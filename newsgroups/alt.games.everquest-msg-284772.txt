There are two distinct lines of root spells; one set is fast casting but 
short duration, the other set is longer to cast but (theoretically) 
longer in duration.  Root is fast cast, Instill long duration, 
Immobilize is the (supposed) upgrade to root, even faster casting.

I used the original root almost always.  Instill is useful in situations 
where you need to park a mob for a more substantial period of time, but 
thats actually fairly rare; most mobs get dealt with, one way or 
another, long before even Root would normally wear off.

Immobilize is even less useful than Instill; its duration is shorter and 
its mana cost is more than twice as much.  Its one nominal advantage, 
the shorter cast time, would make it attractive, if not for a peculiar 
quirk of the item focus effect:

   Spell Haste I affects all spells of cast time 1.0 or longer and level 
20 or under, Spell Haste II affects all spells of cast time 2.0 or 
longer and level 44 and under, and Spell Haste III affects all spells of 
cast time 3.0 or longer and level 60 and under.

   Immobilize is a level 46 spell for a cleric, which means it requires 
spell haste III... but its cast time is too long for SHIII to affect it. 
  Even for wizards and enchanters, its level is 39, which means it 
requires spell haste II... and its cast time is also too long to be 
affected by that.  The other classes which get the spell don't get it 
till their 50s, again, SHIII territory.  The cast time of Immobilize is 
always going to be 1.75.

   Root on the other hand, comes in at under level 20 for all classes 
(except necromancer... do they really get Root or is that some odd 
mistake in Allakhazam), which means SHI items will work on it.  With a 
SHI item equipped, then Root has a cast time of 1.7, actually faster 
than the "upgrade"

Now for some classes thats not a realistic option, but clerics cast 
quite a few spells where having a SHI item is to their noticable 
advantage in just this way; when you're casting root or stun or Divine 
Aura, split seconds can really count.

Instill being level 17 for a wizard would also be affected by SHI, and 
being under 44 for shaman, enchanter, and cleric, would be affected by 
SHII... since its cast time is 2.5 it will work with SHII items, 
although paradoxically there's less reason to wear one of those at high 
levels than a SHI item.  2.5 cast time reduced by a spell haste item 
will be 2.125 seconds... still forever compared to the Fast Cast time of 
either Root or Immobilize.

So why use Instill?  Well, its possible that it will last longer.  Do 
you care?  If you're parking a mob for a substantial period of time, it 
may well be worth it; if you're DOT killing (and using DOT's that don't 
include a nuke component) or if your group is killing relatively slowly 
and you're using rooting as a CC method.

But for me, 9 times out of ten, if I'm rooting a mob its really just a 
temporary measure; I'm making it stand still while I run away, or I'm 
making it stand still so I can get to max range and then nuke it, or I'm 
parking it so the real CC can mez it or the group is killing fast enough 
that its going to be taunted and killed long before its 48 seconds are up.

Its possible (its been so long I don't remember) that at some point mobs 
start being immune to low level roots but can be rooted by higher level 
versions of the spell.  Thats the only reason I can think of that I'd 
stop casting Root.
