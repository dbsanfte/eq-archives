If I sell a level 20 item to someone for a silver or two, essentially
I'm twinking that person, the same as if I sold a high level item for
a plat or two.  And personally I would be embarrassed to wring a
silver or a gold out of a true newbie... if I'm going to give them a
nice item for essentially nothing, I'd just as soon give it to them,
and have both of us feel good.

What we're still left with is that Verant has put items in the game
that are only useful to low level players, but only obtainable by high
level players.  Either they are being careless, or they at least
silently encourage twinking.
