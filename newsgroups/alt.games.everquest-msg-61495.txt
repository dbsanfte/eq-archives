1.5 * 21 = 31

possibly 32, but not sure.

This rule goes all the way up to 40 (still exp with lvl 60) but it's
different for levels 1 to 10. Anything within 2 levels of you gets exp. A
lvl 9 can team up with a lvl 11 for "normal" exp, a lvl 10 can team up with
a lvl 15 to get no reductions.

This is as far as I know. Haven't read up on this issue for a few months now
