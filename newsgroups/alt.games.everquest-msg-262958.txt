Like he said i wasn't flagged, it's not actually that bad now really.  5 of
us (2monks 2 clerics and a paladin) did all 6 trials in the space of about 1
hour.  Maybe it was a bit longer (wasn't really clockwatching, and had to
wait 30 mins for 2 of the trials to unlock from another group).. under 2
hours anyway, with forced downtime.

The best part though is you don't really need a big flagged force to kill
it, we killed it first run with 1 group (5 players, 1 bot), no chanter buffs
(well no chanter buffs after the first AE of the fight, when his mana drain
ae stripped it), and a pali tank.  Change the paladin to a warrior, and im
sure 1 group of way lower gear can do it too.

We didn't know about the mana drain dot (much less that its curable with 1
grc/rc) so inside the 1st minute with spams/dot, mana was below 20 on
clerics. So that negates a big chunk of the gear level on healers... yeah,
easily doable with a group of lesser geared folks imo.
