}Just wondering if this is a known bug.
}repeat steps:
}1) cast improved invisibility on yourself.
}2) have a group member cast group foliage shield.
}result:
}-you a message like, "someone tries to invis you but you are allready
}invis".
}-the improved invisibility icon on your buff list is replaced by foliage
}shield.
}-if viewing yourself in third person. your name has parenthesis around it as
}normal.
}-when you lose invis, you get the foliage shield message (your shimmer of
}leaves fades or whatver).
}-if you try to cast improved invis, it fails becuase you are allready invis.
}now here is the bug part
}-you are NOT invis. monsters and players that cant see invis see you just
}fine. Going through an area
}of hostile creatures that cant see invis, they will attack you.
}
}Ive tested this many times and it repeats every single time. I /bugged it
}but was wondering if this was allready a well known bug.

Well, the specific instance I dunno, but being doubly invisible has always 
been a bit wonky.  Try invising yourself, then hitting hide...
