Just to throw my little thoughts in here.....

If you are saying you liked having ports available to help people out and
NOT for the money, then how is it really harming you that the PoK makes this
easier for everyone?  Those friends of yours are getting the same help as
before.  They are still able to move about with ease, actually even more
ease (being able to do so when nice druids like you are not online or busy,
etc).  The ONLY difference is this help is no longer coming from YOU.  Maybe
you're upset because this ability made you necessary or at the very least
wanted.  If that's the case then you are the one that needs new friends.

Not totally agreeing with either side of the preceding argument just trying
to show things from an alternative perspective.  Point being your friends
(and every other player who purchases PoP) will have the ability to move
around the world a lot easier without having to hassle anyone.  And those
spots that it would be quicker to get to using a port, you will be there to
fill in that gap.  I imagine ports were originally put into the game by the
designers to help getting a group to the fight more efficient.  The fact
that it could be used as a money making method by some is nice and creative,
but not a necessary part of being a druid.  Again, not arguing the money
side of things since that isn't your deal, just saying that an integral part
of your class has NOT been taken away, just the creative use of that ability
has been limited somewhat.

Besides you can still help out those people who don't have PoP for whatever
reason.

Adapt and overcome man, don't whine about something that has already been
done.
