First Question: why in the world are you using AOL?! *gags himself*
Second Question: why in the good green earth are you using AOL?! *gags

Go get a standard, local, non-threating, good speed handling, no bruising,
friendly ISP.  Quit throwing money to AOL. They are EVIL I tell you!! EVIL!
So easy to use we're number 1 my ass!
