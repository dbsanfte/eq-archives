Try the Plaguebones at the Ancient Combine ( Dreadlands.) From the Wizard
spires, run straight until you see the area with all of the pyramids. There
is 1 center pyramid where a lot of them hang out, usually in a group of 2-3.
There are normally about 6-8 in there to begin with. Hit a group of them
with a snare, run them back a bit, then go snare some more to make a group
of 4. Round them up, and AE away. You can med on the top of the pyramid that
faces the "quad pyramid" too. It gives you a good view of the spawns. They
do not walk around the top of it either.  I quadded here in my 40's and the
XP was great. Not much loot though, and sometimes it is camped.
Hope that helps a bit.
