Beastlords -- since I play one myself, I think I can accurately judge, and I
would say:  vaery very overpowered (not that I mind of course :) ).  In PvP
not so much but I think that's only b/c I haven't come up with good PvP
strategies yet.  But.  When I solo with my beastlord, it's not even worth it
to me to kill something that cons lower than yellow or red b/c it just dies
so damn fast and easy.  In groups, my pet is usually main tank and I'm main
assist, occasionally stepping back to heal my pet.  A beastlord & cleric
group is absolutely unstoppable in my experience.  Beastlord & wizard is
also quite powerful and fun :)  Beastlord, wizard, and cleric, and woe to
the PC or mob who tries to step up.
