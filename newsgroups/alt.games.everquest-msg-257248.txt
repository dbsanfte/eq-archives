Yes, I know, this group has probably seem more pictures of my character
drawn than any other. It's my favorite passtime, I think, to not only draw
her, but to get other artists to draw her.

But this is the best yet...no really!  I'm not normally a fan of pixel
art, or "dolls", but this woman is SO damned good I couldn't resist
commissioning her.

(If you want to see the rest of her stuff just strip off the
"/Foxeye.gif".)

But yeah...shiny golden velious armor (that's untinted dragonscale armor,
or polished tin stuff, if anyone is curious), Qeynos hills, Foxeye's
signature nose, Sally the staff, the trusty backpack that no good wanderer
is happy without, and the awesome touch of the bluejay feathers...that's
the best one yet.

The next one I'm waiting on is Saraquael's version. ^_^ Every good EQ'er
needs a Saraquael...or that's the excuse I tell myself.
