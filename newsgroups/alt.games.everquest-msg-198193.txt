I have a lot of trouble understanding why so few people see the
obvious there.  We're talking "guild" accounts, i.e. shared accounts,
that are tag teamed 24x7 until the desired goal is reached.  In other
words, each of those represents not one idiot, but several working in
concert.  In addition to the "guild" accounts you will have people
working in shifts to build up one another's bot armies.  From the
simplest case of a duo where each player in tern plays both characters
(so that you and your buddy both have a constant stream of xp), to
more ambitious sorts who'll play 4 or more characters at a time.

The one thing I suspect is that behind Cypher are several people who
play EQ as a business, pharming loot and characters for sale.  It my
suspicion is correct I see two obvious consequences:  (1) it'll really
fuck up the high level game on Stromm, and it'll fuck it up fast, and
(2) it'll be so excruciatingly obvious that SOE will not be able to
miss it unless they deliberately ignore it, which will likely result
in some very noisy rabble-rousing that they'll have an even more
difficult time ignoring.  But then again, after what I've read about
Stormhammer, maybe it'll just be business as usual to them.
