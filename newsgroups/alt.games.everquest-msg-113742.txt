 I've done some research and I think my best bet for hutning right now would
be on the moon. Problem is, everytime I go there (at least in dawnshroud) my
framerate (heh I think thats what its called) slows down so much it looks
like I'm watching in slow motion, making it unplayable. Here is what I have:

Pentium III 850
640MB RAM
GeForce 2 32MG Video Card

Do I need a new video card? A new computer? Or is the problem my 56k
connection? I'm a little bit weak on the tech stuff so hopefully someone can
help me out. Thanks.
