I've mostly solo'd my ranger to 53, and I've also played my shaman to 54
(mainly grouping).  I've had a blast playing both ways.
I've recieved my fair share of people trying to tell me how much of a waste
of time soloing is, but I've never paid them much heed and I won't until
they start paying my monthly fee.

You pay to play for your own fun.  Let others make all the comments they
want.  You are right, its about what each person enjoys the most.  There's
always going to be those people that try to force their values on you and
tell you that you aren't supposed to have fun doing it "that way".  Just
shrug it off and go enjoy doing what 'you' want to do.
