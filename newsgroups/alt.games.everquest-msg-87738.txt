I know it's not my guild, but you shouldn't "bleh" at some
guild's policy on invites so flippantly.  Most of the higher
level guilds have those restrictions in to prevent the "hi
im bobs frend ne1 have a FBSS for me?" right off the
bat, and probation is usually in place to prevent the
"i'm a level 60 enchanter bought on Ebay and I will gate
and /q the first time I see 10 mobs at a time in Fear"
thing from happening.

If you don't like a guild's invite policey, odds are you
wouldn't like the guild anyways.
