lol.

Although that comment is even sillier. Since it refers to a limit
built into the fundamental architecture of the machine. Bill-boys
version is

"No one will *ever* need more than 640K"

Mine was more like

"This machine will be a boat-anchor before I need more than 256Mb"

And I guess we were both wrong. Although i'm loathe to buy more
ram when what I really should do is wait and buy a new box. Which
is hard to justify because linux runs like a dream on it.
