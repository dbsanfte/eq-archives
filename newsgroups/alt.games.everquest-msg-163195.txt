This was me till recently :) It's a bit of a challenge being stuck entirely
in the very Old World.

As a wizard, I started soloing HG's at 39 or so. A little dangerous, but
do-able. Up till that point I was soloing/grouping at Split Paw in the
entrance (and further in, if it was a good group). The gnolls drop plat and
fine steel, and there's a decent zone modifier on the XP.

good luck!
