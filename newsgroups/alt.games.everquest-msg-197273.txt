Nothing is wrong, your melee days are over.
Priests have insanely horrible melee, as do int casters.
It is not worth using and a druid just can't really field the ac at
your level that even a cleric can (plate class.)

Your whole thing now is kind of not getting hit. Get hit sometimes
instead if grouping, eventually your defense skill will always be
maxxed since it becomes kind of impossible not to get hit.

You should not be going toe to toe with anything that is xp, or even
high greens.
