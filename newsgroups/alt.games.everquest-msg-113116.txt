What I would do is buy some armor (or kill some low orcs not sure if they
drop some) head over to East Freeport. Once at East Freeport go into the
"newbie" area (The area with monsters you are able to slay). Once you see
that place, head out a little ways and turn RIGHT. Head right untill you hit
the wall, then go foward and you should reach Northern Desert of Ro (Nro).
Here you should find monsters around your level. Dont go to far or you might
get lost. (Note it should be a sandy/desert area, you can tell the limit of
where that level of monsters end is when grass starts to appear and there
are some inns. Also there should be one female merchant out on the desert
area some place. One last thing, beatles that are floating or any creature
floating most likely has TWO not just one there.)
