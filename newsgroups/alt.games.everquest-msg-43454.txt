I have had to set bounds for myself with EQ, in order to do just that - read
(and other things). And it has actually improved my gameplay in that I don't
waste any time in the game anymore if I don't have to. I may have to work little
harder, but I spend only a fraction of the time I used to in EC auctioning crap.
It's faster to give it away and get back to exping (and looting, at 35pp per HG,
at least when my turn comes around, cos I can't quite solo one yet :P).

P.S.: I know exactly what you mean about MUDs - the people who still play
Medievia that I talk to on ICQ can't believe I dropped everything and left when
I got EQ again, and I just tell them - try it.
