Drive letter changing is in the disk management snap in of the Computer 
Management console...

Right click on the partition you wish to change, select 'change drive 
letter'

To zap the C drive completely... you have a couple of options. My 
personal favorite would be to use your drive brand's free disk test 
software (they all have free disk test software) and do a write test on 
it. (low level format, write zeros, depends on the brand)

Alternatively, go get a windows 98 boot disk from here:
http://www.bootdisk.com/bootdisk.htm
use it's old fdisk to delete the non dos partition. Then you can boot 
off your XP cd and it will do the ntfs format for you during the install.
