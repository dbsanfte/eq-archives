No I am arrogant . Lokari is actually fairly nice and tame.

The only thing amusing about you and your comment is that sometime somewhere
you will be in a place where the only one you can count on is YOU. You will
sink or swim completely on your own worth. The amusing thing is that you
will most likely sink and make nice flailing gestures as you slowly gurgle
away.

There is absolutely no excuse for believing that the world owes you anything
as your birthright especially when that right comes at anothers expense or
work. Learn to do your own work and eventually you will become a man.

There is no substitue for victory or excellence.
