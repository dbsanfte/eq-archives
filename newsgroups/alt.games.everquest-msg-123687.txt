Alright, I'm following up on myself, how embarassing.  :)

But I just started to think: mages are absolutely, postively,
100% dependent on their pets -- which means they are absolutely,
postively, 100% dependent on malachite.  A mage without a pet
(that is, without malachite) is a dead mage.

Any caster class that isn't reagent dependent *and* can summon
or forage food/water is actually LESS gear dependent than the
mage.  Unless I'm mistaken, that puts at least necros and
wizards above mages for being least dependent on gear.

The wizard that can't forage can at least teleport herself to
a non-KOS city for food/water supplies, too.  A mage can't.
So a mage far from a non-KOS city is at a terribly disadvantage,
especially since a mage can't root/snare/evac/teleport.

So I'm no longer sure mages even make the "top 3" of "least
gear dependent classes", since by their nature, they're
hopelessly dependent on malachite.  It's just ONE gear
requirement, but it's a "must have", no matter what race the
mage is.

On the other hand, several other classes have ZERO gear
dependencies, given they're a race that can forage OR a
class that can summon food/water.  True 100% gear
independence, a state a mage can never, ever reach.
