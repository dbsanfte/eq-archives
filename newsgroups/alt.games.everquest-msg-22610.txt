Ok, having read here about the only "Feast" size meal in Norrath
requiring Lake Rathe Muskies, and having an alt laying about with a
master fishing skill, I took it upon myself to go catch seven stacks of
the buggars.  This was, of course, without having looked at the recipie
for what all would be required to make the wonderful feast size food
with the nice stats.
  One of the other ingrediants turns out to be snake egg oil.  And yes,
every dose of it must be brewed using a snake egg. I spent several
sessions when not playing my main taking this character around the
closest newbie area (W. Freeport and E. Commons) trying to collect snake
eggs. I've tried /acutions and /oocs to try to bribe the newbies to
collect them for me. In between times, I've killed everything that
slithers, from asps to grass snakes, saving up all the eggs. Thus far,
*several* hours of effort had produces about two and a half stacks. Even
assuming minimal failurs for a master brewer, I figure I'm going to need
at least 8 stacks of eggs.
  Any insight into where these elusive eggs will be the most plentiful,
or any other ways to get them in volume?  This is getting seriously
aggrivating.  At least the fish wine components are all easily available
via purchase or fishing.
