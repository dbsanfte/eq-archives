Yes, like the /gems game to take your mind off of having to sit on your
keister for flipping-ever.

I am NOT complaining about the monster PC ability. Very cool. Good for the
game as a novelty item.

I DO think Mechanic has a legitimate point however. All the things that need
work and resources are spent on something so trivial? All the heated debates
on class balance, spells, bugs, items and downtime and this gets picked up?

Probably it was more like somebody whipped up the code on their lunch break,
showed it to their boss and they threw it in just because it was a cool
thing to do and didn't take any resources.

Whatever. I'm not going to fret about it either way.
