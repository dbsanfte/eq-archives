Ulthorks in EW drop Ulthork armor, which retails for around 30 pp
a piece, and Velium weaponry, which retails for around 10pp, both
cases to players back on the mainland.  I've moved on to LGuk
at the moment, and am annoyed to find similar level mobs dropping
FS weaponry instead of Velium.  Velium has the same stats as
FS, but is magic, which makes it much more useful for those
hunting the wily and popular will-o-wisps and ghouls.  Don't worry
about the proc, it won't work till over 25th, and by then your
customers shouldn't be buying velium.

Tizmaks in GD are another good source of regular fast moving
pickups, with good exp and decent loot; the armor they drop
is only good for 8 to 11 pp a piece, but they have rare drop
Cured pieces worth 200pp instead, and drop the blunt velium
weapons to go with the Ulthork dropped slashers.

Kodiaks, also in GD, are very popular, although they drop little,
other than the kodiak claws you might get 20 or 30 pp for... relatively
rare drop though.  I personally find I die every time I hunt Kodiaks,
though, not from the mobs we've engaged, but from spills off of
other groups that have overpulled and died!  Five times there, five
deaths.  They are also higher level than Tizmaks, and located further
from Thurgadin.
