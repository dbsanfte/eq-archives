Noone ever said that he should get a free ride, my point was, with /roleplay
or /anon, you'll never get tells in the first place.  Now granted, if I were
asking, I would have made a reasonable offer of platinum, and a "Sorry,
busy" would suffice to set my feet running, as I implied, maybe your
arguement should be about rudeness, not laziness. In addition, last time I
checked, druids got a port to DL, all you'd have to do is port him, port
back, and run to resume what you were doing.  Not saying that it's not an
inconveiniance, but a quick /role or /anon, might save you the need to gripe
about it.

Possibly, possibly not, I know people that take two or more minutes to zone,
for various reasons.  A level 61 warrior may not have run3+, and likely
doesn't have SoW/SoE/FoE, It *could* reasonably take 15 minutes to get from
DL to PoK under these conditions.  Then again, maybe he's one of those
players who think classes are different and have different abilities for a
reason. /shrug
