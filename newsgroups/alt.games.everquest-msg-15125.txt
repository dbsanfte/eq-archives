He is in South Qeynos past the bank. Just a little advice. Go ahead and take
the time to visit all the merchants in that area (as well as any others you
meet in the city) and discover what they sell. You will learn a lot about
what is available for how much and the differences in prices for things.
Talk to them by "hailing" them. The buying and selling of things (loot) is a
large piece of this game and one often overlooked at first. People usually
start off wanting to kill things and ignoring the need to take the time and
sell the loot they earn and buy armor and better weapons. Get in the habit
now of right-clicking all the items a merchant has and discovering the
variety and special abilities these items have. Just because a knife the
merchant is selling looks like a rusty knife doesn't mean it might not be a
magical one instead. Just because your character can wear a hat doesn't mean
you can wear every hat for sale.

Also when you get a little more familiar with the city and maybe the next
zones around it, go research some of the quests that are available to you on
some of the Everquest related web sites. I found that after doing this, the
game became ever more enjoyable and expansive to me.
As far as your skills go, put one practice point in each of them and as you
gain levels and use these skills, they will get better and stronger with
use. As you understand the game better, you will probably start other
characters and can use your knowledge to refine their makeup and abilities.
Have fun
