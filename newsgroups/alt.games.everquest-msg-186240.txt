It sounds like you need to learn how to budget your money better.

In any case, I think a combination of teleporting pads (that you
must reach by foot before you can use them as a destination from
other teleport pads) and NPCs porters *might* do the trick.  (Not
be perfect, but strike a good balance.)

My non-twink wizard had to kill *one hundred* dangerous mobs to gain

: So what's all this about travel being too easy?

It's too easy for True Newbies (tm).  I agree that fast and easy
travel seems like a good idea for experienced players, because by
then, the experience of travel has become mundane and tedious.

I'm just trying to think of a solution that encourages True
Newbies (tm) to get as much as they can out of the game.
