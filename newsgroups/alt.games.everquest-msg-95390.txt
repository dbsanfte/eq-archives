In my low 20's now and finding out I have a lot of new stuff to learn.  I've
spent a lot of time learning how to play my class, but know very little
about other classes.  Except druids (druids can sow-yeah druids!) But I am
NOT an old dog, I CAN learn new tricks, I just have to be taught.  The
difficult part at this stage is that most newbie players have played only
ONE class, or one or two others, but at low levels.  They (me) are not aware
of the various tactics available to other classes and how those abilities
can best be utilized in a group.  The only tactic they know is to slash and
bash everything in sight, before it bashes you.  I think the best way to get
your point across is to to take a leadership role, most of us (if we are
smart) would appreciate this from a more experienced player.  Tell the group
your strategy and how it works and what part they will play.

Example:  OK everyone, we get a lot of Add's out here and it can get pretty
rough.  I will mezz the Add's and you take them out one at a time. Everyone
attack the same MOB. Does everyone have an assist hotkey? (just learned
about this about 5-6 levels ago-some may not know)  "Insert name here" will
be our main tank, everyone hit what he hits.  Thats called assisting.

I know it sounds pretty basic and maybe tedious, but will probably save time
in the long run and create a stronger group.

Good Luck with your noobs.
