    Heh, I'm not the one whining, the original poster is. And if you check
my post history you'll find that I'm far from positive about DAoC....

    Nope, you didn't. You did mention after the quoted part about how Inner
Fire was the BST's better heal, though, implying a low level BST. They start
casting at level 9, by which point the original poster would already have a
Fungi on his character (not that he'd stay level 9 for long with a Fungi
on). So question to you, DT: at what level would someone med back the mana
from Inner Fire at the same pace as a Fungi could heal them?
