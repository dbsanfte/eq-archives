Hi.

It's a good server, but very brutal if you don't have friends playing on it.
Everyone is anon (forced, can't change), there is no OOC, shout has a very
small range and /auction only works in towns.
So finding groups is extremely hard. There is also the lowest population on
it.
And lets not forget about TLC (trivial loot code).
