Due to the nature of IP networking, there is no way to determine
immediately whether or not a user accidentally disconnected.

Even if Verant wanted to, they couldn't implement what you want.
The best they can do is pick an arbitrary number of seconds of
lack of connectivity and decide you're link dead at that point.

Too small of a number, and people get disconnected due to lag
spikes.  Too big of a number, and people die while their character
gets hacked on.  Really, their current solution is about as good
as it's going to get.
