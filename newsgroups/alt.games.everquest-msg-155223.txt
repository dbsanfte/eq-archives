I totally agree. I'm just suggesting that's how *they* see it. They 
probably don't understand how much mana it requires, and 10pp is 
probably quite a lot of money to them so they think this would be a 
large factor in your decision to Aego them. I'm not saying they are 
justified in seeing it that way, just suggesting its the way they look 
at it.

Personally, the arrogance in *expecting* it like its their god given 
right as you say would annoy me greatly too, enough to refuse the 
request without politeness. I don't play any real buffing classes so 
I've been spared this.
