this is called a price of entering the market. Infrastructure costs are huge
while each additional unit of produced goods is miniscule. When you are
looking for investors for a new enterprise though they consider the WHOLE
cost to get a buisness started and thus make an informed decision. In the
USA to keep the playing field level and to keep clutter of the landscape it
was also legislated that the owners of the poles already up would be
required to rent space to other companies as long as such rental did not
constitute a burden on the owners.

> how do you handle putting in new phone/electricity/whatever lines
> to every home?

by renting structure already there and by requiring the builders of new
structure to pay the costs of construction or when renovating to require the
current owners of property to pay those costs. For instance every time a
city annexes an area they will run sewage lines and bill each landowners
around 5k for the averageplot of land for the privelege.

The increase in effeciency of a monopoly provider is largely a myth. There
is no advantage gained by having just one power company and a host of
disadvantages.
