Your reccolection of it being broken as described is correct. However, I
can confirm that it is now working again. (And has been for a while.)
With our characters on Test, Tarra is already a master of all the player
languages and quite a few of the oddball ones. We did it all with group
chat spam. (While selling in the bazaar on her character, I created a
series of throwaway first level characters of all the races, used the
PoK books to get them to the bazaar, and trained her in all of them.)
We've also been doing the "two points here, two points there" bit on
some of the unusual ones.
