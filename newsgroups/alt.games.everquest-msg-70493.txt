My character is currently camped/bound on Kunark where I have been hunting
Giants in Warslik's Woods with my Druid buddy.  Last night he wasn't on and
I was half way to 25 so I got really brave and soloed...  LOL  Ok, so maybe
you guys are thinking that it doesn't take all that much bravery to solo on
Kunark if you know what you're doing...  but considering I had NEVER
wandered around at all "Overthere" I was terrified.

Once I zoned Overthere (zoning takes about 2 min from WW to OT for me
btw...ick) I started killing anything dark blue.  Foraged a bunch of very
bizarre things including a shell that looks like a turd...  Anyway, my
exploits last night now result in my sig being changed slightly...  hehe

That's what I did.  Anyone else?
