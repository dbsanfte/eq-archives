I was very surprised by the developers of EQ2 stating there would be no 
corpse runs in EQ2 -- that it makes people wish they had never even 
played that day -- and that instead of xp loss (and consequent level 
loss) there would be xp "deficit" instead.  Very smart choice on their 
part.

But apparently they are not going to implement this in EQ1; perhaps 
because it would tick off those people having corpse summoning and 
corpse locating abilities.  Other than that I can think of no reason why 
the developers would be so two-faced on this issue.  I do not think two-
faced is two harsh a term here because when I read the EQ2 developers 
comments their words were very very strongly against corpse runs and xp 
loss but are they going to improve EQ1 in this regard?  Noooooooooo!
