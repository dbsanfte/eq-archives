Its is okay, but I am used to using the wheel mouse to scroll up in
text. I disabled mine. I wish there was a one button brief overlook,
so I can get an overhead shot that only lasts as long as I depress the
key. I could press "o", go to overhead, release "o" and go back to the
previous view.

Not a bad thing for looking to see how close a mob is when kiting. I
hate turning around in time to see the mob hitting you.
