You are comparing a One Hand Slash to a Two Hand Slash.  Both are very good
swords, but it depends upon which weapon skill you are working on.

My Ranger uses a BALS and my r/l Mate's Barbarian Warrior uses a BABS (among
a slew of other weapons).  The BABS does more damage as it is a bigger
weapon.  It also has a greater delay.

You didn't mention your class (Unless I missed it as it is very late here),
but you should choose the sword most appropriate for your Class.

Good Hunting!
