Color me clueless, but I'd been seeing that for the last few weeks and never
did figure out what it meant until now.  At first I thought it was some sort
of time zone thing, and they were looking for people on the west cost who
could play during the same times, but realized that I wasn't seeing
appreviations for the other time zones, so that wasn't it.

I am dum nome.
