Really outside of someone who only has a computer to play EQ its
pretty likely that everyone would upgrade to 98 or xp or something. 

What this refund does is give someone who is NEVER going to upgrade
win95 an option to completely leave the game and get purchase price
plus. That is why the chars have to be perm deleted because it is your
ACCOUNT which says you can play velious, kunark and sol. So, if a
person got a several add on and time paid ahead refund... as the other
poster said they could just get all the files from a friend (easy to
burn eq dir on to some cds) then go back to using their old account
only paying 9.95 a month.

This is a serious option for someone who is absolutely never going to
upgrade win95. I'd think almost every pc gamer would have to at least
98. 

You can easily enough edit the dxdiag.txt file from another computer
or your friends with win 95, in a few minutes. 

The way they have it originally set up is what makes it so they have
to do the refund this way. Otherwise I and 350,000 other users could
claim we were on win 95 and get some free 6 months for upgrading to 98
or whatever. 

Basically if you are still using win 95 on your computer and don't
know ANYONE with a win98 cd you could EASILY install, your name is
Osama and you are living in a cave. Either that or its time to get out
of the basement you've been playing EQ in for 2.5 years and go say hi
to some modern world "daylight" nerds.
