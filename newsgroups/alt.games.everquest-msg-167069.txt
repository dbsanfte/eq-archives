I'm looking to lead a Naggy raid later today, and have been pondering Naggy
and Vox strategies for weeks now. I'd like a little input on a few ideas I
have.

I usually have a Cleric that is part of a support group (53+). Is the hate
check constant over the life of a remedy spell, or just when it first lands?
My thinking is that a high cleric could do a minor, but still helpful
participation in the raid by putting Ethereal on a toon (the FD'er in
Naggy's case, the MA for Vox or both) right before they run into the room.
My notion is that they would not be on the hate list yet at casting, but
would still enjoy the late effects of that spell as they are first getting
beat on. Seems to me that would shouldn't have to worry about the high
cleric getting bounced as long as the target hadn't yet aggoed the dragon at
the time of initial casting.

Along this vein: I know that casting a heal on a FD'd person will break the
FD. Is this only checked as the spell lands? Again, can a ER or CR land,
then have the FD'er FD, but still enjoy the over time benefits without
breaking the FD?

For Naggy, I've seen an "Everyone just storm in" approach. I'm thinking,
however, that I'm more partial to sending in a 50+ monk to run straight to
the back (to the other side of the lava bridge there) - attempting to pull
Naggy back there - and then FD. The MA would be running in just behind, but
would attempt to not draw aggro until the Monk FD's. My thought is that this
gets Naggy to the back and allows the healers to enter the north end of the
room (before the lava bridge), be in healing range, but NOT be in the AoE
range. I know that offense casters need to be in melee range to cast on
Naggy, but the heal recipients should be able to get it from outside the AoE
range.

Can folks comment on these notions?
