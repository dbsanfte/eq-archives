We were down there last night trying to get a drop for one of our SK's
Greenmist. We had a spectacular train at one point; at least 14
assorted badass critters had decided they wanted to follow us around.
It would definitely have been screenshot material, if only I'd been
able to turn around and look at them before they minced me. I also
dinged 57 before I had to go sleep.

Well, it's a damned nice shield you want to upgrade to :) I've
occasionally considered doing that quest, but don't think I will until
I have cable. Want to finish my epic first, and I'd rather have a Lodi
shield than the bane warding :)
