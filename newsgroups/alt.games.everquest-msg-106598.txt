    Bah, I do the odd bit of pulling. There's places where only something as
low-aggro as Mark of Karn can split mobs, and when stuff gets back to the
group I can always Divine Aura and back off. It's not a good idea for pulls
with large numbers or really hard hitters, but for mundane stuff we're ok.
We do have the same tools as a paladin, after all. :-)

    Only if she uses a really low level nuke, and DA's when they get close.
Otherwise she might have been better off casting Root (if they can be
rooted), to stagger the arrival times and make it easier for you to get
aggro on anything that won't be mezzed. MoK would be ideal because of the
low aggro, if she has her Thurg/PoG BP (she's sub-56 still, right?)

    Evolution in action!
