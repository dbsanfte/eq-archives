Hm, if the reduction in damage taken is about the same for both,
and the reduction in damage dished out is also about the same,
it sounds like one important difference would be vs mobs with
damage shields.  (But I haven't fought enough mobs with big DS's
to know what sort of tactics are involved.  Maybe it's standard
operating procedure to just dispel the DS, or overwrite it with
the clerical "negative" DS I've read about.)
