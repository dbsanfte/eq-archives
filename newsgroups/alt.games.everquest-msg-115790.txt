Ever considered the fact that the druids might need the furs for the 8th 
shawl themselves?
Had 3 guys call me names in WW when i answered i was hunting velium 
hound, but im hunting for my own shawl.

You might as well shout at everyone who kill the AC in Sro for MQing. 
Hes random spawn just as the velium hounds, but dont see anyone 
complaining about greedy druids farming AC all the time.
