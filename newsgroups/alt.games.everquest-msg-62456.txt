Heck, I just saw some more screenshots at
http://www.eqloft.com/encyclopedie/luclin/galerie3.html .
Due to similar eyes/mouth, I strongly suspect my main character is on
http://www.eqloft.com/encyclopedie/luclin/images/luclin103.html (what
on earth have they done with her lovely chestnut haircolor?!?) and
there is no way on earth I am forking out money to buy more memory so
I can view myself as THAT. 

(Side notes: what's a high elf doing with the warrior epic? And I
don't think I hate the female half elf. Big whoop. I pity the male
characters - whether they're a burly race, normal race or frail race,
they've all got cartoony overly wide torsos/shoulders)
