If a weapon has a base damage (ie the damage listed on the weapon) of
GREATER THAN DOUBLE the damage your pet does with plain fists, then give it
the weapon and it will do more damage.
Equipping pets with weapons will not affect delay at all. Only haste
buffs/items will do that.
Basically big 2handers are great, but Necro pets start punching for 12-ish
at about level 12 and it's hard to find weapons better than that that aren't
too expensive to waste on a pet, too heavy to carry til needed, or that the
pet won't refuse to equip.
So by all means arm your level 4 and 8 pets. After 12 it's pretty much
pointless though apart from for looks.
