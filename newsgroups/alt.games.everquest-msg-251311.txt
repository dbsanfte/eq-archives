You all missed the point. Here's what he said originally:

"Anyone ever buy the make-loads-of-platinum-in-everquest guides and have
success?

Im tempted to get one but I have no Idea which one is good if any of the are
good at all."

1)He fails to stipulate he desires an QUICK guide to plat, just a SUCCESSFUL
one. You only assumed he wanted the easiest way out.

2)Pay for veggies and fruit? Hello can you say wood elves, half elves,
iksars and the classes ranger and druid? They have one thing in common,
Forage. Use it. Plus you need to be good to go into Rivervale to get the
jumjums.

3)Trivial 335 you say it as if it were hard. 250 Baking is the easiest
tradeskill to get. I chose to omit the trivial because I new some noob would
be scared of it. If trivial 335 is so difficult maybe you should try to
challenge yourself rather than go with your comfort blanket of "killing mobs
for a few plat." How is pressing "A" for attack 200 times versus clicking
Combine a few hundres times any more or less impressive anyway?

It's amusing how you try to discredit my successful idea (not my own either,
I'm just using what Sony gave me) simply because it is not impressive and a
testament to your masculinity (from the Conan reference, obviously its what
you wish yourself to be, but I won't go there). Point is, I make loads of
plat, but you can believe it or not for yourself, it affects me not.
