I am a Level 30 Enchanter, and have had the grandest experience with this
character. There is much to learn, an Enchanter has more spells than any other
character.

Suffice it it say that there will come a time when you can no longer find pet
spells.  Get ye to High Pass Hold, and High Pass Keep (hint - level 12 or so).
There, ye can find all manner of Enchanter pet spells for higher levels.

Yet, BE AFRAID!!!!  Ye must pass through many beastly encounters - even, the
dreaded Kithicor Forest.  Tread this in daylight only, for at night the UnDead pass
here - and your invisible spell works not upon them.

At level 12 Enchanter, you will be able to begin the Stien of Moggok ( or the
"Glowing Stien" ) Quest.  Ask a higher level Enchanter to guide you.  You should be
able to get 200 to 300 plats each time you complete it.  I did, and I did it more
than 16 times :-)  !!

As you do this quest, you will learn so much about Everquest, you will be well
equiped to continue your travels into the many zones.  When you are able to learn
the BREEZE spell, go to Friona Vrie on the Kunkark continent, and get it.  Danger
is all about on the Kunark Continent.  Be afraid.  Be very afraid.
