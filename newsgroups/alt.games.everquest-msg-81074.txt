OK, I thought of the regen thing, but realized that it is absolutely 
useless at higher levels.  The pretty thing I guess is an 'eye of the 
beholder' bit, but who am I to judge.  Hell, I think halfling chicks are 
cute.
I am intrigued by a gnoll warrior.  Are you going to name him Fippy and 
just charge the guards as soon as you respawn?  Maybe just bind yourself 
in front of the guards for truly effecient gnoll warrior action.
