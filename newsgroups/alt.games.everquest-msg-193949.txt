In a raid situation, live with it.  It's 10% less haste than SLTW for less 
mana, and less time spent recasting it every 16 minutes.  In a group XP 
situation, depends how many melee are in the group.

SLTW costs 250 mana and lasts 16 minutes.
ToA costs 750 mana and lasts 36 minutes.

This means it's cheaper to cast ToA if there are 2 or more melee in the 
group.  At level 64, where a shaman actually gets to choose which to use, 
how many melee will not be at over 90% haste with a 50% spell haste cast on 
them?
