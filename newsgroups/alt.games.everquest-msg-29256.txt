Sad yet true,
    When I was around level 40 I've met a nice guy who was level 16 at the
time, and we remained friends for a fairly long period. Now I am level 51
and he is 52 and his alts are  around in their 30's (I thought I played a
lot of EQ playing 4-5 hours a night). He plays the game at LEAST 16 hours a
day, I kid you not. I have seen him turn from a nice casual gamer guy to an
EQ addict that doesn't have a job and quit his studies because he told me he
was "Too busy".
     I remember how he used to do lots of tradeskills, do quests, Roleplay a
lot(that's how we became friends) and help his friends out at any cost. Now
he has just turned into a pathetic levelling / Item farming machine.
The day he told me he had an argument with his Girlfriend about him playing
for too long. He told his Girlfriend if it came down to choosing  between EQ
and her he would go with EQ. I went off at him here calling him a moron,
idiot etc. :(
    He now refuses to speak to me,
It was that day I decided that I shouldn't play EQ too much and it's only a
game.
I now only play around 2 hours a night at most, but we must face the fact
that Everquest is made by power gamers, for Powergamers,
