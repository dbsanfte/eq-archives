    Update - they got it last night. The focus patch was just enough to put
them over the top.

    We have no respect for guilds that try to rush past folks. If you get
beat, suck it up and move on. Recently we raced a guild to Cazic Thule, whom
we hadn't killed in ages (and our number one "I want this loot" item is the
Bile Drenched Choker). There was a smaller guild already in zone. We had the
numbers over the guild we were racing - we could kill Cazic with the people
who were there, they couldn't with what they had there. Then the smaller
guild informed us they had called the other guild in when Cazic popped. So
we left. We've also avoided waiting in Kael for the zerg guild to die to AoW
so we could pull him, even though that means a blown spawn when they fail.
It's common courtesy.

    We do that as well. Yours would be the first guild I'd ever heard of
that doesn't, to be honest.

    Vyemm is actually harder because of the rooting - you have to keep him
facing the wall at all times, or else he sends everyone flying out into the
lava/other drakes.

    When my guild first started doing NToV (second on server), the first
guild tried exactly the same thing with exactly the same result. Our server
GM told us in no uncertain terms that if we didn't work something out we'd
both be out of NToV for a month. That was just what was needed to bring the
other guild to the negotiating table. ;-)

    We only had the one bump going into NToV. And they never trained us on
purpose - they're pretty honourable that way. We have been trained,
ironically enough, by Wraith when they were trying to get into the NToV
rotation. And this was after they'd wiped to Aaryonar and we'd cleared there
to CR them. The next respawn, when it was the other big guild's turn, a
flurry or two were parked in the rotunda as a warning to Wraith to stay out.
And I'd never seen the other big guild do anything that overt before. Wraith
is just hated on our server.

    You'd better put on your shades - the sunshine is quite blinding. 70
plus for NToV, maybe 50 for the average raid day. People that haven't been
on in ages show up on NToV days so they can try and increase the E-Bay value
of their characters. I use an Orb of the Infinite Void, and the NToV cleric
shield dropped - my WIS is 218 so it was quite an upgrade. I passed on it to
let another cleric that needed the resists more get it. People were
shocked - NBG, in NToV? Imagine!!

    There are. Many of the Ssra mobs have AoEs that annihilate any zerg
force that tries them. FoH may complain that because of the offtanking
requirements on some mobs (like HP and Emperor) that the encounters are
designed to be zerged, but I strongly disagree - they're designed for a
specific turnout range, not for "50 and up".

> We've only attemped Shei once (I
> wasn't on and I don't think we had massive turnout)..

    *CRUNCH* There's what, four mobs that MUST be offtanked from the start
and Shei will make an add (with his Shei touch ability) every two minutes?
He's not the kind of mob you can have low turnout for.

> Does shei spawn a mob when somebody FD's?  Originally I was told he does..

    No idea - we've never had someone FD unless we're being wiped out and
monks are flopping to be corpse pullers.

    Um, the cloak is droppable, you know. Why would it rot? (And even if it
weren't, 8 primary stat 50 MANA and 30 points of saves is pretty nice for a
caster cloak). I'm hoping to pick up one for one of my caster twinks when I
eventually get my seventh shawl and spawn a Dain for the guild.

> Dains shield rots too..

    That, I understand. Even though it's an improvement over the average
non-guilded person's shield (usually Crystal Chitin or Sarnak ), it isn't an
improvement over an OotIV or a NToV random rare shield - and that's what we
all have.

    Crown has no HPs, and that's not acceptable. Plus more and more people
are hitting the AC soft cap with regular gear, so the biggest plus of the
crown isn't considered so hot.
