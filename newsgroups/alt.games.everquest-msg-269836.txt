You can think whatever you like but comparing character slots to options 
like air or p/s is bullshit.

When you buy EQ you can make any one of the 40+ different character 
types. The game -comes- with support for all of them, the subscription -
comes- with support for all of them.

Character slots are not an expansion to the base game. They merely let 
you play with more of the options you've already purchased -at the same 
time-.

If you bought a car that *included* air conditioning, powersteering, and 
a cd player. (Ie the components were *all* already IN the car that you 
are driving, but the dealership set it up so that in order to have the 
radio on at the same time you used the Power Steering you had to pay an 
extra monthly fee then we'd have a much closer approximation for what 
EQ2 is doing with such limited character slots. (And EQ2 is worse, 
because you -can- delete characters to free the slot for new characters, 
but that means you have start over from scratch on the old character if 
you want to play him some more... at least when you turn the radio back 
on after making a tight turn you don't have to start the CD at track 1 
again.

This is self evident. I've already said I haven't bought EQ2.

But for what its worth, there is a considerable difference between 
buying the car without options, and buying the car with the options 
included and then having to pay extra to actually use them.

It was better than yours.
