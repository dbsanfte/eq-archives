200 is the maximum skill level, only thing you can do to increase it is use 
a tradeskill modifier, such as a geerlock, that will modify your skill 
level up.  The Geerlock will add 5% to your skill, giving you an effective 
skill of 210.  Might be an AA to reduce failures on research too, not sure, 
have not checked ever.
