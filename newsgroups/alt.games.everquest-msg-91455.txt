  FV is underpopulated, but if you start (or move to) any of the "population
centers" you should be surrounded by a fair number of people.  Any character
that starts in or around Kelethin, Freeport or Qeynos should see a good number
of other people start outing.  Of course, you may not be able to talk to them...
