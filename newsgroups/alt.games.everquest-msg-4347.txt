<replying to Throm>
He couldn't petition you.  The play nice policy doesn't mean that he can
reserve a camp.  It means he has to share the camp.  Now beyond that, if I
see a spawn is camped I won't butt in because that's rude, but in the case
you mention he was just trying to take that too far.  Good for you that you
were wise enough to realize he had no business there.
