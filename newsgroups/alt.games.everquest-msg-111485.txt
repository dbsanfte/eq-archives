    I wouldn't have the patience for that. 800 HPs - two minutes or more of
being Feigned?

    There's shaman wanderers, AND the place has two levels. Imagine the fun
if you attacked a shaman wanderer whose pet had fallen into the water and
ended up somewhere down below. It would be as bad as when Kunark was
released with warping Shrooms. There are mobs with pets in Sebilis, like the
SK frogs in Crypt and Tolapmuj, but I think they're all statics.

    Most people that "solo" it are just clearing the front part, up to the
stage. You'd just have the Gruplinort PH to deal with if you're worried
about Ilis frogs, and it's always a wizard so you wouldn't have to deal with
a lot of melee. Ever since I heard that monks could do this I've been
amazed.

    The area looks like it would be a load of fun. The Juggs dropped a huge
number of spells, and the Tolapmuj Robe is a great twink item (especially if
you've also let those baby casters loot some nice weapon, like my
necromancer's 13/20 scythe). But we're stuck XPing in Ssra until everyone
has rings, sigh.
