So here I am walkin to S K plains and i talk to this guy tels me about a
sword quest i figure why not.....

First get to Kaladim and find fisherman.. kanthuk... Looked forever finally
found him..

Second Llara, someplace called the cauldron im told... So I stumble in a
13th lvl warrior, notice levels of others and get killed about three times
finding her, then stupidly type without hitting enter got to love the a
key...

Finally get note for Ruathey, and no one knows who or where this person
is...

Im stuck and probaly under leveled for this quest, but also stubborn...
