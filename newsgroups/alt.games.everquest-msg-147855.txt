He might not be able to swim down and loot without drowning, but he should
be able to drag it OK.  If there is a vertical limit on /corpse, it is
larger than the depth of the ocean.

Here's what I would try:

    1. Make a "/corpse" hotkey.

    2. Get on the boat, and target yourself.

    3. As the boat gets near the zone, start hitting your /corpse hotkey.

    4. As soon as you see the message that you've summoned the corpse,
    instead of the message that it is too far away, jump off the boat, and
    hit your /corpse key again, to make sure the corpse is still with you,
    and not on the boat again.

    5. Try typing /loot, or whatever the command is to start looting, and
    see if that works.  If it does, you might be able to loot while slowly
    sinking, and get everything before you start to drown.

    6. If /loot doesn't work, you can just swim on the surface to the
    nearest island, using /corpse frequently as you go to drag the corpse to
    the island.
