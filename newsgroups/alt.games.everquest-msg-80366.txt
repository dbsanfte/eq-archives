Sure.  That would be everything from "So was he a really good chess
player..." up to and including "whatta maroon)."  Glad to help.

Your apology is accepted.  Now, fuck off, please.  Thanks awfully.

Yet here you are.  I personally don't give a rat's ass about trimming
headers when responding to some moron (such as your own humble self, for
example), but I rather thought that chess weenies would have a lot more
class, or at least better sense.  Therefore, you're an anomaly.  I like
anomalies.  They're fun to fuck with, not to mention which I'm curious why
your mommy hasn't kicked your butt for crossing the street by yourself.
So, then, what's your excuse, or do you just LIKE living dangerously?

Only EVERYthing.  I don't think racism had anything to do with it.  I think
he probably just didn' t like lawyers.  That's an affirmative defense to
prosecution in most states.

Fuckin'-A, not to mention which our beer is colder, our wimmin hotter, and
we get to stay up late any time we want.

So, then, pawn-boy, shall we get serious, or would you prefer to simply
piss off to your own group and leave us alone before you get in over your
head?

(Side Note:  Y'all are witnesses!  Have I not given him a chance to back
up?  Huh?  Haven't I?  Right.  I don't want to hear any whining later.)
