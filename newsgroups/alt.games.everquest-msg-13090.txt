Come now. There was NO good reason to be starting this thread. Nothing
productive. If you have the commen sense of a bowl of tapioca, you
would have KNOWN that this would start an argument. Nothing more. And
that is EXACTLY why you did it. Don't think for one second you're
fooling anyone, child, because you're not.

Yes, it was. That doesn't mean it's popular there. WHERE it came from
is irrelevant.
