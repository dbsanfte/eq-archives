Ok, I'm still assuming there's people beta testing this that read this
newgroup...(And maybe there's a NDA or something that stops them from
answering questions) ANYWAY....

What the heck does the GUI look like?? Does any one know? Is there a
screenshot of it somewhere?? I'd have to guess that since the current GUI is
so bad and not even finished, that it will be fully updated...I've heard it
is, but I'd like to see it....Or I can wait another week....just
wondering...
