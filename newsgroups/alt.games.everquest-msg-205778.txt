I never played "old school" D&D (I know some girls did, but not me....)  I
had a friend over to the house recently who loved D&D as a teenager, so I
showed him around EQ.  He was immediately drawn in.  (and now maybe he even
can play, since the Mac version is out.)  However, he mentioned that the one
thing he absolutely loved about D&D was that, because there was a live human
DM creating the world and it's reactions, you could do/try almost anything
without limitation.  This of course isn't the case with EQ so much.

What do you guys who've played both think?  Clearly MMORPGs are more like
this than "regular" computer games.  What computer game most closely matches
this feature of D&D?
