No clue on Rodcet.  Hope it's back up by the time I get home.  :)

Dex is what makes your chance of having a combat skill increase better. 
Don't bother with +dex armor that isn't good armor otherwise, though.  It's
a waste.  Just ask a shaman for a dex buff whenever you want to work on a
lagging skill.
