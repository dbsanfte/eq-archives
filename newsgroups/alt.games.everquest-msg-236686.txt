I generally shy away from religion, I like to consider my self a non
believer in gods and deities, not to say im not open to the idea, but if
someone wants to tell me the lord or any other god exists, they need more
proof than some stories in a book written some hundreds maybe thousands of
years ago.  We used to do this thing in high school where 4 people would go
sit in the hall where they couldn't hear the class and one would come in and
tell and tell us a story from a paper the teacher gave her, then they call
in the next and the 2nd person doesnt get to see the store they have to hear
the story from the first person and so on.  Needless to say by the time the
forth person told us the story it wasn't the same story.  That was just a
few paragraphs and 4 people, try to imagine how much the bible then has
changed.  Hell you can't even go out and by one w/o seeing 50 diff bibles to
choose from.
