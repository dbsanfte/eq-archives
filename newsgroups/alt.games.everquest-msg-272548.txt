Aside from my cleric, my characters have never gone to PoK for buffs.  My 
cleric goes go PoK for kei only if I know there won't be a chanter in my 
group to give me clarity or whatever she can cast.  I let whatever group I'm 
in give me the buffs that are available.  That's the way it was before PoK 
and Luclin and I'm still used to playing without half a dozen uber buffs, 
and I think I do pretty well.
