I disagree.   A 60 cleric on Prexus firstly stole a guildies AoN a few
months back (he would let people try it on, who asked to use it.. too nice
for his own good

Then when we killed Lodi, he ninjad the shield piece.

A 60 SK jacked some plate pants on a kael arena I lead once (lots of people
have similar experiences with him too).. on a recent Tormax killing (a week
after somebody ninjad our Tormy crown) he showed up.

A guildie wizard grouped and decessioned him (single target succor), and
told him not to bother coming back.. AND a gm enforced it (he was told he
COULDNT go near our raid)

Thats 2 level 60 worthless fucks on Prexus... I can think of more
