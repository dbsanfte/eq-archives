Nonsense, you only say that, because nobody has.

Seriously, you attach much importance to the definition of evil.  It's not
quite that easy, since it is an abstract term, to a large extent, and it's
kind of fuzzy around the edges.  I still don't see how that proves that it
doesn't exist.  I see it as more of a failing on our parts to understand it.
