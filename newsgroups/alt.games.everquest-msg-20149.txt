Actually, if you could d/l the full game from somewhere (or someone copied
for you) then you'd not really be breaking the law, the game is of no use
copied as an account key is required. Of course that means you won't be able
to d/l because why would anyone put a game up for d/l that isn't usable?

If you have no friends that can copy their CD for you then looks like you
are going to have to buy it again, as DT said. I can't see anyone copying
theirs and shipping it to you, sorry an' all.
