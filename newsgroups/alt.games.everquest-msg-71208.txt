I pulled the UNIVAC out of the closet... well, OK, I opened the door to the
building it's in.  With me and 50 people doing the hard wiring and 20 more
replacing the vacuum tubes as they blow, I'm ALMOST able to get through the
patch screen.  A few more people and maybe I'll do it.  Friend of mine got
SoL running on the Commodore he has, though, so maybe there is hope.

lol
