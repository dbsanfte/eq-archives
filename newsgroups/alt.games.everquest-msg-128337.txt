First off, I must kill Rancerous Ghasts in Lesser Faydark in order to get 
four putrescent hearts. I have killed three ghasts and gained one heart so 
far, but it's been a few days. What's the best way to find the ghasts and 
is there any way to have them spawn more? I had read that they only wander 
between midnight and 6am, but I found one during midday wandering around. 
I also heard that killing other undead helps to trigger ghasts showing up, 
but I'm not sure of the truthfulness of that.

Second question, is mouse3 a usable button in EQ? Mouse4? Mouse5? If so, 
can specific buttons be assigned to commands via the command line or only 
through the options menu? I'm used to games like Half-Life where I can 
just use the bind command to put anything I want anywhere I want, I assume 
EQ has not such an ability?

Thank you.
