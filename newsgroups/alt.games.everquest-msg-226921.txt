I get what you're saying, and it's all quite impressive and very
educational and all, but it doesn't change the fact that if you roll
badly, it's not because you are "bad" at it. That would imply that it
had something to do with you in particular that is different from
someone who is a "good randomer". That's like saying something smells
white. 

It's chance. Not some kind of measurable ability.
