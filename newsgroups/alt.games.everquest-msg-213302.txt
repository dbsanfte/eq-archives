This is really amazing to me how polarized people are on this and, I
believe, not listening to what the others are saying.

1. No one believes she is innocent.
2. No one believes we are going to make cars foolproof.

Again, my point was that it wouldn't have to cost " $5 or 10 thousand
dollars" to remedy this problem.  If it added 200.00 to the price of a car I
would be surprised.  Ya gotta think it's probably not the best thing for the
seats, cd's, etc... for the temps to get that high either.  Just random
thoughts, maybe it wouldn't make enough of a difference in the temp?
