Well, you can kill an orc centurian with one shot right now. I did it
with about 10 skill in archery when I got my first good bow.

But! I imagine you are hoping for better than orc centurians.

A L60+ ranger using any high end (30+ damage) with AM3 and EQ (so they
can use the best arrows) can crit (probably using truestrike) on an
engaged mob (doubledamage if its stationary but not rooted) for over
3000 on extremely rare occasions. Crits for over 1000 will be only
uncommon, and crits above 500 will happen frequently (even without
truestrike).

Over a long fight the AM3/EQ ranger is THE highest damage dealer in
the game. Better than rogues, wizards, you name it. It's not even
close.

The nerf cry comes because unlike casters, rangers can keep this up
forever, and unlike melee they aren't getting hit back. However I hope
they leave it alone. It's such a sweet thing for poor downtrodden
rangers to finally have.
