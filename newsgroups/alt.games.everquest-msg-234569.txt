Hi i sure do hope that someone knows whats going on just 3 or 4 days
ago i was playing eq fine but for the last few days every time i try
to play eq everything lags badly.

The patch loads fine and everything is ok on the connect screen,i
enter my password and then click connect this is where everything
slows down.
It takes a few minutes to get to the server selection screen the mouse
is lagging 5 to 10 secs all time i cant even use the chat it is the
same thing everything is lagging even the tech support scroll text
lags as it goes across between 5 and 10 seconds.
If i try to enter world it crashes eq and says not responding does
anyone know whats going on i have made sure i have all new direct x
and graphics drivers and there are no problems or conflicts that i can
see please help im desperate.

Grant
