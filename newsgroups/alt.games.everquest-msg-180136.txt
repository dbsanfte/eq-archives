Before he starts to run, snare him.  When a MOB is below about 20
percent health (1 blue) and if they decide to run (some don't but most
do) they will turn and stop attacking but they may as well be rooted
because they don't move.  If they are rooted, however, they will
attack you if you get within melee range.  (Or cast on you if they
can)

Right now your dual wield is capped at skill level 100.  So you should
indeed be able to improve on it.  Perhaps you are fighting with two
handed weapons a lot?  Or doing a lot of your damage with the bow?  Do
you still equip a shield sometimes?

Depends on the weapon but most likely...

Better arrows, better bow, ding another level.

Soloing with the bow as your primary damage dealer is nearly
impossible at your level.  Just keep your archery skill up and
concentrate on melee.

If you really like to solo, you get a great spell at level 22: panic
animal.  With this you can snare an animal (tigers, snakes, griffons,
etc...) and then cause them to run away, very slowly, while you whack
them on the backside.  You end up taking little or no damage.  This is
the *best* and sometimes *only* way many rangers can find to solo.

Dexterity affects how likely you are to get a hit with the bow.  This
is *probably* also true for bow criticals.  In any case, if you really
want to be an archer, dexterity is your friend.  It helps you fletch,
shoot, improve your weapons skills faster, and helps weapons to proc
(do their special ability).

Are you taking bags and bags full of shafts, nocks, heads, and
fletches?  That is really your only option until you can get (and
use...it's level restricted) a Tolan's bracer.

> With kick, is there anyway to increase the damage that it does ?

I have never seen anything that will do this, aside from one or two
items that give you a "skill mod" to your kick ability.  The increase
in damage for these, I assume, isn't very important.  A lot of the
time I don't even bother pressing the kick button because I am too
busy with other things.  Because of the low damage it does, I find
that it's easily sacrificed when I am trying to also keep an add or
two rooted, keep two DOTs up, keep the MOB feared, switch weapons in
and out, etc,...

Take home message is, no, but don't worry about it.  You aren't a
monk.

> Can
> you get magical boots that add to damage ?

Yes and no, mostly no.  This brings up a point though.  You can't kick
any magical beings (such as a willow wisp) at all unless you are
wearing magic boots.  (And you can't slash without magical weapons) 
You may already know this but I learned the hard way when I tried to
slash and kick a will o wisp and found out the hard way that I only
managed to make it angry with me.
