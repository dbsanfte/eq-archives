Out of curiosity, how do you think these people would have maxed their INT?

My guess, and it's just a guess here, is that they did so by equipping gear
that has +INT.

So now they replace that gear, which has +INT, with the new gear, which does
not have +INT.

Do that in enough slots, ta-da, INT no longer maxed!

The new gear has to have at least as much INT as the old gear, and following
the trend exhibited by these items, it won't come close (since 0 INT is
almost certainly less that whatever Uberguilder_01 was wearing).
