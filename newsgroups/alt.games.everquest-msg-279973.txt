EQ isn't that hard. And I wouldn't go with boring either. It certainly 
gives you all the tools to hang yourself with. (Falling into the Hole 
Dragons, Werewolves, and Giants in zones with much lower level content, 
seemingly random npc faction related aggro as you pass huts, or 
villages, npcs just standing by a tree... runners causing swarms of 
adds, etc... 

EQ will kill your character often with little warning or hope of escape 
until you've really learned the ropes.

EQ is also more tedious. It takes long camps to get drops. It requires 
long xp grinds to level up.

But the random deaths keep it from getting too boring. ;)

Frustrating more than hard or boring.

The power-levelling alts of old-timers know whats the best xp/hour and 
that's all they care about. They won't move much, the rest of the herd 
follows them... few have the inclination to go anywhere outside the box.

I guess its hard for many people to justify leaving a safe, simple, 
recognized 'best xp' camp to go somewhere that's suboptimal at the best 
of times and will likely as not get you slaughtered ...owing to lack of 
knowledge about the layout pathing mob capabilites etc... not to mention 
the aforementioned wandering dragons, murderous npcs, and gaping holes 
in the ground... it takes a true adventurer. :)

Both however are growing.

As before both however are growing. :)

It seems to be dieing in fits and spurts more than slow and gradual. 
Each new mmorpg bites off a chunk. And it doesn't appear that EQ is 
attracting new players anymore in remotely significant numbers.
