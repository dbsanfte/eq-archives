I tried to use the underwater tunnel by the bank in South Qeynos today after
the patch to get to the Qeynos catacombs. You can still go down the shaft
but then it bottoms out with no way out but back up. Someone else tried it
and died. He also said it use to be there. I petitioned the gm and his reply
was that they have added a few quests in the last three patches to the area
but nothing physically had been changed.
Am I missing something here? I created a character to check it out before
the patch and it was there and now when I tried with my enchanter so I could
do the Lucia's dress, it's closer to Cuburt I need to kill, it doesn't seem
to be there.
