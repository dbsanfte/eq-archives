Heh, guess I'm still clinging to my Freeport faction. :) Those guards in HK
sure don't like me.  They sure are a nice steady source of pet weapons
though.  Just wish the merchants would buy from me so I wouldn't go
encumbered so quickly.  I'm definately a money whore. :D

I've mostly been avoiding the Planes because I've yet to develop a taste for
agro kiting.  I definately like the fact that I've gone 53 levels on pure
fear kiting.  That and stuff in PoN or PoD likes to resist snares and make
necromancer parts out of me.
