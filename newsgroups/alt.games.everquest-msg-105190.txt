After reading the patch message for yesterday I was curious to see the
changes in Misty Thicket.  For some reason I had my 13th level barbarian
shaman parked in Rivervale and decided to take her out to Misty to check
things out.  Misty now has a new Orc camp along the East wall (I think-when
you enter the gate turn right) There are about 6 orcs there that at level 13
were all dark and light blue.  Looks like a nice new spot for those levels.
YEAH!
