Since the last couple patches, Tarre (Tiru's 29 necro) has been
reporting to me that it only takes one bone chip to cast her pet. In
case it was a mistake, she checked before and after casting on several
occasions, including last night. Seems to be one bone chip instead of
two. Was this a publicly announced "anti-nerf" that I just missed? A bug
that she's benefitting from exclusively? Just a fact of life? Anyone
else seen this?
