Here speaking for the family Bard.

Bards used to be allowed to train in Pick Lock at level 40.  Now young Bards 
automatically train in the skill at level 10.  As our level was between 
those two levels, it did not come to our attention until one of the Newbies 
mentioned it.  So, off went the Bard to practice.

He stationed himself underwater in Paineel at the rock leading to The Hole. 
And now his skill is 117, which seems to be the trivial on that lock.

He cannot find the correct door upon which to practice in Befallen... Down 
the broad steps he went and to the left there is a door with a keyhole.  But 
the door opens without a key and without a lockpick...
He does not know where to go in Befallen.

In East Freeport he went to the shop named Hallard's Resales, down two sets 
of steps into the basement and found the locked door.  This one, just as the 
locked door in the North Freeport bank, will not allow practice.  His skill 
is insuffient.

Player level is 39.  Where to go now?  What to do to increase skill?
