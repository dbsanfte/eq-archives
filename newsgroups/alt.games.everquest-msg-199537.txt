"Ancient Destruction of Ice" is the best wizard nuke in game and that is not
a PoP spell. So there are no PoP spell upgrades. Take a look yourself again
if you don't believe me. Our rain spells are upgraded though, but thats
laughable.
I find it strange that wizards dont get any upgrades in the fields wizards
are supposed to be master at, whilst all other classes did get upgrades in
their speciality fields? What gives?
Lets not mention the LoY spells.... our mega uber vision buff spell....
LMFAO!!!!!!! :-)
I think the designer of wizard spells only got his job because he was cheap
and came straight out from rehab.

I've actually seen people laugh at the PoP spells that wizards get.. they
also comment on how few spells wizards get in PoP. It's hilarious. This
isn't only a mindless rant, most people say wizards got the short end of the
stick in PoP.
