True, but my part of it isn't.

And I'm not prepared to just import some excess population from a 3rd 
world country that is having them at irresponsible rates.

Besides I think think the local culture is worth preserving. And on a 
philosophical level, survival of the fittest requires that we have children.

At this point in history, we may have an unique (amongst the species) 
'evolution' taking place, where the least successful members of 
population are the most likely to reproduce. Essentially, globally, (and 
even within North America/Europe and the rest of the 1st world) the 
least viable, least educated, least successful people have the vast 
majority of the kids.

Long term, what might that be doing to the human race? Or more 
clinically what traits are we breeding for now?
