These aren't actually newbies.  They are snot nosed 12 year olds who feel
they're entitled to free handouts.  They make lower level chars and play the
'underpriveleged newbie' role and pester everyone with tells for cash and
gear.  These chars are usually female barbs or half elves with names like
Juggz and Spankme.  Sadly, some people will give it to them, which is why
they keep doing it.

I was changing some stuff around between a few chars at PoK bank awhile back
and I got begging tells from the same person on each of the 3 chars pretty
much as I logged in. Then the same character bought a 5kpp item from my
trader that afternoon.

Personally, I tell the beggars to screw off.  If there's a newbie asking
questions and being curious about the game, I'll help them with info and
usually give them some gear.
