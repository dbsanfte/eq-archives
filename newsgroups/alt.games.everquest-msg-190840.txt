Any group worth it's salt could deal with a Tank not having a clue...at 40th
level it's not a case of "everyone must know their job or we die" and with
100k (at 40th) of equipment he won't *need* to taunt, he should be doing
enough damage to hold aggro anyway. On top of this I have seen enough
clueless 40th + level characters in DL who haven't spent a penny of RL cash
on their character but still have no idea what /assist does, why not to
break mez, or what a Rogue can bring to a group.

My friend Returned to the game after losing interest with DAoC. Having sold
last character on PA he started from scratch...too slow he thought, bought
some PP...bought some more PP...Bought a 60th level Cleric (no
epic)..and...bought some more PP (fuck knows how much he spent /boggle)
anyway the cleric was never used, he instead equipped a 40th Druid on the
account and used it to P/L a Warrior/monk and various other characters.
Eventually he got bored and quit...sold Cleric account and I sold his
equipment then gave him the plat which he  sold for cash. Every time he sold
the plat (bundles of 50k) I asked who to (nosey bastard that I am) and every
time it was a high level (55- low 60's) in a fairly established Guild. The
cleric account was sold to 56th Warrior and I have since seen it used (not
played) as a buff bot.
So in my experience buyers are not new players with no clue who just buy
plat, buy equipment (or, in fact, whole characters) and then run around
getting groups killed. They are experienced players with (a very) disposable
income (in my friends case, a lot of it...although he got much of what he
spent back, I am certain it was still at a loss) if you have a problem with
them cheating, well they are only cheating themselves, unless of course you
play on a PvP server, in which case you may have a point. Their having
better equipment than you does not mean they are going to get into groups
you are after, when LFG it does not provide a magelo profile of you. The
equipment that drops and can be bought is inferior to the No Drop items of a
similar level and these days the better items (that do drop) are all level
limited anyway.
If people want to spend their real cash on the game, fine...They take the
very real (imo) risk of getting scammed. It certainly has no effect on me or
my game and I certainly don't view the people who paid cash to my friend for
plat with any envy or consider them cheats.

The only valid complaint I can really see of this, in it effecting others,
is the farming of items to make the cash. This DOES effect other people as
they find that zones/mobs they want are taken by people after the item to
sell for plat to sell of cash.
But then farmers have always had that effect on the game, whether or not
they are camping the spawn/area for plat or for dollars.
