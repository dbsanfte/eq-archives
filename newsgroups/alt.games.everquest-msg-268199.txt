Not really, you should have the cash to buy things you need since you are 
concentrating on leveling. I don't do any tradeskilling, but I do harvest 
everything I can, and vendor it in the evening. So far made about 70s at 
level 12 from doing this so working out for me. I did raise my tradeskills 
to level 9 so I could make the boxes for my bank so I dont have to buy bags 
for there, took me just over 2 hours to do this. (used the speed method 
found on another board)
