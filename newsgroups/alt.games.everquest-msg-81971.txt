It was a bunk post because wizards rock. The problem with wizards is
all the unimaginative players who insist the only way to play is to
kill one mob at a time with excessive melee power. Dull dull dull.

The wizard way to play is to vaporize multiple mobs at one time and
watch the experience fly.

And by the way, NO PORTS FOR YOU!!!!
