Next question is, how should this be handled?  I put my foot in my mouth in
regards to actually posting them.  It would be a HUGE post, for a non binary
newsgroup anyway.  Hmm.  Tell ya what.  Click on the link below to download
them.  Due to bandwidth limitations I will keep it up for no longer than 48
hours.  (starting on July 26, 2001 at 1300 EST)

http://www.asagorder.org/Guide_Package.zip

The above includes the actual guide that guide's are to use when handling
situations (along with common sense) and I believe a little petition queue
preparation program, to show and demonstrate how to use the queue system.  I
am posting this for many reasons:

1.  It was requested ;)
2.  Perhaps now those not aware of what guides must follow, will now learn
what they can and cant do as per VI.
3. Those interested in becomming guides can see just how much help they will
be able to offer those in game, incase they are wishing to join the program
hoping to make a contribution.
4.  Because frankly, I've yet to see this information made available
anywhere else.

Please note, I am not aware of any copyright conflictions or infringements
caused by making this available.  Should this post be in violation to any or
all EULA and/or Copyrights held by VI or anyone else for that matter, please
contact me via reply email so that I may make the file unavailable for
download immediately.
