I'm sorry to say that my first impulse when seeing this wasn't 
necessarily all that enlightened.

If the selling of accounts is legalized, then if it damages the game 
enough for me to want to leave, at least I've got a legal way to cash in 
on my accounts.

If selling of accounts isn't legalized, and therefore the game isn't 
ruined (by that particular means, that is), then I get to keep playing.

Win Win.

Course that doesn't necessarily address potential damage to the genre as 
a whole by encouraging this sort of idea in the minds of the other bean 
counters in the other companies.
