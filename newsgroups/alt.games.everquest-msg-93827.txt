I've lost your original post, was it 1300 or 1400 ac you said you were at
when buffed?

I was comparing with some guildie monks last night... and im really curious
what gear you have that gives you such high ac (as you said yourself you
don't have anything from ToV)

Could you post your gear/link me to your magelo profile please?
