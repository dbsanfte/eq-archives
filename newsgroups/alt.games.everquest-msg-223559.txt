Guys EQ is not a solo friendly game. If thats what you want then look
elsewhere. Im no fan of EQ but they have all but printed MADE FOR
GROUPING ONLY on the freakin boxes. It sucks I know but there it is.
Besides it isnt like EQ is the only game in town and some of them are
VERY solo friendly so take a look around ya might find what you like.
