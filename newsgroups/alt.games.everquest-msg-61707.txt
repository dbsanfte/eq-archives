Personally, I say no. There's no rule whatsoever about killing guards.
Bankers, yes - guards, no.

More often than not, in the semi-newbie zones (East Commons, a chunk of
Butcherblock, etc), the guards are KSers, rather than protectors. I'm sort
of of the mind that younger players (the true newbies, who actually want to
experience the "newness" of EQ) learn better when put to the test. People
removing the guards for XP means that the guard in that area isn't there for
the newbie to run to when he/she gets in trouble. When you're a new player,
sure, dying sucks, but it's very rarely more than a 5 minute run away. Folks
who act as replacement guards are going above and beyond what they're
required to do by EQ-etiquette, imo.

Fact is, there's no guards to protect you as you get higher in level - get
used to it now. =)
