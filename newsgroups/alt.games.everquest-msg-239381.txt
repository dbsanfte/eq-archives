Yeah...I was aware it wasn't locally considered 'the south' despite
sharing a border with mexico. 

I'd always figured the border to 'the south' was a cultural difference
more than a political or geographical one myself... though I guess
Civil War allegiances probably reflect those cultural differences
pretty well.

Still ... I rather like lumping Cali in with 'the South'... they get
so damned irritated by it...can't imagine why... 8p

It makes up for American tourists in Toronto particularly southern
ones... (including Californians) examining the bus & subway schedule
and finally asking which bus takes you to Vancouver.

Um... Greyhound... should only take you 5 or 6 days.
