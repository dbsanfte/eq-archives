The Old Testament laws in Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy applied to the
covenant community of God's people prior to the coming of Christ..... they
were rules that were to be enforced (but if you read the Old Testament
histories, they weren't very often) upon those who were part of God's
people.

Therefore, one was not supposed to claim to be part of God's people and at
the same time be a practicing sorcerer, idolater, etc.  The penalty was to
be 'cut off from the people.'  In these cases, usually the death penalty.
The ancient world was a harsh world.  We are very naive if we
self-righteously judge it by today's politically correct standards.

In the New Testament, similar behavior standards for God's people apply.
(God's character has not changed, so what pleases/displeases Him is the
same.)  One is not supposed to claim to be a Christian and practice sorcery,
idol worship, etc.  The penalty in the New Testament is to be cut off from
God's people -- but in the case of the New Testament, it is excommunication
(if the church member refuses to repent), with a view that the person could
possibly be won back.

Christ did not change what is acceptable behavior among God's people... He
changed how the penalties would be handled.  We are warned by Christ not to
take up the sword as a means of handling matters in the church.  When the
church has taken up the sword (i.e., the Crusades), it turned out very badly
for everyone involved.

The problem in American Christianity is that many try to apply the rules of
behavior for the believing community to non-Christians and others outside
the community of believers..  Let's take the case of a Pagan.  Is the Pagan
a Christian?  No.  If they are not a professing member of a Christian
church, then what penalty should the Pagan face at the hands of the church?
None, because they are not under the jurisdiction of the God's people.  (The
Pagan is still answerable to God, however.)  The church could urge the Pagan
to repent and become a Christian, but that's about it.

Otherwise, we are under the commandment to look out for what's best for our
neighbor, no matter who or what they are, because all of mankind is made in
God's image, even if they are in rebellion against Him.

However, if said Pagan is a full-fledged practicing Pagan, AND also claims
to be a full fledged member in good standing at his local evangelical
church, and refuses to leave one side or the other, then the local church is
to help that person decide which way they are going to go, and keep that
person's double-mindedness or hypocrisy from infecting the church.

See I Corinthians 5 : 9-13.  In verse 12 of that passage the Apostle Paul
says, "For what have I to do with judging outsiders?  Is it not those inside
the church you are to judge?  God judges those outside."  In otherwords, the
church is to clean up it's own act, and leave the judging of those outside
the church to God.  It's similar to to Jesus' commandment to take the log
out of our own eye before we criticize our neighbor for the speck of sawdust
in his eye.

(the context of  I Corinthians chapter 5 was a case of an incestuous sexual
relationship in a local congregation that was causing a scandal in the
town...even the local pagans knew that what that church was allowing at the
time was wrong, and Paul was instructing them to clean up their own house.
Sounds a little similar to a certain modern case, doesn't it? )
