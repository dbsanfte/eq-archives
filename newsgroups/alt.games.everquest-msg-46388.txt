Well, for the endgame, its mages hands down.  Mages nukes are resisted
and mages can't take pets on most raids.

The only reason to want a 55+ mage is CoH. 

Mages are great damage dealers up to the 50s, then become increasingly
useless.  At 55+ they find they can't solo anymore, but no one wants
them in a group except for CoH.  Most mages leave the game at that
point and start working on alts.
