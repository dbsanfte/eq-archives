On a massively multiplayer game? Were not talking Muds here especially
free ones. The clientele is different. The earliest MMORPG I was in
was UO, I know there was one called the Realm and another called
meridian something or other. Neverwinter Nights also. Those are the
types of games were talking about and I kind of doubt every possible
solution has been tried in the 10 or so of them that have existed
ever.

That's why you have NPC's to do it for you. Like in Shadowbane.

The Anti Pk's hunt where the Pks hunt. In UO the Pk's could move on a
moments notice to escape. They had the mobility advantage. There were
no counter advantages for the good guys. 

Remove recall from the equation. Add factions which can be adjusted by
pking. Add those factions to NPC town guards who can be set to kill on
sight players by name. Add the need to go to those towns or others
like them.  Has this been tried anywhere? It will be this summer in
Shadowbane and I am interested in seeing how it turns out. 

If it doesn;t work take what failed and modify it to work more
efficiently. The goal is not 100% the goal is to make it so only the
most dedicated pkers can do it. The goal is to make pking viable but
only with consequences.

And in EQ all you have is a highly sophisticated game of Duck hunt.
And? FPS are a very popular genre, adapting them to a stategy/rpg
market could be a huge success if done right.

Well I am assuming either a strict Realm based switch like DAoC to
avoid team griefing or a hopefully strong
faction/geographical/resource system like Shadowbane. 
Again, step out of the box your in and recognize that some people have
no problem with PvP itself only with unrestricted Pking with no
recourse to avoid it. If you can do that you could see that a virtual
world which had enough built in deterrents to rampant pking could
provide both the potential for Pvp in a team based setting,  and
enough security that your team mates are on your side that you could
enjoy the non pvp aspects as well.
