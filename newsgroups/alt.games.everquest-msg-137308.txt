Way back when, my original cleric was a smith.  And we didn't have
stackable plates like you younguns do.  She'd buy material
in HHK filling her slots up to capacity, then gate to the forge in Freeport
near the bank and work.  She'd also stuff the bank account full
before leaving since it was such a long run back to HHK.

To move from vendor to bank, and from bank to forge, she
had to cast both Yaulp (short term str boost) and reckless
strength (another short term one, this one starts out high and
gradually falls till your str is far lower than start, when it
finally wears off) and then waddle as fast as managable the
30 feet or so from one spot to the other... "as fast as managable"
slowly going from waddle to step..... step...........step........stuck.

Fun
