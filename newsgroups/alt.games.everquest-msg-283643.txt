I think you have the logic wrong.

Three possible cases

Combine is ahead of Sleeper.  Result, Sleeper merges into Combine.

Sleeper is ahead of Combine.  Result, Combine merges into Sleeper.

Both are the same.  Result, Sleeper merges into Combine.

While its possible that you'll have to merge, playing on Combine won't 
protect you from that if your server is behind.  There is the 
possibility of "loss of face" if both servers are equal and yet 
participation is too low to sustain two servers; that will favor Combine.

By the way, I'd wager heavily in favor of that happening, for the most 
part, people tend to go back to their existing high level characters 
after flirting with the new ones, and on the other hand, it doesn't seem 
to me that what is required to unlock the first few servers is all that 
arduous, so its likely that both servers will be unlocked as soon as the 
time limit per expansion is hit.  Odds of one or the other being ahead 
when they decide to pull one of the two plugs doesn't seem to me to be 
all that high.
