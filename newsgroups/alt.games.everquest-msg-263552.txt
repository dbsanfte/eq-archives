Send me your beta information I would like to check it out and send feedback 
to Sony, but I did not get in the beta...... I am a software developer as 
well, have beta'ed most of the other games in this arena (and played most of 
them out of beta, always wonder how they pick people when more people 
complain here than send feedback to them with bug reports etc). I understand 
that beta in these things is completely different from a business 
application.

remove underscore news to send me a respons with the info. I somehow doubt 
it will happen, but since you are not playing and hate it so much figured it 
is worht a shot, heck you have access to 12 accounts not being played, maybe 
someone will send me the info...............
