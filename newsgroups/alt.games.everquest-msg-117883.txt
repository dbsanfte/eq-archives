Kelethin (or maybe kaladim). I like to move to butcherblock about level 4
and hunt around the GF zone. Loot isnt spectacular, but theres plenty of
easy, non-agro-, non-social monsters. At about level 6 I like to kill the
dwarf skeletons around the druid ring and tower. There are 8 spawns total,
only 2 of which are in agro range of one another. These give reasonable loot
for newbies, and of course give bone chips for either selling or questing
(one in kaladim).

Misty was nice, but too crowded when I tried it. I think just about every
race brought their twink to riverdale.
