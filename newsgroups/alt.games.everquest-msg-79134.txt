Someone mentioned a rumor today about "final damage" dealt by a weapon plays
a part in determining who gets experience and how much. (false)


Tradeskills:

Medding while doing combines increases chances of skill-ups or successes (false)

Increased STR helps increase chances for skill ups in smithing (maybe false -
some inside information has it that it helps only if STR exceeds 180-something)

Having eaten and drank recently increases chances for skill ups or successes (false)

(I've had people tell me these when I've been asked to make something for them.  Usually
I just thank them for the info, and do the thing they suggest to make them happy, since it
can't hurt.)
