I've fought at least a few dozen wurms in various zones without ever
noticing any targetting problem, so I'm wondering what it is?
And I can't recall any of the ordinary (non-named) wurms in BW ever
nuking.

Sure, slow sucks (tho not much concern to the OP's necro), but what
I've always hated most is a self-healing mob.  Especially back in
the good old days when available weapons did a whole lot less damage
than they do nowadays (a combine 2hs at 12/43 is pretty pathetic
compared to its "modern" equivalent: the BABS at 24/39) and so some
relatively weak mobs simply could not be killed by a solo melee.
