I just got back in about a month or 2 ago from playing back in 99-00 ( my 35
pally was still there!). It has changed a LOT, particularly with the new UI
and the planes of power addition, so I just bought Evolutions to give it a
go. The love is back! It seems much easier to level (at least, from what i
recall) now. MANY folks out there to help, but if you go back get on the
Stromm server, (or Firiona Vie is actually a neat experience, with the
forced RP elements).  You won't be disappointed.
