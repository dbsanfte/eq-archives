FYI:

Shift-Up Arrow: Brings up the last line you typed in.
Shift-Home: Puts the cursor at the start of the line.
Shift-Right Arrow: Moves the cursor to the right. Repeat as necessary.
Backspace: Rubs out the offending error. Repeat as necessary.

You don't HAVE to retype a long line, just fix it with these almost-
standard editing keys.

For completeness' sake:
                ^
                Good or bad use of apostrophe? I dunno!

Shift-Down Arrow: Pages down to a later line. The command history
is 20 lines or so, I think.
Shift-Left Arrow: Guess what this does!
Shift-End: Puts cursor at the end of the line.

Hmm, any I missed? Oh, here are some other neat keyboard shorcuts:
Shift-PgUp: Scrolls the message window upwards.
Shift-PgDn: Guess what this does!

Not that I mind the addition of /em, but from your post it seemed
like you weren't aware of at least some of these shortcuts...
