No DT, it's uncommon sense.  I've grouped with a couple Druids who
claimed to be getting fewer kills partnered with me than they did
solo, and frankly I believed them.  Solo Druids (usually) learn how
to use their mana effectively solo, and then they all to often try
to be a Cleric when partnered.  Druids are much better at killing
than they are at healing, and when partnering with a self healer
like my Paladin it is almost always far more effective to spend
your mana killing the mob, and maybe toss a heal at me after the
fight if it seems appropriate.  And that is only one example of a
grouping strategy, there are hundreds of other group compositions
that include a Druid, and a Druid has the spell selection to be
effective in pretty much any setting, if he can be bothered to
figure out what actually works well.  Sometimes ersatz Cleric <is>
the best approach, but not always nor even often, depending on the
folk you group with.  Druid is closer to Bard than any other caster
in this flexibility, but it's so damned easy to play and kill things
solo with a Druid that due to laziness or stupidity or perhaps both
there are an awful lot of Druids out there who are clueless when it
comes to being an effective group member.
