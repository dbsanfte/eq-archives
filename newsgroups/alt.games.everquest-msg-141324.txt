British Lit? Do you mean reading the same books as the ones we 'Brits' were
reading in the British equivalent of 9th grade? :o)

Well, I guess you'll get an F on that Lit course... you obviously don't have
sufficient language skills for it, or else you might have realised that the
word 'school' can be used to cover anything from pre-Kindergarten nurseries
thru to post-Doctoral research. Unless, of course, the course isn't about
exploration of the concepts and ideas expressed in the literature, but
merely a regurgitation of cliches and misconceptions peretuated by the
talentless educational dross that are now employed on the basis of the
'Humanities Minor' they took in College to avoid doing any real thinking?

I hate to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you ARE immature, kid... else
you wouldn't enter a dick waving contest like this without first knowing how
big the competition is. It's a big, bad world out here... and you're at the
age where you're about to discover you AREN'T immortal :o)
