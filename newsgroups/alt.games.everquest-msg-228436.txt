If this guild can raid the targets without the org, then it is time for
your guild to leave this alliance and raid them on your own, IMHO. Being
in an alliance when you don't need to be just holds you back. 

And even if you stayed in, who are they to dictate what you do on your
down days? If you have the force, you can do what you want. If they
don't like it, they are welcome to either stop inviting you to the
raids they hold (See my above viewpoint for how bad I think THAT would
be... :> ) or to try to race you on the off days, which I doubt will
happen since if they could get the force on those days, they would.
