That's right, it's not theft, it's just a violation of the EULA.
Though I admit I haven't specifically checked to see if the EULA
for the client software says that I'm not allowed to use it to
talk to something other than Sony's EQ servers.  So it's possible
that I could even use the Sony client for that purpose, though it
likely wouldn't work since Sony updates the client fairly often
and I'd be amazed if a private server could keep up with it.

No, the real crime here is being committed by whoever runs the
private server, since if it serves up content identical to some
or all of the contents of Sony's version of Norrath, the private
server is infringing on Sony's intellectual property (might be a
copyright violation, might be something else; IANAL).
