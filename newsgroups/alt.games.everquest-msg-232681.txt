My guild, NightWatcher (www.nwguild.com), is on The Seventh Hammer. 
We're CET based, raiding 7 days a week 8:30 CET.  Check out the boards
on the site, esp the recruitment forums.  We've just completed a big
round of backflagging so being EP flagged would be a big plus.  What
we're doing right now is working on Corinav and dipping toes in the
water of PoEb.  We farm Fennin now, have recently completed Xegony and
got Corinav to 86% before being TLed out (on our 3rd try)...he's gonna
fall soon hehe.

Drop by, post an app (include magelo and play times etc)...maybe see
you around
