Hi all
Over the years I have learned a lot from all of you.  Most of my
questions are answered b4 I get a chance to even ask.  I have a problem
that I cant seem to find a solution for, yes I have searched the
internet for the last 3 weeks, so I am hope to get some help/guidance
from all of you.

I play EQ.  When you have a buff on you and you put the mouse over the
buff it shows how much time is remaining on that buff.  Well when I do
it nothing pops up.  There is no information.  In fact all of the pop
up information is gone when I put my mouse over anything that use to
pop up information.  This started just after one of the patches in Dec.
(cant remember which one, early in the month).
Any ideas how to fix it.  Btw clicking (right and left) work fine.

Thanks
Lady of Old
