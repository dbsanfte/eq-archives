OK, OK, lets say one per 12 then.  Thats two minutes to rez raid instead
of one.

OK, 3 clerics.  About two and a half minutes to click rez 40 people.  Oooh.

Lets say worst case, one cleric 40 people.  400 seconds.  A little over 6
minutes.
Give him seven because he's having trouble finding that last unrezed body.

Now look at AE rez.  Dunno how this would work, but I'd guess it would
require people be in your group.  So you can rez 5 or perhaps 6 people (assuming

you are dead yourself) and then what?  Disband and join other groups to rez
them?  Bah.  Only if its like MGB would this spell make any sense at all.

One cleric in guild had stick prior to the change.  And she only got
it about a week before change.  Now we have six epic clerics, and the
couple who don't have epic are the ones who never bothered starting
the quest.  There's no excuse now for not getting epics done, the quest
is really one of the easiest epic quests in the game, take a week or
so start to finish if you don't get stuck in a bottleneck somewhere (I
hear the hand in to get shimmering pearl is now a nuisance.

At this point, I'm seriously considering getting my shimmering pearl again
so we can trigger Ragefire to farm for his other drops.  Since there's
only a 20 minute wait for the trigger to repop, this wouldn't seriously
interfere with clerics getting their epics.
