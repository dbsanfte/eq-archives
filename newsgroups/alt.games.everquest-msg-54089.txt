Rest of stuff cut. Yeah, this is happening because you are level 29
though. What you find out in about 4 levels, well, at level 34 or 35
to be precise, is that its better for you to sit your bum down in
front of kaladim and do the 2 sensible shoed dwarf axe ladies on
kaladim citizen (faction that only they have, so a throw away) by
starting off splitting them with harmony. After they die, they always
drop plat and at least one 5 plat axe you sell to the dwarf vendor in
that hut if both are dead or the one next door. You end up making far
more than you would getting 25 plat for a port while also getting
about the best xp in the game for you as a druid up until level 44 or
so.

What was great was before they nerfed them and I found that spot no
one else did cause you had to start it with harmony. At that time the
axes sold for 24 plat to the npcs. So i started doing them there at 34
and made thousands of plat in no time. That was before snare and root
stacked, now it would be way easier.

My point is that all too soon your time is just better spent where you
are making equal or greater xp and money than getting piddly port
donations even if they are as much as 50 plat. Its pretty much great
RIGHT at 29 and a couple levels but thats about it. When you get to
level 50 plus its not worth it to stop what you are doing to port
someone for 100 - 500 plat most of the time.
