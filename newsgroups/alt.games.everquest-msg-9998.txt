Rxxxxx bxxxxxxx, a person that appears to be
posting from a syncata location is using profanities
and is disrupting a newsgroup on the internet. He is
also claiming to be the owner of Sxxxxx. He has had a
history of doing this and was fired from Txxx Wxxxxx
for doing this very same thing along with posting
pictures of himself using drugs. One time before he
claims to have gotten in trouble for tracking dwn
someone in real life from the internet and harrassing
them. He is doing this again at alt.games.everquest. I
have included some of his posting and I am also
contacting some people I know at Hxxxx to get down to
the bottom if this activity. I don't know if this is
the image that sxxxxx is attempting to portray to the
general public. You apparently have some renegade
employee that is using his work time to be on the
internet disrupting discussion groups instead of
working. If it becomes clear that Sxxxxxx in endorsing
the activities of Rxxxxx Bxxxxxx I will seek relief
directly with sxxxxxx and will ask honda to review
this relationship. Rxxxxxx bxxxxxx posts under the
name Brat on the internet.
