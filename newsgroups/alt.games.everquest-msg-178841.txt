Yeah zoning is a nightmare for me using two EQW (and I'm doing it on a
Celeron 500 with a Geforce 2 GTS). I usually get one character where I
want to be with only one window open, then bring the other one there.
But if I am porting myself around... yeesh.

I don't get a whole lot of video lag, nothing worth worrying about,
but I do notice some odd horizontal bars on my monitor while doing it.
Subtle but visible. Dunno what to think of that. :-)

I don't anticipate similar problems with a druid on backup.

I just went out and tried that (I will leave Martin's suggestion for
when I'm in a better zone), the animation thing I mean. It was more or
less able to kill everything I attacked without me doing much more
than my token dot damage. The shield of blades did the rest, and the
regrowth made sure the pet was almost constantly ready to go. It
killed about as fast as a charmed pet did without druid backup, so the
exp was about the same; on the other hand, it was a hell of a lot
SAFER. :-p So much safer I'd feel okay about doing it in a cramped
quarters dungeon like ToFS (casters may be a worry).

Still, I want to try charming in a better zone, perhaps BW, to see if
I can keep myself more or less safe while pulling with the druid using
a charmed pet. I think it might end up better. But at least I know
that at the very least, I can do what I have been doing with a pet
that won't ever turn on me. :-p

Btw what level do enchanter pets start dual wielding again... I've
forgotten.
