And this is even with tradeskills sucking ass and causing carpal
tunnel in EQ. If EQ has so many tradeskillers, how many more will be
in a game where the tradeskill system is GOOD, has a good reward to
investment ratio, etc.

In SWG you can BE only that if you want. You get more xp and skills
for it. It is INCENTIVE.

Yeah, really it makes sense. Like someone else said, everyone can't be
Luke. The world becomes more like a world when someone is the
equivilent of a jawa, dealing in junk or repaired items, while someone
else fixes blasters, someone else is a combat medic, etc. For example,
I like healing in games like EQ so I AM going to be a combat medic in
SWG. Some people want to be Jedis, screw that, the Jedis still need a
support system.

In the case of the SW mythos, I think the roles are more attractive.
Its not like if you had some real life MMORPG like "Movie Makers!"
where everyone would want to be producers and directors and no one
would want to be the best boy grip. In SWG even the medic or smith are
interesting game roles.
