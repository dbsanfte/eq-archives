Had some luck with finding Ldon groups the last weeks,or lets say with
building them myself.There are still some interesting items to have
for some classes,especially the Pet aug from North Ro,the FT augs,or 
the Bloodys Ancille Pouch (sp?) for summoning arrows.
Still by far the best expansion for me,I am anxious to see if SoE
manages it to kill Ldon finally with the next expansion.  :p
Maybe if they keep up with the nice itemization like this festive
doll, the +5 on all stats aug from a 45 mob in DS,conveniently 2 steps
away from PoK,or the 20m/20hp aug from the Qeynos mission.  *sigh*
