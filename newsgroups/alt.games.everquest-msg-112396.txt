Necros rock.  They can pump mana and do all sorts of helpful things aside,
they are masters of DoT and are able to do sacrificial res's if no cleric is
around (provided someone will die for you...test of true friendship there)
they can summon corpses with coffins which prevents huge nasty Cr's deep in
Seb or some other fun and thrilling place you may die...they have great
pets...the list goes on.  Splurt rocks...so many good things to say about
necs.  There are just too many to list.

You truly lose out on a very good grouping partner if you choose not to
group with necs because of one bad experience.

Every class can have crappy controllers...but that doesn't mean the class is
useless.
