Top posting is appropriate for short conversational threads where you
aren't going to go in on a point by point basis and reply to each in turn.
The comment they reply to is quoted in its entirety below, but all
visible on a single page along with your reply.

Even then quotes of quotes rapidly push past the acceptable one page
length

END OF TOP POST

With the new norm, we don't bottom post, nor top post.  We reply
selectively mid post to each new thought.  And we  SNIP out as much
as we can to shorten down to the train of thought we are replying to.

This practice would limit the usefulness of usenet and email to a letter
writing model.  Electronic posting with quotability means we can
"converse" point by point without having to refer back to this or
that, making it much easier to follow the discourse

BEGIN BOTTOM POST

See, writing down here and quoting you in full is almost more annoying
than top posting, I agree that if top or bottom were the only options, you
might have a point.  Bottom posting, though, means that when an old
thread pops up you at least have a chance of following it down in a logical
FIFO fashion.  Also, bottom posting is just an unsophisticated form of
linear response posting, and bottom posters tend to rapidly evolve into
the vastly superior fully interactive posters.  Top posters, on the other
hand, tend to entrench into their postions and fossilize there.

Worst of all would be a long thread with a mix of top, bottom, and
responsive posters.  While Bottom and Responsive aren't toooo
estranged from each other, top/bottom/top/responsive/botttom/top/
top/bottom.... well you see how this can get desperately out of hand.
this sequence would yield

7
4(5 responding inside 4)
2
1
3
6
8

so try to follow that!
