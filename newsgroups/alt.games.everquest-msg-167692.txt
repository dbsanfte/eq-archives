> Any tips on using Atone? I use it but perhaps you have some advice.

Pretty basic stuff, but here are some ideas:

Root, then heal/buff main tank or debuff mob, then atone the mob to 
avoid agro.

If you want to get rid of a mob, root, run out of agro range, and atone. 
  Watch the mob and sometimes it will turn away from you when atone 
takes.  You might need to atone multiple times to get it to forget you.

To get rid of sit agro from greens you don't want, just stand up and 
atone.

If you get an add on a pull and you're not KOS, kill one quick and atone 
the other.  This can be done where no other type of crowd control would 
work such as when the mob is too high level to land spells on.

When you see an unwanted train with stuff spread out, cast atone on the 
last mob to leave it behind.

If one person in a group needs to avoid a faction adjustment for a mob 
the group is killing, have that person stop attacking before the mob 
dies, and atone.

The time atone is really nice is when a big nasty mob agros someone and 
you heal/buff the person through several fights with other mobs.  I once 
figured out I had healed a total of over 9k on a tank that had something 
agroed (the mob was stuck somewhere with a pathing bug and finally 
popped to us).  Atone would have saved me if I had cast it before root 
wore off.

Haven't tried this, but I would think atone would be useful in raid 
situations to avoid people getting summoned, as long as you could keep 
the mob on the main tank.

This stuff works fine for enchanters with mem blur too of course.
