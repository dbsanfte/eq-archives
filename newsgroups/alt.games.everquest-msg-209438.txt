If I get ornate leather pants, they'll have right click root too :)

SoW from my woven grass boots: kick the recipient in the butt for a
speed boost.

Regen from my tunic... I guess rubbing my chest makes hearts race
faster (after all, I am a female wood elf, and it is a leather tunic)
Rubbing my current pants is so exhilarating it knocks me and my group
out of this world, eventually to resettle in Misty Thicket. Playing
with my ear ports us out of this world and takes us back down in
Dreadlands. 

On the other hand, I shake evil insects of my bracer, my scimitar, and
my tunic if I ever get a Kerasha tunic. And anyone I touch with my
gloves gets coated with thorns.

My old earring of woven grass would fascinate anyone who looked at it
to the point of them loosing their footing and thus walking slower
(snare). My earring of twisted leaves scared people into temporarily
running faster, or was that an increased heart rate thing like the
tunic? (Scale of wolf)
