Hey, for christmas i got a Gefroce 3 (Woo Hoo) but it has problems with
Everquest, (I cant camp past character screen without computer locking, and
cant zone. When i zone i think the enteringworld app stops responding, and I
have to alt tab out of EQ) So i thought i would Put my Voodoo 5 back in and
order a new computer with a Geforce 3 (i have to much money on my hands).
Well, now the Voodoo 5 is doing the same thing in EQ as the Geforce 3. I
have windows 98, 900 mhz AMD, 512 mb of ram. Any ideas? I even reformated
after putting my Voodoo 5 back in.
