I must say, I'm impressed that an open raid managed to drop either Coirnav
or Rathe.  I know level 70 made them easier, but there are some mechanics to
those fights that are very unforgiving of the disorganized.  You should,
instead of complaining, be thanking the guy running those open raids for his
incredible ability to herd cats.

Here's a question for ya.  How many people were on the raids with a
different guild tag than the guy leading?  How many of those were clerics,
bards, rogues, wizards?  If the percentages are as I would hazard a guess
they are, you were just recruited.   =P

Not in the slightest.  It was always a single-group path to KT with a raid
access alternative.

If you want to complain about making things "so much easier" to get people
into new expansions, GoD is probably the worst possible thing to base the
complaint on.  Use DoN...  but then...   wait...  none of the previous flags
matter in the slightest.

Obviously not many people interested in "one of the bestselling games of all
time".  I thought the inference, and the irony, was obvious.  As a game gets
older its ability to gain new players diminishes.  Sony is, on top of
occasionally being a laughingstock, also the envy of the game development
world.  They've got a $4 million a month cash cow, 6 years after release. 
Impressive in any light.
