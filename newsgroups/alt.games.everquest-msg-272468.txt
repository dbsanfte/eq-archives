My thoughts exactly all the potions seem to do is cost me money often with 
no effect trying to find a health one.

Personally I like health potions as a back up and for occasional big mob 
attempts. No health potions does make soloing harder but I suppose they have 
their flaws ie one could end up reliant on them but I suppose there are ways 
of restricting them.
