Though... now that I do think of it, we do have a 3rd account that
presently has a level 11 shaman on it... I could dump her, and use
cleric #1 to PL cleric #2 pretty fast... then... ditch cleric #1 and get
that pretty necklace and create a new shaman on acct #1 so.....
Auuuugh!  I don't know if I can resist this temptation.
