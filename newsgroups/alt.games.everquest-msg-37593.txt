Does your bard worship Veeshen?

I created a bard leveled him to 5 and had a friend port me and run with me
to SS.  Mobs in SS conned dubious.  I would be far easier to raise your CoV
faction then raise your giant faction...

When (if) you join an uber guild they will pick your faction for you anyway
and a couple of raids with them to Kael or SS/WW and you will had reversed
whatever faction you had anyway
