Except that you can't sacrifice a level 60, 46-59 only.  The only way
to get around it is to have the 60 die to mobs (guards work pretty
well) enough to go back to 59, sacrifice 4 times, then have a cleric
rez the mob-death corpses.  A lot of work and I don't any 60s in my
guild stepping up to do this.
