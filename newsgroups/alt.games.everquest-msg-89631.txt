Although I have yet to see a decent sort of event (or even hear of one on
BB) my problem is not so much that they have reactivated the Dark Followers
in Befallen or infested the Qeynos area with undead, it's that these events
were advertised as some "weekend of fun" If this had happened unexpectedly
(as I believe the dark followers did first time around) then I wouldn't
complain (or take the piss)
I would rather these events came across spontaneous and not some arranged
and pre warned occurence that did nothing but raise peoples expectations of
what  was to come.
Saying this, it may all be a prelude to further (and better) events that
won't unfold until someone stops to talk to a new NPC instead of just
killing it and seeing what it drops.
