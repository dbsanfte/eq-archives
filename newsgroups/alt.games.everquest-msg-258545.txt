Makes a big difference to me. My Barb Shammy walks into Nether Lair
from the Nexus, and can't see a damned thing until I use my
Runecrafters Bracer to cast Ultravision. Though I'm using the game
without the active lighting effect on. Makes the world look better to
me and gives me some extra frames when I'm 2Boxing.
