The problems with a lot of these tests is that there were 2 changes to
exp made at the same time.  They smoothed out the 50-60 experience and
changed the exp on blue mobs. There are many possible scenarios that
could be going on in your test:

- The blue mobs gave 50% less exp and the smoothed out level 55 now
requires 50% of the pre-patch exp.

- The blue mobs gave 60% of the exp and the smoothed out level 55 now
requires 60% of the pre-patch exp.
...

- The blue mobs gave 100% of the exp and the smoothed out level 55
requires 100% of the pre-patch exp.


In either of these scenarios, your exp bar would move just about the
same per kill after the patch as it did before. If they did the
changes at separate times, we would be able to figure it out a little
easier.

But, as always, we'll have to wait for the hackers to uncover the real
numbers.  Hurray hackers!
