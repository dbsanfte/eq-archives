I posted the other day about problems with logging in
with a reactivated account and I tried the suggestions
of reinstalling video drivers again after DirectX and
changing my account password. Other things I tried were
doing the thorough file check for everything in EQ patch.
I tried getting a live person at Sony tech support
yesterday but gave up after a long wait on hold. My next
step is drop back to DX7 I guess.  This is on a clean
install of Win2K but I have Deus EX, Ultima online and
Half-Life up and running with no problems so things can't
be screwed up too bad.

Off to Google to see if any of the zillion Nvidia drivers
have a problem with EQ.
