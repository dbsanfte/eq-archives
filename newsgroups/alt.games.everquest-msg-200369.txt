You may (or may not) be interested to know that that's a big part of
the reason I (mostly) abandoned playing melees (including the getting
left behind part).  But then I didn't find levelling quickly with a
solo Druid to be much more interesting than levelling slowly with a
solo Paladin.  And 2-boxing solo isn't much fun.  And 2-boxing to PL
is downright boring (most of the time).  I've recently started to
have fun again on Stromm, why? because I've been grouping my Druid
there at nearly every opportunity.  I've never been much of a fan of
the constant action style of play, yet even so it was a lot more fun
partnering with an "I've got a L65 Monk on Xxx server" Monk for a
level and a half than most of solo play I've done in EQ.  (It was
amazing, we hardly stopped fighting at all.  Totally untwinked, no
extra buffs, just a Monk and a Druid terrorizing the Shiknar in PC.)

The point of the above rambling?  Anything that harms the original
vision of EQ as a grouping game, be it KEI, 'bots, or character
classes that gain experience faster solo than they do grouped, is a
BadThing[tm].  I'm not opposed to solo play, but I am vehemently
opposed to any game mechanic that makes solo play more "effective"
than group play in any but the most unusual of circumstances (well,
ok, when the only groups available are full of complete morons even
Gems can be more effective, or at least less stressful).
