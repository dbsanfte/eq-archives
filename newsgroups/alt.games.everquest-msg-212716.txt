do what you want to do

but if you sell your account, you won't get much....there are too many
scammers around for it to be a 'legit'

don't grind the exp to 60 unless you WANT to do it; there's nothing magical
waiting for you at 60 unless you WANT there to be something there

and the bittersweet: all the new mmorpg's are going to have some eq blood in
them; make sure you play with friends to maximize enjoyment =p
