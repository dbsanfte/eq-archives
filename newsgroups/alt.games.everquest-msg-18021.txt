My dwarf cleric was offering free heals and binds in Kaladim, when a
young wood elf approached and asked me for a SoW. I had to inform her
that no dwarf can SoW anyone.

Once, my wood elf warrior was standing outside Freeport, shouting,
"Tired wood elf seeks bind after long journey." A young halfling
approached and requested a SoW, ignoring my 2-handed sword. I asked him
if he knew what level and class were those who could SoW. He said druids
could at 14. I then asked him if he knew what level druids could cast
Bind. He said he thought it was 14. I said he was correct, and repeated
my shout. 

I used to wear a button that read "Intelligence is the ultimate
aphrodisiac." One gentleman approached me, and asked by way of a pick up
line/icebreaker, "So what's an aphrodisiac?" I explained it to him, and
he said, "Well, I guess I blew that one..."
