Depends on what you want to do.
If you plan to go into dungeons and narrow places I would suggest a tank.
And then preferably a Paladin so he can heal himself when needed.
If you stick to outdoors you can probably kite a lot and a caster would be
great for that (although most nukers have long downtime, maybe an enchanter
for you?).

A friend of mine teams up with his wife and they're both druids. As far as I
can tell they have a great time and are doing great together.

Just my 2c
