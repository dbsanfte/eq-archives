Why no tutorial?

The exp?  Ah, you can leave the tutorial and go back to it, avoiding the 
exp; then if you run the little maze of Q&A with the various tutorial 
people you get the charm up to full effectiveness.

The reason I mention this is that at level 58 my berserker is still 
wearing that charm and likely to keep doing so into his 60s, because 
there's nothing out there better he's likely to get at this stage. 
Eventually his Intricate Wooden Figurine with an augment on it will be 
better, but it isn't now.

I'd do Kurns or Crushbone instead, killing bugs gets really tedious, and
you can get very nearly the same outlandishly good exp at either of the 
above into your mid teens.  If you want to stick to high exp zones 
you'll end up in Paladul soon enough, there's no real reason to start on 
it early.

With 10pp you might want to go shop for a weapon in the bazaar, 
remembering not to pick up anything with a damage over 10 (because your 
damage is capped till level 20 such that any higher damage rating is 
ignored); within that limit go for the lowest delay you can find.
