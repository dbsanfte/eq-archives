Has anyone noticed NON-offensive words being blocked by the chat filter in
EQ?  About 20 months ago, a friend and I were playing and I made reference
something about that we were soon to hear the dong sound for yet another LV
(he hadn't been paying much attention to his EXP at the time so I was
reminding him).  I was surprised to see that "DONG" is filtered.  The last
offensive reference I've heard for "dong" was when I was in 2nd grade and
people would use "dong" as another word for "penis" (now days they just say
"dick" in 2nd grade).  How old are the people who wrote the chat filter?

(and personally I consider it more of a "dong" sound when you LV than a
"ding" sound...Isn't "ding" a high pitched, where "dong" is a lower pitched
sound?)
