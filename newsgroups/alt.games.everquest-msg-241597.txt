I've taken to paying for my accounts a month at a stretch, then
stopping billing immediately.  It creates a few seconds of inconvenience
at the start of each month when I have to re-enter my billing information,
but it has a nice side effect: After my billing date, if I'm not playing,
I'm not paying.

WoW was way below my radar until recently, and even with my new
interest in it, it has nothing to do with my reluctance to log on.  The 
way they pushed this patch live with bugs that have existed since they
pushed it in GoD Beta has left me with little desire to play and have my
*fun* disrupted time and again by those bugs.  I play to have fun, not
to be frustrated.
