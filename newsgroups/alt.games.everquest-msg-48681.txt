<snip stuff implying bizbee is stalking himself>

Ok..he's an obvious question..Why the hell would Biz stalk himself when the lot
of us could give two shits? I mean..sure, if he is being usenet-stalked, sucks

newsgroup could care less.
*shrug* Just because it's possible doesn't mean it's probable.
