My question was vague.  Sorry.  :(

For the record, I never intended summoned/foraged items to be
counted as gear.  Anything easily obtained as a class ability
mostly doesn't count as gear in my mind, though I can see where
technically it is gear.

Sorry for the confusion.

Based on what I've read, I think it's hard to make the call
between mage and necro.  If we include RACE in the question,
though, I think iksar necromancer might win.  Mostly because
necros are powerful enough to be effective without a pet
(thus, no reagents necessary), and also because the iksar can
forage the necessary food/water.

A mage (of any race) is always dependent on malachite.  The
iksar necro isn't dependent on bone chips (due to power) and
isn't dependent on food/water (due to foraging).

So I'd personally vote necro (specifically, iksar necro) the
king of "least gear dependent".
