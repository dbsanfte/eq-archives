A couple of questions.  I was able to turn in molars, while dubious, by
hitting hide just after clicking on Likus with the molar.  Would this be
considered an exploit?

Also, I turned in a bunch of molars to him, (probably around 30 or so)
one at a time, but am still dubious.  How many molars do you need to get
out of dubious?
