No, turning it off, deleting the .txc files from your eq directory,
and logging in. Once this is done, you can back out and turn it back
on just fine. Possibly some textures were added that just screwed up
the existing cache client-side. Possibly shifting some kind of tables
so they didn't match up anymore with the server-side flags or some
such. *shrug*

At any rate, it's definately not something that'll require patching to
fix.
