 Excluding Velious the spell drops are only on mobs level 45 or above if
I remember correctly. They are not exactly common either so don't expect
a spell to drop off every mob you kill. If you want dropped Druid spells
you should go to Burning Woods or Skyfire. Also try the auction zone on
your server. You can probably buy most of them for a few hundred
platinum each.
