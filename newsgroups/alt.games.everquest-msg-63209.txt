And for Karana worshippers, why not imbue a couple of those *free* plains 
pebbles you keep foraging in the Karanas and get some earrings with *more 
WIS* than Forest loops by giving them to a friendly enchanter along with a 
couple of 10pp gold bars. No enchanter ever sells golden imbued plains 
pebble earrings because they don't usually have a clue what they can make 
with imbued gems, can't imbue the gems for followers of any religions 
themselves, and wouldn't do it off their own back anyway due to the 
restricted market the jewelry would have. If someone brings them some pre-
imbued gems however...

The Karana-imbued earrings are WIS+4 STA+2 STR-3 I think (and you shouldn't 
miss the Strength when you can buff yourself).
