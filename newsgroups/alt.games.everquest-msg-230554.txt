Add me to the list.  Happened twice to my Shaman.  Since I don't have
a mount, maybe having a "pet" sort of thingy is part of the problem.
So far, mount and pet seem to be a common thread.  
Oh, I've seen very heated arguments over top or bottom posting.  I
prefer bottom.  I've asked a friend at work and he's a bottom poster
too.  Since we are ancient.  (50 and 52) and have been at this for
since the bulitin board days maybe that's helps with our preference.

Q.
