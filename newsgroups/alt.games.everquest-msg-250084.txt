I actually didn't hear anything ... I read it on all the class boards
.. mostly high end raiding content .. sucks.

A sop to those present .. didn't work for me .. I wasn't there and
neither were the people who could represent me as a player.

That is the same thing that Brenlo said on the SOE boards some four
months ago .. doesn't wash I am afraid.

I do and I don't like what I saw on those sites.


Now let's have a look at some of the other stuff talked about on the
Steelwarrior site.

"quote"
A few other things not mentioned but probably should be:
AA requirements for being able to level in Omens were called "rumors". 

who cares no one will buy it after GoD.

"quote"
They are going to pick a raid number and stay with it. (Got the feeling
it would be 54).

High end stuff again ... aimed at the 10% minority.
"quote"
OOW will only have a very small number (I was told 1) of locked zones.
The end encounters will be locked, but anyone will be free to go into
the zone.

who cares no one will buy it after GoD.
"quote"
Boots of Despair - The taunt mod does work for us. 
"unquote"
Oh no guess what ... it's a Plane of Time drop.
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22422
"quote"
Inspect Buffs Leader AA should show your own buff timers as well. 
"unquote"

High end raiding crap.

"quote"
There are new armor sets coming to ldon which will be
elemental-calibre. The price cap at 1452 will be raised, to what I
don't know.
"unquote"

Now this must be low end stuff ... sigh.

"quote"
You will be able to remove your augments from your armor soon. 
"unquote"

Umm ... you can now you just lose them.

"quote"
Some GoD spells will be available via quest. 
"unquote"

who cares no one is lvl 70 and able to use GoD properly.

"quote"
Veeshans Peak revamp is coming very soon. When I asked if the old key
would be needed, I was told: "You take the old key, and some new stuff,
and make the new key -- then you get a reward for your old key."
"unquote"

VP is low/middle range now I assume.

"quote"
The Customer service system is being improved (And has improved) quite
a bit.
"unquote"

Brenlo bullwhizz

"quote"
Lots of talk of improving LDON for the more casual or smaller numbered
raiders. Creating an alternate progression path to elemental -> time.
"unquote"

Ah now that is interesting and designed to pee off the top 10%.

"quote"
They seem to want to instance most/all progression targets. This is
good.
"unquote"

Could be good for low/middle players/guilds

"quote"
Guild Banking seems to be on the way. 
"unquote"

Only good for high ends ... the rest of us just donate a slot for a
bank.  If you want to see a high end bank which will benefit from this
system log into my server (Bristlebane).  lag into Bazaar and search
for Fubanker (high end banker who will benefit from this potential
change ... Club Fu guild)

"quote"
Brenlo wants a halfling bard.
"unquote"

Give him one as part of his redundancy package.

Waste of space really.
