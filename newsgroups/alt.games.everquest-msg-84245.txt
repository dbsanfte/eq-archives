The guild I am in is similar to yours, however, if something like Ragefire
spawning happens, then certainly I would expect to see an announcement in
guild, but it would be more like "Ragefire has spawned, can anyone come help
take him down".  At which point I would expect that most, probably not quite
all, guild members of the appropriate level would start asking about getting
a ride there.  Noone would be deguilded if they couldn't make it.  If some
particular person always refused to help, they would probably find that they
in turn do not get much help from the guild.
