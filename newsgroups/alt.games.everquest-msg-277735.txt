I can understand why some items are marked as LORE but my point was
specify aimed at the body parts you need to collect for mastery quests.
For example, I was working the low level skeletons in Forest Ruins for
get the skeleton mastery items. I couldn't for the life of me find
the skeleton core, so I want to the nearest brooker and bought it. So
what has the LORE tag achieved? It didn't force me to complete the
quest. I stopped me from using an item an alt had. You could argue the
latter stops me collecting them and PL up but the fact you can trade
them nullifies that argument.

I am equally baffled as why the language quest items are marked as
LORE. You need multiply of theses to complete the quest, so what's
the point in restricting me to carrying one at a time? It would be much
better if I could collect the complete set and use them all at once,
like collections and the aforementioned mastery items.

I can understand SOE not wanting people to trade them, since again you
could PL up alts, but the NO TRADE label on them achieves that. So,
what does the LORE tag actually achieve? And don't say its
unbalancing the point is why is unbalancing for me to have carry
multiple copies of an item I need multiple copies of!!
