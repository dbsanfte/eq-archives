Igok is a froglok wizard who did some experimenting with teleport spells
and sent fragments of himself to Nektulos and Greater Faydark, maybe other
places, I forget. If you're a froglok wizard yourself, you can kill him
as part of a quest and (eventually) get an Improved Damage 2 belt, frg/wiz
only, around L30.

Doesn't do anything for *you* as a dark elf, so kill him cheerfully, knowing
you're preventing some amphibious harry-potter wanna-be from getting a
snazzy toy for at least another 20 minutes, and (in the ultimate twist of
irony) gaining the accolades of other frogs. Woot!
