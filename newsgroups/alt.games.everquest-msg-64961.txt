Im jealous and you also have given me hope for my puter.  I have the exact
same thing except Im running a voodoo banshee.  I cannot get into the game
as of yet, but they have found a problem with voodoo cards that they are
suppose to be addressing and there will be a patch 1am pacific for the intel
chip also.  Maybe I could be lucky like you.  I have no idea if you will
have any problems considering they have stated min. requirements for this
luclin now is a pentium 2 266 and higher.  Which is poopy in my opinion
because this is the best puter I have ever had.  Anyways, I really hope for
you that you have zero problems and continue to play.  Good luck!

Sheri  :)
