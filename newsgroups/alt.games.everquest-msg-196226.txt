couple of quick tips before I hit hte sack tonight, so take whatever snippy
edge with a grain of salt.

Mages aren't worth squat.  I don't care what anyone tells you, they aren't
worth their weight in Gnoll dung.  No one want's em, and when they DO manage
to find a group, they get bitched at for their pets.  Their spells are
resisted a LOT, they haven't much use aside from summoning junk (and the
occasional useful item).  I know because I have played one, and a friend of
mine has played one well into the 50's.

You aren't going to be able to travel very far for a while without trouble.
That's just the way it is, unless you have some higher level friends that
can SoW/invis you.

My guess is that on the new server, becaue there are no character transfers
from other servers, everyone is in a rush to be the first to 65.

send the person a direct /tell when they ask about groups.

/tell player_01 I'll join you...

No one likes mages for groups.

The chatroom is basically a place where the kids go to bitch.

the game can be fun, just give it time.  no class reallyt starts to define
itself until level 20. thats about when you see Clerics and Druids backing
off and stop fighting in melee combat, where wizards start doing some decent
damage, where they all really start to show their unique abilities.  If you
want a group, one of these three classes are almost always guaranteed to be
invited:  Cleric, Shaman, Enchanter, Warrior.

Cleric for healing, Shaman for buffing, Enchanter for crowd control and
buffs and of course the meat shield.

give it some time.
