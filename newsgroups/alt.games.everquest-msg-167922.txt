Not from my experience. I don't recall any official statements in
regards to what you mentioned, either. I honestly don't see how losing
less experience when dying at 46 would make the exploit you talk about
possible. If anything, you'd end up regaining LESS than you lost (If
rezzes restoring xp worked off of the same calculation) if you died
right before the change then waited to get rezzed after.
