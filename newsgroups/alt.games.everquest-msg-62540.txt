It won't work with being in luclin. The bare minimum in ram for luclin
is 128 meg to NOT enable the new models but just to be in the luclin
zones.
It will still work with EQ (unless they keep screwing up the dx8 dll
thing.. bleah)

Your proc is fine though since they make no distinction about proc
type just speed, yes, a celeron is more or less a p2 proc (the cache
on it is not that big a deal for gaming really):

I'd get at least a 256 meg simm, they are darn cheap now.

"Required Specs:

Windows� 98/2000/ME/XP 
Pentium� II 400Mhz or greater 
256 MB RAM 
16 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&L (i.e. Nvidia
GeForce/GeForce 2 or ATI Radeon) 
DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card 
28.8 K+ Internet connection 
4X speed CD-ROM 
450 MB+ hard drive space

Note: Although technically below the minimum specs, players with 128
MB of RAM will still be able to run Luclin by turning off the new
character models. 

Recommended Specs:

Windows� 98/2000/ME/XP 
Pentium� III or greater 
512 MB RAM 
32 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&L (i.e. ATI Radeon
or Nvidia GeForce 2 or greater) 
DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card 
56.6 K+ Internet connection 
16X speed CD-ROM 
1.5 GB+ hard drive space

Note: DirectX 8.0 or greater is required. System requirements subject
to change as the game progresses. "
