What I'd like to see happen is the tailoring and other kits become lore, it
does make sense as you should only need one for it's intended purpose. Of
coarse I am a tailor myself, so this would be a good thing (for me).
The other thing is the market for HQ bear skins (would probably) decrease. I
for one will think twice about buying a skin for 20pp or more.. so that
mother load when a newbie gets lucky and finds one is going to be less
fruitful.
