I see it this way. They know how much it's worth. they're hoping I don't,
and that I offer more than it's worth. that way, they're making even more of
a profit than they'd hoped.

call me a cynic, but that's the way I see it.
and I won't make an offer.
tell me what YOU want for it, or find another sucker...
