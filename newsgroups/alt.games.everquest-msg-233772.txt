Hiya,

you also could try to get good money and exp while doing mammuths in
everfrost .... not hard to kill, should give you exp still and drop
tusks that sell for about 10pp each to vendors... (get a few bags that
can hold giantitems like tailoringkits)...

Next thing good for your level in a group would be Marus Seru.... get
good exp and low quality rockhopperhides there and make steelboning out
of them which sell good in bazaar... good money at your level =)

Have fun in game 

Christian
