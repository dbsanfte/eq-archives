It *DID* click with me.  About fifteen minutes into the game.  I was talking
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION.  Sure, mobs can't zone, but so what?  They also
can't be grouped with (as I understand it that is a requirement for TP, go
ahead and jump on me some more if it isn't), and they also can't be TPed
because beneficial spells do not affect them.  In short, I know three
reasons why it couldn't happen.  OK?

I agree, and that's why I responded to him instead of KFing him.  I just
dislike playground-style verbal exchanges.  "Duh" is what little children
taunt each other with.  Roughly, it means "EVERYONE knows that, so you must
be stupid, neener neener."  You can take me apart logically, you can prove
you are smarter than me, you can say you disagree with me, you can call me
just about anything, and I will applaud your efforts.  I simply do not take
well to being called stupid.  Call it a character flaw.

As for my return question for him, I'm afraid it was all I could think of.
I work a full-time job and I have hobbies other than this.  I don't have
time to memorize Everquest minutiae and I didn't have time to research some
insignificant tidbit with which to stump Matt.  Besides which, if I had come
up with one, he'd most likely have gotten it.  I'm sure he knows ten times
more about EQ than I do, and he probably always will.  There.  I am lame.
I've admitted it.  Is everyone happy?
