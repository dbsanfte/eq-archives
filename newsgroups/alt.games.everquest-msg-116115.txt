Speaking as somebody who generally LIKES Microsoft products, I gotta
disagree.  The computer industry being the behemoth that it is now
owes more to IBM than Microsoft, all told, because they decided to
leave their architecture open.  This created competition in the market
place.  That competition is why I can now go out and buy a machine for
LESS than $800.

Microsoft is dead set against that kind of competition, which is why
the employ either the "Engulf and Devour" (tm Mel Brooks) approach to
competitors, or simply create an environment where competitors CANNOT
compete (ie. Giving away Internet Explorer to shithammer Netscape).
Not that I necessarily hold that against them.  They are a business
after all, and Microsoft's first goal is to make money.  And it's
easier to do that if you don't have to share the market with another
company.

But, despite what Bill Gates thinks, what's good for Microsoft is NOT
necessarily good for computing in general.

What computing really, really needs right now is for some large
corporation to throw a lot of money behind Linux.  Kinda like what
Apple did with their OS 10, but for the PC.  I mean a LOT of money
too.  Hell, you'd think IBM would try just as kind of a screw you for
the whole OS/2 thing.
