Lets define 'related' as interoperative on some level. LDON is 
interoperative with EQ1, LOE isn't. EQ2 depending on just what is meant 
by 'crossover zones' may be interoperative to EQ1.

Actually I think its both slimy and good marketing.

I wouldn't have gone that far either.

/agree. That where I see it as well. But rather than reduce the price of 
LOE to stimulate sales or create a bundle of say PreOrder EQ2 + LOE for 
75.00 or buy LoE for 50.00 but get a 15.00 coupon towards EQ2 or any of 
a zillion other honest promotions they pulled this lousy stunt.

Oh... I get it... it adds value to the product I didn't want :)
But in this case it removes value from the product I do want.

/agree

I'm not bothered by it either. It is simply a fact, one that comes into 
play because things would be different if it were not a fact. But its 
not something I'm suggesting they shouldn't have.

/disagree

On some level sure. But on another, not at all... Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers and X2 are both movies, but you couldn't make we watch MMPR. If 
there was no X2 I simply wouldn't rent a movie that evening... I would 
not select MMPR because it was 'essentially the same product'. In the 
world of movies and books things are pretty substitutable ... there are 
literally thousands of each. MMRPGS are still pretty limited, and its 
not difficult to arrive at a place where you only like one of them 
enough to play.

Then in your case LoE hopefully had some value on its own :)

And pay the higher interest rate as a result....
