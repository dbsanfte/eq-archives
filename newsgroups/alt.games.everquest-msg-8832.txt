I've played on regular servers, but after the extensive over crowding,
over camping, and whiney kids I moved on. Sure it's my opinion, but
plenty of people here whine so why can't I? I can rant about how I think
it is utterly stupid for a Troll to gain faction in a human city? I think
its
moronic that groups wait _IN LINE_ to camp orcs for belts! I will
certainly rant about the whiners on the Carebear Servers!

Maybe you're right, but as they say, "the truth hurts".
