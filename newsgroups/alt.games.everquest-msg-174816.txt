There are still communist nations, one of which is making a big ruckus right
now.  Reality isn't as different as you claim it is.  For those under
communist rule, it's still communism as usual.

The princes of Saudi Arabia want us there because we're what's standing
between them and Iraqi's rolling in.  The saudi's want Iraq there even less
than they do us.  But, since we're there now, we're the ones that are being
protested (as if they would have the liberty do protest Iraq if we weren't
there).

The cold war is where we did the majority of sticking our necks out.  If you
want to say that it's over and that all bets are off, fine, then we don't
get blamed for anything we did during it, either, right?  The reality of the
matter is somewhat different.  Effects of the past still linger, and saying
"it's over" won't change anything.

Opening markes also allows us to feed and clothe people without having to do
it through straight foreign aid.  It allows us to try to build industries
and economies.  It may be a bit of the "white man's burden," but it doesn't
make us the devil.  We also give aid to our enemies, such as Iraq, North
Korea, and the U.S.S.R. during the cold war.

And we would be blamed any way we tried.

If you didn't serve, then you have no place throwing around the term
"chickenhawk."  It's a judgement apon their lack of military service, as if
it somehow means they're unfit to make national policy.
