Third choice, the one I took. I always created my own groups and never
bothered to invite Knights. If anyone asked.. we got all the tanking
we need, k thx. Its really a lot better now that any gibroni can get a
CBoS/SotB combo to start with and GBoS isn't that hard to get with
pretty much any guild doing BoT towers. It used to be you could be
walking around with a fleshgrinder/frosty *shudder*. Where a lot of
good groups go wrong is when friends invite friends regardless of
their usefulness. Like some shithead wanting to invite his warrior
friend even though I was allready in group for no other reason than
Johnny didn't have a group atm. Fuck Johnny.. he can make his own
group and not have to waste my time with his shitty dps i'm all too
aware of.

>My thoughts on a good group would be to have a Warrior Main Tank and a
>Paladin as assistant tank.

Hah.. any group that needs a pally as an assistant tank isn't a good
group. Either Warrior or Paladin as tank, having both is redundant.
Most of the groups I setup were mostly slanted towards insanely
massive damage with a balanced group for stability. Keeping in mind
i'm referencing them at their 65 levels....

Warrior, Rogue, Bard, Beastlord, Cleric/Druid, Necro was always a fun
stable group. warrior takes point.. bard runs the CC while the
beastlord slows. At high levels the Rogue, Beastlord, Mage, Necro all
provide insane damage and the Bard can enhance that while providing
his own. I always steered away from shammies because unless they were
top notch their damage was shit compared to a BL.

Specialty groups were always fun. My favorite was:

Team Backstab - Warrior, 3 Rogues, Bard, Cleric. Warrior point, bard
puller/cc, healer, and pure unadulterated kickass. The group i had
with 3 elemental equipped rogues would hose easies in 20 minutes flat.
Sooner given luck on drops.

I tend to find the best way to cure an overagroing caster is a painful
death. Especially when they're usually the only one that died. If
someone is always getting jumped I usually ask wtf are you casting and
why so early? If you want to go off the reservation casting wise, feel
free to do so, the cleric will pop you a rezz when you hit Tranq.

>As far as your comment about Malo goes maybe the shamans got tired of
>hearing the others bitch about then being too slow with their slows.

As long as the mob gets slowed in a reasonable amount of time, I've
never had that issue. Certainly never on Malo/Slow. What shamans want
is to not have to spend the mana for Malo. One cast is easier than two
and shorter and it opens a spell slot.. and for SK/Pally.. the agro
they have IS enough to just disregard Malo and just slow. But warriors
aren't given the tools to agro that fast and overcome straight slow
agro. Procs can be little fuckers and take forever to go off, even
with the new AA, incite you get once every 30 seconds, and normal
taunt is still active but tends to fail a lot, and when it succeeds it
isn't THAT much agro. That having been said, once the procs get
rolling and shit.. pally/sk have a hard as fuck time getting agro
later in a fight and in an agro fight from go you just /shield them
:>.

Nah.. second time around go for the slow.. by then the agro should
have been built up. The problem is slowing off the engage before any
significant agro by a warrior can be generated. Pally/SK agro is spike
agro, but they are also limited by their mana bar for agro. They cast
a stun or a lifetap that gives immediate amounts of agro, warrior will
build his over time. That's why you have assist calls for locking agro
on raid level mobs. Either way, yeah spell haste items can make a lot
of difference. But simple fact is if SK/pally is having to chain for
agro to overcome idiot caster.. they'll probably go OOM over time and
have to med. And I personally can't conceive of anything more boring
than taking a seista while a tank meds.

I played a necro for a while though and just loathe paladin pulling
for LDoN's. Its a liability that some use as a necessary evil at
certain levels. At 65 a warrior can run rings around a paladin pulling
wise because they really don't give a flying fuck if they get hit,
especially by such low hitters. I'd run in a room agro all while the
chanter CC'd off me, cleric hit me with CH and if needed i /shielded
the cleric for extra time or AT'd to pull them off the cleric if it
was up. Then the group dps would just walk the room and tear it apart.
I could also go defensive if needed to halve the damage or go warrior
DA(furious/fortitude) every 40 minutes and not get hit for 12 seconds.
I'd usually transition tank at 10-20% of mob life and just call assist
when the previous one dead. It was fun shit. Even funnier was at
10-20% transitioning and running to the next room to agro two-four
more with the casters and dps in tow trying to kill the one on my ass.
Made an easy way not to have to tell people to move up, just chase
that mob umm k. My feeling on easy LDoN's was the same from my days in
DL.. the killing never stops and when it does and you aren't done
you're wasting time. I've bounced quarters off caster mana pools with
how far they can be stretched.

I never liked having both because it meant two spots were taken up
with classes who couldn't generate much damage but do the same thing.
One spot reasonable, with chanter favored over shaman for CC reasons..
two nah. On higher level stuff... sure.
