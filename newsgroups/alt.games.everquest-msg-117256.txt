Boy, they sure are some genius programmers over there at Verant!
Here, I've reversed Ocean of Tears for them without ever having
seen the code:

---------- 8< Cut here for 31337 fix of OOT problem ----------
if (the player is in OOT) {
	tell the client that north is south and vice versa
	tell the client that east is west and vice versa
	}
else { just don't lie, stupid! }
-------- 8< Cut here too, otherwise it won't compile! --------

This will fix the zone 100% from the viewpoint of the clients.
Of course, the zone would now be full of NPCs who lied about
destinations and directions and stuff, and it would be very
confusing for veteran players, but this is the quick and easy
solution they should've come up with when the problem first
was discovered, which I believe is a *long* time ago. (Surely
they were made aware of it already in beta?)

But of course, actually thinking of a fix like this requires
a room-temperature IQ (I should know, I have one!), so no
surprise they haven't done this already... I mean, anyone who
would build maps in such a way that object paths can't be
reversed without rebuilding the map probably won't be winning
any Nobels in the near future...
