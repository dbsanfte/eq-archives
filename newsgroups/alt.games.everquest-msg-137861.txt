Bards... Idol.. AoW.. /shudder
I don't even wanna think about how many times we've had messed up agro /
auto pulls as a result of this.  I guess the "turn songs off for pull"
concept is too tough to follow :)

We've had a train of Idol and or AoW agro when they shouldn't on every
single raid I can recall, and even Idol is enough to destroy your entire
raid in the first 20 seconds (casters and clerics all sitting, as theres no
pull message yet)

FD seemed to work about 1 in 5 times, every other time he saw through..

What did he drop for you guys?
