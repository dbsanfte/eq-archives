That's all I am really saying is that there appears to be bugs and
balance issues all over that would help stablize the main core of teh
game. To Verant's credit, they do spend resources to fix some of them.
But, I really cannot imagine how this idea rose to the top of the
workload pile. Is everything else good to go?

I hope Sigha is right and it is lunchtime code (harmless). Just kinda
seemed like fidelling while Rome burns.
