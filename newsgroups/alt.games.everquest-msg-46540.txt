Goodness, I feel like a troll, however, I've just come to realize that if
there isn't anything a terrorist hasn't thought of doing by now, this thread
sure as hell is contributing to the "idea's bank."

<shrug>

I have my Atropine and Gas Mask ready, both Navy issue as of 1998.  The
Atropine might have expired, dunno, it's still in the outside shed.  I errm,
acquired those items for nostalgic reasons or atleast the mask (reminds me
of gas-chamber training day in boot, god that sucked), the Atropine came
with the package.

A MRE came with that all as well, which I never understood since to eat you
have to remove your mask and just how long is a MRE going to last one
person? <grin>  Perhaps it is a "last meal" never did think of that until
now.

Anyway, the issues at hand are obviously serious and the events of the 11th
were most certainly a "wake up" call, but, that does't mean you need to
start your morning with an entire pot of coffee, or a can of Jolt.
