SOUND: does Everquest support any kind of 3-D sound 4 or 5 speakers,
Creative's EAX  or does it just support stereo 2 speaker sound.  I do
definitely notice a stereo effect,  you can listen for hill giants steps and
tell what direction they are coming from but does the game out put distinct
sound for back speakers?



     If I have 2 decent speakers is there anything to be gained by adding
back speakers?



VIDEO  I have a Geforce 2 TI 64 meg card, am I really going to notice any
significant improvement by getting a Geforce 4 4200 64meg card, currently I
do not have any problems or notice anything which would indicate my video
card is running slow.
