  Yes Dark Elf's are KOS in Kunark (Cabalis anyway) barring you doing some
of the faction raising quests (which can be tedious at best I imagine).
  As far as getting there is a travel guide on www.eqatlas.com to get to
Kunark that's pretty good. Or you could get a port or come from the moon, I
don't remember where either lands you but as I recall there not fun places
to be unless your prepared.
