A word or two of advice is in order re: the PoK port to FV.  The book
is in a spur of the tunnel system that leads to the Dreadlands, you'd
do well to have a decent map.  There are elven guards who wander the
tunnels (none path to the book tho) so if you are an evil race invis
would be helpful.  There are Drachnids (DE/spider hybrids) that wander
the area outside the tunnels, they are very KOS Rangers and some of
them are L30 or higher (i.e. some of them can cast SoW and See Invis),
so if you are using camo/invis to get past them con from a distance
and avoid any that are not indifferent.  There is a high level Necro
NPC for somebody's epic between the tunnels and the FV outpost, not
everybody is KOS to her, but if you are you would be very well advised
to avoid her.  If you are an 18+ Druid or a Wizard you can succor
over to very near the FV outpost, an area patrolled by "good" NPCs.
