Picnic at the Parc, barbeque hotdogs (premium brand), chips, pop, 
fruit... 50.00 tops and probaly covers your gas & parking too. Add fly a 
kite, kick a ball, run a badminton tournament, all for the one time 
expense of the various bits of equipment.


> Thats 300.00 dollars.. for two lousy nights of entertainment....

Its not my fault your dating with your kids along. =)

Make your kids pay for their popcorn and pop out of their allowances. 
They'll figure out what a ripoff it is on their own, or they won't. 
Either way its no incremental cost to you that way.
