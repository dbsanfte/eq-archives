Thank you. I have NOTHING against jokes or even offensive ones but it is all in
context, ya know? I apologize if I sounded vitrolic, "september posterish" and
knee-jerk pinko, liberal, commie rantish. I just thought that joke, in that place
was not funny or appropriate. It really is an old joke. And not funny. But again,
just my opinion. Also, the implication that GOD said it was a bad thing.... Well,
enough already! So, in conclusion, I apologize to all who I offended by stating my
state of being offended, particularly liberals, communists and rednecks in general,
and bonda in particular. I thank you again for getting rid of it. So, you can still
sod off if you please, but you don't have to die. (tone of that last line is meant
for a laugh not to continue flame war)
