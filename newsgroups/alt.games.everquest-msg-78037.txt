I have recently joined a great guild on Xev, 'Azure Legion' and it's made a
huge difference for me in terms of enjoying the game. I had gotten so tired
of the slow pace of advance when I hit 51 with my monk that I quit playing
for almost a month. I had been a part of a couple of other guilds
previously, but neither one had enough high level people to do the kind of
things I wanted to be doing with a lv 51 character. I finally joined up with
AL cause a friend of mine was in it and immediately started doing some of
the things I had wanted to do for a long time. The first time I hooked up
with them we raided Sirens Grotto and I got a pair of Netted Kelp Pants.

Well I've had a blast with them in general but last night we raided the
Arena in Kael. I've been there before and tried to pull Bjork the Cold but
failed to get past his Protector's. We had a lv 60 monk pulling for us and
after checking with a ranger in my group, let him know Bjork was up and told
him, meaning it as a joke, "Hey, Dreadstone Bjork is up, bring him to us."
Well a few minutes later he announces, Bjork incoming , some monk is gonna
get lucky. Beside Dreadstone, there were only 3 monks there last night so I
knew my chances where pretty good. I said "Please, please, please god let me
win this roll" and rolled a 965 out of 1000. I nearly fainted, and then the
other two monks rolled, one got 400 and one got 600 and I was about to be
hysterical. So they said loot up and I wasn't in the group that got exp for
the kill and I was nervous someone would loot it ahead of me, so I stood
over his dead body clicking like a madman till I could actually get my
prize.

I'm now the proud wielder of the Scepter of Mastery, 13 dam , 21 delay, 6
agi, 6 stam , wooo hooo. And I've spent months playing off and on in the
Doggy Tower in KC trying to get a jade mace.

PS: Thanks to Baron Dreadstone for his excellent pulling and all the others
there that made it possible.
