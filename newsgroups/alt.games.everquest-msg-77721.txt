I've been offering a green jade axe (17/34) Shimmering Partisan (17/39)
Sword of the Senschal (14/24) with a list of other weapons, all for 1k
each in ECo on the brief occasions I've had to go there. I wanted cash
for a horse. I had tons of shit like that. I didn't want to waste my
time in ECo.

Guess what?

I didn't sell a single one, so ended up giving a lot of them away to
people actually knowledgeable and working for their upgrades. I got my
horse now. I got better things to do that try to convince someone my 1k
sword is better offhand than xxxx 2k offhand sword

Why? Because they're not the 'fashionable' centi longsword, or Lammy,
and the majority of people want that and that alone because they don't
know enough about the game and the weapons themselves to make a
different/better choice.

The first 2 are Kunark weapons, I'd assume there are comparable SoV and
SoL junk out there that is equally obscure and sold cheaper for better
stats.
