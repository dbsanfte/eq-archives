Ok, I raced a cleric who had my SoW while I had Scale of Wolf, and it is indeed 
faster. Not doublely fast as I would have expected by the spell descriptions I 
read, but definitely faster. I'm not sure if it cares what your current weight 
is, but it seemed to be a good deal faster when I ran with it at 60lbs 
overweight. I did like using Spirit of Cheetah with that 60lb deficiency and 
running from NK Druid rings to the Nexus in like 10 seconds lol. I'll have to 
give Cheetah a go again without so much weight... I sure wish the recast wasn't 
so high, maybe 3 or 4 minutes.
