Um Alexa, you are aware that when you are rezzed, you lose all your mana,
right?  Wolfie pointed out some possible valid reasons not to do the rez.  I
do agree that it is your mana to do with as you choose, and you may have
noted that Dan did not say anything to the cleric, but, in all fairness, the
cleric was waiting to be rezzed, when the cleric got his rez, he was going
to lose all of his mana.  Why not use some of the mana that is about to be
wasted to help out a fellow player?  I would have if I could rez.  I do so
with any of the buffs I can do, I try to be oom before I get rezzed.

I do agree with your sentiment in general, just not in the particular case
in question.
