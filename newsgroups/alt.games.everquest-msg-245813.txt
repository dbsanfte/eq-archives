No, theres a zonein you have to clik on or run over to zone in. Each of your
party will zone into the same zone, but other parties will go to a different
zone, or maybe a different copy of your dungeon.
The MMC zoneing are in lesser fay (2 of them)
Everfrost's are in everfrost
Nro are in oasis
Sro are in upper guk.
EC is in Nro (I think). Been a while since i did EC
