#1 cause of a failed FD. = DOT.  If there is a dot on the mob, it will know
you are faking it the next pulse of your dot.  With the addition of dot
spam, you can see when the dot component of your darkness wheres off, this
is when to FD.  IF you do it and then you see a "MOB AGD  was hit for XX
points of non melee damage by YYY spell" prepare to get kicked while on the
ground.

#2 most commen cause of a failed FD =  Auto Attack.  YOu have to turn auto
attack of "Before" you FD.  Would you believe that something was dead if it
tried to take a swing at you after it fell to the ground? (Kabolds dont
count.  thats just the last of there nerves twitchen =) ) I always have FD
in the 8th spell gem, and set upa  FD macro that look's like this

/pause 1, /attack off
/pause 5, /cast 8
/pause 5, /cast 8
/pause 5, /cast 8
/cast 8

The 1/10 second pause after turning auto attack off is just incase of lag.
the 1/2 second after casting is for if I get interupted/fizzle. IT always
takes 1/2 second to refresh.  If your FD takes on the first cast, the other
3 will simply not happen as you cant cast whn you are Feigning Death.

The last reason, is just bad luck. If you don't have a dot going, and you
turned Auto Attack off, and the mob still beates you while you are on the
ground it is just bad luck.  Pop back up, run and in 15 seconds try again.
When I get a failed Fd I can normaly get it to take the next time.   Don't
wait till you are at 3% HP and 2%mana.  if you wait this long you are dead.
I normaly Fiegn at 10% if the mob has more than 2 % left. I find that I
always get a bad string off misses at about 10%... It is probably just my
emagination, but I have died to mobs that wher at 0% when i was at 10% hp
and couldn't hit them or get a life tap out.  Save enough mana for 3 attemps
at FD this way if you get a fail and a fizzle you still have one more try
left.
