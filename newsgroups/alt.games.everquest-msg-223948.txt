Well, having dusted off my 44 bard, I'm currently going through the process 
of re-equipping him. Once that's done, I'll be standing there scratching my 
head, I would imagine, looking for a good place to hunt.

One thing that burned me out on him before was soloing. It may be the fact 
that the last stuff I soloed was in OT and was really starting to slow down 
as far as xp goes. Anyone got any ideas for my bardic pleasure? LDoN? Any 
good solo spots for my level? Any good group spots for my level?

Also, there was some talk recently about CHA possibly being the largest 
factor in missing notes. Did we determine this was not the case and that 
stats likely have little to do with it? Is it pretty much just your 
instrument skill level?
