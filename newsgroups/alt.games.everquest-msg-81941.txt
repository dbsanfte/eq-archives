> hehe, you'd think so wouldn't you. Kinda like 'Don't attack until the MT
> has agro'

One thing i've noticed, IMO, getting agro is kindof like an ego boost for
some people.. "oh look, i outdamaged the uber MA"  (like damage is the sole
factor in getting agro)  or the caster groups who've gotta get exp.. you
know, the mob is inc.. blast blast.. suddenly your melees have to run over
all the casters to get to the mob.

> What, in your opinion, led you to win against a dual wielding Statue?
> Apply that to AoW

That he was slowable, (im guessing he has a lot less HP then AoW too)
I guess also because were used to fighting him, we can take him down with
minimal or zero deaths.. wheras "move into arena, AoW inc soon" lead to some
people panicking "its impossible we can kill AoW!!!"

It was all over pretty fast, I didn't see when the MA went down.. tho im
pretty sure it was when he summoned me and killed me.  From what I saw, in
the few minutes we were alive, the MA was holding agro. At the same time
though, the 60 rogue and 60 paladin in my group were dead before I was (it
was too fast and hectic to notice the exact order of things)  so I don't
know if they grabbed agro, or if they were next on the list after the MA
went down.

I think the main problem was if you did get agro for a second (failed evade,
failed FD, is jolts resistable?) you were simply dead.  We were very lacking
on clerics, I don't think there were any at all outside the rotation group,
so whoever else got agro died.  But even with a cleric, once you gained agro
you dropped in 5 seconds anyway.. which leads us to your next point..
something I forgot about at the time heh

That would of course answer my last question.. however, I remember a bob
attempt a lil while back (just a 1 group pickup thing) I had agro and was
tanking it, but as soon as I riposte disced, I totally lost agro.  Remember
the changes they made, that if your not hittable a mob will pick a different
target

Well hopefully with our full raid crew, we can give him a serious try.  Even
though it was a wipeout, it was a blast.  Tormy and Statue are probably 2 of
the most boring fights for me now.. trivial to kill, shitty lag, and lots of
hp so it takes a while..  10 wipeouts and 1 AoW kill > 11 tormax kills

One thing we weren't sure of, was the pause on the cheal rotation.  For our
test try, we just had every single healer keep casting on the MA (it was a
very inexperienced cheal rotation group)
