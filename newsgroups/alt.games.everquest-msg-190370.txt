Thank you to those that took the time to reply.

Yes, this is odd really, I've tried the quotes and everything suggested
here, but this specific guild *cannot* be /who alled. I know for a fact that
the name was chosen specifically for this reason.

I do know that each guild has an identification number, and I'm wondering a)
how to find this number, and b) what is the command to search for the guild
when I have the number. Is it /who all 999 (or whatever?)

This is interesting,

Stevie.
