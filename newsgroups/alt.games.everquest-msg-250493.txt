Because they'd not be doing that anyway. They said they would be
facillitating, as in helping, players to make the sale. My guess would
be they'd put in a secure credit card screen like the one you resign
up for your subscription with.

Because that is shadey and messes up the economy in the game more.
Again, they are talking about just making secure transactions between
players though they should have explained that more clearly.

Which is probably why they'd not be doing it that way. SOE is by
nature lazy, they'd basically have no hand in this at all beyond the
setting up of a secure way of doing it between players. All they ever
said was facillitate. People seem to be getting the idea they'd be
setting prices too, again, I don't think so. 

My guess would be me and bob enter into a screen where bob selects to
sell me a lodizal shield for our agreed on price of 10 bucks. 
I see lodizal shield pop up.
I see Bob select 10 bucks.
I select 10 bucks.
The screen says "You are paying user bob 10 bucks for lodizal shield,
do you wish to do this?" Confirm.

Nothing was done on SOE's end but the transaction server verifying the
credit transfer as it already does for subscription renewing. Which
leads me to something else they did not explain more but should have:

There would be a pretty big chance that they'd do this the easiest way
possible, which would be subscription money on both ends, sort of. If
you buy an item It shows up as basically another SOE subscription
charge, for whatever amount you paid. If you sell the item, its added
to subscription credit rather than money put into your credit card
account. The reason why I think they'd do that is that it would be far
easier doing it that way thant putting money into people's accounts.
Yeah, the adding on a subscription charge to the BUYER would be easy,
but paying the seller would be a bit more hairy, meanwhile just giving
the seller subscription credit would be easy as pie and less shadey.

I see a 10 dollar charge like a subscription charge, which immediately
goes up, from SOE.
Bob sees that he is billed $2.95 on his next billing from SOE, instead
of $12.95. SOE is not actually making additional revenue, they are
just facillitating a transfer. Bob is also not really "making"
additional revenue to himself, but is instead just lowering his
subscription fee next month. But he IS basically "making" that money
but its not in a "make a living" kind of way so again, you'd eliminate
a lot of the shadiness. 

Bob's Mommy and Daddy see that next month their credit card is only
charged $2.95 for EQ instead of $12.95. Bob explains why and Mommy and
Daddy think Bob is a clever boy! I use my own credit card and don't
have a Mommy and Daddy, but if they made you input a credit card at
the time of the transaction it would eliminate most problems with
someone having a subscription and using mom and dad's card without
their permission.
