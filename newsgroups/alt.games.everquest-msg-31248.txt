Aviaks (sp?) in South Karna.
We have many human looking races, lizard race, and soon a cat race. I think
a bird race would be cool too.  Maybe a froglok would also be cool to play.
They could have a starting city either in (or next to) Guk, or choose to
start on that Froglok village in one of the 4 newbie zones bordering East
and West Iksar city (been a while since I've been there, so forgot zone name
and lizard city name).

Goblins might be my 3rd choice. Their starting city could be a number of
places, one of them being on that island in the middle of the lake in Oasis.
