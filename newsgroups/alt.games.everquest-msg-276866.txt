Invis and walk up to them. Perfectly safe at the Butcherblock docs. And 
Reasonably safe in OT if you avoid the see invis mobs (undead); I do it 
all the time with my SK who is KoS at both docks.

Iksar warriors are the only ones who have the slightest problem. And for 
them there are potions, be it invis or illusion (e.g. from ldon) not to 
mention a glut of casters in PoK, surely you can find one willing to 
cast invis. Enchanters get it at level 4...
