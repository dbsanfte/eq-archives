I am not saying that the game is perfect as it is.  Heck, I think the 
game is far from perfect, and there are many ways it could be improved.  
I am saying that people should be playing the game to have fun, not to 
find the quickest way to get the uberest equipment.  I don't play the 
game purely to get the best equipment I can get, I play the game because 
I enjoy doing so with the people that I generally play with.  The moment 
the game is no longer fun, is the moment I quit the game entirely.

Personally, I think that the most difficult things to do should be the 
most rewarding.  I do also think that performing the same thing over and 
over again should have diminishing returns on the reward.  To me that 
does mean that a difficult raid that requires many people to accomplish 
should reward better than a difficult encounter that requires one person 
or one group of people.  As to how exactly to implement it, I am not 
sure.

In the end, for me, the fun of playing the game is the reward I seek 
most, if I get cool equipment and such along the way, that's great, but 
it's not the primary reason.
