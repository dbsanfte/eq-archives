I disagree, there are so many guides that give you step by step instructions
on how to assemble a machine from bare bones on the web these days, it
really is cake (I learnt the hard way...and it wasnt hard).

Possibly, again, a look around the web (a tad hard if it is your first
machine I guess...but surely you can get web access somewhere :P), read a
little, you are gonna be spending some cash on this thing and will be using
it for 2+ years, surely it is worth getting the most bang for your buck (or
pound, in my case), for the sake of a little research?

True, but they will give you low grade ram, shitty onboard graphics,
software modem etc etc.  There are too many ways to screw people who dont
know better.

Some companies are better than others, letting you select the exact
components you want etc, but if you do that, you may as well build the damn
thing yourself.

Of course, this does not suit everyone, time, inability / lack of will to
learn etc will still ensure that the big companies sell there pre-builts.
But for those of us who did spend the 30mins or whatever to do the research,
we are rewarded with a cheaper, faster and longer lasting PC, that we also
know how to fix and upgrade.

For example:


512MB PC2700 DDR SDRAM memory
What brand is this? Generic I guess.

80GB Ultra DMA Hard drive
Again, what brand, 5600 or 7200 ?

NVIDIA GeForce4 MX420 with 64Mb

MX graphics card (basically a downgraded geforce), I would never have one of
these in a machine with the choice.

DVD+RW/DC-RW drive
What brand ?

DVDRom drive 16x drive
What brand?

V90 modem
What brand? Is this built onto the mobo, if so why list as an extra (and not
as part of the mobo listing).

10/100 ethernet
Again, built onto the mobo? Most likely.

And of course, WHICH motherboard is the damn thing using anyway? Can I
upgrade the cpu / ram / hdd  ?

Now lance did not list a price, but I can almost guarentee you that a system
with FAR better quality components can be built, for the same price or less
than what he will have paid for this, all for the sake of a little research.

Not that it will be a bad machine by all accounts, I just believe in getting
as much for my �� as I can :)
