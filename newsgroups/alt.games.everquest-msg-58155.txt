Well, unless you consider 1 pet a group, no.  Chanters, and any other
pet/charm class can only have 1 pet at at time.  Sure, there was a bug
allowing people to charm multiple pets, but there was also a bug
allowing bards to charm any mob.  I guess a bard with a Cazic Thule
pet is the baddest mofo around, it doesn't mean that bards are the
end-all and be-all of damage dealing.
