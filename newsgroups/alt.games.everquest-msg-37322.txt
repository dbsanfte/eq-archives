Not only has this never happened to me, I've never even heard of it happening.
To anyone.  If your groups enchanter is doing enchant platinum for people
while in the group, it's time to kick the enchanter and find another.   And
really, what kind of idiot would be dragging bars of platinum out to a hunting
area to get it enchanted?  They don't, they find an enchanter that is in the
town where they buy the platinum.

In any event, the point you were unable to evade was this...  an enchanter can
breeze or clarity, a druid or shaman sow, and the group never even notices
since it is a negligable hit to mana.   If the cleric has to do a rez or two,
all hunting, all experience gaining, all loot gaining must come to a grinding
halt until the rezes are done and the cleric has recovered.

Also, the stupidity of demanding someone give 2 gold to each party member
since they got a pp from a person...   If you're that concerned about coins,
you're in trouble, since the autosplit is screwing you worse than that on
every single kill.
