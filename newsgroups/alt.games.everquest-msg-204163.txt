Some problems with their design choice that come to mind:

1. Requires lots of extra bandwidth - which costs SOE money -
   which costs us money.

2. Introduces an ultra-laggy zone on most hardware.

3. Uses an out-of-game mechanic (24x7 Internet) to produce in-game
   rewards (sales in the Bazaar).

4. Introduces silly limitations (N traders per Bazaar).

A superior design choice would have been a 'consignment shop'
style approach which does not require your physical presence
in order to sell items to other players.  NPC's could handle
all transactions (and even skim off the top for the service).

You would for example hand your item to an NPC saying "I will
only sell this for 500pp".  You leave, exp for a while, then
return to the NPC to see if your item has sold to another
player.

If it hasn't sold, you can either take it back, or leave it
for sale.  If it has sold, you get your money (minus any
transaction fees).
