LOL, nah, they're hilarious but nothing like what I could get away with
here.  Although I might occasionally sound condescending (mostly in print)
most of the time I'm praised by those I help for being "so nice." ('course,
that doesn't get me a better pay check or sex, but at least it's something
:p )

It doesn't stop me from laughing my ass off out of their hearing on
occasion, though...when they make a funny mistake or assumption, but I make
sure I don't laugh at them unless I can include them in the joke (so they
laugh as well).
