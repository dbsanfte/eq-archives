Today when my group went to HS in OoW for some xp, we found that mob
camping inside the tunnel.  Sent warnings in /ooc and in guild chat.

An hour later, my group chanty needed to zone to shake stubborn add
and, you guessed it, died in the hand of borer on the other side.  I
volunteered to try and pull it away and got it to chase after me to NC
zone.  My pet died rather quickly but was necessary to allow cleric to
rez the corpse.

When I tried to return to my group, invised, somehow it followed me
back to HS zone and swiped more than 5K in a blink but I lived with
10% hp remaining.  Half hour later when I left the group for dinner
break, that same mob is still there, still waiting for victim to zone
from HS.  Sent the same old warning in guild and in /ooc.

Normally mobs return to spawn point or their roam path but this one
seems to prefer anywhere.  I was tempted to do a quick pickup raid
just to get rid of it but no one in my guild was doing war epic.
