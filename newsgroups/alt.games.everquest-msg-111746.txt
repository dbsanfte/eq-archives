God forbid a corporation trying to make a profit, eh?  I wonder, does Mr
Powers work?  And if so, how does he get paid?  My guess is that his
jobplace gets some sort of income from...uh...customers?  Or does he do it
all for free?  It's a business, for crying out loud!  And business' need
money to keep the doors open, the lights on, the servers running, and the
employee's paid.  It's really very simple.  And, believe it or not, this
goes even beyond VI and SOE!  Only the government can afford to continually
run in a deficit.  But even THEY have income...it's called TAXES!  Either
that, or I must be gay.  LOL!
