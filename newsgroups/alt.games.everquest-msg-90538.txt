Go to http://eq.guildmagic.com and click on your server. Voila - a (not 
exhaustive) list of the guilds on your server with links to homepages and 
stuff. Most of the stuff on guildmagic is linked to somewhere, so if you 
click on anything vaguely server-namey that doesn't take you to a 
guildmagic page should take you to the main web-board or webpage for your 
server, where there is probably a list of guilds too.

Then, pick one you like the look of based on their rules and charter on 
their website, their level/class makeup on their guildmagic roster, or 
whatever, do a /who all <insert-guild>, ask a likely looking suspect on 
that list if there's an officer online and bug them to let you join.

Or ask a bunch of guilded people in-game, 'if you had to recommend a guild 
other than your own, for a 34 druid who is interested in 
<grouping/chatting/raiding/naked-newbie-ogre-racing/insert guild interests 
here> which would it be and why?'

Then pick the one with the most recommendations.
