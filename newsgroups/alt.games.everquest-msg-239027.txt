This is true.  Any part of the epic that isn't soloable can be had with one
good group of 65's.  The 3 hardish to get items are slime blood of cazic
thule, which drops off Golemns in Fear or CT himself I believe, Eye of
Innoruuk, and Cloak of Spiroc Feathers.  I have been present for 43 Golemn
kills and have never seen the blood drop.  I suppose I could just be having
a long run of bad luck.  I'm not sure how the eye of innoruuk is handled
with the new hate.  I assume you just camp a spawn point of phs waiting for
the named to spawn who has a chance of dropping it.  The Cloak of Spiroc
Feathers is a Sky quest.  The hard part is a Black Silk Cape from Keeper of
Souls on the 4th Sky island.  He will DT every 30? seconds.  The cape is his
common drop, but he will occationally not have it.
    If you have guildmates or just a group of friends who enjoy killing old
world stuff like this for fun, then go for it.  A few of my guild mates and
I have been known to do Trak and VP and other old mobs that used to take an
entire raid just for laughs.  But what you are going to get is a fearsome
duck on a stick with 5 stamina, 20 int, 20hp, and 80 mana and a right click
effect you are rarely going to use.
