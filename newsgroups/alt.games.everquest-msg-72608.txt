I had some of the most fun I've had with EQ for a long time tonight. Here's
the story:

I'm a level 21 Wizard. Gordon Rankin from this group suggested a Staff of
Temperate Flux, but he said I would need help doing the quest. I went to
www.graffe.com, (GREAT SITE for Wizards) and downloaded a walkthrough. I
read the list of items needed. The closest one was a Rod of Bone in Lake
Rathe, which drops off a level 25 NPC, who has level a 20 pet. So I port to
NK and walk to SK. While walking from the NK zone to the Rathe zone, I shout
that I am doing the quest and need help killing "a stone skeleton" in Lake
Rathe.

Well, a level 19 beastlord by the name of Meowser tells me, saying he will
bring his level 31 cleric on to help. I make it to lake rathe, and we agree
that I will pay 50pp for his help (He didn't ask, I offered).  We zone into
Rathe. Both of us are very unfamiliar with the zone, and spend an hour
swimming form island to island before we find it. We find that there are two
Stone Skeletons in the tower, and will obviously aggro if we pull one.
Hmmmm....

So he pulls out his lull undead spell. He thought it would work as sort of a
harmony spell for Undead. He was wrong, but neither of us knew that :) Here
was the plan: He would lull one skeleton, thus rendering it harmless (or so
we thought). He would then pull the other skeleton and engage. I, meanwhile,
would engage the pet, which was an earth pet and was my level (white con).
So, we proceed with the plan. The fun begins!

Immediately both skeletons and pets jump on him. I nuke one pet, and both
pets jump on me. I manage to cast about two or three nukes. Meanwhile, the
cleric (his name was Belaldar), kills one of the skeletons.  Suddenly, the
other skeleton kills him.  I now have two pets and one skeleton on me.  I
simply moved away from my computer screen and had a good laugh. This was
what EQ was all about.

I woke up in Kunark, at the Ill Omen Mill (Where I am bound). The Cleric Had
bound outside the tower, and cast revive on me. I got to loot the item
(YAY!). Belaldar said that was some of the most fun he'd had in awhile. I
agreed with him. That was fscking awesome! Because of the time involved and
the addition of one death, I gave him 80pp. It was the MOST I could spare
without dipping into spell money that was needed. He reluctantly took it and
we got to chatting before we logged. He was actually a she playing a male
character (LOL!). She said that was some of the most fun she'd had in a long
time in EQ, and I agreed completely.

Hunting, grouping, and getting xp is all fine and good, and the game is
plenty fun. But on breaks like that, where some exciting stuff happens, your
heart is actually pounding in your chest before your pull, you make a friend
(we added each other to friends lists), and you don't even care that you
died... that, my friends, is EQ. That is what keeps us all in EQ, that
social, fun element.

I always thought quests were tedious wastes of time. This one sample of how
quests can go has altered my perception. This is one truly fscking awesome
game!!
