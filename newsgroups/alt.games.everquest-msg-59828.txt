Or be lucky with tradeskills. My first char (level 18 rogue)had around 
200pp, all i had managed to earn untill level 18 (just take all your 
plat with you while hunting, and do bank service, earned quite a mint 
trading plat for gold in Oasis, just shout about your banking service 
each time you plan to go to town).
He decided to do some pottery to make my own vials for poison.

After i got 120 skill i learned about deitys, make all 3 kinds. Made 
around 500pp on the resist and AC ones, then made Wis deitys, first 
competition showed up around 1 month later. So for 1 month i was the 
only guy making them, noone knew what Sands or Ro was for, so usually 
got it for free, or payed 25pp for it.

I made around 10K before the competition started, then i used the money 
to start my druid and let her do tradeskills, especially tailoring. Been 
lucky there too, every time VI made a tailoring change, it happened 
within 2 days of me reaching the tailoring level needed to make the 
stuff they changed or added.
