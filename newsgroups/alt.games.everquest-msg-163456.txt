I mainly did as much of the quest as I've done just so I could use the 
fancy "Disciple of Tunare" title in my sig.  Hehehe, maybe one day, I'll 
  get the next part. Seems to me the only useful necklace is the first 
one, I like using the haste when I'm soloing.  Had to do the initiate 
quest(dang ghast hearts) twice in order to have both necklaces but I 
like it.
