I dunno. Blood drops nice toys. He respawns in a relatively short period,
4 hours isnt a week. If it was an 'idol' style encounter I'd agree, but
they have every reason for shooting at Blood. I would, however, take the
position that that counted as a 'failed' emperor attempt and CiH had a
legitimate claim to an uncontested try on the next respawn.. But I havent
bothered to read the thread.

In other words, if the situation was alliance and CiH race, Alliance reaches
blood first, kills blood, fails/cannot take emperor, and this was done
amicably, CiH would clearly have the right to the next emperor spawn.

Maybe. Our crowd control squad makes good use of our hybrids without bane
weapons yet. Each 'chanter has a high aggro sk/pallie allocated such that
the *second* their mez breaks, for whatever reason, its tanked, now,
immediately.

I disagree. Blood should spawn gimpy '2000hp emp trigger' with no loot for that
to be the case. Everyone has a right to blood loot if they can kill blood. They
clearly dont have the right to the next blood/emp though.

We've seen this on our server too. I'm in a Euro guild and I am eternally
grateful we normally have head and shoulders time advantage. The feuding I've
seen between American guilds over cursed, emperor, even things as simple as
shard mobs beggars belief. I hate the whole 'we're farming this just so you
dont get it' mentality.

Saying 'shit happens' isn't the same as saying 'its right to cause shit',
though.

I dont think we've ever bothered with Sseru, and we're probably 3rd most
powerful guild on our server. I'm convinced we have a better time of it,
though, as the 1st and 2nd are constantly at each others throats.
