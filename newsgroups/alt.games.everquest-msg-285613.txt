Heck, UO is still going.  I expect EQ to be going at maintenance levels
for a long time.  But, I also expect WoW to be going for a very long time
too.

Given the planned 1 expansion a year, it will be a long time before a 
newcomer is as far behind in WoW as they are in EQ - 75 levels and 
hundreds of AA's before you can even begin to function in the current
raid environment.

With TBC, Blizzard narrowed the gap between top-end raiders and non-
raiders in terms of gear, so anyone starting can just keep leveling
right through into their 60's and get instance gear and end up at 70
with good enough gear to get started in Kharazan and go after Tier 4
armor.
