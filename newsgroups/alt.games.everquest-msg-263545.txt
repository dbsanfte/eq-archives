Depends on which Windows version you have. Windows98 has a 512meg
limit (Tho you can exceed the limit with kludging it you may still
have problems), not sure about WindowsME but I think it's just a
slight upgrade to 98. Windows 2000 and WindowsXP will use the extra
ram properly.

If you are going to play/try EQ II then 1gig will take you up to the
recomended level.
