I've been a dial-up Tiscali (used to be Lineone) customer for about 6yrs but
last month they 'removed' me for excessive use - I'd used the account over
their new 150hrs per month limit. I only used the account for EQ, no movie
downloads, no major strain on their backbone, just for playing EQ, anyway I
found a new ISP without ludicrous restrictions and carried on.

Today I saw this advertisement:
http://www.tiscali.co.uk/promo/everquest/index.html?code=ZZ-NL-12BD

Oh the irony of using what is arguably the most addictive online game to
sell their packages that will kick you if you actually use them.

Pah and to think I used to work for them too!!!!

As revenge I've registered for a free account and am awaiting a new copy of
EQ - stuff that Tiscali :-P
