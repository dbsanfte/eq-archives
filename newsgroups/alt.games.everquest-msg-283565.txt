Yep, I remember doing just that, standing there getting beat on with the 
attack button off, abusing the fact that a mob will always aggro on a PC 
over a pet if both are in melee range to protect the pet.  Pet damage, 
even by 49 or so, was so much higher than mine that the key was just to 
let him do the heavy lifting.  Meanwhile, keeping Torpor (well, whatever 
the "torpor lite" spell is called) on myself, the downside of Slow 
didn't matter as I wasn't trying to melee, and the heal rate was so high 
that I could usually canni in addition to taking the beating.  And this 
way I could keep my pet on the back side of the mob, which upped his 
damage output by another 15% or so.  Good times.

Too bad it looks like a mount is a year or more away on the progression 
servers.
