And whatever you do - if the drowned citizens overwhelm you in the Freeport
underground, DO NOT train them to the guards for help.  They will not help and
the newbies in the area will be slaughtered.  I learned this very embarassing
lesson myself when doing this quest (It's best if needed to train them to the
zone line in the underground itself).  At your level you may not aggro the
whole group like I did at level 15.
