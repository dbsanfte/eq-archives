So I practiced PP last night.  Stood behind Shali at one of the trainee
camps in Shadeweaver's Thicket.  Out of about 12 PP attempts on her, no
successes, 1 skill up, 2 counts of "Stop thief".

Bought a fishing pole and 2 buckets of bait, stood behind Spiritist *mumble*
in Shar Vahl and fished while picking his pocket. For an hour and 15
minutes. Went from Fishing(1) to Fishing(11).  Went from PP(13) to PP(13).
No successes, no skill ups, no "Stop thief". Interesting...

At that point, I joined up with a Beastlord and tried picking pockets on
various Gor Taku, Loda Kai, and Shak Dratha. Got a few successes, a few
skill ups, and a few aggros. I've only gotten successes so far when PPing
from behind, but I've gotten skill ups when fighting them face-to-face
(with autoattack momentarily turned off).

I'm guessing that picking pockets only works if...
    (a) you are not attacking target, 
    (b) target is a non-undead humanoid, and
    (c) target actually has cash and/or loot.
If (a) is not in effect, you'll get a "you can't pick pockets while
attacking" message. If you satisfy (a) but not (b) or (c), you'll get a
"your attempt was unsuccessful" message.

Only if all three criteria are met, then you might gain loot, you might
gain a skill up, and you might aggro the target. I've only managed to snag
coin so far. We'll have to wait and see what the scoop is on how PPing
loot works (can you get no drop stuff, lore stuff, magic stuff, etc).

I haven't been PPing long enough to notice how much (or even if) PP is
affected by target's level, or positioning relative to target. Sneaking
only seems to affect whether you can close with a KOS target, not your
success rate.

Hope this helps others learning the ropes as a rogue. If anyone else knows
any more about picking pockets, feel free to post...
