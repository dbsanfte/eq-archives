Why not?  Oh yes, because it's a zone frequented by immature twits.

Well, if you have an ounce of common sense and consideration, you take them to
the zone line, where you can be sure of escaping, and have a much better
chance of not endangering other people.   You don't be a jerk and train them
on top of another group, or innocent bystanders, on the off chance they will
be willing to powerlevel you by healing you as you kill it.    Whether they
were having an event there or not, you were still acting stupid.
