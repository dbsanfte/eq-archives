	Yes, and yes.  The only catch is that it only really applies when soloing;
if you're grouped you probably have Bard or Enchanter haste which trumps the
Paladin's haste advantage.  (By the time you're getting into epic and
post-epic weapons, 40% haste items are not that hard to come by, and Paladins
can add 25% on top of that.)

	Keep attending 10th ring wars.
