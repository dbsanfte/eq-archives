On *Service for Plat*:  My druid helped a guy with an equipment transfer, (back
in the old days).  He promised me 50 plat for porting over to get the alt,
porting the alt to where he was, doing the transfer, then porting the main
character somewhere else.  The stuff he was transfering to his alt was better
than the stuff I was wearing.
After all of that was done and the main character and I were standing in the
dreadlands he handed me 18 plat and disbanded.  Then said he was sorry, he'd
forgotten he didn't have much cash.  I didn't say a word, I just added him to
my *list*.
Just a few weeks ago this *same* guy was /ooc'ing for a rez at 4:30 in the
morning, offering 200 plat.  I was the only cleric in the zone.  
I sure hope he got that rez before the timer ran out :))
