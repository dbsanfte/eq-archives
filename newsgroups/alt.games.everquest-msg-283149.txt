I noticed that a few weeks before PoR was released and checked the in
game date. I'll recheck to see what the current in-game date is, but I
do remember there's a few game-years to go yet before 3221. Perhaps
that will be part of the next expansion?

Or possibly not. SoE has stated many times that EQ1 and 2 are parallel
realities, not directly related beyond settings and a few key
characters. For example, someone pointed out to me that in EQ2, the
Mata Muram invasion never happened.
