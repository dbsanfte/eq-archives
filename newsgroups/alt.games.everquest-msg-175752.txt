I've had lots of people telling me they made the early levels easier.
That's nice to know.  Thank you for the chat info as well!

| Most characters can solo the early levels these days - those levels
are
| MUCH easier than they used to be.  Also, if you want to find groups in
| the teens and early 20's you can go to Paludal Caverns - You'll find
| plenty of folks there, with all the good and bad things that implies.
|
| The Bazaar is going to allow you to find much better gear than you
ever
| dreamed of in your previous time in EQ, and incredibly low prices.

| Another source of help is the serverwide chat channel that folks from
this

it's
| the first chat channel you've joined use /1 to talk in it.
