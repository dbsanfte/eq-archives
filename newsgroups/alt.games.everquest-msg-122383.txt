hehe, level 10 ranger here....

made it in and spent a couple of hours venturing forth getting attacked by
mobs of gnolls in the red and running to citizens and guards and then
resting to get hp back up and trying again.......

shouted an echo down the passage ways......

"anybody want to help a lost ranger back to the freaking plains......" echo
echo echo.......

the only reply......

"take a left on main....."  echo echo echo.....

put the sneak to use and finally made it out by the width of an embryonic
pubic hair.....

my advice.... don't leave home..... but..... living thru the
excitement...... well worth it.  i'm sure that was what this was all made
for..... could be just my imagination..... but i was there and loved it,
hehe.   now that it's over..... gotta get back across the plains without
SoW.... sigh.
