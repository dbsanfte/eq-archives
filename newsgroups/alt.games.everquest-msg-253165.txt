The time in question would be called 'pre-Luclin'.  Back when Virtue and 9
(PoP) and even Cabbage (Luclin) didn't even exist... :)  The funny part 
about early Luclin, actually, was that breeze/c1/c2 -overwrote- KEI, of 
all the stupid maneuvers...  At least when I found that out, it was a 
friend, who forgave me. :)
