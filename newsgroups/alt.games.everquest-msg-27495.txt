I suggest you to buy a silver, platinum or velium ruby veil (depends on your
budget which one you choose) - the advantage is, you will not only get some
nice +wis stats but also some extra +str

savants cap is pretty light (also some wis stats)
At lower level  I bought myself a bloodstained mantle and won a
bloodstainded tunic
in unrest (wore this till lvl 45 or so..)

The best Temple quest item by far are the bracers of the revenant (still
wearing this
at lvl 52). Unfortunatly most of quest armor is quite heavy :(

When you hit 20, I would start changing most of your armor from AC to wis
(gives you more mana)
normally you will be playing in groups - and not meleeing.
Once you got 200 wis, you can try to get more AC and SV stats.

you see my equipement I wore at about 25 / 30 - most of these item I hunted
myself in
Unrest, Befallen, Beholders etc...
