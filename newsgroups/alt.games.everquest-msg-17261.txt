Look into server-side filtering, datarate.txt and battle spam switches
("enemy missed" messages, etc) for network lag, and clipping plane, screen
resolution and spell effects for graphics lag. For proof of graphics lag,
try looking at the floor during your next fight to see if it improves
noticeably. If it does, ban your group from using AE spells. 8)
