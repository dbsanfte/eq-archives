The only time I have seen this happen is when a person has been charmed,
then the pet will attack it if the charmed person attackes the per.  The
pet will continue to attack it after the charm wears off.  You then need to
tell it to back off.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no
character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of
your walks."
