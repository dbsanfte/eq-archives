Good post...

A large CRT is immersive in a way that a smaller LCD cannot be.

I have a 20 inch Trinitron that I use for my non-gaming and home-gaming use.
It runs pretty well, and the contrast ratio and refresh is pretty decent
with the P4-1700 and GF4Ti4200 that I have for my at-home box.

My LAN box is a Duron 1200 mini-tower with a PNY GF3Ti200 card and a
Viewsonic LG150 LCD screen. It's reasonably fast, the refresh is good for an
analog input LCD, and I still run at 1024*768 resolution at 32BPP... it
doesn't have the contrast of a CRT, nor the color range, but for what it is
capable is dead-on focus and no geometry issues. Works well enough for me...

Besides, it's not the monitor, it's the nut behind the wheel that makes all
the difference, no matter that the technology is behind it...
