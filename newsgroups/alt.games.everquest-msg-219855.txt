Over 20 years of bad policy.  Agreed.

Got to disagree.  We have the weakest unions (least benefits plus pay) of
the industrialized world, with a total union enrollment of about 12pct of
the labor force.  Most of our unions *are* concentrated in the old line
manufacturing industries and production.

It's cheaper to produce overseas because the cost of living and standards of
living are so low.  Unless you consider EPA regulations, consumer protection
and employee safety to be over regulation, of course.

I agree completely.  I never said that W caused the job losses, just as
Hoover did not cause the losses of the early 30s.  It is up to him to
implement policies that will help the economy to rebound, though, not just
make a few fat cats at Halliburton richer.  The economy was slowing down 4
years ago and getting ready for a decline (overvalued stocks were the
precipitating factor in the massive drop in the economy as evidenced (imo)
by the almost continuous spending by the private sector).
