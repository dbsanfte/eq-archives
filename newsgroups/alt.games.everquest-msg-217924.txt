I wouldn't consider it fluff.  One of the things I liked at higher levels in
EQ was on raids, being able to turn off all names and still tell people
apart because they looked difference, due to equipment differences.  At low
levels, when all race X class Y's have the exact same equipment, that
doesn't work.

It would be cool to be able to recognize people just by appearance from day
one.
