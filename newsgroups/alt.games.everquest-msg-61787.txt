Well, a set of lockpicks comes in handy...you can open then entrance
to the Hole.  Handy when you've got a big shaman inside who wants to
come out to SOW you, but is having trouble getting through the gap
(and since this is corpse recovery, no one has components for EB,
making it easy to die trying to get through the gap).  (With a 50+ SOW
on, you can just stay in hide/sneak all the time and still move fast
enough to get things done quickly).

I don't know what skill that lock requires, but my 11 rogue can do it.
