>Anyone else pick this up?

No.  But I'm seriously considering it.  I think it would be funny as hell to
figure in people going LD or newbies running a train to the zone.  Not to
mention all the rolls to see if the monsters we want to hunt are camped.  Me
and my friends are sick enough to figure in stuff like that lol.

>1. It is indeed similar to D&D 3e (which was to be expected, since it uses
>the same system).

I'll refrain from saying anything about that. *shudder*

>2. It looks like it goes up to level 30.

And if it's anthing like the game we'll have to play the RPG 6 hours a day 7
days a week to get out character there lol.  And THEN bitch and moan about how
we can't level any higher (How would we get to the plains?) hehe.

>3. The magic system is mana based, like EQ. 

So once our mage is OOM would we make  him hold a book in front of his face
until he had mana?
