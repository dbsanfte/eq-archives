I wonder how much of this will be changed, due to the whinefest sure to
begin.  With that in mind... I guess it's not as bad as I first thought.  I
guess we'll see what happens.

I said it many times before.  The wizards needed to expect this, and once it
happened, they would have nobody except themselves to blame.  Every time it
was used negatively and got bad publicity... despite thier insistance that
manaburn would not be changed, Verant had to take notice.  And it just kept
on coming...

I guess this one all depends on how good a job they do of retuning all of
the ubermob encounters.   I can think of several off the top of my head that
are / will be impossible without Mod Rods.

This one isn't really that big of a change for me.  Which isn't to say
people won't be whining about losing something they never really had to
begin with.   CH has always been one of the more broken spells in the game.
I don't know that this does all that much to fix it, but I guess it leaves
them room to add in "Upgraded CH" at level 65, which  heals a full 10,000
; )

No secret that I've posted in the past that I thought the monk defensive
bonuses were out of whack.  I guess this means someone agreed with me.

As someone else once posted... let the whine fest begin.  (Don't look to me
for too many responses though, just a few hours from when that letter was
posted, and I'm already sick of hearing the bitching about it.)
