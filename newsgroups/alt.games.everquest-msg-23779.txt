> advertisement/invitation, etc.)
I think that any guild that adverstises is a guild I dont want to be in. If
you have to get members, I would do it through tells. It gives me the idea
that if it needs to recruit using /ooc that it has a bad lack of members for
some reason or another.

A guilds key to success? Encourage members to group together, have REAL
raids, uphold polices/rules. Show a togetherness of the guild and stability.

> 4.  What type of services should a guild offer you the member?
A guild doesn't have to "offer" anything to their members expect a good
time.

> 5.  What features should the guild offer on their website?
I think a big part is showing the rules, polices and what not that a guild
has. I would also create an appliaction for a guild.

A GREAT example of how a guild should be (IMO anyhow) is
