I never use the new Models either.  I have 512 RAM Geforece3  TI 500
video card though my processor is only a 500 MHZ P3.  With all the
models on game is too slow.  I turn leave them off.  Most of the
time I have 3d sky off too(did this for my first planes raid and
mostly just leave it).  I would rather have a smooth running game
over a lot of nice looking bad running graphics.
