Oh, and one more post to answer your ridiculous claim I am being alarmist.
What IS an alarmist? Someone who is "Chicken Little"? The same person you
would have called Chicken little prior to the 11th has you been informed 4
jetliners would be hijacked and flown into particular American locations?
You simply expect myself and others to sit back and not plan for the worst
after you yourself admit the above? Many of us have CHILDREN. If it was just
our own hides to worry about, we might be able to afford your less than
sober advice, but we must take the worst case scenario and do the best we
can with it. If you disagree, that's your option, but remember, if something
does happen, and something that has been posted could have made a
difference, your dumb ass post might have prevented it. All the government
offers is KISS YOUR ASS GOODBYE WITH NO OTHER ADVICE TO SURVIVE.
