(Actually, I'm looking forward to the Froggies as PCs. May make one myself,
in fact)

But....

1. There are going to be a ton of PCs running around with variations of
Kermit and Ribbit as a name.

2. Frogloks don't die....they CROAK! (I bet a LOT of mileage will get made
out of that......)

3. They can't be any of classes I'd be more likely to play one as (so I'll
probably go for a Shaman or Paladin). For the record, I'd like to be able to
play a Froglok Monk (WE NEED MORE RACES THAT CAN BE MONKS, DAGNABBIT!) or
Bard.
