A druid can get at most 5 melee out of a place like this, while one wizard
can get them all out.  This is like the difference between a bard or necro
as mezzer and an enchanter mezzer, or between a bard or druid tracker and a
ranger tracker; specialized abilities that more than one class can handle in
small chunks, but really one class is much better at.

For a raid, you can have one druid per group, heck, since casters can gate,
one druid per every two groups... or you can bring one wizard.

What I can't believe is that there are any melee in a guild so close to Uber
as Monual's that don't have one of the many gate potions or an OT hammer on
them.  I suppose this is an effect of POP graveyards, its now simpler to
just die and wait 10 minutes than to worry about keeping a thurg gate potion
on hand, or go to the expense of an alchemist gate potion, or the bother of
getting OT faction for the hammer.

Since the next sentence was "So we have a bunch of melee that are stranded
here.  Nothing left to do but to have them kill each other and wait for the
corpses to pop at the graveyard." there isn't going to be any exp lost on
the deaths, except I hope at least one gater stayed to kill the last melee
standing!
