Why on earth would you wait till 40 to do ulthorks?  I'm happily
soloing em at 30, and was at 29.  The warriors are hit or miss..
because I can't tell slightly red from deeper red, I think.  I'm
happy that they introduced cyan to differentiate from the
exp/non exp green, now how about orange to differentiate
from the hopelessly red?

Hunters, on the other hand, are blue to yellow at 30, and
were white to red at 29, that makes them level 29 to 33.

In addition, the Walrus run blue to yellow in a way that
makes me think they are 27 to 31.

Sure, not everyone is a godlike soloer, but I can think of
no reason a partnership or group in the very low thirties
can't happily hunt the north shore.

Ulthorks drop Ulthork hide armor, leather class wearable
with decent AC and stat adjustments that are amusing,
each positive matched with a negative in another stat.
Classic are the bracers, +1 wis -1 int.  Also some SK
gloves, +3 int -3cha (don't get excited necromancers,
Leather or better classes only) really decent healer arms
and so forth.  You also get a selection of velium weapons,
vendor at 5pp or player at under 10pp they move pretty
well.  Lets see, what else.  Walrus drop the Walrus
Tooth, a 6/22 piercer +3 str and +3 sta, and the
HQ walrus hide which someone was buying at 10pp each.
Oh, and the Ulthork Tusks, which retail easily for 50pp
but which are probably better banked for the Othmir
Lottery.

Oh, and a party in the very low single digits can do
pretty well there too, those snow bunnies are great
exp at level 3 to 5.
