My personal recommendation is to start with a warrior.  Why?  because it's
the easiest class to play at low levels.  Play around for a bit just to
learn, then move to a caster (dwarf cleric or DE Wizard would be best).
This way you learn what casters do.  After that, go to what you want.  You
can try each of them for a couple of hours. You don't need to be proficient
of level up.  Just learn the basics.  You'll be happy you did.
