Hmmmm, well that sucks.  I really can't think of what I would want 100k 
for, other than to buy a gnome mask.  I guess I could pay a therapist to 
get over my illusion obsession.

Hey now, I had been logged off and asleep for hours before any of that 
happened.  I'm not even sure what happened, other than that Ragefire 
seemed to eat about 100 people before he was finally brought down.  That's
