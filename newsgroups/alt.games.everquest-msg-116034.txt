They have had 30-40 people at times tho too (and not killed any of the
"bigger" mobs)

With 24 people of various classes, my guild could easily clear all of PoA
(as could a lot of others im very sure)

I had fun reading it.. but all it really is, is magicians using twice the
number of people "required" to clear those mobs...

Doesn't really prove mages "raid usage" to me
