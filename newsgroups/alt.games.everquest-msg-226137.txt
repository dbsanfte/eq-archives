Ive also noticed a distribution pattern in Collect missions (at least
in Miragul's). It seems the drop density is higher nearer the mission
entrance. The last one we did the drops were VERY frequent when we
started. Early on in the mission, we took a particular branch in the
dungeon. We had gotten 20 of 29 in 30 mins and the deeper we got, the
less frequent we got the drops to the point of NONE dropping in around
15 kills. Then my wife suggested we go back to that early branch and
continue. And sure enough, we got the final 9 in the next 10 kills.
