No, its a cruel joke to deny it to them.  Luckily at this point its
not so much a cruel joke as it once was, in that you don't see
many people starting up half elf smiths only to find after hours
of carpal tunnel inducing labor that there is no use for them...
when cultural stuff was first introduced the half elf smiths
went from "just as good as anyone else" to "Grr, can't do the
really nice crap... that noone wants.  By the time we got
to "the really really nice crap that a few people can afford
and most would take if offered free" there weren't any half
elf smiths out there who didn't already know they would
never be anything but "also rans"

If you want to smith, make a mule of the correct race, push
his smithing stat up thru the roof on character generation,
then twink him out with more gear for that one stat, plus
smithing enhancer gear.  Have him make cultural armor
that your half elf can wear.  Heck, get funny, and trade
pieces with other cultural smiths so you can deck out
your half elf in a variety of culturals.

Frankly, paladins (at least ones not designed as smiths
from the beginning) don't make very good smiths, they
start with a relatively low wisdom and rarely really
get the gear to push it to the extreme.  Plus they can't
Gate, which makes some of the running around chores
impractical anyway.

I say it shouldn't be an option, though.  All dwarf females should have proper
beards, not run around naked as if they were hobbits or something.  Have
some respect for your culture!  At a minimum, dwarf females without beards
should be unable to make brellium, underfoot, or Dwarven armors.

Monks are also a broken class, or as you put it, overpowered.  They should
not be able to accept damage as well as a warrior, plus do damage as well
as a ranger.  There should be a tradeoff involved!  Luckily at the top end
they are no longer as good at taking damage, but one of my pet peeves about
this game is the idea that balance doesn't matter at all levels, just at the
high end.

Good, now start preaching the gospel according to Brell to your
raid leaders.  It might help to hand them a sacremental beer to

Yes, overpowered.  I mean "broken" not in the sense that they are crippled,
but in the sense that they have something that screws up the balance of
the game.  CHeal at 39...well, CHeal was a stupid spell to have in the
original game.  Max level was 50, and there really wasn't a lot of +HP gear
out there either.  Like as not a CHeal hit for 2000 points, hardly the model
of mana efficiency.  And the casting time... so long when most mobs
didn't live all that long to begin with.  Adding 10 more levels to the game,
though, turned CHeal into a nightmare.  Adding more and more HP items
only makes it worse.  What they could have done... should have done
in my opinion, would be to make CHeal work as it does now, only with
a much lower cap.  Say "complete" was equal to 3000 hp instead of
10000 hp.  Clerics would still have a bar non best heal in the game...
but it wouldn't be the end all be all heal.  Its slow, after all, and not
astoundingly mana efficient if its "only" hitting for 3000.  Instead they
are now giving druids and shamans a heal that works like a fixed (nerfed)
CHeal would have, because they were forced to buff the Brell out of
new mobs and encounters to take CHeal into account, and that made
ordinary heals insignificant.

Well, you might argue that.  But the vision has clerics, druids, and shaman as
healer classes, and paladins and rangers as secondary healing classes.  If you
ignore CHeal, this progression even works... well, except that rangers are
utter jokes in the healing department, better off learning to bandage well.

I'm forced to side with you though, on consideration.  Druids and shamans
are not cleric level healers.  Even without CHeal they aren't.  They
are, however, quite good killing machines, plus healers.  Why are paladins,
inferior killing machines, also inferior healers?  If you were better healers,
you could solo well.  Wouldnt' break the game, plenty of other classes solo
well.  Druids and shaman aren't accepted into groups on the strength of their
healing abilities anyway, not often anyway.  So you wouldnt' be stealing thier
thunder.

I think you overestimate wizards here.  By and large they aren't a very
important class, I've never had a raid leader scream out "forget the
chanter, save the wizards!" or for that matter "forget the warrior" or
"forget the cleric"

Noone, in fact, has ever suggested to me to save wizards over any other
class, except in a group situation where we had decided to evac out.

Wizards do good burst damage.  This is handy for killing a mob.  But its
not all that handy for killing a string of mobs one after another for an
extended period of time.  They also have good PBAoE damage output,
enabling the obscenely powerful AE group, and snare and AE nukes
enabling quadding, but both of these are plans for killing high numbers
of low level mobs, not so useful for killing high level mobs.  Since the
recent exp patch (and patch to the exp patch) groups capable of
killing higher level mobs are looking at better exp than low mob groups,
in general, probably not enough to offset the massive slaughter, but
at least raising other kinds of groups closer to either form of AE plan.

If this is true, its a massive nerf of your class, killing one of its key
abilities.
Unannounced, not mentioned by anyone, I'd suggest that its a bug rather
than a deliberate feature.  Test it out a couple more times, send in
a report with the clearest example you can generate, then do a /bug
and a /petition.

You may have to work on them on this.  You may also find you aren't high
enough level for it to be true yet.  Well, I can't see how you wouldn't be
better at SA than a comperably equipped warrior, but I mean in terms
of being a group healer.. you don't have Healing Wave of Prexus or
anything yet, and won't for a long time.  Another case of Verant balancing
out classes "if you wait a few more levels"... paladins should get a line
of group heals like clerics do, since in the end thats going to be one of their
main strategic contributions.

Manaburn is a stunt.  Its a good stunt, a powerful stunt.... but its usuable
every couple hours, on a single target, and leaves you utterly drained.  It
also only develops at the very highest end of the game.  If clerics got
CHeal at level 60, and could only use it once every two hours... you'd
see similar arguements that its too powerful.

If not, then I think you are missing out.  Paladins stun root blind, very
cheap, very quick, and very effective at getting the attention of a mob
focused where it needs to be, even if the mob resists all casts.  You
also have Taunt, and the general melee tools for aggro acquisition, and
should get good at playing every single one of those "trump" cards all
at once as fast as you can.  As I say, this is the one thing at which
you Can shine, so work at it.  Get a fast weapon with an annoying
Proc, and swap it in when its aggro grabbing time.  Research any
zone you are going to for the names of unmezable mobs, when you
see one, grab it quick when thats your job.  Get a good relationship
going with your assigned cleric, cause while the MA is killing a mob
with the help of most of the rest of the raid and several clerics and
misc healers looking at him, you are busy soloing one almost as hard.
You aren't expected to kill it, of course, but you do have to live, and
without ditching aggro onto someone else, just stand there and take
it while continuing to be as annoying as possible.  You are probably
going to need help.

This SA position exists in groups, too, again especially in group runs
into zones with unmezable mobs.  Five people on the main mob,and
just you on the add.  Have fun.  Don't die, that will put the add
back on the party!

Only because you think paladins are there to do damage.   You aren't.
Paladins are aggro grabbers, spell interrupters, emergency healers,
sponges... no more damage dealers than warriors are.  Yes, clerics
can now put out credible damage on your scale... lucky for you,
putting out damage isn't your reason for living.  Like you, clerics can
contribute credible damage now while waiting for the need for their
more specialized services, thats all.

This is certainly a concern, I'm just not sure how valid it is.  If you can
still get aggro quickly and still live long enough for CHeals to land on
you while tanking big bad mobs appropriate to your level, then you
still get your proper job as SA.  Best improvement for your class would
be the same one for warriors, lift the "soft cap" thats been discovered
for AC, so that Plate continues to mean something; damage mitigation.
With good all/all gear, monks, rangers, even rogues can reach the cap,
whereupon the only things keeping you on top of the Sponge game are
disciplines and better HP.  (*as the other plate class, I might have an
agenda there too, although at the moment I'm still well below the cap)

Yes.  Warriors are arguably at the bottom of that curve, though, you need
one or two but really have no use for any more than that in even the
largest raid.  Paladins you could happily seed in one per group due
to their group heals.  SK... well I don't know all that much about SK
at the high end of the game.  They compete well with you for the SA
job, but I dont think they scale as well.  Best use for one might be
as tagger, pulling one mob off the monk puller and bringing it in for the
MA to grab, able to FD if there's a mistake and he gets more than one,
or to help the MA grab.  Thats not a scalable job either.

Something I haven't touched on yet in the paladin's favor in small groups.
Root.  This is one of the most powerful spells in the game.  OK, its
not Mez.  But its close.  Like a cleric, (better than a cleric) you have
the AC and HP to use it well.  Grab aggro on all unwanted mobs, back
off with them, and root them in place.  Return to the main fight, help
kill, then go thru the adds one at a time.  If a cleric can function as
mezzer doing this (and I have, many times) surely a paladin can.  Of course
here we are looking at a popular spell line.. .but look at the other classes
who can cast it.  Druids, Wizards, Rangers... do you really want
any of them taking a serious pounding from multiple mobs you didn't
want your MA to face all at once? While a large group will almost certainly
have better crowd control, a two man, three man, even four man might
find itself perfectly happy to have a paladin mezer if you are good at it.
Hard part is going to be selling them on the idea in the first place.  Oh,
and training them to MOVE AWAY ITS ROOTED.  PS don't try this
on caster mobs.
