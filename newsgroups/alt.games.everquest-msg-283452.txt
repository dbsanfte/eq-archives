There is no frenzy agro for pets and mobs ignore them unless they are
attacked.  The pet may as well be invisible 24/7 as far as mobs are
concerned, since they only agro from attacks, taunts, and social agro.
In fact as a necro you can agro a mob, FD, and the mob won't bother
your pet since he didn't do anything.  (This changes, of course, if you
attack the mob and it attacks you in any way, you didn't have /pet hold
on, and the pet taunted or attacked)

Another interesting fact about pet agro is pet pulling.  If a pet is
low enough level to the mob (I believe he has to be green to the mob)
then other mobs will not add on the pet.  This is probably a bug (not
fixed yet I don't believe?  I have been semi-AFK for a few months).
The mob still gets direct agro on the pet owner but not if you are
feigning.  So if you are fast enough with the back off command you can
single pull just about anything.

Well any agro on the pet is agro on you anyway.  As you point out below
it is nice for cherry-picking a greeny but most things worth killing
are going to be too tough for the pet anyway.  And in most cases, if
you would get adds, so would the pet.

The Goblin Gazhugi Ring is still valuable as still as I know.  =)
