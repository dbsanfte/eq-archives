Quoth John Burton :

> I think the game would be better without this than with it

Could you please elaborate why? Is the anxiety of knowing that if you 
cannot CR in seven days, your corpse will be lost that crucial to the 
gameplay experience for you? Do you believe that waiting seven real-life 
days rather than trying your best to get your corpse back, or hiring a 
necro, will become the default way to deal with difficult CRs?
