Hi dumbass.
Do you write code?  On a massive scale?  Have you ever tried running a
server?  Have you ever tried testing the infinite possible bugs in a code?
Have your ever tried testing all possible bugs, then three minutes after
going live with it, the 100000 people using your new code find all the
unkown bugs and unkown exploits?  Have you ever tried running a server with
between 25 and 40 'helper' servers?  Have you ever tried to keep 10 or 20
thousand whining selfish little pukes like you happy?
Now, stfu, and go back to popping your pimples, playing Pokemon, or just go
off the fine game of star wars.  No, you wont find any bugs there, its so
much better the EQ, has so much more content, is a complete release, and no,
Sony doesnt own it either.  One less whiner in EQ is a good thing.
