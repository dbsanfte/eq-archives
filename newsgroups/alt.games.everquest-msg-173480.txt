But you see, Israel fights an enemy *army* not enemy civilians... Somehow I
always thought that was the critical distinction.  If Asswipe bin Laden had
gone and blown up a military base, while I would still consider that a
declaration of war and be all for crushing him, I wouldn't be quite so eager
to see him get his balls cut off and flayed alive like I am right now.  His
major crime was slaughtering civilians.  "Western style" my ass... what you
mean is not killing innocent women and children simply to (try to) scare the
living shit out of people so they'll do what you want.  Where Asswipe went
wrong was in thinking that doing that would make Americans run away with our
collective tail between our legs.  What happened instead was that America
got fucking pissed.  And no matter how evil and decadent you think we are,
it's a really, really bad idea to get us that pissed at you.  I think
perhaps we're something new in his experience.  Somehow he had the idea that
America had gone soft and wouldn't be able to stomach his tactics.  Well, we
couldn't stomach them all right, but not the way he expected.
