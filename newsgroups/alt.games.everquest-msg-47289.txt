Um no, read my posts for the last 3 weeks. The snippet you chose is a news
report, not my belief. Islam is not the problem. It is however the breeding
ground for the extremist perspective.

Sure, just like assassinating a president, flying a light plane at the White
House, umpteen gillion other issues. The sad fact is 400 million US
residents, no telling who will have a beef next either, and how ti will
manifest.

I don't go out pissing off other nations. Therefore I won;t take your
attempt to lay guilt upon me personally. So resubmit that in proper form and
I might answer.

Again, see above.

There will come a day when we say fuck it too... Which means one of two
things, your local overlord kicks your ass, or we blow you and ourselves to
kingdom come.
