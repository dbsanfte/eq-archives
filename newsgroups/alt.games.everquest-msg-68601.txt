It has been my experience that they have neither listened to the
complaints of customers nor taken action to rectify their problems.  You
think expressing personal experiences in a public forum to be "extreme"? 
Oh thats right, we need to quiet those who have negative opinions...

Um, where exactly did I say that they were doing it on purpose?  Or even
infer that?  No, I feel that they have been extremely careless.  They
released a product that not only did not work, but cased previously
installed versions to no longer work.  I never said they were doing that
on purpose, or even infered that.

No, you mean down with anyone who dare critisize us.  Sharing personal
experiences is not trolling, it's called venting.  Perhaps that concept is
lost on you.  Most normal people do it when they have problems.

My comment was neither inflamitory nor rediculous.  It reflected what I've
seen up to that point from the company.  Perhaps you've seen different.  I
haven't.  When I do, I may change my opinion.  

And by the way, the way everyone here has just jumped down the throat of
practically every person who *dared* criticize the allmighty Verant would
certainly be categorized as paranoia.  Down with everyone who thinks
different from us!  Silence the dissenters!!  One day they will see the
light!

I loaded it, it crashed.  Diagnose my computer from wherever you are all
you want, that's what happened.

Um, it's called venting.  Opinions.  Empathy.  Concepts that perhaps are
lost on you.  Normal people vent.  Normal people don't jump down the
fucking throat of every single person who has the slightest difference in
opinion from them.

Yeah and a distinct lack of social skills.

You've got alot to learn, buddy.  Learn some social skills, they come in
handy in real life.
