Daniel said:
}Actually the parts I was annoyed by was that first the first reply suggested
}using a program which is in all cases I can remember, suggested for the
}purpose of running EQ as well as running something else, which I said
}couldn't be done in this case.

Aye, surely, a tool can't be used for something you hadn't thought of yet.

}Second, they didn't look as if they were
}suggesting what was (much) later brought up, the idea of using scheduled
}tasks to start and then later stop EQW.  

I think your definition of (much) later needs work.  This is USENET and 
this thread's barely three days old.  Give it a week, and you might get to 
plain old 'later'.  (Much) later would presumably be after we'd all 
practically forgotten what the original post was about.

}Third, I simply asked if they had
}read the whole post.  I even began my reply in such a way as to hopefully
}NOT get the type of responce I got.  Something more along the lines of "They
}might be suggesting using EQW to start EQ, then use something else to close
}it." rather than "well if you werent so busy trying to get all pissy".

Well, dude, I hate to tell ya, but you sound rather pissy about it.  
*shrug*

}Fourth problem was that this reply went on to appear as if they did even
}less reading, as they suggested EQW for the purpose of browsing the web or
}other things which can't be done when you're not there.  They also went on
}to state that I can't shut down EQ because that would cause me to
}disconnect, something which I can not do.  I was sure I had been clear that
}this was my intention, NOT to stay on, but to shut down EQ at a specific
}time.  

Part of the whole process of brainstorming is suggesting everything that 
-might- relate, and then narrowing it down.  If you can browse the web 
more readily with EQW, perhaps you can also videocapture more readily with 
EQW.  Most people would prefer a solution that allowed them to stay 
online, even if -you- hadn't originally thought it would be possible.

}Then last, notice how neither of the first two replies ever came back
}to state what they were reffering to, to better clerify what they said or
}meant?

They're back now.  Probably gone again, though.  It's a shame you left 
them al this pissiness to come back to, probably decreases their desire to 
further help considerably.
  
}One thing I really dislike is someone who gives a seamingly random
}answer that sounds like it has to do with the situation, just giving the
}answer for the purpose of giving an answer, even if not the correct one
}(more like a random number generator).  The reasons I mentioned above go to
}suggest that this may have been what they did.

Welcome to the wonderful world of brainstorming.  Hopefully, your problem 
can be solved with the ideas you got.  It would be socially acceptable to 
say something like 'thank you', now, to all the folks that helped.  Even 
better would be telling us all exactly what worked, and how well it 
worked, so we can decide whether to recommend that idea to the next person 
with a bizarre problem.
