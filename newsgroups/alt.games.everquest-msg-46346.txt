My dark elf started with dark elf as a language and the ability to
only train human from zero. In languages I can switch to I also have
elder elvish but no skill in it apparently (other elf races who have
it can't understand me) nor can I train in it.

So basically you and hubby are going to have to be the SAME race in
order to talk to each other. Wow, what fun roleplaying.
