I tested it, we're both wrong.

The table data is in buff slot order.  CAST_ORDER is oldest (1) to
newest (6).  CANCEL_1 is which cast of Cancel Magic dispelled the
effect during the first trial.  CANCEL_2 is which cast of Cancel
Magic dispelled the effect during the second:

EFFECT           CAST_ORDER   CANCEL_1   CANCEL_2
Root                 6           3          1
Daring               5           2          2
Divine Vigor         2           4          7
Armor of Faith       3           1          4
Instr. of Nife       4           5          3
Spirit of Wolf       1           n/a        5

As Sow was the last buff up during the first trial I left it up and
rebuffed myself for the second (saving a whopping 10pp, woot!).
Divine Vigor dodged the sixth cast of Cancel Magic in the second trial,
the 7 is not a typo.

So it looks like the order in which effects are dispelled is non-
determinate.

Now, if you'll please excuse me, I'm going to go wipe the egg off my
face.
