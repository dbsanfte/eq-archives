Precisely.

No. I am saying that if a customer does walk away unhappy, it does
"NOT" mean that CS screwed up or did somehow wrong. 

Let's say I order a steak and it arrives undercooked. I send it back,
and the chef cooks it to my liking. The CS problem is addressed. The
resturant has no control over whether or not I am "happy" with the
meal/service. (I never send food back, this is just an example. I eat
just about anything put in front of me hehe)

Mythic made a CS decision without thinking through the future
consequences. Players will now expect (and demand) to be compensated
for downtime. Downtime is a very significant part of any MMPRPG. In
the future Mythic will have to make a decision each time they bring
the system down for updates or maintenance. If at some point they
decide to drop the perk, how do you think players will react?

>They gave everyone a little experience. Wow. I guess this shortened

>two or three years they'll probably play. woot.

Like I mentioned in a previous post. It is a slippery slope. More
patches and downtime are sure to come.

I assume people play DAoC, because they enjoy it. Free exp in exchange
for downtime looks great at first, but it in no way compares to
playing the game. Thus my statement that it "cheapens" the playing
experience.

>"Fatal mistake??"

I should have been more clear. It is a "Fatal Mistake" with regards to
the business model of a MMPRPG. Mythic has opened the candy store. By
attempting to one-up Verant they have raised the percieved benchmark
for thier CS.

For the sake of argument let's use the following example....

Verant starts giving EQ players Exp for Downtime......
Solo_Necro_01 can make 1 yellow an hour at level 23
The servers come down for 10 hours due to an emergency patch...
Solo_Necro_01 logs in post-patch and "DING! Welcome to Level 25"....

Does this not cheapen the playing experience for this player? Does it
not cheapen and trivialize the efforts of every other player that
devoted 10 real life hours "earning" the same amount of experience?

Respectfully

Val
