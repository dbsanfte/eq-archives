Thanks for the input.

Amp is one of those songs that I recognize the power and popularity of, but
that I go back and forth on using. Silly of me to not use it during mana
charge downtime (which I get very little of because I often keep it running
in battle and keep the casters close to charge as they cast). I definitely
like it, it's just that I've finally reached a point where 8 slots is just
never enough, and Amp sometimes winds up being the one cut (I've had very
incosistent results in how long it lasts for some reason).

You are correct that I don't have enough chants as yet to chant kite. I can
conceivably do it at 37 when I pick up my next chant. Charm kiting and charm
crowd control are two of my favorite tactics in the game. Unfortunately, I'm
reaching a gap in levels where the charm I have doesn't work on 37 or higher
mobs, but I don't get a new charm until 39. It's not a problem as yet, but
will be for a couple of levels here soon.

Fear kiting is currently what I'm usuing in a one on one mode. I usually
twist chains, screech, and Jonathan's Wistler for this one. I've definitely
had issues with the AoE side aggroing a very high level NPC that I'm too
close too (a 33 - at the time - bard doesn't like getting hit for a 630+
spell hit followed by a couple of 150's). Experience has taught me to be
careful where I'm doing my fear kiting. lol

I still feel I'm missing some possibilities in my charm kites, and chant
kites I haven't even started as yet, but I hope I get the gist there.

Time will tell.

Thanks again for the feedback.
