Wait.  The spell icons under my hotkeys are just the spell casting
gems put onto hotkeys.  All you gotta do is click on the spell casting
gem and hold.  It will appear on the cursor.  Then you just move the
cursor over to the hotkey slot of your choice.  Then to cast that
spell, all you gotta do is press the hotkey of your choice.

That what you're wondering about?
