Depends what you're curing.  RC removes 4 x 2 curse counters, RGC removes 9
x 5. (just numbers out of spdat, I think they're either a bit inflated or
the spells are kluged due to some asstastic hidden issues with regards to
curse counter implementation)

Sun Revenant's Curse adds no curse counters (uncurable, WTG)
Curse of Lord Wedazi adds 8 counters
most other curses add 9 counters
Curse of Ssraeshza adds *27* counters (better hope you have RGC enabled
druids!)

These are all just spdat numbers, insert standard disclaimer here.
