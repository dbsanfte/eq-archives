This bug is one of the byproducts of the locked encounter
logic.   When you aggro a group, you aggro the entire group.
You can break the encounter either manually (by /yell) or
by getting out of aggro range of a member of the group of
mobs.   So:   aggro the group, caster mob pulls up pet, pet
is NOT aggro'd, encounter breaks.   Of course you're still
in aggro range -- and probably engaged -- but the mobs
haven't reset, so no XP (or quest credit) for you!

It's a pretty nasty bug, especially where it's fairly common
in the armor quests.
