It's the casting time bar at the top mid-left of the screen.  The one that 
counts down every time you sing a song.  Until recently that wasn't 
there,and you had to watch your chat window closely to know when to stop 
and start the next song.  Or have not only good rhythm, but also the 
ability to know when you were slightly lagging.
