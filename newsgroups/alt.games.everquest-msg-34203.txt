You keep mentioning dead man floating but don't forget about
asking one of the several classes that can cast enduring
breath on you, or a mage to summon a waterstone. 
Waterstones only cost 40 mana.  Enduring breath is 35 and a
fish scale.  Druids (9), enchanters (12), rangers (22), and
shaman (14) can all cast it for you provided you or they
have a fish scale handy, considering where your going they
probably all do.

Cthulhu Loves Me

Cthulhu loves me, this I know
For the High Priests tell me so
He won't eat me, no not yet
He's our Lord, all dank and wet
