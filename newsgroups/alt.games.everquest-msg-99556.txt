Dammit Verant! Cut that out.

Some time ago I had noticed that new patch messages were being dropped
into my c:\temp directory. This was moderately annoying but I ignored
it. Now, over the past several days I've noticed that my c:\temp
directory is actually *deleted* any time I play EQ.

This isn't my system temp - that's under the Windows directory. This
is a directory I use all the time in my own work. And I do not like it
being messed with.

This is shitty programming design. EQ already has a directory of its
own on my hard drive. There is no valid reason to mess with any other
directory anywhere else on my system, especially directories the game
didn't create.

Sounds like a small gripe, perhaps, but I make my living with this
computer, and I'm extremely particular about where things are, and
even more so about *if* they are.

I /bugged it. Hopefully that function doesn't just dump into a bit
bucket somewhere.
