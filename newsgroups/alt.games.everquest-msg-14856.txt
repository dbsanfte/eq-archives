 Not really. For me getting to 60 was where the real fun began. I could
now start hitting every raid and exploring knowing my character had all
the skills and xp maxed. So I die a few times, no big deal.

 Some wont agree with this, saying you can have just as much fun at
level 12. I guess that's true. That's why you play it your way and I'll
play it mine. I just find the upper end game more fun than what it takes
to get there whereas others probalby reach 60 get bored and quit.
