    I'm a cleric - nobody's saving me when I get summoned except for me and
my DA. ;-)

    Miss a CHeal - yes. But tell me - how did the druid know to cast that
fast heal and have it land exactly between the times when the correct and
incorrect CH land? Did the druid actually count out the time to be sure when
to cast, or did he just spam heal and hope to get lucky? And now, the
$24,000 question - IF the druid cast during the right time and IF the druid
had 90 points more healing, would that be just enough to save the tank?
Trust me - as part of my job I've had to look through more AoW logs than I
ever want to remember. There just aren't enough close saves in a fight like
that for 10% to make a difference.

    Outhealing a DoT/AoE isn't going to happen with 10% greater efficiency
if it wasn't happening before. If you want to beat a DoT/AoE, you're talking
about high-efficiency heals like Healing Wave of Prexus, group CH, or
CE/Torpor. You'll note I said that I thought druids should have a more
CE-like spell than Nature's Recovery (that's the short term high regen
spell, right?) AND should have some form of low-aggro group heal like a
group CE.

    If my main nuke got upped from 925 to 1000 damage, it would be an
improvement. But I still would solo like crap because the efficiency of the
nuke was poor before and being nearly 10% better won't change that. It's the
same with druid healing. They complain they can't keep up with the damage
being done to a warrior in an XP group without going OOM. That's an
efficiency problem, and it's a big one. You don't fight that by giving them
a 10% boost, you give them a heal with real efficiency that doesn't step on
the toes of the best single-target instant-cast healers in the game,
clerics.
