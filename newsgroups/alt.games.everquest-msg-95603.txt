All true.   But I fail to see how it applies to the conversation at hand.

We were discussing the best way to spend experience points earned in any
situation, whether you gain them in an experience grind group, a fun exploring
group, or a KS raid group.    Nowhere did I mention how much experience you
should be gaining on raids.  (In fact, unless you play a rogue, most often it
will go the other way instead.)
