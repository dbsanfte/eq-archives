Due to experiments yesterday, I suspect that the mob must not only be in 
range, but you must also be facing it.  I was in OT, I'd run out and whack 
a mob, mashing whatever kick I had up and intimidate when I got to it, and 
then ran back to camp.  Invariably, halfway back to camp, 'you're not 
scaring anyone' would scroll by.  The mob was chewing on my butt, so it 
probably wasn't range (and I'd expect the usual out-of-range message at 
least once...) And I would expect to have succeeded and lost the mob at 
least once in a whole day's trials.  Skill's up to about 145 now, and once 
I got the mob in camp and the necro snared and sicced pet, I succeeded 
fairly regularly.

So I suspect you gotta be facing the mob.
