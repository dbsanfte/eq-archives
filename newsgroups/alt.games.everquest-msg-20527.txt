No, rogues have repeatedly been told that the reason it isn't done
is a coding issue.  It's not a balance issue or anything to do with
one class versus another.  It's been repeated to rogues (since before
Kunark came out and after sneak/hide was introduced as a combined
skill) that it has something to do with using a skill crossing a zone
line or going LD as opposed to a spell.  It's a known bug, albeit
one on the back burner.  This is what causes my obvious dislike
of the situation.

I have no class envy, especially towards a freakin' finger-waggler.
Feign death? Class envy.  I wouldn't call my simmering mood
towards the zone/LD bug with hide class envy anymore than I
would call the "You have entered North Karana...you try to pierce
Proon, and MISS!...Proon dies" message class envy.  They're
both known and stated bugs, and I just wish that Verant would
fix it.  Dying at the bottom of the pokey in Chardok because
you hit ctrl-esc instead of simply esc and had to go LD to leave
the game is just stupid, when the caster of a level 5 spell knows
FOR A FACT that if his spell was up when he left, it'll still be
up through a LD or through a zone line is just goofy.  Sure, it
may wear off 6 seconds later, but that 6 seconds is time to
KNOW it's happening and take measures (run, zone, look around,
etc.)

What bugs me is the fact that a level 5 spell lasts through
zoning or LD when the skill a level 60 rogue has won't...
especially, and here's the kicker, since Verant has stated this
SHOULD work, but just hasn't been fixed yet.

I don't, not by a loooooong shot.  If I wanted SoWs and
teleports I'd have played a druid.  I wanted melee and
backstab and evade and sneak/hide and poison and
instill doubt (especially since the "first-Backstab-after-
a-successful-ID-will-100%-fail" bug was fixed) and
Nimble and Duelist and Assassinate.  What bugs me,
again, is the fact that a level 5 spell lasts through
zoning or LD when the skill a level 60 rogue has won't...
when Verant has repeatedly stated to rogues that this
SHOULD work, but hasn't been fixed.

>Rogues have the best invisibility in the game by a long shot.

I never said otherwise, and agree totally.  Especially at
higher levels, when sneaking won't slow downJBoots/TBoots/
SoW/Selo's. It just still bugs me that after a year and a
half, I still have to sweat it out if I go LD in Cabilis when
I know that if I die, it's due to a known bug.
