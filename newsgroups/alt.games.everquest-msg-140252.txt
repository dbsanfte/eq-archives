Pre bazaar days I estimate about 30% of the items shifted, these days they
are trying to sell ice to the eskimoes and only a fool would buy an <item>
off an auction site. I would envisage the plat traders are cleaning house at
the moment though.

Before I started keeping an eye on player auctions I didn't even understand
the language high end players used when talking, but after seeing the high
prices items and the acronyms used commonly I can now decipher pretty much
all chat now even if people misstype acronyms and other dumb stuff.

If it wasn't for playerauctions I wouldn't have known an obulous death
shroud existed, let alone what it did and it's acronym. That's how I managed
to pick it up ingame for a song even though the bloke typed "OSD" instead of
"ODS". I would not have recognised it mistyped without the PA familiarity so
I guess the site not only got me my Necro but also gave me the knowledge to
get my best item so far in game.

I just wonder how long the bloke had been spamming the incorrect acronym for
all the while wondering why it wasn't generating interest?
