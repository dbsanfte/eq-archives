When I went offline back in January EQ worked fine, I've been playing 
off this dialup for several years now.

When I hooked up a connection via my digital phone I was unable to get 
EQ to work, but I wasn't too shocked at that, its fairly esoteric as 
conections go, and I'm no expert.

But when I got back here to my good old land line, I found to my shock 
that I had exactly the same problem... apparantly it wasn't the Verizon 
cell phone deal that was giving me trouble after all.

Well, I'm going to call EQ and see if I can get anywhere with them, but 
there's every chance I'll be sitting there on the phone for the next 
five hours and not get an answer, after all, thats par for the course as 
far as getting a GM goes...

So I thought I'd post something here as well, just in case someone else 
has seen the same trouble.

When I click my EQ icon on the desktop, I get a window titled Connection 
Failure.  Text inside reads "Could not establish a connection.  Please 
check your network connection or contact eqtech@soe.sony.com" and there 
is a single button reading OK.

A second or two later a second window opens, titled Patching EverQuest, 
text inside reads Connecting... and there's a fourth period that's 
blinking on and off.

I've changed nothing, as far as I know, same modem, same software, same 
OS, same ISP.  Connection is working fine otherwise as far as I can 
tell, I get email, newsgroups, web sites... but EQ won't even try and 
patch itself!
