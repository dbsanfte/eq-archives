This is what I found most interesting about playing a female character.  The
main one I played was definately not flirty or sexy as such, more
motherly/matronly, I cut off sexual innuendo pretty fast (helps that she was a
cleric, and claiming to be celebate and offended by any such suggestions).  But
having deflected that, there was still a wealth of difference to explore in the
way other people treated me as a female.  Ideas and tactics I wanted to try got
ignored a lot more.  Requests I made were treated a lot more seriously.  I got a
lot more deference, but a lot less respect.   It often took a different approach
to get things done; suggestions, questions, requests, rather than tactics and
orders; if I try the same approach as a male character I tend to come off whiny
and ineffectual.

It was also interesting  to see just how readily guys would run with the ball
given any hint of flirtation... or girls who were so inclined (or guys playing
girls, who knows)  Its a pity I really am not at all inclined to explore
sexuality as a female, it would have been very easy to do so.  But it did give
me a lot of insight into just how much unwelcome attention females have to deal
with, even with my best celebate behavior; of course the fact that female high
elves bear some resembalance to Gwen Steffani doesnt' help matters; the hell of
being trapped in a sexy body was driven home a bit.

Given that we males are always being told we don't understand what its like to
be a woman in today's world, I think it was very educational to be able to do
just that, even in such a limited way.  If I'd been giving guys the come on
under false pretenses, I suppose I could see how they could get the heebie
jeebies over it; sort of like going out on the dance floor with a cute girl only
to find she's really a transvestite; brings your own gender identity into
question and all that.
