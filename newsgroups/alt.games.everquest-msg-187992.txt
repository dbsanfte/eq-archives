Heck, I was shocked he had *that* much of a spine :D  I really wouldn't 
have been surprised if he'd come out and said "If it's terribly alright 
with the US, we'd really rather not go to war and all, but we hope 
they'll be okay, and... what?  It's not okay?  Canada, we're going to 
war!"

(Remember that puppet scene with Richard Gere and Renee Zelweger in 
Chicago?  That's how I envision Bush and Chretien ;p)
