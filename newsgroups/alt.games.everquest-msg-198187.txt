I agree.  They are really asking for trouble opening Tactics for
example.  I shudder to think what'll it'll be like with six groups
scrapping over every pit spawn (like Velks was a while ago, horrible)
and red con Diakus being trained up and down the stairs.

Changing the xp range back to what they were before would also help,
let people fight easier (aka older) yet still dark blue mobs for less
experience if they wish.
