You've given me nothing specific to respond to.  You just continue to dance. 
The only thing you've actually managed to make clear is that you think I'm 
wrong and that you don't seem to like me very much.  I even pointed out 
someone who has given me something to discuss and evaluate.  You know, an 
example.  But, I'll try again.  Where is the rhetoric I'e posted?  Where are 
the vague generalities?  All I'm doing is calling on you to explain 
yourself.  Will you continue to dance?   I think that's a foregone 
conclusion, you don't know how to do anything else.

And where have I failed to live up to this?  Where has someone asked me to 
back up my words, yet I've failed to do so?  You're squirming.

> I see how you are. Yep.

It would likely be just as much of a misconception as everything else you've 
said.
