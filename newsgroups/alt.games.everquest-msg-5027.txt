Even more so than normal, after a crash is when the GMs are busiest. There
are the people who were camping in a deep part of a zone, who died when
they came in, and need their corpse dragged somewhere safe (and probably a
rez), there are people like you with major bug problems, and then there are
the other normal things that the GMs deal with all the time...name
petitions, KS petitions, etc, etc.

A problem like yours could only really be solved by a high-up GM...the
player guides (for obvious reasons) don't have the authority or ability to
reimburse equipment like that.

16 hours is a long time...were you online the whole time? Petitions are
cleared when you log out, that could contribute to it somewhat.
