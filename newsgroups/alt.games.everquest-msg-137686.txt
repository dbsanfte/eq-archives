Hi all,

I just recently started playing my Shaman again and have learned quite
a bit since I last played...namely keeping Skills maxed.

I'm in the process of maxing all my Caster Skills but noticed my
Offense and Defense is quite low (~120 or so).

Any advice on where I can hunt in relative safety with low hitting
Mobs that I can just let hit me for relatively low hitpoints to raise
my defense skills?

Bah! Probably doesn't exist...but before I get back into grouping- I'd
like to improve my Attack and AC.

Thanks for any advice.
