Sounds like I enjoy some of the features of DAOC vs EQ.
I somewhat like the fact that fighting the same mobs in the same place does
give you less EXP, though I don't think there should be that much of a
difference (maybe 75% vs 100%).  I do think it should be based more on
location and type of mob rather than just one or the other, as different
mobs obviously fight different ways, even at the same location, and the same
type of mob may fight different ways (slightly) in different areas.
    I also do like the level effect of items.  That would help prevent
twinking (>LV10 running around in <LV50 items and weapons).
