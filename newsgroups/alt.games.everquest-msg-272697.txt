In a group like that, your primary role would be DPS, you are much better 
at it than a noncharming enchanter.  You should have been nuking as much 
as you can without stealing agro, while keeping your mana level 
reasonable.  If the SK was MA, you should have been able to pretty much 
nuke to your heart's content.
