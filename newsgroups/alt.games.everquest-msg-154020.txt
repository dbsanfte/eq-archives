Was it monk only?  Or was it all/all?

Rogues too need some nerfing, again the central issue is their
ability to get up to the AC cap.  AC cap is simply a huge
gaping wrongness in the mechanics of EQ, worse than the
old Wis/Int cap, worse than the recently discovered mana
cap... build your whole system around a rough balance
between defense and offense, and then cap out defense
so that eventually all defensive characters approach a
par because the best defensive characters reach a cap
while the worst continue to improve...well it defies
reason.

Rogues should NOT be able to tank even moderately
difficult mobs.  Nor should rangers or monks.  And yet
at the high end of the game, its quite possible for them
to do so, less mana efficient for a chealing cleric, perhaps,
but not impossibly so.  Monks are merely the worst
offenders because their limited defensive capability was
designed to reside in their ability to avoid damage, but
they end up with the same mitigation as a warrior has
on top of that avoidance.

I don't see how this is true.  Other massive shakedowns have
occured in the past without substantial loss of subscriber base.
For every person who quits in disgust, I suspect you'll see
another person who starts a new alt to work with the changes,
extending their participation in the game long past where they
would have quit.

Are shadowknights the new coming thing?  If you are stating that
they are currently arguably on a par with monks as pullers, and
monks are about to get that rug pulled out from under them, then
SK will be the new darling boys of the raiding community.  So
how many new SK are going to be started, how many old SK
shoved under doormats are about to get dusted off, new equipment
purchased, and brought back to life?

Monks will still be usefull as pullers in lighter damage situations,
with their superior FD capability and their mend.  They will still
be desirable in a fight with their high end damage output (a bit
less than rogues?  Maybe, but still high end unarguably) and
ability to ditch aggro back to the MA if accidentally acquired

What will be hurt most are monk soloers and monk duo people;
here any change in damage mitigation will be a serious blow
