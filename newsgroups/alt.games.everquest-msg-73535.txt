Ok a little confused on a few things about shaman potions... I see
Invis Listed above.. but see no recipe for Invisibilty (cloudy Potion)
There is the ITU (invis to undead).
can shamans make regular invis?... if not can the store bought invis
potions (bout 10 plat each) be combined in a bearskin potion bag to
make a 10 stack?  if so Whoot is my cleric going to be happy, and a
few of my alts too.


Thanks
