You will not evade me, "WBrownlee" <xenochryst@worldnet.att.net>:

>Tried to mez a couple of blue (to me) orcs tonight in camp and they both
>aggrroed on me. What is it that determines aggro or success??

When I use harmony, I turn on spell effects - if I see a blue ring
around a mob, it's happy: if not, the spell didn't land (or I am too
far away to see if it landed)
Casting a spell in the vicinity of a mob draws more attention than
just walking up to that spot does, so if you stand too close to the
orcs, they'll see you casting and charge after you.
Also, bear in mind that they do retain a small aggro range, so when
you pull one out of a bunch of harmonized mobs, make sure you don't
pull it over/near one of the others. Taking the one in the back first
is generally a very bad idea :)
