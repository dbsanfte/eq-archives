Are you stupid or did you notice that you don't play a monk?

They didn't change the NUMBERS for monks.  They changed the way that those
numbers work.

And no shit a monk/shaman can kill faster than a war/clr.  Slow MASSIVELY
reduces the dps on the tank, and since monks have higher dps than warriors,
they kill it faster.
