That was part of it.

I was also thinking about what lesson the beggar may have learned. Will he
think "Wow, I'd better not beg again" or will he think "Shit, I'd better not

Everyone has their own way of dealing with beggars, and if that's what you
enjoy, go for it. Personally, I don't let them bother me.
