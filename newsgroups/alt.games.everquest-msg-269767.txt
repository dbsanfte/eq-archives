Um, the PL'ing is in what way different from giving your
favored pal(s) gold to raise troops with and some choice
offices and/or landholdings to sustain said personal army
with?  Remember, IRL feudalism you don't have "levels",
you have soldiers, forts, foodstores, weapons, & etc
(yeah, yeah, countless hours at weapons training wil give
your better odds of living until your thugs take down the
would-be assassins, but it is optional).

correct "an xp reward" to "continuing rewards" and you're
spot on.  ;)
