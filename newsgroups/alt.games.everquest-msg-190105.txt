The first character a player levels up to 60+ goes slower than others 
just because they are learning the game mechanics, how to play that 
class, how other classes play, where to hunt, what to kill, etc. That's 
part of the great fun of a newbie, enjoy it while everything is still 
fresh and new. 

Leveling will come with time, so don't worry about it.
