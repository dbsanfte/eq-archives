Oh.  My.  God.

If that is true, that more than anything that has ever been said or done has
shaken my faith in SOE and its ability to realistically manage EQ.  If they
have no idea how much damage plat sellers have done to the game and are
actually considering a partnership with them, then that indicates just how
far out of touch they are with the player base.

I'm going to follow this very carefully.  I just hope it's not true or a
misunderstanding/misquote.  I really really hope.
