I can confirm having spent last night killing a few gnoll camps that were
green and a few green ++ that they do not currently trigger my journal, so
I'm guessing blue, and i heard someone doing same quest today shouting that
the green ones weren't having any effect. Other people were advising them to
try tougher gnolls. At 18 i don't see any that are solo, except for yellow
runecasters which kill me fast despite having fair resists.
