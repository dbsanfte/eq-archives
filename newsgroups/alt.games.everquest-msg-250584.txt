if you're 10, dump them into backstab

or, equally smart, dump them into dual wield / double attack (when you reach
13 and 15 , respectively [assuming those are the lvls])

most other skills, utility ones, go up very easily and you can do them
without being in combat, so you don't need to help those skills until you
need them, which won't be every day
