Help me out bro... they show the 5 or so zones and the pics of New
creatures....   what conclusions am I jumping to?  
I am only going off the info they are presenting, and well I still say
so fucking lame.... on those two feature alone.
Not so lame across the board that I am not gunna buy the product.
Just a little miffed on the limited amount of addtions "they" touted.

good hunting to ya
