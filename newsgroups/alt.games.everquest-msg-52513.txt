Umm my arrows get taken from the quiver to the arrow slot, one at a time
once the stack in the inventory gets used. It fails if the arrows in the
quiver differe from the arrows in the inventory. As to why use a
quiver..they firstly have a weight reduction, and that reduction feeds
back somehow to dleay reducito in archery.

Its a direct damage proc that will fire off occasionall7. You will notice
fighting with it that you occasionally see "Your wil is insufficient" or a
similar statement, indicating that the weapon tried to fire of. I believe
standard velium weapons are set to start working when the weilder is about
lvl 25
