Two points;

I think begging could be done in a creative roleplaying way. (After all, EQ
did intend to have beggars of one sort or another). I haven't seen it done
in EQ, but I have seen it in UO, more than once. The last was a few nights
ago, when a character dressed as a monk was begging for donations to his
order, to help the poor. His title of Despicable, gave him away a little.

The enormous threads that are generated by the subject of begging, seem to
be of significance. Clearly there is a lot of it going on. It would seem
then, that it is profitable to be a beggar.Why else would anyone do it?  How
much can be made from begging?  Is it easier/quicker to make money from
begging than it is to kill fire beetles?

If it annoyed everyone, then the beggars would receive nothing, and the
problem would not exist.
