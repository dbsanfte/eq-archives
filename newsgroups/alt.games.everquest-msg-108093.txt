They are on the original map (the non kunark ones at least). If they
were saving them for an expansion we would have seen them by now.

I think they just use them when they come out with the occasional free
zone, like Stonebrunt and Hole. But we haven't had any of those in
ages.

I guess we're due one, though, aren't we? Isn't there a new zone on
Stormhammer?
