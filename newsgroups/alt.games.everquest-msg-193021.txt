I guess I could have ask better about trivial loot and whether things
like Bat Wings qualified under that proviso. I did get that response
from a /shout question ingame too. I was told that they were trivial
to me now.... which prompted the question "How do people gather the
crafting items...."

There is an NPC in PoK that sells batwings cheap too. He is located
under in one of the merchant stalls as you enter the area where the
fishing pond is located.
