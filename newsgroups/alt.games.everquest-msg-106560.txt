True. Most outdoor zones this would be a good combo. But

The rogue might not get pummeled too bad since the mob will have
the darkness/snare on it I am sure. He will take a few hits and
just back off until the necro can fear again. Might not be too bad.
If the rogue has a fungi tunic and/or sow-potions/jboots/tboots it
would definitely be doable.

That sucks. Looks like everyone has to have warrior, chanter, and cleric
on their accounts. =) I got the chanter and a cleric going, just need to
restart my warrior. He was my first character, hehe , I went PvP with him.
LOL then I started a druid. =)
