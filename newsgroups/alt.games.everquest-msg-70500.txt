My guild has nominated GD and surroundings as our guild's zone of the week
so we're supposed to hang around GD, Velks and EW mostly.
I started off with going to Velks to check the number of people there. 49. I
left and decided on soloing Shardwurms for spells for the guild.

Before I even had my pet up and running another mage from my guild joined.
He got his pet up and we took one ancient wurm down, which taught me why
mages don't pull. While we were medding I got tells and guild-chat from a
guildcleric, pally and druid who just logged in. Going to the south end of
the wurm caves we teamed up with our guildleader (warrior) and another pally
and took down .. euhm... that wurm starting with V and has around 15k hp.
Got some whip for our druid.

After that we hunted Frost Giant Elites south of the giant fort for faction
and heads & toes. 2 more mages joined up (of the roughly 15 lvl 49+ in our
guild, 5 are mages :-/  ) later on and we took down giants at a steady pace.
We got one named one; it dropped an Ice Weave (ac 9, str +8 legs) and we
dumped it in the guildbank.

After about 2 to 3 hours of hunting there the zone went down. Came back up,
we reformed and kept going for another half an hour or so until we decided
to call it a day.
Helped 1 other mage who didn't have his first 2 coldain shawls yet to both
of them.


Not a very productive night for me considering I maxxed my Coldain
(positive) and Giant (negative) factions some time ago and the CoV faction
isn't going up a lot with the GD giants. Tonight will be an officer meeting
and tomorrow and the day after will probably be crystalline silk farming in
CC and griffin egg farming in EW. Yay.
