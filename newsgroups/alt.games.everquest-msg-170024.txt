He's red and a bit shorter than an Erudite. He usually stands sort of
hunched over except when he's attacking.  Pretty freaking ugly actually,
but none of his friends will tell him that because they are all
enablers.

Oddly, I didn't know he was actually a vampire. I don't recall him ever
life tapping me and I've killed him a fair bit. I always thought he was
just really into Goth.
