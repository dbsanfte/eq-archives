I must admit I happily used it.. but I never saw any statement that it was
a bug or an exploit.  Often suspected it was, mind you... but heck, I
was just having fun anyway.

As I had a mid 50s cleric long before making my beastlord, I was very aware of the situational
nature of the CHeal plan.  Using it neither too early nor too late, I could kill red to me
mobs all the way up thru my early 20s, far more efficiently than I could using the pathetic
things a poor Beastlord calls heals.

Further, get a high level cleric or druid to HP buff my pet, and I'd get fantastic results
with the mock CHeal... healing 2000hp with practically no mana cost to speak of.  Try that
chain casting Inner Fire!

No no no, you tank alongside pet till you are damaged, then back out and let him take it while
you heal yourself, then you slap a heal on the pet and dive back in.  This means you tank
alongside the pet about 3/4ths the fight but there's never any serious risk.  Its possible, of
course, to go after low blues and do the same thing with your regular heals... but I don't
think you can say chain killing reds while hardly using up mana at all was really
shortchanging... cheating, more like, which is why it was nerfed.

keep playing alts" plan)
