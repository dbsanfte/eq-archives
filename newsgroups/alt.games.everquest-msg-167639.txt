This is a good point. Especially once you can get the Summoned Hammer from a
higher-up but even before then if you get the right gear. Several times a
week I'm invited to join a group that already has a cleric because I can
bash and nuke really well. I have SCHW, Summoned Hammer and an extra damage
mask for nuking.

Plus I always save up some mana in order to be able to heal when neccessary.
As I result we pull nonstop mobs and pretty much never have to worry about
running out of healing mana.

I've never seen a group say: well, we can always use another chanter.

OTOH, chanter soloing is very cool and beats cleric soloing hands down. I do
solo but I only do it when I've got a book to read during the long
downtimes.

OTOOH, the summoned hammer plus good melee gear should allow you to
stun/heal and do most of your damage with the hammer if that appeals to you.

Both are good classes, as are Shammys and Bards. Pick which one sounds more
interesting to you.

Any tips on using Atone? I use it but perhaps you have some advice.
