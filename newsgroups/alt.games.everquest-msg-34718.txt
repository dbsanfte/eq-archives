I don't know if I'd go as far as all that, but I definitely think they
should include Jar-Jar's death in the opening scroll, so we 1) don't have to
have him in the movie, 2) don't have to have him in the movie, 3) don't have
tons of kids crying in the theatre over the pitifully noble and senseless
death scene JJB no doubt would have gotten, and 4) don't have to have him in
the movie.

I heard one rumor that Jar-Jar was going to be a Jedi in the second movie.
That, if true (I doubt it), would lower my opinion of Lucas to match yours.
