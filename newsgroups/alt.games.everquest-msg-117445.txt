No doubt.  Personally I'm surprised that any of these agreements have
lasted longer than a month or so.  That does not any way imply approval
of those who would break an agreement voluntarily entered into, it
merely recognizes that jerks exist.

to an agreement in EQ (or for that matter in RL), but you can make use
of the means at your disposal punish them for violating said agreement,
bitching and moaning never accomplished anything.
