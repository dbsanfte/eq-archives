    What game would that be? The top level "uber" raiding guilds I wont see
for another 12 months if I'm lucky?

> Warrior defensive tanks
> Big DPS
> C-Heal rotations

    Fwah?! Oh sorry I fell asleep. That sounds so exciting!

> SK's don't fit in any of those categories... keep laughing at those
rogues,
> whilst they do 5x you're DPS

    ok... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

    Hrm I hope that's what you wanted? Can you really do 5x an SK's dps? Or
are you exagerating slightly?

    Shout noob if you like but I've yet to group with a rogue who did 5x my
damage. Grouped with one who I had to actually use spells to keep the agro
off, that was a nice change :)
