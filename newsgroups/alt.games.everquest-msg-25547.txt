The Ogre city should be mostly safe, I think.  Just stay away from the
Shadowknight guild.. I know the Ogre SKs have something against
warriors...

You'll be fine in all parts of Neriak.  There's even a troll section
of the Forgien Quarter to get better prices from.

Cabilis will take some work. If your'e interested in staying there
(and if you're going to hunt in Kunark for a while, you should be,
it's centrally located, and makes a good bind point if you mess up
your Overthere faction), you might want to take up worship of Cazic
Thule to make your faction there a little easier to build up.
However, if you worship Rallos Zek, you'll find faction in Kael
Drakkel in Velious easier to build up.  

Seeing as how you're gonna be KOS to the good guys anyway, you may as
well take up worshipping some sort of evil god, at least you'll get to
use some interesting diety items on down the road.
