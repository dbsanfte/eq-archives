I really don't think there's any computer game that can match the
experience of having a live DM controlling the world and everything
except the PCs. The closest you could come would be to have a game
world with a team of GMs controlling every single mob and NPC,
constantly running dynamic events and quests and programmers adjusting
the world itself to reflect events in the GMs' "storylines". This
would be insanely expensive to do on a MMOG scale.
