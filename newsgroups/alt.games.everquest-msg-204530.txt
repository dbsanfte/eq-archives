Heh, the worst kill/camp stealing I ever experienced was on the Stromm
server, not long after opening.  So far, I haven't been KS'd yet on FV.
:)  Nobody insisting on "thees" and "thous" either (does anybody really
DO that, much less insist that everyone else who RPs should?) -- the
worst seem to be a minority of dark elf players who not only use
drow-speak but insist that any dark elf who doesn't isn't RPing.
*rolls eyes*

It is, though, the kind of server where choosing to give your characters
a personality and sticking with it like you do with your cleric and bard
and such likely *would* be respected.  The only real downside is the
one character rule that's still in effect there... but even that has
its upside; reputation means a lot on FV, especially at high levels.
