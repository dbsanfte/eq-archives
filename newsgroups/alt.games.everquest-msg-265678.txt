Of course it is. If it is impossible to predict where a named will
spawn, its impossible to predict who will get it first. If loot can
drop randomly from non-named spawns, then it's impossible to know what
mob to killsteal.

Your argument isn't addressing killstealing at all, it is against
bottomfeeding.

That's griefing, not training. You will get griefing in any
multiplayer game.

Is "the extreme" the normal example used? That would mean you are
unable to conceive of a game designed without the extreme, hmm? Say, a
game that had enough content so that everyone isn't stuffed into two
dungeons?

Inevitable, eh. *spits*

Do you know why it was extreme? Because the game did not have the
content at the time to withstand the population pressures. Have enough
content, add other things I've mentioned, and instancing becomes
unnecessary. Since instancing brings its own problems, especially the
pocket bubble universe effect which turns a mmorpg into nothing more
than a big chat room lobby for single groups to get organized in
before they leave the world entirely for their own, obviously for
those who actually want to interact with others in the worldy sense
instancing is not the better solution.

As opposed to LDoN's hideously predictable and static "crawls" no one
else can interact with?

I'll take your "anti-immersive" any day for immersiveness. You can
keep your pocket universes and chatroom lobbies.

Your evidence for "10%" is?

Oh yeah, you have never managed to provide any. You like so many other
zealots simply think your opinion MUST be that of the majority, and
therefore yours MUST be right.

More entertainment for YOU, perhaps. Hey, I won't poop on it. Some
people like the same thing over and over and over, which once you take
the interactivity of mmorpgs out is all you are left with. LDoN was
the biggest grind, the biggest non-mmorpgish expansion of them all.

I wrecked the game? The game was at its peak back before the fucking
casuals and other instancing proponents such as yourself wrecked it
with your incessant whining about things that weren't problems. And
that, my friend, is a fact backed up by the actual numbers. Once you
tards got your whining so loud that the devs started listening to it,
EQ quickly stopped growing and mudflation went completely out of
control.

So keep up your whines about how the evil powergamers ruined your
life. Maybe someday a dev will make the perfect mmorpg for you - where
you can sit in a room no other people can interact with, press a
button to get your desired monster and loot, kill it, and then go show
it off in a chat lobby. Sounds right about your alley, your sort of
"immersiveness", your perfect single player mmorpg.
