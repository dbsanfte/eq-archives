Every person is different. I wouldn't spend $175 on an item either though I
did spend $150 on a 55 character which has the ability to generate a nice
plat income for me so I can get a few decent items for my other characters.
My playtime is now more enjoyable and productive - it was worth it for me.

You cannot directly apply your sense of values onto another person. What you
spend your wages on would seem criminal to a dirt poor Loation villager. You
may even earn more then me - but I am single with no responsibilites so my
priorities may be completely different. EQ is my hobby and it saves me a
stack of money that I would otherwise be pissing up against a wall in some
bar.

*shrugs*

Life isn't fair. The good jobs go to the nephews and the great education
goes to the rich, not neccasarily the smart. Acid rain from rich
industrialised countries fall on undeveloped clean living neighbours. I am
not saying you should happy about shit - just realise that it does happen
and it's not worth worrying over.

My playstyle would not affect anyone in the slightest - but if they feel
somehow threatened or angry that my level 31 Ranger now has a full set of
Blackened Alloy and a BABS then yes, I too think there is a problem. I am in
no pissing contest, if someone steps up to the urinal - looks over my
shoulder and sees I am pissing harder than them - the problem does not rest
in that I spent money on a few extra jugs of beer, it's in the the fact
there is now someone staring at my dick....
