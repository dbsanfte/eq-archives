I started playing the Evolution pak a couple weeks ago and there are a
couple screens that pop up on start up trying to get me to buy LDoN, is
there a way to stop/remove these?

Is there a way to get my pet to NOT attack something, even if I am being
attacked?

Also on a related item, when I use my pet to pull and I am trying to get him
to return to me most of the time it seems I have to spam the "come" button
to get him to come to me and not stop and attack every time he gets hit, is
this normal or am I doing something wrong?
