Had a nice scare last night. Was strolling around EW looking for snow
griffons and my missing hair. Found one, killed it, looted an egg
(yay), went looking for more. Found a named coldain passed out in the
snow, hailed him, he said something about [help]. What help? I ask...
Oh, I have to kill some giant and get something from him, look there
he and his friends are on hill... look up and see a buttload of giants
of unknown level.
Tell my guild "Oh shit I am going to die" (my exact thought at the
time) and RUN. Make it to the rygorr fort, see nothing unusal on
track, keep going to GD just in case.
Looked it up after quitting the game, seems I'd stumbled upon the 4th
ring quest and that the giants would depop after killing the dwarf and
that I wasn't really in any danger, but being in the middle of nowhere
and accidentally triggering a cluster of giants was more scary than
the time I ran towards the entrance to the rygorr fort as the avengers
were heading out :)
