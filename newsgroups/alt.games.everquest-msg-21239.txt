I have never used expel summoned, was basing on the info at eqcaster.
If 210 for 120 is correct we get a pitiful 1.75 ratio and sound does beat
it out by a fair amount.  Also I did say "discounting the (quite valuable)
stun component" as I'm well aware that stun is one of the best deals
a cleric has going in many cases.  What I haven't done is compare
mana per second of stun... since up to 49 I had only the three stuns
and needed them all to keep a mob from moving a muscle during the
entire run of a fight, I never had to compare them.

I"ve heard that many times.  As a cleric of Brell, though, I can't help
but think that bad faction with Minions of Underfoot isn't a good thing.
if they open Plane Underfoot and I can't get service at the bars?

I have never, ever died pulling.  I'm actually quite good at
it, in a "outdoor zones with polite prey" sort of a way.  My
favorite pull is stun and run, which I would do even un-sowed..
wow is it scary when the mob resists though.  Lately I"ve
been pulling seachests in CS, which can't be targettted before
you are in aggro range, by slapping celestial on myself, running
in and making a U turn, and swimming back up to the group
with my HP bar dropping to 80 then jumping back to full the
whole way up.  Sure wish there was a way to swim faster than
the mob on my butt, but even with SOW and a 181 swim
skill, I'm chewed on till I hit land.

Not a bad grouping at all, 2 tanks (warrior, mage pet)
three damage producers ( monk, mage, druid ) three crowd
controllers ( chanter, druid, cleric ) a decent buff set
( chanter, druid, cleric ) a taunter (warrior) puller (monk)
transport (druid) and CR team (monk and cleric) as well
as the holy duo ( snare [druid] and fear [cleric and chanter])

Yep...or Great heal.  Nice thing about Remedy is its fast enough

I have used complete heal in some situations, but you need a -serious-
tank to do it... noone in the general level 39 range need apply.  My
favorite CHeal target so far is a level 55 mage's pet with full HP buffs.
SHeal did less than half a bubble on that bad boy, while I must have
been getting over 5000hp for my CHeal dollar.

With the wimpier tanks, CHeal is not only less effiecient, but has the
annoying tendancy to take too long, if a mob gets off a lucky full
damage round or two the poor shmuck dies before it goes off.  When
your tank is dropping in a steady controlled way, sure, there's nothing
finer than hitting the old Reset button on him.

I use one in place of gate, but two is for times when I can just chuck
my "do stuff to the mobs" list as irrelevant.  Normally I don't need
even one, as I"m capable of standing up to a beating for quite a while,
and have stun and root at a minimum ready to get stuff off myself.
Beauty of that is, neither of those spells disturb mez, so if my chanter
happens to slip one in there while I'm casting, its no big deal.

You don't use Stun?  35 mana for a 6 second pause that also casts faster
than the other three.  And it =====doesn't break MEZ======!  Using
a damage spell in an effort to buy a few second for mez to go off strikes
me as a dangerous game... angry chanter is something I don't want to face.

Only on gate mobs?  What about CHeal, you like killing em three or four
times only?  What about mobs like Cobalt Drakes, with their 500 damage
AOE that strips up to 4 buffs off each target?  If you chain stun with
stun/holy might/force its really not a lot of mana to keep a mob from
doing anything at all... with high damage output mobs I find I end up
down about 20% mana at the end of a fight, while I may be down
40% or more if I have to keep healing (more often this applies when
the nominal tank is someone ill suited to the job, like a ranger)

I can't imagine normally running both divines... given that I've cast the
thing no more than three times in a non raid situation in my 50 levels
of life, I doubt I'll ever need it twice in 15 minutes.  I do see the
need for it on a raid, where disasters do indeed pop up faster
than 15 minutes apart... but I look on Divine Barrier as the far
inferior of the pair, costing more (when I'm likely LOM if I'm
resorting to invulnerability) and taking longer (when I'm likely
being beat down by several mobs if I'm resorting to invulnerability)
Yes, it has a regen component, but isn't it a pretty pitiful one?
Don't know, really, think I've cast it once...and /q right after.

Hmm, I have used DA as a ghetto invis a time or two, pop it
on and run straight thru the gate guards into Neriak, so as to
res someone just inside.  In a previous life, I used to use it
to get out of Kelethin at low levels, pop it on and jump.
