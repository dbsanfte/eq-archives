I can't speak from experience regarding this aug.  My assumption would be
that it works like the spell Bounce.  I can't even speak from experience
regarding the spell Bounce, but I've read that it only has the chance to
Bounce back the damage or effect if the spell is PC-castable - i.e. you
could reflect an NPC casting Ice Comet, but not the specialized AE's from
high level mobs.
