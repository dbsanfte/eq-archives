I dont know if anyone will be able to help, but here goes. 

I had this problem when I first built my computer that it would crash
after being on EQ for about 20 seconds - 2 minutes. It was fixed when
I put the network into a different PCI slot so it didnt share a IRQ
slot with my video card. I recently re-formatted my drive and upgraded
from FAT32 to NTFS and did a clean install of win2k rather then an
upgrade. Now I am having this problem again along with some other
random shutdowns (blue screen physical memory dumps -
IRQL_IS_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL). This happens when anytime from when its
just sitting on the desktop to when I'm in the middle of writing a
post on a message board ><. I have disable devices here and there (USB
ports and such) so that every IRQ slot has only one thing on it and
yet I still get this problem. Anyone have any ideas? Would be greatly
appreciated, thanks.
