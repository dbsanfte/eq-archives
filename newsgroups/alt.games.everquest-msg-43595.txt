There's only so many gob-smacking weapons they can implement. I don't
want to labour for more pointy things, I want more intrinsic character
abilities, dammit!

Apart from the occasional bout of CR [1], a few locked doors and
irritating traps, damage is all we have. I don't want to do 20% more
damage but otherwise be useless compared to other classes that already
come with plenty of utility.

[1] Some people aren't keen to let Rogues do CR, anywhere. They'd rather
get the joker Monks to do it, or pay through the nose for a Necro to
come and summon it. Watching the pigeons die while hidden in the shadows
can be amusing though.
