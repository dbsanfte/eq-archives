I dunno about NPCs specifically labled... EQAtlas just lists what is
generally available from the vendors.

If you mean a map that lists what Monsters spawn where, or which guard is a
particular level, then I can't remember anyone doing a project like that...
and certainly not on the web.

I did a map of West Freeport listing each Guard by name, level, patrol
route, and time taken to follow his route... I wanted to see if there was a
'perfect pulling window' on Lucan raids. There wasn't... and it was more
work than I'd expected. Prolly why it hasn't been done elsewhere :o)
