When grouped with chanters I tend to make a hot key and discuss what happens
when the chanter gets hit before it happens.
Hot key says: Chanter under attack HEAL the chanter while I Celestial
Heal!!! NOW
Druids and Shamans are told when we start group that if chanter gets
attacked it is their job to get off a quick heal while I Celestial Heal.
This works. Now that I am 51st lvl I used remedy on the chanter and follow
up with celestial heal. I don't have to depend or rely on the shaman/druid
being able to cast a healing spell. Death Pact is useful too.
