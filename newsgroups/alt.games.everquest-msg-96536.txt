I usually try and park my pet a safe distance away just incase this
happens. I think I am going to try the /pet hold command which I heard
works best (they will not attack unless you tell them no matter what).
But as we know pets will come running from accross zones practically
when we are hit. I remember being the puller in a group on the Sarnak
Fort ledge in LOIO, and the pet coming running each time I got hit
during a pull.

Everyone makes mistakes, thats why there is a /pet pull back key. I
admit I have had to do it quite a few times, and usually the Enchanter
is not too upset and able to remez the mob.

This is what totally peeved me off. I should unsummon my pet! Ok, in a
dungeon and a good enough group sure, but..The Chanter did not want to
listen to reason, and simply hit Disband and the group was in the
middle of DL. It was classic. Everyone just regrouped laughed it off
and a new chanter came by in 3 minutes.
