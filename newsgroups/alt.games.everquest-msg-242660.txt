I agree with you, but there is one way that would work (and is in fact
what Horizons should have done) - make EVERYONE a dragon and design
the game around that. Or at least everyone is a race as powerful as a
dragon.

THEN it would work.

That would take a lot more imagination than is currently being shown
by mmorpg makers, though.
