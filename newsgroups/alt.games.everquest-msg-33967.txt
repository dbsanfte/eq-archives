I guess we're talking about character aging here; I'm too lazy to dig for
the original post.  Anyway, there's a whole set of problems here.  Excuse me
if anyone already said this stuff; I don't have the ability to easily access
the original thread and I don't have the inclination to do it the hard way.

1) Character Age.  Do characters age when they aren't being played?  Time
goes on in game when you aren't actively controlling your character, so it
makes sense that characters would age while you're away.  That, however,
would be terribly unfair to folks who can't play often.  Their characters
would shrivel and keel over long before reaching high level.  Also, what
happens if you have more than one character?  Even if you're playing one,
the others are all getting older and you can't do anything about it.  1b)
If, on the other hand, characters do not age when inactive, how could the
extreme difference in lifespan between characters be explained? (i.e. if one
guy plays sixty hours a week, another plays two hours a week, the sixty hour
guy's character will live his whole life in about eighteen months by the
standards of the two hour guy's character.  What queer magic is afoot here?)

2) NPC Age.  Would NPCs age?  If so, this would require TREMENDOUS amounts
of work, as new graphics are patched in to account for wrinkles, stats are
changed to account for NPCs growing wiser or more frail, new NPCs are
created to replace those who die from old age, quests change when NPCs come
and go, etc.

3) Permanency.  How permanent is death?  It has no permanence at all in EQ:
you respawn almost immediately when you die and the only effect is an
experience hit.  NPCs respawn within a few minutes and they're always as
good as new.  Once a character dies in whatever game we're speaking of
(someone mentioned Neverwinter Nights, which I don't know anything about),
how much difficulty is involved in bringing him back to life?  The answer
could be anywhere from "Automatic respawn" to "Abso-fucking-lutely
impossible, don't cry to us, we cannot restore your character".  3b) If
death is permanent, how do you propose to deal with the unbelievable load of
"plz plz plz bring my character back to life" petitions and emails and
whatnot that the company WILL get?  No number of repetitions of the "no-rez
rule" could ever be enough to stop that.

4) Aging Effects.  What exactly are the effects of age on a character?  We
know that in real life, people slow down physically, but usually grow
smarter, the older they get.  Would physical attributes be reduced
automatically when characters reachd a certain age?  Would the character
faces have update points to reflect graying hair, wrinkles, and so on?
Would mental attributes change?  What about  increased healing time for the
oldsters, whose bones don't knit well any longer?

5) How It Ends.  How exactly would characters die?  If there's no such thing
as resurrection, hardly any characters will die of old age.  But for those
that do, how will maximum age be determined?  Will the character just go to
sleep one night and never wake up?  Will he suffer a heart attack at a
random or predetermined point in time?  Will the player have any warning at
all that his character has a certain amount of time remaining, or will the
first indication of imminent death be the "You have a terrible pain in your
chest, you stumble and fall to the ground" message?

6) Legacy.  If a character has appreciable loot, where does it go upon his
death?  Would it all poof into nothing?  Could the player write up a will in
game, either before or after the character's death?  If there's no will, but
the items don't poof, what happens to them?

7) Offspring.  Could characters marry and/or have children?  Would these be
NPCs or could a player control them (or at least keep them out of trouble)?
When the children reach a reasonable age, could the player of the parent run
the child as a new character?  Would reputation carry over from the parents?
"The sins of the father shall be carried for seven generations" or something
like that.  It stands to reason that if Dear Ol' Dad was a necromancer,
Sonny Boy will have a hard time gaining acceptance at the paladins' guild.
Conversely, if Dad was a paladin, Junior's desire to practice the black arts
will be severely hampered, since no evil character would trust the son of
Sir Gleamingsword.

8) The World.  Do trees grow?  Do riverbanks erode?  And so on.
