I never automaticaly answer YES to anything.  I always read the info in that
little box, the one that says "do you wish to be transported to your bind
point?".  
I don't think it's rude.  I think people should pay attention to what they are
doing and learn to read.  My ranger / warrior often *do* want a transport to
bind when I am in POK.  Unfortunately no one's ever MGBing it when I'm
there.....
