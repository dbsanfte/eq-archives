  You can make friends and encourage them to hunt with you somewhere else.  A
surprising number of people are "adventurous" enough to join you... perhaps
moreso on FV, since people generally migrate to that server because they're
tired of "EQ as usual" in one way or another, and may be more willing to explore
and do something different.

  Still, you have to meet those friends somewhere, and that means you have to go
where the like-level people are... and that will often having to spend at least
some time in the "lemming zones."
