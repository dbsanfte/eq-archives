Naw, John. Haven't even started it yet. I was concentrating on the
Phenocryst Focus quest (finished! Yay!) and my portion of my guild wide
effort for the PoTC quest to get earrings for all of our members. (End
in sight, thank gawd). Besides that we were just camping rage for two
straight fucking weeks. (Goddamnittohell server crashes and resets) Our
cleric FINALLY got Rage to pop last night and I took her to get her
epic. Now I might start that one.
