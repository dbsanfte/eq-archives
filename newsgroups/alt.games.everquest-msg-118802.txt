Not quite... Those were examples of behaviour that was "wrong" in humans, 
but perfectly right for animals, since they are blissfully unburdened by 
moral considerations.

It certainly doesn't benefit the animal involved... In humans, an act is 
considered moral if it benefits the *individual*, not the herd. We're 
throughly disgusted by things like (hmm... must avoid Godwin...), hm, like 
certainl governments in Scandinavia sterilizing criminals and mentally 
disabled people during the '50s and '60s. It could be argued (perhaps even 
proved) that that behaviour benefits the human "herd" as a whole, and yet 
it's still widely regarded as immoral.
