Movement increase? like attack or running?

There are many haste items for attack, just to name a few:
  - Flowing black silk shash  (frenzy in lower guk)
  - Hangman's noose (hangman in trakanons teeth)
  - Cloak of flames (and fire-based dragon *& ixablat fir)
  - Runed bolster belt (Ice based dragons)

as for running, there are only a few items:
  - Journeymans boots (quest from hasten bootstruder in Rathe Mtns)
  - Travelers boots (Sold in SolB from the gnome merchant)
  - Sow boots (shaman epic piece)
  - Tinkered boots (tinkered item, gnome cleric and warrior only)

> also (more importantly)
> Regeneraation type gear ?

Here is where it matters what race/class and what you intend to use it for.
  - Iksar ceremonal brest plate (Trooper <somebody> in trakanons teeth)
  - Fungy tunic (shrooms in old sebilis)
