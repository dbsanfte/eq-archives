I think the most telling phrase is "I eventually got bored of it...and 
stopped playing." part of your EQ1 experience.  I'm *not* an EQ player 
(DAoC), so I'm not trying to convert you either way.  If you liked WC 
I-III, you will probably like WoW equally.  If you got tired of EQ1, you 
need to understand what in it made you that way, and does EQ2 avoid you 
feeling that way again?
