 >>> haven't you guys hear the rumour that the $3 hike is sony's idea to
help pay for a whole new line of servers to start for a different game? <<<

Um ... no.

Have you heard the rumor that the $3 hike is to help pay for a recently
added role-playing server, a recently added European server, a recently
added third (Legends) server, and a soon to be released fourth (free)
server?

Probably not, since I just started it, just trying to show some perspective
here. Honestly, we can spread rumors about how Verant suxx0rs all day long,
but at the end of the day we're still playing EQ.
