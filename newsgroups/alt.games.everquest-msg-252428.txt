Perhaps not.  But it's a reason you will hear again, and again, and again, 
until you're quite bored of it.  Why put yourself through that?  Just 
because you aren't bored yet?  Because your goal of annoying the most 
possible people in the least actual time, and distracting them from the 
actual content of your posts to argue over irrelevancies has not yet been 
met?

There will always be more folks to alienate later.  Why not try talking to 
them first?  Deliberate flaunting of the civilized and agreed-upon rules 
will not win you nearly as many friends as it will enemies, whether those 
rules are 'real' or not.
