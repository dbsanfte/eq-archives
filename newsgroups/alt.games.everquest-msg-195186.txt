Ok, I'm not normally much into the fashion that's on my EQ characters.
I'm much more into how their equipment works than how it looks. But I've
gotten to the point that I can't take the loincloth look that small
ornate chain leggings have on my Wood Elf ranger anymore. So, any
suggestions on what I could replace them with that a level 27 could
acquire on her own? I don't have tons of cash, either, but I'm sure
there must be something out there that would be a worthwhile upgrade
that I can get my hands on. Thanks in advance.
