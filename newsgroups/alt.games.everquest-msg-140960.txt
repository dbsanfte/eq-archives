Here's my guess.  I'm pretty sure that Kunark came out well before the
foraging change that made it so that people dying of hunger and/or thirst
would forage up food and/or water instead of random junk.  I seem to recall
that in those days, it was pretty hard to forage water...it was just one
item in the forage table for the zone, and so could take a while to hit it.

So, perhaps the idea was that you'd carry around a water extractor and a
tablet, and when you were dying of thirst, you'd make some water.

Of course, the tablets being lore make this a dumb idea (well...a dumber
idea, since the whole notion is pretty dumb when compared to just chucking
the extractor and getting an 8 slot container and taking a few extra stacks
of water with you).
