Cleric or Chanter would have the most likelihood of getting a group
out of that list. (my opinion) As for between those two? There seem to
be more low level clerics than chanters, and also Druid and Shaman can
take over the healer role, but chanters are really the best for crowd
control and they have crack.

Chanter is the one you would probably get into a group with easiest.
At least in my opinion on my server (FV) at low levels. However if the
group already has a cleric or chanter, a second cleric would be added
long before a second chanter would.
