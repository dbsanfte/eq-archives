Thank you for the input -  I may very well have to do as you suggest, but
I'd do it as a last resort. I had set my mind on attaining 70 AA's before
going to 61, but sadly I was tempted to ding after I'd gained my 45th AA.
Since then experience is very hard to come by. Lord knows why I actually
decided to move to 61, as IMHO the Wizard spells aren't much of an upgrade
until I hit level 63 - and by then I most certainly *will* need to be in the
PoP zones.

Kind regards ..

Stevie.
