[George C. Scott]

"Mr. President we cannot allow, a mass-murder gap!"

[/George C. Scott]

This is so shocking. This is so frightening, terrifying even. But that's
the point. Whoever did this is going to get clobbered, hard. For what
it's worth though, I'd ask that you Americans are completely sure who it
is you take your revenge on. More innocent people do not deserve to die
merely because they happen to share the same creed, colour or
nationality of whoever committed this atrocity. The hatred and venom
being spat just in this thread is enough to make you shiver.

I couldn't help but feel for the people who were involved. I'd be lying
if I said I never spared a thought for the American friends I've made
playing this silly game, worrying whether they were all right.

Though I feel the need to wag another finger, I don't think that would
be wise, not in this atmosphere. 

Take care.
