Actually, the dragon is a collector's edition item.  Not a pre-order item. 
But as you pointed out, it's an indoor pet only.  No advantage to the 
player.

The J-Boots are the only pre-order item in EQ2.

My guess on the jboots is that they will probably be similar in speed to the 
rogue's pathfinding ability.  Ie, helpful but not substantially so, and of 
no impact in combat.  Therefore, giving no pre-order player any advantage 
over any other player.
