Selo's worked, it just didn't take the drum bonus into account.  I was 
40ish at the time, and ran as SoW speed.  Damn annoying, but not 
umplayable.

A much, much better way is this:
/stopsong
/pause 4
/cast 3

That gives you 4/10s of a second for it to recover, which in my experience 
is enough in all but the most lagged out situations.  Playing with a 
decently fast computer /pause 3 works, I play to try /pause 2 as soon as 
my new motherboard comes in.
