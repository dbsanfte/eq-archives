Correct.   You cannot attack or move while casting, or the spell will be
interrupted.  (and the game auto delays your attacks)

Sort of, see below.

No.  Actually a long delay weapon will hurt you.  See below.

No.


It works out like this.

If you're a priest or robed caster class, your melee will be aborted while
you try to cast.    Casting a 4 second spell midway through your 3 second
swing time will result in a 7 second break before your next melee attack..
(4 second cast time, then your 3 second swing time counts down from full
again.  The 1.5 seconds you waited earlier is lost.)

If you're a hybrid class, Paladin, SK, Ranger, your melee will be paused
whle you cast.    You still can't strike during the casting time, but you
don't lose the time you've already waited.   Assuming  the same facts... 4
second cast time, 3 second swing, beginning casting after waiting 1.5
seconds.    You would stop meleeing as you began to cast, but you would
attack 5.5 seconds after.   (4 second cast time, plus the 1.5 seconds left
on the timer.)
