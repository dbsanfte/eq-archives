One piece of advice - go find an enchanter when you go gem shopping and
get a charisma buff. Invest in some cheap charisma gear too. For
example, I needed to buy a ruby for someone to make me a silver ruby
veil. This cost 130pp, however this was a saving of about 30-40pp off
the price I would have got had a kindly level 44 enchanter not upped my
charisma by about 30 points. It makes a difference...

Also, this is one time you want to have good faction with the merchants.
Noone cares if they have to spend 7sp instead of 6sp for a sewing
pattern or something, but if the price is hiked 10% on something costing
hundreds of pp, that's lots of beer money... so look for gem merchants
in your home town or whatever.
