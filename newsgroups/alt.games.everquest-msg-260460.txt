I keep seeing this tossed about.

I still find slow capability *indispensable* in GoD.  Without slow, any
sub-par tank (i.e., any paladin/SK or under-10k warrior) is likely to suffer
death after death.  Yeah, the mobs die fast, but they also hit fast.

Every GoD group I've seen formed includes a slower.  Granted, especially in
Tipt/Vxed and Ikkinz 2, that is most often an enchanter, but that's due to
their other abilities and doesn't impugn slowing in general.
