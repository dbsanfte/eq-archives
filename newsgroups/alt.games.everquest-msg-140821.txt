The way I understand it the guild leader can assign who has access to
the tree of life. The tree of life radiates healing energy to all the
city buildings around it based on contracts with the guild. It also
allows guard set up.  The number of guards and the weapons they carry
however is based on how many guard posts and weaponsmiths are set up.
