There is a easy fix for that and most ANY experienced player will tell
you the same!

Remap your "A"ttack key to a very used letter!! I have mine mapped to
the letter "Z"
After dying NUMEROUS times cause I accidently the the "A" key when I
first started game I learned that lesson the hard way.

Though I had to do  a little more remapping not too  long after that
that....
I had the "X" as my inventory key, but after hitting the "Z" key right
next to it a few times by accident, I moved inventory to "B" key.

One other thing I do now is...
Unless I am specifically talking to a NPC , I NEVER have them
targetted while I am within striking distance of them ;-)
