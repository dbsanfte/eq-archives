Seen the message 3 times today, i normally leave my character on whilst im
working (i work from home sometimes) hitting the forage hotbutton everynow
and again, keeping up with guild chat etc.............from what i can from
my log files i last about 2 hours before i get the message, this has only
started happening since the patch.
