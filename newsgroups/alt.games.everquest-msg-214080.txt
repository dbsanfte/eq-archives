Agreed. A loot system of some sort does make a lot of sense.

Otherwise some guy shows up once, gets some super drop he wants at the 
perceived expense of the guys who've been 'camping' it for months and 
never shows up again, and everybody gets a bad taste in their mouth...

I don't have a problem with people getting some 'credit' for being there 
  on days when they didn't get anything.

But it should be equitable. Someone who is there 80% of the time should 
rate above someone whos there 20% of the time, but that 20 percenter 
should get at least 1/4 of what the 80 percenter does, all else being equal.

But attend 50% of the raids... get zero eligibility for anything ...this 
is just as wrong as the first scenario.

Yup.
