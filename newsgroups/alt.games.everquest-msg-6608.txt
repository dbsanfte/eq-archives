Terrible... the sound in the game isnt that great anyway, so I always have a
CD playing or something else going on while playing, but the performance for
my system config on Win2K is not that great:

Athlon 1100
256Mhz PC-150
GeForce Ultra 64MB DDR
SBLive 5.1 Platinum
960Kbit ADSL connection

and still the game is somewhat chunky at times.  Better than my other system
which is a PIII500 with VooDooo 3500 but not by much.  The game is just on
old technology and really was developed before Win2K.  I would probably
blame DirectX on Win2K before I blame Verant except that games like
Counterstrike and resource pigs like Black and White run fabulously.
