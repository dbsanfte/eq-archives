Painful camp, but honestly the only real intel/mana choice a caster
has.  Are there any +charisma items you can use in this slot instead?

>back: kunzar cloak (2) - buy
>chest: crystalline robe (6) - camp (crystal caverns/queen dracnia) or buy

I'd personally go with Ishiva.  About the same price (on Fennin,
anyway). and provides more mana.  The Ishiva could see your enchanter
well into his raid years.

>ears: batskull x2 (10) - camp (timorous deep/the great oowomp)

I'd go with Black Sapphire earrings... Switching over to 4intel/2 str
later on.

>face: sheer bone mask (3) - camp (timorous deep/the great oowomp)

Not much of a choice here.

>feet: polished stone anklet (2) - camp (field of bone/burynai cutter)

Keep in mind, that even at level 50, the most these things will ever
give you is 20 mana.  Consider that Wolf Fur Slippers provide that
much *right now*, and not nearly as bad a camp.  By the time you want
to get rid of these, you'll be looking for GEBS anyway.

>fingers: velium fire wedding rings x2 (0) - buy

Interesting choice.  However, the 6 AC will never do you any good, and
the 65 hit points are wasted in most good groups anyway.  

>hands: impskin gloves (5) - buy or camp (sol a/kindle)

For 100 plat, you can have yourself some dusty bloodstained gloves.
+25 mana, something those impskins simply won't be able to give you
until your 30s or so.

>head: runed circlet (4) - buy, or nightshade wreath (5) - camp (mistmoore/maid
>issis) or buy

Unless you can affoard a runed cowl, the Nightsade is really your best
bet for quite a while.

>legs: drake hide legs - buy

Again, not terribly many choices as far as caster legs go, so it's a
good spot for Charisma.  Good choice.

>neck: sapphire platinum (7) or velium (8) necklace - buy

Pick up a Black Sapphire necklace, too.  Or a petrified erudite heart.

>shoulder: embroidered black cape (0) - buy

By far your best choice until you can start on the Thurg shawl quests.

>waist: braided cinch cord (4) - buy

4 intel is about the most you can get for this slot.  Offhand, I'd go
for str or charisma here.

>wrists: golden cat eye bracelet x2 (0)

Good choice, seeing as how your best choices include polished bone
bracers or woven grass braclets.  You won't loose much by going for
charisma here.

>primary: stein of moggok (10) - buy

Ugh? No weapon at all?  Either you plan on being grouped most all the
time(which is about right), or you're going to have to rely on your
pet and spells to kill everything.  If you're going for the latter,
I'd suggest getting hold of more mana items, expecially for the early
days of your chanter's career.  

Keep in mind that at level one, you're only ever getting one mana
perpoint of intel.  It scale up roughly to one additional mana per
intel per five levels... at 50, the most you'll ever get is 10 intel
per mana.

This makes for some interesting choices.  For instance, until
somewhere in your late teens, the simple Skull of J'enthra will
provide more raw mana than a glowing stien.  Until level 30 or so,
Moonstone rings are the best deals going.  And an oracle robe will
provide more mana than an SMR until somewhere in the mid 30's.

So remember, intel isn't everything.  Until you hit your 30's, it's
simply a good idea not to be worried about it too much.  And even at
that, it's remarkably easy to hit your 200 intel cap, at which point
you'll start switching backsome of that +mana gear into your suit.
And this isn't even dealing with hit points, magic resist, and
strength.
