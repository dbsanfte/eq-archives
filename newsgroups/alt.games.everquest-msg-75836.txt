I have a similar problem. I log in, sound works, tralalala. I enter the
world, sound works. I count to 8 and the sounds locks up, like a cd with a
really bad scratch. Moving around before or after, zoning into kunark or
Gfay, it doesn't matter. 8 seconds all the time and then,
dudududududududududududududu. Funny that.
And it's not just EQ sound that goes wonky. I usualy have winamp playing in
the background, never had any trouble with that, I could even control winamp
with my multimedia keyboard keys. However 8 seconds after entering the
world, you guessed it, dudududududududududududu

Any thoughts?
