Holy cow!  This is some really cool stuff.  I'm just really worried about
what this is going to do to classes like the Necro and Magician.  All of
the sudden Necros make a nice group buffer?  I think it's really cool
that they can make small buffs in a few areas in a "siphoning" manner,
but it kind of seems against the classes nature.  And now, level 60
magicians are going to be REAL important for high level raids.  The
ability to stop the people in an area from being summoned?  THat's
freakin awesome.  You know all the people at VI testing this are taking
these spells and going on raids of things like Sleeper's and Tunare to
see if this "ruins" the concept they had for the end game encounters.
But I really like it.  Luclin's look good.  Let's just hope it comes out
on time :)
