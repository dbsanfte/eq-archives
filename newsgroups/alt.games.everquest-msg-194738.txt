I have been trying for a week now to work on my epic (Shaman) but
can't get past the Test Of Patience in Erud's Crossing.   When I go
there to do the turn-in of the gem, there are four (4) Ooglyn's
wandering around the island!  When I do the turn-in, she just poofs.
I tried going to the location where the other NPC's are supposed to
spawn at the bottom of the ocean and sat there for over 2 hours with
no results.  Not to mention the fact that there are sharks flying
around in the air, one group of about a dozen sharks all stacked on
top of each other, the two boats running over each other, etc...
Obviously something is haywire with this zone.  I've tried to do the
quest and had to restart it 3 times in the last week.  I have
petitioned twice and filled out the form on the EQLive website but no
results yet.  Hoping something straightens out soon.  Anyone else have
this problem ever?

Solusek Ro Server BTW.
