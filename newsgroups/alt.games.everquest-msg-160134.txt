I thought of that, but the processor is *extremely* hot to touch.  Hot
enough where you don't want to try again, hehe.

All fans are moving and in correct rotation.  Processor fan is the stock fan
that came with the processor, is rather large, and is the fan recommended by
AMD.

It's set by default to exactly what AMD's site recommends.

I am concerned.  That's why I'm posting this anywhere I think I can get
answers.  All my other systems don't run over 110 degrees farenheit (sorry,
I don't know my metrics).

Thanks for your input though.  I appreciate any angle I can get right now.
I have my bios set to automatically shut the system down if it hits 70C.  So
far it hasn't reached that level since ripping the case off and putting
fanzilla on it.
