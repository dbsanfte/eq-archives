My guild has a volunteer who maintains the roster, keeping track of
mains and active alts of planar level. No one is required to share
their e-mail address, but as guild leader, I do in a stickied thread
on our internal board. Several guild members also have my phone number
and we are considering instituting a call list so that people can
volunteer to be called for specific events that are based on random or
semi-random spawns.

We do have a bank for cash and resist gems gotten on multiparty raids
and use the funds in that bank to buy reagents (peridots, coffins,
port stones, etc.) for use during raids so that we don't bankrupt our
clerics, necromancers, and wizards. It has also recently expanded to
include droppable items no one on the raid where it drops wants,
hand-me-downs, Velious quest gems, and Velious quest MQ items.These
items are listed on the forum with each audit and available to any
main in the guild that can use them

We've also used guild funds to train a jewelcrafter to 250 and guild
diamonds and blue diamonds to make resist gear. Guild members pay 300
plat per piece to buy velium resist gear and 100 plat for all other
resist gear (mostly to cover the cost of metals and to provide for bad
combines.) Bank funds are used so that members who can't afford to buy
resist gear can owe the jewelcrafter money without bankrupting him.
This allows us to field a full crew in the Halls of Testing without
burning through guild funds faster than we can replace them.

The guild bank is funded by cash and non-diamond gem drops on guild
raids. Eventually, we will probably also fund it from the sale of raid
drops and MQs that no one in the guild wants.

We do this because raids can be *expensive*. Our first Plane of Sky
raid took around 11k to complete over 3 days. Getting resist gear has
cost about 5k already. We'd never be able to do these things if we
tried to make individual players eat the cost.

We have a message board, but no web site. No one in the guild has
stepped forward to put one up and it would be a *lot* of work. We also
have a non-official mailing list that existed long before the guild
was formed.

The guild is not a democracy. I run it, giving up as little control as
possible. Most guilds fold and most paths guilds can follow lead to
failure or stagnation and most of my friends are too good natured to
make the hard choices that keep a guild healthy long-term.

We respect the server's reservation and rotation policy and the
generally accepted rules of camp claim and FCFS, rather than strict
adherance to the play nice policy, which is completely ignored on
Torvonillous except by a few pricks who want to steal people's camps
or generally make a nuisance of themselves.

Our guild has a recommended minimum age of 18, unenforcable, but a
guideline that keeps us from taking in people who are clearly immature
and keeps members from complaining that our guildchat is unsuitable
for children. We don't ban *any* language, but reserve the right to
mock people who sound too silly.

We put together a guild to organize activities that we were interested
in as a group. Once we had momentum, we established a level minimum of
52. Now that most of the guild is of a level to play in areas like the
Temple of Veeshan and the like, we're about to impose class-based
level limits ranging from 55 to 58. You have to build a guild like you
build an XP group: Make sure you have enough raid-essential classes
and levels to support everyone else there. At some point, we will more
or less stop recruiting all together so that we can focus on members
already in the guild.

Applicants are required to attend at least one raid, then get at least
five sponsors (or more, depending on how many trial members we have at
the time,) attend two more raids, and receive a YES vote from more
than half the guild without getting two NO votes or four APPREHENSIVE
votes.

We do have "evil cliques" in our guild and heartily encourage them. Of
course, we call them "regular experience groups" and recognize that
they're based on the way the people involved want to play. I don't
have one because I'm usually using XP groups to get to know newer
guildmembers.
