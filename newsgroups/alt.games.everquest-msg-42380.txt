Just out of curiosity, why? Why did you try to level up "as fast as
possible"?

Damn, since when was a 21/31 magic 2hs with the damage bonus of a 40+
delay 2hs "poor equipment" for a lvl 40? Regardless of the fact that the
price has dropped like crazy on the price of the ol' Mith2hander, it is
still a very nice weapon. Are there better ones out there? Sure, but not
everyone has 5-10kpp to get one, either. 

Still, I would spend some time getting a good shield and 1 hander before
worrying about upgrading your 2hs.

You could spend some time questing for your Ro armor. Have you quested
for the pally weapons? Ghoulbane, Soulfire?

at 40, I would head to Lower Guk, SolB, City of Mist, or Kaesora. Good
experience, fun places, and awesome loot.
