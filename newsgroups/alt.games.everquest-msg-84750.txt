VI, being a gaming company, does not provide technical help with your
network.  Despite that disclaimer, the following information has been
sent in hopes that is of some help.

If your firewall requires you to hard code the IP of the patch server(s)
note that the actual IP changes with some frequency.  If you have such a
firewall you will want to check for an IP change if you are unable to
connect.  You can do this by doing a DNS lookup on the
patch.everquest.com address.

If your firewall requires you to specify open UDP ports you should open
all ports above 1024, as well as 1024 itself.

If your firewall requires you to configure accessible IP blocks you can
use the information above, though depending on your specific firewall
you may not be able to use the summerizations listed at the bottom.

This just restates what was said above regarding UDP ports, 1024 and
above must all be opened to the listed IP ranges, as well as on the
client.

Again, by "not support" they mean that it is your job to maintain your
own network.  They will not come to your house to set it up, nor will
they talk you through it over the phone.  In no way are they implying
that you should not or can not play over such a connection.  They merely
are saying that its up to you to make your own network function as they
have a game to worry about.  Well the part about the game I stuck on,
its not actually stated by them in their message.
