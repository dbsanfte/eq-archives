This sounds like you actually have *4* accounts... 2 EQ only accounts,
and 2 Station Passes.

Well, first thing to do is try to figure out which EQ account(s) you
are actually using.  I don't play EQ anymore but if it's anything like
WoW, there's some way to go from the game launcher to account
management.

If you are really lucky, the accounts that you play are just the 2
EQ-only ones, and you can just drop the station passes.  

Way back when WoW came out, I had an account for playing EQ and EQ2.
It was probably a Station Pass or the equivalent.  Anyway, at one
point I decided to stop playing EQ and change the account type from
Station Pass to EQ2 only.  At that time, the only way to do it was to
cancel my Station Pass, let it expire, then reactivate it as a single
game account.  

I'm suspecting they've changed it and you can now change account
types, because that made it way too easy to drop EQ2 completely when I
got hooked on WoW.

Good luck straightening out your accounts.
