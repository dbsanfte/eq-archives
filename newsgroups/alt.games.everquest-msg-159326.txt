Im doing the beguile plant spell quest and while i realise its probably 
not worth the effort and the spells not that useful its been fun as i 
havent done many quests before.
Part of the quest involved getting a silk for a Strathbone healer spider 
in Kaesora. Ive read a bit about these and apparently there very 
difficult even for a 39 druid(the mob is level 30) because of there 
ability to heal themselves.
I cant use my stun spell fury of the air because its outdoors only
I was wondering if any druid had found a way to solo these and what they 
did to interrupt its healing casting.
I was thinking of trying a bit of melee on them but as a druid i cant 
reliably hurt them with melee and ive yet to see my melee stun anything, 
even a fire beetle!
Any tips on this would be cool
I think i might have to group for this one which is fine but i like the 
idea of using strategy to solve this is possible.
