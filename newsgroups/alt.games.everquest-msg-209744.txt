This illustrates why splits are almost always bad.  Using Lance's numbers,
if you had went 100% AA for one AA point and then 100% regular to level 52, 
you end up at 52 with one AA point in exactly the same amount of time, but
instead of not getting the AA point until the end, you get the AA point in
half the time.  If the AA point is something that will help you get XP, you
might even get level 52 earlier than with the split.

It's probably possible to come up with situations where a split is a good
idea, but most of the time it isn't.

That's the problem I am facing.  I'm level 58.  I've got a nice spot that
has blues (some started going light blue at 58, but most are still blue),
the spawn times are fast enough that I am limited by mana regen, there's
almost never contention, and there are no hostile wanderers, so I can go AFK
to med.  If I finish 58 here, I think enough will go light blue that it will
be time to move on.  On the other hand, if I switch to AA while staying 58,
I can get an AA point in about 10 hours of play.  That is perfect for my
schedule, in which I've got a couple hours a day in the evening--I can pick
up an AA point in a week during my "Star Trek" watching time.

So...push on to 59, and try to find a place I can grind out to 60, where
Wizards get a significant boost in power, or stop at this known good spot at
58, and grind out AA for a couple months?
