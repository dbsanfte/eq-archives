Hate to break it to you, but if this was a true restart made out to be 
just like the beginning of Everquest, there were NO SK Gnomes. 

The only reason Sony/Verant implimented this stupid server was so they 
could rake in their monthly fees by starting the game all over again.  
Meanwhile they have ruined all the normal servers that have been online 
for the past 7 years.  Making all the monsters huge undercon's.

Finally picked a gnome SK, which is what I've been toying around with
most recently, although I was second guessing myself right up to the
moment of truth.
  <br>
  <br>
As suggested in the forums, beastlords and berserkers are not
available, nor are Iksar or Vah Shir.&nbsp; Something I hadn't seen
mentioned one way or another, Frogloks are also out.&nbsp; BUT my pick,
gnome SK, was in, despite the fact that this combo wasn't legal at
initial release.
  <br>
  <br>
Took a long time to log in.&nbsp; And every time I zoned, that took a long
time too, even an -in zone- zoning when dying in the same place where
I'm bound.&nbsp; Lag due to crowding, I guess.
  <br>
  <br>
Because crowded it was.&nbsp; 120 people in Akanon.&nbsp; 180 in Steamfont.&nbsp; When
I got over there, 476 in GFay.&nbsp; These numbers dropped significantly
over time, and by today, were at no more than 2/3rds those stats. Still
a LOT of people.
  <br>
  <br>
I handed in my note, got my tin shirt, and ran off in search of some
adventure.&nbsp; No newbie armor quests, as expected.&nbsp; Out to Steamfont,
where the field was littered with bodies, dead gnomes and dead mobs.
I'm not ashamed to check dead bodies for loot... no trade newbie quest
armor was all that was left, the gnomes were gleaning everything that
could be sold even for a copper.&nbsp; I wandered around for a while,
literally never saw a mob that wasn't engaged, few that weren't
actually dead.
  <br>
  <br>
After a while of this, I went back inside and went after the decaying
rat type mobs, they were also behing hunted, but not as efficiently, I
dinged to two on these, and things got even more frustrating, as the
distance each would move my bar got much smaller, and yet the pace had
picked up and I was seeing ever fewer of the things not already
engaged. &nbsp;I tried handing in their drops to the exterminator, but got
bad faction with the SK guild, not a good plan I guess.&nbsp; It also didn't
pay well at all, nor give much in the way of exp even at level 2.&nbsp;
Waste of time quest unless maybe you're really more concerned with
building faction with one of the factions that likes this behaviour.
  <br>
  <br>
Well, I went back down to the SK guildmaster to train a bit at this
point, and found out the best way to level; the mines of malfunction,
which are part of Akanon's single zone, are hard to reach, and many of
the "good" gnomes don't even seem to know of its existance.&nbsp; It still
had dozens of people in there fighting, but it was quite possible to
run around and keep finding mobs to kill, blue white or even yellow to
me. Skellies dropped bone chips, rusty weapons, and small cloth, too,
eventually I managed a full outfit and a rusty shortsword, and a pocket
full of chips.
  <br>
  <br>
And to level, to three and then to four.&nbsp; At one point I ran out to the
windmills and purchased some sharpening stones, sharpening a rusty
shortsword I'd found to Tarnished, significantly better than the *short
sword I'd been issued.
  <br>
  <br>
At four I went out and traveled over to GFay, did the mail run a couple
times, got in a group that tried but failed to handle orcs or zone into
crushbone to do orcs there.&nbsp; Finding targets that we could kill was too
frustrating, eventually we broke up before any of us had leveled.
Wandering the zone solo, though, I was able to find a fair few,
eventually leveling up to 5.&nbsp; I couldnt' bank or sell in Kelethin, I
could bank but not sell in Felwithe... so I tossed my ill gotten loot
plus four CB Belts into the shared slots, then logged and made a
throwaway character who sold the loot and turned in the belts, getting
me a few pieces of Tattered armor to replace some of the cloth; he
dinged to three on that alone.
  <br>
  <br>
Then I went back to Steamfont, where the crowding had dropped
precipitously down to 108... well ok, that wasn't such a big drop, but
after 476 it suddenly didnt seem so bad.&nbsp; I got in a group at the
windmill and got to play a real tank for the first time, pulling mobs
willy nilly, keeping the tempo up as high as I could, which admittedly
was limited more by the fact that others were sharing the area than by
party mana/hp flow.&nbsp; Keeping aggro was a difficulty, given that I only
had one spell, Disease Cloud, that could be cast on them, and despite
having maxed my taunt.&nbsp; The level one SK spell, Spike of Disease, is
available only in the tutorial, sorely missed.&nbsp; I ding up to 8 in this
group, and get a minotaur battle axe (8/37) to boot... but practically
no other loot.&nbsp; FFA and I just tend not to loot, plus I'm busy pulling
the next as soon as one mob drops.&nbsp; But wanting armor and weapons and
spells and a little tradeskilling, thats not a good plan.
  <br>
  <br>
Something else during that run, I got my level 7, which meant pet.&nbsp;
He's significantly less effective in this situation,&nbsp; lacking summoned
gear and external buffs, he's little better than a free DOT and
occaisional distraction... and he chews thru bone chips, dying and
needing replacement.&nbsp; If I wasn't puller as well as MT he'd be a bit
less trouble.&nbsp; Anyway, I crawl off to bed along about here.
  <br>
  <br>
Next morning, I solo a bit, most of it on low blues and greens, just to
get some capital together for my next big push; fletching.&nbsp; A fletching
kit runs more than a plat, a princely sum at my level.&nbsp; Then I buy
several stacks of the most basic arrow components, and set about making
myself several hundred arrows (they stack in hundreds these days,
rather than 20s like I remember) till the combine becomes trivial at
16, and a far more expensive (runs almost a gold) staff and twine,
which I succeed with first try, making a Rough Hickory Recurve bow with
a hemp thread, 10/50 range 50.&nbsp; Now I can pull without spending mana on
it, although casting pulls are better when keeping aggro is a priority.
  <br>
  <br>
Next group is over near the mino caves, where I get up to 9th level
again serving as mad puller, with several deaths due to people not
being very good at playing their classes... and the classic Mino Hero
stompdown.&nbsp; Not that death makes us blink at all, at this level, the
only trouble is having to run back from bind, delaying the action (or
in our case, slowing it down, since we didn't stop pulling, noone was
crucial to the action)
  <br>
  <br>
Later, that evening, I noticed someone in the AGE channel (I only
remember to log onto it about half the time when I log in, really need
to get the syntax figured out for autojoin) who turns out to be Goom;
Vaxus, playing a necro out in the Freeport area.&nbsp; Well, I spend a while
getting spells and helping locate a corpse lost in GFay and so on, but
gradually make my way over to BB and then translocator to Freeport,
where I get distracted by the fact that I don't know the town at all,
now (its new Freeport), and again help someone locate a body... he
wasn't even in the right zone by the way, apparantly some of the people
playing are really newbies, or close to it!
  <br>
  <br>
Anyway, get a bind (without spending an hour asking for one, by the
way, soulbinders really really rock in a world where only a few dozen
people are over 12th level, and none likely to spend time sitting and
casting for others) find my way out to EC, and give Vaxus a tell.&nbsp; He
invites me to come over to his group doing orc 2, and I come do that
for a while. Again I'm nominal MT, and again have difficulty holding
aggro even though I now have several spells (disease cloud, siphon
strength, lifetap) at my command (missing TWO now, not only Spike of
Disease, but also Despair, which is available only in tutorials or in
Echo Caverns; Luclin is about 9 months away), luckily again this isn't
really important.&nbsp; We work this spot for a while, pulling the camp and
anything else that wanders by... that isn't being killed by someone
else. Luckily things aren't as camped out as they have been before, and
this about doubles our pull, which is still a bit on the slow side.
  <br>
  <br>
A wandering ogre shaman hits us all with SOW (for tips which apparantly
range from 3 to 5 gp, by the way a FORTUNE at this level, particularly
since again I haven't been looting.) and we convince the group to run
off and try our luck in NRo.
  <br>
  <br>
NRo is more fun than the orc camp, for one thing its the new version,
which means although its familiar, its still a learning experience.&nbsp;
For another, the mobs are higher level and present a real challenge.&nbsp;
And then, for added fun, there are the Sand Giants.&nbsp; Dominating the
landscape, these aren't the SG's of my Oasis days, a few loose cannons
roaming occaisionally and garnering /ooc crys of warning and despair.
No, they are omnipresent and easily visible.&nbsp; Luckily they have a
relatively short aggro range, so its possible to pull around and among
them... but we don't know their wander paths, and haven't really
developed the old "these things will kill anything that gets near them"
reflexes, so we get wiped a few times, and I personally die quite a lot
from them... the lag from 160 people in the zone doesn't help either.
  <br>
  <br>
Working with Vaxus is fun, because we can compare notes; the spells I'm
getting as an SK are generally pale imitations of the ones he gets as a
necro, I'm looking forward to ones he's had for several levels already.
&nbsp;For the most part, my spells are tools that support my melee role,
sort of like having a swiss army knife.. while his versions of the same
thing are massively superior as befits someone who's reliant almost
entirely on those spells to get his job done, he's got the Dewalt power
tool set compared to mine.
  <br>
  <br>
I ding 11, which means snare at last (still no fear till next level),
spend a lot of time running back to camp from my bind in Freeport, get
a couple Derv Cutthroat Rings (Uber!) Next level, Fear.&nbsp; Snare helps
out in the group, allowing me to bring double pulls in seperately so
one can be peeled, or to help casters run kite circles instead of
hoping the hapless tanks can pull the mobs off of them (taunt SO
doesn't work yet), but my snaring role is somewhat limited due to the
presence of a couple necromancers in the group, who've had it for
several levels already. From my earlier time in EQ, I know it won't
likely be an important part of my grouping repetoir due to the fact
that so many other classes get their own snare, most better than the SK
one.&nbsp; Still, its a good tool to have, now I feel like I'm nearing being
an actual SK... I still need Fear and FD, and it would help if I had
more aggro producing tools as well.
  <br>
  <br>
One other note, running across BB I noticed that the LDoN camp is
there, but none of the mobs are, except for the soulbinder.&nbsp; Very nice
having a soulbinder right there in the thick of the action, instead of
tucked away in a city, and also not near any guards who might aggro due
to race/class/religion, or even hunting practices.&nbsp; Sadly, the LDoN
camp in NRo is completely deserted; not only no regular residents, but
no soulbinder either.&nbsp; Closest points would be EFP or EC Tunnel.&nbsp; Out
of laziness, I keep my EFP bind, although EC would be a little closer.&nbsp;
It turns out bind point isn't as important to me as a melee as it would
be for my usual healer or caster types, since lacking Gate, the only
time I'm at bind is when I'm naked; I can't buy anything or do much of
anything useful... at my level, it takes me forever even to kill a
decaying skeleton in the newbie part of NRo (we're low on bone chips
and I figure its worth the delay).&nbsp; Bind near a bank would change that,
I could leave cash there and use it to buy supplies as needed... but I
can't think of many soulbinders convenient to banks.
  <br>
  <br>
Logged out for the night, still 11 in a world which already has some
