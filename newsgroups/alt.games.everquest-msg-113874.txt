I'll have to fully concur with another poster. Unbroken Fear is quite the 
worst place I can think of for CR... And, unfortunately, now I speak from 
experience.

(actually, I was one of the very few people in the raid who got a rez, 
and that was *just* before the timer expired, so I have no right to 
complain, but still an ass-naked Fear break-in is an experience I'd 
hesitate to recommend)
