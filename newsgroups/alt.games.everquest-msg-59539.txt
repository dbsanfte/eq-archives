I have heard dex helps JC, so I got mine to about 190ish and I made...
Velium Sapphire Necklace (no fails)
2 Velium Jasper Rings (no fails)
and a load of platinum stuff, including diamond, jacinth, and black
sapphire, all success...
but then a couple days ago I failed almost every attempt, and 11 attempts at
a platinum black pearl rings yielded 3... ow...
I dont know if the dex thing is true or not, but I keep it on just in case.
Oh, btw my JC skill at that time was 200
