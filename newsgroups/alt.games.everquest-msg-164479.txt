If they are, there is a bit of european hypocrisy when it comes to
pointing the "imperialist" fingered.

Been then you could just look at it as sour grapes from a bunch of
"has beens" who can't compete against the US economic/cultural

I'm sure if the day comes and we become "second rate" like Britain, we
will play the finger pointing game too.  :-P
