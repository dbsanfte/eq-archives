Hey gamers! It's that holiday time of year again and MVP Software has a special for you
that you will not want to miss! We had so much success with our winter holiday specials
last year that we have decided to run with it again this year! That's right, until
December 24th, we are giving away three titles of our software for every one that you
purchase! In addition, you can download demos of all our titles to try them out and see
what you like best. So come visit MVP Software today at: http://www.mvpsoft.com



Game authors! MVP is interested in your creations!

Call Dave Snyder, CEO of MVP, at

616-831-7981 between 9am and 9PM EST

P.S. I'm a big time gamer and MVP software has been providing quality software for 15
years but we have decided to branch out with our business interests on the Internet.



Are you like me, do you have a craving for some of the more "risque" titles that seem to
be available on file sharing programs but you just don't have time to download them? Did
you know that many of the small titles you downloaded are just short scenes from full
movies? Well, here comes MVP to the rescue! We have full movies and MPG CD's of "hot
clips" that are too hot to traffic in above ground! Farm animals, "lolitas", even snuff
action!



Because we're a gaming operation we can discreetly bill your credit card for software
purchases and ship in our normal mailing package. No one will know what you dirty boys
are really up too!



If you're interested in our new service contact my brother Chris directly at:
csnyder@mvpsoft.com



Happy Thanksgiving and thanks for keeping MVP Software going strong as we ride on into
our 16th year of serving you!
