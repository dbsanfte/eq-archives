 I wouldn't worry about it.  My standard is three, and I can keep four up if
I turn spell graphics off.  However, with four...one missed note or if my
finger isn't quite quick enough one will drop for a second before I get it
up again.  People who say they twist 5 are smoking something, and they're
not sharing (IE, they're lying, not keeping 5 up at the same time, or using
an instrument/item for one or more of the songs).
