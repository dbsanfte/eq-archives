Cute.  I managed to post without calling anyone a name.  Well, at least 
you put a smiley face behind it...that makes it all okay.

Can you back any of that up, or is that your political opinion?  Calling 
someone a name, whether it's idiot, ***hole, or cute-little-puppet does 
not further your argument any at all.

I can tell you haven't been anywhere near an Ivy League college.  Even 
though most selective colleges say they do not have minimum SAT 
requirements, in effect, all of them do. The cutoff may be fairly 
informal, but it is still real. If you do not score above that cutoff, 
you will not have a chance of getting in.

As for paying for it, I don't see how the Bush family's wealth has any 
bearing on his intelligence.

Maybe, but at least I'm offering something other than name-calling.

I appreciate your opinion.  Really, I do.  But even *if* everything you 
say here were true, does that make the president an idiot?  It was that 
implication (and the pro-terrorist undertones) that I responded to in 
the poster from the UK.
