Yeah I was amazed in the barb area to see so many naked who were blue
to me or even some even. Not only do we get patchwork for turning in
white Polar bear skin, but almost every cub drops a ruined. From
killing stuff I got the money to buy ruined pelts from vendors and
used those and the quest patchwork to fully outfit myself, even
eventually getting a polar bear cloak for the clover shipment to WK I
was doing with the lion delight and 3 bard mails at once (one from
halas bank, surefall, and the bard by the barbs in wk all to qeynos..
equals as much as 12 gold at once plus 3 gold for lion meat shipment
etc) Plus I have never bought a spell since I got them all from the
clover shipment also (its very rarely the polar bear cloak.. only
gotten one but often a spell) I guess many of the lil barbs don't know
that we even have a useble loom in every town now so you don't even
need to buy a sewing kit ;)

I was selling them patchwork tunics for 3 gold and now am selling
medium patchwork near qeynos for 4 gold for the tunic from the young
lions I can kill in wk. Soon I shall have sow, then whee!!!

Knowledge really is power and though I assumed most of the players on
this server would be veterans from other servers I guess this is not
totally so.
