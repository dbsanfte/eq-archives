I am saying (or "agreeing" to use your term) that the features would
work without the expansion, if Sony/Verant released the lock on them,
since the files are pushed out to everyone. Where I think we disagree
is the part where you are up in arms over the tactics they are using
to sell PoP. It is the same tactics they used for the previous
expansions in one form or another. Perhaps more blantant this time
around, but no different. If you want to play with the new toys you
have to pay. <shrug>

>Ok. Fair enough. Let's call it, "justifying their actions which you

>ass kissing. Better?

I am not justifying their actions. I am merely pointing out that it is
not new, and that we have a track record of the previous three
expansions to prove that fact. Raising hell the 4th time they pull the
same stunt seems a bit pointless to me. PoP has only been out for a
few days now. If sales meet or excede Sony's expectations, the odds
are certain "features" found only in PoP will be made avaiable to
everyone. Sucks, but that's business.

I personally feel that the original intent was to open the new raid
system to everyone. The last minute change may have been based on PoP
pre-orders. The fact still remains that Sony/Verant has a track record
of tieing features to expansions, and the new Raid system was never
promised to everyone.

I think the example applies. On my old server (Innoruuk(sp)) East
Commons was THE trade zone. On any given night 120+ people could be
found there selling/buying. Within days (not counting the first few
days of patch mayhem) of the release of Luclin, EC was completely
empty. If you wanted to buy gear on the player market, you bought
Luclin. If that isn't extortion to buy an expansion, I don't know what
is.

I think the "No Drop" on the new spells is a direct response to the
players that scalp (and basically rape) other players who don't have
access to the spells when a new expansion launches. Anyone remember
how much Breeze went for shortly after Kunark launched? Or how much
the Druid ports to Velious went for? Sony/Verant could have put the
new spells on the old world vendors, but that doesn't fit the
established pattern of expansions. Again, if you want to play with the
new toys, you have to pay.

I am not justifying or appologizing for Sony/Verant. If I had my way
things would be a lot different, but then I don't run the company, and
I don't have to show a profit to the stockholders.
