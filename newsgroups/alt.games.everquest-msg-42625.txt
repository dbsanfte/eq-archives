Well, thanks for the help everybody!  I think we are gonna give the
Ranger/Shaman combo a go tonight, and I've got a buddy starting an enchanter
to mess with as well.  A shadowknight or necro partner sounds good, but my
main is a troll SK so I wanted to do something different.  And she won't
play either of them because of the whole evil and death thing (go figure
eh).  ;)  But this is her first character, so who knows what she'll be
playing in a few weeks.  I think my main was my 4th character.  I'd be
curious to know how many out there kept playing their first character, but
that sounds like the start of a new thread!
