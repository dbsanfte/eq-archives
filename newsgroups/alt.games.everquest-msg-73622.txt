Actually there are a large number of RPG fans who do enjoy tradeskills
more than battles, who are interested in playing farmers or merchants
and the like.  Visit Funcom's website for their proposed Midgard and
you'll find a large number of folks looking forward to picking berries!!
heh, I dunno if they'll survive AO and ever actually produce the game,
but they threw out a concept and garnered some interest.  Such a game
will never see the numbers of a simple hack and slash, but those who
play are likely to be the sort that stick with the game once
established.

Good luck on your project and if you need more RP gamers to bounce ideas
off of feel free to email.  The possibilities of gaming are a passion of
mine, so much so you could say that I'm full of it <EG>.
