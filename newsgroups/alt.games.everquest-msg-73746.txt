Communication is key when grouping....Don't assume anything about
anything.....

If you're a slow typer, make yourself some macros with some key phrases
"Please heal me" etc..

As far as your story goes...I don't fuller understand...Everyone was sitting
and medding/resting and you pulled and no one helped?

If this is the case you need to set up a "/g Incoming %T" macro so the group
knows you pulled something...

OR Was the group fighting something and something else started hitting you
so you turned on it?

In which case, asking for a heal should work? or Trying to back off(not
attacking) so the MOBs aggro changes to another person....
