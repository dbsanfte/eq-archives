Aye, I just see a lot who dont even know what the mana song is, and
just whine they need it and haste when they already have both - this
is a pet hate of me and a few friends. I dish out my best hate which
without epic is about 60 normal haste, 30% over haste cap, mana song,
and resists, and Im using the call of muse as my over haste cap which
also adds strength to dot and dd songs.. Yet, these 4 songs are un
noticed.. Funny really - a couple of people notice, but the we've
found generally the SKs (no offense SKs) seem to be the ones whinning
they need haste when they have chanter haste, shammy haste, bard
haste.. hell they are so hasted its obscene and yet they will shout
haste and the reply always comes back "but I just gave you it" ...
"oh".. we have speculated that a lot of is is the feel the need rather
than actually need. We are sure that some of the buffs and stuff they
ask for they dont need and wouldnt notice if they had no buff bar that
they had or not, all they see is an icon drop and decide it was a good
thing they must need it, the fact that most people have haste gear as
melee anyway, and so hopefully only 1 buff takes them to cap.. just
makes it a scream

As a bard Im glad some people appreciate us.. I just need to find more
of them then :)
