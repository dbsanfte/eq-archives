If you can point out specifically how this could be accomplished, and

It's been my experience that they respond to all petitions eventually,
if there are CS reps online. Even ones far stupider than that. I
petitioned the other day that I wanted a pointy hat for my wizard. I got
a response. *smile*.  Granted, it wasn't a helpful one, but it was
polite and they *did* respond.

existing published policy is. Check the home pages for more details.
