The best times per say are when you get a good group fighting together as an
effective team, but there are times when finding a group is dam near
impossible. I personally do not like having to spend lengthy time finding a
group, therefore it is nice when the game offers you other options or things
to do. Surprisingly enough I have found getting a group together or joinning
a group is when your doing something as opposed to standing at bridges or
what not shouting and pleading.
My expeirence has also shown me that the best groups I've been in is when
I'm doing something because people see you are playing the game and want you
to join, most my worse partners have been the ones standing at bridges and
whatnot because lots of those are just looking for a free ride.
