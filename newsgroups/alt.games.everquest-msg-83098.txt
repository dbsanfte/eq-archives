Actually, there would be. It is entirely possible for a player to get
to 50+ without ever seeing a GM or guide or vice versa. It all depends
on whether the name is reported by another player in that case.

Yes, it is in some cases open to GM interpretation whether the name is
in violation. However, as Biz pointed out, it has nothing to do with
liking the name. I know for a fact the Tunare head GM has changed
names he found rather amusing himself, but he has to abide by the
rules (and waste his time dealing with snot-nosed brats who choose not
to).
