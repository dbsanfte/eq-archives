lvl 25 is what i have heard, there is also some weapons that is named
Coldain ........ they proc velium shards at lvl 1 for max 12 dmg, not
that much but my staff hits for a max of 21 and add 12 to that it is
rather nice :) costs a bit more of course, i payed 180pp for my 
Coldain velium great staff, that with a charisma of wooping 63 :)
