OTOH, I, for one, am  quite ready to extend my sympathy to the victim of
this stupid and prudish attitude. FWIW, they're not going to get my money,
if this is the way they make business. I'm just one among many, of course,
but still am one of their potential customers.

And, please, some editing seems to be in order, when answering to such long
messages .
