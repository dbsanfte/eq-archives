Actually, I've had a theory about this, but can't get all the components to try
it out. If you notice, Crasktusk is a 2 slot 'tiny' only containter with a
combine. There are 2 named teeth in the karanas, one off a wolf and one off a
lion. I have the lion tooth, but lost the wolf tooth. And I long ago destroyed
my only tusk. Would like very much to get those 3 together and hit combine =)
I'm sure it's a newbish weapon by even yesterdays standards. Still would be
interesting to finally test it out, though.

Good Luck!
