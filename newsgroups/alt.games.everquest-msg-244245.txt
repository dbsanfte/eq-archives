I've had one for a couple of months.  I originally bought it for use
with my bard, for two situations... chant kiting, where I am
repeatedly singing the same 4 songs in sequence and rarely have to
stop for something else, and for when I'm grouping with friends in
circumstances where the banter is as important as the killing (if not
more so).  Chatting can be tricky when trying to keep 3 or 4 songs up,
and the Nostromo makes it easy for a bard.

The downside is that when you want to stop your macro, you may have to
wait for a complete cycle.  In the case of my bard, that might mean
waiting for 4 songs to be sung, so it might take 24 seconds or so
before I can sing something else.  The only way that I've found to
interrupt it quickly is to pull the USB cable out (and I've done that
in a hurry before now!).  

There are two repeating options, auto repeat and repeat while the key
is being held down.  With auto repeat, you turn it off by hitting the
key again.  Furthermore, sometimes it completely ignores the fact that
you've hit the key again, and you end up with the cycle starting
again.  In the heat of battle, it's easy to lose track of how many
times you've hit the key and everything can get very messy.

So, if you want it for repeating macros in combat situations, be aware
of the limitations.  If you want it so that you can execute more
commands than a hot key can handle, great - it's ideal for that.  The
one thing that I've found it to be superb for is casting practice.  I
set up hotkeys to stand, cast, pause and sit etc.  Then I set up the
N52 to trigger each hotkey in turn, with a carefully balanced delay
between each cast.  I try to make it so that I sit for just enough
time to regain the mana used by a round of casting, which is typically
9 to 12 seconds between casts.  That way I can leave the character
casting away all night in a quiet area of PoK without worrying about
running out of mana.  Now that we have /autoinv available, this can
even be used for summoning, so if you can summon bread and water you
won't run out of supplies and your conjuration will be rapidly maxed.
