regretfully I keep preaching the same thing over and over for some 62 levels
now.. be sure of the type of loot group you are in prior to loot drops. It
saves tons of arguments and ticked off players. I myself am almost always
NBG and have watch several 50kpp plus items be handed over to folks, that
just part of the game helping friends and guildies alike get better gear.
Other folks play strictly greed which means everyone rolls... and then you
take the chance on /random 0 100 ...

Just be sure you know which group loot type you are in and then wont be
disappointed in how the loot is handled..
