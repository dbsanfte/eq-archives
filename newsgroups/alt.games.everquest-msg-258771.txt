I've only done very low-level measurements of haste capping.  But a level 
1 Warrior with gobs of haste (defined as FBSS+SLTW. :) ) was found to 
achieve a haste of 25.475%.  I presume that's actually 25% and a bit of 
experimental error. :)  A level 1 shaman came in at an even 20% under the 
same conditions, and a level 5 paladin came in at 27.91%.  So it seems to 
vary by class, and to vary gradually by level, as opposed to the big 
10%-20% jumps every 10 levels some published tables seem to suggest.

Aye, for simplicity, I find it easier to just consider 'Song Haste 1)' to 
be the standard buff haste.  The only real difference is which box the 
buff shows up in. :)

Mmm, more data, please. :)  Checking Lucy just gives us 'hundred hands 
effect', whatever -that- means.

Aye, tricky buggers.  Many haste buffs include effects other than haste.  
For example, augmentation includes a small agi boost and a small AC boost.  
So you can cast some other haste buff, say, celerity, and you will get the 
haste component of celerity, and the agi/ac of augmentation.  The common 
wisdom is that you only get the haste component of whatever the hastiest 
haste buff you have is.  There have been occasional claims that the haste 
buffs stack in some way, which seems unlikely to me, but I haven't seen 
any conclusive parses to rule it out.

Ah, and here I see I wasted a big ol' paragraph saying something you 
already said.  But perhaps the specific example will help.  :)

Are there really?  I can think of some Song Haste 1) items, like monk 
epic.  Ooh, very nice...  I take it all back. :)
