Ok, in my family I am the computer person, everyone hollers for me everytime
they go LD while zoning or any other crap that goes wrong with the puter.
Unfortunately, I only have an intelligent layman's knowledge of the insides
of a computer.  So my question is: What the heck is overclocking?  I have no
idea what it is, or how someone would burn out a card doing it.  Please
excuse my ignorance but I can't afford to take any fancy computer courses to
learn all this junk.
