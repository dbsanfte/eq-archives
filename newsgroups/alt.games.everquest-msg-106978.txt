There are two parts to AC, Avoidance and Mitigation.  Your monk probably has
much better Avoidance, meaning your opponent will completely miss you more
often. Your ogre has a lot of AC gear, which goes to Mitigation, meaning he
will get hit for less damage when he does get hit.  BTW, 25 hits is probably
not a significant sample size.  You need a lot of hits from the same level
mob, it could be in your test that the Underbulks differed by a level or
two.
