I agree whole-heartedly.  We're the folks who've walked from miles
around to gather in the greathall and listen to tales of far lands
and exotic places.  Though many of us may hope to see these things
for ourselves someday, the sad truth is that few will have both the
determination and the time ("Honey, you need to take the kids to
gymnastics, I've got church circle tonight", "Honey, we're going to
your mother's for dinner tonight, Aunt Minerva's in town", "Honey,
you promised to repaint the porch trim this weekend", and etc. are
mandatory in a way that no raid could ever be).
