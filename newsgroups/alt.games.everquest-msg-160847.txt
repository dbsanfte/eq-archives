    I won't dispute nature's ability to make a bigger idiot when required,
but the run to the RC spot is actually a very safe one - never more so than
now. Stay high on the wall and, in general, nothing will come after you -
and that's without invisibility of any sort. It's also a short trip. I'm the
king of the "oops" train (I didn't even know about the wanderer-free ridge
in The Grey until very recently), and I can make it from ME zone to inside
Vex Thal naked with only one of DA/DB up. And I only need that for the Stone
Guardian part of the trip.
