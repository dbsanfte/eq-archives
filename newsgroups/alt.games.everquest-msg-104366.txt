He's a quest NPC, for the folks who have good Sarnak faction
standing.

And for those who don't, he's built not to be killed very
profitably.  Note that he's green to anyone who's of a level
to hunt in Chardok, also.

Similarly, there's a level 1 (!) quest NPC giant just inside
the Kael zone near EW, but he hits like he's level 40 or more.
