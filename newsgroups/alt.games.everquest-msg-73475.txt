I had no problem with desktop crashing.  For a week and a half after SoL as
a matter of fact.  Then it just started and wouldn't stop.  I reformatted my
machine and had the same problem.  Then I read a small tech note on EQ's
website about changing a value in the eqclient.ini file that worked for me.

Find the value
loadluclinarmor17=TRUE

change it to FALSE and save it.  For some reason I guess this is causing
some machines to crash to desktop.  I've tried changing it back and it does
crash, so give it a shot.

Good luck,
Sean...
