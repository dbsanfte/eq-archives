I'm boggled. It never occured to me that tedium would be a primary (or
even desirable) goal for a game! I can only imagine being a fly on the
wall at a design meeting: "Okay folks, I got this idea for a riveting
MMORPG that's challenging and rewarding." "Nope, that sounds likely to
hold my interest. Could you make it more tedious?" Guess that shows you
what I know about game design...

Myself, I tend to skip the tedious bits as much as possible. I'll go out
for coffee while my cleric trains up his swimming in the pool in Kaladim.
I'll catch a good night's sleep while my bard is practicing Brass in Plane
of Knowledge. I'll lay on the floor and nap while crossing Ocean of Tears,
waking up at the sound of a backpack closing when the ship zones. I didn't
realize that the hours of tedium I was missing out on was such a big
selling point for the game.
