Click on the meat.  If it says "this is a meal, snack, hearty meal, or banquet
size meal" then it is food.  Chunk of meat is food.  Snake eggs are food.  
Wolf meat, bear meat etc. is NOT food, but can be turned into food.  (They are
kind of cool because they are stat foods.  If they are in your upper left slot
above all other food you get a strength or agility bonus.  See EQTRADERS for
some baking recipes.)
Fresh fish can be turned into fish cakes, which are nice because they are
banquet size meals, they last longer.
Also, ale, mead, beer, etc cannot be substituted for drink.  Water and milk are
cheap drinks.
