And it's hard, particularly, because EQ is above all a *game*, and most 
people play it *because* they already sit on their fucking butts all day 
at the office or at school, and are tired of it, and they don't create a 
Fantasy avatar to sit on their butts in Norrath too. And before you 
spout the tired "instant gratification" line, people play games because 
games are *about* gratification, and the faster that gratification comes, 
the better. They have enough of "delayed gratification" in their normal 
lives, thank-you-very-much.

The way EQ should work is, lower XP and loot per mob, and very fast mana 
and health regeneration when not in combat. Difficult to implement and 
perhaps exploitable, I'll be the first to admit, but not impossible. 
That's the job of the game designers, to figure out how to pull it off. 
Everquest is great not because it makes the punters sit on their behinds 
for ridiculous amounts of time, but very much in spite of it.
