My best advice here is to be careful when reading up on the Overking
raid. Most sources predate the retooling of Chardok. If they mention a
"safe camp," they're too old.

Oh, and when you go after the king, resist temptation to pull the
queen between spawns. She is *much* tougher than her husband and can
lead to a TPW of truly epic proportions.
