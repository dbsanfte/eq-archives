I have ADD, and know what problems are associated with it, I also am
aware of the benefits of learning to controll the condition without
chemicals.  To misquote Morpheus, "When the time comes you won't need to
dodge bullets"  He isn't smart or clever, or witty enough to have ADD.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
