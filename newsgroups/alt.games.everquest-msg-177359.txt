I agree 100%.  I hear (read) this "2000 is no good for games" all the time.
Well, in about 2 years or so running 2000, I've had less problems with my
computer than I had in an average week with 98.  And I have yet to find any
newer games that won't run on 2000.  I know there are some, and there were
many older ones that wouldn't run under 2000, but in my experince, 2000 and
EQ get along quite well with one another.
