<snip commentary comparing GB quest favorably to the old camp>


Yes, I agree that the quest is one of the better things they've tried.
They did make one humongous mistake tho, as the product of the quest
was tradeable, which resulted in a ghoulbane to paladin ratio nearing
1:1 as higher levels (especially druids, they seem to have a real
knack for designing paladin quests that are easy for druids to
complete) farmed the quest.  The player market price for Ghoulbane
dropped from 1500+ to around 300 in a fairly short period of time,
despite steady demand from paladin twinks and shadowknights doing
their epic.

What I would like to see would be quests that are made difficult in
some fashion that does not require bottlenecks involving rare spawns
that require 24x7 camps and create conflicts among players.  Something
like the GB quest that required rare NODROP components from a variety
of common dungeon/outdoor spawns would, IMO, be lots better than most
everything I've seen them try so far.  That way characters who wanted
the ItemOfLevelAppropriateUberness_01 could simply spend their time
hunting in the correct areas until they got the quest bits, and
casual players would not be pointlessly disadvantaged.
