Subject: Druid in a group not casting????

My level 25 shaman joined a gnoll group last week near splitpaw.  It was 2
tanks, a bard, my shaman and a druid.  The druid never cast a spell - except a
few sows.  She kept using melee attack.  Even when someone needed healing she
didn't heal.  Ever.  At no point did the group leader TELL her to play her
part.  She was between level 20 and 25.  
All I can come up with is that she bought the character???  As a group leader
isn't it your responsibility to take some action in a situation like this?
