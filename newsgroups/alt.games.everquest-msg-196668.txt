What's your bank account look like?  

I'd say you're doing pretty well, could use a little work in the HP 
department and you're going to want to get that DEX up soon.  

I wouldn't worry too much about your weapons until you're into your 50s 
(much as I don't like wurmslayers, they do a fair bit of damage).  

There's a lot of nice stuff coming out of LoY that may be in your reach.  

Might want to look into getting a silver chitin wrist band or maybe Ice 
Forged Shackles to replace your bracers (which isn't to say you should 
get rid of the tolan's bracer.  I lost track of how much I've spent on 
arrows between the time I ding'd 45 and got my tolan's bracer a LONG time 
ago).  Few bracers out of Umbral Planes you might want to look into as 
well.

Face piece can use some work.  If you're into time sinks and can get your 
guild together to take down Lodizal, you can go for an Eyepatch of 
Plunder.   Crystal Spider Eyes work well here also and shouldn't cost too 
much.

Keep the head piece until 55, at which point you should get a Helm of the 
Tracker (insanely easy quest if your guild can do Kael Arena).

Maybe a better haste item, but I think you've pretty much got the 
standard there pre-50.  They don't come cheap either.

Get an Earring of the Solstice put together, the stats should be much 
better than what you've got even at this point.

Start looking for a new neck piece when you hit 49 or so.  The number of 
spells you cast that BAM affects are going to drop off sharply.

At 51 you're going to want a better bow, since you'll actually be able to 
do some decent damage with one.  I like Twisted Longbow, but there's a 
lot of nice ones out there for that level.
