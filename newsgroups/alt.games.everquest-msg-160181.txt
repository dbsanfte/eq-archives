I have successfully gotten out with a baby Gnomish football with zero swim
skill, apart from the single point I got after falling in there in the first
place. The biggest hurdle people face is that of experience, as the way out
actually looks the hardest path. I have people who I have tried to help call
me an idiot for telling them the way out is the steeper "outer lip" when
they have been trying to climb the easy-looking "lower lip" on the centre
walkways for ages.

It's fun to lead a camel to water as they're dehydrated corpse's are most
amusing after they have refused to drink.
