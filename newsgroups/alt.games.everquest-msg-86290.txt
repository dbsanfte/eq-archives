For you maybe, for me this is only the second generation of MMORPG's.
I don't think free MUDs fall into the same classification at all.

Well that's your assertion. It's wasn't the character advancement
portion of UO that made Pvp such a pain it was Recall and superskills.
Better balancing of skills to create balances and counters with a
skill based system in a 3d environment is what people who are
interested in RvR want. If leveling in DAoC were easier and the
classes were balanced it would also fit the same role. 
I still think that is possible. Heck put me in charge of a DAoC server
for 3 months and I could make it possible.
