Would anyone else not be suprised if SOE put something in to conduct
this in a legit way? Seems SOE has been of the "If you cant beat em -
join em" mentality of late. Also this (in their minds I guess) would

"The Vision (tm)" has been beaten to a bloody pulp, this move wouldnt
suprise me (although I still wouldnt do it).
