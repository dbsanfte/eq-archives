Since you're not on Tarew Marr, it's safe to tell you this...

Go to Lake of Ill Omen.
Bloodgill Goblins.
Either quad kite (takes a bit of strategy) or root/rot (would recommend
starting out root/rot then quadding once you get the feel of the area)

Use harmony to break spawns (harmony BOTH goblins) for root/rot, for
quadding don't bother with harmony at all.

I can either root/rot 5 goblins (actually more like 4 1/2) before respawns
set in if I pull up onto land (safer) or up to 6 if I stay underwater (less
visibility and harder to avoid interrupts in casting), and due to the fact
that I'm killing them with mana free root, mana free drones of doom and only
casting Ensnare, Harmony and Immolate, I have about 4 bubbles of mana left
by the time respawns start.

Or I can quad one set, med to full, buff up, and med up to full again by the
time respawns start.
