I'm not sure about this - I think it's Higher Level * 2/3 rounded
down.  This explains the circumstance where my 'bot chanter
dinged 38 and was immediately able to group with my 58 mage and
get xp.

Lower level * 1.5 would have required him to make 39
(58.5 rounded to 58) to group.

My formula gives 58 gives 38.66 or 38 rounded down.  Using
this approach has explained every case of someone being able
to group a level earlier than the other formula predicted.

The reason I round down is that it seems all fractions (IME)
are rounded down in EQ.
