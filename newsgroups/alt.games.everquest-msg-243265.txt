Well think about it realistically from a business standpoint...IGE is making
money off of SOE's game. SOE can either put IGE out of business by a long
and convoluted lawsuit (only to have another one show up) or they can feed
them plat and items and reap a portion of the profits. I'm actually
surprised SOE hasn't started selling items and plat on their own. Can't get
that uber item in our game that you've wanted for so long? Don't have 3 days
to sit and camp a randomly spawning mob? pay us x dollars and we'll equip
you with it. Kinda like their "service" to move your character to another
server. Give us $50-$250 and you don't have to do the work of starting
another character on another server
