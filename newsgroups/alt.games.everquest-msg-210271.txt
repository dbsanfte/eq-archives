My new cleric just hit 25 in PC last night, so I too have been looking to
upgrade some of his equipment.  I personally say that a focus effect item is
well worth the few wisdom that a slot might otherwise give  you.  Focus
effects can make a huge difference in the quality and mana management of
your character.  PoK has a very easy quest for a mana preservation 2 ring.
You just need to get a high quality cougar pelt (look on vendors in
Iceclad), an undead froglock tongue(I see them on PoK merchants all the
time, but you should also be able to get one in the bazaar), a cockatrice
beak (common drop in DL or OT, expensive off merchants so try auctioning in
DL or OT, or try the bazaar), and a tiny rockhopper eye (Shar Vhal vendors
if you are in a hurry or just kill the rockhoppers in the pit in Shar Vhal
yourself, they will be green to you).  I have been hunting for an improved
healing 2 item, but sadly the options are limited.  The easiest to obtain
would be a Book of Obulus from the bazaar, you aren't getting one yourself
any time soon.  The PoK quest for the Fine Antique Veil, which has improved
healing 2, has drops from obscure camps that no one does so not much luck
buying the items in the bazaar.  I tried camping the stonegrabers in DSP
with my necromancer, and after 3 hours I still hadn't got the named one to
spawn.  I may give this quest another go, simply because I would rather have
my cleric carrying a shield rather than a book (though in the interests of
my party I may forego this detail).  One other item you may want to look
into is a batfang headband for extended enhancement 2, making all your buffs
last longer.  I found one on a vendor for 8p once, but I am not sure how
much they go for in the bazaar.  For spell haste I am using Djarn's Amethyst
Ring, not necessarily a cheap buy depending on your server, but it will last
you a while.  Good luck with your healer!
