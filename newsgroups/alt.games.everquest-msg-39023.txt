Actually I dont mind content being added for lower level players at all . I
welcome it wholeheartedly . What I mind is high level content being added
that only low levels can get or utilize . I mind when widget 435 is an
upgrade to the present equipment of many players and only players 28-30 can
get widget 435 . Even that though is a side issue for me , what grates so
hard on my nerves is twofold . First it destroys part of the role playing
feel of the world and the role playing feel is why I play this instead of
something else. The second thing is that it is so unneeded . It severs no
one at all except for the farmers and I dont really like them much, and it
can and will penalize everyone else , some of which I like a great deal.
