I'd give the 'summon corpse to body' to the necros/sks, not the clerics.

It would have a coffin component cost.

And see my previous comments about inter-zone summons... whereby it 
reduces the amount of the xp rezzed. So its a choice between a full xp, 
difficult CR and an expensive (in terms of pp and in xp) easy CR.

t one and do it again. I liked POP as well.
