If they ever unbreak it - one or another of the NPCs eats one or more
items (at least on The Rathe). No Ghoulbane is forthcoming, nor will a
/petitioned GM do anything about it, according to a guild member who
is now starting over on the annoying item collection phase and waiting
for further developments.

Your server (and his) may vary as to the status of the quest script,
but he should ask around before making those long, occasionally
dangerous, and time-consuming journeys.
