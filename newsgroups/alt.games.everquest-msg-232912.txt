XP home doesn't do well with networking I've heard.  So check to see
that you still have a network running.  If you can, go to a command
window (don't know if XP has one!) and do an ipconfig command.  It
should show the status of your network.  If you onlly see an address
of 127.0.0.1  then you only have a loop back in place.  
A second thing is to check your security settings.  I've seen virus
software kill networking but it usually comes back with a reboot.
