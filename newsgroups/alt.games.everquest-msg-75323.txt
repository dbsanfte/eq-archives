  I'm not sure what file you refer to, and if you manage to find it,
I'd be interesting in reading it as well.

  However, there's no one "story" to EQ.  There's the official
background stuff, but beyond that there is history and lore that you
can't generally learn any other way but playing the game (and being
observation/curious/inquisitive) or talking to someone else.

  One site I found that has a fair amount of background about Norrath
can be found here: http://savage.ranjoco.com/history.htm ... some of
this was released during the game's beta phase so I think some of it
might not be considered "valid" any longer.  Some of it is redundant
with stuff found on the official everquestlive.com web site, but
there's a a good amount of stuff there that isn't on the site or in
the manuals.

  Enjoy.
