If I was recommending an MMRPG I wouldn't recommend some knockoff fringe 
title... I'd pick one of the big ones. Similiarly until (if?) LoE proves 
itself I'd recommend new players will be best served by Warcraft or AoE. 
There is a bigger community, more mods, more maps, more opponents, etc. 
Even if the two titles were identical there is simply more value in the 
Blizzard and Microsoft offerings.
