Breath of Ro is good and it stacks with Winged Death.  WD will be your
main DoT though because Ro has resist issues.  Your fire Debuff will
help with those resists, but after you get used to WD almost always
sticking, Ro can get kind of irritating at times. :-)

Breath of Ro also has the added benefit of dropping mob AC by about
20, which can be helpful in group situations.  Not make or break, but
helpful.

Egress is self only, has a 5 second cast time, and only costs 100
mana.  Lesser Succor is a group spell that has a 10 second cast time
and costs 150 mana.  Also, according to Casters Realm, Lesser Succor
will suck 300 mana from everybody you bring with you on the port.

Anyway, HELL yeah Egress is worth it.  Very nice "Oh shit pulled too
many" spell.
