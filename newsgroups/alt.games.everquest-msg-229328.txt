OK, this dates back to yesterday.  But doing a who all 20/50, there were 
5 people, a level 21 mage, 3 level 20 mages, and a level 20 wizard.

All gnomes.  Not all in the same zone, which I expected, thinking that 
it was a group playing together.  Steamfont, Nektulous, Gfay each had at 
least one of these during the several times I checked.

Top level, of course, no idea who is on top in the PK field, for all I 
know its some level 6 person who stopped exping and does nothing but 
snipe other players who hit 6 all day long.

One ranger in the 6-50 range, a level 6 human in qeynos hills.

I didn't do a more through check to see what top levels were of the 
other classes, although I'm curious.

I -was- surprised to see a) ranger showing so poorly, and b) a Wizard in 
that company; I'd have thought wizards without snare and without a group 
(seems to be very little grouping going on) would really suck, bottom of 
the barrel.  c) no necromancers; 4 mages, zero necromancers, I'd have 
thought at least 50/50.  d) All gnomes.  No halflings (exp bonus), no 
trolls (regen should be a big advantage at low levels), no elves of any 
kind (by sheer volume, if the success of the classes were evenly spread 
out, you'd have to have 33% elves...Wood, High, Dark, Half?  Thats a lot 
of elf races!

Splendid
