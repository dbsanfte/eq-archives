I've read over the past week or so - how most people feel that the
introduction of the Plane of Knowledge and the Book transport system has
really spoiled Everquest, mainly by making the world feel small.

A possible solution to the books was used to great effect when Velious was
first released and you had to travel by boat and by foot etc to each of the
dragon rings to collect a tooth before a Wizard or Druid could port you
there.

I think it would help new players if they had to travel by foot/boat/etc to
each of the POK books and collect a no drop 'key' to unlock each particular
book before being allowed to use them as transport.

This would give new players a real sense of the size of the Everquest
world - bringing back things like the run through everfrost peaks to collect
the Halas 'key'. It would also help reintroduce the good/evil division in
the world.  For example want a key to the Neriak book but your a high elf,
then there is a real risk in making the run through the Dark Evles homeland
to collect your key.

Also all new characters would be still able to access POK from there home
city book - since the key for that book would require almost no effort to
acquire.

The keyed book system would also give all characters a sense of reward for
making the effort to travel to those out of the way place.

Just an idea - feel free to criticize
