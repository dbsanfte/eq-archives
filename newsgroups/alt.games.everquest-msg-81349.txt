For a newbie, trade skills can be a bit dull, (just swatches and thread) but
I think it will be fun when I finally produce a quality item and get to see
someone wear it.  It also adds another reason to kill things other than just
exp.  The other day I went up a level while I wasn't even watching cuz I was
so busy hunting spiders for silks.  It just gets your mind off leveling a
little.

A lot of people sell spider and spiderling silks to merchants, but then they
disappear from the Merchants window and are not available to buy. Is
something I learned the hard way.  I sold Pixie Dust to a merchant about 3
seconds before someone sent out a shout that they would pay 3pp for it.  I
tried to buy it back but it wasn't there- Bummer!

By the way, what is the going rate for spider and spiderling silks from
players?
