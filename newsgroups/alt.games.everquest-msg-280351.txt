With nothing pressing going on, I decided to take a tour of the changes, 
first to Grobb, then to Rathe.

As far as Grobb goes, it was a bit of an anticlimax.  Looks like all they 
did was point to an older version of the zone file.  The Carver is back, the 
dwarf on the Carver's block is back, the blood on the steps is back ... all 
seems to be as it was.  From a maintenance standpoint it makes sense, but 
from a game standpoint it seems a bit lacking given what all is supposed to 
have happened there.

Then I head over to Rathe with my druid.  16 people in the zone.  In the 
process of tracking down the frog camp, I hear rumblings:

"Where are the HGs?"

"WTF?"

"Now what are we supposed do do?  Damn SOE!"

As I come across the frog camp, I find it's behind Flat Rock.

Flat Rock is now covered in giant mosquitoes and larvae.  Pop up a track .. 
not an HG to be found.  No giant skellies either, for that matter.

To say that the farmers were a bit miffed is a bit of an understatement. :-P
