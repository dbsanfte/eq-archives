cash split sucks. it really only gives copper and silver which i
destroy anyway. if a group is looking for a "healer" then you should
be healing and if youre FM dont be shy about a nuke or snare or two.
if theyre looking for a "healer type" or a "sow class" then you can do
a lot more. if youre the only healer and melees keep hogging the loot
before you get a chance to loot then by all means get up and nuke
until youre OOM then melee until the mob drops then loot just like
they do. if they have a problem with it then complain that you dont
ever get to loot so you have to be up getting your share instead of
medding. theyll get the hint real quick
