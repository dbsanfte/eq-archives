I (heart) you.

I get guys talking about humping my leg a lot for some reason.  I usually
wind up skewering them or, if they're druids, having them neutered.  I'm
sure there's been a few times it was bad enough I shut the guy down, but
it's been a while.  My Enchanter gets treated with more respect than my
Warrior for some reason.  (Maybe because if the Chanter goes home, you're
all screwed? :D)

Even if he is, he's probably not playing under that name.  (I swear, I
remember seeing him somewhere.)
