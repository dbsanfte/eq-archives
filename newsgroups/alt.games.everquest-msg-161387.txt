I agree, a light source on top of IR does help.  But at the same time, I suggest you
make some 1st level characters of other races, and go check out their night vision in a
few zones.  Interestingly, there's a difference between half elf, wood elf, dwarf...
even though all three are "infravision" I think you'll see what I mean.  As a half elf,
you are still "half blind" compared to the other IR races.

So there we go, IR plus GLS lightsource is what the OP should be looking for.

Aye, they significantly reduced the degree to which night vision sucks for humans a
while back, but still, I'd look into at least a Glowing Stone Band to alleviate this
nuisance.

As a dwarf or Vah Shir, I've never noticed anything like your complaint in Luclin
zones.  I suspect its your part human heritage at work.
