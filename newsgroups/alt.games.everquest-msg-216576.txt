I agree that you can "fix" bad stat choices through careful gear
selection.  However it takes a lot of levels worth of saving your
coppers to fix 30 stat points spent in the wrong areas.  During
that time you may have a non-trivial handicap.  Sure, once you hit
50 or 60 or 65 your character may "fixed", but what a handicap and
annoyance until then.
