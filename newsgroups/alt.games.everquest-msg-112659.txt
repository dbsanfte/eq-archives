I noticed the same thing - I think that the double message occurs when
you use a lore item in the process. I tried several times to make the
claws, without success, but every time i got the two messages in
question, and combining returned the pattern - which is lore.

As for the skills needed, I got the handwraps at skill 16ish in five
or so attempts. The claws took two attempts at skill 27.

Good luck on your quest.
