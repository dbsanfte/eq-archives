Lance covered the AE snare already - which, in my opinion, gives us
the huge advantage for soloing.

Instead, I want to address the enchanter vs. wiz AE's at level 44.  By
44, most quadding wizards are still using the level 34 AE, circle of
force.  I believe CoF to be much better than Gravity Flux for
quadding.  Gravity Flux doesn't work there because when it resists, it
breaks the pack of mobs apart.  The quadder will need to spend time
regrouping all of the mobs together.  However, when CoF resists, the
mobs still remain packed together.

Druids are the only ones that can reasonably compete with wizards at
this level for quadding, given the types of snares that work. 
However, the druid nukes are less mana efficient and their round up
process is much slower.  I have done quadding for both, and found the
wizard quadding to be superior.

I believe necros are the only other class suitably equipped for
quadding (4 target AE nukes + snare), but I have never heard of a
quadding necro.  This is probably due to the lack of duration on their
snare.
