I can see your side of the picture, but I'm not sure if there is enough info
on DAoC yet to fully make comparisons.  For example, with quests I could
easily see the quest giver telling you to "find out about the sword of
power" (or whatever).  So in your little journal you have "find out...". No
real clear cut "go here, do that".  However we haven't seen all that DAoC
has to offer on that front.

For trade skills I'm sure there will be gathering as I doubt the "best"
materials are going to be straight store bought.  Maybe I'm wrong (I'm by no
means a DAoC expert), but it seems like the higher level stuff could be
either mob dropped or quest results.  And learning a new recipe from a
scroll, boke, tome, etc.. seems very probably with the format.  It also gets
rid of the tedious trial and error on trade skills.  For example the Wu
armor (not gloves, but the rest) was found through experimentation.  Only
afterwards was the scroll with the recipe added.  That is PURE frustration
for a tradeskilled, b/c that means I need to do every possible combination
after Every patch to see if something was added.

I haven't had a lot of experience with CR in DAoC (yet), as I'm only lvl 5
so I can't comment on that.

Although, the prospect of never losing a level is very comforting.

I think DAoC has great potential, and appears to be made to be built upon.
Lets hope it lives up to its promise.
