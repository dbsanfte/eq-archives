Nope... but the pet won't have agro.. the necro will. Just standard
agro kite.. mob tries to get to the necro.. necro stays out of range..
rogue hits and backstabs along with the pet and if done properly
can't generate enough agro to turn the mob away from the necro. Fear
kiting isn't an option at the high levels.
