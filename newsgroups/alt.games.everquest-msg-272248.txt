The dye also depends on the armor's color.  If it's neutural, your dye
color will show well but if it's colored (ie green) then your dye will
be mixed with the armor's color.

2 ways to get around that depending on the armor's color: adjust the
dye until the resulting color looks good or find a different armor
piece that doesn't have color.  White is a hard one to get on many
armor pieces.  I usually end up dying my armor in dark color so I can
keep the best pieces and not worry about ugly or uneven colors.
