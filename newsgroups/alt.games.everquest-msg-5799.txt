Last night I died in the Karanas... which is not as rare an event as I
would like.  This time, however, I was killed by 3 swarmlings who
ganged up on me as I was finishing off a giant beetle.  I had no
chance, and I see that I am near the guard tower, so I run there...
only to find the guards indifferent to my plight, and sat there
laughing as I was pinched to death.

Well, not really laughing.  But has anybody else noticed that these
Swarmling buggers are evidently not on the guards KOS list?  Is this
an oversight?

If nothing else, this should serve as a warning to those of low enough
level to be endangered by the little bastards.
