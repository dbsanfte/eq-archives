Very simple. Go into raid mode (clipping plane to zero, every lag
inducing option turned off) and zone into the bazaar.

type in /bazaar

In the search window, narrow it down by class = necro, race = dark elf,
and stat = INT or Mana, or just leave that part blank. When you star the
search, you'll see everything usable by you and you can start right
clicking on the things in your price range and see what are upgrades for
you. Right click on the vendor names to turn yourself towards them.
Track them down and buy them.
