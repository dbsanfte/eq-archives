A variant of your #2 is that you can create cash with tradeskills by buying
items from vendors and crafting something that the vendor will buy back for
more than the cost of the components.  VI has nerfed most of these, but a
few still exist.  I think you can make a few k per hour in high level
fletching.

One trivial thing I've always wondered is what is the highest price a vendor
will pay for any item? I think the highest gem is a blue diamond, around
240pp, then there's forest loop, close to 300pp, and lots of Kunark class
armor sells for over 300pp, but I don't know of anything else (bags of plat
for returning horses don't count!).
