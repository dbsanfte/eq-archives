So, since the use of steroids goes on in sports, the Baseball
commission should just start selling the drugs to players, since they
can't stop it and everyone does it?

Great logic, there.

Got nothing against making money -- terminal laissez-faire capitalist
here -- but SOE is ignoring that they are marketing a game, not a
virtual world. Fortunately, because this IS a capitalist society,
there is competition, and selling intangibles such as "a level playing
field" is part of a business model. I'll take my money elsewhere, and
leave SOE to their incipient disaster. (Short summary -- no one will
move to the Exchange servers except those looking to make money by
selling goods. Since no one will be buying (except as speculators) the
market will collapse quickly and the servers will be empty inside of a
year. This will lead to SOE either breaking their promise and making
ALL servers Exchange servers, or shutting down the experiment. The
'underground' market on non-exchange servers will flourish, causing
SOE to save *no* money on CS costs. Indeed, by making it seem
'legitimate', it will probably get even worse.)
