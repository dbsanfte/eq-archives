The price isn't absurd if the reason for the price is to discourage
moves.  However, going naked and broke sucks.  What I would have liked
to see is for their to be two options.  Option #1 would be naked and
broke for $50.  Option #2 would be to pay $50 to have a GM on the
server you are going to review your account and decide what you can
take.  You can then either go ahead and transfer, for $50 with your
items, you cancel, and get $25 of your $50 back.

Also, Verant should publish on the web all moves between servers,
listing character name, origin server, and new server.
