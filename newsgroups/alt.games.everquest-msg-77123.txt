As a human druid (I know, very rare combo) I use it whenever I want to
see at night, as wolf gives me infravision.  Back in the bad old days
when night was REALLY dark no matter what you did, wolf was a godsend.
 It's less critical now but still handy.

Other thing is that higher level wolf form lasts almost forever.  I've
never timed it but I'm sure it's over 2 hours.  I've only had it wear
off on me a couple of times.
