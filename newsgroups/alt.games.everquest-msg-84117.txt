Up the gamma slider in game and up the gamma in your desktop
properties if you have the ability to do so. I have the nvidia drivers
for tnt/geforce cards I got from www.nvidia.com and they have a
setting for that under color correction.

Eq is by default very dark on some vid cards. Even with my dark elf or
wood elf I make sure my desktop gamma is set to like 3.60 before
getting in game.


>2. My mouse is slow. It happens to lag behind my hand movements. Any idea.

Up the mouse speed in game, up the mouse speed in control panel. If it
still does you have graphics lag.
