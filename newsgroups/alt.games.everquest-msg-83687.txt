I find this hard to believe.  First, 3 minutes is barely
enough time to be useful, period.  It would almost take
a Cleric that long to respond to a tell, sometimes.

Second, I've had dueled corpses Revived at least an hour
after dueling, and it wasn't "a long, long time" ago.

Third, I have personally Revived dueled corpses after 
people had been hunting around for a Revive for a
considerable period of time.

Not to say that it's not possible, but it certainly
goes against my experience (not counting the one case
I mentioned in my post).  I'll run some tests
tomorrow and see.

Furthermore, the same evening that my corpse timer
seemed to run out prematurely in TD, our buffs had
all been fading *far* more quickly than we felt they
should (a SoW barely lasted long enough to run from
Ogre Island to the Firepot room), *and* a fellow was
shouting that his corpse had poofed in the zone
after only about twelve hours -- all these seem to
point to some sort of server or zone clock running
too fast.

I would think even the 3 hour limit would be enough to put a
crimp in most plans of that sort.
