    One of the best quests of that sort is the Rogue epic quest for
Ragebringer. You have to pickpocket two rogue guildmasters (one dwarf, one
Teir'Dal, so some trickery will likely be required), sneak into Hate to get
a ground spawn book, sneak behind the Teir'Dal in Kith to summon the General
for the final battle, and if you're really into roleplaying, there's two
"alternate endings" that result in the High Elf illusion mask, or the Fanged
Skull Stiletto.
