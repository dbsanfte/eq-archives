Didn't realize you played the euro server. I have no doubt that was
more uncomfortable.

How does the game really change if leveling is easier or harder? Is
the fun in the leveling?

There are many accomplishments to shoot for and not all of them are
simple or time-consuming.

But i'm with you 100% on the death thing, though it's silly in all
games except the first 1/2 of eq1. Still, just because the penalty
isn't dire doesn't mean it isn't an improvement (albeit silly). If
your party dies while creeping through a dungeon, you have to start
from the beginning. You're not as connected to your avatar,
admittedly; they're transient and you, the player, are trying to beat
a level, the same as in every other video game. That's what it is,
really.

If the role-playing (connection to avatar) is more important to you,
play an eq classic server or play a game where "death" means actual
death. Some game where you can't play your character after dying
unless you are revived. Is that more fun? It's always silly, and the
fact that the "video game" version of punishment is cheaper here is
not worse than it is in any other game.
