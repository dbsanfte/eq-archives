The economy wont change much, yes the prices will rise some in the 
beginning, but the thing you are all missing is that it will cost someone 
who is not specialized, say an armorer making studs, twice the fuel, hence 
twice the cost to produce the item.  People will still buy from their 
regular sources, but you will have the option to make it yourself at an 
increased cost.

The part that I think will hurt us is the tiered fuel.  T5 fuels are 15s36c 
each, a 15s 30c increase, so if you make for example a platemail chestpiece, 
the cost would be prohibitive if you were to make all the combines yourself, 
you will be much better off buying the components.

For one Plate chest: 38 fuel (16 X 2 for non armorer items + 6 for the 
items you can make) is required, so 5g 83s 68c  just for the fuel. 
definitely cost prohibitive.

The only crafters unaffected by this will be provisioners since they have no 
interdependency.
