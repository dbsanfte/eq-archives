It is faster, and can be used if youre 100% sure youre not gonna attack 
or cast while runnign form place to place (through SK for example).

Also found it great for buff beggars. If someone ask for a sow for a CR 
i cast on them, since this will get them to their corpse faster, thus 
helping them more than with a regular sow. If they were just trying to 
fake a CR to get a sow, they get a nasty surprice when they attack their 
first mob.
