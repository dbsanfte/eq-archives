The second thing.  I get bored of farming *really* fast, and it's
not profitable to buy the spiderling silks and low quality skins
from the bazaar and do the combines and sell the resulting leather
padding.

All told I've probably only performed 100 combines after jump starting
my tailoring skill by combining spiderling silks (a "no fail" combine
that'll get you to the mid-teens, if memory serves).  Not enough to
draw any solid statistical conclusions, as you've observed.

That's Mr. Perpetual Noob to you, mister!  :)
