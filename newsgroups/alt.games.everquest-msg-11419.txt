Spotted this guy in South Karana just to the southwest of Vhalen
Nostrolo's well near 0,0. As he is red to me at 39, it kinda got me
wondering who/what this guy is. I checked several of the websites but
the most I got was spotting his name on a list of NPCs for the zone
that had no descriptions attached.

Given the name, I am assuming he's a Bard of some sort. Anyone know
more?
