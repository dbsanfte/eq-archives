Lev is usually a very good tool against knockbacks.

Theres like 6 guards that are so spread out they can be single pulled by any 
class.  If 2 come they are mezzable.  Then caller is targetable, but spawns 
2 helpers (on pull) which can be mezzed but are somewhat resistable too.  So 
what happened when we did it is chanter bit it and bard (finally) got them 
mezzed.  It could be done with one good group, or 2 to be safe.
