Odd as that may sound there may be something to that. I went back to garg
island last night and it was fully populated with gargs. I kept track of the
eye drop rate and at first it was nine eyes for ten gargs killed, all but
one drop being two eyes. After cleaning the place out, when I was waiting
for gargs to respawn and killing them as they did, the rate went to down to
one eye per four gargs killed. Coincidence? Probably. Anyway I ended up with
a full stack of eyes for about three hours work. So at least last night the
gargoyle gravy train was back in town.

As for the price, someone questioned that I was being ripped off. The wood
elf on sister island regards me "warmly" (she should after all the CrushBone
Orcs I've killed) and buys the eyes for 8.5plat and some change. I have the
base charisma stat for a high-elf. Perhaps I could do a little better taking
them to a high-elf vendor. I'm on a newer server so prices aren't what they
are on the older servers (example: norm for stein of moggok is 100p). So if
someone offers me a small premium while I'm just sitting around medding,
I'll take it. Saves me trying to /action things which I hate to do. Plus I'm
level 20 so even 8p per eye is fairly big money to me.
