Uhhhh. 'key. Maybe its a cultural thing but in the UK people wouldnt
think you were religious if you were an atheist biblical scholar or
historian, for example.

And the point is that makes no sense. It 'is', but that doesnt mean
its right - its like trying to rationalise the ability of wolves to
walk through walls.

Sure. Even the planes of power manual, which is the most recent
expansion I bought, describes the cleric as 'calling upon the wrath
of her deity to smite her foes.' The shadowknight is described
as deriving his power from the evil god he serves. 4 years of
playing EQ left me with no reason to imagine this was a 'primus
have no idea what they're talking about' type occurance.

You can try to justify it however you want, but it seems to be a pretty
clear rewriting of history to me.
