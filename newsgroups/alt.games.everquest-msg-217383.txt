No, the rez won't really help. You'll end up by
your corpse and no enduring breath so you'll probably
just die again before you can cast it on yourself.

Find someone who knows the area pretty well and
can cast enduring breath on themselves (or you can
cast it on them) then you can consent them to drag
your corpse to you (out of the water, preferably).
Post your server and maybe there's someone here
that could help you out. For instance, Karana server
and I'll go find it for you.
