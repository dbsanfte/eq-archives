Maybe.  Does the MT ever switch targets and NOT want the raid to follow him?
The original message implied that this was the case.

I've generally seen them be two different people, because even when the MT is
always on the main mob, he's got too much to worry about already, and his
lifespan is sometimes in question, so it's easier to have someone unlikely to
get aggro controlling where raid DPS goes.  

On a lot of fights, there's no particular reason to have MA and MT be
different people, except it gets folks more involved and on their game to know
how important the different roles are.

The MT can tell the MA when to call for assist.  If they're the same person,
that's a little easier.  HOWEVER, it means that the MT now has to switch if
the raid DPS should switch.  This is normally a bad plan.  In some fights,
there are adds that should be burned down ASAP when they appear.  The MT stays
on the boss, because he has aggro and is getting healed.  The MA switches to
the new target, calls for reassist, and it goes down.

Depends on your audience, I guess.  It sounded pretty condescending to me, but
it probably does bear repeating.  I wonder if it would be more effective to
send a few different messages - a "discipline is killing us on this mob,
here's what we're doing to improve it" and a "why is waiting to assist
important" message.
