 Well you and I have been playing for the same amount of time but you too
are probably a higher level then me cause I've come to the conclusion that I
have a lot too learn about EQ. In other words, at this time I kinda suck at
being a Shadow Knight

 First thing I learned that may help you was that "Just because he/she is a
level 54, does not mean he/she is actually an experienced player".

Why you may ask ?

Ebay.com  that's why.
 So far I have not had to put anyone on ignore, yet I did participate in the
booting of two players so far. Not proud of it, nor happy that they got
banned. But verbal abuse in the game should be a simple policy too follow.
I've had my moments of anger, and many an NPC paid dearly for my
frustration.

Oh, and their was the time some guy called me a Twinkie and I ACCIDENTALLY
trained a Griffin to him and his smarty pants friend and then I ACCIDENTALLY
Shadow Stepped, watching the Griffin kill both of them. It took me almost 11
seconds to get over that one. But its in the past now :-)
