Erm I think you could possibly argue fraud - you dont have the legal right
to pass said information on therefore by selling it you are selling
something you dont have the right to and can claim back at any time by
phoning SOE so you aint actually selling what you say you are. Oh and
since you arent authorised to access the SoE site if you buy it then you
could argue a number of criminal offences under authorised access
regulations....bribing your way is covered by this.

At a practical level then I think you are right - if the money is comign
in to them then its unlikely to be enacted but I do think DT is right on
the technicalities.
