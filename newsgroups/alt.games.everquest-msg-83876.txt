Well, you are allowed 8 characters per server per account...

So that is upwards of over 100 characters you could potentially have on one
account... only 8 on any one given server...

But if you want to play together... then yes, you need multiple computers
with multiple accounts... no different then many other games out there

If you wanted to play diablo 2 with 2 people, you need 2 computers, 2
accounts (online that is)

same goes for just about any other multiplayer online game.
