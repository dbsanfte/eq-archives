Hmmm, I have a skill in the 180's in Alchemy.  I have my Grandmaster's
Trophy in alchemy.   The only title available to me is Apprentice Alchemist
(the only one for this trade, I do have others)

Am I reading correctly that when I hit a skill of 200 that I will get the
option to use the title of Journeyman Alchemist?  I have seen some people
running around with "Expert Chef" as a title, and that's what I would like
for myself.... "Expert Alchemist".   However, the skill cap for alchemy is
200 (maybe 205 now, not sure) is there not a way to become an expert in
alchemy, or does anyone know if this skill has a different set of number
requirements for the titles?

Thanks in advance,
