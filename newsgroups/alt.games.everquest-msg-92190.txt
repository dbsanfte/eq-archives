LOL, good for you wee fellah.

Meanwhile the rest of us had jobs and stuff that make decent cash, not
pocket money. Just dont spend it all on sweeties.

But I still dont understand, why is flogging an account for "phat lewt"
better than a developer harvesting the returns from their investment with an
agressive pricing strategy?

I seem to remember a questionaire some time ago, asking if people would be
willing to pay for such a server - well, it looks llike the results are in -
YES!

I doubt they are gambling on this, so far Sony/Verant seem to play a pretty
good financial game.

And like most others here my opinion is...who cares, if you want it ..pay
for it, if you cant pony up the cash - quit yer bitchin, dis' server aint 4
j00. (or something).

PS. has anyone actually played on stormhammer yet? I am interested to know
what its like!
