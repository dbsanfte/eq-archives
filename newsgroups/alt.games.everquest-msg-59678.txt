Tizmaks in GD are not that bad, i solo there now at 26, hard like
..... but i like it anyway, velium weapons sell for close to 4pp in
town that is right next door, the velium morningstar a bit more, the
warrior can be bound in town and the CR from thurgadin to the tizmaks
is as close to safe it can be, in thurgadin you have a bank the
library and many places for tradeskills, even thurgadin mines.

For me as a necro this place can be hard because of no reliable lull
spell to singel pull from cave entrance, i will have to go for the
wandering tizmaks, and finding a partner is next to impossible
