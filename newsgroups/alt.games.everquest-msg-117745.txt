same as i felt!!!

gotta try dungeons then

my suggestions (as a Pally which swayed me!!)

1 - TOFS in iceclad
2 - Lguk (live or deadside)

both these have great xp and loot (TOFS in particular is a real challenge
the likes of which i haven't had since unrest!!!! , it's what the game
shoudl be like imho

just my tuppence worth (neither of the above are exactly "natural" Shaman
teritory!!!

cheers and good luck
