You've got me a bit confused here Dennis.  First you ackknowledge the
rather substantial difference in ATK between Knights and the rest of the
melees, then you say that Knights can outdamage epic Ranger?  Is this
from parsed logs?  against difficult targets (i.e. not green cons)?
One thing I've noticed about Enchanter haste, is that my WPS (whiffs
per second) can climb remarkably high using a one-hander with VoG.

Kaev <--- very much wants one of those "weapons that drop off mid-range
gimp raid targets", but ain't gonna hold his breath until he gets one
