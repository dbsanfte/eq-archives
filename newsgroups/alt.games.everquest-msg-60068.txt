Woohoo!  

Went with a group of Guildies to the Dreadlands the other day and I
actually was able to successfully do crow control with the Charm song!
Those giants became my bitches.  :-)

The high level spiders did not.  :-(  I'd get a message saying
something to the effect that they were too high of a level for my
Charm song.  What's the cap?
