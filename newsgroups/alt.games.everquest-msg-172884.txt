Weren't we talking about pickup groups?  And the SMR is a decent caster 
robe.  If you're not twinked up the ass, you may still be able to use 
it.  If not, it still goes for 4k in the bazaar, and owning a rogue, I 
wouldn't try and jump in and claim it for myself in a pick-up group.  
I'd get a group of guildies/friends and go in specifically for that.

Of course, I already have my SMR, seeing as I foresaw the need for one, 
saw a guy selling for 3k, and bought it so my necro could wear it until 
he needed it.
