With my enchanter we had a very successful team with a beastlord and his
pet.
It is important that everyone knows how to work with mez, and that the
beastlord pays attention to what his pet is up to...


So my key point is: ALWAYS PAY ATTENTION
It's as simple as that. :-)

P.S:
I just fished this out of my logfiles:

Group discussion just after I had been killed:
VK tells the group, 'ouch'
SH tells the group, 'she droped so fast'
BB tells the group, 'did mez wear off?'
SH tells the group, 'it must have right has I hit it so it went after her'
(Translation: mez must have worn off right after I hit it)
Now, this from a lvl 40 character... *shiver*
