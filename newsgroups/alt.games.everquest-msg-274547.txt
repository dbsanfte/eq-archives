I have to agree on this one, if I'd had a problem with one of my guys 
saying bastard I'd just ask them to be a little cleaner (actually they 
know I'm a grumpy sod so I'd tell em to hush or I'll slap them about but 
it amounts to the same thing ;-)) but I wouldn't use it as the basis for 
de-guilding.

I do, however, have a point to add, related to the "bite me :p". I can't 
explain why but I've never gotten on with the :p emoticon because unlike 
:) and ;), I always associate it more with "Get lost, I couldn't give a 
stuff" than with the "I'm just teasing, please don't take offence" which 
I get from the other two smileys.

Just my tuppence-worth :-)
