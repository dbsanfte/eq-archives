I dont usually play a pet class, because I felt it wasnt complete.  The new
UI really makes this much better.  You know have you own pets health bar, as
well as a small green health bar under yours to track your pets if you
choose to close the small pet menu window.  They also have the general pet
functions already set up, very nice.
