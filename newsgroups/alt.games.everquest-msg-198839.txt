Yes.
Go through the gate, and on the other side of the main building is a 
small, gated hut. Click on the gem inside the hut to get into CC.

No, but just use invis and you will be fine.

They are, but they dont see invis.

Not sure on this one, (I think everyone starts out apprehensive) but 
killing the orcs inside CC will improve your faction with the Coldain in 
CC. Its very handy to be able to bank and sell in CC, since the sellable 
drops are extremely good at your level.
