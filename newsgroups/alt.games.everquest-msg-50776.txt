Interesting idea. I started tailoring on my druid for the very reason you
mention. During the early days there were horror stories of people losing
everything due to bugs and impossible corpse recoveries, even happened
to a few guildmembers. I was so scared of losing my stuff that I started
making sure I could tailor and at least replace all my armor quickly.

It would be easier for my spell casters since I could kite and root/nuke/dot
without ever having to get near my prey. Then I could also use my skills to
sell stuff and recoup money that way as well. I think I could have my stuff
back where I was within say 2 months.
