They take a LOT less damage.  Rogues tend not to tank mobs because
they are somehow perceived as weak defensively and it kills their DPS
however this doesn't mean that they aren't actually quite capable of
doing it.

Check up on Shaman defense caps (200 defense just doesn't cut it, I
know this from bitter bitter experience with my Ranger) and put them
against  the Rogue caps.  The difference, as it should be between a
melee class and a priest class, is staggering.  If it weren't for that
one Monk unbalanced defensive ability (my memory fails me, I think it
is Block) then they'd probably be the best tanks behind the plate
trio.

This makes Shaman acceptable as off tanks as they aren't dependent on
any other person to make sure the mob is slowed so by extension most
times they tank a mob it IS slowed just like most times I tank a mob
it is Ensnared.
