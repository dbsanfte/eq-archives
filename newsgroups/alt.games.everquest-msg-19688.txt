Hehe, if people act like idiots its just good to see them end up dead. I play
on a non-pvp server, so we need to use other options to get revenge.
Had a level 10 monk idiot in WFP trying to threaten me to lower my price on Wu
armor, or else he would tell his guild (was guildless, did a /who), and he
would shout out that noone shoud buy from me. Took him with me to Freeport for
a PC so he could see my prices was normal price, and after a PC gave 10pp more
than my price he told me i was wierd, and put me on ignore list.
After that i did of course ask the other Wu seller in the area if he had also
taked to this guy, and it turned out that he had tried to threaten 3 persons
into lowering prices.
But since most tailors talk, to compare prices and so on, it now have the
effect that all the Wu sellers in freeport wont sell to him, so he cannot get
Wu armor unless some new tailor come show up, or he can get a tailor to custom
make it for him (but at his idea of Legs at max 100pp (go for 200 on veshaan)
i doubt that will happen.
