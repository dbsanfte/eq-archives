He said he can't see the names at all, that has nothing to do with
/shownames as you can get the game to show a little or a lot that way, but
not nothing.

The actual setting for that is adjusted in the Options window (alt - O
iirc), where it says on two of the buttons:

"Show PC Names"
"Show NPC Names"
