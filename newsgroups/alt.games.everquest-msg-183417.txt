I've seen the server kill someone for no apparent reason.  We wiped in Halls
of Testing once, and we were recovering by summoning corpses to the zone in
for resing.  Some of us who had been resed were standing around at the hub,
waiting for everyone to get ready to go back in, when one of our Clerics
simply dropped dead.  He had been one of the people who had died and been
resed, so there was no chance that there was any lingering DoT on him (does
anything have nasty DoTs in HoT?).  All those of us standing near him saw
was "Soandso dies".  That's all he saw on his screen, too.
