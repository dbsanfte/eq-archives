You know what site you are, and I will not promote you by listing it in this
post. It is nice that you have a site dedicated to ppl with alot of money
and no playing ability.  Promoting the selling of accounts only promotes
high lvl newbies. Most ppl assume that when they group with a lvl 47 *insert
class here*  that they know how to play that class.  Knowing how to play
your class effectively does not come with a fat bank roll, but with grouping
with ppl, asking questions,  and getting killed alot in the lower lvls by
making mistakes.        On a personal note:  Do I mind getting killed and
losing xp in a train?  not really, it is part of the game.  Do I mind losing
experience points cuz some Ebayer who has no idea how to pull caused that
train?  YES.     I think many ppl will agree with me on this one.  There
will be a few that do not agree with me, so feel free to post replys ( we
have free speech, might as well use it )     = )
