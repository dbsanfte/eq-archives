Listen to yourself once.

"I just figured..."   look up the mistake in order to LEARN something.
"...the extra .2 seconds..."  refer to above suggestion.
"...type "you're" so..."  YOU'RE on a ball here thus far.
"...so that you..." are you getting the point yet?

Attempting to correct another person's grammar in the newsgroups always has
a way to bite you in the ass later.  I won't bother mentioning what happens
when you are critical on top of that.  Just read the frickin post and go
about your way.

<shurg>  Just some friendly advice for you.  BTW, you might want to get your
blood pressure checked.
