That may be so, but for most of that time you'll be grouping. THAT is 
where your rep is made. Think I give a flying fig someone got raped in a 
trade they did NOT initiate? Nope. Run screaming from your group for no 
reason resulting in multi-death? Hell yeah you're on MY shit list. And 
if that happens regularly then they WILL be placed on others. Also, ANY 
guild that checks one of those boards for that kind of foolishness 
without actually GROUPING with prospective initiates is definitely not a 
guild I want to be associated with.
