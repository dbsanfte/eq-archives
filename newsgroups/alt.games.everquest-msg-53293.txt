Heh. I remember that. I soloed 3 levels in there looking for those boots,
one of them was a hell level and most of the Berserkers were green to me. In
the time it took me to get Zorash to finally drop a pair I had gotten 3
Sarnak Earrings of Station, 2 Sarnak Ceremonial daggers and a huge amount of
Tabards and swords. For the boots having to do 2 rare drops from rare spawns
is just plain stupid. Grachnist is not so bad because there is usually a
high level slaughtering for the gob skull earring and totems so they will
usually let you loot the skull if it drops. No one hunts Zorash and he is
only spawns about every 2 hours. Very frustrating. Now getting the wings off
Lady Chormiore is a real pain in the ass.
