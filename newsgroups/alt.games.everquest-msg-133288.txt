    On a failed Emperor attempt, your only hope is if you camped far back in
an alcove as he has room-wide aggro in line-of-sight. He stays up for long
enough that waiting for him to despawn is not practical, and as we've found
out corpse draggers will more than likely move him to a point where he can
both see in the alcove and chain that aggro off to the offtank mobs which
are now back in position. So when we call the fight, the raid leader calls
"GATE" and anyone that can get out does. Everyone who died gets a summons
(the necromancers never die as they aren't in the room, they Levant to zone
to start summoning).

    Besides, it can be a fun game trying to get out. He has massive
proximity aggro, so I can frequently escape by stepping behind the other
clerics before casting Gate. It's like a game of chicken - who will stop to
cast Gate first, and who will keep on backing up before casting (and risk
getting summoned)?
