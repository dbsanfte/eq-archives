If this is the 'real' Brad M, then I just want to say the following:

Thank you for all of your hard work and effort. You (and the rest of
the development teams) have given me countless hours of enjoyment over
the past 2+ years. The new expansion promises to make EQ even better
than it already was, once the bugs are ironed out.

Good luck in your next project!

Cheers
