I have to admit to getting hooked on DBZ once, during a period of 
unemployment. I remember one occasion where the good guys are fighting 
that white and purple guy with a tail, on a planet that will explode in 
exactly five minutes. They managed to stretch those five minutes over 
four or five 30-minute episodes. No question that it's mindless and 
stupid, but it's also pretty clever, in its own mindless and stupid way. ;-)
