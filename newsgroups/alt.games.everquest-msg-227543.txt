No, Lance, you pretty much said.... Of course it doesn't work.  Which reason
do you think is why?

I've written quite a bit on this in the other three threads on the subject.
At this point, I'm going to say you should probably go read and respond to
some of those.  I grow tired of repeating myself.

Often.   I don't even know what drops at a particular camp, a lot of the
time.  I don't generally research mob drops at Allakazams without a reason
that would justify the amount of effort.

No.   Generally people don't sit around saying "Level XX warrior looking for
group, X camp only please!"  A zone preference maybe, but thats hardly the
same thing.  Never once has "Join me in XX zone" been responded to with
"What camp are you at?" or "What drops there?"

Yes.

Or perhaps just a bit less paranoid.   A constant theme throughout your
messages has been that everyone must be abusing this, since it's so easy to
abuse.   You really went off the deep end in the one where you suggested
that the only reason you could make a friend by awarding someone a NBG drop
was because you allowed them to rip you off.
