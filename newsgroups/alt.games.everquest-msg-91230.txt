What I would do is have a hotkey that does /guildstatus. Then at the end
of a grouping session I would quickly do F2 <hotkey> F3 <hotkey> F4
<hotkey> F5 <hotkey> F6 <hotkey>. Vaguely keep track of the names. If
you see the same guildname cropping up over and over, attached to people
that were good groupmates, then that's a guild to investigate further.
