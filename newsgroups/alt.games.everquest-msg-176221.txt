What level charm are you talking about?  At level 27, the charm should
last no longer than 18 seconds.  At level 39, the charm can last up to
1 minute.  When I need to break charm, Hide works about 75% of the
time for me.  If you can afford to give up a song slot, I would have
the Invis song up and use that to break the charm.  Using the invis
song will work every time to break a charm unless you can't start the
song for some reason.
