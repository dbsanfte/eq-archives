I have started a Shaman a long time ago, a female barbarian, who is now at
lvl 25. I also started a Wizard now at lvl 14, and a Warrior, now at level
10.

I have decided to fill all 8 character slots, and yesterday I started up 5
more characters, and all leveled them to at least level 2. So now I have all
8 slots filled with the following characters, both female as male:

Female Babarian Shaman, lvl 25
Male Gnome Wizard, lvl 14
Male Barbarian Warrior, lvl 10
Female Half-Elf Bard, lvl 3
Male Halfling Druid, lvl 2
Male Dark-Elf Necromancer, lvl 2
Female High-Elf Cleric, lvl 2
Male Erudite Enchanter, lvl 2

As you can see the last 5 chars are hardly worth mentioning.... My goal is
to get them all to level 6 first, (to prevent quick corpse decay so i can
actually quit the game when I die) and then all to level 10. When they all
are around level 10 I plan to have them all based around FreePort, and hunt
to about 18 in Nro and Oasis. So basicly I plan to have an army of roughly
the same lvl chars :)

I do plan to level my 25 shaman further, so she will still remain my main. I
have only lightly twinked the wizard with some low to mid lvl INT items, the
rest is completely untwinked. I'm not even planning on transfering any items
to the lower lvl chars to at least lvl 6. A friend of mine twinked his lvl 1
warrior to the MAX with multiple thousands of pp worth of stuff, and he
died..... while running towards his corpse his ISP acted up, and he couldn't
get a connection.... after about 20 minutes he freaked and ran over to me,
only to find out I had the SAME isp, and could not get a connection
either....Needless to say he lost his corpse and all his stuff. Neither will
i travel too far from bind point because of the same reason. Also as you can
see i have 3 females and 5 males in the list, while being a male player.

I'm just wondering what you think of my gameplay. Does anyone have comments
about it? Do you think it is a good idea to have a few (i think the last 5 i
made) characters roughly the same lvl in the same area so you can fullfill a
groups needs? Am i being crazy because its gonna take 5 times the work to
get the whole bunch up to a certain level again? I think it will be very
fruitfull in a few months from now... Comments are welcome.
