I will be reformatting my C: drive and reinstalling Windows again but this
is the first time I am doing this since having EQ.  What files should I
save? I want to keep all my hotkeys and what not so I dont have to remake
them.  Also I edited one file to be able to see the Velious armor and would
like to keep that one so i dont have to redo it.

Thanks
