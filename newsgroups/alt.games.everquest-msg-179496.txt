As I understand it, currently there are no faction hits for killing
the frog NPCs. I'm sure this will be changed very shortly, of course.
Not surprised people are camping the guards. 

1) New NPCs will always be farmed to see what loot they have so long
as they're killable
2) Troll players are bitter over losing their "home" and venting on
the froggies, even if it means loggin in alts to do so.
