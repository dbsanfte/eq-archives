<eireannstar@earthlink.net> (if that IS his real name) disgorged:

>Believe what u will... it was my first character and yes someone DID give me
>most of the set of "dyed red no less" fine plate and I worked my butt off to
>get the other pieces made for me. Perhaps you just weren't working hard
>enough to build up your armor and maybe you were just such an ass in game no
>one was nice to you. BTW you can get the stuff to dye it colors right off
>the ground in steamfont so "dyed red no less" is not an issue when you
>provide the dye stuffs to someone who makes the pieces for you. The hard
>part was killing all those bears cats and wolves to sell their pelts to PC's
>for the money for HQ ore and carrying it from Highkeep, you don't always get
>xp for killing them... that would be why he is still lvl 13. I worked my
>butt off killing time consuming non xp bearing animals so I could sell the
>pelts for the plat for the ore for the armor and picked up all the other
>ingredients for it and the molds myself too. So if you are in your simple
>banded armor with a lousy weapon its 'cause you haven't been playing to make
>plat, you've been playing for xp alone.
>So sorry you guys in this group are all a bunch of sour faced jealous
>nitwits that have nothing better to do than trash someone who was already
>disappointed by the loss of months of hard work. You guys are really
>miserable assholes and before you get me pissed off over nothing but purile
>stupidity I'm going to unsubscribe.
>Go ahead. Keep posting your drivel. I won't be back to read it. I've been
>reading this group for a week now and haven't seen anything useful yet. All
>you do is bitch at and about each other. Games are supposed to be FUN.
>Goodbye and Good Riddance,

Psychotic gleam in eyes: 10/10
Foaming spittle: 10/10
