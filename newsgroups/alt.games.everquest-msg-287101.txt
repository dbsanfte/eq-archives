I've not played EQ for few years now (Since WoW came out) and I miss
the scary bits.

I remember adventuring, solo, into the underground dungeon in the
Field of Bones with my Enchanter.  The one where you can't get back
out again without using magic or fighting the whole way through.  That
was scary.

Same for the little multi-level dungeon that you could go to at about
level 8.  You needed to kill a mob to get a key to go to the next
level.  That was scary too.

The house of undead with the mini-maze in front of it.  There's
nothing as scary as any of this in the whole of wow that I have seen
(I'm at max level but don't raid).

Good times.

p.s. sorry, I've forgotten most of the names.
