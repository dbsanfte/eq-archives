Fallout UK had the children removed.

REALLY annoying, since one of the missions (in the tech city) required
you to find a wrench.  You had to give a doll to a kid, then the kid
would tell you where to find the wrench.

In the UK version, you had to trek all the way to the mutie city to
get one.  Bah !

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
