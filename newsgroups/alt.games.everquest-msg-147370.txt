That's what bothers me, not being sure I'm lucky.  I mean, my mom's a heck 
of a character, maybe she could have been the one who made them all go sit 
in the corner and not blow up any buildings today.  Sure, the odds are 
about a million to one, but hey, every once in a while the RNG works out 
for ya.

}Yeah, I guess it would matter then.

It would matter, sure, but then... I wouldn't be coming here and whingeing 
about lack of a banner on a website.  Nor would I have indulged myself in 
15-odd occurrences of the word 'fuck'.  Nor would I have called any 
Americans unamerican.  Personally, if my mom did die in such a way, I 
would think an American flag and repeated exclamations of 'we will never 
forget' would be a really pathetic way to remember her.  We each gotta do 
our own thing.  I'm sad for your loss, and I don't begrudge your mourning, 
but please.  I'd like to be in Verant's world now, not this one.

}All I'm saying is it wouldn't have hurt anyone to put a little
}something on the website. Hell, even Paypal had a small banner.

For that matter, so did Allakhazam's.  But it's unreasonable to expect 
everyone to have a banner, and even more unreasonable to think that lack 
of a banner is disrespectful and unamerican.
