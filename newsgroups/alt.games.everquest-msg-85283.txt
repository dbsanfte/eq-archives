Well, I would say that typical <foo> history courses teach the Standard 
Curriculum of Distorted History.  Growing up in a remote western state did 
offer the opportunity to take some more specific history courses.  I 
assumed that all states offered <state> history in 4th, 8th, and 11th 
grades.  I was very suprised to move to the east coast and find that most 
peole never had a state history course.  I guess the thinking is that 
those states are already represented well enough in the history books.  
(Or maybe that nobody really cares about the history of New Jersey.  Hey, 
put that chair down, ow ow ow ow!  I take it back Vito, ow ow ow!)
