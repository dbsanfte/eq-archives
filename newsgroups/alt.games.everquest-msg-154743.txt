Ah thanks, makes more sense (to me).

It's when you have the majority of the force present and another guild zones
in and beats you to it which I was mainly referring (so long as you don't
piss around too much of course). You're saying that's not FCFS thats just a
grief guild/jacking a raid. 2 guilds present building forces at bank
scenario I have no issue with. FCFS for sure.
