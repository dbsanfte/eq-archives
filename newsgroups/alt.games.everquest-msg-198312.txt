Actually, the thing that bugs me about this is that 1-25 are my second
favorite level range (fave so far being 40-50.. I'm only 55)
Though I guess my poor 'first character ever played' monk could certainly
use this...he's 24th, came up before Kunark so has no weapon skills, just
hand to hand, and lost all his gear in the great 'celebration of nekkidness'
(equipment wipe) a few years ago.
Too bad I'm likely to not be playing much more.
