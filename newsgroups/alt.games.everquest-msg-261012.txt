iirc...

Alchemy started at 0 (no skill), and would not improve (by 
tradeskilling) until you spent one training point in it. However, 
because it was a tradeskill, you couldn't spend 1 point becuase that 
would bring it to 25 which was against the rules for tradeskills (max 
20). So it was stuck at 0.

We told them you couldn't train it. They created a 50th level shaman, 
with ~50 skill, tried a few combines to see that it raised, and figured 
the entire shaman community for idiots, and simply ignored them for 
another 6 months.

Never once did they bother to actually test the problem: That it 
couldn't be trained in the first place

At least that's my 2nd hand recollection... I played an Enchanter and a 
Shadowknight preKunark.
