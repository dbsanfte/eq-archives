Yeah, heaven forbid that they actually have a useful screen that tells
people whether they can log in or not. ..  or <gasp> even useful
messages on the loggin server that lets you know whether it's
conjested from people trying to log in or just down. 

I just can't see where anyone could defend their current
implentantation of server/loggin status as arrogance that shows a
total lack of respect for the time of their customers.
