If they are idiots disband them and take the loss start over . If you can
figure it out before anyone enters the dungeon it dosent even cost you a
loss . Hell I even disbanded a guildmember that wasnt paying the proper
attention and we do dungeons in 45 mins usually.

I have had mixed sets of pickup groups . Good guild pickups have been
excellant , own guild groups have been for the most part good with 2 people
blacklisted now , random pickups for the most part have been good but bad
gear causes them to come far to close to the wire ie. dont take them if you
have another choice. Bad gear casters are better than bad gear tanks, my
monk is running 32 and 0 , my chanter only running 16 and 4 though , and my
druid is hopeless at 1 and 2.
