You're in the right spot fo plat, at your level.  In the Warrens, turn left
and go towards the Room with the King.  You should do ok in that area,
though the king is too high for you.  You should be able to pull in more
like 30pp per hour in the Warrens with all the bronze that drops.  They sell
for an average of 2pp each.  Also, do the molar quest.  That will get you
armor pieces, on occasion, which sell for 3-4 pp ea.  You can also go to the
Qeynos Catacombs and kill Qubert for the earring quest (just be very careful
in Qeynos until you have killed many, many gnolls).
