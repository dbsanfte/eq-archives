I solved the problem by telling ZA not to popup alerts.
Also I have found that if, once I've connected with ZA on, and I shut it
off, I have to re-boot for it to take effect again. Use this util to check
your ports: https://grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2
Do make sure you have a reasonably current version of ZA. I think I'm using
2.62 or something.
Oh-I use 98SE. You couldn't pay me to use XP. I saw a web page that had lots
of good info about how leaky and insecure XP is, but I can't find it right
now.
Anyway, my opinion: Anyone who doesn't have a hardware firewall, and has
internet access, NEEDS to have Zone Alarm running. It's the only "personal
firewall" program that blocks all ports not only from access, but from even
reporting that a computer is even connected to that IP. Any port probing
comes up empty-no response of any kind is returned.
