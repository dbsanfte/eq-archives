Velious graphics are not showing on the new models, even if you have
velious and have it enabled and saw them on your models before
installing luclin.

Its especially icky on the dyed velious leather such as from TOV
quests on wood elf druid girls. Their default new model leather outfit
shows lots of skin. Since the velious leather graphic is not showing,
we instead see that new regular leather graphic which shows lots of
skin with green dye over it. The problem is the skin is colored also.

I also noticed that banded or velious chain look the same on my vah
shir shaman.
