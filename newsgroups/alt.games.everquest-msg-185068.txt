Arguing to prove a point would involve something other than "Nuh-uh!" and 
some vaguely insulting conspiracy theory allusions. As for dick-waving and 
childish, regardless of whether you arguing to prove a point you seem to 
excel at both of these things.

I am not even sure you know what you're doing, period.

So would your statement.

No, it simply attempts to justify the statement.

...and round robin back to "wimpy attempt at an insult", from the one who 
just professed to be above such childish dick-waving.

Summary of this thread:

Empty: Hey, I suspect something is amiss.. I think I will experiment and 
look for proof they may be fucking people over to save on bandwidth 
charges.
Tyger: Nuh-uh! Sony loves me. You're a delusional paranoid.
(flame war ensues)

The only thing *close* to an argument you have made is that it would not be 
worth it for Sony to snip "a few pennies[1]" off their bill, and even that 
was done in such a roundabout way the poin was lost in the poison. 

If you want to keep acting like a grade-A fucktard, feel free. I certainly 
can't stop you. Just know that it will be met with a /ignore (or the xnews 
Perl regexp equivalent). If, on the other hand, you have some argument with 
merit to it, feel free to bring it up.
