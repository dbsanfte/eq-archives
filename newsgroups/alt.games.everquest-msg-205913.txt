I don't know about you, but if this particular enchanter had flagged for
the planes rather than got in recently with the lowered requirements, he
may have seen quite enough of the Plane of Storms to make playing there
a bit boring. While the zone looks nice, I didn't find it particularly
fun to play in at any of the camps I was at. The time I put in getting
myself and other guildmates keyed to BoT pretty well wore out any
interest I had in that zone for a while. Of course I feel the same way
about PoV too, spent quite enough time there thanks, won't group there
unless it's friends I want to hang out with.

Or, he's just loot focused and want's a BoT group for a chance at
a mini spawn.

Just got flagged for Sol Ro's tower. Hope it's not another raid only
zone as I could use a change of scene for a bit while we work on taking
down RZ. Otherwise I guess I'll be spending most of my time in deep
Veksar, at least it's fresh scenery.

3-4% per kill? Damn I want my elemental flags now.
