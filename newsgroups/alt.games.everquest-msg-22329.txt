Not exactly the same - there's poor pathing, such as you describe in
Mistmoore, and then there's *specific* pathing. Verant *clearly* set
up the pathing in Crushbone to use the bridges. The orcs are not
walking around on some bizarre path - they're taking a route around
the water.

Verant is certainly capable of having mobs go through water to reach a
PC - kite something along a rough shoreline sometime and you'll see it
happen constantly. This means that this isn't a technical (engine)
limitation.

Further, the player wasn't taking advantage of a place where the orc
*couldn't* reach him (which as I recall is what was actually happening
in the Conquest situation you mentioned as being the "same thing"). On
the contrary, the orc could easily reach him, it just had to use the
bridge to do so. 

>Inconsistancy is damn near a Verant trademark.

On that point, we're in full agreement.
