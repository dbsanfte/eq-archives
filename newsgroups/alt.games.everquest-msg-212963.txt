    The fix was for mobs that are level 55? and higher, and they simply
don't poof. As long as one point of attributable damage has been done to
such a mob, the corpse stays. That's what was behind the old "charm burn"
Western Wastes bug, where a lone bard could solo pretty much any mob in the
zone. I don't know that this was fixed for lower-level mobs.
