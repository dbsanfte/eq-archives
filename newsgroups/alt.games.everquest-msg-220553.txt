ok lenny will again try

When a anamal lives in the natural place on earth there is a set birth
rate offset by food and how many ways there are to get dead

rabbites, rats and mice are eaten by MANY other anamals so there are
LOTS of babies all the time to make up for the losses 
CASE IN POINT there were rabbites let loose in australa and notheing
to eat them. same with mice and rat in australa AND BECAME MADNESS 

Same with the cats... the # of kittens is based on the fact there are
anamals would eat kittens (or cats). but humans keep the kittens safe
so there is no offsetting death to make it worse cats can not HUNT as
that is not needed for a pet so is lost in most cats (not all). in the
end mate have kittens DIE not fast and allmost painless but from
starving sickness worms fleas...slow death. that can be stopped by
stopping it befor it starts

Dogs are worse as the huntting is gone. wild dogs may learn to kill
but the that do become a danger to human and most of the pets and farm
anamals that man keep..... but the have the same mating problems as
cats. for much the same reason

   sorry my spell checker died so this may even be harder to under
stand
