You completely misread my stance. I never said "it's always been good
enough" or that if the government mandates it its "okay". You
assumptions are too narrow, as is your view of history.

You ignore the facts. I will try to explain it one more time more
clearly....

30 years ago punch card voting systems were state of the art. They
were more accurate and tabulated elections faster than any other
system used up to that time. Many counties still counted by hand 30
years ago, and the margin of error and possiblities of election fraud
were much higher. Despite the flaws the punch card systems were
exponentially better than the manual systems they replaced. (The
astute reader will notice a pattern here.)

The technology simply did not exist to produce a better system. Punch
card systems have been "good enough" because there was nothing better
to replace them until the last 5-7 years.

Over the last 5-7 years newer systems have been introduced. To date
the most successful are the Optical Scan systems. These are "fill in
the bubble" type systems that are very similar to scan-tron tests used
in schools. While you don't have "hanging chads" voters still find
ways to screw things up. Such as circling the candidates names instead
of filling in the bubble, using check marks or "x"s that are not read
by the scanners, or making incomplete erasures when they make a
mistake. These types of mistakes result in over and under votes, that
produce errors similar to the problems seen with "hanging chads" in
punch card voting systems. A manual recount or recounting with the
optical scanners will produce different results (within the margin of
error) than the original count done on the day of the election.

The next generation of voting systems that are being deployed today
are Touch Screen Systems. These systems are more accurate than either
punch card and optical scan. They completely remove the possibility of
the voter "over-voting" (voting for 2 people in a "pick 1" race), but
they cannot prevent "under-votes" if the voter fails to make a
selection. Further these systems do not produce a hard copy (such as a
paper ballot) that can be used to prove voter intent. Recounts are
useless, because the Touch Screen machines will spit out the exact
same results from their memory cards and internal memory each and
every time. If a machine and/or memory card is lost, stolen, or
damaged beyond repair, the votes cannot be recovered. If the system is
hacked (which is nearly impossible due to many factors I won't go
into), the original votes could be altered or destroyed.

The estimated cost of implementing an Optical Scan or Touch screen
system is roughly 3.75-4 million dollars per 250,000 voters, and that
is on the low side. It is nearly impossible to justify that type of
investment based solely on the rare instances where close elections
highlight the flaws in punch card systems. Especially in the tough
economic times that started prior to November 2000 and continue to
this day.

In response to Nov2000 the feds and many states (such as California)
are providing funding to aid counties in replacing their punch card
systems. The voters themselves have demanded the change (Prop 41
passed in CA to enable this funding), and are willing to pay the tax
dollars required to make it happen. This simply would not have
happened without the events of Nov2000 changing peoples perceptions.

The Earth remained flat until the technology existed (such as ships
that could circumnavigate the globe, etc) to prove conclusively that
it wasn't. 

People felt the same way you do about hand counting when punch card
systems were state of the art. I am sure there will be people who feel
the same way you do about Optical Scan and Touch Screen systems when
better technologies exist in the future. They will bitch and moan
about the inherint flaws in these systems and they will point to newer
technologies and methods making the ignorant assumption that these
technologies existed all along just like you are doing today.
