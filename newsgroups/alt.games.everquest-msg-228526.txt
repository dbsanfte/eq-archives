    We do it when no "real loot" mobs are up. The way our background points
system handles it is simple: LDoN points are held separate from raid points.
So you attend LDoN raids to earn credit towards LDoN drops, no interweaving
of the two systems. That way people who don't give a crap about LDoN don't
feel threatened if they miss stuff or are excluded due to numbers.

    1 or 2, forget which. A pile of people zoned in right afterwards and
finished the job. It was the definition of zerg - one BST came back twice to
cast one nuke and die, as people with low DPS died they dropped from the
raid and the people who couldn't get in due to the 72 man limit added in,
and Quarm ended up dying from an unattributed DoT (Quarm dies). Disappointed
the people going for the killshot, but I laughed - it's like he just gave up
under the weight of the corpses. ;-)

    Last night we had a disappointing wipe at 16%. When people don't get
cures even after they're told how important it is, well, what do you do?

    He has two damage tables. Something to do with minimizing the chances of
a Riposte being a deciding factor in a fight.
