Actually...  I went to Stromm the day after it opened...  Apparently I'm not a
good player as my Mage is only lvl 13 at this point, but she does have all her
Newbie armor and her weapon as well as the Sarnak Blood quest mask... hehe...

Anyway, there is a guild on Stromm that popped up almost immediately called
<Cypher>.  They had at LEAST one lvl 50 player by the end of the first week of
the server going live.  Most of the others were well into their 30's and 40's
while I was still running around killing rats for their tails... LOL

To me that is insane...  I do like daylight now and again personally.
