His spawn points aren't in areas where you'd camp, although they
are near certain camps and he does path to them.  Eventually he
ends up at KFC, for instance, if he lives long enough.  But he
usually paths close enough for people camping the spires to gank
him fairly quickly.

Quillmane looks exactly like a pegasus, of course.  He's one of
those rare mobs that you KNOW exactly what to expect and you're
stunned they did such a great job of rendering him.  And, IMO,
they really did - it's such a beautiful sight you *almost* hate
to kill it.  *Almost.* ;)
