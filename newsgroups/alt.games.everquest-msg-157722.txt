It was a "beta test" spell that didn't make the final cut.
Caster's Realm is showing outdated info, and I'm getting
annoyed at constant shouts in the Library asking where
it can be found.  Some people get downright stubborn
when I try to explain there ain't no such spell.

It would have been silly for the spell to have gone live
anyway, it would have made Instrument of Nife redundant,
and would have made the level 49 Divine Might quest spell
pointless.
