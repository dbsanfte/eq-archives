My auction pet peeve is those that add PST to their auctions. Hello? If I
want it, I'll send you a tell. Otherwise, you're just adding jargon that
confuses me even further.

My usual response to these people is, "So what's the price in other time
zones?"

Minor, I admit. But it still bugs me. For all I can tell, they're auctioning
a polished stone tomahawk in addition to whatever it is they want to sell,
instead of using a cheezy shorthand for "plz send tells".
