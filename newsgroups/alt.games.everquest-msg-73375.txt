Heh, the Navy's idea of PT has always been a bit skewed.  Half of my
division is on mando PT for failing the run.  What do the mando PT leaders
have them do?  Jumping jacks and push ups!  Great, they'll max out the push
ups and sit ups yet again and fail the run yet again.  Ah well, more proof
that common sense isn't all that common.

Ah, divorce blues.  Amazing thing is, I actually know some people who are
still with their first wife.  Sad that that has to be the exception.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
