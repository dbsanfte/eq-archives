Best suggestion I've heard yet. And it could be rounded off easily and
in keeping with the "roleplaying" part of the discussion. You become a
"Master" of any skill when you hit 100, yes? Well, once you've
"mastered" meditation, it would be logical to assume that you might be
able to do it without the book. When do you hit 100 skill?
/em takes off shoes and socks to count quickly
Level 19. So after you hit 19, you sit down with your book open and med
until you max your skill to 100 and *poof*! You no longer need the book.
If you have to shorten the curve, that's certainly one approach that
would have been easier to swallow.

Somebody on (I think) Zeb post here a while back that they had
petitioned to get their corpse off Hate and the request was granted. But
I think that was because they had died either due to servers going down
for an unscheduled patch, zone crashing, or maybe VERY long LD during a
raid and got left behind.
