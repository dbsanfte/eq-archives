You could _probably_ do doze with the group listed.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17120 is droppable, though
may be a bit tough to obtain in the first place.  Probably "excessive" if
you would be buying it :P
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17420 should definitely be
doable, and is a decent upgrade for your neck, though the stats are a little
less than ideal.
Clattering Bone Necklace should be available for a few k in bazaar.

Take your monk to PoV and get the stuff (metallic liquid, razorfiend talon,
brick of valorium) yourself.  Your chanter bot can handle the imbue for you,
so all you're looking at are "donations" to get the metal enchanted
(smithing combine, not incredibly difficult) and the JC combine (hell, spend
a few k and a few AA points and do it and all your future jewelry yourself).

So I hear.  Not a whole lot out there that's better for wrist slots and
isn't insanely expensive or insanely hard to get (dropping deep in ssra, VT
or ToV) though.  You mentioned you were already planning on doing BoB.

Running 30k on Karana, count your blessings :P

Over 50% more AC (45 base, 8 more AGI), more HP (50 HP base, 8 more STA), 5
to all saves, 5 more dex, at the cost of 4 less STR and 15kpp more.  Worth
it IMO.  If you want to cut your costs, the only drops it requires are 2
vials of blood from CT.  After that it's a single brewing combine and a
single non-cultural smithing combine.  From what i hear, the blood is
somewhat common.  I'm _sure_ you can gather components for this and cut your
cost probably by over 50%.

SBC would be a nice upgrade (adds 9 str and 9 sta at cost of 1ac).
Cloak of the Maelstrom adds STR, HP, DEX and STA at the cost of some AC.
Hiero Cloak is always nice ;)

Go for a nightmarewood bow.  Starts proc'ing around lvl 50 from what i hear,
and has decent stats once you get into your 50s (better stats than BFT at
lvl 52).  Probably around 5k in bazzar (at least that's what most the
servers are at).  Have the ranger make you a bag full of long range arrows.
Other PoP player-crafted bows are nicer, but go up in price exponentially.
You might also want to look into PoP pottery items.  Some of 'em have some
really nice stats.

NFI, i was being a smartass ;)

My own rogue twink is slowing down, since i'm concerned about keeping his
skills up with his lvl.  Taking about 2 hours per lvl at 28, but that's with
a fuckwit group in highkeep.  (Twinkie and a_rand_meat_shield01 are duoing
WR just fine with the help of Twinkie's big sister druid.  suddenly,
a_rand_meat_shield01 shouts, 'WR LMF, come on!'  /sigh.)

haven't really looked into any of the masks or anything yet.
