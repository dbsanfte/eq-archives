Honestly, the term just seems out of place to me. It appears to be merely 
a less correct alternative, and I don't see any logical reason for using 
it. 

Why do some people refer to their...
...car as their "ride"?
...place of residence as their "crib"?
...shoes as "kicks"?
...jewelry as "bling bling"?

I believe that most (naturally there are exceptions) people who use the 
term "toon" in reference to a MMORPG character do so merely because they 
find the correct term to be less interesting. I also believe that the 
desire to be more interesting is one very accurate way of describing what 
it means to try and be more "hip" or "trendy".

I have a problem when people feel the uncontrollable need to change 
things simply for the sake of change.
