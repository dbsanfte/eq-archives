    The total destruction of something enchanters have done since Beta, and
you can't believe they're surprised? The new changes make charm undesirable
as crowd control, for soloing, as added DPS in a raid or group, in any
situation you'd think of using it. Something that was considered
class-defining enough to merit multiple AA abilities and multiple post-60
spells is now useless.

    Guess what? So do my full groups in Tactics pit. Guess we better nerf
them, too.

    If the problem is the boss drops, make changes in the boss areas. Doing
something like, for example, flagging the mobs in the immediate area of the
boss high MR would stop solo enchanters from getting anything. They would at
least have to partner with someone else capable of keeping a pet from the
low MR areas alive until you got to the boss.

    Any monk, rogue, necromancer, or bard could already train the living
daylights out of a group. Last I heard, Feign and Escape weren't under
consideration for nerfing. In fact, on Test they were testing a 100% success
mem blur Feign for monks.

    Which is too bad, as SOE also balanced several raid encounters in PoP
with charm in mind. Places where adds cannot be mezzed, nor can they be
effectively offtanked without an army of support, but they can be charmed.
Guess the next generation of up-and-coming guilds can just suck it up and
try to get past those encounters with brute force.
