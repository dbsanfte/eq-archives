Ensnaring a mob keeps it in place once agro is cleared.

I had to turn in some heads to captain bvellos the other day.. and for some
reason he just took off, going for a guided tour of the arena.  I assisted
him, but no agro on anybody.. wtf?!

So i agro him, run him back to the bank (fd a zillion times to clear his
agro, cuz he wasn't going home;which resets agro) and he starts going back
up into the arena (you could still hand in heads, but im kos to some arena
stuff, so it was a problem for me)

In the end i ran him to the bank, meleed him till i proc'd ensnare, and quit
out to clear my agro.  Come back in, and there he is, still in the same spot
Id left him at :)
