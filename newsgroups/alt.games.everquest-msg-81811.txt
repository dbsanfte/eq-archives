Well this is just my opinion from my experience so take it as you will,
   My main toon is a 44 erudite necro, and I would like to list a few things
that I have noticed in my necro's advancement.
 First and foremost of course we all know that the erudite starts with the
highest int for the necro class, that being said the main advantage of this
(in my opinion) would be that it makes it a simple task to hit the 200 int
mark.  Keeping this in mind it seems easier to have items with other stats
other then int that you may or may not need depending on your playing style.
For me I use a few plus str items (to carry loot) and quite a few plus
hp/mana items in slots where alot of other races are still using these slots
for int items. I hunt alot with a dark elf necro friend and also a human
necro buddy and from comparing gear I seem to have the most versitility in
gear simply because it takes less effort to max out int.
