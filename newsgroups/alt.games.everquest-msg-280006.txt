	(1990 + (1990 * (.25 + .28 + .05))) * 2 = 6288.4.

	I still think that's practically a cheal.  Even at a 
"base" 3144 it's enough to take the tank from 5% to 30%, or a caster
to almost full health.  And don't forget that mana preservation foci 
work on PR, making the mana cost closer to 420.

	The big win here is the cast time.  I find myself chaining
this in emergencies, and the extra 40 mana doesn't matter so much right
then.  Cheal's great if you *have* 10 seconds :-)
