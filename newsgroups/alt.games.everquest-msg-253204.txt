DELUXE ENCHANTER PETS

While it is asserted by some that Magicians are masters of the
summoned pet I am here to dispute such rubbish. It should be obvious
to anyone that Enchanters have the best pets. "Scoff, scoff" you say?
You think our animations are puny, stupid and lack the scintillating
conversation offered by other casters� pets? If I were speaking of the
default Enchanter pet line, the (insert lame anagram-created name
here)'s Animation, you would be correct. However, we have a deluxe
line of enchanter pets that people seem to forget about, each with
their own strengths and weaknesses. One immediate advantage you'll
note is that we can have up to five pets at a time. Let us examine
each in turn:

Warrior
Components Needed: Celerity and an alcoholic beverage or promise of
lots of shiny metal objects.
Pros: Strong attack/defense, it will usually last long enough for you
to zone or gate to safety.
Cons: A tendency to get you trained by mobs, Auto-Attack always seems
to be on, "/Pet Back Off" command appears to be bugged.
The toughest of our pet line but often the most troublesome. The
warrior pet comes in many shapes and sizes. I prefer the barbarian
warrior pet combo. With a warrior pet it�s generally best to just turn
them loose and stand back. They ignore most commands and tend to pull
when you're least ready. Hearty, strong, and stupid (but within
acceptable limits), the warrior is best used in dungeons and other
tight fighting spots. Make sure you stand upwind of it though.

Ranger
Components Needed: Clarity and words of encouragement, or free rezzes.
Pros: Nice multipurpose pet; can track, forage, and cast spells, some
fighting ability.
Cons: Tends to die a lot, poor self image.
Great for outdoor hunting if you can't manage to summon a druid pet.
The ranger pet is good for quests. It is excellent at locating that
rare spawn. Like following a bloodhound without any depth perception
you'll go careening all over the zone, often passing much more
interesting spawns, but eventually you will run your quarry to
ground...unless it de-spawns in the meantime.

Paladin
Components Needed: Clarity and tell it you're on a mission from the
gods.
Pros: Decent fighting ability, great one shot heal, very
self-sacrificial.
Cons: Holier than thou.
The paladin is great for those areas where you need to burn a pet to
achieve your ends, such as holding off a group of berserk undead while
you loot that special spawn and gate to safety. Also useful for
purchasing things and turning in quest items in those good cities
where you've "accidently" killed one too many
sacred fish or annoying halflings.

Shadowknight
Components Needed: Clarity and save it from villagers with pitchforks
and torches.
Pro: Decent fighting ability, nasty one shot DD, can summon its own
pet, few if any ethical hangups.
Cons: Will sell you out to villagers with pitchforks and torches, few
if any ethical hangups.
The shadowknight pet is the very definition of a double-edged sword.
Handy in a fight and utterly ruthless, it may trip you up trying to
elbow its way out the door to the zone exit. Their best use is for
activities too repulsive for paladins but too tough for rangers. Never
turn your back on it.

Bards
Components Needed: An audience.
Pros: Mana song make Enchanters feel like they have Clarity.
Cons: It's a bard.
The bard pet is mostly useful for enhancing other pets. Otherwise they
run too fast, tend to aggro everything in hearing range and clutter up
your text buffer.

Rogues
Components Needed: It will choose it own components.
Pros: Able to enter wretched hives of scum and villainy (Felwithe,
Rivervale, etc.).
Cons: Have an aggressive form of "/autosplit others".
The Rogue pet is your ultimate stealth pet. When you need to get into
and out of hostile territory without having your pet aggro everything
in sight, summon a rogue. They seldom cause trains and gods save any
mob that turns its back on a rogue pet to smash your beautiful face.
It is generally unwise to accept food or drink from rogue pets.

Necromancers
Components Needed: Phat l00t.
Pros: Just ask, they'll tell you about them for hours.
Cons: Talk in an arcane argot called d00dspeak (and you thought gnoll
was bad).
One of the most powerful pets available to you but also the hardest to
summon. The necromancer pet is virtually self-sufficient to the point
of not even needing you. Use this pet to kill other people's pets,
break spawns or make you feel really inadequate. They may challenge
you to a duel, sometimes even during a pull.

Wizards
Components Needed: Clarity and flammable targets.
Pros: Your own personal nuclear arsenal.
Cons: Fragile, they make rangers seem robust.
If you like quick brutal fights with long down times then the wizard
pet is for you. Best for eliminating that singular uber-mob in a loud,
colorful fashion, the wizard pet is a self driven auto-cannon with
fire-and-forget capability. They are death machines right up until a
mob actually gets close enough to lay hands/claws/fangs upon it or
they go "oom". Then wizards tend to die. Fast. They also make
great taxis.

Magicians
Components Needed: Clarity and patience.
Pros: Wal-Mart in a robe.
Cons: Slow recast time after link death.
While the magician pet can summon additional "lesser" pets and deal
out direct damage spells, perhaps its best use is as your own private
supply wagon. Need food and drink? The mage summons it. Need more
bandages? Tap the mage. Magic weapons for newbie pets? You know who.
It is best if you allow your magician pet to summon an elemental pet
as this will extend its lifespan by an order of magnitude. Besides the
mob will then have to chew through two pets to get to you.

Druid
Components Needed: Clarity and a donation to Green Peace.
Pros: As ranger without actually being a ranger.
Cons: Fleas.
The druid pet is "the" outdoors specialist. Curiously, a druid pet
fights best while running away which is a tactic that takes a little
getting use to. Not recommended for Enchanters with heart or lung
problems. The druid is marvelously self-sufficient but not as
annoyingly so as the necromancer. They are also great for travel. Need
to get to some godsforsaken spot on Norrath? There is probably a druid
ring within a zone or two of it. A word of caution, if you enjoy
killing bears, wolves, and treants then letting a druid transport you
can turn into a one-way trip.

Shaman
Components Needed: Clarity and a donation to the "magical herb fund".
Pros: They're not bards.
Cons: Always pawing through something's entrails trying to divine
lotto numbers.
The shaman pet is the pet you summon to enhance other pets. A shaman
excels at making your other pets stronger, faster and tougher. It can
also cast some offensive spells and even fight if pressed. And it does
it without being a bard. It also can create potions that duplicate the
more useful spells or just see and hear cool colors. Be watchful of
their pets as they may try to bury your wand or rod in the backyard.

Cleric
Components Needed: Clarity and a donation to the local temple.
Pros: Your own personal M*A*S*H.
Cons: Chance of a jihad.
The cleric pet is another great support pet. It has incredible healing
abilities and can generally cure all that ails you. A good choice when
you're going after undead or attacking a leper colony. When summoning
a cleric pet one should be mindful of which god the cleric pet
represents as this can make the difference between receiving the
blessings of a higher power or eternal damnation or both.

Monk
Components Need: Celerity and seven divine truths.
Pros: Low maintenance, self repairing.
Cons: Has a tendency to faint during bad pulls.
The monk pet is ideal for Enchanters who travel light. One seldom has
to equip a monk pet and it will actually complain if you give it too
much coin. For the quick, surgical strike summon a monk pet. The monk
is also extremely handy if you need wooden boards or bricks cut in
two.
