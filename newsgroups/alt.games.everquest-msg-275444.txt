Maybe its just me, but I don't understand what the point of the whole room 
thing is.  I've never bought one stick of furniture.  I've sold every piece 
of furniture I received from questing.  I've never been in anyone else's 
room, I've never had anyone come into mine.  With money as tight as it is 
for me right now, I can't see spending coin on something that no one will 
ever see or care about if they do happen to wander in when I'm selling off 
my bulletin board.

On a different topic...
I think SOE should make it so that you can have the items in your house 
vault available for sale while you're out adventuring.  The reason I don't 
sell a lot of my stuff on the boards is because if I'm on-line I want to be 
doing something instead of just sitting there in my room.  I think there 
would be a lot more stuff on the boards by letting players go off and do 
something else while they were selling.
