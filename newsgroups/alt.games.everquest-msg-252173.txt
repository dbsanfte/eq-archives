UPDATE: Death By Standing

So there I am running along in a Takish LDoN.  Puller is a cleric, using 
pacification, but several times now she's pulled half a room because she 
can't see around corners to tell if there's a mob or three she isn't 
able to see.

Well, I can see around corners easy, and have done so a lot with a 
couple friends (warrior/cleric pair I ran LDoN's with more than I've 
ever grouped with anyone on any character).  I usually don't bother with 
groups that aren't used to me because most people aren't good at getting 
scouting info from a mage.

But here's a time when its looking necessary, so I start popping out 
eyes and checking doorways at least for the cleric, trying to sell her 
on the idea that if I can have a couple seconds I can save us a lot of 
overpulls.

Then it happens.  I click up the eye, sit down, perspective shifts, I 
run the eye up to the door, go in, and everything in the room aggros and 
mass murders me the hard way (many killers, one victim)... and I can't 
even see whats happenening because I'm looking down at my group back in 
the other room!

Worked out what happened afterwards: For some reason the eye took a bit 
longer than usual to shift perspective, and what I thought was a shift 
was due to me sitting down while on some odd projection in the floor. 
So when I hit the up arrow to move the eye forward, I actually stood 
character's real body up, ran forward and into the room.  A second or 
two later, as they started to eat me alive, my perspective finally 
shifted to the eye, I died, so my viewpoint locked into an overhead 
view, not of my body as usual, but of where the eye used to be!

If this little lag had happened before, I'd have just sat tight, unable 
to move till I stood.  In fact, I've used that as a safety measure, both 
to prevent this happening and to prevent moving accidentally when the 
eye expires.

Guess I'll have to try and look up how to stop it happening, I can't 
think of any time when this is actually going to be handy for me, and 
its very annoying to have it killing me!
