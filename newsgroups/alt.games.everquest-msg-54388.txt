I received an e-mail  from sony today telling about all sorts of
undead and monster fun occurring today for Halloween. Let's hope this
begins when the server comes up and not just for those who play
between 5pm-11pm pst.

Some of us work nights, others aren't in the country.

Minus the HTML graphics here what it said.

The time is nigh for ghosts, werewolves, witches and more to once
again roam freely through the lands of Norrath. Join your fellow
adventurers during the Day of the Dead (October 31st) and see what is
in store for those brave enough to log on. Do you dare board the ghost
ship Deep Tomb for a most perilous ride through the ages? Will you
fight back the rising plague of lycanthropy as were-creatures take
control of the night? Or simply enjoy the spirit of the ghostly season
and partake in a romp of trick-or-treating? Regardless, know ye that
the lands of EverQuest will be most perilous, and you shall be taking
your life in your hands and must face the consequences if you seek out
fame and fortune during this day.
  
 
The rumors are spreading. What do they portend? Why have the clerics
of Mithaniel Marr cloistered themselves in deep commune with their
deity? What power do the Lanys cultists actually hold over the undead?
Do the Gypsies truly believe that the increase in supernatural
energies mark the return of the Combine? Is a cult of "Snake"
worshipers really starting to take food in Norrath? Is it true that
the veil that separates Norrath from the planes is weakening? When
will The Prophet once again return to the lands of Norrath to bring
with him times of great evil and decay? All these rumors and more will
be made clear in the coming days. Sharpen your blade. Memorize your
spells. You have been summoned to adventure.

 

As the great wizard Al`Kabor continues his research of lost magic of
the Combine Empire and the moon of Luclin glides across the skies, the
world of Norrath enters a turbulent period in its history. In the
coming weeks, join your fellow adventurers as untold challenges and
events arise to test even the heartiest of souls. During this Time of
Turmoil, experience dozens of GM and Guide hosted quests and events to
discover new secrets and unique treasures, promising to elevate the
honor and fame of your EverQuest character.
