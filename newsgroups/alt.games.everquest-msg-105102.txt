Surely they won't stop old world revamping there. 

Which newbie zone in the old world is now most due an upgrade?

Toxx: Very very empty
Gfay: Also very empty other than orc hill, but its auction zone
situation on some servers might be a consideration
Innothule: Is there anything here at all?
West Karana: they like to change this zone for events all the time
