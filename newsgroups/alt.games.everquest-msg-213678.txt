In case you missed it

All I can say is fight a necro and see if you still hold that opinion. The
darkness overwrites your movement spells so you crawl and start dying.

Have a necro stack this and another couple of dots, fear you, then send his
pet in. The darkness *is* the most annoying/effective spell since w/o it you
can run off and heal vs. take a beating. If the darkness doesn't stick,
everything else a necro throws at you is laughable.

Of course that assumes you don't get the first shot in, rooting his pet or
something along those lines.

I've pretty much always used a lot of charming so I use up my spell slots.
Maybe not deliberately but I have used it when I don't feel like waiting
around for a DOT and don't have room for DD.
