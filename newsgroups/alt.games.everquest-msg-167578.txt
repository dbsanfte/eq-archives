    Yes.

    He doesn't always hit for max. So as long as one person sees that he
quads, and another sees that his max hit is 3500, you know he quads for
3500. I actually survived one round of attacks because he didn't hit me for
3500 on any of them. It was more like 1900, miss, 1200, 800. I, um, didn't
make it past the second round of attacks. =/
