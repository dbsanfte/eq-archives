I use Adsubtract Pro, same as Demi. I even paid for it. It blocks the
windows before they open. I can probably count on one hand how many
pop up windows I've seen since I got it almost a year ago. Works
great. 

As for your crusade against IE *yawn*

I have IE because Netscape had a recurring problem that I couldn't get
rid of. I tried everything short of formatting the drive, including
totally removing Netscape, all its registry entries, and every file
with the word anywhere in it. Then I reinstalled. Then the problem
came back. Then I said screw it and installed IE. No problem since.
When blocking out IE, you're only hurting your site. Most people
aren't going to download a 35 meg tarball with their 56K modems that
you have to unzip and install yourself. Like it or not, IE is the
common denominator. It's the easiest to use and install, and that's
why it will continue to be the common denominator. Also, many people
don't have any choice about what browser they have. My last job used
IE, and if you didn't use IE, you didn't surf the web at work. My
current job is just the opposite. It's Netscape or nuthin'. I'd rather
surf than not surf. If you're really all that determined, make
different pages for IE and Netscape and have people click on which
browser they use to enter the site.
