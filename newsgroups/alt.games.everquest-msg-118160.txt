Actually - I would change that to "Intelligent people do not  get caught
breaking a EULA".

Anyone who has actually read *any* software EULA realises they are complete
and utter bullshit. The conditions and stipulations common in any software
EULA in the last 10 years have steadily eroded any moral obligations a end
user may have once entertained.

Basically they all can be condensed into the following:

"If it doesn't work - stiff shit. If it breaks your computer - stiff shit.
If it becomes sentinent, escapes your computer, burns your house down,
soddomises your mother and rapes your couch - stiff shit. If you have any
objections to this - stiff shit. If you feel that your money buys you any
rights - stiff shit. Once we have your money - please be a nice little
consumer and fuck off and die ummkay?"

I doubt even the most rabid EULA quoter's in the NG couldn't actually give a
shit about the actual EULA's either - they only care about their own little
pet sections of it and more importantly - how it can be used to force there
own agendas on others.

Why do people hate ebayers? Well - they may get *them* killed. Someone else
has brought something *they* had to work for. It is just annoys the shitter
out of *them* for some reason (rightly or wrongly). It is nothing as highly
principled as "hey - these people are breaking a morally binding agreement,
that's not right".

I personally think that in any argument a sound "hey - that's not very nice,
would you like that to be done to you?" has far times the weight than any
chapter and verse EULA quoting. Anyone who has to resort to EULA'ing over
the much simpler "stop being an ass" I suspect is doing so because their own
moral foundations are quite weak.
