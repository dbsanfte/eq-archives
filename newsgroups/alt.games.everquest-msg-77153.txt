Hi everyone, I'm a level 13 dark elf wizard.  I think because of all the
orcs I killed, I can now go into freeport and not get killed.  Everyone
looks at me dubiously and some shop keepers outside of town will sell to me.
So here is my question.  First off I have all add on packs including SOL.  I
do plan on travling all over seeing everything I can so what towns should I
watch out for and what can I kill/do to get them on my good side?

Thanks,
Noah
