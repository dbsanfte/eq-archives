Little old lady implies someone who is short on money and pretty 
defenseless, so taking money from a little old lady is deemed a 
dishonourable deed in the eyes of most.

The purse under the seat implies our poor defenseless little old lady 
left it there accidentally, thus not knowing about it and thus not 
mentioning it. Taking the purse is again deemed a dishonourable deed by 
most with a conscience.

I don't think your comparison is fair.

I think a better comparison would be a rich businessman who decides to 
shovel cash from business number 1 to business number 2 by having 
someone from business number 1 stash it behind a tree in a public park, 
where he intends to have someone from business number 2 pick it up later 
on. Before person from business number 2 can get there, Joe Bloggs finds 
it sitting there while he is eating his lunch. Joe looks around and sees 
person from business number 1 running away, and knowing what person 
number 1 was up to, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation and 
keep the money.

Sure Joe might be dishonest in doing so, since he knows who the money 
belongs to and why its there, but then again our businessman is taking 
stupid risks leaving cash there like that, and if Joe didn't find it 
someone else may have anyway.
