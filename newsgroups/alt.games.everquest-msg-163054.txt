	That doesn't mean they're correct to do so.  Lots of Rangers will jump at
any chance to use their bows, whether or not doing so means taking a (possibly
substantial) hit to their DPS.  Yesterday in Sky, we had a low 50s Ranger use
Archery the whole time we were up there.

	Which is not that good by today's standards.  As I said before, it's
easier for a Ranger to get a bow that will perform well at Hunter level than
it is to get melee weapons that will give the same performance.
