1) You're losing your kick, which does more damage than bash. (despite being
less effective)

2) You're possibly losing weapon attack.  No matter how fast you switch,
theres always the chance that you'll be in the middle when your 2 second timer
expires.

Theres no possible way you could be doing *more* damage.

I'm quite aware of the uses for it.

I do well enough taunting as is, with two quick moderately high damage weapons
with nasty procs.  I agree with you that in some situations it can be helpful,
but IMNAAHO, it's not worth aggrivating my (mild for the moment) CTS any more
than I have to.  Same reason I gave up on my bard, really.
