What server are you on, for starters?

Your best bet may be to make a dark elf, ogre, troll, or iksar mule, run 
them there, camp them, log the cleric, consent the mule, then go searching 
as a dark race under the dock. When you find it, drag the corpse to the 
east end of the outpost on the shore, where the  big wall is.

This, incidentally, ios a safe spot to med, bind, or do other things.

HTH!
