I'd appreciate it if some of you EQ Buffs could define a few terms for me 
when if comes to grouping and raiding.

Main Assist - I am under the imprssion that this is The Man ( or woman ) 
who starts tanking the big mobs and gains aggro before the rest of the 
force starts hacking away.

Secondary Assist - Like the main, but this "guy" jumps in his place when 
the MA dies.  Like the MA, he needs to be able to get aggro built up.

Assist Healing - target the mob, hit assist, and that's the person getting 
whacked, so that's the one that gets healed.

Any more?  Are the above correct?  I'm about to write some small posts for 
our guild site on grouping and want to make sure I use correct terms.
