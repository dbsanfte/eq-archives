I feel the same with my lvl 7 wiz, mana goes in a flash, but medding
brings it back rather quick.

Grouping can be revarding as long as the guy/girl pulling is making
shure that everyone is ready, i was in a group with as i think a druid
pulling, using lull or something, he almost always succeeded in
bringing one orc, at another time in N ro the puller managed to get
all 3 derves at us at once (we where 4) and one of them was a thug
and they hit hard, my necro was killed and i left that group right
away, teh problem at that time was neither of us was ready and
certainly not for all three.

I myself like to solo but i'm glad to help out when needed or group
for shorter periods.

/Regards Berth aka to many to mention :)
