This, in this one paragraph, shows exactly why Kerry lost the
election...and it wasn't because of gay marriage.

It was because of the inherent question that lies under a
gay-marriage debate, and the fact that those on the losing
side cannot even vaguely comprehend that somebody would
even remotely in some small way minutely have a different
opinion than they do without being locked up in an asylum.
One based upon, gasp, morality.

I can how Rosie O'Donnel's kids could grow up with a different
view of homosexuality than I have.  I can understand how a
young girl could be afraid to admit to her parents that she's
knocked up, and would get an abortion on the sly, growing up
into a woman paranoid about what nature would do to HER OWN
body whether she wants it or not!  I can completely comprehend
how a person whose favorite hiking trail was cut apart by
loggers and could be forced to spike some trees and kill the
$9/hr guys with the saws.

But what's funny, is they won't even try to understand me,
or people that think like I do. It's not just that they
wouldn't even attempt to listen, it's that upon learning
that I'm a southern Baptist, immediately file anything I
could say or do a "Fundie crap" and move on in their own
intellectually superior circles to chortle at the little
people in the backwards red states.

You know, the little people that win elections.
