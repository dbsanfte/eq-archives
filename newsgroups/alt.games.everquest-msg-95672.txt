OK, point taken.  I didn't realize that levels were as important to pets.  
I guess I'm letting my 55+ bias get in the way, where any of the pets seem 
to do decent damage, especially buffed and muzzled.

What does melee pounding on the mob have to do with landing root?  As far 
as I know, melee doesn't break root, nukes do.  As for the effects of 
root, maybe if you always fight in spots with enough room to move you 
don't have to worry about it, but if you're dungeon crawling with a couple 
fatties, sometimes there is no choice but to all gather around the mob.

Oddly enough the one time a mage spun up an earth pet in Velks, I asked if 
they couldn't use another pet, and EVERYONE aggreed.  We were fighting 
mainly spiders, but pulling gargs when they popped and the pet was really 
a problem then.  The only other mage I've seen in Velks with an earth pet 
was easily the worst mage I've ever seen.  His pet broke mez, he didn't 
know how to assist, he didn't damage shield the tanks, and then he would 
go AFK with his pet going crazy.  Maybe I just have a bad impression of 
earth pets from him, but I don't think I'm alone in thinking that earth 
pets should be used very sparingly in groups.

Nice if you have the room, in some dungeons, especially working your way 
in, it doesn't work like that.  What about CHeal mobs where you need to 
stun them at 50%?  I know my stun (every 4 seconds, low resists) moves the 
mob towards me slightly.  This isn't a problem if the mob isn't rooted, 
but when it is, the tanks all have to move every couple seconds or deal 
with a CHealing mob.  I'm not saying that there is no use for an earth pet 
in a group, I'm saying that 90% of the time, your groupmates would MUCH 
rather you used another pet with less damage that doesn't use root.  Name 
a single exp zone where PCs normally cast root on the active mob.  I can't 
think of any, though I'm sure they exist.  Every pet has a use, I just 
don't think that the earth pet is a good choice in a group (pet-caster 
groups are the obvious exception).
