Ok, some perspective really needs to be gained in this thread.  

The root of the issue: Why more high level content and not more low-mid 
level content?

The answer, while perhaps not as savory as one would hope, is simply that 
there is enough low-mid level content, and the high-level real-estate is 
always shrinking. 

People move through their twenties.  They are there for a while, they 
play, they out level it, more people enter their twenties.  There is no 
buildup.

When people get to Level 60, that's it.  They stay there, and it's built 
up very quickly if you haven't noticed.  

If you are not level 60, and you want new zones, what do you do?  Level 
and go to new zones.  Everything above your level should be viewed as "new 
content."  

You HAVE a lot left to see and do.  The level 60's who have been level 60 
for a year and a half don't.  That's why the high level content is needed 
so much more than new low level content.
