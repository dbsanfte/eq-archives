At least on my server, it is common practice that a wiped group still holds
claim to a camp.  Only a group of jerks would take it.  Unfortunately there
are alota jerks.

Who here has not seen "CAMP CHECK!"...  "Such&such not taken?"... "they
wiped & are otw back"
This would mean to me, & all the people I play EQ with (alota people) that
the camp is TAKEN.
