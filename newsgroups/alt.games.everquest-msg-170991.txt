I would have sworn that spell books used to have 50 pages but they got
changed to 35 about a year ago without any warning. I've always missed the
extra pages....I don't think I'm crazy. I used to keep my buffs on the last
page of my spellbook and used a macro /book 50 to jump right to them when
buff time came around. I just never complained because when they changed it
to 35 pages my /book 50 macro still worked it just takes me to page 35 vs
50.
I dunno maybe I drink too much while playing.
