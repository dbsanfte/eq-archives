    Wait no more. From Brad McQuaid:

"On June 4th, 2001, SOE banned and/or suspended 28 players belonging to the
guild Conquest. Plainly put, they were cheating, we observed them cheating,
they knew they were cheating, they admitted they were cheating, and they got
caught.

While SOE does not want to spoil the game by releasing full details of the
cheats to all players, basically the 28 Conquest players were (among other
things) purposely using world geometry, aspects of the hate list, the "z"
coordinate and its nullification of NPC's ability to summon, and multiple
atmospheres (e.g. water/land) to arrange dragon-type encounters so they
could attack without getting hit back for the vast majority of the time that
it took to kill the monster. In short, what they did was carefully
orchestrate 100,000+ hps encounters so that, for 75% or more of the time
that it took to kill the encounter, the monster got beaten on and was not
able to fight back.

In addition, SOE staff observed various members of the guild discussing the
cheating -- these comments include:

"we're useing [sic] massive amounts of exploits and u send a gm down here?"

"Any lead GM shows up, this show is over."

"yeah, this is the most impressive Itz-guyversploit [sic] to date"

"every guild exploits these"

The EverQuest Rules of Conduct state, among other things:

"You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not communicate the
existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or
unintended benefits in game), either directly or through public posting, to
any other user of EverQuest. You will promptly report any such bug via the
in-game "/bug" command or via the eqtesting@verant.com email address."

"Disciplinary issues involving guilds will also be addressed on a broader
basis. Guilds whose members habitually violate any of the Rules of Conduct .
. . may be disbanded."

As a result of this unfortunate incident, (i) most of the participants were
suspended for one week, (ii) a few, who had received previous warnings or
suspensions, were banned, and (iii) this guild has been disbanded.

SOE regrets having to take these measures, but SOE is committed to
protecting the health and viability of the game and of the EverQuest
community. We�d also like to correct a few related misconceptions regarding
this event: (i) Conquest did not complete the encounter � SOE staff
inadvertently spawned the Sleeper during it�s efforts to stop the cheating,
(ii) the "human figures" in some screenshots are a result of the screenshot
taker not patching, and (iii) the zone is complete and working -- once SOE
has patched fixes to these exploits we encourage players to wake the
Sleeper.

We appreciate everyone�s emails with regards to questions and we do hope
this will assist everyone in an understanding of the situation.
