This shouldnt be an issue because it is a "do Ability" and autoattack is not
a Ability.  I think your thinking of your Hotkeys. I could be wrong on what
I think you were thinking, but   /doability #  refers to the Buttons on the
left when you are not in Full Screen mode and have the Abilities button
selected.

Peace
