I had to see why you were condemning Bustamente as a racist, so I went
looking for his involvement with MEChA on the internet.  Aparrantly, during
his student days ar Fresno State, he was an active member of the
organization (this according to an article in FrontPage Magazine.com
[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=9600] by Michelle
Malkin).  This was confirmed in another article, at Townhall.com
(http://www.townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/mm20030820.shtml), by
Michelle Malkin (hmmm...). And another article on WorldNetDaily.com
(http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=34183) by Michelle
Malkin (I think there may be a pattern, here).  Agin, I was able to confirm
it in an article on VDARE.Com by (try and guess... Come on, you can...)
http://www.vdare.com/malkin/bustamante.htm (OK, the link gives it away).  Of
course, this was picked up by Bill "Splotch-Face" O'Reilly, the "Fair and
Balanced" Fox news team and many other conservative wonks
(http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=MEChA+Klan), who
tried to equate MEChA with the Klan at every opportunity.

Now, the truth, MEChA, for a bunch of fascist, hate-mongers, actually has in
it's by-laws that they are forbidden to discriminate based on race (that's a
clever racist for you).  According to Rudolfo F Acuna:  MECHA is a student
organization with no formal central body, it has no national office, it has
no budget, and it has no constitution. Each MECHA chapter has a set of
bylaws that the student affairs office must approve. These bylaws state that
the organization is open to all students no matter their race, sexual
orientation, gender or religion.
(http://www.voznuestra.com/PoliticalWires/_2003/_August/29).  Oh, and the
Southern Poverty Law Center does not consider MEChA to be a hate group
(http://www.tolerance.org/maps/hate/state.jsp?state_id=5).  The Hate
Directory does not list them (http://www.bcpl.net/~rfrankli/hatedir.htm),
nor does The Ross Institute
(http://www.rickross.com/groups/hategroups.html).

Something about the conservative news media makes me want to take a shower
every time I watch or listen to it.

Now, those are facts that I am arguing.  Not emotions.  The neo-con media
are playing the jingoistic fear cards, not the liberals.

See?  My point, exactly.  Oh, wait.  That would mean you think ill of
Palestinians, also.
