Aye, I play on a Toshiba 5005-s507 - very similar but has 32Mb Geforce 440
ToGo.

Most zones are great. Luclin zones can get REAL laggy though. Way more lag
than I get on a Duron 950 with Geforce 2 32Mb desktop. I've tried a bunch of
changes to help with the lag, but nothing has completely solve it. It is
definitely correlated to the amount of data being transfered over the net,
to right hand number on the net status bar. I'm sure the modem is just a
Winmodem with software DSP, I'll bet the on-board NIC is the same. A
hardware modem may solve the problem for me.

Oh yes, the machine has WinXP Home on it as well. This may have something to
do with the lag ?.
