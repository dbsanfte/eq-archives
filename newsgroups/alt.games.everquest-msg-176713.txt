...now imagine going from skill 188 to skill 248 by brewing minotaur hero
brew.  a NINE item combine.

of course, the ctrl+click thing that everybody else mentioned helps ;)

as for making money, it's all about getting into the right skill at the
right time.  my baker has pulled over 200kpp out of the baking market on
karana in the past few months.  my jewelcrafter has barely managed to make
back the 3k that he spent getting his skill to 250.  i have made myself some
decent resist gear though ;)

Meerina
196 brewer and sick of it already!
182 fletcher and too broke to make better arrows!
Amalena
250 baker - 192 and up from misty thicket picnics, 8 item combine!
Mystarr
250 Jewelcrafter
