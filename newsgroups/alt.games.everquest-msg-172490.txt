It was the impression I got reading Game's website (product out of stock now
so it doesn't give further info) and Amazon's wasn't too clear on what it
included, although now they are offering it with PoP so that would make it
pretty obvious. The product we kept seeing for sale was some special edition
version in a Tin but now I can't seem to find that either.
Anyway, thanks for clearing that up for us.
