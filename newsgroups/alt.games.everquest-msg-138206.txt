Well... when I was new, I remember a time when I had multiple characters 
before I knew -anyone-, much less knew anyone well enough to trust them 
with my carefully-crafted raw silk tunic.  So given the option between 
twinking *right now* and twinking when I have a guild or friends, given 
that that could be weeks for all I know, *right now* has quite a bit of 
appeal.  Of course, it should be obvious even to a total newbie to use a 
low-traffic area...  I only remember once when I felt totally screwed.  
I'd dropped a backpack of stuff that had something lore in it that 
character two already had, and couldn't remember which thing was lore or 
why I couldn't pick up the backpack, or why the stupid thing had vanished 
when I clicked on it, and of course it poofed before I could switch back 
to character one.  The guide was very polite when he told me he couldn't 
help me. :( Stupid Allize Volew Medicine Bag, anyway.
