Once again, I disagree.  Some Rangers may whine about post-epic
2handers, but the lower Offense and weapon skill caps Knights
have hold their damage down well below that of other classes.

Necros have been broken since day one.  Back early when they
"nerfed" the Necro all that did was to make it so that an IQ
of at least room temperature was required to play one.  This
had the effect of reducing the (observed) Necro population by
about half.  They were still, and remain, stronger than Druids,
they just aren't quite as easy to play and they don't get ports.
The Beastlord is a pet handler, that is very nearly the entire
power of the class.  The Mage is a pet handler with some very
substantial secondary magical powers.  None of these is relevent
in discussing a Cleric "pet", except that any "pet" the Cleric
might get ought to be, frankly, extremely weak in comparison.
(Returning briefly to the Necro, why in hell does a powerful
straight-up caster have a major pet to begin with?????)

As you noticed, my big bitch is that this effectively pushes the
Paladin off beyond the margin.  An SK can be an effective puller,
which is a major role to play in a raid or a group, with off-tank
and emergency tank as secondary roles.  WTF is the point of a
Paladin now?  It used to be I got razzed for wearing obsolete
gear... I've upgraded my gear some, but I can't do a damned thing
about VI obsoleting my class.
