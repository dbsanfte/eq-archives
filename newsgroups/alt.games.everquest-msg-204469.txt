You can't tell it from the item description window for instruments, but
most instruments are 2-handed offhand weapons. In order to equip a drum,
for example, your primary slot must be empty. Drop the instrument into
the secondary slot, and voila, you're good to go.

(This is similar to equiping regular 2-handed weapons.... You can't wield
that 2-handed sword if you've currently got a shield in the secondary slot.
You need to get rid of the the shield first...)
