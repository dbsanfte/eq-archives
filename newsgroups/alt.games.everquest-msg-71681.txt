1. Everquest is much slower paced than AC after you get above 15th
level.  I have litterally spent hours, doing nothing, waiting for a
group to form.  

Verant has also strategically placed 'Hell-Levels' to
slow your progress down, and keep you playing (and paying) longer.
It takes twice as much xp to go from level 30 to 31 as it takes to go
from level 31 to 32.  All levels above 50 are Hell-levels.

When you die in EQ you lose xp, unlike AC where you lose vitae.
If you lose enough xp in EQ you lose your level(s).  

EQ is a very time consuming game.

2. Grouping is all but required at the higher levels; Druids can solo
all the way, and at some levels it is faster to solo than play in
groups.  But to get the quality items at higher levels you still have
to be in a group.

The character development system in EQ is class-based, as opposed
to the skill-based system used in AC.  EQ characters are highly
specialized, whereas AC characters are highly customizable.

The drawback to the skill-based system for characters is that
high-level characters can tend to have the same sets of skills.  

To succeed in their goal, killing monsters usually, an EQ party will
need members from different classes.  The system is very similar to
AD&D, in fact, it is a blatant rip-off of AD&D.

3. Socializing is more common in EQ, the long down times between
kills lend themselves to chatting.

4. The EQ world is broken up into zones and is several times smaller
than Dereth, although Verant is adding new areas faster than Turbine.
(At a zone, you are paused while new data is loaded from the disk).

5. There are no client-side hacks or plugins for EQ, atleast they are
not as widely in circulation as they are for AC.

6.  Dying in EQ is much more of a setback than it is in AC, although
you drop all your stuff when you die in EQ, you have longer to get it
back.

7. In AC a gimped character is still playable, in EQ a gimped
character should just be deleted.  

8. The NPC merchants in AC actually sell and buy at prices close to
the real value of items.  NPC merchants in EQ generally buy and sell
items at hugely varying margins.  They will pay you a few plat for a
fine steel weapons, but then if you want to buy it back it will cost
you 70 or 80 plat.

9. In EQ magic items don't have to be charged like they do in AC.

10. In EQ, if you want to kill a monster that drops a item you need,
there may be a waiting list you have to get on.  Dungeons in AC
tend to be fast paced, where you constantly move.  In EQ, you
fight your way down into the dungeon to a particular place and
stay there - killing the same mob over and over again, ie camping.

11. EQ has a faction system, I am not sure if UO has one or not,
but I know AC doesn't have an equivalent.  Basically NPCs that
you have bad faction with hate you and will kill you, NPCs that 
you have good or neutral faction with will sell to you and give
you quests.
