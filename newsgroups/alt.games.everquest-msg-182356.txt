The trick to MSeru is where you camp.  Fight near the Santus Seru zoneline
instead of near Netherbian.  There are five MOB types here, Stonegrabbers,
Zelniaks, Lightcrawlers, Greyhoppers and Beetles.  Of the five, only the
Lightcrawlers and Zelniaks will aggro for no reason. The others will not
aggro unless you are fighting one of thier kind.  Also, the only MOBs that
the guards will kill for you are the Zelniaks and Lightcrawlers.

Greyhoppers are the easiest and offer the best exp for ease of kill.
Stonegrabbers are pretty tough and a real pain.

If you pull all the way back near the tunnel entrance you won't get any
wandering MOBs and the guards can always handle any extra Zelniaks or
Lighcrawlers adds.

There is also a camp in another area of bandits (Recusos) that are rarely
camped and offer pretty good exp.

I agree.  I never liked that zone, but thought I'd mention it.
