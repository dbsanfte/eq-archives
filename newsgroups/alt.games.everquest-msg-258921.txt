When my chanter got into his 50's I started getting VERY nervous about
the cost of high level spells.  I started tracking research pages in
the bazaar closely and upping my research, mostly by just paying the
trainer.  Pretty much daily I'd bring on my trader and check page
prices.  I occasionally found the rare pages for spells like KEI or
Speed of the Brood selling for perhaps a hundred plat.  Research is
certainly worth while, it just takes a *lot* of patience.  Making some
of those level 60 spells ended up paying for some higher level spells
like VoQ (well, that plus a loan from my wife's druid).
