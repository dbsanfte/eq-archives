I agree with you here.  AC is the better option and is really not
dangerous at all.  Get a KEI if you want, to make the roots and heals
easier.  Only thing is you gotta make sure to pull them correctly to
prevent adds (which cut in to mana).  And headshot helps a *lot*. 
Damn annoying healers...

I got around 500 per hour in drops there, plus acrylia, plus a little
experience, plus a few acrylic BP and Grimlings skin masks...far
better than TM.
