Having youre computer connected for hours while youre afk is bad bad bad.
Costs me bandwidth, costs sony bandwidth which is passed down to us
eventually, maybe there will be a thunderstorm tonight and blow up my modem,
or while im at work tomorrow, maybe ill disconnect after 10 mins and be
sitting in character select all night, maybe someone else wants to use the
computer.

I dont see why. So many people seem to be logged in 24/7 in the bazar with
at least 1 mule, I doubt offline trading would make it all that much worse
(better?). At least everyone could be a trader, instead of just those with
broadband.

They can already. Trivial loot code keeps the farming under control tho, not
that farming is really much of an issue in eq these days. Lack of newbies
and a vast oversupply have made farming less rewarding.
