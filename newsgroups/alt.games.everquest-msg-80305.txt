People keep reccomending places that you can go where you have to
actually sit at the controls and swim "laps" or go back and forth. This
amazes me. As if we don't have enough boring downtime in EQ. (Medding
for higher level casters, waiting endlessly for rare spawns, etc.) If
the *only* thing you are doing at the time is working on your swimming,
you don't have to do laps anyplace. Did you all know that you can
"autoswim" just like you auot-run by pushing down the numlock key? Yes?
Well, there you go. You go to a safe spot where you can swim into a
corner of some kind and become stuck. Shift the view angle up slightly
so that you don't have your face in the water (and drown) and then just
go do something else! 

And no, even if your stamina is below 100, you will NOT drown. No matter
how long you go, your stamina bar will just cycle through at the bottom
of the line and make no difference. (Yes, I've tested this on characters
above and below 100 stamina.) That whole "below 100 stamina" thing is
another one that belongs in the current Bad Facts thread.

My favorite spot is the pool in North Freeport near the office of the
people. (PRoviding you're not KOS, that is.) Jump in, swim up into a
corner up against the wall. I did that with my troll and my necro, went
to watch a DVD, came back and Voila! Max swim skill. Very nice.

There are, I'm sure, other equally useful spots for those KOS in NFP.
