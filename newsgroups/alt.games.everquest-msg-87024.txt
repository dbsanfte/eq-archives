It splits the risk in the sense that the person with the
cash risks losing half the fee (at most), and the
person MQ'ing then risks (at most) giving up the quest
item for half of his desired price.

At one stage or another, each is at risk for a portion
of the transaction (which isn't the case in the other
scenarios suggested), and neither can be screwed for
more than 50% of the value of the transaction.

It is true that the payer is at risk first.  However,
he's not on the hook for the entire price.  And the
quest item holder then has to take a risk himself.
