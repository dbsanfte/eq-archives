Yeah!  What's in the water right now?  Sunday, we were very carefully and
diplomatically dealing with some leadership issues, and it got a little
tense, and lines got drawn.  The next night, two guildmates got into a fight
with another guild member.  It's freaking me out, because our guild is NEVER
like this. . .

Anyone else suddenly having drama?  It's craaazy.
