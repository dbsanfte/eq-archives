Assume for the sake of arguement that 50/50 levels you up in twice the time as 100/0
and gives you an AA in half the time that 0/100 would.

With this split, you wait twice as long and then suddenly get two benefits.

To me, a larger space and then larger reward wouldn't be nearly as much fun as smaller
rewards spaced more closely together.

But that psycological effect aside, how about tangible benefits.  As a rule, a new level
means more power, more HP, fewer resists, better chance of resisting mob spells... and
for casters, new spells (every level between 50 and 61 is a spell level, 62 probably
is... not till 63 do spells tend to vanish)
Get that level up and you will be gathering experience at a faster rate.

AA, particularly at the OP's level, means something useful too... in his case, run 1.
There is perhaps no AA thats a bigger boost in the game than the one you'll get for run
1.

So 100/0, you reach 52, then go 0/100, and achieve that AA... getting that AA more
quickly due to level, so that your net 52 + AA is shorter than the 50/50 method

Or 0/100 until you get Run 1, then go 100/0, and get 52... and you get that ding more
quickly due to run 1, so that your net AA + 52 is shorter than the 50/50 method.

This doesn't start to fall apart until you get up past 60, where exp mobs for soloers
become much more problematic, and until you get into the AA levels where a point or two
here or there really isn't going to make any difference, you are shooting now for 3
more, 6 more, 12 more.  If all you get when you ding an AA point is... a ding noise that
marks partial progress towards your next goal, if all you get from leveling is a more
restricted exp environment, then 50/50 won't matter so much.
