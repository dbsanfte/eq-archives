I thought I never would get to 250 but I'm 220 now while using archery
and one more dkp win will probably put me over the top. However only
at 160 meleeing because I bag swifty and my +atk cloak in favor of a
much better dps weapon and 41% haste cloak.

I'd like to get way over so I can bag swifty and upgrade certain other
spots where I have +atk, though.

Yeah. Plus it'll make epic 1.5 easier to get. :-)
