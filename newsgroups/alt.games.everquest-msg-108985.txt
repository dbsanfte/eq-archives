I looked at his AA points list:

First Aid 2 / 3
Improved Natural Run Speed 3 / 3
Improved Natural Lung Capacity 2 / 3
Improved Natural Metabolism 1 / 3
Improved Natural Regeneration 3 / 3

Combat Agility 1 / 3
Combat Fury 2 / 3
Combat Stability 1 / 3
Finishing Blow 2 / 3
Improved Natural Durability 1 / 3
Natural Healing 3 / 3

granted, I don't know much about AA points, but I have friends who play on a
regular basis that are level 60, and don't have this many points.
