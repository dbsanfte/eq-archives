Why not just get him/her fired for destruction of company property? Line the 
cracks on the bottom of the tv dinner trays with aluminum foil, or take duct 
tape and apply several thin metal items (paper clips) to the bottom fo the 
tray.. I'm betting that he'll be as surprised as everyone else by the 
ensuing light and smoke show that will take place in the microwave.. and if 
you want to be able to eat it yourself without a mess, just peel it off 
before you throw it in the microwave. Just a thought... otherwise I'd throw 
a butt load of alum powder in the food. non-fatal.. but defanetly something 
the thief won't soon forget.
