On its face thats patently untrue unless you are referring strictly to the
Warrior/Monk class. All other hybrid tanks ( ranger, paladins, and shadow
knights ) all have at least a couple of the abilities you mention above.
Ranger get both root, snare, and DOT's, in addition to small nukes, SoW,
Invis, and modest healing ability of thier own. Shadow knights get snare,
fear, Invis, and a variety of Taps, and Dots, along with the ability to have
a smallish pet to fight with them. Paladins get a goodly amount of stuns,
Roots ( I believe, Some one correct me if Im wrong ), blind, and excellent
healing abilities. Factor in that both shadow knights and pallies are plate
classes, and rangers get AMAZING Archery abilities ( albeit later in life )
and any of the above are able to solo up into the higher levels with even
modest gear.
