Didn't they fix that a little over a year ago? Used to there was a chart of
how many EXP points each race/class needed to LV up.  So some class/race
combos would hit 50 or so while with the same EXP another would only be in
20s-30s.  Then they added an EXP multiplier to even things out (because I
think it was proportionally accurate the whole way from LV1-60).  They also
added another EXP multiplier to remove class penalties (or race, one of the
two) while keeping others.  I remember a big thing was that Iksar SKs were
at a BIG disadvantage because of a 40% penalty then another 25% with that,
while Halfing Dr00ds LVed the quickest (which in effect was a big mistake
because it attracted certain mentalities to choose them more as they could
become ubber and get ph4t l3wt faster).

And also regarding "ph4t l3wt", I remember reading on an "EverQuest
eastereggs" page that someone had posted a link to it here, about a Velious
Quest involving "ph4t l3wt" where you "hello" some guy instead of "hail"
him, he scolds you and referrs you to another guy in the quest, who
continues this sort of thing until you finally get to a guy who if you asked
for "ph4t l3wt" he scolds you just seconds before hitting you with an
instant death spell.

What was that page again? It showed allot more hidden jokes the programmers
put into EQ.
