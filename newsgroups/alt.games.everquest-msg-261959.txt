You might want to try out the high side of Echo Caverns -- you get to
it by going south from the Nexus zone in through the short folks area.

The guards in the zone will assist you if you get the critters there
within range. I also found that it was possible to run and keep ahead
of any pursuing critters too.

Down a side tunnel to the left after zoning in, you can find an
elevator which leads to a lower level and four underbulks. These are
the easiest and should be DB at 41 and turn LB by 42 or 43.

Up the main tunnel on the right are a bunch of gnomes, further up the
main tunnel is a four underbulk camp (DB to 44+). They are tougher
than the elevator underbulks but can be pulled singly.

Further up the main tunnel is the side tunnel to the Taskmaster. There
is a small then large chamber with a random spawn of stonegrabbers,
fungal fiends, and underbulks. Beyond them is a short passage to the
Taskmaster and his undead slaves. FYI, I found that at the boundary
between the small and large chamber is where you are likely to get
adds if you pull in the wrong order -- I suggest after clearing the
single spawn from the small room, you pull the left hand spawn of the
two.

The Taskmaster can be pulled without adds but not vice versa (so I am
told).

At the end of the main tunnel is a large chamber with spawns of fungal
fiends, underbulks, and stonegrabber. There is also a wanderer that is
a random spawn. In the far corner is the passage to The Deep, a pretty
safe escape route.

Spawn times is 20? minutes. 

This part of EC cannot handle too many people for the spawns run out
fast. When it's empty, there is probably enough to keep a soloer
fairly busy.

Place is mostly LB by late 40's or so. But if you get it to yourself,
you can wring a fair amount of xp and plat from it from the speed of
clearing mobs and the drops (e.g. stonegrabbers here often drop 3-8
plat).
