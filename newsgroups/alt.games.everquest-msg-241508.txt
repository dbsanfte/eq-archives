}This really needs to be updated as it's only through Velious.  I did add 
}the Agent Sinzan link to the bottom...

Good job, Graef. :)

}And of course Play the tutorial!

Whoops, there's update #1. :)

Do these still have even the vaguest validity?

Also should add www.eq-toolbox.com in there somewhere.

}2.2    Q: What do I need to play Everquest?
}Note: Win95 is no longer supported.

Nor is Dx8.1. This section may need a serious going-over.

}2.3    Q: What are these expansions I keep hearing about?
}A: There have been three expansion packs to EverQuest so far, the Ruins 
}of Kunark, the Scars of Velious, and Shadows of Luclin.

And PoP, LoY, LDoN, GoD.

}2.4    Q: What is the Ruins of Kunark?
}2.5    Q: What is the Scars of Velious?

2.5.1  Q: What is Shadows of Luclin?

Adds Nexus spires to somewhat facilitate transportation, The Bazaar, a 
place to trade items with other players, and new, more detailed player 
models.  Also added more hunting areas for all levels, four city zones, 
the beastlord class, and a new playable race, the Vah Shir. 

2.5.2  Q: What is Planes of Power?

Raises the level cap to 65, greatly expands the Alternate Advancement 
options available, adds ability to form raids of up to 72 people, and adds 
a very efficient transportation system, with direct teleportation to most 
major cities.  Provides additional hunting grounds for levels 46 and up.

2.5.3  Q: What is Legends of Ykesha?

Adds expanded bank space, in-game maps, the story window, a log journal, 
Frogloks as a playable race, and a few new hunting zones for level 40 and 
up.

2.5.4  Q: What is Lost Dungeons of Norrath?

Provides instanced dungeons... I hate LDoN.  Someone else write this one.
Augments.  Umm.

2.5.5  Q: What is Guardians of Discord?

I defer to someone who's been there. :)  Tribute system, good fishing, 
blah blah.

}2.7    Where are the Everquest servers located?
}A: The entire EverQuest (EQ) universe (at present, 40 separate worlds) 
}is run on approximately 1,000 servers. These are located in an onsite 
}datacenter and at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego, less than a mile from our 
}offices). The mix is about 60/40 (here vs. AT&T CERFnet) The Antonius 
}Bayle server is located in the UK.
}Note: Information is being updated.

Ahh, yup.

}3.3    Q: What is this "Tome of Order and Discord" book I have in my 
}inventory?  What should I do with it?
}A: Destroy it immediately.  If you give this book to the Priest of 
}Discord (there is a Priest of Discord in or nearby any city that you can 
}start off in) then you will join the ranks of "Discord"... you become a 
}"player killer."

Might rephrase as, "What's the PoD for?" or "How can I become a PK?"
 
}3.6    Q: I want to transfer one character from one EverQuest account I 
}have to another.  Can I do this, and if so, how?
}A: Yes, you can, for a $50.00.Full details can be found at
}https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves/index.jsp

}3.7    Q: How do I alt+tab out of EverQuest and return to the game?  It 
}would really be helpful if I could use Notepad or the web while I'm 
}playing?
}A: Unfortunately, in an effort to make it more difficult for somebody to 
}hack his or her client software, Verant has disabled effective 
}alt+tabbing in EverQuest.  It is possible to Alt+Tab out of EverQuest 
}(as you may discover if you accidentally do so), but it is impossible to 
}get back into the game.

Alt-Enter

}3.9    Q: How do I make a hotkey?
}A: Run the tutorial.exe program in your EverQuest directory. It covers 
}many of the basics of the game, including the creation of hotkeys.  The 
}user interface of the actual game is somewhat enhanced from the 
}interface in the tutorial program, but is similar enough that you should 
}be able to make the transition easily.
}NOTE: It appears that some versions of the game do not install the 
}tutorial.

I think that's up to 'most' or 'all'. :)

}3.10    Q: How do I make a spell a hotkey?
}A: Run the tutorial.exe program in your EverQuest directory.  It covers 
}many of the basics of the game, including the creation of spell hotkeys. 
}The user interface of the actual game is somewhat enhanced from the 
}interface in the tutorial program, but is similar enough that you should 
}be able to make the transition easily.

And again...

}3.15    Q: What are all these abbreviations and acronyms?  What does it 
}all mean?
}A: This site has an excellent glossary
}http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm

Gone. :(

}4.    Glossary of Newsgroup acronyms
}FUBAR: Fucked up Beyond All Recognition
}WTF: What The Fuck

Shouldn't that be "F!cked"? :)
