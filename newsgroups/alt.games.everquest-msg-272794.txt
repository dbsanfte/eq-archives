Whoa, pardon me. But didn't you say this could be done with a level 1
char? And from reading your description it doesn't sound very
complicated or dangerous to assume otherwise. So SoE really intends lvl1
chars to wear THIS? I know the charm from the tutorial isn't that far
off stat wise. But if they keep at it then they could discard the whole
newbie quests.

I'd vote for a lvl50 button on the char creation screen then.^^
