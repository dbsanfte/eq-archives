I think they were just mislead, looking at all the replies.

Between the Pal, Clc, and Rng, I would hope they can get it snared / rooted 
before I get in, so we'll probably send me in after the Rng.  Thanks for 
poinint out the "running" part ( your other reply ).

The last raid, we took the right side entrance via Lev and climbing the 
wall to the east of it.  If there's no real reason to ( like avoiding the 
trap which doesn't seem possible ), then we'll go up the gut if we fight 
in.

What are the benefits of going right if you are doing Prince on the way?  
Why not go left and set up in the room to the south and pull Prince's room 
there?

Unless we have another chanter join who needs Prince, we probably won't hit 
Prince on the way in, so this may be moot anyway.
