I just moved, and I had a cable modem installed.  I can only play
for about 15 to 45 minutes before the cable modem flashes, all
the lights go out and I get kicked out.  I don't think my cable
modem is dropping as I could get right back in, it would drop me
to the server selection screen.  Here is what I have tried with
minimal success.

Turned off all chat lines other than
    Mob hitting me
    Me hitting mob
    My casting
    Group
    Say
    Guild

Server Filtering is ON
Spell Effects are OFF
Clipping plan is at a min
Sound is at a min
Mip is off
3D sky is off
(a bunch of other Displays are off or at a min)

Anyone have any idea why I keep getting disconnected.  My manual
for the modem was a single 8.5X11 piece of paper.  Any help will
be greatly appreciated.

JB
