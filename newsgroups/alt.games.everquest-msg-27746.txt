VENTURA COUNTY
Rape Suspect Charged With 57 Criminal Counts
Hearing: Vincent Sanchez does not enter a plea to accusations involving 11
attacks. His roommates explain why they became suspicious.

   
       
By MARGARET TALEV and TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS


A suspected serial rapist was charged with 57 criminal counts Tuesday for
allegedly sexually assaulting 11 women in Simi Valley during the past five
years.

Vincent Henry Sanchez, a 30-year-old part-time movie studio employee,
appeared briefly in Ventura County Superior Court but did not enter a plea
to the charges, which include counts of kidnapping, rape and assault with a
deadly weapon. His arraignment was postponed until Aug. 10.

Sanchez is being held in lieu of $1-million bail. Prosecutors will ask a
judge this week to hold him without bail, however, saying that he poses a
threat to the community. "The defendant has been terrorizing Simi Valley
for the past five years," Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee said after Tuesday's
hearing. "He is an extreme danger."

Police said they were awaiting the results of DNA tests, which they hope
will directly link Sanchez to at least three rapes. This week they obtained
a search warrant to compel Sanchez to provide a blood or saliva sample, a
police spokesman said.

Sanchez is accused of breaking into the homes of women late at night and
sexually assaulting them at knifepoint. In other cases, he allegedly
kidnapped women, drove them to isolated locations and attacked them.

Despite a five-year investigation that included a six-member task force,
analysis of hundreds of DNA samples and assistance from the FBI and other
agencies, Simi Valley police said they had no solid leads until last week.

The break came after Sanchez was arrested Thursday on suspicion of an
unrelated burglary at a neighbor's home. Over the weekend, his roommates
searched the house and uncovered evidence they believed linked Sanchez to
sexual assaults.

One of the roommates contacted police, and Sanchez was arrested Sunday on
suspicion of rape, burglary and kidnapping.

On Tuesday, his roommates recalled the break in the case.

Their neighbors had told them that several items were missing from a house
they were selling, including a shower head and a screen door.

When Sanchez's roommates checked their rented five-bedroom tract house,
they found some of the missing items stashed around the yard, they said.

Adding to their growing suspicions, roommate Steve Frueh recalled Tuesday,
was a call from Sanchez from jail--a call that ultimately led one of the
roommates to call police.

"Vincent said, 'You need to dig something out of the trash for me, personal
pictures of me and my girlfriend,' " Frueh said.

Frueh said Sanchez asked him to dispose of the items.

"I said OK, but then I got curious," he said. "I opened the bag up and it
wasn't him and his girlfriend. It was nasty pictures and videotapes . . .
six or eight pairs of panties, gold jewelry."

The roommates flipped through two dozen or so pictures, Frueh said, and saw
women they did not know. The women were naked on beds or in chairs, in some
cases tied up. In most, their eyes were half-shut and appeared glazed over,
Frueh said.

Roommate Josh Reno watched part of one video; he said it showed a man
wearing a mask, gloves and black clothing, and a naked woman whose leg
appeared to be bleeding. He said police asked him not to share other
details about the video and the accompanying audio.

"Once I saw it, it was full shock," he said. "I called 911."

On Tuesday, the home Sanchez shared with four roommates had been turned
inside-out by police. Cushions from a sofa had been taken for lab tests.
Clothing, videotapes and other items were strewn about the living room
floor.

Sanchez has lived at the home for five years. He had become increasingly
aggressive, reclusive and unreliable over the course of the last year, his
roommates said, borrowing money and treating his girlfriend poorly. Still,
they said, there was no reason to believe he was involved in anything
sinister.

"We didn't have a clue," said Frueh, who has lived at the house only two
months, but has been Sanchez's neighbor and acquaintance for years. "I feel
like puking. My stomach feels kind of queasy."

Reno, who has lived at the house for four years, said he and Sanchez
initially were buddies. The two took trips together. On their travels,
Sanchez usually took a video camera, Reno said. The videos were goofy and
harmless, usually involving the roommates hamming it up.

Reno said they visited Sanchez's parents in the Palmdale area, whom he
described as caring and stable. Reno said Sanchez also had a brother who
seemed friendly and usually paid Sanchez's rent for him.

But Reno and Frueh said their relationship with Sanchez soured over time.

Los Angeles court records show that Sanchez served two years in state
prison for injuring the child of a former girlfriend while they lived
together in Lancaster.

Simi Valley police said Sanchez also has a record for burglary.

Sanchez faces consecutive life prison terms if found guilty of the rape
charges and related allegations.
