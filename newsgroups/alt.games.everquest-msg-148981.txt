Yeah, but the flip side is having to tell some newbie with a lost, but not
hidden, corpse, that you can't help them because the corpse is recoverable
by normal non-summoning means.  (Although the changes to newbie death and
the low level corpse summon spell help here).

That sad fact is that if you want to help people, you can do more in most
cases by getting a second computer and running ShowEQ than you can by being
a guide.
