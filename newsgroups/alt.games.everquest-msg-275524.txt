Wow, on EMarr, there were pickups for getting to fire at least, quite a 
few of them.  They did occur after GoD and LDoN were released for the 
most part (meaning the uber guilds were busy working on GoD by then), 
but, they were fairly regular.  Many people got their elemental flags 
that way.  Being on Australian time however would complicate things I 
would expect.
