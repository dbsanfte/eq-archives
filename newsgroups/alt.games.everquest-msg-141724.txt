If I had the coin...err cash to buy it and if it had EVERY zone including the
zones from P.o.P. I'd consider it.  One of my biggest problems in EverQuest is
I'm a coward when it comes to new zones. Heh.  If I get lost in a zone I don't
know I start to freak out. lol.  The book might help me quite a bit.
