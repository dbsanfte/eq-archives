Congratulations on choosing to play one of the most difficult classes
in the game (right up there with enchanters).  You'll want to consider
charisma as something to raise, Dex and the like are also important.
You'll want some sort of decent str, bards are a plate wearing class
after all.  Armor can get quite heavy.

Don't sweat the stamina too much, you aren't a primary tank.  Even
soloing, your primary strategy will be to stay out of attack range.
You should be thinking of yourself as a utility caster with a sword,
really.  You don't equal any of the "warrior" types in hand to hand,
and you never will.  Let the warrior types take the critter head on,
you want to slip into its side and annoy it with a few cuts, while
keeping up a constant twist of music to aid your party.
