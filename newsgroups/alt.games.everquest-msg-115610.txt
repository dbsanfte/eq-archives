Heh... Okie, you got me there.. But of the three of those skills, Pottery is
the easiest to master, and very cheap....  Everything you need to master
pottery can be easily found in one zone - North Freeport...  I know
Thurgadin is good about that too.

Time to go from 0 to over 100?  Less than an hour...  Heh...  But then, I
knew I was going after the Shawls, and needed pottery to make the Thurgadin
Gate potion...  (Now, if I can only spawn the guy I need to give it too
without getting trounced by the Death Squad, I'll be in good shape.  :) )
