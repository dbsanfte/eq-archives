That's the "extended" part.  With focus items and the right AA points spent,
buffs can last up to 70% longer.

So, for example, when I first dinged 65, I could cast Hand of Virtue and
have it last 2 hours and 30 minutes.  Now that I have Spell Casting
Reinforcement 3 and Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery and a focus item
with Extended Duration IV, Hand of Virtue lasts 4 hours 15 minutes.

Enchanters can do the same thing with KEI.  That's why those with such AA's
will advertise it, to draw business away from those who do not.
