Hello,

I had that problem before and wrote to EQtech, this is the answer I got:


A) Your issue may stem from EverQuest files being in two different
directories. We will want to make sure that only one directory contains
EverQuest.

1) Click on the START button and then select FIND or SEARCH.
2) Select FILES OR FOLDERS.
3) In the NAMED field type "EVERQUEST.EXE" (without the quotes).
4) Make sure the LOOK IN field is set to MY COMPUTER and the INCLUDE
SUBFOLDERS box is checked.
5) Hit the FIND NOW button.

This search should only find one copy of EVERQUEST.EXE. If more than one
is found, note the directories each file is in (this is found in the IN
FOLDER section).  You will need to copy all the files from one folder to
the other.  When copying the files, you will say yes to overwrite files.

Alternatively you can use Windows Explorer to search your hard drive.

1) Click on the START button.
2) Select PROGRAMS.
3) Select WINDOWS EXPLORER.

Browse the hard drive (drives if you have more than one) and look for
multiple EverQuest directories. EverQuest is typically in C:\Program
File\EverQuest, C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest or C:\Program
Files\Sony\EverQuest Trilogy. If more than one is found, note the
directories each file is in (this is found in the IN FOLDER section).
You will need to copy all the files from one folder to the other.  When
copying the files, you will say yes to overwrite files.

B) Your issue may be cause by outdated files. To ensure that all files
are updated correctly we will want to make sure the patcher is
downloading all files.

1) Start EverQuest as normal and let the patcher finish. Do not press
PLAY.
2) Press the ADVANCED BUTTON.
3) Under PACKAGE DOWNLOADS (left side) make sure all boxes are checked
except for LEGENDS. Only check LEGENDS if you are a LEGENDS subscriber.
4) Click the SAVE button.
5) Click the PLAY/DOWNLOAD button
