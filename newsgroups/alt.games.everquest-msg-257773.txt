It

Not unless the Sarnaks have moved in some heavy industrial processing units
that I haven't noticed, which are producing all that smog.  The zone is
split between a few cave areas and a castle area, completely indoors.

I didn't like the change, and didn't think it fit in... but that may just be
because I was used to the zone the other way.  Its possible someone who has
always known it as a foggy zone might not mind.
