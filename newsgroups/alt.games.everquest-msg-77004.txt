LOL thought it was just me.

In case you havent read it this is my post from a couple a days ago:

I live in Croydon, South London, UK
Went to the local shops to buy SoL on dec 7, because I read on Everlore that
the 7th was the UK release date. Visited EB, HMV and Virgin. Nothing. No
copies of any versoin of EQ any where. Went back again on the 17th, still no
sign of SoL or any other version. Got home and ordered SoL from Amazon UK,
it said that the product usually ships within 2-3 days. WOOT. So even with
the xmas rush it would arrive in time for me to play it on xmas day. Dec 27,
I get an email from Amazon. The product is in short supply, it will take 1-2
weeks longer.
Monday 7 Jan, err, still waiting for game.
Oh well.

BTW, I emailed Verant about it, (see below)you tell me if their reply had
anything to do with my query.
(If sony had done this with the playstation they would sold only half the 50
million units, and would have probably been whooped by both Sega and
Nintendo)

I live in Croydon, South London in the UK.
I have just returned from my local shopping centre, (Mall) which I
visited to buy SoL.
I visited 5 vendors, WHSmith, Dixons, HMV, Virgin and Electronic
Boutique.
None of them had SoL on their shelves, nor did they have any other
Everquest products.
I gather that US players have had the benefits of SoL for almost 2
weeks, and that EQ products
are widely available in stores where you are.
The reason the I bought EQ is that I saw it in a store and had heard
that it was good so I bought it.
Also, I know that if I had sent my mother out to buy this game, she
would not have got it for me, and would not think of trying to buy it
over the internet. Many mothers here are like that, not being game
lovers, and this represents a signifigant missed opportunity. You may
have records sales in the US, but what about the rest of us.
