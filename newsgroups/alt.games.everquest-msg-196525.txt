I agree the people should always play what they like. There should be no 
one or two right answers to the question, "What is the best class?" Each 
class *should* have an advantage in certain situations. From this 
account, however, I got the impression that the shaman was dominating in 
areas that a shaman should not necessarily be dominant in, pulling and 
tanking. All things being equal - the monk and ranger having the 
equivalent equipment - the shaman would not have been the best tank in 
the group. Therefore, it was the twinking that made the difference, 
altering the group dynamics in an unorthadox way. The game is geared for 
casters to be lesser tanks than non-casters and hybrids. 

Again, I am merely defending my quip that this could be considered 
supporting data for the argument against (KEI retracted) twinking.

It just seems that twinking to that extent - and don't get me wrong, I do 
twink, just to a far lesser degree - really takes class distinction out 
of the equation. If that's the way Lance likes to play it, more power to 
him. I wouldn't fault him for that. It's hard not to slap that Iksar BP 
and other uber items on your twink if you have them on hand. :)
