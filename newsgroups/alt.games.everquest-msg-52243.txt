Well without diverting into too many hypothetical situations, you will run
around in your new equipment killing things, yet making elementary mistakes
revealing you to be a newbie with a wallet who bought his stuff on eBay,
therefore you will not make friends, you will be shunned. Thus what
exploration you get to do will not be so enjoyable, there will be little
socialization apart from with the rest of the eBay underclass. If that's
playing the game and having fun, knock yourself out :)

Second time around it isn't a struggle. It's a chore, yes, but surely you
changed server for a reason? To be with friends? Have them twink you. To
start afresh? Then start afresh and make that patchwork. . .

  You might suggest he

Twinking with in-game gear is simply less offensive than paying real life
money for items. There is no reason for anybody to buy gear or PP at RL
auction unless they are a first-timer looking for an advantage - it's
simpler and easier to do it ingame if you all ready have a high level
character or 2. This is certainly why I scorn it so much.

Also, the new character

It's true. Some people play the game within the spirit of the rules, others
play to the letter when necessary and disregard the rules entirely when they
can get away with it. The latter are the ones that buy stuff for RL money
and will have a /petition hotkey ready for any situation. I lump them all
together in one category: Idiots.
