Part of the monk Epic quest involves going to Nurga, and handing in an
item to "a sleeping ogre" to get Trunt (another ogre)   to spawn.

He spawns past the gobbies and near the spiders, by a lava crack that
emits steam.

His spawn cycle is every 3 hours, and again the sleeping ogre is just
the PH for the real mob  trunt.

Problem is that this week at least 4 times I have camped in excess of
the three hours and he has not spawned.  Each and every time I was the
only palyer in the zone the entire time.

I'm on brell...anyone else notice this?  Do we have another mon epic
quest issue like we did a couple of months ago on Karanas where the
shaman's were not spawning?
