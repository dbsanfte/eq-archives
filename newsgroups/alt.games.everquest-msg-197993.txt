You don't happen to be in "Work Offline" mode in Internet explorer?
 "File --> Work Offline" (Make sure no tick next to it)
This will cause this fault.

Have had this happen a couple of times. The last time,
I sent an e-mail to tech support, got a reply back in
a fairly short amount of time and provided them with
the information they wanted. Within a couple of days,
it started connecting again on it's own. About a week
later, tech support sent back it's advice ('don't have
any programs running while running EQ') but that's not
what the problem was because I changed *nothing* when
it started connecting again.

Today, again, connectivity failure. The patcher won't
even start running. Any ideas on what's going on?
