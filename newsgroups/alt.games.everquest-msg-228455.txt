Hmm...how about something kind of like DAoC does for skills within a class,
but get rid of the classes?  So...

1. You get skill points as you level.

2. You raise skills by spending skill points.

3. At certain points, you get "free" retrains.  Say, for a game with 60
levels, at level 20, 40, and 60.  A retrain would let you take a certain
number of skills back to 1, returning the skill points you spent on them.

4. There would be items you could obtain that give retrains.  In DAoC, these
drop off dragons, and there are two kinds, I believe--one that you can use
to reset a single skill, and one that resets all skills.  These are
tradeable in DAoC.

5. It might be a good idea to have different kinds of retrains.  For
example, there might be melee retrains, that let you move points between
melee skills, but not from melee to spell skills, and spell retrains
that work similarly for spell skills, and there could also be retrains
(harder to obtain) that do let you move points between melee and spells.
I'd suggest having limited retrains, too...say an item that lets you reduce
a skill by 10 points, rather than reducing it all the way.

This system would let you be very flexible, without locking you in, yet
making it so changing skills isn't something you can just do one a whim.
