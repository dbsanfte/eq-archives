Greetings one and all,

The reason for my posting this here is that, living in Australia, Verant
Tech support is simply not around during my waking hours.

I finally took the plunge and bought EQ. Now after having downloaded all
the patches, created a account etc, I was eager to begin my life in
Norrath.

But....
Everything is fine until I click 'Enterworld' after creating a character.. 
At that point the standard Windows mouse cursor appears in the middle of
the screen - motionless, and unmovable using the mouse. Also, icons in the
systray - such as my dial up networking status - appear through the EQ
graphics.

Upon actually arriving in the world, the game locks up prettty much as soon
as I move, At this time the windows mouse cursor becomes active, though my
system is unresponsive to keyboard, or other inputs and I have to reboot.
If I stand still and do nothing, rather than walk around, the time it takes
until this lock up occurs is increased a little (maybe 20 seconds).

Now my question is : is there a simple solution to this which I have
overlooked.

I have tried new drivers for my video card, reinstalling various hardware
through Device Manager, disabled sound. etc.


Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

Xannis.
