The problem with this and every other "player policing" proposal I've seen
is that it is way too easy for the asshole players to get around the faction
problem. If you were to /asshole %T, all %T needs to do is get a friend to
create a character of the same race as your character, and have him %saint
%T a few dozen times to fix his faction. Then he could have all his friends
create throwaway characters of each race and have them %saint %T until he is
loved by all. Whenever he screws up his faction, he can just get a friend to
fix it for him. You'd also have the problem of asshole players firing off
multiple /assholes at anyone they got angry at and screwing up their
faction. It's just to easy to exploit this kind of system.

I do think it would be great to have some way to reward/punish PCs for their
behavior if some system that was both fair and unexploitable could be found.

I still don't see how you can blame Verant for the willful acts of
individual players. An analogy would be blaming the Highway Department for
auto accidents because they should have known some people would drive
recklessly.
