Apart from every time you login. Or go to the SOE web site. Or until the
next bidder comes along advertising Coke, Sprite, or Sanitary napkins
for when you just cant leave the chair for that pristine combine.

Companies can make money from me. Thats fine. They can even raise their
prices. I pay them for a service. As long as the service is worth the
price, I'll pay.

When they start making money from other people by using *me* as their
product without my permission, thats when I get pissed off. No, I dont
like unsolicited advertising. Yes, Telemarketers and DVD's with
trailers on them that cant be fast forwarded that I've bought piss
me off too. I am not a product, least of all *your* product to sell on
to others. I am a client. Fuck off, Mercantile Scum.

Matt. Not anti-capitalist, communist nor hippy, whatever assumptions you
care to make.
