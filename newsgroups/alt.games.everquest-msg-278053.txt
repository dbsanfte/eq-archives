I suggest list the one Thomas Houseman gave the link to.
Looks like the good old site,I was used to.
After searching for eqclerics.com on Google,I found a very similar
looking site,but with disgusting IGN advertisements.
Personally I dont use sites with advertisements for selling plat for $
or offering powerleveling services.
Sadly Google has these advertisements too sometimes,when 
searching for EQ related information.
