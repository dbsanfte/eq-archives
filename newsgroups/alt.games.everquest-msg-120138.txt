}> Has anybody an idea what these items are for?
}> Signet Ring - from ToFS in IC.
}No clue on that one.

Yeah, I've worried about that one a lot, but couldn't find a use for it 
either. :/

}> Sonic Wolf Molar  -from HSMoor (I think).
}Trade skill quest in Shar Val I think.

Indeed, it's for the end of the Beastlord Tailoring/Claws quest.  I 
couldn't get one to drop yesterday... :/

}> Vampyre Blood and Vampyre Ashes - from ME.
}Quest for faction in Katta.

Yup.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1302

}> Thought Leech Brain - from Mons Letalis.
}Shield of bane warding in Katta.

Yup.  Heh, my favorite druid was setting up to do this quest last week... 
she was overjoyed to discover that I already had this thing and the black 
flame charcoal sitting in the bank and it was MQable. :)

}> Mark if Battle - from Mons Letalis (other Marks too).
}> Triple Headed Circlet - also Mons Letals.
}> Solstice Rune - No idea of location.
}Those 3 above are used in the twilight sea quests for armor and weapons for
}every class.

I have -sooo- Many twilight armor quest bits... And still haven't gotten 
even one complete set. sigh.

For my own list... Anyone have any clues what a Book of Turmoil is for?  I 
know I have some others, but that's the one I can think of offhand.  Got 
it from the lady in the blind fish in neriak in exchange for her brother's 
head (her brother is the wine quest guy in third gate).
