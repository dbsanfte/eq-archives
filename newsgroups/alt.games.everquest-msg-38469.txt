HOW TO BECOME A MILLIONAIRE IN WEEKS !!!$$$$

HOW TO TURN $30 INTO $50,000!! OR MUCH MORE!! READING THIS COULD CHANGE
YOUR
LIFE!

I started with $30 and I am now a 28 year old millionaire in only 3
months.

I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A little while
back,
I was browsing through newsgroups, just like you are now, and came
across an
article similar to this that said you could make thousands of dollars
within
weeks with only an initial investment of $30! So I thought, "Yeah right,

this must be a scam", but like most of us, I was curious, so I kept
reading.
Anyway, it said that you send $5 to each of the 6 names and address
stated
in the article. You then place your own name and address in the bottom
of
the list at #6, and post the article in at least 200 newsgroups. (There
are
thousands) No catch, that was it. So after thinking it over, and talking

to
a few people first, I thought about trying it. I figured "what have I
got to
lose except 6 stamps and $30, right?" Then I invested the measly $30.
Well
GUESS WHAT!!... within 7 days, I started getting money in the mail! I
was
shocked! I figured it would end soon, but the money just kept coming in.

In
my first week, I made about $125.00.
By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $10,000.00! In
the
third week I had over $40,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my
fourth week and I have made a total of just over $100,000.00 and it's
still
coming in rapidly. It's certainly worth $30, and 6 stamps, I have spent
more
than that on the lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most
importantly, why it works....Also, make sure you print a copy of this
article NOW, so you can get the information off of it as you need it. I
promise you that if you follow the directions exactly, that you will
start
making more money than you thought possible by doing something so easy!
Suggestion Read this entire message carefully! (print it out or download

it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in! It's
easy.
It's legal. And, your investment is only $30 (Plus postage)

IMPORTANT
This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and it is
virtually no risk - it really works!!!! If all of the following
instructions
are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.
PLEASE NOTE
Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and $120,000 or more can be
yours in
20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the honesty
and
integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by carefully
adhering to the instructions. You will now become part of the Mail Order

business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible, it's
a
service. You are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large

corporations are happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the
money made from the mailing lists is secondary to the income which is
made
from people like you and me asking to be included in that list. Here are

the
4 easy steps to success
STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each
piece
of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $5 bills and

place ONE inside. EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be
seen
through the envelope (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in
each of
the 6 envelopes and seal them, MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH STAMPS ON

YOUR ENVELOPES!!(also for international purposes). You should now have 6

sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above phrase,
your
name and address, and a $5 bill. What you are doing is creating a
service.
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a legitimate service and
you
are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little skeptical and a little

worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the
U.S.
Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal!

Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses........


============================================================================

#1) Nicole Franklin, 13576 Birwood, Detroit, MI 48238
#2) Eric LILET, 215 Boulevard E. BOCKSTAEL, 1020 Brussels, Belgium
#3) Antonio Bobanac, Dubrovacka 1, 51000 Rijeka, Croatia
#4) Robert De Bruin, 511 N. West Street # A, Visalia, CA 93291-4807, USA

#5) Linda Baugh, 3220 Duval Rd. apt. # 2806 Austin, Texas, 78759, USA
#6) Maris Serge, Steynstraat 361/4 , 2660 Hoboken , Belgium
============================================================================

















STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the
other
names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number
6 on
the list. STEP 3 Change anything you need to, but try to keep this
article
as close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at
least
200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need
is
200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! **
EVERYBODY
AROUND THE WORLD CAN DO IT, BUT REMEMBER TO PUT ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR
EVELOPES!!!!** This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to

Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of
these
steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again,
and
again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of
the
honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully
adhering to
the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the
program
will continue and the money that so many others have received will come
your
way. NOTE You may want to retain every name and address sent to you,
either
on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This
VERIFIES
that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a good idea
to
wrap the $5 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.) So, as

each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six
members
will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer with 5
dollar
each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when your
name
reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of dollars in
CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $30 ($5 for each of the first six
people listed above) Send it now, add your own name to the list and
you're
in business!

---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO NEWSGROUPS------------
Step 1:
You do not need to re-type this entire letter to do your own posting.
Simply
put your cursor at the beginning of this letter and drag your cursor to
the
bottom of this document, and select 'copy' from the edit menu. This will

copy the entire letter into the computer's memory.
Step 2:
Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top of the
blank
page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a copy of the

letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list.
Step 3:
Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If you want to do your
postings
in different settings, you'll always have this file to go back to.
Step 4:
Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try searching for various
newsgroups
(on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions.)

Step 5:
Visit these message boards and post this article as a new message by
highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from the edit
menu.
Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone sees as they
scroll through the list of postings in a particular group, click the
post
message button. You're done with your first one!

Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to different
newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will take
about
30 seconds for each newsgroup! **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS YOU POST
IN
(Massage-boards etc.) THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT YOU HAVE TO
POST A
MINIMUM OF 200 That's it! You will begin receiving money from around the

world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box due to the
large amount of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous,
you
can invent a name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it. *JUST
MAKE
SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT.**

Now the WHY part Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a
very
low example). So then I made $25.00 with my name at #6 on the letter.
Now,
each of the 5 persons who just sent me $5 make the MINIMUM 200 postings,

each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the
original
5, that is another $125.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM
posts
with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an
additional
$625.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200
with my
name at #3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional
$3125.00! OK, now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a

MINIMUM 200 letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5
replies,
that just made me $15625.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this

message to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per
200
newsgroups react I will receive $78125,00! With an original investment
of
only $30! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just
take
the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send out another $30 to names
on
the list, putting your name at number 6 again. And start posting again.
The
thing to remember is do you realize that thousands of people all over
the
world are joining the internet and reading these articles everyday?,
JUST
LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $30 and see if it really works?? I

think so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one

sends you the money? So what! What are the chances of that happening
when
there are tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining

the
internet and newsgroups everyday and are willing to give it a try?
Estimates
are at 20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day, with thousands of those
joining the actual internet. Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY and this

will really work. Don't let this exciting opportunity pass you by! GO
FOR
IT, AND YOU WILL SMILE WITHIN WEEKS!!!, AS MANY DID
