What I'd like to see if you have a variety of buffs and armour sets to
hand is:

Results with a given AC achieved purely through agility
Results with a given AC achieved entirely through armour
Results with a given AC achieved entirely through "AC" buffs

The same results, for double the amount


The results for double the given AC achieved via armour + agility
The results for double the given AC achieved via armour + ac buffs
The results for double the given AC achieved via agility + ac buffs

All at a static level & defense.

Sui, feeling strangely sullied ;)
