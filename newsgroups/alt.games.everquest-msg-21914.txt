Ah, but I was already out of college at that time and didn't have
cheap enough access to a Unix Shell account.  It was a long distance
call to GEnie and on top of that a six dollar an our charge for use of
the shell through GEnie, too much money for me at the time.

Was Yahoo "browsable" in 1994?  I think it was more of a 1995 start
up, I've been wrong before.  Wasn't Mozolla released in 1993?

Other than PINE how else would one post to Usenet prior to 1993?  A
real question, not a flame.

Remember downloading the "Doom Demo" in 1993 over a local BBS and 2400
baud modem? Hehe...
