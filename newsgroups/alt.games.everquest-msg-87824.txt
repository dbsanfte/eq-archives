    I've seen people pulling through locked doors with EoZ, pull from remote
locations in a dungeon (the now-fixed Phinigel thing) with EoZ, pull masses
of mobs from remote locations with EoZ (monk in Frenzy in Velk's summons
eye, paths it off the ledge, pulls everything from the floor up without
moving a muscle), place mobs where they should NOT be with EoZ (dropping
flurry drakes in the rotunda in ToV).... Hopefully they'll take the next
step and also make the Eye untargettable.
