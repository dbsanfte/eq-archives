Well I took it as "a monk and SK are hitting a mob, who will get the exp?"

Fighting the mob solo (toe to toe) I don't think an SK stands out against a
monk either - sure the SK has bigger hp, he also kills slower and avoids
less, thus taking more damage.  Of course add in fear kite or a cleric and
it's a different story...

Best tank is situational too, I'd say a monk makes a better tank for a
shaman partner.

Shaman speciality:  slow
Monk speciality: avoidance
SK speciality: extra hp

Which 2 compliment each other the most to you?

Remember it's a long long time before shamans get anywhere near a decent
heal spell.
