Pfeh, I pretty much disagree.  An extra spell slot doesn't make you a more 
capable player.  If you weren't capable of having the right spells memmed 
with 8 slots, you probably won't with 9, either.  Frankly, in many 
circumstances, I end up with a slot empty.  A 9th spell slot to me is just 
going to be where I stick some spell I cast once an hourish, like VQ or 
VoQ.

The whole need for more spell slots, imo, dropped sharply (a) with the 
introduction of mounts, making it vastly easier to change spells on 
the fly without drawing aggro, and (b) with the introduction of clicky 
drop-down menus and memspellset, making it possible to completely 
eliminate the 'flipping through spellbook' part of spell switching.  Even 
the /book <page#> command got us halfway there.
  
Swapping in a spell takes literally 2 seconds now, as opposed to up to 
half a minute of page-flipping and clicking before.  That's just long 
enough for the mob to turn and think about hitting you, then you stand up 
and he goes back to the tank.  Ooh scary.  I can even swap spells while 
I'm actually tanking, if the mob's slowed and I time it right.

But level 70... I want that. :)  Some of the 66-70 spells for enchanters 
look -quite- nice. :)
