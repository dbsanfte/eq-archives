You have a different version of XP than I do?  Mine didn't recognize the
GF3 off the bat (at least the Ti200 version of it), and Windows Update
gave me 23.12, which are the latest WHQL-certified Detonators.

Anyways, I haven't noticed any texture problems, but then, I haven't
explicitly turned this option on.  I thought it was on by default, but
could be turned off for older or misbehaving cards.
