What I've generally liked about Blizzard products is the performance
of the games themselves.  Too many game companies these days seem to
release games that run poorly even on expensive cutting edge hardware.
That drives me crazy.  Blizzard has always seemed more reasonable about
hardware requirements and performance.  This is becoming increasingly
more valuable as the average PC life expands.  Most people don't like
the mandatory upgrade every 3 years anymore.  (FWIW, I think SOE is
doing a reasonable job keeping EQ working acceptably on non-cutting
edge hardware too.)

I've also been impressed with how well Blizzard balances their games.
It's not perfect of course but they do a very admirable job of getting
things balanced well right out of the chute.  I think their game
designers are pretty talented.

I'm also impressed with the stability of their games.  They seem to
have less than their fair share of problems which impresses me.  I
think Blizzard has some talented developers working for them.

I'm also impressed with the artists at Blizzard.  Many older Blizzard
games look better at 640x480 than many modern games at 1280x1024.  They
have some extremely talented graphics artists there.

I suspect Blizzard has a good management team (an exceedingly rare
thing these days).  Good leadership makes for happy and productive
employees and good products.  I think their excellent products start
with management that just plain "gets it".

These are a few factors that leave me very hopeful for World of Warcraft.
It might actually run well on my PC and look good too.  And I won't need
to buy a new $3,500 gaming rig to get those results.  I hope.
