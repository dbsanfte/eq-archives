Curious what video card you're using. I'm guessing an nVidia, because my 
experiences with nVidia and this game are not good. My ATI board runs EQ2 
silky smooth and rock solid. Today, at least, nVidia + EQ2 = poopoo.

Huh? That's just flat out wrong information. It's quite easy, for example, 
to get one mob that you need for a quest and then just high-tail it from the 
rest of the group (if you Sprint) without taking on the rest of the group, 
if that's your inclination. I've seen it done and I've done it myself.

Not sure what you mean by "cannot break the group". If by this you mean you 
cannot split them, yes, that's correct. We didn't have a chanter with us but 
if we had, the chanter would have been able to mez three of the mobs, 
assuming they got past resists, etc. Of course, chanters at this level would 
only have the first tier Mez spell, Fascinate, which does have a fairly 
short timer. Remember, we're talking about players in their teens here, in a 
game that supports level 50. How much more do you expect from the first noob 
Mez in the line?

> 2 up arrows means a 2 grp encounter.

Not sure where you got this information but it's false. Think about it. 
Firemyst is a group-instanced zone that can only support one group of six 
players, max. It is heavily populated with double-up arrow mobs. Doesn't 
compute. Double-up arrow means that the mob is a serious undercon, but the 
variability of that cue is about as wide in my experience as the sight of a 
red mob in EQ. You can't really be sure whether it's a couple levels above 
you or something that will whip your ass inside out. I've had both 
experiences.
