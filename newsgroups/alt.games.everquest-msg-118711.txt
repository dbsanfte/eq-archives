I've been consistently missing messages for some time now.  At first I
attributed it to AT&T in my area switching domain names (was mediaone for
awhile).  I couldn't really see why it would cause a problem, but didn't see
any other reason.
Basically, the only reason I ever noticed was I've made posts that never
appeared (only a handful, but have seen them answered), and many times I'll
see a "RE: yadayada" while never seeing the initial post.  This happens to
me a lot.  Now that I see others may be missing posts, maybe it's not just
me.

Maybe it is,
Sean...
