It depends on the game,  how much items cost, how attainable they are
without fee, and how much fun I can have playing for the money I'm willing
to spend.  

Would you play a game that has expansions twice a year that you need to buy if
you want the new stuff?  Would you play a cardgame where some cards are rarer
than others, and available for sale (or available by buying enough booster
packs)?  Would you play a game that allows you to get a higher level of
customer service for a fee?   Would you play a game that charges extra to play
2 characters at once?  Would you play a game where people with lots of time to
play have better stuff than people who only have a few hours a week?

These are all personal value choices, and some will say it's "harmful" to the
fun of the game to charge for it.  Others will say that the provider has to
make money, and if making money from people willing to buy equipment lets them
charge me less, and I can still have fun within my gaming budget, that's good.
