I am also on the Xev server, and I do believe that we were the only server
out there to get hit with this unfortunate exploit. As time wears on,
though... I have begun to be of the opinion that the inflated prices on our
server are leaning less towards "shark aftermath" and more towards "out and
out greed." People are jacking prices up on EVERYTHING, and when questioned
about it, the common answer is "Meh. Our economy is screwed up." This is
seeming to be less and less of what I would deem as accurate, and more what
I would call a cop-out. Even LDoN drops, which theoretically should be far
from rare, are being sold for inflated prices. Something has to change, and
change soon... but I am at a loss as to what might resolve this. I actually
had a terrible incident with a 65 Ranger the other night over a Gemmed
Jeweled Guard Bow... an LDoN drop that I swear I had seen previously in the
3-4k region that suddenly rose to the 7-10k region. I grudgingly bought this
bow from this individual after a bit of a rap about the price. He wanted 8k,
I managed to haggle him down to 7k, and he wouldn't go any lower. (reason?
Xev's "economy") So, after I got it, I pointed out that he should be happy
that he got every last bit of my savings at that time... at which point he
began sending me tell after tell linking his Stonewood Bow, all kinds of
ornate molds, and every piece of ornate armor you can think of, all
punctuated by the requisite "Lol," or "Hahaaaaa..." Long story short, I told
him that he should be ashamed gouging so bad to a member of the same class,
and that he could feel free to shove his high-ticket gear up his ass. Then
he linked an Obsidianwood Bow. Then I put him on ignore. So, here I am,
broke and owner of a bow that just feels... dirty to me. Hindsight is 20/20,
or so they say. So yeah - it's an issue of greed. Anyone on Xev feel
similarly?
