I disagree Lenny.  Bash interrupts casters, and it's very noce with
large race Warriors (OGR/TRL/BAR) who can Slam (same skill as Bash)
without equipping a shield.  I keep both Kick and Bash near max on
Veak as I'm told that at high level Kick is important for positioning
mobs while Slam is useful now when fighting casters.

Warriors don't have to sit before CR, they either just start running
or stop at bank to grab a spare weapon and then start running.  That
assumes that the Cleric is dead, if the Cleric survived they just
stand around scratching themselves until they're rezzed.  At any
rate there is no need to get sit agro from greenies.  :-p

Veak Smash!
