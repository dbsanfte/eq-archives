Speaking of helm problems.. I wish my hair would stop disappearing.

Elder Teir'Dal scrolls? Neat. Oddly enough, dark elves are born with
average skill in Elvish and Elder Elvish, but not in Elder Teir'Dal.
All my wood elf knew was Elvish; are high elves born with a knowledge
of Elder Elvish?

Something like that might also make it possible to exempt the quest
items so high levels could do the Quellious symbol quests, right?
