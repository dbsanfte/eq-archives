I've been playing an erudite necro a lot recently... only had to put
up with a few newbie levels before getting Deadeye, after all.

At any rate, I've been putting up Deadeye any time it dropped,
until recently, when I haven't bothered using it much at all.  At
the time of the change, I was in LOIO, and haven't moved from
there since.  So perhaps the improvement is only in relatively
clear sky outdoor areas.

I bet I still can't navigate the Halas tunnel, or worse still the one
into Surefall, without deadeye up.
