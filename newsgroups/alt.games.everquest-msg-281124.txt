I didn't see that anyone had posted this yet.  The new AAs are listed
here:
ttp://applets.crgaming.com/gplay/action.php?class=25&era=11

Some interesting ones I noticed:
-More base run speed for bards and monks above and beyond run5.  This
sounds like they want to make these two classes better indoor pullers?
(Not that Bards really needed all that much help).  I think this is a
pretty good idea though.
-Druids and Rangers get shared innate camo.  7 second refresh like
normal IC...pretty cool IMO.
-It looks like Rangers and Rogues will get increases in their
headshot/assassinate abilities.  This will bring the max level up to 55
I think?  Man I coulda used this back when loyalist faction was still
an issue.
-Did I read that right, Rogues get a self-evac?
-Necros and SKs get innate camo.
-Pallies get innate ITU.  Whoopdido eh?
-Shaman appear to get a mitigation rune?
-Warriors can become immune to stunning blows
-Warriors can effectively root a mob now by making it refuse to run?
WTF is that?
-It appears that Wizards will be able to prevent mobs from gating.

Some of these abilities are quite radical, IMO.  If gating mobs is a
problem, get a wizard.  If you can't find a snarer, grab that warrior
instead.  Monks running faster than SoW speed, innately?

"Rangers, through years of ranger gating, will now be able to share
their skills at corpse runs by giving the group a fixed duration invis
spell nearly at will."  Boy the clerics and pallies will like that.
