Yes. The EQAtlas map is wrong.  Heh, I told him this when I responded to his
original Sol A post.  Guess he didn't read that :^/>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

I did read it and I've been clearing both rooms but still no luck getting a
drop.  Doubt I've stayed for two hours at any one time though so maybe I'm just
having some bad luck and should stick it out a little longer.  Seems like it
should still be the easiest obtainable item.  I have LDoN and love it but my
gear is not that good and every time I get up to 150 adventure points I'll
undoubtably be getting a piece of the armor that's available since it's much
better than what I'm wearing so the Aug3 is probably not likely for me.
