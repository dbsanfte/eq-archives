My hubby still plays EQ1 every day.  His guildies are active players still 
but he has noticed that is a little bit harder to find buffs in PoK 
recently.  That may be a function of all the patching they've been doing 
too.

I've decided to play EQ2 for a while.  Don't know how long because I gotta 
fight hubby for control of the computer and that gets old after a while.  
Anyone got an extra computer sitting around they can ship off to me so I 
can play when I want?  ;-)
