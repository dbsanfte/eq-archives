While I Loved LDoN too, I always felt it fell short of it's potential.
All it would have taken would have been 5 more zones, one for each of
the themes, with a separate enterance for each of the different
instances.

Woul've kept the 'world' feel, and still allowed the instancing.
Would it be that difficult to put a 'Rujarkian Hills' off the Orc
Highway? Or make a 'Miragul's Castle' linked between Everfrost and the
Gorge?

But they decided to go the easy way, and the EQ world lost a good
chunk of the 'world' feeling, and felt like more of a game.

C'est la vie.
