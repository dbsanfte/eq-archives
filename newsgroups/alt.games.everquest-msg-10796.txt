This isn't playing the game. It's violating the EULA, and, as I've
said several times before, the legality is questionable since the
seller doesn't actually OWN the pp to be selling it. Oh, yeah, the
"selling my time" loophole is BS and wouldn't stand up if put to the
test. Otherwise, hookers could get off by saying "I'm not selling sex,
I'm selling my time".
