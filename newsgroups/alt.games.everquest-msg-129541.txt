May quite likely have something to do with the fact that most of us here are
not advocating that Israel be evacuated of all Jews and turned over to the
Palestinians.  While I abhor what was done to the Native Americans (well,
descendants of earlier settlers really if you want to be technical about
it), I don't advocate turning over the US to them.  I also disagree strongly
with a number of the policies of Israel, but I do not advocate abolishing
the state of Israel.  Your analogy may be appropriate when talking to an
American who does indeed advocate abolishing the state of Israel.

Also, just a minor nit here, but you are aware what anti-semitism is, are
you not?  There are far more non jewish Semites in the middle east than
there are jewish Semites.  Yes, I know, anti-semitism is largely taken to
mean bigotry against jews in particular.
