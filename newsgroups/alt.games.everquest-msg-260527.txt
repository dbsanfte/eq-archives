It's a kind of bug.  To fix it you need to have the looter log out and in. 
Fading memories works also, but you dont get that for awhile.  Dont know if 
any other classes tricks work.  I think what is happening is that floortraps 
are coded as a kind of mob.  If you trigger a trap and it doesnt hit you 
then it will keep you on the aggro list.  The box is coded to not allow 
looting while the player has aggro to prevent ninja looting.
