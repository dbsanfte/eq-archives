The dangers of charm... sounds like my ex.  :)  Agreed that enchanters are
measured by their ability to do CC, and there are damn few these days who
know what they're doing.  I nearly went mad, playing my mage in a group with
a 49 enchanter who was chain-casting AOE Mezz on a three-pull...  anyone who
plays a pet class knows precisely what I'm talking about.  But the
enchanters who DO know their job are remembered!

Remember that charm can be a crowd-control tool as well.  On a nasty
overpull, especially at lower levels when mezz doesn't last long, charming a
mob and using it to offtank uses one spell to take two mobs out of the mix
for as long as a full minute, and returns them both as damaged goods when
charm breaks and it's time to fight them.

Quick note: the level 62 animation hits for 40 to 60, and has about 2k hp.
A dire-charmable bird in PoN (the lowest level mob available in that zone)
hits for 200 to 300 and has 15k hp.  You make the comparison!

Keep two color stuns, mezz, and charm loaded.  Use your level 4 stun and
then  your best stun, with  your finger hovering over your hotkey for the
level 4 stun.  When you sicc your pet on a target, immediately retarget your
pet.  The relatively-new ability to switch between your last two targets is
a godsend to the charming enchanter.

When charm breaks, both mobs are going to head for you ASAP.  If you can,
keep the target mob rooted - then only your pet will charge you.  Before the
mob(s) are in range start firing your low-level, fast-casting stun.  They'll
run into it and lock down for 2 seconds.  DONT MOVE AWAY, just fire your
best stun as soon as the gems reset - that will lock down the mobs for 6 or
8 seconds (depending on which stun you have) which gives you time to
re-charm, hit your 'swap target' hotkey, hit your 'pet attack' hotkey and
back away.  Once you have the timing down, you can do this without getting
hit.

Always keep a rune up when charm fighting.  It's more than worth the cost of
the gem.  If you're too cheap to spend money on gems, keep the Berserker
Spirit line up on yourself.

Here's how charm works; when you charm a mob, a resist check is made on save
vs. magic, with a factor of your current charisma as a modifier on the
resist check.  Testing has shown that an enchanter with a charisma of 75 has
seventeen percent more resists on charm than an enchanter with a charisma of
150 - but that's a pretty big gap.  Every tick after the inital charm, the
mob gets to check against magic again to see if it breaks charm.  Thus, tash
and malo* are huge factors in keeping a pet charmed for any length of time,
as is keeping your charisma *at least* above 115.

Keeping your charmed mob ensnared, also known as keeping it 'leashed' is a
very good idea.  When soloing, you can stay as far from the mob as pathing
allows, but in a group you're usually going to be much, much closer.  The
slower your charmed mob moves, the closer you can be when charm breaks to
move away and recharm.  Investment in Jboots, Tboots, SoW potions, and
friendship with beastlords/shamans/druids/rangers is also advisable.

I never use charm in a CC situation except for in emergency (i.e. charming
an add and using it to offtank another add).  Too risky.

I've had some killer groups in HoH basement with a mage and a ranger.
Ranger shot, pulled, and took care of snares; mage DS'd my charmed mob and
sent in his water pet to backstab (with taunt off); I did what chanters do
best.  :)  We kept two rooms cleared and part of the third.  Our biggest
problem was the inability to heal my pet - a cleric, druid, or shaman would
have been ideal additions.

I didn't snip the above because I inserted comments into it; if you missed
'em go back up and scan for them.

My charm lineup for soloing is:
Tash
Rune
Color 1
Color 2
Root
Charm
Mezz
Gate
I will swap Root and Slow as needed - show me an enchanter who has enough
buffslots!
In a group, the lineup is the same except Gate is replaced with Boggle and
Root is replaced with Slow.
