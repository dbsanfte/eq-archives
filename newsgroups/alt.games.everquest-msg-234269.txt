As I understand it, you create an account and can use it free for a
month. If you cancel your account before the end of the month, you
don't get billed. If you cancel your account before the end of the
month, you can carry on using it until the end of the month.

Yes it will get billed, unless you cancel it. Setting up an account
requires giving yor credit card details.

There is no trial version as such. You create a real account on a real
server (there are 40-ish to choose from) and if you start paying the
subscription you carry on with the same account. So, yes, you can
continue playing the same character(s).

> 4. Will I have access to everything on basic EQ?

Yes. All you will miss is the content added in the various expansions.
(Be warned - that is a LOT of content, but there is enough in basic EQ
to tell you if you like it or not).
