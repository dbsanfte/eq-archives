And *that* is why there is a large portion of MMOG players, across all
games, who do not consider quests a necessary part of the game.

As odd as it sounds even to me, Ever"Quest" just isn't a quest-based game,
in either incarnation.  A lot of people didn't care for WoW's questing
system and the "hand holding" it provided, but in my opinion it's probably
the best quest system so far for a MMOG simply due to the fact that it is
considered an integral and necessary part of the game where you are actively
slowing down your progression by not doing quests, rather than slowing down
your progression by doing them.
