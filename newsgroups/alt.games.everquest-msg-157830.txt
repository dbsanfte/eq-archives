Totally baffling. 

First, to have the opinion that on your very first raid or two where you
are an invited guest and under observation, that you are equally
entitled to loot as much as people who have been there building the raid
force, developing the tactics, fighting and dying (usually for no loot
and negative xp).  

Second, to have the opinion that two weeks of trial period (where
granted, you get no loot) is an unreasonable time to get into a raiding
force where you can hit serious targets and eventually get gear you'd
never get without a raid force. I guess they should just guild anyone on
the server, no questions asked?

Third, to then come here and brag about it and try to justify it.
