Depends on the bank, I suppose. Recently, someone got hold of my boyfriend's
debit card number, charged about $800 worth of phone sex charges to our checking
account (just in time for the first of the month, rent was due....fun, fun, fun)

We immediately cancelled both cards on the account, and opened a brand new
account. Opened a claim with our bank, they provisionally credited the account
back, and fewer than 3 months later, the credits became permanent. Their
investigation showed that the charges were not made by either of us, so our
claim was approved. Including all of the NSF fees that were charged due to the
fraudulent charges.

Perhaps we're an exception to the rule.
