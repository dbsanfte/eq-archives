    To get a monk where they got one, they had to physically push him
through the roof. A roof is a solid object (or it's supposed to be,
anyways). Call me crazy, but I think that LoS knew that pushing someone
through a solid object to get to the other side wasn't kosher. And since
I've seen LoS members complain about "clipping problems" in further posts,
I'm now convinced this is what happened.

    That line of reasoning is similar to saying "any tactic that gets
changed in the future was an exploit". Hopefully you can see the flaw in
that. A good example would be LoS's kill on the AoW with charmed giants. The
giants that were used were made uncharmable, but nobody in LoS was suspended
or banned for exploiting. Verant simply decided that they didn't want charm
to work that way in that area. Ditto Mind Wrack - they didn't like the idea
of two necromancers being able to generate 600 mana per minute for their
group without a casting mob in the area.

    We never did the duel Wrack thing for Emperor - it was changed long
before we completed the encounter.

    Silly monk - the green-con lizard slaves make much better Wrack targets.
;-) But again - I dispute calling it an exploit, simply because we had at
least one GM watching our entire first Emperor kill. He knew what we were
doing, and he didn't suspend or ban anyone. They changed how the spell
works, because they didn't want Mind Wrack to be available during that
encounter, but they didn't say "doing this violates the rules of EQ."

    Oh, as an aside - the reason the GM was there was because a few people
had backed up too far against the wall and had fallen through the wall and
out of the room when someone accidentally aggroed the center mobs. The GM
came, ressed these people, and brought them up to the room (traps were
already tripped). He asked if the necromancers had fallen as well or if
they'd left to summon corpses. So we told him why they weren't there. =)
It's a good rule to follow - be open with the GMs, and they'll respect you
and treat you fairly. Try to hide what you're doing, and you just make
yourself look guilty.

> Do you really think LoH deserved the banning/s?

    Suspensions, and yes. They pushed people through a solid object on
purpose to facilitate their pull. It's not like it happened by accident,
they pulled VXAHR down on themselves unintentionally, but managed to win.
They wiped on the first try, ressed, and were about to win on the second
try. They knew exactly what they were doing.

    If what we'd done was an exploit, sure. ;-) What we did was cheesy, but
not an exploit. How do we draw the line? We didn't have to - the GM did.

> Its not like theres an official mob pull guide, to know whats legit and
> whats not..

    I'm not against the actual pull. If they left a monk camped in that
room, and managed to do the pull that way, I wouldn't have a problem with
it. Verant might - I don't know. But I wouldn't.

    What I do have a problem with is warping someone through a solid object
on purpose to make such a pull possible. We could warp our entire raid
through that roof using spined weapons, if we wanted. But there's no way
we'd do it, because we know you don't try and camp through walls, or warp
over them, or try and bypass them without a travel spell like CotH.

    You're missing out. They're more than just batteries.
