(if that IS his real name) disgorged:

>Get a hub. Connect each PC to the hub.  Connect the cable modem to the hub.
>Voila.  2 Internet connections from one.
>
>Just don't expect your ISP to help you out if you run into problems.  Most
>ISP's only support one pc connected to one Internet connection.
