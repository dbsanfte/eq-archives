Needing information for quick exp for diffrent lvls. With my chanter I was
doing the Tripp quest in PoK but due to Birthing of my new baby, I have not
played in a while. I see they have nerfed it. Any suggestions on quest like
that one (35 -50)?  Also looking for lower lvl ones(20-35).
Thanks for the help.

Linda
