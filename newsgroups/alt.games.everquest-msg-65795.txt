Patching the rest took me something like half an hour *shock*
And the game actually ran when I got in. No black spots or anything
other than a very slight choppy look when I breathe etc, which I
expect is because of the no-Glide thing. Zoned like a slug, though.

Not a fan of the human Kerrans, but they won't exactly kill me. The
highest Vah Shir were level 16, 17 and 18 beastlords, all in the same
semiuberguild.
