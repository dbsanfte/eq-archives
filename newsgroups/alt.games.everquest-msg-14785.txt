 Sarnak Fort doesn't really start dying up until 31. Personally I
despised Highkeep and only spent one session there before moving
elsewhere as my Druid.

 What I liked about it at the time (it has since gotten busier and
regularly sees 100+ there on my server) was that the mobs were constant
and the xp was good. You didn't have to get on a "waiting list" or
whatever, just set yourself up and start pulling some sarnaks until you
had enough for the day.
