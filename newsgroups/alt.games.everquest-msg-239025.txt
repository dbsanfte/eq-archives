20% less spell damage and minus 300 ATK is a significant DPS loss (and i
assume the ATK debuff will also prevent avatar, ferocity, SoP and so on from
being usable.. another few hundred ATK loss, again even more dps)

I also figure most people aren't way over cap in STA and AGI.. although only
one of them really matters, the other was hard to raise in potime gear..
most people hover around the agi cap it seems
