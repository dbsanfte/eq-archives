If you choose The Tribunal:

Barbarian Cultural
Artificers Ringmail
BAR; SHM, ROG; Tribunal only, recommended level 45, weight 3.0, size large,
magic
veil AC 10, WIS 5, mana 30, HP 30
neckguard AC 11, WIS 5, AGI 5, HP 25, mana 25
bracer AC 12, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30, 5 to all saves
gloves AC 12, DEX 5, WIS 5, HP 25, mana 25
cape AC 14, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40
mantle AC 15, WIS 5, DEX 5, HP 30, mana 30
skirt AC 15, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40
boots AC 16, DEX 5, HP 30, mana 30
sleeves AC 16, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30
coif AC 17, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30
leggings AC 22, STR 10, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40
ringmail (tunic) AC 30,STA 5, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40

If you choose Bristlebane there does not appear to be imbued armor that a
barbarian can wear.  Dwarves make the Bristlebane armor, and it does not fit
on Barbarians.

If you choose Agnostic (or Bristlebane):

Human Cultural
Fine Seafarer's Armor
RNG, ROG, SHM; HUM, BAR, HEF, recommended level 45, wt 3.0 on all pieces,
size large
veil AC 10, HP 30, mana 30
neckguard AC 11, AGI 5, HP 25, mana 25
bracer AC 12, HP 30, mana 30, all saves +5
gloves AC 12, DEX 5, HP 25, mana 25
cloak AC 14, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40
mantle AC 15, DEX 5, HP 30, mana 30
skirt AC 15, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40
sleeves AC 16, 30 mana, 30 HP
coif AC 17, INT 5, 30 mana, 30 HP
leggings AC 22, HP 40, mana 40
tunic AC 30, STA 5, HP 40, mana 40


There are some other options for armor, but these are the two best ones
available to a Barbarian Rogue.

Looking it over, unless you want the Wisdom component, you would be fine
remaining Agnostic as a barbarian rogue.
