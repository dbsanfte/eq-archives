level 3 Jaxon's Jig o' vigor, you dont need sta, until level 12 you don't
have to twist 3 songs, so just use it and you will have no more sta
problems, at 12 when you get bellow you wont be worrying about getting
winded in a fight, you will be a  kighting machine.  Just depends on your
endurance.  I have yet to find anything that I can't kite to death,
sometimes it takes a few minutes but  once you start chant kiting, mobs drop
pretty fast.
