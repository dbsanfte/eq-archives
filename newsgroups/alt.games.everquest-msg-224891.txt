Way back in my character's teens, I spent a bunch of time at South Tower in
Everfrost.  There were usually 8 to 10 people there.  None of us were
grouped.  We'd individually go out, grab something (orc, leopard, whatever)
and fight it.  If someone got in trouble, whoever was free would usually
jump in and help.  There were very few instances of killstealing, and people
rarely died.  Cooperation yes, even when soloing.
