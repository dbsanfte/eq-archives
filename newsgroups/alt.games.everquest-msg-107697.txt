Only good thing I can say about al-kabor, is that they have a pretty
large area of effect. So those 5 mobs don't all have to be stacked on
top of each other to get hit. Other than that, they are kinda sucky.
They don't seem to have good efficiency compared to the column type
spells. Some higher level al-kabors get a little more interesting when
they have a 0 second stun effect which will interrupt casters.

The rain spells are also kinda lame. They come in a max of 3 waves of
damage, with a chance for the mob to resist each wave. They don't hit
multiple targets in the way one would expect, i.e. all targets in the
rain area getting hit with each wave. Instead there is some kind of
arbitary limit on the number of damage waves you will get out of the
rain spell, regardless of the number of potential targets. The most
waves of damage I've seen is 4. 2 waves on 2 mobs.

That said, some of the 50+ rains get kind of interesting for use in
group situations. I think it's tears of druzzil that has the potential
to get nice mana efficiency on one target, potentially exceeding the
efficiency of any straight single target nukes at that level. I think
it can do around 1800 HP for 300 mana. The problem with rains is that
the target has to stay in one place over time for the rain to be
effective, which makes them pretty useless for kiting.

I'm afraid you may need to wait until 34 when you get circle of force
before you can really start solo quadding like a pro. CoF hits up to 4
mobs for around 270 hp each, at a cost of 170 mana. I know my wiz
couldn't really solo quad until I got that spell. It's a research only
spell, so start shopping them runes now!
