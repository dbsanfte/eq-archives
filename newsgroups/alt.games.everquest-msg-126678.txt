Kami (or sometimes "gami," as when used as the second kanji in a word) -
Divine, or spirit, as in Kami-sama (the Christian God), or Megami (Goddess)

Kaze - Wind.... Kazegami could be taken as a wind god... please don't make
me post reference numbers to the kanji enteries in Nelson's Kanji
Dictionary.

That doesn't show that reversing the order of the kanji would make the
compound I suggested.

None the less, they have been brainwashed.  Anyways, it's amazing what you
will believe when you haven't been allowed to know anything different.  They
haven't been taught western notions of reason and logic.  There is no
socratic method in their education.  Can you blame them for believing the
only thing they can hear?

So, I didn't go look it up.  Sue me.

Ah, so it's a long established fact... one of those things that "everybody
knows."  The common muslim is not stupid, just -thoroughly- indoctrinated,
and not allowed access to the truth.
