Actually, from what I've heard/read, Cazic isn't KOS to Iksar -- because 
they're his special children and they *all* worship him, or something.  I 
think he even, by default, views Iksar kindly.

Of course... the rest of the zone hates you...

By the way, there's a guide for the Shackle of Tynn and the Whistling Fists 
at http://www.geocities.com/Kurrleeeci/ShackleGuideText.html.  =)
