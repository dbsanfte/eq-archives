    The XP is good if you do non-standard stuff, like AoE. The drops vary as
to quality. The acrylia off the underbulk-model mobs sells well in The
Bazaar, and a lot of the vendor trash drops are stackable, but there's also
too many junky drops for the quest to find out about the hidden bridge.
Those should be toned back a bit.

    Since all the zone really offers now is XP, it's hard to make it
attractive compared to PoP. It needs item drops if it wants to draw folks.

    How could a zone revamp change that, though? I'm trying to think of what
they could change to make the zone more attractive, and location isn't going
to change.

    And don't forget the seahorse spine belt, again off a one-groupable
named. Are the adds due to z-axis issues, bad pathing, spawn density, what?

    If they opened up the locked door leading out, would leaving still be an
issue? I've never fought here because of the name of the faction hit.

    Is it much worse than Sebilis? Just trying to get some idea how bad it
is.
