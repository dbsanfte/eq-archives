Are Barbarians non-KOS on Kerra Isle? I'm pretty sure they are, so run over
there to the Inn on the beach. Kill "wharf rat" (sometimes spawning as "Fang
Tooth") INSIDE the Inn every 20 minutes. Give his tooth to the Kerran on the
dock to your right as you exit the Inn for big exp, faction and a crappy Lore
necklace. This is great experience until level 24 or so, but zero loot.

There are two rats outside on the beach but they don't drop anything. While
waiting for Fang Tooth to respawn you can kill them for exp, or go over to the
ramp that leads down to the beach from zone-in and root-rot single Kerrans
(watch for one wanderer).

Kerra has a huge zone bonus and you'll probably have it all to yourself.
