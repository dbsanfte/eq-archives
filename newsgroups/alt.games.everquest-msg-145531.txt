Ditto warriors and monks, as well as paladins and SK's for
the most part.  Rangers >30 are cursed with SoW and also
have some damage shields, and still get bugged by the d00ds
that "need" SoW to level...

At the same time I believe I'm on record from 3 years ago asking
for occasional special loot to drop...loot that is in a locked case
that can only be picked by a bard (sometimes, low skill) or a rogue.
It would make a lot more sense to have an Ancient spell drop in
a locked spellbook that you wouldn't want to risk giving to a level
20 twink, but would to your level 60 friend with 210 skill and
mechanical lockpicks.  Your higher level friend has a much lower
chance of setting off the AoE deathtouch than the bard....;-)

I think that several of these would be level appropriate, such as
gems dropping from the bandits in Paludal (they ARE underground)
and dwarves in Crystal Caverns occasionally being dropped in a
locked chest with some coin and interesting stuff ("wow...Khalshazar
came out of Fippy Darkpaw's secret stash!!!").  It just makes for
a bit more interesting game, and it gives bards and rogues something
class-related that doesn't deal directly with combat combat combat.

While I do agree somewhat, I do think that this would cause a
bit of whining by other classes.  Unless the gear was rogue
specific, or could ONLY be gotten by pickpocket and was nodrop,
this could lead to folks bitching until a loot-type message about
what was pickpocketed was implemented.  "He might pp a fungus
patch vest!!!"   Back when we started doing Air, I'd pickpocketed
enough gems to pay for coffins on our first wipeout.  For the whole
raid.  And it didn't matter, because it was a guild raid and it was
all going to guild coffers anyways.  But I'll have to admit that even
I might be close-mouthed on a non-guild raid if I "found" a Fungi or
a Flayed Barbarian Mask...
