FYI. I got a SB Live! OEM and Inspire 5.1 speaker system for Christmas
and hooked them up last evening. At first I got sound only during the
log in process (background music), but during the game I got only
certain sounds. Magic effects produced no sound at all.

I downloaded the latest SB Live! drivers from
http://www.soundblaster.com and it works very well now.  The sound is
much more realistic than before.  My only complaint is that the sound
of taking things and putting them back in the inventory window is a
bit too loud compared to other sounds, but that may be a config issue
in-game.

HTH.
