You could try the United Kingdoms guild, we are a rapidly expanding guild
covering levels 1 to 60, lots of players at all levels. We like to pass
items down through the ranks in guild, and we have raids on various level
areas (Misstmoore and Dalnir this past weekend). Xavron is our guild leader,
or you could ask for an officer next time you are online.
