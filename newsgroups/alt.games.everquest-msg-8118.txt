That level is 25. From there on up, blue cons give the same message.

I'm curious as to their rationale behind this. The blue con range 
increases markedly as you level up, thus making 'different shades 
of blue' make even more sense at the higher levels.

It just makes no sense that upon leveling from 24 to 25,
a character suddenly loses the ability to distinguish a
dangerous blue mob from a less risky blue mob.
