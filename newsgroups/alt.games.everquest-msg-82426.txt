Hello,
I just bought Radeon8500 for EQ )
I am using it on W2k and my EQ client shut down for no reason.
I also know this happnes to all who uses w2k.
However, mine dies so often that as every 5 minuts or so.
Since my wife's pc does only 1 or so for 12 hours or something.

I guess this got be something with Radoen's driver.
I'd like to know if there is any knows issue about this and any solution
has announced.
Thanks.
