Well, I would have wifey kill off the mage (or just make a new character ;) 
and throw in a Warrior. The druid you have is awesome with a warrior, as 
you can heal, snare, port and buff. One nice thing I have noted is that you 
can buff a tank up good, med med med, tank pulls to your spot... When he 
announces an incoming chunk of flesh for the grinder, stand and cast a DS 
on your tank, then a snare on the mob, and a DOT if you are above 70 mana 
or so. Then, sit and med until after the fight, and heal your tank.

Enchanter and Mage works well too, IME... Two pets (Chanter and a Water). 
Chanter hastes both pets, then pulls with Tash. The water pets spells beat 
much more ass with a tash, and he should have no problem holding aggro. 
Then you guys med through and toss the occasional nuke.
