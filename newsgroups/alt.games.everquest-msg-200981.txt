Here, let me help you... (Remember, correct punctuation is your friend.)

Hello, Everyone! I have been up every one of the last few evenings trying to
come up with a way to scam you out of your hard-earned money.  I believe
that I have achieved this goal.

First, I will let you know that it is all FREE!  Yes, I know.  It really
will cost you, but I have to apply the correct tease.  Then, I will babble
on about many of the free things you can do (but, I will never reveal the
true costs as that would blow the plan to smithereens).

Last, I will give you the secret site (which will soon be yanked, as I am a
spamming fool).

And, of course, I will sign off with an anonymous, ROb.
