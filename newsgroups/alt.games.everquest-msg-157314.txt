You're missing the point. If you want to level past 50, buy Kunark. You 
want to play a Beastlord or use the Bazaar, buy Luclin. You want to go 
to Velious, buy Velious. You want to go to the plane of knowledge, buy PoP.

However, if you don't buy Kunark you can still do the things in the old 
world you always could.

If you don't buy Velious you can't go to Velious, nothings changed.

If you don't buy Luclin, you can't go to Luclin or create a Beastlord 
etc, nothing's changed.

If you don't buy PoP, you WILL be prevented on participating on raids 
ANYWHERE, not just raids inside the PoP. Once enough people have PoP, 
using the new raiding system will become a *requirement* for attendance.

Therefore, not owning PoP will have negative effects on what you used to 
do in the world before PoP. You will eventually HAVE to buy PoP if you 
want to continue attending raids.
