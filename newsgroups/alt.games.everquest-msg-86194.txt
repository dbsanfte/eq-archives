No, no security danger, they did share accounts. However, there are 
games where sharing login name and password does not give the entire 
account to another person. It just allows them to log in and play

No, the owners were not very smart, they made a fairly stupid mistake. 
However, if I make a stupid mistake and leave my house door unlocked, it 
still does not give someone any right to walk in and take whatever they 
want.
Moreso, if I give my friend keys to my house so he can crash over for a 
night, and he ends up selling my stereo and computer and burning the 
house down, he will be in for some difficult times. Especially if he 
calls me afterwards and laughs about it.

When you get an oil change for your car, you give your car keys to a 
mechanic. Are you basically saying to him "fine, destroy my car or sell 
it or keep it for yourself"?
