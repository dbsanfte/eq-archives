Kodiac's Endless Intellect.  A spell only level 60+ chanters can cast that
gives you 18 points of mana regeneration per tick.  (one tick = six seconds)

I still remember the first time this was cast on me.  My jaw dropped at how
quickly my mana was replenished.  It was like having a mana faucet!  By now
I've become slightly jaded and only consider myself *truly* buffed if I have
KEI and Blessed Armor of the Risen *and* Spiritual Purity going at the same
time, which gives me thirty points per tick altogether.

KEI has turned into a huge money-maker for chanters.  I see people routinely
buy a casting of KEI for 100pp, no matter what level they are.  I've heard
stories of chanters making 3K an hour sitting in the Nexus selling KEI.
Since KEI lasts over two hours, it's a good investment for a soloist.

KEI also gives a big boost to your INT and WIS.  I buy KEI when I'm smithing
so I can get my WIS pegged at 255, which helps with skill-ups.
