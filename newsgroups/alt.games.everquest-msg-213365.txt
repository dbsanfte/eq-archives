Thanks, DT.

But...this system had no software installed between 25 and 29-August.  It is not infected
with any virus or spyware.

This system a Pentium IV 2.4GHz system, on an Abit BE7-RAID, 1024MB PC2700, 2x 80MB 8MB
cache RAID-0 drives, GeForce 4600 TI, Audigy.  Normal frame-rates in, say, PoK, at the
bank, on a crowded night, stay well above 40FPS.  I use a tool named FRAPS for in-game
monitoring of frame rates.

My connection is a most definitely un-laggy residential DSL line.  I've tested it
thoroughly, no issues there.

I played on 25-August with no problems, other than those inherent in soloing the Lady D.
with a non-KEI 50 Paladin.  But I digress...  ;->

The next time I logged in, on 29-August, I could not play because of the tanked frame
rates.

Smells suspicious, like a troll in Qeynos.

/shouts in PoK and /chat in The Rathe's server-wide auction channel met with replies from
a couple of other individuals experiencing the same problem.

/shrug

Can't play until it's fixed.  I'll check daily for emergency patches, but because of the
holiday I don't expect to see anything until Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.
