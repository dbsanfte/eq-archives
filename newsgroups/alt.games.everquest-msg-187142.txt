I've never put this to the test, but I've heard that Sanctus hates the
evil races but doesn't care about evil religion, while Katta hates
evil religion but doesn't care about evil races. So an agnostic dark
elf rogue would be okay in Katta but dead in Sanctus, while a innoruuk
worhipping human would be okay in Sanctus but dead in Katta.

Like I said, though, I've never tested that, and in both cities there
are people who just plain hate other people.
