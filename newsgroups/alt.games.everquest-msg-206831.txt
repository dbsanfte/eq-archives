I've trained swimming in Halas pretty effectively.

Swim across the lake towards Halas dock, park yourself in the corner between
the pier for the dock and the land - looking all the way up... you can swim
and swim safely... no fish.  I usually do it while reading a book, or
whatever, at my desk, and I've never noticed my stamina dropping or had
sinking issues...

Maybe I just haven't done it long enough...
