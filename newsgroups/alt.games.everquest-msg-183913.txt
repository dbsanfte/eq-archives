    Yeah I heard that 100pp was the standard donation at one point. I began
by donating 10pp, bearing in mind I was a mid-40's tank not a druid or
someone expected to make a bucket out of the cast. I donate 20pp these days
and soloing barely pays for that and the sow potions but is worth it for the
ludicrous (By comparison) exp :)

    I've only ever seen one chanter set a minimum donation and I've *never*
been turned down with 10 or 20 pp.

    I don't want to argue with anybody about the cost of KEI because we've
been over it. You and I probably haven't but it's basically market forces,
which do not exists in this newsgroup, and peoples opinions, that make up
the price. Every factor involved has been done to death previously so I
don't want a repeat.

    All things aside, I'd like to group with people who do everything they
can to max the group's exp input. That is to say, people who train their
skills, people who try other tactics to understand aspects of the game,
people who read up on their spells and their characters, people who solo at
least occasionally to see the other side of the coin, and yes, people who
turn up with uber buffs they invested money into. Its probably unreasonable
to expect people to do that. In fact, expecting intelligent behavior from
humans is basically unreasonable.

    On the other hand, I would definitely like to group with people who can
operate without these buffs and aren't dependant on them. I don't like the
idea of kei nerfing peoples learning curves but I think that can largely be
avoided if people train without it from time to time. These buffs do drop
eventually and running off for a refresh right away isn't always
appropriate, but maybe taking time off of using them altogether to stay in
touch with one's unbuffed character is wise too. Certainly there's a good
argument to support that.

    I think of it as a high standard. I guess I don't really expect it, I
mean, if I'm being realistic I'm expecting at least one person of the 5
others grouping with me is a complete git (for example, not suggesting
anyone turning up without kei is a complete git). Hell for all I know it's
an even chance one of the group members bought his character yesterday and
has no idea what his spells do yet. But I've been in some groups that I
thought were lethal, and not because of twinked characters (although they
have a tendancy to be played by people who know their stuff) but because the
people who turned up were dedicated, knew their business, communicated well
and acted like a team. Buffs help such people a lot, but don't seem to
enhance idiots too much. I think if someone's got KEI or not, if they're a
dork it will shine through. If they know their crap, that will shine through
also no matter how little or much mana they have, but all things being
equal, KEI is the bomb.

    When I think about it, if the wizzy I normally group with asked me for
100pp so he could get kei before we grouped, I'd hand it over. I don't even
know if he's an especially briliant wizard, but he is an absolute artillery
piece in combat. The combination of fear and ice comets just blows me away
every time. Along with whatever the hell is stupid enough to take us on :)

    And they're benefiting from mine and the utility value of the extra
spells I wouldn't otherwise cast. Maybe we should be giving each other cash
but that doesn't make too much sense to me. The best way I'd like to reward
a caster for turning up with c3 is by turning up with c3 and/or aego myself,
and rewarding them with more experience from our combined efforts :)

> Anyway, I'm not claiming that *only* casters should be compensated for C3.

    Well there's a lot of logic that says hybrids achieve less with their
mana. I'd probably agree with that, my pre 49 spells mostly fell into the
"annoy monster" category. But I think if you turn up to a group and you're
the only guy with c3, wanting compensation of some sort might make sense,
whereas if you turn up to a group and *Everybody* has it (perhaps not the
warrior and the rogue <g>) then you WILL be compensated - mobs drop faster,
so more loot and more experience rolls in. I guess that was my original
point and I phrased it very badly, causing this god-awful thread ;/

    Yeah I'd like to stress I've never been actively critical of anyone who
didn't have kei. In fact the only things I've verbally criticised people
i've grouped with for have been dangerous behavior (deciding to pull your
own mob while the puller was on their way back with two is a shining
example) or being an asshole. (one guy was actually drunk I found out the
next day and couldn't remember swearing at group members for dissagreeing
with him)

    In most of the grouping I've done, people have been coming and going all
the time. Many people for reasons best left to them to explain seem to group
for half an hour at the time or less. I tend to stay for 2.5-3 hours and
find that a very reasonable contribution to a group. In fact I rarely see
others staying that long, so I think c3-length isn't hurting me in that way.
Your experiences seem to suggest a different thing, from what you are
writing.

    When the champion cleric who's been doing their job excellently for 2
hours of grouping stands up and says "I'm going to go and renew c3" I
certainly don't complain. If he asked for help donating my hand would be in
my pocket. I usually offer to fear kite for the group while he's gone, which
many people try for 2 kills then get sick of. (for some reason melees seem
to hate chasing after mobs)

    Yes when grouping my actual casting frequency is multiplied by something
hideous. I don't know the standing mana regen of a 51SK but 14 per tick is
several times it, and that's the ratio. Even still I have far less mana than
a caster because they med while I fight and pull, and my mana does less
because it's hybrid magic, but the effect on my casting is huge from my
standpoint.

    Aego and virtue are similar to KEI but don't have the same effect. If
there was a hitpoint regen spell that pulled 14hp/tick and lasted 2.5 hours
that would be closer to the equivalent. People pay lord knows what for a
breastplate that regens 15hp/tick because of its enormous value.

    But even that might not achieve it. A melee who can't heal themself (kei
for a pally is extremely effective for tank/heal soloing) regenning
14hp/tick isn't going to do nearly as well as a caster with that much extra
mana regen because mobs rip a lot more than 14 hitpoints every 6 seconds out
of you when you tank them. The higher up you get the more ludicrously out of
proportion this seems to go :)

    Aego and virtue are wonderful buffs, but unless you are grouping with a
cleric they dont really come into their own. Without a cleric their main
advantage is the extra AC, with the smaller advantage that more hitpoints
gives you a slightly better safety margin. Without a cleric, really only the
extra AC can be converted into more experience income for the group. (using
any tactics that I can think of :) (actually maybe being puller for a swarm
AOEing group with no cleric could make a lot of use of it but thats a rare
group)

    Well as it turns out I shouldn't have been putting that argument forth
so strenuously as I had the wrong haste spell in mind when I came to my
conclusions. I still think the fastest haste and *Whatever* mana measures
required is the superior strategy, but asking a 20's enchanter to get KEI so
he can splurt ludicrous amounts of mana into an overpriced spell for a few
extra dps for the group is a very silly position to take and one I
definitely regret putting forward as it has made me look quite the tosser.
In my 20's I only recall a few instances where I encountered people with
KEI, and certainly never thought about anyone in the group getting it for
any purpose. On the other hand I spent *all* of my 20's in high keep waiting
for spawns that we had completely locked down, usually with no mana regen or
haste at all.
