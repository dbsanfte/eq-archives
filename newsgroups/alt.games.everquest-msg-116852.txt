Yes. It seems rational to me to try work things out rather than take the 
easy way out and kill yourself. I think this seems rational to most 
people except for those who stand to benefit from this law suit.

How so? Unless you have some sort of terminal illness or disability, you 
can work through your problems before resorting to ending it all.

Yes it is, which is my point. You agree with me then?

If EQ really *is* at fault (which I highly doubt), then Sony should 
still not be liable because this kid had options, but *chose* to kill 
himself out of his own free will rather than try to resolve his 
problems. Its his own responsibiliy. His mother should learn to deal 
with it and stop looking for a way to profit out of it.

No. Governments should limit what you can and can't sue for, and how 
much money can be awarded in damages. Only if a company is directly and 
100% responsible for somebody dying should they be made to pay damages 
(eg food poisoning as a result of a lack of hygiene in a restaurant). 
Otherwise people abuse this as much as they can, as we can see from this 
case.
