I read somewhere that the way to do this is to team up with someone who knows
the language you want to learn. You send them tells in your language, and they
send you tells in theirs. You can raise the other persons language skill to 1
past yours, but it doesn't show up in the skills until you zone. Thet trick
apparently is to stand at a zone boundary and hotkey some text. Hammer away at
the hotkey for a few seconds. (Make sure its /tell and not public chat) and
cross the zone boundary. Rinse and repeat.

This is as far as I know, hearsay, and may or may not work.

Cheers

John
