Personally... I use AE STun/tash/AE Stun/mez for OMFG TRAIN! situations. AE
mez can be just as usefull honestly...

just depends on situation...

if you ae stun and stun yourself all ya have to remember is that if there is
a resist most likely they coming after you... if not then they all asleep
and you don't have to worry about the adds (They sleeping remember) Problem
is I think AE Stun only works on a max number of critters... 4-5 iirc... so
it there are more and they get thru while youmez yerself that is what we
call 'trouble' hehe

which is why I prefer AE Stun/Mez... also ALOT easier to spread mobs out
like that...

AE Stun
Mez
AE Stun
Back up and start casting mez
Mob comes after you when stun breaks and is promptly mezzed

when stun breaks on rest, mez hits when he comes after you thus seperating
the mobs... makes it less confusing imho

my 2c... enchanter spells are all about how you use them... almost every
enchanter spell can be usefull... when used properly... some have less
applications than others but each spell has it's use... what makes a good
chanter good is knowing when to use what etc...

don't mind my ramble... tired... no caffiene... and I tend to talk to much
when I'm like this so... peace... phat lewt... and god speed
