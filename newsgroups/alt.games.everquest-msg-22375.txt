Both UO and Asheron's Call  have non-pk.  In UO you can choose to play in
Felucca or Trammel, one you can be pk'd in and the other you can't.  Lol,
forgot which is which, but the one you can be pk'd in is the one where
everything looks dead (landscape wise).  I only play on the non-pk side
although I used to play on the other as a non-pk player. Lol I have enough
problems killing beasties without having to watch out for people trying to
kill me when the mob has worn me down to a fine red line of health.

In Asherons Call, there is one server that is pk...but you can choose to be
pk on any server, you just can't attack a non-pk player, like here in
Everquest.  My hunting partner in AC is going red when he is higher level
because he likes the challenge...his higher level char is already red, even
though we play on Thistledown which is not a pk server.  I wouldn't
reccomend Dark Tide, unless you are really into pk...I have friends there
and made a char.  Unfortunately I found out there are a lot of newbie
stalkers on that server, so now I just play on TD or Solclaim.

Then you can also play DiabloII in non pk mode, if you do like I do--set up
private games :)
