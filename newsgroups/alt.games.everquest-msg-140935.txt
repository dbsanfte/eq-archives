As I progress in levels with my paper thin, dress wearing caster, I'm
finally getting up to where I'm fighting the same shit my Myrmidon used
to tank.  And I'm seeing some weirdness in certain areas, and hearing
some conflicting reports about the subject issue.

Supposedly, to take on example, you are virtually unable to cast on
Faydedar unless you are standing within melee range. I've heard the same
said about Ragefire and Talendor. Somebody else said that about a couple
named Giants.

Is there any hard truth to be had about this? Are there cases where the
nukers have to get inside the melee box to successfully land a nuke? And
if so, which mobs? Is it just any mob above level 55? Any Giant or
Dragon class of those levels? Just certain named mobs? Total bullshit?

Anyone? Anyone? Beular?

taking up tailoring, get a ball peen hammer and whack yourself on the
head every 15 minutes. Over all, it's certainly less painful, and very
probably more productive."
