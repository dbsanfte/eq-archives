Other than a few mobs in the game who put a curse on you that reduces healing,
this will have practically no effect at all.  Sure, really high level characters

now have over 7500 hp... but cheals aren't timed to hit as you get down
to your last 100 hp.  Very few Cheals even on people with 8000+ hp totals
land for over 7500 hp now.  On average, even at 60th level with level 60
warrior tanks, most of my Cheals hit for 5000 to 6000 hp.

10000 hp versus 7500 hp will matter for some POP people who get their hp
totals up higher than anyone ever has in the past, but few indeed of them
will be able to say "remember when Cheal used to hit for more?" with a straight
face.

I agree here, the mod rod change is a massive massive nerf; they are
hitting it every which way; mod rods not droppable, and not usuable
more than one per minute, and not nearly as effective as before.  Since
much of the content is currently tuned for mod rods, the game at
the high (not even uber, just high) end is about to change radically, and
their promise of retuning just isn't promising, we are talking about
hundreds of mobs.

Balanced?  At levels under 50, monks are without a doubt the premier
tank class, doing more damage, taking less damage.  Warriors only take
over when their HP totals get so high that Cheal becomes an efficient
approach.... prior to that , what would you rather heal, someone with
1000 hp who takes 250 hp a minute, or someone with 2000 hp who
takes 500 hp a minute?  I'll give you two chances, but the first one
doesn't count.

This is true, because each cleric is going to run out of mana, so instead
of "enough clerics to keep the MA healed" we are now looking at
"enough mana to keep the MA healed."  Each cleric has a set starting
amount of mana and a set maximum mana regen rate.  More clerics
mean a deeper pool and a multiplied mana regen rate.  Mages, instead
of an infinite supply of mana, just became one more part of the mana
regen chain, but one that doesn't scale up with more mages; each
cleric can only recieve one mod per minute regardless of how many
mages you have available.  Bards will be more desirable, as will
necromancers, both sadly now relegated to feeding mana duty.  So
two classes screwed out of useful play in order to free one class
from mana regen duty?  Nice work!

But prior to PoP, whats the usual heal this worthy has been getting?  I'll
be very surprised if its over that 7500 mark by much.

You forgot keeping YV up constantly.  YV is a 10 mana per tic regen that
stacks with all that other stuff you mentioned, although it does cost you 10
mana
every 6 tics, so its really only a net 50 mana per 6 tics.  Thats half what
you'd
get for sitting down, though.

You also forget that bards have two mana regen lines, one that stays up on
you all the time and isn't stackable, but the other hits once per tic for
something like 9 more mana per... per bard you are grouped with.  Ideally
you will have 3 bards and 3 clerics in your group, I think (worked it out
once, but with mod rods it just didn't seem all that important) meaning
each cleric gets an extra 27 mana per tic out.

I've yet to be to a fight with sufficient mod rod support to waste on
wizards.  Clerics get put in a seperate area with the mages, and
casters don't come running over there to steal the precious commodity
thats keeping the MA alive and keeping the whole thing from bogging
down to a long "sit and wait" festival in between kills.  With modding,
I'm FM, the mage is FM, everyone is fully healed, and we are good
to go within a minute of mob death at worst.

I do see where this is going to multiply the number of damage
dealers needed, though.  We can't keep the MA alive indefinately,
now, so we need mobs to die faster.  Faster mob death means
we can operate within the mana pool instead of relying on
sufficient healing to keep the MA alive so long that a slower
kill is possible.  What this means for ring fights, though, where
mobs are replaced when killed, is hard to imagine.  Kill faster,
you get nowhere, since you just have to face more mobs!

I agree here, mod rod consumption is currently far higher than
one a minute, and thats the three charge version (taking out 900 hp)

Its very rare mid fight that I heal myself at all, thats the job of the
"other healers" who can afford the added aggro and who don't have
to worry as much about keeping the MA alive.  If I do, its probably
CE, not CHeal, because I simply don't have the 10 seconds to spare,
nor can I realistically expect to mod down to so far that a CHeal
is really efficient anyway.

Very very different.  Its not the "not droppable" part that will matter
the most, its the "one per minute" part and the "not nearly as good
a one anyway" parts that will be crippling.
