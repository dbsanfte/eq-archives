you can have up to 8 characters per (most) servers at any one time, the 
PVP ones and Firionia Vie server have diffirent rules about how many 
characters you can have.  No newbie has any business being on PVP 
servers or FV anyway, gotta learn how to play the game first before you 
are thrown to the wilds of PK'ers or have to deal with trivial loot code 
and not being able to talk to everyone.
