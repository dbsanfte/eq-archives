That would certainly describe our experiences. While on cable it was a
regular hourly even to see the meter go yellow...red....bye-bye! on
us,though sometimes it would recover fast enough.  With DSL that usually
meant that my connection was going DOWN and staying down for a bit. Which
happened rarely, I'm glad to report, since our past two ISPs have been
pretty good companies.
