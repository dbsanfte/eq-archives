I ended up going with crucial to get three of the 128 MB P133 sticks.
When I added in the shipping cost at pricewatch, it wasn't that much of
a savings, and as you pointed out, Crucial is giving free second day
fedex delivery currently. Plus, it was guaranteed to be 100% compatible
with my Gateway system, and I got scared of all the choices on
Pricewatch that I would order something inferior or incompatible.
