Just curious if there is a website somewhere that lists the various servers
and whether the sleeper is awake there?  I've heard the younger the server
the more likely he is still snoozing, and that would be my other question,
is there a site with Server History?  When it was created, if it is a split,
from where, etc?

I play a Monk on Ayonae Ro, and a Cleric on Terris-Thule.  Would like to
know about those specifically, but if there is a place to find out about all
the servers, that would be nice as well.  I imagine it would be a difficult
site to keep going, since this is information that could change in a moment,
but still.  Just thought I'd ask.  Thank you.
