Well, we got great news from H&R Block yesterday, and as a result the
hubby and I have decided to build another computer so we can actually
make use of the fact that we have 2 accounts and play together. =) This
is the first time we've ever tried to build one from scratch, although
we've replaced and upgraded every part in the last few we've had, so we
feel reasonably confident we can do this. Anyway, what would you guys
suggest (as far as brands of components and places to buy them),
assuming we want to keep the total price tag in the neighborhood of
$1000 or less and we want to end up with something that can handle
Luclin/Planes of Power with ease?

Mey
