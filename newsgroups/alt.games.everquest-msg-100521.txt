Yep. My cable bill where I am has gone up mid contract from $65AU dollars
per month to $90AU per month. At the same time the unlimited download quota
turned into 3gig a month, again, a change implemented mid contract...

My choice is wear it or use dial up in my area, so in comparison a $3US a
month rise effective at the start of a new billing period for the same
service as I had yesterday seems unnaturally polite.

Hmmn - seems like I have gotten so used to big companies chaining customers
over barrels and soddomising them with cheese graters that I now consider
them polite when they use fur lined manacles : )
