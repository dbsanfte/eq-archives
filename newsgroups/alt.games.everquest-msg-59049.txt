RvR is the main point of the game, the PvE contents runs out after
level 30 (out of 50 levels).  After 30 there are no more quests, the
highest level dungeons are un-itemized as are alot of high level mobs.
 There is a reliance on tradeskills for post 35 armor and weapons but
it takes an insane amount of time and money to reach those skills
(basically it requires a large guild throwing gobs of money at the
tradespeople).

The PvE content that is in the game is not very interesting. 
Basically you search around for an NPC(s) that gives quests for your
level, then do lots of traveling and kill a few mobs for special items
that you turn in for some experience/money/quest reward item.  Out of
the ~40 quests I've done until I reached to no-quest zone of post 30,
only two had somewhat interesting storylines.  Most of the rewards are
not worth the effort and some may not even be useable by your class.

Of the three realms, only Albion has had some thought put into it's
environment, the other two feel thrown together and are lacking in
details.

The actual RvR is lame.  It's either some high-level character that
can use stealth (meaning other players can't see you) picking off
lower level guys with archery.  Of course archery is over-powered, and
if initiated at a decent range can bring down a player in 2-3 shots. 
Or RvR is just two different groups colliding together and fighting
until one group runs aways.  Boring.

It was kinda fun for the free month, but not worth the monthly charge.
 Mediocre game at best.
