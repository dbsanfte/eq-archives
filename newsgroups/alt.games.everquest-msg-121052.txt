You will not evade me, jasonft@visi.com (Jason T):

Was kind of sickening to log in and find an extended range 3 item in
my fire gear, affliction efficiency 2 on another piece of fire gear,
and affliction efficiency 3 on my little mage's range slot item. (Said
item was promptly transferred to druid, but unfortunately I didn't do
any soloing last night. I'll go right back, as the crystal ball is now
a summoning haste 2 item...) Unlike my main, my alts were crawling in
stuff with effects, and it seems like leveling up to 49 has now become
quite depressing, given the availability of II items compared to the
availability of III items.

And while hopefully most of the ridiculous items have been corrected
(necro pet boost on testament of vanear? Heal boost on an int/cha
necklace?), even the fixes I have heard about sound screwed up. 
Turning the Shadel bandit ring into a II item is downright evil - it's
not THAT common, and it's far more useful at high levels than at the
mid levels where Verant seems to believe that ring is going; and I
heard that circlet of summer, a 10 wis 0 int item, has been changed
from spell haste 3 to summoning efficiency 3. Yeah, priests spend a
lot of mana casting pets...

Also a little bummed at the lists claiming my arisen cultist ring
should have extended enhancement, as it didn't last night (at least I
managed to get one before the mobs were removed).

And, how on earth am I going to get my hands on something that has
Improved Healing 3? *drool*

At least my Surefall druid is happy about the Surefall newbie quest I
just heard had been put in.
