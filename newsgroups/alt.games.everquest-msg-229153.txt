IMHO: You would be better off in PC in a group until you hit level 22. At 22
you get panic animal which will be your main leveling tool for the next 20
levels.

Safest spot would be The Arena entrance at Lake Rathe. There are two aviak
guards outside the entrance you can single pull and you should be able to
kill them fairly easily. Worse case is you pull them with snare, then root
them, then burn them a bit to soften them up before you melee. Probably
won't be necessary is you have anything other then your newbie stuff.

South Karana is OK. Don't take on 'the hermit' as he has been buffed. A bit
more dangerous trying to single pull aviaks and elephants. If you have a bow
and archery skill is up, you may want to practice [snare, run backwards
shooting] for a while. Watch out for adds.

At 22 buy your panic animal spell and you can snare and attack animals as
they flee, you don't take much damage.  Killing mamoths in Everfrost is
pretty common ranger fodder. You could still hunt South Karana and maybe
East Karana.

At 30 you get SoW. I would move to Stonebrunt if I could get a port. Running
through The Warrens is iffy since the kobold shamans can root. Stonebrunt
can take you all the way to 40.
