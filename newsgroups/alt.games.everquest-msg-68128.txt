Actually a bug they seem to refuse to fix (seemed to start occuring
just after they made it so you couldnt combine items that werent
recipies) allows you to put a whole stack in for a recipie and you
will combine but only get 1 of the item back as if you had only put
one in.  Example:

1 Batwing + 1 Frosting = 1 Batwing Crunchy

1 Batwing + 20 Frosting = 1 Batwing Crunchy

Or as I found out the hard way the other day:

3 Silk Swatches +
4 Heady Kiolas   +
1 Tunic Pattern   +
20 Vials of Viscous Mana = 

1 Failed attempt at a Wu's Tunic ... 1 very EXPENSIVE failure=)

Used to be that the above would give you a "Those items do not combine
in those quantities" message... now it just eats them and gives you a
single item or the failure depending on what the outcome would have
been.
