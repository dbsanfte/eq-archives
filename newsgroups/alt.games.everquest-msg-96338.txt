So I guess the tactic here would be to get summoned, then back off a bit to
cast, then get summoned, and repeat (hoping the melee damage doesn't kill
me).

That may have been the case.  When it summoned me, I noticed the lotus was
already at half health.  I also noticed the corpse of what appeared to be a
high-elf paladin lying beside the lotus.  So quite possibly, I was just in
the wrong place at the wrong time - having arrived at the end of a fight
gone bad for someone else.

Thanks for the info,
