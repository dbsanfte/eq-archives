Nah, NWN is really a short term game for the most part. Anyone
in EQ playing it would be doing so as a diversion or because they 
are bored with EQ righ then. 

It is not a replacement for an mmorpg
because you really depend on the same exact people as you do in the
pen and paper games, which always made those flawed for me. You need
other people to play with and a good GM. People are expecting this to
be some fantastic game, all it is is the first real time that you
could simulate the pen and paper game GM and other players in real
time on computers online.

It also is limited since your character gets to 20 and that is it. I 
know that takes a long time and you are a god pretty much by then in
the paper game but computer ones are acclerated with no dice rolling
or eating snacks.
