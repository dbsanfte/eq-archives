I mentioned this earlier in the thread, but it seems to have gotten
lost in the subthread about Ed being an incompetent crybaby and me
being a rude coward, so let me reiterate here:

1.  Click on the Options button in ZoneAlarm Pro for the application
you expect to change often.
2. On the "Access Permissions" tab, select "Identify Program by Full
Path Name Only."
3.  Click OK

This will disable ZAP's checksum process for that application, which
detects when an application has changed.
