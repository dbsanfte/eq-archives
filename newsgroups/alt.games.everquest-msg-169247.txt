    I happen to agree with all the points you've made.  But you mark
yourself as a jerk with these two words.  Yes, she was abrasive and
spouting an unpopular and in all likelihood unresearched opinion.  But
you come off as some guy from the forties telling her why she should be
happy making babies and puttering about the kitchen.

   Ok, I know that I'm coming off myself as a rabid woman's libber,
which I'm not.  But it's a pet peeve of mine.  I hate it when anyone
other than my husband calls me "Sweetheart".  Just call me "cunt" if you
want to call attention to my gender and have done with it.  Of course,
that would take a measure of honesty and courage on your part.

  Yeah, html is a Bad Thing on Usenet.
