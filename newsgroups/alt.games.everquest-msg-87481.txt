While it's not the best combo I can vouch this one works well lol, it's
actually what my usual group consisted of since we tended to play when
hardly anyone else was on and avail.
Difference may be that I was a de cleric and had my symbol so we had a snare
even though it was an extremely crappy one and we all had our booties for
when we hunted in zones where we could use them. The really sore point was
the lack of an evacer so we were really constricted on where we could hunt
=(
