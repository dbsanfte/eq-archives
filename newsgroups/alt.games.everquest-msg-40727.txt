Ok heh I've calmed down now.
Yeah I guess it is called Station

I sent it to the billing dept.
I sent a second one explaining that I wanted a personal answer instead of
some automatic crap ...no response so hopefully thats good.

For a minute I tried putting in my station name/password and it said "Could
not connect to server try again in a few minutes" so I thought maybe it was
server trouble all along....
Just now I checked ..it gave me the same message "The username you entered
has not been registered...if you are a first time user....ect"

So how am I supposed to contact Verant?  No phone support (even if it did
work its not 800). No e-mail support yet....c'mon this is annoying.
Everquest is the most popular MMORPG out there...I would expect them to hire
some more customer service reps .. (I do remember when I first started
playing it did a survey thing asking something like "Would you pay $80/month
for better customer service? LOL)

So do they just expect me to buy the game again? Thats not happening, I
never was a EQ addict I'm just looking for something to do for a couple
months...then I'll cancel again.

So any suggestions on what I could do? Thanks.
