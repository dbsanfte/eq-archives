Celeron is pretty good anymore. 
He has 512 meg of memory, its pc 133 Sdram, is what he is saying.
He is not saying he has 133 ram of memory.
This is a fine setup.
I Don't know much about ATI 8500s.

Kind of need more information like how far clipping is set out.
I have a celeron 1.8ghz, 512 meg fo pc 133 ram, Geforce 4 ti 4200 4x
Ahp 128 meg and am doing great. When I use old models and low textures
(which I assume is what you mean by "video quality") I move like a bat
out of hell even at 1024x768 and 32 bit color. I have clipping set at
only 5 percent, since you see about as far outside either way but it
helps a ton in areas like shadow haven or shar vahl or especially the
bazaar. In the bazaar I move around quite well with 500 players. 

Usually the largest mistake a person with an okay system makes is
clipping and having it set out too far. Try 5 percent for a bit,
you'll be surprised at how you don't miss anything and your FPS is
much higher.

I know it seems like you should be able to have higher settings, but
remember that EQ is pretty unoptimized. This is even more apparent
with  all luclin models. I got into Anarchy online after getting the
geforce 4, which has had most of its problems fixed. Its quite
accelerated now and my system really shines while I can have visuals a
bit higher. This is because AO was built from the ground up with its
interface and graphics while EQ's was pasted on. The game is riding on
tech that is over four years old now and has never been upgraded at
its most fundamental points.

If you try clipping on 5 percent and such, while still being choppy,
try things like seeing if your sound/video/netcard are on the same
IRQ. Xp and even 98 are made to share IRQs, but the more sloppily
programmed something is and the more its demanding of resources the
more this might cause problems. As the other player says if you
disable sound and performance shoots up its a clue.
