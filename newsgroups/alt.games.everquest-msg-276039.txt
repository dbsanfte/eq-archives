No, you need to pay more attention.  This is usenet.  On usenet, a)
not everyone has a threaded newsreader (increasingly rare, perhaps)
and b) even if you do have a newsreader that does threading, it will
quite likely not display old posts you've already read.

To me, your post shows up on its own with no context, because I'd
already seen Graeme's post, so if you hadn't quoted him I would
have had no clue what you were talking about.  I think this goes for
most people.

You should also make sure to cut the signature when you reply, the bit
after the "-- ", as well as anything that isn't necessary for context.
This makes life easier for those who try to read what you write.
