being kos depends on more then your race.    You have to take into
consideration your race, class, religion, and what mobs you have killed.

As a general rule of thumb, if your not a bad guy stay away from oggok, OT
outpost, Neriak (troll, ogre, dark elf homes)    A human/gnome agnostic
wouldnt be kos in OT, but if you kill VS faction mobs (kaesera, karnors, HS,
maybe even some DL drolvargs) you would soon become kos.

A gnome necro would be generally ok around Gfay, but kos in FV (the Kunark
elf city)

If your an iksar your kos anywhere outside of Cabilis

This doesn't apply to Velious - you start dubious to dorfs, kos to dragons
and giants.

Killing Dorfs raises giant faction
Killing Dragons raises giant faction
Killing Giants raises Dorf and Dragon faction

Like most things in EQ, faction is changable if you have the time and effort
to put in
