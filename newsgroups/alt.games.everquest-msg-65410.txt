At 384 meg ram, I got a reccomendation for only 20 character models.  Even
limited to 20 models, the game ran very sloppily... I eventually chopped
every model out but the horses/elementals, the (can't get rid of it) Vah Shir,
and male dwarves (my main... since I wanted to be able to control how others
would see him)

This, along with running dragon raid protocols (clip plane down, sky off,
so on and so forth) and turning the new texture mapping down to Low instead
of the reccomended High made the game run smoothly as a Vah Shir in
Shar Val, which was one of the worst zones... heck, it was even smooth with
over 79 other Vah Shir newbies running around in the same zone.

My machine runs at 1.6 gig, and has a 32 meg video card... if they can't adjust
the game so its playable with the bells and whistles up with that setup, they
are really not shooting for anything the average user has available at all.

On the other hand, what a shot in the arm for the tech industry if we all
upgrade!
