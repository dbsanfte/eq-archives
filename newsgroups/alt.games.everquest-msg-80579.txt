Actually, I took a 3rd level Half Elf Paladin from Freeport to Thurgadin.
The only place where he died was along the shore south of the Tower of
Frozen Shadow.  Once I learned to swim around that part, I was fine.  (Still
scared witless, but fine.)

Study the maps intensely before you go.  Plan your route carefully.  Swim
past the Tower of Frozen Shadow (once you get to the Ice Gnolls, you'll be
fine).  Con everything, and keep moving.  Have /loc hotbuttoned in case
something aggs you.  Don't jump off the dragon bridge.  Don't attack any
cutle little turtles, no matter how 'green' they con to you.  You should be
fine.
