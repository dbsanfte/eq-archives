PPing sucks!  Im an exp freak..  and to PP i'd have to turn attack off for a
sec, to hell with that.

I was reading up on the epic, and those 2 items you need to PP.. you can
also kill for.  If thats the only use of PP on the epic, I doubt I'll ever
raise the skill

My rogue only groups with a few certain people... theres 4 of us in a
friends channel at the right level, and when we group its rogue, rogue,
ranger, necro...  weird combo maybe, but it works great
