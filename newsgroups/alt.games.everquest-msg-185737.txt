A few weeks back, I logged on to a message stating i was 'beneath the
world'..  I was then immediately ported to a 'safe' area...

I lost 2 backpacks full of stuff in the process, and so I petitioned.

The last thing I heard was:

[Thu Feb 13 11:23:09 2003] Valbin tells you, 'Hmm..don't see them.  I'll
escalate your petition for a GM.  They will have to reimburse them.'

Nothing since...  How long does this take?  Should I petition again?  Any
other ideas?

I've never been through anything like this before, and so I'd really
appreciate any advice you long-time players could offer...

Thanks

-A.
