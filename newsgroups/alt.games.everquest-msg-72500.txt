An interesting point... However it becomes moot, since i was soloing from
level 1, from level 16 i began Area effect kiting.  Without Jboots or Sow
you can quad kite 4 blue (some even even) Beetles in NK.  This is not
something you can just do at the high level game.  He just asked where i was
doing it now.
