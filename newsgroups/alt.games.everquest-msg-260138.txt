That's the rub: it WILL be significantly different.  Just like a
crowded EverQuest can be a lot different than an uncrowded EverQuest.
Even though the game mechanics themselves haven't changed.

It's possible that Blizzard will leave WoW servers terribly
overcrowded to the point that more than a dozen people are always
camped at spawn points waiting for mobs to spawn.  I don't think it's
very likely, though.

You're probably mostly right about that; however, I think it's more
along the lines that MMORPGs attract ex-MUD players as well as lots of
non-ex-MUD players.

So I suspect a lot of ex-MUD players are playing games like UO, EQ,
AC, etc. - it's just that they're dwarfed by the legions of non-ex-MUD
players.

I think it'll all come down to how Blizzard reacts once the game is
live.  I'd imagine (but I'm not sure) they'd be a lot looser about
rules of conduct during beta testing than during release.  At least, I
really, truly hope so.

If people aren't cooperative about sharing spawns in WoW, my time
there will, of course, be very limited.  (Side note: my favorite
EverQuest server, when I played, was Firiona Vie (sp?), precisely
because it was uncrowded and the people were generally extremely
pleasant.)

No, I didn't.  I'm going strictly on comments made by other people who
participated.

Okay, good point.

As a software developer, I've always had a hard time understanding why
some MMORPGs have a problem with "not enough mobs".  It seems like if
you're tackling something as complex as an MMORPG, you could include
code that makes sure the world is reasonably populated with mobs at
any given time.  It's weird to me that people should have to wait an
undue amount of time waiting for some mobs to kill.

I felt this way when Stromm went live: newbies wandering around
aimlessly looking for something, anything to kill.  I wondered why
code wasn't in place to make sure a minimum number of mobs weren't
regenerated, maybe even basing it off the number of players currently
in the zone.

It sounds like WoW has the same problem.

I wish I could think of something, anything, to give me a reason to
disagree with you.  I'm generally a fan of Blizzard's games from a
technical perspective, but from a game management perspective, I'm
concerned, too.

I'm hoping they're treating their first "real" MMORPG very
respectfully and learning from the experiences of other MMORPGs, but
management is often too arrogant to believe they don't know what's
best.
