Yes. Try dying more often... :)

Hmm... Sorry, that wasn't helpful, and I'm a bit ashamed of myself now.
Anyway, I'd say it seems like a sound-related issue, because I can't
think of anything else that happens client-wise when you ding. I would
try deleting eqgame.exe and that particular sound file, to force the
patcher to refresh both, or perhaps reinstall your soundcard drivers.
