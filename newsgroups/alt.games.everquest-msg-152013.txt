I've deleted entire zone files that seemed to be bugged and let the
patcher re-download them. If you ran the patcher already and it didnt'
exceed the maximum download size (which is pretty fucking big) then you
probably got them all. Seeing "three expansions enabled", (I *believe*)
is a server side thing just acknowledging that your account that you
logged into has registered a serial number for all three expansion packs
and has no bearing on this question.

The other possibility is that the three SoL disks have the "retextured"
versions of all the SoV zones on them. Very possible that hte SoL
install just found the files missing and replaced them with the latest
and greatest textured versions anyway.

Give it a go and try to port over to Velious someplace and see if it
works. Worst that should happen is you'll end up in the safe spot of
your current zone. But I think you probably downloaded what you were
missing just fine.

No clue on that one, sorry.
