After more than 1 year of playing, I want to play something else and it
would be a shame to let all the effort I put into my characters go away and
I know that there are people willing to pay to buy account so, I am selling
my accout. My characters are on Thristledown, the price is 250$(about what
it costed my overall + an extra to pay for the shipping).

I have a lvl 51 swordsman with GSC, Major smoldering stone, the hilt but
without a weapon. He's now my lockpicking mule and can summon portal(tied to
Hub and life stoned to Ayan Baqur). Is using a 8-16 BD VI, Coord IV,
Defender IV. I explored more than I powerleveled and he became a mule when I
started my Uber axeman(3 months ago) so my available equipment is not Uber.

Lvl 33 Extreme Focus Axeman with life magic speced(casting IV), arcane
lore(wearing lvl IV) and Item enchantment(casting V). Is able to use the
imbued spells on SOCS, has Peerless axe but without stones yet. He's tied to
his hunting ground: Lugian Citadel. He was my current main character and has
potential to become very powerful. His weakness is his relatively low melee
defense that has to be compensated with xp, he started with 10 quickness and
100 focus so he buffs to only 226 buffed if I remember well but with all his
available protection layers, it's not a problem so far.

lvl 35 Dagger Fighter Crafter. Can buff to 260 in Cooking and Fletching and
can buff to 290+ in Alchemy. Portal Mule, Has Gertarth's dagger and a couple
hiltable interesting daggers but no hilt. Has to be rebalanced toward
fighting to be able to fight Olthois. Can wear lvl IV and cast lvl V
Creature enchantment. Tied to crater

lvl 23 Battlemage. Cast lvl IV in Item and War, lvl V life but still under
construction. Intended to hunt in crater eventualy.

I have tons of lvl IV- jeweleries, clothings and armor and a few lvl V and
VI on mules.

The account comes with all the documentation I compiled. I hope the find a
good home for my characters.

If interested send an email to plantee@videotron.ca

Thanks.
