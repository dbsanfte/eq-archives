Rod Humble on EverQuest: The Planes of Power 
Our chat with Executive Producer at Sony Online Entertainment reveals
the company's plans for expanding the world of EverQuest, specifically
with The Planes of Power expansion pack.
By - Bryn "hardcore_pawn" Williams 

GameSpy recently had the chance to grab an exclusive interview with
SOE's Rod Humble (Executive Producer) who is prepping the latest
EverQuest expansion pack - The Planes of Power which will be
officially announced today. We ask Rod about the ever-evolving world
of EverQuest, and we find out the skinny on what players can expect to
find in this exciting addition to EverQuest.

GameSpy: How long has the expansion been in production? 

Rod Humble: Since January 2002. 

GameSpy: EverQuest has come a long way since March 1999. How will The
Planes of Power ensure that EQ continues to grow? 

Rod Humble: Planes of Power expands the choices players have and
represents a new stage beyond the traditional high-end game which
adventurers can experience. 

GameSpy: How many new zones will The Planes of Power introduce? 

Rod Humble: 18 new zones.

GameSpy: Can you quickly list off the names of the new zones and any
brief comments about them? 

Rod Humble: We will be keeping information about many planes secret
until players discover them at launch, but we will, for example, have
the Plane of Knowledge, which is a repository of a colossal amount of
information. Of course, finding that information can be challenging...

GameSpy: Regular players know that Planar zones are geared for the
high-level players and guilds. What will The Planes of Power offer to
the lower level players?


 Rod Humble: The Planes of Power will have many upgrades for
characters of all levels. For example, we will be announcing extra
planar trade skills and many more features once we get a bit closer to
launch.

GameSpy: You claim that the Plane of Knowledge will make travel around
Norrath easier. How so? 

Rod Humble: Many lands will be able to access the Plane of Knowledge
easily, and portals will be two-way. Of course, creatures of all kinds
can use portals, not all of them may have benevolent reasonsï¿½ 

GameSpy: Including The Planes of Power, can you give us a rough count
of the size of EverQuest in its entirety? 

Rod Humble: More than 165 zones. 

GameSpy: Will The Planes of Power use the new Luclin engine? 

Rod Humble: Yes, it will. 

GameSpy: It seemed as though many players had to substantially upgrade
their computers to use Luclin. Do you expect to see this happen again
with The Planes of Power? 

Rod Humble: No, we do not. In fact, since the launch of Luclin we have
introduced a series of patches that reduced Luclin's system
requirements. 

GameSpy: Can you tell us a little about some of the new items and
spells that The Planes of Power will bring?


Rod Humble: The planes contain treasures of great value but some of
those treasures are not always what they seem. 

GameSpy: Does this expansion up the level cap from 60 to 70? If not,
why not? 

Rod Humble: We are not yet able to discuss what level increases will
occur in The Planes of Power, but stay tuned for further
announcements.

 GameSpy: What can the really high level guilds expect to gain from
The Planes of Power? 

Rod Humble: A true challenge. Using our new quest tools, we are able
to create some astonishing new content tailored for different styles
of gameplay. I believe players of all guild types, including raiding,
role-play, and small group are going to be very pleased with the
content of The Planes of Power which has something tailored for each
of them. 

GameSpy: Is this the last expansion pack we can expect for some time? 

Rod Humble: The world of Norrath will continue to grow in the years to
come. We have not yet finalized any plans yet, although we have plenty
of ideas. 

GameSpy: Can you comment about any other future EverQuest projects?
EverQuest 2 or maybe a console version of EverQuest, for example? 

Rod Humble: Not just yet. 

GameSpy: What is the best thing about working on a MMORPG title?


Rod Humble: The constant feedback. When you work on a retail title you
get feedback all at once and then nothing. It's hard to learn much
from that. With an online persistent world, you are able to get good
long-term dialogue about specific game design features and make
changes in real-time. 

GameSpy: How well is the "Legends" server performing? Are there any
plans to bring online more premium services in the future? 

Rod Humble: Very well! We have been pleased by the response from
players and the GM staff on the server really enjoys being able to
lavish time on things they have always wanted to do such as dynamic
content and role-playing. As far as other premium services, we have no
announcements to make at this time. 

GameSpy: What are your thoughts about Asheron's Call 2 and other
upcoming MMORPGs? 

Rod Humble: Dereth and Norrath have happily co-existed for sometime
now and we wish them all the best. We keep repeating this line, so I
am sure folks are sick of hearing it, but it's true: every time a
major new MMOG has been launched, they have increased the game space
and our subscriptions have gone up. We just reached a new record high
of subscribers this month and these are mainly brand new players. We
have made many design decisions to help revamp the newbie EverQuest
experience, and so far the response has been very positive. 

GameSpy: What do you expect to see from Brad McQuaid (ex-SOE) and Jeff
Butler (ex-SOE) in the future?


Rod Humble: I'm not sure what Brad and Jeff are up too, but we wish
them well in their future endeavors. 

GameSpy: What does EverQuest hold for players in the next few years? 

Rod Humble: Over the next few months all will be revealed. Norrath's
future is bright! 

GameSpy: Do you think EverQuest will ever end? 

Rod Humble: Certainly we have no plan on ending it. As far as game
worlds go, it's very young. For example, TSR's Greyhawk is much older
and still going strong. For the game itself, it will continue to
change in the years ahead and evolve to better serve the needs of our
players.
