I had been playing since release, with a break of about a year. Came back
into the game about 4 months ago, and had no idea what DSP was until last
week, my first time in the zone. I never had a character over 30.

Don't assume that just because someone has been playing for a long while
that they know every zone and hunting area in the game.
