I can't tell you what the druid was thinking... Not sure why he/she felt the 
need to jump in. I was not having any problems with healing the group. Have 
no idea if he was experiencing lag (I doubt it). I just know the "help" was 
not needed.

I suspect (since I have run into this before) that some players just get 
"nervous" when the hps get to 50% and somehow *think* the cleric is not 
going to be there. I never cast CH before 50% (usually even less if they are 
not going down fast). But this tends to make some very nervous.

Yes, the CH message was displayed in plenty of time for the druid to see 
before he casted. He must not have thought it would get there in time. I 
know from my own experiences, that if they'd just put their trust in me they 
have nothing to worry about. They are in good hands. I get annoyed in the 
fact that their "nervousness" is a reflection of their lack-of-faith. But 
talk to people who know me and group with me often, and they'd see they have 
no worries... not brag, just fact.

On an especially hard mission (the one in question was not, btw...) I can 
admit it is too much for me and ask for the help. I am very communicative 
with the "lom" or "oom." This person just would not listen and felt his 
un-asked-for help was needed. He also succored the group to the exit a few 
times when it was not necessary, and that is what caused the group to die. 
No one could get out once succored (the game said "you may not leave at this 
time" or some such thing) and people were left standing there confused as to 
what was going on and got creamed. After rezzing and temping and healing, my 
mana was gone and the necro would not help... it ended up being a fiasco 
that would have easily been avoided.
