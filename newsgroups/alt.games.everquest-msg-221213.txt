What makes this really suck is that it drops your DPS down to Paladin
level (only at the very top end does DW still seem to outdamage 2H
from the parses I've looked at, itemization _is_ part of the balance
issue), and it increases the damage you take (riposte), and you still
have less reliable agro generation than a knight.

Enchanters can be your friend there too, Boon of the Garou gives you
+100 DEX, also +ATK and a 30+hp lifetap proc, only downside is you
look like a deformed monkey.  I did an LDoN mission imp'd once, I
was tanking at 55 for a group averaging 59 and wanted as much agro
as I could get, and I will never do it again.  The first-person
combat animation for imp sucks (I play F-P always, it's a big part
of the fun for me), it nearly made me physically ill.

You are right about everything except your unspoken premise that players
value versatility.  They don't.  Just ask a long-time Druid.  Players
will acknowledge the usefullness of versatility, even say it justifies
one thing or another that they actuially believe is important, and in
the same breath they proclaim that they have to have class X, or item Y,
or buff Z "because they're the best".  It doesn't even matter if they
are actually the best, it only matters that "my friend says...".  EQ
players, by and large, are slaves to fashion.  "Monks are awesome" and
bazillions of Monks appear, "Monks got nerfed" and Monks are rarer than
hen's teeth (only a slight exageration).

Any fix has got to take the stupidity of the mob into account, or it
won't work.  Warriors need to be superior at tanking (take it easy
Lance, don't get so excited, we know you like to call it sponging)
and that advantage is not clear enough at the moment.  Warriors need
to be able to protect the robes and healers behind them, and they
just aren't good enough at that right now.  They don't necessarily
need a hate generation boost tho, just an agro management tool that
gives them a fighting chance to do their job in an XP group (what if,
for example, you could block a mob from going past you for 5 seconds?
you can generate a fair bit of hate to hold that agro with in 5
seconds of dual wielding).
