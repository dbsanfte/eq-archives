Kinda surreal with two completely different moods going in the same
posts, but it works for me.

I was watching live on TV when each of the towers collapsed. I can't
close my eyes without seeing it. People were jumping off the roof...
It's like the desperate hope that the %.0000001 chance that some
miracle will happen and they'll be able to survive over being on the
building when it went down.

The estimate was 10,000 when I first heard it. 10,000 dead. 10,000
people who probably cursed their alarm clocks only an hour before.
10,000 people who never suspected that it would be the last time they
ever heard it.

Soldiers in a war wake up every day knowing that it could be their
last. Civilians live their lives, never suspecting they'll come to
such a violent end.

...there were daycares in those buildings, weren't there? There were
kids who were dropped off at school for the last time by their parents
this morning. There were husbands who kissed their wives goodbye for
the last time this morning. Someone in my guild had a close friend
that works in that building. No one, not her, not his family know now
for sure if he's dead or alive.

People die every day. But how often does it happen on such a horrible
scale in such a ridiculous act of violence?

One thing that shines through in all of this. The scenes of the
evacuation of the area on the news showed one of surprising calm. No
chaotic stampede of panicked people. Some ran, some screamed, but it
was surprisingly well handled. It could have been worse. MUCH worse. I
respect that so many managed to keep a surprisingly level-head through
it. There has been remarkable courtesy and courage.

For the first time, I am truly shaken. I didn't have any friends or
family there, but it strikes me hard. I'm glad I don't have to face it
alone. I have friends. Offline and online. I can't begin to say how
grateful I am to everyone who's shared rational discussion about this
with me.

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
