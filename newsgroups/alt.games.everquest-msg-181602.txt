Now THAT'S funny.

I used to take my bard upstairs in a building in Freeport and let
him sing his area damage song while I was doing other things to
improve his brass skills.

One day I was there and I hear the doors opening and a guy came in
and asked me what I was doing.  I told him and he asked me about
the Wandering Spirit in the next room.

Wandering Spirit?  I had to take a look.  Sure enough, there was
a transparent wolf there called "a wandering spirit."  It conned
green to both of us and he said "Let's kill it."  Something didn't
feel right about killing a mob in Freeport so I said "I don't think
that's a good idea."

Well, apparently he disagreed and felt that it WAS a good idea.

He hit the wandering spirit once and I saw "A wandering spirit hits
Borlog (or whatever his name was) for 283 damage.  Borlog dies."

I laughed and laughed.

What the heck's a wandering spirit?
