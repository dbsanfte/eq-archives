I'm not completely sure of the rules on SZ, but I suspect he worked very
hard to get his faction with the guards there to very high. Then he just
attacks an opposing faction and the guards will come to his aid because
he has higher faction with the guards. I've thought about creating a
good in Freeport (I think it's mostly inhabited by evils/neutrals),
doing the Jaram (sp?) and Rebby quest a few dozen times to increase FP
Militia faction, level to 6, and then attack all the neutrals and evils
at the gate there as they pass through.
