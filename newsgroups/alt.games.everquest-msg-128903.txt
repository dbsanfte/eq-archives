    Do the first Cann. Sit. As soon as you see your mana bar move, stand
again, Cann, then sit. Wait for the mana bar to move. Repeat. That way
you're getting the full benefit of medding AND Cann. Since each Cann is 20
mana, it adds up fast - for my troll in bearform (about 12 HP/tick regen
total with Regen on, call it 12.5 for ease of math) that's an extra 4 mana
per tick steady state.

    And I look forward to Dog-dog because of how I'm soloing. My shaman, at
level 32, is a massive twink - over 1 K HPs and 760 AC self-buffed. Out in
Marus Seru where I am now, I'll pull a Stonegrabber with slow, DoT with
poison, then melee with my 13/25 hammer, reapplying poison when it wears.
Having another DoT in the form of a hasted, buffed pet will make an
appreciable difference in my kill rate, I'm thinking.
