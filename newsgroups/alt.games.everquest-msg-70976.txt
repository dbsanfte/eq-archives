"If you are running under the Windows 95 operating system.......  you
may be entitled to receive a refund of the purchase price for the
EverQuest product(s) you recently bought and any
subscription money paid for the period December 4, 2001 onward.

.... upon the issuance of a refund, your account and characters will
be permanently removed from EverQuest.  Please allow four to six weeks
for processing."

------------------------
Here are the facts:

All Player Characters are tied to the Player account (original
CD-Key).

Example 1: Verant Does not Delete the Account
Win95_Player01 can no longer play EQ.
Win95_Player01gets a full refund on the boxed game/expansions and any
pre-paid months.

Win95_Player01 upgrades to Windows 98 two months later.
Win95_Player01 logs in and re-activates his account and monthly
billing. 

Win95_Player01 is now playing EQ for free. (with the exception of the
monthly fee.

Verant has no choice but to delete Win95_Player01's account, and
remove the registered CD-Key from their system. It is the only way to
insure against dishonest players getting bogus refunds.
