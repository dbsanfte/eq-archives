If you are the initial owner of both accounts, yes - for a fee (and
its a rediculous amount - $50). They USED to deny requests if you were
not the registered owner of both accounts ( I say USED to because the
OP claims he's done this). Me and my wife a few years back tried to
move a character from the account she was using to a new account we
had created, and since the original account was established by her
ex-husband, Sony wouldnt let us move the character.
