Hey All,

I've got a Shaman on the Quellious Server (Steeloak Grouchiebear), just
leveled him to 26 during the past couple of days. But, what I've noticed is
that the higher I get, the less I can solo. If I don't group, I seem to run
into problems even fighting Blues.

Yes, I've heard how great the Shaman class is. That kiting should be the
greatest thing around. But, I'm thinking its either me, or the tactics are
wrong. But, when I try the ole' Root, Dot, Dot, Root, Dot, Med, Root, Med,
Dot, and rinse and repeat cycle...I can't even get past the 2nd dot because
it's broken by then and can't cast it again because the MOB is hitting me to
fast.

I'm very frustrated and have checked out some Shaman sites, but I'm needing
help on tactics before I loose what I have left of my mind!
