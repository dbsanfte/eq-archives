speking as someone that has both i'll answer the question what one i use
most ..

I an regualy invites to join LDoN adventures and get good exp from them and
plat is good too .. plus the items you get from the points are not to bad
either

i have honted in LoV about twice .. i do use the extra bank space but i'm
sure i would live wthout it .. and the maps ar usefull but not a nesisity ..

one thing you should look at however is waht spells (if indeed you are a
spell caster ) you are missing out on .. i belive a cleric should go for LoV
first bat most other classes would benifit most from LDoN ..
