Hmmm...will that influence your choice between EQ2 and WoW, if you are
considering either of those games?  WoW is supporting Mac right from the
start, and from what I can see at places where you can preorder WoW, it
appears that both versions are in the box.

If you get WoW, will you play it on your PC or your Mac?

I'm thinking very strongly of getting a Powerbook when I get a laptop soon,
and that is influencing me on the WoW vs. EQ2 decision, as it would be nice
to be able to play a modern MMORPG on the laptop.
