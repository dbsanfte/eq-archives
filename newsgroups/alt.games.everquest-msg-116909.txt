I saw that.  The corpse /con seems to show that 99 percent of the time, at
least, the rez timer does stop while the person is not logged in.

However I have no problem believing that
1) there might be (or are) some bugs in the code that allow the timer to keep

2) A GM would hit thier hotkey over it.   (/r I'm sorry, I cannot help you
with that.  Adventure on!)
