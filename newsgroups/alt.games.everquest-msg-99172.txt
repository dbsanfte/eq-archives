Also note that you will want to snare the mob (darkness line)
You may want to dot it
You definatly want to /pet attack

This takes quite a bit of mana.
Probably too much for it to work well at level 4.
Also you will get lots of resists on your fear.

At 4 your best bet is to help your pet tank and life tap to get back
HPs.
