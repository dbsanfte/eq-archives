I am a fairly low-level (16) master smith (181). Therefore, I have
been able to make a decent bit of plat and wheel and deal for some
pretty sweet gear. One thing has come to my attention. Although web
sites like EQPrices.com, EverLore.com, CastersRealm.com and
Allakhazam.com offer very comprehensive pricing databases, people
always dismiss them as being very inaccurate.

Now, for whatever reasons, this apears to be true to some extent.
However, consider a few facts about EQPrices.com (my personal
favorite) for example:

1. They show prices on a per-server basis, so discrepancies between
servers are not a problem.
2. They impose rules that prevent someone from posting terribly
inaccurate prices (Wurmy for 100pp). They won't accept prices too far
removed from the norm. It requires more of a gradual trend to alter
the prices.
3. They guard against multiple price postings from the same person in
a given time, thereby preventing one person from dragging the price
down or jacking it up.

I would think people would be more willing to keep this database more
current. I spent a couple of hours in NFP buying/selling the other
night. The next day I went to this web site and posted the actual
selling price of most of the stuff I bought/sold. It took maybe ten
minutes.

It's not that much trouble and could really help to stabilize this EQ
economy that everyone is always complaining about.

Just my 2cp worth.
