the problem I see here: yes, wizards can deal awesome damage. yes, they've
made some improvements to wizards. but at HIGH levels only. what about the
low to mid level wizards? where are their improvements? those are the
toughest levels for most wizards I know (including myself) to find groups,
and it's more difficult for them to solo..  yet, nothing has been done to
improve that. Even at 45, it's still hard for me to find a group. and I
usually end up grouping with the same people, because they know I'm a good
wizard, and they know what I (personally) can do. and some of you might say
that I should just solo. well, soloing is boring. I prefer grouping. and if
Verant wants this to be a group oriented game (which so far, they've shown)
then they really ought to make all classes groupable...at ALL levels, not
just high levels.

also, the improvements that they HAVE made to wizards (at high levels) are
extremely difficult to get. I STILL don't have my invis to undead spell that
I was supposed to get 6 levels ago, because I refuse to pay the 1200pp and
2000pp that the TWO people on my server that have actually had it for sale
wanted for it. Doesn't anyone else see this as just plain wrong? the same
for Translocate. I'm sorry, but this spell is worthless to me personally, as
I can't even use it on myself. so why are the people who it WILL be useful
for trying to gouge me when selling it? I got lucky, and found someone who
was only selling it for 200pp. but then, that's another story. the point is,
only HIGH level wizards are getting improvements, while the lower level
wizards remain screwed, and even the high level improvements can be nearly
impossible to get (and yes, I realize that they've done the same with other
spellcasters, and I think it's wrong for any class, not just wizards.)
