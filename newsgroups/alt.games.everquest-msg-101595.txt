If they are black it does seem to be a driver issue. Some people with
the black characters and geforces found that it works if you use the
27.20 drivers that the verant luclin support site now links to, or the
new 28.32 drivers from nvidia.

What a bunch of us on tnt or tnt2 chips have found, is that even
trying every driver known to man (as well as the verant ones) we have
NAKED models, with naughty detailed bottoms (oh my...) when doing
dopropertinting AND our skin is ironically still tinted if the
clothing was ;)

So it seems broken for TNT or TNT2 while for geforce you just need to
try a different driver until it works.
