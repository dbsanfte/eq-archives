> my dps blows.....

Even at 61, with max Archery and Offence, 260 STR, 250 DEX, ~1420 ATK
(with a Focus buff and own attack buffs) and Tolan's summoned arrows
my hits are in the 80-120 range (more if I get the double damage bonus
for stationery, non-rooted mobs).  With TS I get crits in the 5-600
range (bow is a Nightmare Compound).

Until I get EQ (and I can start using cultural arrows (a bit too
expensive for normal plinking) with their much improved damage)) my
Melee DPS is going to be at least as good as my archery output.  Once
I get AM3 I&#8217;ll probably never wield a sword again :) (J/K!)
