I feel your pain, man... Now feel mine: I bought a faster secondhand 
computer (going from a 300MHz to a 800MHz one, Yay) and since it was 
quite bare-bones in setup, I cannibalized my existing one for bits and 
pieces. As I was installing Windows, the AGP port died on me, so the 
video card was outputting a whole bunch of nothing. I stopped the 
installation and un-cannibalized my previous computer, but something 
must have gone b0rked when changing my old hard drive from master to 
slave in the new box back to master in the old box, so that the OS 
cannot be found anymore.

So here I am, EQ-less and questioning whether to bite the bullet and buy 
a brand new high-end PC, knowing fully well it will be for EQ alone, 
since all my other computer needs are met by the Mac (looking better and 
with a hundredth of the hassle, too).

Bah.
