At lower levels (10 - 25)  I grouped almost exclusively with a necro, with
my Monk. Between the monk's and his pet's damage output, and his own DOT's,
darkness, and fears, we pretty much ruled. Course, then again, he was
basically a Necro with his normal pet and an uberpet =)

Necro's are an extremely powerful class, I've seen the same Necro solo
yellows at 30, which is something few other classes can accomplish.
