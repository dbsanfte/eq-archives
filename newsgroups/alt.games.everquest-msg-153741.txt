Unless minimizing it would prevent the video card from even trying to
process anything, that likely wouldn't work (meaning it can't be running the
stuff in the background & just not having to display the graphics...so yes
framerate will be better for the screen, but how much memory does it still
take up?...I've only got 64MB).  Even reading text in Outlook Express has
been able to cause delays or other effects I mentioned.
