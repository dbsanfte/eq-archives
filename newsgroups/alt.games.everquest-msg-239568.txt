From the shadows, the mysterious "bob" <darkflame19@comcast.net> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>1) i don't capitalize when i type.  not only has it become a sort of
>trademark, but it also helps when i want to EMPHASIZE something.

It makes you look like a buffoon. But hey, if you're okay with

>
>2) HAHAHA! none of you caught it when i spelled "compensation" wrong!
>(notice how me laughing was emphasized by the capitalization)

Yes, it reinforced my opinion that you are a buffoon.

Ignorance is correctable and therefore forgivable. Wilfull ignorance
deserves to be punished and mocked.
