I was fortunate enough to do some software development on Crays.  You
can spare me the lecture.

Emulating EverQuest on a Cray would not result in a better experience
than just playing EQ on a high-end PC.  The serialized nature of what
you'd need to emulate does not play into the strengths of the typical
supercomputer which is highly parallelized.

Now, if you were talking about porting EQ to the Cray, sure, you could
leverage the strengths of the supercomputer and you'd get fantastic
results.
