Doing that myself now - a couple points I learned the hard way...

1.  Stay near a zone - If you are going after dark blue MOBs, even a green
ad can suddenly tip the balance badly, and when you are getting damaged they
will be tempted too jump in...

2.  NEVER let your SOW get low [once you get it] - superior speed can save
your life

3.  Check the zone level charts on EQ atlas to find the zones appropriate
for your current level

4.  Practice archery a LOT - is easy to level without, but the root/arrow
combo can work a target down nicely before you go toe-to-toe IF you keep up
the archery skill

5.  When you get to level 40 [where I am now, and want to solo against dark
blue for ep, the griffons and panthers in Nedaria's Landing are the place to
go - snare one, run back to dock, kill him at your leisure - much easier
than same con on the hill giants in Raithe, when you are soloing...


My two coppers worth...
