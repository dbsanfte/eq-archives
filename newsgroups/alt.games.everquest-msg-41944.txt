Haven't done this specific quest, but did you try repsonding with "you are dead"
or "You are dead?".  I know anybody would find it shocking that the required
response for a quest NPC might have a typo in it <g> in a couple of cases, you
actually have to change the pronouns to match the conversation. Ran into that on
the GB quest. Drove me nuts for a while.
Just a thought.
