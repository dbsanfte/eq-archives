    Our first attempt, we'd only ever done Ring of Fire and got to wave two
or three before wiping (remember my chain-summons post?) We then didn't go
back for some time, and when we went back we killed it. The new style of
fights with multiple offtanks required has a learning curve to it.

    Sontalak drops a ton of spells that are pretty rare otherwise, and a ST
key. The reward is there. The top two items our melees want are Bile-Etched
Chokers and Primals (new recruits have neither, big turnover since Luclin),
so the ST key is a big thing.

    How many people the encounter requires, and whether any special strategy
is needed for the pull or the fight. That's how I do it mentally, anyways.
