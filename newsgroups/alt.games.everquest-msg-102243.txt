The only way xp is shared evenly is if you are the same level.  At higher
levels you can get xp while grouped with a greater range, but the percentage
you get is based on your persent of the total levels present.  I'm not sure
of the exact formula, but one I've seen was:

If a 20th, a 24th, and a 26th grouped, first you add 10 to each level, then
get the total, 100 in our case.  Then each would get a percentage based on
how much of the total they make, so 20th gets 30%, 24th gets 34% and 26 gets
36%.
