Duh?  Maybe "Duh" from EK, but from NK?  Yes, it's west, but that's not too
intuitive.  Southwest would be intuitive.  Following this logic, shouldn't
WK be west from SK?

I'm the kind that prints out all the maps if I ever plan on going there, but
I don't hold it against someone if they don't know how to get somewhere -
especially if it isn't intuitive.
