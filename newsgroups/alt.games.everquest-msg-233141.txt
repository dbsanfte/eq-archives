Nowhere near the same level but we had 27 pally, 25 enchanter, and 25
cleric.  Had a 26 monk but he just stayed on long enough to get us the
adventure and get in.

We were moving somewhat slowly of course but moving none the less.
Normal assassinate mission.  Killed enough spawns for the boss to pop
and b-lined for him.  Turns out it was a her and she and her guard
were enchanters.  After a nice "charm the pally and send him in like a
death-scythe" we regrouped for CR with 20 minutes left.

Made it back to mob and took her down but literally 30 seconds too
late.  Failed the mission but hot damn was the last 20 minutes
intense.  Learned a vluable lesson for this level as well; don't waste
time on the 10% rez.  Takes too long to recover form the effects.  Or
at least wait until after the boss has been killed and rez after the
fact.
