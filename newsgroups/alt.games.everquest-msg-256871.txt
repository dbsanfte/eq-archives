Back when 60 was the maximum, 255 was the cap.  It went up to 280 with 
level 65 and no AAs, 5 points per level over 60.  Planar Power AAs 
allowed all stats to go up to 305, and Innate Enlightenment AAs allow 
Wisdom and Int to go up to 355, the current cap on those stats.  The 200 
cap is a soft cap, at which point a higher stat makes much less 
difference than it does up to 200.
