Arrows -do- get taken from the quiver... if you put the quiver in a
lower numbered inventory slot than any other arrow stack or container
with arrows you may be carrying.  Hmm, they must also be identicle
arrows to the one in your ammo slot.  And as long as you have
any arrows just like the one in your ammo slot, your ammo slot will
never go empty... you'll draw down to one, then start drawing off
the stack that is farthest towards the upper left (number one) inventory
slot, and if that slot has a container in it, the upper leftmost stack in

that inventory slot, till it runs out.

Quivers used to be a sick joke on Verant's part, fewer slots than
other containers, and useless (as slots emptied of arrows) for putting
normal loot into, with no benefit to the user.

Now, however, all quivers have a haste component to them.  Look
at the "weight reduction" line in your quiver.  Haste is proportional
to that (IIRC, its 1/4th that value)  This means that if you
are drawing your arrows from that quiver, your bow will cycle
to let you shoot again more quickly then if you had the arrows in
a backpack.

Nothing as far as you are concerned.

You'll notice from time to time a message that "your will is not
sufficient to command this weapon"

Weapons with effects on them "proc" occaisionally while you use
them.  The rate at which they do so is based on your dex, and
they check each time you swing, so faster weapons have more
chances to proc.

The other check, though, is for your level.  Most weapons have
a minimum level before they will proc.  Velium weapons have
a minimum of 25th level.  If you aren't high enough level when
you get a success on that dex check, you get the "your will"
message instead.

Once you hit 25, if you are still using that velium sword (probably not)
you'll start getting velium shards, which is a direct damage spell,
doing up to 12 points of damage, depending on whether your target
makes a save versus cold.

In a word, lame, at 25th level.

Its possible to get a "coldain velium" weapon instead, thru a
quest or by buying it from vendors in Thurgadin. These weapons
are slightly better than regular velium ones in terms of damage
ratio (can't remember whether they are faster or hit harder) but
also "proc" at level one.  At -that- level, doing 12dd once or
twice a fight means a -lot-... heck, it wouldn't be bad at -your- level!
