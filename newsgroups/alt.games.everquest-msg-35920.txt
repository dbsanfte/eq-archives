Hey, it's not ALL trolls, just those damn no sense of humor guards and
trainers or whatever they are.  Being able to bank once with invis
song convinced me that I should be able to do it again.  Being able to
run around with dark elf illusion gave me a false sense of security
that was quickly shattered by the shaman's guild.  Not to mention that
I've snuck out of Ogguk dozens of times and only died once vs. dying 3
times while trying to sneak out of Grobb while almost NEVER being
bound there. 
Someday I will have my revenge.  I will take as many guildies and I
can, and I will repay those green-skinned bastards.  It's nothing
personal, and I hope I don't slay any of your relatives, but I will
have my vengance.

oddly fond of orges though
