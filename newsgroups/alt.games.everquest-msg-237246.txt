You know, out of curiosity, I went in and did a google for David
Maynard in that group and found the thread you're talking about. The
"caning" is a brief side-tangent in the discussion, and a small
handful of people arguing against bottom-posting hardly constitutes a
"caning" (more than one of them only pitching in "I agree" to the
pro-top posters). I also note that, while Maynard cited several FAQs
and such to back up his statement about bottom-posting being proper
netiquette, the opposition doesn't even attempt to do so. In fact,
they don't show any indication that they even glanced at his sources.

Your little "caning" only served to reinforce the general opinion many
have that top-posters are clueless "n00bs".
