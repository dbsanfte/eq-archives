Thats a complete joke. Pure-team vs Cross-Team was never a major concern on 
Vallon ( and from what I heard Tallon ). Besides, any hard core pure-teamers 
left have been left way behind in progression ( Elf team for exmple simply 
cannot progress as far on thier own as other teams, especially the dark 
team ).

Where have you been seeing this ? Id be intereseted in reading the 
conversation myself.
