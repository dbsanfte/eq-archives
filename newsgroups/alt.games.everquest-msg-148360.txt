And for necro's don't forget that HP gear, since hp can be juggled with mana
through use of the proper spells

My 17 necro has ~550 hp unbuffed, though I haven't played him since he was
at about 400 hp.

My necro's magelo here:
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101720  (note: ammo slot
doesn't give stats, so the thought horror fangs aren't doing anything but
they look cool =p)  I also think I got him a different bracer than the
Crystalline silk one, but I don't remember what it is.  Oh, and yes, he's a
cannibal because I gave him a stack of BBQ Black Dude(tm) from WAAAAY back
in my Warrens days (and when I faction farmed there last month; wood elf
druid kindly to Paineel now)

Few cheap good caster HP items:
Ring of the Frost Spiders 5 ac 2 int/wis 10 sv poison 25 hp/mana - paid
200pp in bazaar  (and I wish my druid could wear it instead of a Diamond
Wedding Band; or that Shadel rings weren't lore)
Loam Encrusted Veil 3 ac 1 int 3 cha 20 hp 5 mana - paid 50 pp for it
Sickly Glowing Orb (range/secondary) 5 sta 60 hp  -10 sv cold - paid 150pp
for it, but see them in bazaar for like 5k  (thx crackpipe)
Giant Scalemail Legs (depending on race) 11 ac 3 int 20 hp -3 wis - dropped
in Kael off a Lieutenant at the bank for my druid, but I've seen them on NPC
vendors before, so I'd say they're cheap.
Coterie General Cape 8 ac 5 str 4 int 40 hp - paid 200pp in bazaar
