You've always had to be indiff or better to receive training as far
as I know. My Barb warrior had to do faction work in order to train
in Firiona Vie, as the trainer there was apprehensive.

Anyway, I believe the shaman trainer is on the TradersoftheHaven faction
which is raised to amiable by doing the deliveries for Trade Commissioner 
Henry. This can be done at low levels if you are very careful and use
maps to find your way through Echo Caverns. One can get through without
aggroing any mobs, but also beware the non-targettable plant things
with tentacles, for they are traps which will root and DoT you most
nastily.
