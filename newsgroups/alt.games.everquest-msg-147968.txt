Yep.  The main problem with Druid/Ranger [#] DoTs is that the magic
based (Stinging Swarm etc) line are *godly* and damn near LURE resist
and the fire based line you mention (Immolate etc) are resisted much
more than if they were a DoT only often due to the dual resist check,
where's the motivation to use a spell you KNOW is going to be less
effective?

[#] Not that Ranger DoTs are in anyway shape or form usable past about
level 55.  Even with maxed Conjuration.  Which is another sore point.
