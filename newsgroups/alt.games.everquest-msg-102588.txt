I know I play more than 20hr/wk, but not necessarily EQ.  I play other
things, and fool around on Text based Multiuser places to chat.  Thing
is...  I don't need no damn warning telling me this is addictive.  Of late,
within the last 50 years of social evolution, especially after the advent
of the television, parental social ennui has been on the rise and has been
getting worse over time.  It has been going on since the whole 'Mortal
Kombat' and 'D&D' fiascos of earlier on, where people are suffering from
this problem are sucked in because of lack of interaction with their
parents to begin with.

The whole Columbine thing is a good example of how parents of the last
decade are pretty much socially inept as their kids are, and computer
gaming and movies are making our kids into efficient killers.

Now, while Reagan, in the 80s, has stated Video games are helping to train
future defenders of our nation, this is true to a point.  What is also
needed is the parental interaction to help shape the morale center of the
youth of our nation.  I mean, hell, my Cousins, the ones who grew up during
that period of time, playing on gaming consoles moreso than I did, are not
gun-totting, socially inept, or suicidal guys.  There are over 1 million
children and young adults who haven't turned into Columbine psychotics.

Like the Constabulary who threw out the lawsuit about Hot Coffee in Britian
said...  If you order Hot Coffee, you should have every expectations of it
being hot with the possibility it will burn you.  If you didn't want it to
burn you, let it cool down or put cream in it.  It is a shame we didn't
think of that, and are more of the 'We are too stupid to realize what we
get into, so we should have warning signs on everything.'
