this is a proven method that I thought of but never mentioned.  Preferably
you will not trade exact gold for plat.  So you get like a certain
percentage as a fee for doing the exchange.  Like trading 550 gold would
garner 50 plat, giving you 10 or 11 percent profit up front for doing the
exchange.  The silver and copper would also be included.
In specific places like those hunting the Frost giants in Everfrost area
(near VOX dungeon), they will earn more exp by not going anywhere, and the
coins are a pain to haul around / make it tougher to fight the frost giants.
Its in the high level's interest to do these types of exchanges.
