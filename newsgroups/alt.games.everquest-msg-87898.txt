Jazz,

Don't go overboard yet.  I've seen probably a dozen people complaining 
about what I expect is the same issue since the servers came back up 
today.  I strongly suspect this is a Verant issue, and they will have a 
patch our Real Soon Now(tm) to fix it.  Something tells me this is a good 
weekend to go to Vermont and drink beer and snowboard.
