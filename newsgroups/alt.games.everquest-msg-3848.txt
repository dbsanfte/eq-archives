Yes, it seems pretty likely this isn't a GM event, but a longer term story
event.  There was the agent that was hanging from the tree in Qeynos a
couple of weeks ago, and there's that female pally (somebody the faithful?)
near the Crow's Nest in N. Qeynos.  she tellls a tale of bravely fighting
the plague in the Karanas, which seems a little out of order, actually...

Anyway, it's cool to see a story unfolding like this.  The pace seems about
right- slow enough that everyone who's interested can see it, but fast
enough to keep things moving.

I like it.
