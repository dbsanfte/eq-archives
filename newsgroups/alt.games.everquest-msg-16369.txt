I would like to start a thread on what good ways are for lower levels (up to
15 or so) to get some cash. I will try to compose the responses and put them
on a website somewhere. If you put some suggestions also note at what
levelrange it is optimum and good zones to do/find it in

    First, please don't post in HTML, it is considered bad etiquette in a
non binaries NG.

Silk Swatches
lvl 10-15.
Just outside antonica newbie zones (EC, WC, WK).
Buy a small sewing kit. Hunt large and giant spiders and convert the Spider
Silks to Silk Swatches (stackable). The converts will always succeed. Mind
that you use SpideR silks, not SpiderLING silks.
Depending on the server they will go for 1-2pp a piece and stacks are often
sold per 25-30pp and on rich servers up to 45pp. This because mid to higher
level tailoring needs these silks for many items.

    At the moment, with the new Wu's Armour I have seen 100pp offered for a
stack, this is rare but hang anround EC and you will likely see good offers
to buy stacks. Spiderlink silks are not worthless at all, combine 2 to make
silk thread, combine one silk thread and a LQ skin to make leather padding
(used in FP armour) combine 2 threads to make a silk bandage, combine 3
threads to make silk cord, 1 cord and a LQ bear skin makes a large bag (10%
wt reduction) 1 cord and a grizzly bear skin makes a Bearskin Potion bag
(sell to shaman for 20 - 30pp or just keep as a light 10 slot small item
carrier)

Bone Chips
lvl 1-5.
Most newbie areas (NQ, EC, GF, ButB, NF).
Hunt the decaying skeletons and collect their Bone Chips (stackable). Necro
characters need these chips to summon their pets, so sell them to players.
Usually 2pp per stack. Might get lucky and get up to 4pp

    In Nek you can probably get 5pp a stack with all the hi levels passing
thru (Hate raids or just going to Lava storm to hunt in Sol)

Greater Light Stones
lvl 10-15
The wisps who drop them can be found in a lot of zones. Erud's Crossing and
WC are known to have many around.
You need a magic weapon for this. Hunt will-o-wisp's. They drop lightstones
of 3 varieties: Burned-out (worthless, can't be sold), normal (worth around
8gp to 1pp) and, the main price, the Greater Lightstones.
There are rumours that the greater lightstones are destroyed if damage
spells are cast on the will-o, but this I don't know for sure.
The greater only sell for 2 to 3pp at stores, but can often be sold to other
players for 7-8pp. This is because of a quest in NK which will yield exp and
an item worth 9pp.

    Best to do the quest yourself, get a small amount of exp. remember to
have an inventory slot spare, the concordance is a container.

I'm sure you guys can come up with a lot more. But please only feasable for
"normal" characters. Not a cha-maxed lvl 1 HIE enchanter and Baking.
Although the skill might be profitable even for normal players so I might
include it anyway :) Another good one would be the Gnoll Fangs from BB but I
don't know the specifics for that quest right now.

     Gnoll fangs are good exp and faction earners but you get liitle reward
in the way of cash (a few silver for the BB Stout) Only money to be made in
BlackBurrow is from Elites and above with their drops, Studded and spiked
collars, rusty spiked shoulders plus the split paw commander and refugee
drop some nice low level items.

    Levels 12 - 14 (group) for good exp and nice loot in the Qeynos area.
Hunt the bandits in WK, do not hunt at the farm, you cannot see what is in
the farm house and 2 casters can take out a 20th level character, they will
make mincemeat out of your group. Hunt the valley, you can see all the
spawns there, sashes will give a bronze weapon and gold in reward + they
drop bronze weapons (at least the humans do, the barbarians rarely do unless
it's a mace or a 2h sword)
Do not hand in the sashes if you are a Necro or SK, you will lose a lot of
faction with the Bloodsabres.
