Ok, my shaman is 50 now ... and can not go to any major
Raid with AoE casting mobs (Lesser Dragons, Epics etc).
Where do I find good resist gear against the most common
dragons (fire? cold? or are some disease/poison?) cheap
and effectively? If cheap means i Have to hunt a lot, fine
with me. As I hit 50, I was planning to have a peek at
Old Sebilis (is that wise? Or do I need 55+?) since I
was told some gems drop there, that lead to reists gear
(what was that about?). Is there a website dedicated to
listing what kind of reist you need where? What do you need
to be able to let's say hunt Wakelands? Lots of questions.
