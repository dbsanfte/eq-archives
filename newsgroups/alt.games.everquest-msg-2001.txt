but then again, it looks like a Lamentation .. Most likely I'll get one of
these for my warrior before I can afford a Lam, and he'll wear it to guild
meets. =P

I bought an Advisor Robe for my monk just so he could look snazzy during
guild meetings. Added in my Adamantite Bo Stick (Suicide Stick at 30+ ..
procs a 225 AE rain spell) and then I just needed some GEBs and people would
start asking me for clarity or a port or summoned stuff. =P Heck, toss in
the potion from the Froglok Summoner in UGuk and I *WOULD* look like a
Magician. =)
