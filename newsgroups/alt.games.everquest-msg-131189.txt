I've been slowly upgrading the computer and one of the next steps I want 
to make is to buy a second monitor so I can actually (gasp) do something 
else when EQ gets boring (never! there's always gems...).  Question is, 
do you need a 'good' video card to do this with?  I've only got the 
generic one that came with the computer.  I can't afford to buy a 
monitor *and* a video card at the same time, so, well, I'd like to know 
if I'm going to need one before the other.

Ryou
