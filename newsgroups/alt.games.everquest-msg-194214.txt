If you kill only undead frogloks, you'll eventually get good faction
with the live frogloks in upper/lower Guk.  But since you're a bard,
aren't you at least indifferent to these guys?  Only good races can
be Bards, right?

Killing undead frogloks does nothing to help Gukta faction though.
But again, if you're a good race, I'd think you should be at least
tolerated in Gukta.
