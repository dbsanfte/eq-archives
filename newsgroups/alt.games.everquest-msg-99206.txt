Nah, actually started by a couple of our innoruuk.com forum regulars, mostly 
iksar monks at first.  There are a number of in-jokes referring to iksar porn

Well, the inspiration did involve a bottle of Rolling Rock beer, and a nickname 
derived from a body piercing.  If I were a half-elf with that thin moustache I 
could claim it's a pun on Errol Flynn, but he was rather a scumbag in many ways.
