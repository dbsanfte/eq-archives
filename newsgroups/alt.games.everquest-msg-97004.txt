I discovered something odd when I made a dwarf for the purpose of
underfoot mushroom farming. I made her blonde with a beard, and one
day, I turned on the dwarf graphic and played with her look. I gave
her that gray beard, and next time I looked at her with old graphics,
she was brownhaired and beardless. Also noticed that switching between
beard and no beard seemed to change her face, so I am wondering if the
command to give your female dwarf a beard graphic does nothing but
swap your face around...
