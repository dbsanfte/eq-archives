We were hit and level 53 by gas posion cloud if that is the one you
mean?  You CAN heal it with counteract poison (or abolish if
available) ... we didn't lose anyone but it was dicey for a while.
Just takes a LOT of casts.

Ours was set of by an AoE snare and the curing drained our shamans
mana, the healing was done after a med and due to this downtime we
just failed the mission ... oh well never mind.

Having said that ... at level 30 it might be a little trickier !!!!
