Do you have either j-boots, tboots, or money for SoW potions? Do you
have your Staff of Temperate flux? If you do, then here's what I did and
I leveled pretty darned fast. 25 to 28 in EK kiting craig spiders. Tons
of silk if you tradeskill, or to sell swatches by the stack. Easy kills
solo and not too many HP nor High MR. You can try quadding them, but
without snare the ending can be messy. Easier to just boot kite them
along the far East wall near the waterfalls.

29 to 34 I played on off hours, primarily, and having gotten Bonds of
Force, I quadded the gnolls on the hill side of the spires in SK. Good
quad subjects. Great place to learn the technique.

34 to 40 I did in Great Divide quadding the Dire Wolves solo, and
pulling frost giant scouts with a partner. CC is great for groups.

Pretty sure I'm going to EW next for Ulthorks for several levels.

Good luck.
