You can bind at the outpost quite safely. Just inside the wall in the north
east corner of the outpost is quite safe. You probably have to swim out
around the wall go get out tho. Sure beats running from fv.

The goons leave the outpost each night and usually follow around the path up
to the ledge. If you are a bit to the east of the ledge, or in the sw
corner, youll be ok unless someone trains a goon on you. Its usually safe
between about 10am to 10pm. Sometimes they are still around at noon if the
lighties have ben keeping them busy.
