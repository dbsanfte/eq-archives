For those who have skim read my previous posts or who cannot read at all
here are the points I was making:

1.    This group is the only one I have been in on many years on newsnet
that actively pursues top posters and discourages them ( in some cases flame
them) ... not the case with Lance's original reply which was very polite.

2.    The newsgroups I visit (list provided) are predominately top posters.
These people are just ignored or accepted for what or who they are.

3.    As this is an unmoderated newsgroup why don't people just ignore the
top posters and get on with discussing our marvellous game (with all its'
attributes and faults).

Additionally, in all of the diatribe which flowed out against me, ninety per
cent of the vitriolic comments  called me a top poster which I am not in
this group .. except when I am running for work and feel something needs to
be said, most of the posters appear to have read the complete threads , even
with contextual posting.  They prefer to swear and call me names pretending
that that is RL.  Not in Australia I would have to say which doesn't say a
great deal for the North American continent, if true.
