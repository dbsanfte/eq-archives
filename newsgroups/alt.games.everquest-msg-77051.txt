    Go pickup a crude stein. I believe that they are +15 char
primary/secondary. You can usually buy them for 10pp or so. They are easy to
find. Here is a tip, run to ogguk. When you zone in go to the merchant right
near the zone line. Often people will kill orge guards here and sell the
steins at the merchant there. I think I bought three of them there one night
as I ran there doing the stein quest for a friend.
