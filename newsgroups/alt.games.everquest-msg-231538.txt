Ok - lets step back a moment and look at the big picture for a moment
shall we?

Im going to make a statement that some may not agree with and/or like.
The more money SOE makes on EQ the better it is for everyone.

Why the hell should we care? Its money from our pockets to theirs.
Damn them... right?

Lets imagine for a moment that EQ was just scraping by. That their
profit margins were very slim. Would this be better for the industry
as a whole? Lets also imagine that all current MMORPG's were in the
same boat. Just keeping their heads above water.

Is this better for the consumer?

Lets now imagine YOU have a great idea for an online game and you want
to get it out there. First, you are going to need money. Not many of
us have the funds to personally finance such an endevor. So, you will
need the financial backing of a body that does. So... you approach a
company with your great idea. The corporate biggums read over your
proposal and think "Hmmm... looks good!". Then, being the shrewd
businessmen that they are, they look at the industry at large. They
see other games (done by big companies such as Sony) and see that
there isnt much money being made. They respond to you with some
generic letter basically saying "Dont call us, well call you".

If Sony makes a BUTT LOAD of money off of EQ, they may look at your
proposal in a different light. "Hey, Sony is making a ton of cash on
EQ - Lets jump into the fray and make something better than EQ"

The fact that Sony IS making money on EQ can only mean good things for
the future of on line gaming. It gives validaty to other future
prospective projects.

The future games may have a very different business model, but we need
to remember that SOE and all other companies are out there to make a
buck. And the more bucks they make, the more choices we will have in
the future. If all the companies doing MMORPGs go belly up, then we
wont have that many choices in the future.

So well all should HOPE SOE makes a tidy profit from this.

Hey, before there were any expansions many of us enjoyed the game.
That enjoyment can still be there, unless you MUST keep up with the
Jones's.
