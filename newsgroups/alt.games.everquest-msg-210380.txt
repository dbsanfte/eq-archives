Yeah, I noticed this too. It seems to happen at least once a session
regardless of where in the world I'm at. But, last night I happeded to be
farming HG's in Rathe Mts., and it happened 4 times in a row, as soon as i
appeared in the game and moved my character forward.

Looking at the EQ yech boards, it appears we are not alone at all in this;
most of the folks there have tried all that you mentioned and more, as far
as completely restoring their system(!)

Looks like a client issue to me. Hopefully the patch today will address it.
