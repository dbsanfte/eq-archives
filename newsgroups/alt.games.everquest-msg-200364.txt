You are free to treat the spell in that way.  And, perhaps, that is what
the developers hoped players would do.  But whether or not that is so,
the players are in no way obligated to play the game as the designers
intend.  Rather, it is up to the designers to entice the players into
following their vision.  [The GMs can, of course, actively coerce the
players, but that is hardly appropriate in this instance.]  Besides,
are you seriously putting forth the notion that KEI is meant to be the
exclusive domain of collectivist players?  Do you honestly believe that
individualists are meant to be shut out of anything a soloer can't get
at in an evening's play session?

I applaud your guild's common purpose and wish you well.  That does
not, however, mean that I condemn other players for dealing with the
"reality" of the situation in-game.  Where most players, even most
guilded players, are pretty much free spirits.  Hardly shocking given
that most players come from societies that promote and even celebrate
individualism.
