The Realm, Meridian 51(?), Ultima Online, and several pay to play MUDs
were all out well before EQ1 and all charged monthly fees. That's not
to mention "matchmaking" services for online gaming such as Kali that
charged, though Kali's fee was a one-time fee. Check your facts before
making a fool of yourself with such blatantly ignorant statements.
