i didn't think the eq2 group ever got off the ground


anyway

eq2 is nowhere near as big as WoW, so there are fewer jackass-types
about (and you'll find them at lvl 80) - even if the proportion is the
same (i imagine more jackass type personalities being drawn to the
"latest and greatest" rather than going for substance - eq1/eq2)


as far as server/guild, i'm of the mind they're interchangeable save
for the pvp servers


you definitely want the expansions because they all enable new all-
character abilities ... one expansion enables alternate experience
(aaxp goes into a separate experience pot to be spent on character-
individualizing skills) - i think faydwer - and the other, earlier one
(sky or something?) will almost definitely be included if you buy
secrets of faydwer ... the third expansion, i believe, is kunark, and
it's great for 50+ or 70+ or something ... get it if you see a package
deal or wait until you're of a level to use it (it offers a free
teleport system, like PoK in eq1)



have fun =)
