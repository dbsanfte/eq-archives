Warrior/Cleric... Warrior/Shaman... Either are viable choices. My
warrior grouped almost exclusivly with a shaman while growing up. (Now
I have a second account with a cleric on it, but I still welcome any
shaman for slow and haste and extra heals and buffs). 

I have a shaman level 45 but no experience grouping him with monks
after the monk nerf. I have heard it still works well, but the monk I
used to group with says the perception everyone has is that monks were
nerfed to the point of being useless, so he has trouble getting
groups. He also has developed a shoulder problem that prohibits his
acting as puller, so I don't expect to group with him any time soon.

Slowers are if great demand with PoP.  The shaman I grew up with got a
second account and made a paladin for rez's and to melee when I wasn't
on some time back. He never has trouple getting a group.  He does
complain the paladin needs heals too fast.
