I believe the Dreadlands and Karanor's have players of all experience
levels. It's unfortunate, but the number of places you can go at that level
and have a reasonable chance of getting a pickup group is limted. I've been
playing EQ since day 1 retail, I've been in every dungeon, been to every
plane, and I still send my alts to these zones simply because I can get a
pickup group there.
