This thread was about the affect of KEI on the person with a limited amount
of time to play who is more or less forced to solo. It specifically
addressed the concerns of a mid-level soloist. The repeated statements about
group dynamics, PLing, game balance, lowbies missing the "fun" of events,
etc., etc. belong in another thread.

My "take" on KEI was thoroughly detailed in the first post of this thread,
so I won't waste bandwidth repeating it. Suffice to say for me, KEI made the
game playable and enjoyable again.
