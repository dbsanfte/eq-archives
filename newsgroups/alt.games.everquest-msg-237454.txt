Level 17, almost 18 (was about 0.5% from dinging when the crud got me) - 
  800hp - 500 ac - 450 atk

I'm twinked... got about 70kpp worth of stuff on me, but the person I'm 
working with in my group for the most part has two 65 rangers and is 
making sure I don't screw up by being way too powered for my own good. 
He's playing the class of my main (cleric) and me his (ranger). It's a 
challenge but the ranger has been a blast so far.

Want to try a beastlord but don't know what stats I should semi-twink 
(i'm talking about spending 2-3kpp on a full suit of armor + weapons).

Matt
