Yes, though mostly we have migrated to the third edition and the group in
question, or the core of it has probably played about 10 systems together
at various points - and I think if you took all sstems played by everyone
in the group aie, I hate to think how many.....of that RPG group 5 out of
7 played everquest for various amounts of time, 2 from beta, 2 short term
only.

> And what are your favorite memories?

There are countless - many were very much had to be there - either
invovling mass hysteria from the gamers - or mass pant wetting tension.
Its kinda difficult to list that sort of thing.

Tiamat has more than 3 heads....says the DnD pedant :)

> What is your D&D memory?

Its not exactly memory, currently the brave party are staring at a small
secluded wizards house knowing its full of undead and constructs, low on
spells and debating a) how to get in and b) whether to dare stop for the
night to med up for more spell firepower...
