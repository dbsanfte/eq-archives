How about two druids, a warrior and two rogues in Velks? We survived a
couple minor trains. But then again, where Seb had the enchanter,
Velks has the relative ease of mobs. I'm just tooting my little "I can
heal too!" horn here, I am completely aware that I don't hold a candle
to the abilities of a cleric :) 
(In non cleric groups, I am pocket cleric. In groups with a cleric, I
am pocket wizard. Give me a Garou bone club and I'll be a pocket
necromancer against animals :) )
