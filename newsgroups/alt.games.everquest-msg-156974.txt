Exactly right.  This is what will happen at level 65.  There will be no
where but Temple of Veeshan, Veeshan's Peaks, some of Cazic Thule, Vex Thal,
and a few other blues scattered at the end of some other Luclin zones.  You
get level 65, you either live off from raid exp, or live in PoP exp zones.
Old World, Kunark, Velious, and Luclin will be almost dead to you exp wise.
95% of it green.
