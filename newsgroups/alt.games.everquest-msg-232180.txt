can a weapon proc without being swung ? (i don't mean without connecting, i
mean without being swung)

a weapon with 90 swings per minute should proc more than a weapon that
swings 4 times per minute, no? i say that with the [about to be disproven]
idea in mind that a requirement for a proc is a swing, and the more swings*
a weapon has, the more likely a proc is

*i should say "hits" but i figure i'm about to be told that a weapon can
proc without connecting, just by being swung; i would believe that, as i
simply never paid enough attention to the few weapons that proc to know for
certain either way...
