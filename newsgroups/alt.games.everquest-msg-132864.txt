Oh, that's hilarious! You realy think they go to church?

Speaking of which, I saw the oddest thing this morning.  I was driving 
through a relatively poor neighborhood in Chicago (you can tell by the way 
there's at least one church and at least one liquor store per block) when 
I passed the Rameh Prayer Temple.  Big yellow and red signs.  But, there 
were some other signs there, probably from the previous business to occupy 
that location, which was apparently Bless Bone's Bar-B-Q House, 
specializing in chicken, fish and shrimp.  And, there was a big light-up 
sign on it that said 'Drive Thru'. 

Somehow the idea of a church with a drive thru just cracks me up.

*skort*Welcome to Rameh's Prayer Temple, may I take your order?*chk*

Uh... bless me father for I have sinned...

*skort*Would you like salvation with that?*chk*

Uh... yeah.  Um, and a large orange drink.

*skort*That'll be $3.97.  Please pull up to the donation box.  Thank 
you for coming to Rameh's Prayer Temple!  Have a nice day!*chk*

Uh... Amen?
