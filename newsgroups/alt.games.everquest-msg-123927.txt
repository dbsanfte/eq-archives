Ok, don't know if you would have enough time but this seems like the best
way.  You have 17 worn items to worry about.  You can make a hotkey for
inventory and all other slots, just click and hold on it till an image pops
up.  Have 2 empty 10 slot containers.  Hotkey each to a separate hotkey
bank.  Hotkey all the slots that have items and put them in those 2 hotkey
banks sorted in order of value.  Then if you are going to die just shift-7
to get to the first hotkey bank, click open the bag and start loading it up,
shift-8, and etc.  Much faster to move inventory from the hotkey bank than
from the inventory screen.
