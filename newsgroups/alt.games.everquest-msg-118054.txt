Got my niece addicted to EQ and she wants to buy a computer so she can play
too.  She has $700 cash to put down on it and can afford to buy a system
that costs twice that.  What minimum specs should she be asking for in the
stores?  What graphics card should she buy?  What brand should she get? I
know she needs lots of RAM but beyond that, I'm lost.
