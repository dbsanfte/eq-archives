My wizard hit 29 (and 30) this weekend and got his first familiar.
Having seen some discussions about pet classes here, I wasn't
surprised that I couldn't get the familiar to attack anything, and
I did get annoyed at its tendency to wind up hovering in front of
my face, especially if I backed up.  (Which happens a lot when I'm
ML.  Mob dies, I move up to loot it, back up and sit.)  Later when
I had time to read about it some more, I learned I could tell it to
go away and still keep the buffs from it.  I do wonder what the
point is of having it be a pet, though, other than maybe it looks
cool.  I can't even tell it to stay put!

Today I noticed that there are some spells at higher levels that
buff my pet?  E.g., Firetree's Familiar Enhancmnt [sic].  But why
would I ever need to give extra hp/ac to my familiar since it never
fights?  Can it get hit by AE spells, and if so does anything bad
happen to me if it dies?  (In which case, again, why wouldn't I just
tell it to go away before it gets into trouble?)  Or is the Firetree
spell even more badly named than it appears, and it's really intended
for casting on the Flaming Sword of Xuzl (which appears to summon a
pet that lasts for only one target, but I guess you could buff it
while it's fighting that target)?

Oh yeah, I did find one other use for having the familiar be a pet
instead of just a buff.  I was able to cast Bind Sight on it.  Which
doesn't really have any real purpose except it was fun trying to
move my wizard around while looking through the imp's eyes. :-)
