The XP fix they made, has been verified by many sources to be bugged. They
claim "XP is only at 75% pre xp patch". Whether this is intentional and
secretly implemented as a nerf or just another bug remains to be seen.

My post at Statioin Sony EQ boards was quickly deleted (09/09/2002 entitled
"XP Still Bugged") which seems to support the theory that there is an XP
nerf but they dont want to go public about it.

Has anyone any reliable news?
