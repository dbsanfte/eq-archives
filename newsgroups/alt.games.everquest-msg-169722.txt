I should have clarified. To me, it looked like you were condoning the use of
"M'a b'tud h'duna wa''msyin." (For instance)

As for my example, I was contrasting Brer Rabbit with my writing. Brer
Rabbit's slang is rather exaggerated - in fact, it is to the point where
even the narrator's speach is difficult to read. Basically my "Colonel
Kenny" and "Uneducated Kenny" 'personas' were meant to show that a little
slang is a lot better than too much.

Of course, those examples were submitted due to what may be a
misunderstanding.

My largest annoyance with the pseudo-RPers is that they tend to over-state
how stupid their character is. The problem is in the process they lose
originality and of course legibility. Let's face it... the stupid
Troll/Ogre/Barbarian is rather trite now-a-days. It never struck me as
terribly original anyhow.

For the record, I'm rather tempted to start an Erudite Wizard on the FV
server that roleplays as a moron. "Durrrrr... casting Ice Comet on myself to
warm up! What the Hell?! I died? Note to self: cast Strike of Solusek next
time."

I guess it all comes down to a personal preference. Personally, "Me naw have
da majiks" makes me want to ram a knife into my hand... surely it cannot
hurt as much as reading that.

"Me don't have 'dat magic." - I think it practically gets the same thing
done and doesn't make me want to abuse myself in a fit of blind psychotic
rage.

Chalk it up to a matter of opinion?

You're taking what Katrika said literally. I think (she?) was using a vague
example. A little does go long way... however, 'a little' is a relative
term. So Katrika's idea of 'a little' might be one mis-spelling at the end,
but it could also have been what I used as an example.


Excuse me if I got your gender incorrect, Katrika.
