Got my hotkeys on the numpad - so 4 is assist (home
row index finger).

Who bothers to waste a hotkey on attack?  Num-Pad
enter works well for me.

BAH - another wasted hotkey - Ctrl-Shift-S 

It's funny, with my first character, a bard,
I needed 3 of the 6key banks to work everything
well.  Bank 1, the first 4 songs in 1-4, 
I can't remember what in 5, and sense heading 
in 6.  Bank 2, the 2nd 4 songs in 1-4, the
same 5 and 6 as bank 1.  Bank 3, 1- General
inventory 5, 2-Gen. Inv 6, 3-primary melee,
4-secondary melee, 5-Gen. Inv. 7,
6-Gen. Inv. 8

This was before you could use a keystroke to
cast spells directly.
