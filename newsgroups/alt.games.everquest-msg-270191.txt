I couldn't agree more! In the short run this may seem like a bad thing, but
I guarantee anyone who plays EQ2 it will be fantastic in the long run. It
took people months to get to level 50 in EQ 1 before power leveling (and
before Kundark). Now it takes maybe 4 days. Everyone has to earn their own
"right-of-passage" meaning no one can take shortcuts to become an uber-power
in the game.

To those who believe WOW is so much better, take this into consideration:
There are already level 60s, and have been for at least 2 weeks. Any game
where max level can be reached in the first three weeks of the game's debut
has some serious level balance issues.
Not to menchin that these level 60s like to play in enemy newbie areas
picking on level 10s. That is NOT a productive gaming enviorment.

The perfect MMORPG is far from being completed, but to those more
experienced gamers who know what they are looking for EQ2 is the better
choice.

Feel free to rip on any of my writing above.
