I'm quite happy to hear it's not only me. I've noticed that if you do a
/ <enter> to see who is in the zone while running, autorun comes on. It
also appears to come on by itself for no reason. I have recently started
a second character as a bit of a break now that my Cleric is 18. I know
I'm close to spells, but experience is coming slowly now, not knowing
where to hunt next, so I started an Ogre Beastlord.

Yesterday, while running (lumbering?) across the Feerrot, I saw a
Spectre and took my finger off the run button. You guessed it, kept
running straight into it. Back at the Oggok entrance, I decided it was
time for a visit to the moon. So far, they have been nice to Zarxx! One
even assisted in making him a citizen of their fair city, and got me
started on a claw quest. I thought the High Elf Cleric newbie quest was
tough, then decided the Ogre Beastlord one was even tougher as a result
of very rare Yellow Lizard Scales. They have nothing on the claw quest!
Three failures later, an eaten initiate cloak, a second citizenship
quest to replace it, I guess I've settled into a new home for a long
time to come!!
