You may be right about her wanting information, I guess I didn't read the
article closely enough. When I hear the word "Lawsuit" I automatically think
of monetary compensation or "punitive damages."

I think my point still stands, however, about frivolous lawsuits in general.
I just saw on the Today show this morning that a lady is suing corporations
because they profited during times of slavery.  I was appalled.  Not because
I think slavery was *good*, and I certianly sympathize with the mother of
the guy who killed himself, but where do we draw the line?
