bah my bad, hit enter and sent this message before I was done typing it lol!
Only problem is you need to remember to do that every time you patch
everquest if you keep running into that problem, not a cure all headaches
but certainly lessens them for me. Another option is I believe it's alt-y or
ctrl-alt-y will select the yes option in zone alarm pop up boxes int he
background if you are running everquest in full screen mode, doesn't always
work though and can cause the same lock up problems as trying to alt tab to
check the yes option.
