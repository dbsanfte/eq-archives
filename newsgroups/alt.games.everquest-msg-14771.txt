One thing that can help when you are attacking with Poisons, is to be
grouped with a mid to high-level Magician or Shaman.  Their Malaise line of
spells greatly lowers resistance to poison, and Magicians will often cast
it even if they have no intention of nuking, since it also increases the
chance that their pet's proc will stick.  If you're fighting alongside a
Magician and see the message "a mob looks uncomfortable," it just got hit
with Malaise.  That would be a good time to stick a poisoned dagger in its
eye.
