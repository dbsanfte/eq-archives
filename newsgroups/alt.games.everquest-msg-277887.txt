From the 4/20 patch message:

>> Rumors have been spread that the Ring of Scale have started to
investigate the new vampires of Mistmoore(RoS faction quest is in). <<


Has anyone found any info on this quest? Since they revamped MM, they've
made it pretty difficult to change RoS faction and I was hoping that this
quest would help. I'm beginning to think it's yet another SoE screw up.
