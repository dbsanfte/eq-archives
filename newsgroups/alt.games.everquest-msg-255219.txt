People HAVE been able to hit max level (50) in CoH in a matter of
weeks or less even without exploits as it is, too. Within a week of
pushing the level cap to 50 from 40, people were there. Entirely
hunting through brand new content.

AOE blasters level incredibly fast, too. The most skilled players in
CoH can level just as fast ( or possibly faster ) as they can in EQ.
The majority levels slower than in EQ mainly because of exactly what's
described above -- newer game, less spoiler information and such.

There are camps that even think that levelling in CoH is TOO fast. Of
course, I'm not saying any of this makes one better than the other...
