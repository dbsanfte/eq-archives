Deut.28
[1] And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the =
voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments =
which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on =
high above all nations of the earth:

[2] And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if =
thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

[3] Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the =
field.

[4] Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, =
and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of =
thy sheep.

[5] Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

[6] Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be =
when thou goest out.

[7] The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be =
smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and =
flee before thee seven ways.

[8] The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, =
and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in =
the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

[9] The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he =
hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD =
thy God, and walk in his ways.

[10] And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the =
name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

[11] And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of =
thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy =
ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

[12] The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give =
the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine =
hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.

[13] And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou =
shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken =
unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this =
day, to observe and to do them:

[14] And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command =
thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after other gods =
to serve them.

[15] But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice =
of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his =
statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come =
upon thee, and overtake thee:

[16] Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the =
field.

[17] Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

[18] Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, =
the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

[19] Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be =
when thou goest out.

[20] The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all =
that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, =
and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, =
whereby thou hast forsaken me.

[21] The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have =
consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it.

[22] The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and =
with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, =
and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until =
thou perish.

[23] And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the earth =
that is under thee shall be iron.

[24] The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from =
heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

[25] The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou =
shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and =
shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.

[26] And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto =
the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

[27] The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the =
emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be =
healed.

[28] The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and =
astonishment of heart:

[29] And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, =
and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed =
and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.

[30] Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou =
shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant =
a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.

[31] Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat =
thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face, =
and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto thine =
enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.

[32] Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and =
thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long: =
and there shall be no might in thine hand.

[33] The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which =
thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed =
alway:

[34] So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou =
shalt see.

[35] The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a =
sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top =
of thy head.

[36] The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over =
thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and =
there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.

[37] And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, =
among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.

[38] Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather but =
little in; for the locust shall consume it.

[39] Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither drink =
of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat them.

[40] Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou =
shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his =
fruit.

[41] Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; =
for they shall go into captivity.

[42] All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

[43] The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high; =
and thou shalt come down very low.

[44] He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be =
the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

[45] Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue =
thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou =
hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his =
commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:

[46] And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon =
thy seed for ever.

[47] Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and =
with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

[48] Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send =
against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of =
all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have =
destroyed thee.

[49] The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end =
of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou =
shalt not understand;

[50] A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person =
of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

[51] And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy =
land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either =
corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, =
until he have destroyed thee.

[52] And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and =
fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: =
and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, =
which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

[53] And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy =
sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in =
the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress =
thee:

[54] So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate, his =
eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, =
and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:

[55] So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his =
children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the =
siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress =
thee in all thy gates.

[56] The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure =
to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and =
tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and =
toward her son, and toward her daughter,

[57] And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and =
toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for =
want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine =
enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.

[58] If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are =
written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful =
name, THE LORD THY GOD;

[59] Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of =
thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore =
sicknesses, and of long continuance.

[60] Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which =
thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

[61] Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in the =
book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be =
destroyed.

[62] And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of =
heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the =
LORD thy God.

[63] And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do =
you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to =
destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from =
off the land whither thou goest to possess it.

[64] And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end =
of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, =
which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and stone.

[65] And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the =
sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a =
trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:

[66] And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear =
day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

[67] In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even =
thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart =
wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou =
shalt see.

[68] And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the =
way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and =
there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and =
no man shall buy you.

That sounds pretty damn bad. This is written to any nation that chooses =
to reject God, which I am sure they all have to some degree.

[49] The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end =
of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou =
shalt not understand;

[50] A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person =
of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

[51] And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy =
land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either =
corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, =
until he have destroyed thee.

[52] And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and =
fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: =
and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, =
which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

[53] And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy =
sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in =
the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress =
thee:

This is the antichrist's kingdom which has been besieging the rest of =
the world solely with it's ideology, but most notably the countries =
which are well known for their goodness, decency and greatness, US, =
Canada, England, France, etc. for at least 30 years, and it would seem =
that he has broken them all except the US which will continue until the =
end of this age even when God and his church has left, they will =
continue to fight in deed what they may not believe in heart out of duty =
for their country and it's laws which were inspired by God himself so =
that in the very end there would still be single beacon of light for =
lost travellers to follow until the end. =20
