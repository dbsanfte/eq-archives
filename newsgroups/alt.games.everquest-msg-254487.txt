there was a spot in the flags for this and that value display for mana
numbers, they just never worked...
your UI designer may have put those values in.

I did some UI customization back in the day. The customization wasn't tough,
it was fixing things after every other patch that drove me up the wall.

I wonder when they are going to cave and give us <groupmembermanapercent01>
and <groupmembermanavalue01>, etc...

Actually, I LIKED not having my mana displayed, that way I can just say:
puller tells the group, "Mana?"
/g enough
or
puller tells the group, "Mana?"
/g low
and not having rogues second guessing me on what 'enough' is. (FF has mana
display... We scream low on mana, puller says, 'ah, you got plenty', pull
comes and someone dies)
