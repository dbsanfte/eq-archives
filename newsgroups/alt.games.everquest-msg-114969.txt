After reading all the grief over the constant harassment druids
receive about people pestering the living daylights out of them for
SOW PLZ and buffs (and the constant pleading my cleric gets for
rezzes, my chanter for mana buff etc.) I figured the best bet would be
to encourage people to buy SoW potions! 10pp per dose isnt too much to
ask. My wizard buys them because I need them and I wouldnt ask for a
Sow unless Im grouped with a Sow class. SO QUIT BUFFING THE BEGGARS! I
dont care how little mana it costs.....just make them seek out a
shaman and buy sow potions....its the best thing you can do for them.
I think people getting cool potions from shamans is an underutilized
function of the game, they would rather just ask someone to give it
free than to buy it. Jeez....why not just have free
resteraunts.....I'd like to go to the Outback and have a nice steak
but I dont really care to spend the $18.95 for it....so why dont I
just go in and sit down and say "PRIME RIB PLZ"!

alchemist.
(Yes, I'm training in alchemy....so by the time this idea has
circulated
through the servers I'll have a line of happy customers....hehehe)
