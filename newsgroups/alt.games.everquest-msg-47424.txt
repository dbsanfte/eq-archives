Beg you pardon, wasn't my intention, absolutely not. If it sounded so, maybe
it's my poor english. I just wanted to know the feelings & thoughts of you
people there. And I am not complacent with what happened, happpens or with
what actually can happen, how could I? One bad thing about this events is
that they are unexpected. They always occur in an unexpected place, time and
way. How can you prepare for the unexpected? You say you got gasmasks and
stacked food for peace of mind... well, do you have peace of mind now? In
that sense I used the word paranoia (sorry), there's a limit in what we can
foresee and prepare for in future, without affecting our present..

See, in my country, we are somewhat familiar with terrorism. It strikes us
on a much lower scale, but steadily, week after week and year after year,
and always unexpected. No one is complacent with this, but we also have to
live apart from caring not to die :) Some people in the US have accustomed
themselves to live with tornados, it doesn't mean they like them. We get in
cars, go in official buildings, warehouses, music shows, although they are
all potentially risky. Politicians, reporters, anyone talks in public, what
they think, although they know it can cost them next blast or bullet. Those
of them who think they may be on the black list doublecheck their cars every
day, change their routines regularly but... what about all others? We do
tell our children not to pick up abandoned toys, but most importantly we
care for them to grow and mature in tolerance, since that is the only thing
who will change things to better in the long run, and will let us live our
lives with dignity, as long as they might be. When intolerants threat you in
this way, hiding between your friends, stalking, all you can do is stand
firm, say "here I am, and I am in my right, no matter what you do, you will
never change this".

I can tell you, peace of mind doesn't come from body guards, police
controls, bunkers, gasmasks or escape plans. It comes from interiorizing the
issue, facing reality the way it is, and this is not complacement, it's
plain survival. And it's a hard task, sometimes, too.

best regards
