Just to add to the fun, the original old testaments were written mostly in
Hebrew, but parts were Aramaic, a related, dead language.  I understand it
was written with none of the vowels, making it open to the interpretation of
the translator what was actually being said.  In Hebrew, there are no
letters for vowels, the vowel sounds are signified by various lines, and
dots over, under, and in the middle of the letters.  These are often left
out in written material, as it is generally possible to understand which
word is being used from context.  There are words that are written
identically, and depending on which vowel sounds are used, have different
meanings.  Even assuming that the Hebrew version in use today is correct,
the exact meaning of some words is open to some interpretation.  Translating
from one language to another is never exact.  My Hebrew is extremely rusty
at this point, I have not used it in 25 years or so.  Oh, and you probably
know, but "Oy vey" is Yiddish, not Hebrew.

If you really do decide to try to learn it, it is actually an easier
language to learn than English, in my opinion, but, as with any language,
does take a significant amount of time to learn.
