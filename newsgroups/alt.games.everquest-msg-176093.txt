If there's a cleric/necro (paladin/SK?) in the group with a spare spell
slot... invis to undead will break charm 100% of the time and is a level
1 spell which casts quickly with trivial mana cost.

The stickler is the spare spell slot of course... but it's a strategy I've
found useful on occasion. Basically it depends on whether the bard has invis
available (and a slot open) vs. the cleric/necro/whatever.

called for everyoine to be IVUed... oops.)
