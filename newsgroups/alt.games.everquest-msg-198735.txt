Well, "bubba", perhaps you are just that abrasive by nature...

...the implication that what I've said to that point was lacking in any 
logic, when of course it wasn't, but your saying it was was an attempt at 
bolstering your own "contribution" to the discussion.

It's not bullshit. It's fact. There is a *well-known*, and I would wager 
expressed by yourself on more than one occasion, predisposition with some 
people to show a bias against halfling druids, moreso than any other 
race/class combo in the game.

So you're going to flame me for merely pointing this fact out to someone? 
Say what you want. I don't know what crawled up your arse that day, but 
you obviously just piped up to pick a fight.
