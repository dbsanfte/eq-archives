No, you wouldn't.  I remember one particualr day, right after an emergency 
patch, only one server was up.  A production server.  So naturally, as 
usual, everyone and their kid brother went to gfay and started a new 
character.  Of course, the natives were thrilled and imediately started 
emptying their bank accounts... yeah, right.  I had a level 8 character 
I'd forgotten about on that server, so of course I logged in and wandered 
about.  Gfay was a disaster area.  Yes, it's usually a disaster area, this 
was worse.  I think the worst part was the idiot who decided it would be a 
great idea to get all the level 1's together (since this isn't our server 
and -we- don't give a shit) and conduct a raid on the PoD.  So naturally, 
in about 20 minutes the place was flooded with corpses and my frame rate 
dropped by about 75%.  Ad did anyone feel at all obligated to go clean 
up their freakin' corpses?  Oh, no, why would they do that?  They're 
going back to their nice clean server as soon as it comes up.  I'm sure 
the natives were just -thrilled- to have all these happy visitors stop by.

And just from the usual behaviour of crowds, I'd suspect that people on 
test have had more than their fair share of proddie incursions like 
this...

This may be an extreme example, but just et it be a gentle reminder: If 
you go to play on test, or any other server, there's gonna be someone who 
thinks of it as home.  So please don't defecate in the living room.
