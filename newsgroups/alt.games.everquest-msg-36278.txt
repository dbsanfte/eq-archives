No.

What's the difference between Scowls Ready to Attack vs. Glares
Threateningly?

Answer:  Aggro range.

The latter, you generally have to be closer and stand a bit longer
before the mob will aggro.

There's a small delay between entering "awareness" range and actually
getting aggro.  He could have just gotten lucky.

Best way to determine if you're KOS to CoV or not is to find a CoV
based mob and simply con it.  Anything in Skyshrine except for Yelinak
will work, the named wurm in GD, Rolandal in WL, etc... all will work.
They also don't see through invis so you can approach them while
invised and con them after you've targetted them and moved back a bit.

Or have someone on CoV faction target Whoashit and have them come to
you then just /assist them.
