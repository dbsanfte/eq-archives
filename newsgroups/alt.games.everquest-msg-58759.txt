Thought I would just put something in here, I'm Irish , I dont know much about
stuff in Ireland as I left when I was young and probably have no business
commenting but ...

This comment was unnecesarry and unhelpful to people who actually give a damn
about what goes on in Britain and Ireland.

It would be better for all of us if people generally, thought a bit before
opening the hole in their faces.  2 ears, 1 mouth , use it those proportions.
