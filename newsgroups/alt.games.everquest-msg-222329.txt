As usual, I was main looter for our ldon group -- a result of having vast
numbers of 6-slot 100%WR bags. At the end of the adventure, I'd sold
everything but 2 goblin bones and a Flowstone Idol (all/all range slot
item). There were 5 of us in group, 3 items to random. I had each person
random one time, top roller gets first pick, 2nd highest gets second pick,
3rd highest gets remaining pick.

After we did this, 2 of the group members complained that this was a stupid
way to divide treasure, it was unfair, high-level people never do it that
way, blah blah blah. These two players were sure the only way to divide
loot was to have everyone roll once, high roller gets his pick. Then the
non-winners roll again, high roller gets second pick, etc.

(1) Correct me if I'm wrong, but the probabilities for getting loot work out
the same either way, right?

(2) Yet "my way" means we got done with 5 /randoms instead of 12. We'd have
been done dividing up the loot in half the time if not for all the arguing...

(3) So, does anyone else do it the stupid way like me, or am I some kind
of mutant?
