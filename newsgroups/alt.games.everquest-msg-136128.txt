   I found it odd, also.  But you can ask Chris himself, and hope for an
answer.  Yep, our hero was there to twink himself by dropping stuff.  So
Chris... why the bazaar for the twinking?  And as an aside, if someone
else had picked up the stuff you dropped, would you have been okay with
that?
   Personally, if I drop twink, I am emotionally prepared to lose what I
have dropped.  I'm taking a risk, and I'm at peace with that.  Doesn't
mean I wouldn't like getting my stuff back if someone picked up, and
doesn't mean I wouldn't blacklist a character that I knew had picked up
my stuff, but really, I wouldn't start raving about it in /ooc or
/shout.  And I wouldn't ever drop something that I _really_ care about,
either.

Annie <--- Willing to bet that Chris would not have been even remotely
okay
           with someone else picking up his drop twink gear.
