Id be wearing crustacean greaves and bp before lightcrawler and
that net chiten. I'd save the chiten in a weight reducing bp or the
bank, for fire res encounters (such as nagafen) The crusty adds huge
stamina and is sold QUITE cheap for its value, by people who kill
othmirs a lot.

Alternatively, for higher AC get an enamelled black BP, 25 ac, for
about 1 k plat or less. Or cut to the chase and start saving the 5 k
plat for the best bp the least amount of money can buy- the barbed
ringmail bp which at 30 ac and 50 hp (10 str too) is planear quality
(better than old planes)

You ougrew jagged bands about 20 levels ago. I'd get the velium fire
opal rings. Most jewelers I've seen sell them for 900 plat for two, a
veritible bargain for two of the best pieces of equipment in a melee's
kit. They are 6 ac 65 hp. AC and HP are key as a melee, those have
both. ANY pieces with both (or large stamina) are the best for a
melee.

Head, ditch the lightcrawler and get a skull shaped barbute. People
sell these for 100 plat or more, dirt cheap for an okay head item
adding many HP (30 or 35, forget which) This adds more hp than a
crusty helm I think and is usually cheaper.

Belt, some kind of haste would be good. FBSS is 21 percent haste and
sells for 3 k or less now. If you get lucky, like I did, someone might
be selling a swirlspine belt cheap. I like it more than the FBSS since
it has 4 ac though its only 17 percent haste. The difference in real
speed between 17 and 21 percent is pretty moot, while the 4 ac adds
MORE to your ac than 4 even.

ERRR disregard belt, noticed later you have silver chiten handwraps,
fine for haste for now. I'd frankly not worry about the belt at all at
this point.

Wrists, no where to go there but up. Both of yours are quite dated.
Remember, AC AC AC. I'd get bracer of scavenging, 9 ac and 5 dex or a
rygorr bracer 9 ac 2 str. These are sold by other players dirt cheap.
The lightcrawler is pretty ok though at only 1 ac less. 

If you can ever get an adventureous group of level 40 or so buddies to
go there, scarlet desert in Luclin has some fantastic stuff for
everyone on mobs that are now light blue to my 56 druid. One comes off
a Grol Baku Bodyguard, a random spawn at a couple static spawn camps
around the edge of the zone (best to have some kind of tracker along,
druid, ranger or bard) I was there soon after luclin and got all my
twinks and friends a 15 ac 20 hp lore bracer, plate classes. You
really can't beat that, its better than some classes plate kunark
bracers. Both my 36 sk and 39 cleric wear one. Once at the camp its
pretty safe and higher levels hardly ever do these camps, they are
more interested in the higher level trojegs and revenants up on a
plateau. For some odd reason I had trouble selling these for 1 k plat,
its like I was talking a different language since no one had heard of
them.

Some other nice things i got at the same camp were a 4 ac 4 wis range
item- nice for clerics or druids and 15 ac spiffy looking caster robe
(on luclin models, otherwise its just tan) You find some surprising
things there and its quite random. You basically kill the shaman and
other baku until the bodyguard or other different named ones spawn,
they can spawn in any of the camp spots. There is a 4 spawn camp and a
larger 7 or so spawn one. I picked the 7 one. A druid or ranger can
easily pull the most outside ones with harmony and few other mobs
wander near the edge.

Arms: crustacean arms are far better than lightcrawler. Your kit with
the lightcrawler is fun, but you've outgrown it kind of. The stamina
on crusty arms, legs and BP would add a ton o' HP to you. Coupled with
the skull shaped barbute you'd be a much better tank. Then I'd start
saving for a barbed ringmail, not much else is worth buying for the
same great value.

Feet; guess what I'm going to say? Yep, MORE CRUSTY. These are some of
the best tank boots until you can afford much higher Ac/hp
improvements. Not only does crusty have fantastic stamina, one of the
few tank stats that matter (= HP HP HP) but each piece adds nice str
to boot.

The rest of your stuff is really okay, like the goranga idol. That is
a real good item for the money you can usually get it at.

If you really have the 2000 plat listed there, its enough to get you
started on many of the things I mentioned. Alternatively go to
www.eqtraders.com and look in the smithing areas for great armor
makeable by dwarf smiths for dwarves. This is fantastic cultural armor
with nice AC and stats very much like crustacean. perhaps you can find
a smith to give you a discount for materials hunting, or consider that
as a career for you. The very nice imbued kind does not even require a
rare gem anymore. There is now a NEW higher variety which requires a
blue diamond and comes in at an uber 51 ac bp, not trivial at 250
(max) smithing.
