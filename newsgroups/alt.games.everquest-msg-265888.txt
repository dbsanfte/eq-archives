Certainly not.

But then you never claimed that you didn't want to see irritating people
ostracized.  Copacetic Ascetic did make that claim about homosexuals, and
I'm trying to reconcile that with CA's statement about finding the
homosexual lifestyle unacceptable.

I don't see how one can have such fundamental issues with a lifestyle
as to find it unacceptable, and yet not ostracize people who practice
that lifestyle.
