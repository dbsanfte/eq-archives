I still disagree.   Never been healed for 400, only for a mob to hit you for
401 and kill you?

Ever had your warrior/tank miss a cheal by about a second?  I see it (and
its not always down to the cleric making a mistake either).   Or tryed
outhealing a dot/ae?

Extra HP healed is so obviously a positive, Im quite astonished your saying
its basically useless
