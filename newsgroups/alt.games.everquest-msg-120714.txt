>What classes get pets and at what level do they get them?

*Enchanter (first pet at level 1)
Pet is stupid and cannot be given commands. If the enchanter is hit
the pet will attack. It CANNOT be called off (unless you mesmerize the
creature after todays patch)

Magician (first pet at level 4)
Mages get 4 types of pets (listed top to bottom by melee/tanking
ability).....
Earth (casts root when it fights)
Water (casts an ice DD spell cannot be poisoned)
Air (casts a stun spell)
Fire (casts a fire DD spell and has a fire based damage shield)

Necromancer (first pet at level 1)

Beastlord (first pet at level 9)

Shaman (first pet at level 34)

Druid (pet at level 57)

*Enchanters are not dependant on thier pets, and many do not use them
at all.

>Any advice or tips? So far have played mostly Rivervale and Freeport.

If you want to get a taste of pet-class life I suggest you start a
Magician, and get him to level 4 (first pet level). Then play around
with the pet commands and practice some tactics. After you get
comfortable with basic pet commands and control, do some research and
find out which pet class fits your style of play the best (they are
all played differently)

Most common Pet commands:
/pet attack
/pet back off
/pet health report
/pet sit down
/pet guard here
/pet guard me
