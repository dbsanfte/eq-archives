Ouch, I forgot about that, too.  My pet easy soloed half the mobs we killed,
anything easy I just sicced him on and forgot about it, so it was only the
bigger mobs that I nuked at all; spending my mana on this while my friend spent
hers IFing the pet

That said, I understand the pet was taking 50% of the exp.  I was killing the
low level mobs about 10 times as fast as I had been when nuke and melee killing
them pre pet, so I can't begrudge him the 50% (ooh, exp was only coming in 5
times as fast as it was before)

Here's my proposed new hotkey, then

/g pulling %t
/cast 1
/pause 2
/cast 1
/pet attack

Where spell slot one contains Burst of Flame

That should take care of the "not doing damage to the mobs" problem, although
I'll have to worry about mana more since I'll be spending some every mob.

Splendid, 5 mage, Firiona Vie
