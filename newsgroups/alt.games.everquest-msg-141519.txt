 For (some) Luclin raids RGC is rather helpful to have. If you don't do
many of those, you'd probably do fine with Remove Curse which drops from
the big shroom in EC and does the same thing RGC does except that you
have to cast it three times. (Or two.  I can't remember at the moment.)

 This usually drops 2-3 times on any Tunare raid. More than likely you
can probably get it for nothing if you're friendly with one of the
guilds that clears PoG and ask nicely.
