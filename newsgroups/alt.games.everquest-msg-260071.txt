I logged in my mage for a minute or two and can confirm the problem; 
could duck out of spells normally, could not duck out of spells while 
running the eye.  Clicking off the eye allowed me to duck out of a spell 
started with the eye on.

Was, of course, too bleary from just waking up to actually think to test 
the autoduck autosit things or otherwise play around with the interface 
trying to fix this, which might well after all be a "feature" as I can't 
swear I was able to duck spells while on the eye before.
