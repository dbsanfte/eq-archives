LOL! And that is different from the status quo how?
Verant is always making changes that take months or
even years to get fixed. So what else is new?

You really must be playing a different game than the rest of us.
Calling us fanboys is the icing on the cake, more than half the
people responding in this thread I have seen whipping Verant
at the post many times, VAKS they are not.

Besides what changes are they making that will 'take months to get fixed?'
New graphics models and textures? Yeah that could really screw things up
like a new coat of paint. New zones and quests? Yeah we all know what a flop
the last 2 expansions were. Adding horses? Yeah all that horse manure is
really going to stink up the game. Adding more abilities for post level 50s?
Yeah giving players more ways to add to their characters could be dangerous.
Changing melee damage and resists post 50? Yeah that's horrible they have
never done that before LOL!
