Ain't that the damndest thing?  I used to have the *worst* dang sound
problems with win2k and my SB PCI 512 (quite similar to a SB Live).
Running DX8.  About a month or so ago, I updated my Geforce2 MX vid
drivers to whatever the latest WHQL version was, and oddly enough my
sound has DRAMATICALLY improved.  Still the stutter from time to time
(every 15 minutes or so?) but the overall sound balance works and the
EAX stuff is now working as well.

I'm basically crossing my fingers and trying to avoid installing
anything that might change that...  :-)   

oh yeah, my point:  I have no point.  <wink>  There are so many
inter-related factors that I've completely given up on trying to
diagnose this stuff under win2k!!  I used to consider myself a pretty
handy guy, but this is just too much for me.
