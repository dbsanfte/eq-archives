It demands attention, it signfies urgency. Its the emergency broadcast 
system of Everquest.

It should be used to announce trains, to announce the arrival of a 
hostile guild (in a pvp zone/game/server), possibly for critical issues 
on a raid. And other things of import to the people in the area.

It is *not* an emergency that your KEI ran out. Or that you'd like a 
cleric to join you on a 30th level LDoN run. Or that your selling your 
cloak. Or that your guild is recruiting.

/agreed. that's what /ooc was /visioned for

Nope. We have a channel for that. /auction is where you -should- be 
requesting or offering goods and services, including rezzes, keis, 
ports, guilds, and groups.

/auction has the same affect of being a zone wide plea without the 
overtones of CODE RED EMERGENCY PANIC TIME!! that go with /shout.

/ooc and /auction are the same colour by default. Putting them at the 
same importance level. Its merely convention that /ooc is so dominant 
for all chatter... possibly because /auction was the same color and took 
longer to type out. (at least it follows that rule that you should never 
attribute to malice what can be explained by laziness.)

When was the last time your car broke down and you needed a little help 
that you walked into a crowed space and then at the top of your lungs 
belted out:

HEY! ANYBODY WANT TO COME BOOST MY CAR?
HEY! ANYBODY WANT TO COME BOOST MY CAR?
HEY! ANYBODY WANT TO COME BOOST MY CAR?
...
...
...
CAN SOMEBODY COME BOOST MY CAR!!

In the woods at least you might should because you actually need to be 
heard. In EQ /auction is plenty 'loud' enough to get your message 
accross the zone efficiently without using the emergency broadcast 
system.

Agreed. Use /auction.

/shout is red for important/emergency. It bugs people when other people 
think their slightest inconvience is a zonewide emergency.

Me, I've configured shout to be grey. I don't usually notice them.
