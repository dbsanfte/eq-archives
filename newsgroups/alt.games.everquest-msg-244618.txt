Someone who's gotten to 60+ on Torv and not figured out that my guild
tag means that I have a raiding priority. I try not to get involved in
LDoN if I know raiding time is getting close, but it's the nature of
the beast that such things can not always be predicted.

Most of the people I'm potentially wasting the time of are doing the
same to me. More than half the players I regularly group with are also
in raiding guilds, often the same ones we're racing for targets with.
