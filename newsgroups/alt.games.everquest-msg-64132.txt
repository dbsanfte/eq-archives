I have been trying to log in to EQ to see if Luclin runs now that I
have installed it. the little patching window pops up, but then I get
a message to the effect of "could not establish a connection. Please
check your network connection or contact eqtech@soe.sony.com"

What the heck is going on? I have also noticed that I cannot get
Netscape to work while this is happening if I click on netscape after
I click on EQ. Can anyone help me?
