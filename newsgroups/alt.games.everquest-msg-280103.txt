Maybe, but they're still reasons why people quit the game.

Of course - some people will whine about anything.

See answer above.   It wasn't a "big problem" - it was a limitation.
People don't like limitations.

> Notice, the term was "dependance", not some casual vs. raider debate.

Which is why I asked what you meant - and you didn't answer.  Do
you have to have gear?  Well, yeah.  Do you have to raid for it?
No.  Do you have to group for it?  No.   Is a level 50 more powerful
than a level 20?  Well, yeah.   Can the level 50 kill a level 22 mob
that drops the Item of Uberness easier than a level 20?  Sure - but
the level 20 will get the drop, the level 50 won't.   Levels and gear
matter in EQ2 - but only as rewards for investment in the game.
They're not critical the same way they are in EQ.   So, again, I'm
not sure of the point here.

Well, let's follow the thread:

You:   Sony had the truly idiotic idea that to avoid losing their existing
playerbase to WoW (among other competitors) they had to do
something (the something turned out to be EQ2).

Me:  They DID have to do something.

I'll stick by that statement:  SOE would have been insane not to do
SOMETHING to respond to threats by WoW (and Vanguard and
anyone else developing competing products.  The EQ product is an
old product and was losing subscribers *prior* to WoW's release.
I can't see how a fantasy offering not in Norrath would have been
better nor how a team with SWG's success could have done another
genre any better.  Just upgrading EQ wasn't the solution - EQ would
have it's own baggage to defeat.

Frankly I find the idea that someone with a product as successful as
EQ shouldn't leverage off that success on a new offering boggling...
