hyphens are not allowed.  Apostrophe's are, and you have to petition for it.

however, per the naming rules:



All the same rules apply to your surname. Further, the combination of names
cannot violate any of the guidelines set forth in the Naming Policy. For
example, the name Absolute, when combined with the surname Vodka, violates
Naming Policy. Similarly, names such as Merr Linn, Belg Erath, Sylvester
Stallone, Klee Necks, etc. are all unacceptable.

although the naming policy seems to be going out the window and GM's don't
really give a flying fuck about it anymore....at least the one's I've
petitioned they don't.
