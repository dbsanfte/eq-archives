I must be missing something.  You need to be visible to get the shard,
but you can be ported while invisible, right?

So you run to the Scion invis, drop invis, get shard, re-invis, run
to zone boundary (or close to Thurgadin if you're more comfortable
there), wait for the one-minute warning, then run back to the spires
invisible and wait for the port.

No?
