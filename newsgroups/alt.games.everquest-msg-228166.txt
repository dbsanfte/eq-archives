/agree.  This is not about whether or not a GM can intervene. 
I would not have such a person in *my* guild, nor would I group with them.  No,
your guildmate didn't do anything against the *law*.  He just did something
underhanded, dirty, and deceitful.  And he did it on purpose, and then boasts
about it to the whole guild, so you all are *in* on his dirty little secret. 
What a winner you have in your midst.  Aren't you the lucky guild?  *IF* you
*call* him on it, I bet he offers to donate the proceeds to the guild bank,
thereby making you all guilty of his actions.  
I can just picture him yelling "but I'm INNOCENT".  He's not.  He's the *most*
guilty kind.
