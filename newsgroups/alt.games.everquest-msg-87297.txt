There is another little trick you can try if you have the skill.
Use sneak and then use trainer.  I did that with my Vah Shir Beastlord
in FV.  That Barbarian Trainer was dubious to me and sneak worked.

Of course, make sure you are out of sight of them before turning on
sneak, otherwise it won't work.  They should con indifferent to you
with sneak on, unless your just totally KoS.
