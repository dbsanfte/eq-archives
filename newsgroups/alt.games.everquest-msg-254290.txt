As the cleric I would have asked who had the best AC and most HP's and
designated THAT person as MT as soon as I realized there was a mana problem. 
This is just so *not fun* of a situation to be in.  Especially if the warrior
couldn't keep agro.  She values her life.
My level 26 warrior would ask the question himself, if there were other tank
types in the group.  He may be a male barbarian but he still has a brain :)
My ranger would just wait quietly in the background and wait until advised.  
(FWIW, my cleric has been in level 65 groups where the MT *was* a ranger and
hardly *ever* needed healing.  And she's been in groups where the warrior
requires 2 complete heals every round.)

I think it's important too, and I would designate it as someone's job if they
didn't figure it out themselves.
