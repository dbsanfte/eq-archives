So therefore you whould have nothing to do with the Warrior, doing
your absolute best to ensure that he remains a "have not" forever.
You're playing up in the nosebleed section Martin.  But that's not

Well sure, but that's not particularly similar to a pickup group
involving a Warrior lo enough that he hasn't yet ditched his Wurm
out of embarassment.  Especially the "with my guild" part, with
the obvious implication that one of the items on the agenda (long

the Warlord so he <can> hold agro when the Monks are going full out.
