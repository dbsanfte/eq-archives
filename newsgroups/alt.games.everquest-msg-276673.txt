Bummer, now I am sad. Funny you mentioned Linux on the second box. I was 
thinking of doing that do as something to do with that PC. I ran Linux 
exclusively on my main PC for a year and played what games I could using 
WineX, which I guess is now called Cedega. I was a subscriber and could play 
things like CS, various shooters, etc. back then. Around the time they 
started supporting EQ, I went back to Windows for a variety of reasons, not 
the least of which was that I personally felt that the quality of the KDE 
Linux desktop and the apps available for it was just not quite ready for 
primetime and every day use in the home setting. That's my take after 
dealing with a few crashes too many of all kinds of apps constantly evolving 
and to varying degrees of beta quality in my estimation. But I think I'd 
like it fine for something to play with in a separate sandbox and this PC 
will let me do that. These days, I think I'd go Mandrake again or maybe 
SuSE.
