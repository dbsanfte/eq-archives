Well, I'm neither any kind of counsellor, nor I think you need one, but... 
Your experience is nothing out of the ordinary. Life *is* basically a 
cocktail of tedium and odium with the occasional bubble of reduced 
suckage, but that's precisely the way it's supposed to be. After all, 
Sturgeon's Law states that 90% of everything is shit, and it applies to 
life as well as to everything else.

On the other hand, even if they are just polka dots in a dull background, 
I find that things such as (in no particular order) Bruckner symphonies, 
Terry Pratchett novels, mushrooms, C.D. Friedrich paintings, Coen 
Brothers movies, sex, computer games, Art Nouveau, Usenet, chewing the 
fat with friends, coffee, calling your family from the other side of the 
world, the Grand Canyon, Fortean Times magazine, science fiction, the 
streets of Lincoln (Lincolnshire, not Nebraska), beautiful faces, the 
skies at sunset after a stormy day, San Francisco, Everquest, The Lord 
of the Rings, oranges, Italian food, Aston Martins, Bruce Springsteen, 
laughing, Iain Banks novels, saturdays, every issue of New Scientist, 
Brahms, etc. (And it's a hell of a big etcetera, as you can imagine) 
more than make up for having to go through the motions between those 
moments.

And those moments happen to everybody in pretty much equal measure (
barring, perhaps, extreme poverty or massive disability), you just got 
to go through life with your eyes open, and realize when you are having 
one. I think that every single one of them justifies having been alive, 
and on the aggregate, yay for the sperm that won the race! :)
