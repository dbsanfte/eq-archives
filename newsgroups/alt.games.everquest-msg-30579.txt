Not a bitch... but I love the fact that there is an assumption that all will
know what CoM is...
I for one dont know what CoM is, and was wondering if you could bestow that
knowledge on me.

I see it in a large amount of posts... lookinfor my SBSS?
GEB?.. etc... whish someone would be kind enough somewhere in the post to
give the meaning for it...

i.e  LOIO (lake of ill omen), GF (Greater Faydark), GD (Great Divide)....
etc...

Your time is appreciated..
