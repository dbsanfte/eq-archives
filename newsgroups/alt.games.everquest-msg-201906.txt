I grouped my monk with a Cleric and Necro once and
the Necro cast a Spell that stacked with the Cleric's Mark or Karn
and Mark of Retribution line of spells.

I looked through the Necro spells and I didn't see it.

Anyone have any clue what this spell was?

It may have been an effect from an item I am not sure.
