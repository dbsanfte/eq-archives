Ok, don't flame on this one.  I am not a hacker and I personally do not like
the EQ hacker crowd since they force VI to go out of their way to protect us
from ourselves.

I know that I have seen references to EQWindows and the ability to run EQ in
a window.  I seem to be fat fingering either the ctrl+esc (my autoattack is
ctrl+`) or the windows key when hitting ctrl.  It seems that before the last
patch EQ filtered for the windows key, but now it runs.  I can go back to
the desktop and EQ still runs, but I cannot tab back in.  I have to kill the
process, go link dead, and hope that something was not in the mood to kill
me.

I know that a few friends can tab in and out of EQ with no problems, but
they are not running Win2k.

So, to make a short question long.....

Does EQWindows (or DXWindows) work and is it something that can get you
banned?  If EQ just exited and killed the app then I guess I could live with
that, but I can still hear the sounds in the background, so it appears that
EQ is still running fine.  Win2k is not as easy with disabling the system
keys, so writing an app would be difficult to do.  I am sure that I can
really dig to find one, but with a 21" monitor a windowed EQ would be nice
to have.

Thanks in advance.

Brian
