If this has already been done, forgive me, but...

I'm just curious to find out what the split is.  Not that this
newsgroup is representative of the EQ community as a whole, but the
results might still be mildly interesting.

Feel free to say why you feel the way you do, but to keep things
simple let's say that you can either have *all* the new models or *no*
new models.  No "well, I'll keep the ogre but ditch the dark elf"
stuff.  Oh and also, this is purely aesthetics.  "I don't like the new
models cause they gank my frame rate on raids" is irrelevant for the
purposes of this poll.

So (for the ogres and trolls) YES means you prefer the new models, NO
means you prefer the older models.

I'll start.  NO.  IMO the new models were created by a misogynist, and
a not very talented one at that.

Anyone wanna play?
