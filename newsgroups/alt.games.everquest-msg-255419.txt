	By reaching level 39? :-)

	No kidding, really, my cleric started to get pickup raid
invites at about oh level 50.  I'd get to the form up spot, find
out who the MT was, get the cheal rotation in the cleric channel,
then follow the raid in and wait for my turn to cast.  BFD, and one
reason I came to hate raiding.

	I've been 65 for a while now, and for the most part the raids
I've been on follow that same pattern, although now I sometimes get 
to use RC or spam fast heals too :-) Maybe raiding is different for
truly uber clerics?
