Last Halloween, there were far more people in every forum I looked at
annoyed about the events than enjoying them. Besides that, EQ is only
a couple of weeks into a brand new expansion. Application of Occam's
Razor would certainly imply that one or both of those factors played
into a more subdued Halloween rather than the desire to kill off SOE's
biggest cash cow in favor of years-away vaporware.

Might want to request a bigger dose next time.
