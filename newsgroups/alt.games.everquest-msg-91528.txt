I actually like the Corpse run. I played DAoC when you die you can live 
with it, its not a great deal - unless you are in a hunt and the pain 
aspect. You die in EQ it is a big deal so you tend to be more careful 
and when nearing death situations the game doesn't half become an 
andrenlin rush.

If you don't like Corpse runs go with DAoC the only point in DAoC is to 
gain back some xp - but you can never go down a level in DAoC so it 
should suit you.

Nice and easy world as well - no I should go down there ;)
