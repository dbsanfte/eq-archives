No, they explicitly stated that there would be some copies available
on CDs because people who played using Game Cards wouldn't be able to
purchase LoY any other way.  The way you registered for it was to
simply charge it to the card you use to make your regular subscription
payments, rather than have you fill out all sorts of order info that
they already had on you.

Granted, some if not most game card subscibers may have a credit card
they could use to purchase LoY, but a significant minority of their
playerbase would probably be left without the opportunity to purchase
it if they hadn't made the hard copies available.  That's hardly fair
to them.
