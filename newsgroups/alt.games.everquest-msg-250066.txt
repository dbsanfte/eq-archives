Anyone who seriously thinks that the only things that
were discussed at the summit were guild issues is being
needlessly sceptical, and just because a list of issues got
passed round the dinnertable and typed up on the web,
and it HAPPENS to be a response to the majority of
people that were at the summit, it doesn't mean that is
all you are going to see.

Take a look at this thread on GUcomics' forums from
Woody.

"The list that you're seeing is only the TIP of the
"immediately address" iceberg. You have to remember
that the most represented segment of the game at the
summit was the higher end guilds. So, the ten hottest
topics were related to what they said. But, I can also
tell you that they heard the pleas to address casual
gamer concerns loud and clear.

There's a LOT happening. A WHOLE lot more than
JUST that abbreviated list. I promise you."
