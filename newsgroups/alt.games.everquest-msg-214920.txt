What you mention does make sence. There are always different tactics you can use to bring down bazaar price but unfortunatly it doens't always work. Me being someone that has a full time trader loged in on a second account I can tell you that it all depends on how fast I want to sell soemthing. If I want 7k for a spell for example, depending on demand on how much PP i need I will keep it at that price untill it sells. Take Funural Pyre for example. On A-Ro it goes for around 40-50k. The problem is that it drops only in one zone from 2 mobs. (even the research components are very rare) with that said I can keep that price of 40-50k for as long as it takes untill it sells. 

So basicly what I'm saying is even if there were 3 more traders that got the spell and marked it below what I was going to sellit for I wouldn't lower the price due to the rarity of the spell. Once the 3 new traders sell their copy mine will still sale for 40-50k. It all comes down to how much time the sell has.
