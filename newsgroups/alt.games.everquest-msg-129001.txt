He's quite correct, you simply need to downgrade your firmware.  Go to
ftp://ftp.linksys.com/pub/befsr41/BEFSR41_VN_FW1402.zip to downgrade. 
I'm currently working with Linksys to resolve the problem, they're
having me beta test the firmware, it takes 2 hours now, then it
disconnects every 30 minutes, so we're getting closer ;).
