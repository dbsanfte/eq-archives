Does the problem occur only in certain zones?

Try deleting the files for one of the affected zones and then EQ will 
automatically dowbload the missing files. I will lay money that will cure 
it. I have had a similair problem in the past in Butcher Block where the 
dwarfs were replaced by the default human model. I deleted the BB files and 
re-downloaded them and everything was fine.
