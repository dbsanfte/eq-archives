Thanks for the replies.  I got it working. It turned out to be the new video
driver. I went back and removed the old driver and THEN installed the
upgrade driver. Don't install an upgrade over the old driver. Completely
remove the old driver then reboot and install the new driver.
Then I went into the EQ directory and deleted the client.exe and logged back
on.
