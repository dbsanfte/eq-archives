I had to get 2 books from Hate before I sucessfully finished the quest
(failed once on the General)  The first time I got the book during a
raid, the second time solo.  Getting it solo is very doable as long as
you have an idea of the mobs to watch out for, their pathing, and the
location of the book.  I'm glad I decided to get it solo the second
time around because it is by far one of the most rewarding EQ
experiences, and a great test of stealth.

A raid isn't that bad of an idea either if you're unfamiliar with the
zone or want to pick up some Woven Shadow armor.
