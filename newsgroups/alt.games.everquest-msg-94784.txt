A week or so ago, I saw someone running and an Orc chasing them. I
clicked on the Orc, it had full hit points so I thought perhaps it
agrro'ed on the guy and he couldn't handle it, hence he was running
and since I was close, I attacked it. The other player never said
anything.

Later I started thinking and wondered if the person was pulling it to
a group (though I saw no groups anywhere around the area.)

If the guy couldn't handle it and was actually running away, I helped,
cool.

On the other hand, assuming the guy was pulling, did I KS or was it
just a simple mistake?

Just curious, thanks in advance.
