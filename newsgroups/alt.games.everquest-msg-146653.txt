I remember that crock, Luckily I have the Prenerf ships, and oh my the Viper
launch station with those mini vipers that shot out under rubber band or
spring loaded action... /auction 2k each lol. There was a similar thing with
a series of transformer type toys, MechaNauts or something? One of you will
probably remember the exact name. They had small action figures and various
bots and vehicles that interchanged. One even had wings that removed to form
the infamous projectile guns that some fool choked on. They were fun and as
stated could teach you alot.
