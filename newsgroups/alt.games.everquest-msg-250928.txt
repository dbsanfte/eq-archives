And you think selling designer cocaine out of a walmart is good idea??

'long term use over time'?? Most kids don't really look much past 
tomorrow... a message like that isn't going have any impact. Its not 
because those kids are 'stupid'... they just don't have that long-view 
perspective. They aren't going to care about a message of doom & gloom 
that will effect them 10 years down the road.

Maybe your firends and neighbours. Mine aren't trafficking crack.

Can. Not does. And they need a warrant.

I seriously doubt any law enforcement agencies are tracking my spending.

They'll be just as nasty if you legalize drugs... they'll just deal 
something else. They aren't going to suddenly become all warm and fuzzy 
if you legalize heroine.

Perhaps you haven't seen what some of those drugs do to your grey 
matter? Perhaps you haven't seen the effect addiction can have on 
people, their friends, and their families??
