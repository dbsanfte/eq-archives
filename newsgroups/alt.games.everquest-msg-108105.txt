Err guys a five dollar pair of regular 3D glasses gives an amazing
improvement in 3D effect and I can see the keyboard just fine. No
hardware to install, no software to glitch up EQ, and easy to
uninstall if I dont like it, just take em off. Sounds simplistic but
hey its 5 bucks. Dont knock it till you try it.
