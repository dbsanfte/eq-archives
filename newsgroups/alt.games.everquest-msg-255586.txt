I think WoW will be made for the masses, and be quite an easy game, and
therefore boring and uninspirational.  I could well be wrong, will have to
see when it comes out, right now, its hard to see anything for all the hype.

Vanguard actually sounds like it has a challenge, corpse recoverys etc are a
GOOD thing.  It makes you not want to die, which in turn brings you closer
to your in game avatar and will make you a better player.

YMMVï¿½
