Its a matter of style and group composition,with my regular
group of War,SK,Enc,Dru,Cle(me) we very rarely have 
unwanted adds,single mobs are going down so fast,that
the  MT has around 80% health left when fight is over,so
I toss a celestial healing on him,I can hardly see my mana
bar move.
Of course you are right,would be more effective to let his
health drop to 40 or so.
I think it makes the group feel better,when they look at the health
bars and see 100% on everyone than let the MTs health 
hovering around 50 or 60 for several fights.
I know I dont like the Cheal tactic very much with my pally,
always makes me a little nervous.
