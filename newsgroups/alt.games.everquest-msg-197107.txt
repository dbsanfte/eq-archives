Good points.  But they'll just learn the hard way when they hit level 10 and
die with consequences.  Hopefully, the lesson won't be too painful and they
won't actually lose their corpse with all their possessions.  I remember a
couple times way back in beta and when the servers first went live where I
lost my corpse in places I had no business being and couldn't get it back
because nobody could rez or summon corpse at that point.  It was painful but
also kinda fun 'cause I was seeing thing most others had not.  Of course, I
then had to get new gear.  :(
