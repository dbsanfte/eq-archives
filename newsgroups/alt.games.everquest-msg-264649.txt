Way back in the musty days of summer, one of the things we were 
speculating about regarding EQ2 was the inclusion of lots of voiced 
material for the NPCs.

At the time, I said that if there was voice only content that this would 
be a game killer for me; I play with the sound off, which for EQ means I 
miss out on a few cue's as to mob movement out of my line of sight, but 
not much else.  If I -have- to listen to the game in order to be able to 
do quests etc, then its right out.

Perhaps I've missed it, but I haven't seen anyone say whether the voices 
in EQ2 are mandatory, or just background and the occaisional echo of 
written text.  I mean, if there's a voice actor reading aloud the stuff 
thats showing up in the dialog box, I won't care since I won't have to 
listen, what with the sound on my speakers being turned off and all.
