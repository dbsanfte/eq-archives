    It won't eliminate this quest, or any other already in game. The Warrens
loot rules are being applied on a going-forward basis, to all *future*
zones. All zones already in game will stay as they are. There's FAR too many
quests and mobs with neat drops (Guano Harvester in Sol B) that would have
to be changed otherwise.

    Like I said, nothing will be eliminated. However, all FUTURE quests will
have to be designed carefully, and I just don't think they're up to that
task. Look at how flawed Velious was when it came out - incomplete zones,
totally slanted faction choices, drop tables out of whack all over the
place, and a slew of quests that had to be changed because they hadn't been
thought through. I doubt anything will change in SoL.
