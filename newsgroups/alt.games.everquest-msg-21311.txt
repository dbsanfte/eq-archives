This is too funny not to share.  All credit goes to Yasheka who posted it 
on the Everlore Boards

Necromancer Spells

Quake (level 51): This spell minimizes the Everquest program, and launches 
a scaled-down version of Quake for the necro to play while waiting at a 
zone line for a raid to fail.

Duracell (level 44): Turns the necromancer into a battery-like object that 
other players can simply click on to receive an infusion of mana.


Enchanter Spells

Suicide (level 51): Debuff of a target�s magic resistance with 
instantaneous reduction of all the enchanter�s hit points. This spell is 
used when an enchanter does not wish to waste time getting summoned and 
slain after a typical tash. Instead, the enchanter just accepts the 
inevitable, and self-terminates immediately.

Illusion Warrior (level 44): On those intense Velious raids against magic 
resistant targets, allows the enchanter to at least "appear" to be 
something more than a buff-bitch.


Magician Spells

Join Companion (level : The opposite of Summon Companion, this spell 
transports a magician to his pet after it has wandered away and picked up a 
train to fight. The magician can easily join the pet in a glorious death 
without causing a train to kill the rest of the group. (note: the spell 
only works if the pet is currently fighting something)

Repulsion of the Jerk (Level 55): The inverse of call of the hero, this 
spell transports a targeted group member as far away from you as possible, 
and instead of clearing their aggro it adds the person to the hate list of 
everything in the zone.


Cleric Spells

Taunt (level 20): This spell increases a target�s aggressiveness toward the 
cleric. It is intended to be used when things are going smoothly and the 
cleric is getting bored.

Death Touch (level 59): Mobs can do it, now players can too! Death touch 
allows a cleric to instantly kill any target...useable once per level 
starting at level 59.


Rangers Spells

Spirit of Robin (level 1): For roleplay purposes only, this transforms the 
ranger to look like Robin Hood, complete with tights and feather-in-hat. It 
makes the ranger KoS to everything...including other player characters.


Wizard Spells

Ice Planetoid (level 60): An upgrade to ice comet, this planetoid of ice 
will deliver 100,000 points of damage to everything in the current 
zone...including the caster and all other players. Costs 2000 mana, 
consumes a blue diamond as a component, and has a 10-day recast time.

Taxi (level 34): This spell turns the wizard bright yellow with the word 
TAXI printed on his robe. While the spell is up, all transportation spells 
require half as much mana, and the player will automatically spam the zone 
with an offer to teleport anyone, anywhere, anytime.


Shaman Spells

Canabalize Other (level 55): Finally, shamans will be able to canabalize 
any other players to gain mana. Removes 500 hit points from the targeted 
player and gives the shaman back 250 mana.
