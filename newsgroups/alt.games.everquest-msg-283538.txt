Hmm, I think I had my druid try camo on the undead in Misty Thicket, 
where I was testing this, and they saw thru it.  Now I'm not certain I 
actually did check, though, I know they didn't see thru Hide.  Bah, 
going to log in and see, back in a few minutes.

Wow, you are right, standard Camo worked on them too.  Thats messed up.
