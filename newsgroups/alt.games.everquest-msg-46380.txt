There have been no cases of smallpox in the last ten years that cannot 
be traced to a known laboratory stock.

There is an anthrax vaccine of dubious effectiveness.  It is illegal to 
administer to civilians in the USA since it has not passed FDA safety 
trials.  The smallpox vaccine has not been manufactured for quite a long 
time.

Gas masks?????

Tell us another fairy tale, Junior.  Gas masks don't mean diddly-doo.  
You have already be WEARING the thing BEFORE the attack.  THAT is how 
fast modern agents work.  Second, they also give pretty much zero 
protection against several modern agents that insinuate through the 
skin.  If anything, gas masks will erode public safety, since they will 
do nothing better than give a false sense of security.  Buying a gas 
mask against modern nerve agents is as effective as wearing hockey pads 
against high-velocity rifle rounds.

You can read them while you die.  If you don't have an injector of 
neurotoxin antidote on hand (usually an acetycholinesterase of some 
sort--my lab has been working on mass producing acetylcholinesterase for 
a few years) and know how to use it, no amount of literature will help 
you.

Atropine??????  Your information is about a decade out of date.

Ciproxin is no thrill to take, but it's better than dying or losing body 
parts (says the guy who took it last month and got to keep his foot).

There is no accepted _B. anthracis_ vaccine for civilian use.  Likewise, 
there is no real _Y. pestis_ vaccine to speak of.  There are plans to 
bulk up on the most hopeful candidates, but it's been hard going for 
labs to get funding for it (says the guy in a lab that has been trying 
to get funding for it for a couple of years).

You just keep telling yourself that.  Those of us interested in reality 
already know that they won't do a thing unless worn before exposure and 
won't work against many toxic agents at all.  You willing to live the 
rest of your life in a baggie?  That's the only way to "protect" 
yourself against modern nerve agents.

First, stop capitalizing the names of diseases.  Believe it or not, they 
are NOT Divine Beings.  There is no anthrax vaccine available for 
civilian use, and the military isn't even confident in what they have.  
The smallpox vaccine has not been produced for at least a decade--get 
friendly with some dairy cows if it really bothers you so much.

And if you feel like getting a feathered rattle and shouting "OOGA

Peace of mind based on false premises is worse than fear.

Lemme guess--you don't live where there's any snow, right?  That's 
pretty much par for the course here.

Bad news, Junior, "nuclear events" occur many times a second at nuclear 
power plants.

The problem is that your reactions are based entirely upon having no 
understanding at all of the threat.  FEMA documents are not much good in 
this regard.  You lay out your money for gas masks that will turn out to 
be useless unless you already have PRIOR warning of any gas attack--and 
even then may not work.  You look for vaccines that either don't exist 
or aren't even known to work in the first place.

"Survival books", by and large, are useless and based on macho 
fantasies--you'll get better knowledge from ordinary boy scout training.  
What you recommend "stockpiling" is pretty much ordinary for anybody who 
lives somewhere the weather tends to get nasty.  I expect to get 
completely snowed in one year out of three, and I live downtown.  
Alarmism like yours does nothing to help.

Congratulations--the terrorists have defeated you.  If you give them 
THAT much power, then they have already destroyed you.

Then why are you fomenting panic and advocating measures that will be 
ineffective?  Could YOU be part of those who wish to spread terror in 
America?
