Guards do not normally attack other intelligent races they share a zone
with. There are a few cases I know of it happening but it's not been to help
another player.
Holly Windstalker (and the late great Cros Treewind) would attack the Qeynos
Guards in QHills if they saw them kill a wolf (and get ripped a new one,
Nash and Leopold are not far shy of Sgt Slate) and I even saw druids against
druids at the rings in NK. A player waiting for group to port sat down and
was aggro'd by a bear...the druids then aggro'd on him (as happens) BUT the
named ones (Tak Whistler to be precise) did not...until one of the druids
cast an AoE spell that hit him, then he tore into the
druids...unfortuanately we ported before I could see the result of that
fight but not fast enough to save the lazy halfling.

So, no, Guards do not help you with "Human" mobs. The Dark Elf Bridge guards
will not kill the halflings in Nekulos and the WK guards will not kill the
bandits.
