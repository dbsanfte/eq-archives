VI has said that the upcoming changes to these weapons would be
retroactive... implying that after the patch, I get to log on, and my
Soulfire would suddenly be different.

Interesting that they can (and will) make instant and retroactive changes
(read: NERF) without much difficulty, but if you have an item that is being
changed in a helpfull manner you typically have to cntact a GM in-game to
get it changed...
