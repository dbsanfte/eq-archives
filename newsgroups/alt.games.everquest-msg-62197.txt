Most of the time the popup asking if it should be allowed is not visible,
and almost impossible to get to in order to tell zone alarm to allow access.
It got annoying enough that I added ZoneAlarm to my list of things to
shutdown before starting EQ.   But then, I am running through a Netgear
hub/router that takes care of most of my firewall issues already.

OTOH, I have found Win2K to be rock solid with EQ, I have never had a lock
up problem.  I have had issues with drivers, but that is all straightened
out.  I do not have windows keys on my keyboard anymore, so that's not an
issue.  As for the LD causing death, well, they didn't want to allow people
to just disconnect their modems to avoid death anytime it looked likely they
would die.  I have had two LD deaths in the approximately one year I've been
playing, not really a major issue for me.
