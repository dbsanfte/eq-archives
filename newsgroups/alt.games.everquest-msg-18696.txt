Here is where it all started.  Basically, someone saw/heard about/dreamed up
a bunch of unconnected facts, and tried to form them into some huge pattern:

Unfortunately, there was no pattern to arrange them in - they really are
unconnected facts.

In looking for the source, I also found a debunking.  The originator is
still in denial:

Welcome to Usenet.  First a few questions:
Do you have an inferiority complex?
Do you feel that people persecute you?  Are you an idiot?
Can you stand your ground without sounding helpless?
