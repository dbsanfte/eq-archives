If you are talking about a father of three who actually *sacrifices* 
his life for a complete stranger, I won't pretend I understand the 
motivation, unless perhaps it's for a child (making sacrifices for 
children is something we're strongly wired to do). If you are talking 
about a father of three who *risks* his life for a stranger, in spite 
of a possible outcome of death, this is perfectly consistent with a 
hedonistic attitude, and something probably most of us would do without 
a second thought.

As I mentioned in the previous post, an ethical hedonist will try to 
maximize pleasure for all around them (this is not just ethics... if 
you have been gifted with any amount of empathy, giving pleasure *is* 
pleasure), and so it follows that, death being the end of pleasure, 
they will try to protect the lives of others, even to the extent of 
risking theirs. Besides, having to live with the memory of having stood 
by when someone else was at risk is far from pleasurable. All in all, 
the possible pleasure derived from the deed itself is perhaps the least 
significant factor.
