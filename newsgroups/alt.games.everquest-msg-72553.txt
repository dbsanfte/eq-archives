Might also mention that druid melee skills cap at 175, that fear
kiting (especially in high teens) is the perfect time to work on melee
skills, and that root dotting is a perfectly acceptable alternative to
kiting once you get ensnaring roots.

Then again, I grouped with a level 60 druid the other day who needed
to be told what the Ro debuffs did.
