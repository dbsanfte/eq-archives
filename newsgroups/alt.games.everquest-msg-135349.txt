Let me ask you a serious question...


Let's assume, for a moment, that the choice of being gay is truly a
choice.  I believe it is, you may not.  But for the sake of this
question, let's assume it is..

Now, a gay person CHOOSES to be gay, even though he or she knows that
there will be discrimination.  They know that there may even be
violence against them and their friends and family.  They know that
there may be attacks perpatrated on themselves and their friends and
family.

Now, knowing all that they know....  Don't they share some
responsibility for those attacks?  It can be argued that, since they
KNEW it was a possibility, then the threats and attacks are partially
their fault...


Comments??
