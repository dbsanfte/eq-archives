Yeah. It's the one class I have avoided in a year and a half in this
game. Mostly, I think, from the fear of carpal tunnel. But I have a good
connection, and I'm seriously thinking my next character on Innoruuk is
going to be a bard. Can't decide on a race, though.

The leezard is doing well, if I could just get 2HS maxed out with this
Cazic cursed Fine Steel, slower than crap weapon I picked up. But I must
say, Kurn's Tower is amazing for leveling.  My gnome enchanter is
languishing for lack of interest in dying every few minutes. *sigh*.

Bards, bards, bards. I'm almost tempted to pick human just to be weird.
