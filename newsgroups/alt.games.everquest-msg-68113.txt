  Beastlords are a hybrid/melee class, not a healer or magi class.
This is evidenced by the fact that they receive their first set of
spells at level 9, just like shadow knights, paladins and rangers, who
also, by the way, don't learn Gate or Bind Affinity.  Beastlords are
to shamans as rangers are to druids.
