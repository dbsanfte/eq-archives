It's been a long time since I played my iksar but I believe you can buy
leather class armor (rhino hide?) from a vendor in Cabalis. I also believe
iksar cannot wear plate class armor.

As a newbie, I hunted along the path to the Pit.  When those greened out I
hunted the area to the left of the Pit (outside).  Next I hunted in the Pit
starting the end closest to the city and working my way to the other end
(Kurn's Tower) as I leveled up.  You can start Kurn's at around 12-13.
