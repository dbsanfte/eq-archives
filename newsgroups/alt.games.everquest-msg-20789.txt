nothing to do with distance, true, but everything to do with the number of
hops the data has to make.

Since most times the ip packets seem to pass through london, before crossing
the atlantic, then wander around the US for a while before arriving at their
destination, placing a server in London would half the number of hops, thus
reducing the chance that one of those hops happens to be a slow transfer.

Of course, if the slow hop happens to be this side of the Atlantic, which it
probably would be, then it would make no difference where the servers were
after that.
