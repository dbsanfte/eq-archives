I wasn't here when that was the case, but I do recall the other point of
putting LD in was for players not to do the /q or pulling the plug to avoid
a fubar they brough upon themselves, to avoid getting killed in the process
as well as clearing agro.  I also know that according to their
reimbursement policy that was posted, they wouldn't rez you because of LD
unless they can confirm it was a network outage on their side of the
internet and only then.  It doesn't stop people from petitioning for a rez
for LD though.
