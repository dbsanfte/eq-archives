Heres a quote from my game box:
Must be 11 years or older to play.

So we must conclude that a girl who are 2 years too young to play EQ (and
probably DAoC too, dont know about that one) can from what is probably a short
look at the brother playing (lets assume that the parents follow the age
warnings) are able to judge the difference between the 2 games.

Hey, i heard a 15 year old girl once say that driving is boring (cant get a
drivers license before your 18 in denmark), so lets all stop driving, and use
bikes, or the public transportation system instead.
