I have seen this kind of thing multiple times. 1 group told my level 25
druid that casters didn't need to loot. Another informed me that we looted
FFA & if I was casting from behind & didn't get to loot - too bad too sad.
As in RL there will always be ignornant or stupid jerks that are
insensitive, arrogant & selfish

I play for fun, but you still need money for spells & equipment to play well
enuf to go to the fun places.

I respond the same way. Voice my displeasure & leave. It hasn't always made
me popular, but I almost always find a place in a group & have very few
people on my ignore lists.
