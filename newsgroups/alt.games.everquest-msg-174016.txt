In response to Khosh and sanjian;

I don't disagree that the American contribution helped to win WWII. But to
say that the US "saved Europe's ass" is false. The US joined the war and
helped to win it. The phrase "saved their ass" makes it sound like the US
came in like a gift from god and single-handedly beat back the Nazi forces.
