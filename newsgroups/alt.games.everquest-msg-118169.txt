  Because only the number of coins is split evenly, the system doesn't keep
track of denomination really.  I like that the system doesn't automatically
"make change" for you, because I'd rather have 1 platinum than 10 gold or
100 silver pieces.  I prefer it when my groups leave autosplit off because I
only want platinum and gold, I destroy silver and copper.  When autosplit is
on, usually all I get is silver and copper, and maybe some gold and the rare
platinum.

  If you want to get your fair split, assign a master looter whose job it is
to loot everything in sight without autosplit off and keep track of the
amount of platinum he's looted, then do a /split everytime someone leaves
the group, or before someone new joins, or when the group disbands, ect.
You can also take it a step further and have the MLer go and sell the vendor
loot and split that, or the MLer can just dispense with vendor loot in a
roughly even fashion.  Providing the Mler is someone you trust, it's a great
way to do things.  Corpses don't rot or clutter the landscape because they
went unlooted, and it's just about the most fair and even way to make sure
everyone gets roughly the same amount of loot (presuming your MLer is honest
and has it together.)

  I don't see how it's really an issue for or against soloing, because
presuming you loot just as much as anybody else in the group, in the end you
will probably get just as much loot as anyone else in the group.  Sure,
soloers will always have an advantage because they don't have to share when
they're soloing, but usually a group is capable of killing more things in a
quicker span of time than a soloer is, and you're much more flexible about
where you can hunt when you have a group.  If you "can't solo" I presume
you're a melee class, in which case you probably loot more often than the
casters who feel compelled to meditate whenever they're not doing something
important.
