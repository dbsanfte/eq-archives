It does have more depth, in my opinion.  There are interesting quests
and quest mechanics.  The encounters are more complex.  The gameplay
itself is much more involved (I guess that's the Playstation in
me...the naysayers call it "twitch").  Instead of EQ, where I'd set my
monk to autoattack and periodically hit the ID/Kick buttons, in WoW I'm
much busier, constantly reacting to what's happening.  (granted, I only
got up to 47 in 3 years of playing EQ, so I wasn't a hardcore raider or
anything like that, I did a lot of ID soloing....and about 4 months
hanging out in Dalnir's Crypt :P)

This has its drawbacks, of course.  For me, it leads to much less
socializing, because you're much busier pressing buttons.  Add that to
the fact that soloing is par for the course and you've got a much less
social atmosphere.  I think the lore is slightly less rich, but then
again, it's had less time to develop (well...except for the RTS games).

Now, if Blizzard would just hop on the "let's add tons of content"
bandwagon that SOE seems to be on.  I'm getting tired of the same old
zones :(
