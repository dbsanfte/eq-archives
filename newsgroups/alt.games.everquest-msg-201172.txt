That's incorrect. It consists of casting the right spells no more often 
than necessary for a given situation. Can you maximize your mana efficiency 
by rooting and DoT'ing or rooting and nuking or self-buffing, DoT'ing and 
melee'ing, etc.

There is more to it than casting and sitting. You know that.
