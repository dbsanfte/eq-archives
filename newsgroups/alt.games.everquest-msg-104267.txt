Funny seeing all the people holding up signs for Master tickets(badges) on 
Washington Rd. (main road to the front gate of the Augusta National).  I'm 
half tempted to  make a sign auctioning sow potions or something and 
sitting by the road to see if any EQ people would stop by.  :)
  
Almost makes me feel like I'm driving through East Commons in RL minus the 
mobs of course and the mountains.
