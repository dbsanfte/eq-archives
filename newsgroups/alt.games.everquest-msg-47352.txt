Hmmm...I don't recall that tunnel being long enough or twisty enough
to get lost in.  Usually the tunnel people complain about when they
are on Barbarian corpse runs is Blackburrow, because it is long,
twisty, has some rocks in it that can block you, and has some gnolls
in at that have no trouble killing you if you are below level 7 or 8
or so.

BTW, I just took an Erudite Enchanter to the Surefall tunnel and the
Blackburrow tunnel, and tried them with no infra vision and no light
source, with a candle, and with an illusion that gaves infravision.
Results:

1. With no candle and no infravision, both tunnels are navigable now,
although right near the zone into Blackburrow I ran into a wall a
couple of times and had trouble seeing which way to go.  It is a hell
of a lot better than it used to be, though.

2. With a candle, both tunnels are easily navigable.  However, you
would want to be cautious in a hostile place.  Details, like places
mobs could be lurking, do not stand out.

3. Infravision.  Darkness is not a hindrance at all, as far as I can
tell.
