We clearly differ on that point. I think its the best reason in the 
world to buy a game. I value spending my time with friends in a title 
over playing by myself in a title that I prefer for technical reasons.

When I go to a movie I'll often settle on a movie that they'd rather see 
over one that I'd rather see. When I go to a restaurant I'll often 
settle on a venue at which they'd rather eat, than my own first choice.

(And of course, they do too... its give an take.)

Indeed it would be difficult to maintain any sort of freindship at all 
if I turned left every time they turned right. Not much point spending 
an evening with friends if we eat in different restaurants, watch a 
different movie, hit different clubs for beers afterward, and then all 
get back together for a lan party where we drunkenly play different 
games...

:p
