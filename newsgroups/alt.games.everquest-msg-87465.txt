I've only done 2 MQ's in EQ so far (level 60 on my 30th or so AA level) once
as buyer and once as seller.

i was pretty weary, having once been the victim of a scam, and several times
having loot I won ninja'd

When I bought the chardok pipe for my epic MQ, we went to the spawnholder
place and I asked him if he wanted paying first, he said yes.. so I said I
would log onto my SK and wiz, get to a bank and run to him, whilst he killed
the PH (a green skele, him being a 60 chanter it shouldn't have been a
problem)

Well the first skele pop while we were discussing this got him to pretty low
HP (he was sat) and whilst I killed it, the chanter was pretty low on HP.. I
ask him if he's gonna be ok, he says "sure i have my pet"  you can guess
what happened next :/

He insta agrod the second ph pop, because of his low HP, and I couldn't get
the skele off him till he was dead.. so now I had to get on my cleric
instead of SK and rez him first, before I could do that though the epic
named mob popped, he ran over (was bound in the same zone) looted the MQ
part from his corpse and did the MQ with me, then I rezzed him, then logged
to my SK and we all ported to the bank

The second was selling a vel mq armour piece, and he paid me, without
prompting, stood infront of the quest npc before doing the MQ

For big mq's, I would suggest going with somebody in a good guild with a
good rep.. check your servers messageboard to get the lowdown on people and
decide if they are worth taking the risk
