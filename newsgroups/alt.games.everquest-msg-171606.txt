>> At what rate does mana recover/refill?  How many mana points per 6
seconds? At LV29 with +185 INT (134 base) & +68 Mana, I've got 1199 total
mana points and medding from OOM is VERY SLOW! <<

A necro should never have to sit and med for very long. We have spells
specifically designed to increase our mana pool:

Level 8: Dark Pact 3 hps to 2 mana per tick
Level 20: Allure of Death 6 hps to 4 mana per tick
Level 34: Call of Bones 12 hps to 8 mana per tick
Level 49: Lich 24 hps to 20 mana per tick
Level 56: Demi Lich 32 hps to 31 mana per tick
Level 60: Arch Lich 35 hps to 35 mana per tick
Level 60: Master of Death 43 hps to 44 mana per tick
Level 64: Seduction of Saryn 43 hps to 50 mana per tick

Since these take our health, we have spells for that as well:

Level 1: Lifetap 5 hps damage, we gain 5 hps
Level 4: Lifespike 11hps gained
Level 12: Leach 12 hps per tick for 9 ticks
Level 12: Lifedraw 45 hps
Level 20: Siphon Life 75 hps
Level 29: Spirit Tap 150 hps
Level 29: Vampiric Curse 200 hps over 9 ticks NOTE: You will still get these
hp even after the mob is dead
Level 39: Drain Spirit: 226 hps
Level 49: Bond of Death: 120 hps per tick for 9 ticks
Level 49: Drain Soul: 338 hps
Level 57: Vexing Mordania 183 hps per tick for 9 ticks
Level 59: Touch of Night 720 hps
Level 60: Lifebane 560 hps *unresistable*
Level 60: Trucidation 1100 hps

So at level 29 you should be using Allure of Death for mana, and Vampiric
Curse for health. Cast both these on the same mob will net you 146 hps and
36 mana in addition to your normal regen rate.
