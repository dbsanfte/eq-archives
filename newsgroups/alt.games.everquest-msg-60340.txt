Pretty good overview, with nice remarks to the people playing the classes. I
do wish to comment on my (main) class though:

I myself am a party-oriented player, but I want to have the option of solo
open for when I don't have much time to play left (grab a few giants for
faction and profit and such).

Mages are pretty weak. They totally depend on their pet for practically
anything. A mage has no means to stop a mob once it goes for the him; no
stun, root, snare, fear, mez, blind or even sow for himself. This makes
mages the least defensive caster class in the game. It also means they learn
to play carefully and keep a good eye on aggromanagement.

One of the aggro management parts is of course the pets. Every mage knows
the effects of a pet getting lost. The pet-train problem is mostly countered
with the mage's earthen boots (insta-invis: insta pet-kill) and the ability
to park a pet and summon it to a new location.

Pet-control is essential and as such mages are good at it, usually better
then necros (and other pet-classes). This means they won't train a group
after level 20 (usually) and can wield their pets as efficient weapons.

As for the party abilities: Mages have few utility spells, but the few they
have are good. Aside from the summoned things like bandages, coldstones, lev
rings, waterstones and arrows a mage has the best Damage Shield in the game
and one of the best resistance debuffs. The DS counts for a serious amount
of damage in a good group and the resistance debuff takes care of having
roots, end-nukes and other stuff coming through.

The last part are the nukes. Mages are the second best nukers in the game,
but all nukes are fire and magic based and half of those are bolts which are
often blocked by terrain. Probably the best nuke a mage will ever get is a 2
second cast 450 damage bolt.


As a last note I would like to say that a few days ago I actually saw a
shout for a mage to join a group. They had a pretty rounded group (war, cle,
enc, bard, rogue) and were looking for some extra damage output as well as
an end-nuker. I knew one of the groupmembers and he loved having me aboard,
telling me he came to the idea of shouting for a mage after playing with me
in several groups for a few days.
That was the biggest compliment I ever received :)
