I assume you wish to fight summoned mobs because at level 28 druids
really lack firepower. Fortunately at level 29 you get big offensive
spells immolate and combust.

Another tactic you might want to try is to cast a damage shield on
yourself and snare + creeping crude on a blue mob and then melee it to
death. You'll probably need to either heal yourself or careless
lighting the mob during the fight.

Charming or fearing animals also works very well for xp.

Ok - Summoned MOBS

Coerced Dwarfs/Erudites/Gnomes/Tier'Dals in Dalnir.
The slime elemental in old Runnyeye. (is it still there?)
