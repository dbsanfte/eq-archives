Ok.... you have me there. But in theory it should work. :D
 And even so... source code written for one compiler is fairly
portable to another... even though it might be a nightmare to actually
right truly portable code... 

But that highlites API documentation/revision issues that I hadn't
considered... it would certainly be a bigger problem than I initially
credited.

I still think its worth doing though.

If there is anything left of it after they stop renewing it.

Never underestimate the power of stupidity.

Sure ... we could even all switch to open office (not a bad idea
anyways given that its 96% of MS office for free and more compatible
with Office 95 than Office 2003 is so you aren't even losing document
exchange. )

But you think SOE is going to SELL everquest? Or Blizzard is going to
SELL Diablo? Word processors are substitutable... games aren't. That's
like saying if Steven King starts licensing his novels we can just
read Anne Rice. Its true... but that does nothing to preserve King
novels. Different software titles aren't merely different brands of
the same tools.
