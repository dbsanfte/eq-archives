It won't hurt... What I would do first, though, is to open your EQ 
directory and list all files by date. Then save the most recent 600 MB 
to a CD (if you have access to a CD burner, of course), and then restore 
them after the reinstall. That ought to save you a pretty big download.

EQ is fairly self-contained in its own directory (except for, I hear, 
the patcher depending on IE files), so it should be pretty impervious to 
system changes. If you had some way to back up the entire EQ directory, 
you'd be fine with just restoring it wholesale after the install.

One thing you can do, perhaps, is keep your old hard disk handy, and 
then reinstall it *after* the new one, and blow away all files in it 
except for the EQ directory. That saves you a reinstall, and if both 
hard disks are on different IDE controllers, it may even speed up zoning 
times. This way you can also keep a clone of your EQ directory in your 
main hard drive in case the old one dies or you accidentally blow away 
some files.
