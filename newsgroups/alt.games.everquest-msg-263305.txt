Here are my impressions, from the point of view of someone who hasn't played
a lot.  A friend and I had just started playing DAoC again, using /level and
the bonuses to leveling in underpopulated realms to make fun duos, quickly
get them to 24, and play around in the battlegrounds (which are a freaking
lot of fun, BTW), and so the unexpected arrival of an EQ2 beta key did not
excite me as much as it normally would have.  So, I've only really played
with the EQ2 beta twice.  Once to get through the tutorial and onto the
refugee island and do a little, and once more to get off that island and
into Freeport.  I'm now in Freeport, have my room, and have been told that
hunting in the sewers would be a good idea.

So, starting from the beginning.  First impression, after download and
getting into the thing...the models seem a lot uglier than the ones in that
video from E3 a year or so ago.  From what I've seen of WoW movies shot by
beta players, they've got significantly better player models.  Looks like
the next DAoC upgrade (in beta now, I believe) will also have significantly
better models.

The tutorial was nice.  It is basically on a small boat.  You've been picked
up adrift at sea, and you get some simple quests and stuff while on the
boat, to learn the interface.

The NPC speaking stuff is interesting...sometimes it is great, and sometimes
it is freaking annoying (e.g., in the mage tower on the refugee island,
whenever you walk be this guy on the bottom floor, he starts bitching about
something...it gets annoying).

A word on character creation: after you pick race and appearance (quite
a bit more customizable than EQ1 or DAoC, but way less than CoH), you are
ready.  No stats to allocate, nor class to pick.  When you arrive at the
refugee island, you are asked by an NPC whether you are a mage or a fighter
or whatever other ones they have.  That's where you pick your class (or
rather what branch of the class tree you are going to go down).

The view is letterboxed (I believe this is adjustable), with things like
health bars and spells in the black boxes.  Works nicely.  The quest journal
is quite detailed, providing good guidance.  One entry from that is also in
the black letterboxed area, so you can always see what you should be doing
next.  (Lots of settings...so if anything I say makes you go "yuck"...keep
in mind you can probably change it).

Leveling is fast at the start.  Nothing like classic EQ1, where it took a
long time to get one's first character to 5.  I was there in no time,
without really even noticing.  I'd just be doing things, and suddenly level.
After a ding, you sometimes get new skills, so sometimes you are standing
there for half a minute watching new skills show up--and there are a lot of
them.

I found lots of little bugs, mostly cosmetic, and reported them.  Things
like spelling errors or grammar errors in quest text, or where I think the
3D position of stuff is wrong (e.g., talking to NPC 1, and the name of NPC
2, who is a ways behind NPC 1, shows up in front of the dialog and
interaction buttons for NPC 1).

It doesn't *feel* like an MMORPG yet for me, but the first session (about 3
hours) was just doing the tutorial and stuff on the refugee island, and the
second (another 2 hours) was finishing up on the island, and then getting
settled in when I got to Freeport.  Still, in EQ or DAoC, the games I've
played before, pretty quickly after character creation, you are in the
world.  In CoH, you go through a short tutorial mission which takes 10
minutes or so, and then are in the world.  In EQ2, even after getting off
the tutorial boat, it feels more like I'm in a single-player game, following
a pretty tight script.  Early in EQ1, around level 2, a friend and I decided
to try to run from Qeynos to Freeport, guided only by the map from the box.
It was a tremendous adventure--made it to Highpass and died to some bad guys
there.  I'm sure EQ2 opens up, but it seems to take longer.  The feel is as
if they are catering to people who are MMORPG-shy, e.g., that not only
haven't done any other MMORPG, but have perhaps avoided them.
