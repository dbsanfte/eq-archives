Then another class to do this if it would unbalance rangers, which, you're
right...it would...or an option to go that way...but neither of these things
would happen now, the ranger is he is, Jack of All trades, Master of
none...I just think they could have been better utilized than just another
tank class.
No I don't play a ranger, maybe they are better than I think or maybe the
players of rangers are better whiners than everyone else.

The idea isn't a realistic (in game terms) one as the Ranger character has
been made with melee in mind where what I'd be thinking of is more of an
Archer character, with their magic based around self buffs for haste with
bows etc...Don't know why I'm actually bothering with this post, I wouldn't
play such a class if it existed and the only reason for it to exist is to
quieten all the LoTR, Legolas wannabes (and boy are there a lot of them)
