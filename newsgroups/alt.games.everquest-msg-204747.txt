Yep, been there done that.  I have left two guilds, one, due to mass 
migration to DAoC, the second due to politics that were causing playing 
in the guild to get to be very much a chore.  I was an officer in the 
second guild for a while, and stepped down due to the politics, and then, 
sometime after that, left the guild because things just never changed.  I 
miss a fair number of good friends still in the old guild, but, I do not 
in any way miss the crap that seemed to go down far too often.
