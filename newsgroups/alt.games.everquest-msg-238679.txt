}Sheesh, what happened to casters just picking up a good old fashioned
}gossamer robe for the white look? :)

I had one of those too, on my wizard.  After careful analysis I decided I 
liked the look of Shainai's slightly better, so I moved all 30 of my 
characters on Ayonae to that hallway and started a kitty bard to kill her 
over and over until they all had one.  Then I deleted the poor 
very-KoS-in-her-hometown kitty. :)

It actually was a bit of a challenge killing her, even with a 
heavily-buffed level 6 bard.  She has massive regen for her level, and 
keeps losing interest and walking off while you're beating on her.

Of course by the time I was done, the bard was level 8 and it was easy. :)  
Somewhere I have screenshots of all my char's with the robe, so I can 
see how it looks on all the races it shows up on, and how it worked out on 
some of the non-robe-model races (generally poorly, alas.) One of these 
days I'll get around to sending them to Alla's or wherever. :)

That was the other reason.  Gossamer robe wasn't all/all. :)
