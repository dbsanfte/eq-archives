That is not entirely true.  It is far easier to get the xp required for each
AA level when you are 60 than it is to get it when you are 51.  You will
actually spend less time getting to the same point.  I am toying with
switching over to AA once I have a good buffer into 58, just to see how that
goes.  Also, if you split it, I suspect that the overall time to get to a
particular level with a particular number of AA will be faster than doing AA
first, then level.  AA points are a fixed amount of xp regardless of your
level, so, it is easier to get them at higher levels in general.
