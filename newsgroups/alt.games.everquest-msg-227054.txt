Gear = Plat = Gear.  No difference (for no drop stuff, of course).  If
the mob dropped 10K pp cash, would you defer to the group member who
was most in need of an upgrade?  I doubt it.

The warror may "need" the 2 AC or 10hp upgrade from that piece of
armor that dropped, but the wizard might be able to buy an even better
upgrade from the 10K plat it sells for.  If the warrior had to spend
10K cash for that upgrade he might not feel the difference was worth
10k, so in this case who is in need and who is being greedy?
