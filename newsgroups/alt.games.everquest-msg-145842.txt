I don't get this to be honest, Rangers tank fine for a long long time
with the proper choice of twink gear (eg: Barbed Ringmail BP, AC 6 +65
HPs rings etc instead of whatever crap prom queens used to wear) then
it gets really tough from around 51 to your late 50s as mobs start to
hit a helluva lot harder and only Warriors/SKs/Paladins/Monks have the
mitigation/avoidance skills to stand toe-to-toe with xp mobs and not
take craploads of damage.

Verant seem to have lost touch with a lot of the basic game mechanics
possibly because the people that designed them have long since left or
moved to other projects.  Monks are MUCH better tanks than they should
be due to flaws in the way melee damage taken is calculated, Rogues
have higher defence caps than Rangers despite mostly sharing the same
gear, what's THAT all about?  "Oh you get some spells so you'd better
deal with losing 30 points in defence to your closest chain class.  Oh
and your parry, dodge etc skills are lower are well. Please drive
thru."

Adding tons and tons of visible AC really doesn't do a gear deal
beyond a certain point as the basic code is BROKEN.  They set about
'fixing' 2 handers and ended up making them godly so much so that
Paladins with easily available high end gear [raid any high level zone
and you'll soon be knee deep in fearsome Knight usable 2 handers] can
now outdamage Rangers in melee despite Rangers giving up TONS of
defensive/healing capability so that they could dual wield.  Any
decent 1 handers that drop go to Warriors to give them any chance at
all of keeping aggro.
