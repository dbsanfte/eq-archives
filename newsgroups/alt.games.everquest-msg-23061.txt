Hi Y'all

   I'm a relative newbie to EQ, so far in the almost 4 wks of playing I've
done,  I've got a high elf cleric lvl6 and a wood elf bard lvl6.

Found I prefer the bard to the cleric no manna used at all, but.. am also
not able to really stand up on my own or with one or two others very well.
I understand my primary function is to heal and such.. But I'd like an alt
that is capable of being the tank too.

I've been told,  a gnome rogue would be a good choice, that warrior's as
either ogre's or hmmm don't remember the other one.. but ..that they make
good warriors but then they are evil so will be hard to sell and such
anywhere.
So... rogue's.. what race is best and if a gnome..they are small does that
make them good tanks?  What city or place do the gnome rogues start in?

Thanks..  keayena
