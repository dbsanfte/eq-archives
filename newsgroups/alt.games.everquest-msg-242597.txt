its a self preservation instinct, when im grouped in bot or somewhere where
escape will endanger others and it goes south my first instinct is still to
run anyway, and ill even admit that sometimes I do start to run. but then I
remember how *P*I*S*S*E*D* off I get when people train me, and I also
realize that I would rather stand there and die than get a bad reputation
for training people (have alot of time to think when giants are giving chase
apparently) so I do stand there and die. tears me up inside to just die like
that without trying to survive, but I gotto look at the larger picture. im
only hated in this newsgroup, my reputation within the game is still quite
excellent.



Exceptions to the rule: if my party trains anyway, i shout that a train is
heading to the zone, and that im not infront of that train. and then I start
following them (if DEATH is going to be brought either way, I would rather
survive than die too) and, as this has happened once ill mention it too, if
they bolt for the zone but the mobs stay on me, ill try to buy them time
before I die so that the mobs dont train. although the ONE time this has
happened they agrod new mobs and trained anyway. shrug.

And, if I was playing a class that could gate or evac I would try to do so.
unfortunately I play a beastlord so im left there to die usually:(
