They are continuing to add (or fix previously broken additions) things
to Fishing in the game, so I'm feeling less and less silly for having
maxed it out. Not only is it used in the PoTC quest for one of the nine
gifts, but now there are some pretty nice throwing weapons that can be
crafted using "High Quality Fish Bones".  These require a fishing skill
of over 189 to trivial and fish only caught in certain rather dangerous
spots. (Ok, not that freaking dangerous at all if you are fighting, but
not good places to just quietly sit and fish, either.)

VI has mentioned the possibility of some other uses in upcoming quests.
I kept an extra Blessed Fishing Pole from my PoTC work in my stock just
to use when making fishing combines, since it gives a 10% bonus to
Fishing skill when equipped.

This brings up a question: I had also been putting Hintol's Fishbringer
Bait in my range slot when doing combines, because it claims to have a
plus 2% to fishing skill also, so I was thinking I was up to plus 7%. A
guildmate told me it's a waste of time, however, because range slot item
effets wont' stack. I can't think of a way to prove this. Anyone know if
it's true?

Oh, and I got my PoTC earring last night. That baby is
SUUUWEEEEEEEEEEEET!

(Our guild tailor was the slowest one to finish her gifts, but now she's
making robes. Got mine last night and now our guild is in full PoTC
earring production mode.)
