Uh huh.  Crap like this is why I dont play PvP on EQ, too many people
with zero morals and are PvPing when they have 'inside information' or
are ten against 1, stuff like that.  If a game could ever guarantee a

idiots ganking lone travellers, or like the above attacking unarmed,
sitting players, is just yawn inducing for excitement factor.
