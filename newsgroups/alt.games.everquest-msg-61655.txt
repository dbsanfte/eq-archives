    Well, it does make a massive difference when soloing. Even 20% haste is
going to knock your downtime down by one sixth, roughly (ripostes screw the
exact math up). But the issue with melee soloing is that the HP regain rate
is VERY slow compared to med rates. The usual way of regaining HPs is
bandaging, which requires a ton of pack space and, while fast, doesn't allow
for folks to get to full HPs. The one item that breaks the "melees solo
poorly" is a Fungi. With that thing, you actually regain HPs at rates
comparable to maxed med rates, and all your haste and improved ratio weapons
actually make you a BETTER soloist than a same-level caster at lower levels.
