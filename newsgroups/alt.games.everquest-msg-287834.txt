Right, the notice boards are one way to contact a guild, though not all
guilds necessarily post stuff there.  Pickup groups remain a fine way
to meet up with people from many guilds.

As JimP says, there are many other amenities in the Lobby.  Plus of
course there are the doors from the Lobby into the Guild Hall, which
are active for you only if you're in a guild, of course.  And the lobby
has NPCs who will summon your corpses, for a price, so you don't have
go find them (and bring a cleric) if that's too much of a bother.

All of that combines to make the Guild Lobby the place where most people
"hang out", the way it used to be in front of the main bank in PoK.  And
now, when folks cast mass buffs on you while you're AFK, the buff timers
don't tick down!
