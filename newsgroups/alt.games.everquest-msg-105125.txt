 From last week's "Scream of Hate" thread...

To which Dream King then replied:

Nice assumption but it's going on the premise that I haven't performed
any tests myself.
=======================================================================

This exchange is what irritated my to the point of going out and
generating some current data myself.  However, as Lance Berg pointed
out, my testing thus far is incomplete, I need to get data for naked
L1 and armored L4 to be sure I'm comparing apples to apples.

I wouldn't mind doing an ATK/STR test with a L25+ melee, but I can't
manage it very easily on my single account / single computer.  Best I
could do reasonably easily would involve Storm Strength buff (36? STR)
from Woven Frost Giant Beards (don't even talk to me about Yaulp or
the Reckless Strength line, what a bunch of useless crappy spells),
and frankly I'd be more interested in seeing the effects of a bigger
change in STR.  Still, I might do it if I get bored enough.
