I'm sorry, I forgot cultural differences. On this little planet we
call "Earth", such sarcasm implies criticism.

Wow, struck a nerve. Truth does that, doesn't it. Listen, jackass, I
played on Stromm too. OOPS! Didn't count on that, huh? Yeah, it was
"tremendous fun" wading through crowded newbie zones up the ranks,
then, by the time it finally became sane, it turned into "yet another
server".
