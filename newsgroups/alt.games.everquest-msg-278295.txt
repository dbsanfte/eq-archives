Everyone has a price cap and, like Rumbledor said, there isn't a problem
with that.  My cap, with the way the game is today, is probably the $15
they're charging.  Much more and I'll have to seriously consider staying
with the game.

Not mentioned in previous posts about ongoing costs are game
designers/programmers.  Also not mentioned is the customer service
department.  Whether or not you think the CSD is doing a good job, the costs
associated with it (and designers/programmers) keep increasing (wages,
insurance, etc.).

Apparently a lot of people jumped to EQ2, at least in part, because of the
graphics.  I'll admit that the graphics were really the only thing that had
me wanting to play it.  I tried the free trial.  I know the trial is limited
but I really wasn't impressed with much except the graphics.

I think the best thing SOE could do is continue with new content and upgrade
the graphics.  My personal requests would be to expand the character design
options (I really miss that from SWG and There - everyone *really* does look
different from everyone else) and add housing (also missed from SWG and
There) as they've done with EQ2.

Sorry Sony, but if I leave EQ, it'll be to go to WoW, not EQ2.
