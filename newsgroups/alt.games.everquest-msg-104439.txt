Excuse me, but just because *you* have a crappy guild doesn't mean that 
everyone does.  I know that my guild would NEVER exclude druids or any 
other character from any raid, ever.  (OK, one exception, when we were 
raiding PoG the druids and rangers didn't attend very often, but that was 
their choice.)  We're a guild, we raid as a guild, we die as a guild.  
The more high-end mobs I raid, the more need for light healers I see.  
Maybe you don't want a druid in the ultimate 6-man exp group, in the same 
way that you don't want 2 warriors in the ultimate 6-man exp group, that 
doesn't mean that druids are useless, or even not wanted on raids.
Wait until you get to mobs that require a CHeal chain and do AE or DS 
damage, and figure out how to keep everyone alive without druids, shaman 
(usually too busy slowing), and pallys.
