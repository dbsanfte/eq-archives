Its mostly moot until the Windows XP 64-bit edition is really ready 
imho... and even then it will stay moot until the 64-bit driver set 
catches up, and *even* then it will stay fairly moot until the 64-bit 
application set catches up...

It could take awhile... It took until Windows 98 for 16 bit apps and 
drivers to finally mostly go away... Windows 95 was literally hobbled by 
an abundance of legacy 16 bit drivers and applications. An entire 
generation of the OS (and one that lasted 3 years instead of the current 
2 year release cycle for Windows) was hobbled due to industry lag.

The 64 bit marketing war begins now... but true 64 bit systems are a 
ways off yet. 2005 or 6 I'd guess before we've left it behind... 
(hopefully by then the floppy drive will have finally died too).
