. "Group size right now EQ works, so they shouldn't mess with it."

This is one of the most annoying parts of EQ in my opinion, I have lost
count of the times when we have just filled a group and 1 - 2 more want to
join.

Sure, could make it a raid...but the exp bonus goes out the window, the
little exp that is left is split over more people and the extra kill rate
cant make up for this.

Being able to have more than 6 in a group without HEAVY penalties would be
great, save a lot of bad feeling when you have to tell a guildly, 'sorry, we
are full'. I hate doing that but it happens so often its annoying.
