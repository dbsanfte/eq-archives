  Not to mention that, as a previous poster mentioned, Harmony wouldn't
really be necessary with these mobs.  They won't help each other when
pulled, though they may attack if you get close enough to them.

  This isn't really a camp you can "break"... you kind of just get there and
keep killing crocs until the big boy shows up.  When the ancient croc
doesn't show up, then a random number of the smaller crocs will all spawn
simultaneously... so if you get there, and kill two crocs, when the spawn
timer goes off, three might pop in all at the same time.

  It's not as painful a camp as some I've endured, but annoying when the
ancient croc spawns and you don't get the item you were camping for.  I
wanted the leggings, being a druid, but got the sleeves instead.  I
fortunately was eventually able to trade for them with a necromancer in my
guild who for some reason had the leggings.  I think the sleeves are a
slightly more common drop than the leggings, and I've heard that rarely, the
ancient croc won't drop anything at all. :\
