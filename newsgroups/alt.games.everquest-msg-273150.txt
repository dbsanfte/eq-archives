I'm cool as a cucumber, my friend. Any insults I may have tossed in (of 
which there were only two that I can even think of, one of which was 
obviously deserved) were retaliatory on Bob's behalf with the possible 
exception of the Hooked on Phonics reference I made in response to your 
claim that you couldn't get through the post. That was based merely on the 
fact that I didn't see what was so complicated about it and therefore 
considered it likely that you were being overly critical and beligerent. My 
apologies if I was mistaken.

Perhaps, as I mentioned elsewhere, it was merely a culture clash between 
the two groups. A.g.e. regulars are not only used to these posts, but also 
have a good frame of reference for them as well.

Still, in a group as diverse as c.s.i.p.g.r., one should be able to 
appreciate a post such as this for what it is rather than pointing out the 
irrelevant fact that they were confused by it's terminological bias toward 
the game upon which it is based.

Someone compared it to making as much sense as bridge or cricket game 
recaps, but a more apt comparison to the situation would be that person 
popping into the bridge or cricket forums and complaining that they didn't 
understand what the hell people were talking about.

I'm certain it wasn't meant to be an EQ2 primer.
