This is very poor form on the Guide's part. They are *never* supposed
to use canned responses. Your petition was clear. I mean, wtf do you
think she can help you with? A trade dispute? Your petition says
you're stuck under the world.

I have never managed to keep my temper when a guide responds to a
petition as if they haven't even read it. It's simply incompetant.

It sounds like the first person you got was an appy, which explains
the incompetance. A regular guide would have gotten you out themself.

Ain't that the truth.

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
