1.  Most mobs (maybe all) can summon, so i never tried.

2.  I bought it for 9 aa's and to be honest its one of the more useless AA's 
we have, for the cost, the fact it only works on animals (that must be a 
considerable level lower than you), i would consider it a waste.  Theres 
definetely more important ones you can use, also although im not sure i dont 
think you can use it at all in omens zones.  I think i used it once or twice 
:(

3.  Yes only on animals, and animals of a lower level, for instance in PoN 
you cannot charm bloodravens with it, and they were blue to me at 51/52/53?

4.  Aye we do, just most druids dont bother with it

5.  Correct it works the same, you just cant zone with the pet.

6.  Totally depends on how you play solo/group/raid, for raiding SOTW3 (or 
whatever the omens upgrade) RC, MGB are all nice to have, for solo or 
grouping i would go with exodus (instant evac) and SCM (if thats the one 
that lowers your mana per cast)
