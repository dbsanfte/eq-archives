Has anyone used the free PC zone eddition of EQ and reached the end of the
15 day trial period? If so, do you get the option to pay subscription and
continue or is this version just a 'trial'. It doesnt work the same as the
free 30 period you get when you install the retail version. If i remember
rightly, when i installed the retail version I had to give my credit card
details immediately and wasnt charged for the first month. The PC zone
version tells me every time I log on that I have x days of my trial left.
I'm reluctant to play this account If I will be unable to continue after the
15 days!  Thanks in advance.
