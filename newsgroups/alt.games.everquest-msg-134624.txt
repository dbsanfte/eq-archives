It's not two people.

Goondi (AKA Ghandi, Michael Dych-whatever, AKA a wealth of other sock
puppets)  forges my 15 yr old daughter's name and posts some REALLY
disgusting crap.

I change my posting info and it allows me to cancel all his posts..

Twice now, I have forgotten to change it back.

Never claimed to be the sharpest tool in the shed..  :^)


Look back on the post by Tanya Worley and look at the headers from about 0630
Am this morning. The post attacks his daughter but it is coming from the
"eqstuff.org" server. There is no way anyone but EQ can change that, therefore
it's proof that it's him doing the posting as Tanya Worley and attacking his
own child. What a lowlife scumbag could do that to his own child?
