	You get HQ ore by recycling FS weapons.  The amount seems to be related to
the weight.  A FS Rapier got me a Small Brick of HQ Ore; a FS 2Hand Sword got
a Small Brick and a Small Piece.

	Since you can't normally buy HQ ore in the first place, this is a great
deal.  You could go to SolA, kill Goblins for ore, turn all the FS you get
into more ore, and even collect unrefined ore for the vendor restock quest.
