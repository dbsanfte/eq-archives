Ok guys need some help here my mage has just reached 34 and I am looking
into Pet Focus Items. Does anyone have a list or website link to explain the
pet Focus Items. Are there just the Stien, Torch, Shovel, and Broom or are
there higher level items? If there are some higher level focus stuff what
are they?

Thanks for any help you can give.
