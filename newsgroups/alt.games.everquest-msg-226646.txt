Since dinging 60, this effect has been very apparent for me because I now
get invited into groups that include 65s as well as groups that go as low as
54. At 58 and 59 the range of groups I got invited into was much tighter.
(At 60 a BST gets a 50% slow and a 40% haste, giving our desireability for
LDoN groups a distinct boost).

The difference in my own exp earned from group to group is now quite
drastic. In groups where I am the lowest level the bar just flies, I've
gotten almost a full AA or better than two yellows of regular exp in a
single adventure. Whereas the very next adventure may only get me two blues
because I'm grouped with folks 54-59.

I don't sweat it, I join whatever group is available that doesn't include
anybody on my personal s**tlist. The best thing about LDoN is that it makes
it easier to just play the game and enjoy it and let the various rewards
roll in as they come (exp, LDoN points, loot).
