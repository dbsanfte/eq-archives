I may be missing something, but Mages run low on mana like anyone else, and I don't see where (until high levels) they
get anything that will regen their mana any faster than anyone else.

Summoned items sure won't do it for them, because at the lower levels at least its quite cheap to purchase items that
permanently have those same effects.

Mod Rods don't do it, not anymore, heck, without a healer partner, not really ever.

The summon mob and then reclaim energy off it trick does function, but if I understand it right, only at the higher
levels and with some effort.

Necros, on the other hand, well you'd have to be lazy or cowardly to want KEI instead of relying on your own formidible
resources as a necro!
