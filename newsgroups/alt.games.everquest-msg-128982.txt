*chuckle*  I started up a baby druid in GFay the other day and someone 
shouted out they were giving out clarity.  I went up and hailed her and 
pointed out I wasn't sure clarity would do any good for me yet, but if 
so, I'd be very grateful to have it.  In return she gave me clarity 
*and* insight.

I was GOD. :)

Ryou
(and then there was the level 60 druid who gave me skin like nature and 
sow - TWICE)
