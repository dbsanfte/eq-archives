Not sure whether you mean just in Qeynos (per the quest number you
posted later), or the Exterminator quests in ALL the starting cities.
If you're already non-KOS to the honest guards and merchants in Qeynos,
then yeah, doing turn-ins in Qeynos won't help with the other factions
in that city.

I've done a lot of faction work with my Iksar, and am non-KOS in most
of the so-called Good cities, though there are still factions here and
there that hate me (esp cleric guilds).  I used the Exterminator quests
a little, but I suspect they give only a minimal faction boost, so I'd
expect it to require several hundred turn-ins to go from KOS to maxed.

Usually there are other quests or mobs that give faster boosts to the
same factions.  E.g., for Qeynos I just waded through Blackburrow a
while, either when it was empty or helping lower level PCs to mooch
the faction hits.  For the Corrupt Qeynos Guards you can use the orc
and gnoll scalp quests in Highpass, or get a chanter to make you non-KOS
to the corrupt guard in North Karana near the bridge to EK, who sells
Blackburrow Stout (but then you'll have to repair your faction with the
honest guards).

I recently inherited a cleric (a friend was retiring his second account),
and was mildly annoyed to find I'm KOS to the corrupt Qeynos guards, as
it causes problems if I try to mem a spell in my home city.  (The guards
are green, but will attack when I sit to mem.  Not sure if the honest
guards will then join in; there didn't happen to be any around at the
time.)
