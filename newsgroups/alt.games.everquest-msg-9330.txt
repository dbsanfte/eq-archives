Not worth the risk?
Hmmm i think its one of the best rings in game... just think of wearing 10th
and 9th ring...its 19ac , 19mr , 19 str plus the nice right click effect ,
wich is instant cast.
Also , the quest is the most fun and intresting I have ever done. I am
currently stuck with 9th ring.... but its worth every minute I put into this
quest , try it out !!!
