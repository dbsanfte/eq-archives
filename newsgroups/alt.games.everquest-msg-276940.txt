Projecting what I would do? Certainly not. Projecting what a company would
do given a lack of morals and a lust for livre? Absolutely.

And yet is remains isolated. The number of games where money doesn't buy you
an advantage in one corner, and "Magic: The Gambling" in the other. I expect
chess and go will outlast the pyramids. I don't see Magic in the kiddies
hands much now, do you?

In much the same way as horse races are rigged, because people are prepared
to pay money to corrupt the rules of the game...

I have no problems with a game where up front is made clear that money will
buy you victory. What I see instead is the gradual introduction by stealth
of this, with official denials and the promises that a poor person can still
compete despite the odds.

It stinks, most people don't want it, and it is not inevitable.
