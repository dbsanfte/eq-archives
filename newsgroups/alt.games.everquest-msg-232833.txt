I personally love EQOA.  I've been playing it since it was in beta.

Just have to navigate away from the children alot.  There are many more 
kids playing EQOA than EQ. It seems like parents get it for thier 
pre-teens with no concept that it's an online game and that they are 
going to be playing with strangers.  Unsupervised teens and EQOA is not 
a good combo.


I recommend going to eqoa.allakhazam.com for alot of info that will help 
you.  eqoa.crgaming.com is an ok site but not as good as allakhazam.

If you get EQOA, make sure you do all your quests, don't just go out and 
bash critters.  You'll miss out on ALOT of xp and  you can't get certain 
abilities unless you do the quests.  For example: level 5 warriors get 
taunt.  Taunt is very much needed in EQOA because of the 4 person per 
group limit and the crazy heal agro.  BUT you can't buy a taunt scroll 
for another class and use it on your warrior.  You must do the level 5 
quest in order to get it.  BUT in order to get the level 5 quest you 
have to do the first quests.  The first few quests are fairly easy. 
First one is get an item off a merchant nearby and come back to trainer. 
  Second is to visit spiritmaster and coachman.  Just on those 2 things 
you'll get to level 3.  Don't bother killing anything until you get 
those 2 quests done.  Also, never sell your stuff untill you do quest 
turnins.  BTW, you don't give items to NPCs like in EQ, you just need to 
have the item in inventory and then talk to the NPC -- that one threw me 
off at first.

If you need help and you start a character on Hodstock, you can send in 
game mail to Bebinn any time.
