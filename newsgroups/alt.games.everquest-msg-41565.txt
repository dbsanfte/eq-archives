You don't seem to be very well-informed about Bin Laden's motives.  He
issued a "fatwa" in 1998 declaring it the duty of pious Muslims everywhere
to kill Americans wherever they might be found.  This was before the
embasssy bombings.  The turning point for him was the U.S. presence in Saudi
Arabia, and U.S. actions against Iraq.  This is a man who seems quite
literally to want all Americans dead, for reasons only peripherally related
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
