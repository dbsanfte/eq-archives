It happened again.  I'm trying to help someone and cast an AOE stun, and 
everything goes to hell.  The last time I did this, I was fletching in EC 
and a guy I was going to clarity brings a Bear with him and does a /y.  I 
didn't have my Nuke memmed, so I decide to stun it while I mem it.  
Merchant takes affront to it and if I had run west instead of east, I would 
have made the zone.

Last night, a different story, much more interesting....

I'm at the Gypsy camp in NK and a nice druid is there and we are going to 
trade SoW for Clarity.  She's fighting a yellow ( to her ) beetle of some 
sort, and I decide to "help" by AOE stunning it.  *duh*

The chanter lady there wasn't happy with that bonehead move and she and her 
pet go off on me.  I take off, as I still have my old SoW that I was going 
to replenish, and get far enough away to gate.  I cast gate, and it was 
interrupted.  The pet whales on me, so I 6-second stun it and try to gate 
again.  She immediately nukes me and I go enconscious.  While I'm 
unconscious, she charms me and right after that, I get slain by the ever-
present "pain and suffering"

As SOON as I die, I get a Disconnect.  I log back in and find:

1) I'm at the spot where I got charmed
2) I have about half a bubble of life
3) I didn't die
4) My pet was sitting there inert.
5) The poor druid that I was trading with -did- die from the Enchanter 
lady, even through she never tried to buff me at all nor did she join the 
battle.

It was quite an interesting chain of events.  The chances of her nuke 
putting me unconscious, but not dead, her pet still being stunned ( so it 
doesn't kill me ), her charming me, then the "pain and suffering" "mob" 
killing me were pretty slim, I would say.

I imagine there was a disconnect because the game was going to respawn me 
at my bind point ( as it thought I was "Dead"), but I was logged on, yet, 
an NPC, so it knew there was a problem and the game is coded to issue a 
disconnect.

I must have healed up at the NPC rate while I was a charmed NPC and not in 
battle mode, which gave me that half bub of HPs.

I do understand about my pet still being there.  It's a bug that I have 
encountered while soloing the Evil Eyes in the Gorge.  I had several inert 
pets in there at one time before, and had to call a GM to come kill them.

What I don't understand why the Druid got attacked by the Chanter gypsy.  
She was buys fighting the bug and never did a thing.  Can anyone explain 
this?
