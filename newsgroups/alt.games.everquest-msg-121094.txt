In Seb last night and a Froggy wizard nuked me for 1150 - yeh, Ice Comet!!
All I can say is fair enough, this does make them more interesting but one would hope
that they have a corresponding amount of HPs that a wiz would, and would go OOM after
chain casting as they do. Not yet though, a friendly Frog shaman had sped and buffed
him and he could tank like a high end warrior PC. If they are going to stay with this
formula, I sure hope they are gonna up the XP in these zones cos fighting there now
has just become seriously harder.
