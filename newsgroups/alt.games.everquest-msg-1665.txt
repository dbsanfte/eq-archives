If you code your hotkeys with "/say", it'll do a "say" no matter
WHAT your chat mode is set to.

Instead, just leave off the "/say" and have your sentence text
programmed into the hotkeys.  Or prefix them with "/gsay" or
simply "/g", which will do group chat no matter what your
default "speaking mode" happens to be.

Furthermore, I did some experiments, and found that the length
of the sentences has no effect on how fast you learn the language --
all that matters is how many sentences have been exchanged.  So
I just go with:

   /gsay Hi
   /gsay Ho
   /gsay Ha

Etc.  This cuts down on the transmission overhead, and lowers
the chances of someone being spammed into Linkdeath by accident.
