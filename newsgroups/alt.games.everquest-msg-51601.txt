I did it many times as a 52 ranger solo trying to get the fangs for a friend
of mine who still needed her call of flames; resists are important. Real
trick is the following:

1) Use invis.
2) This is an outdoor zone. Use harmony.
3) Use root and snare to seperate the contents of the rooms
if you cant harmony - theres no need to fight everything at once.
4) Remember casters can still nuke if they're rooted ;)

I've no idea how well a druid can do it with the HP differential, but
really, it wasnt a problem for me at all. I got bored and started
exploring and did the Advisor and Lasna Cheroon for fun too.

Also, you'll have gate, but nothings quite as much fun when invis drops early
as the puppyform + lev charge out over ancille valley being followed by half
the world.

Oh, and the cooks harm touch if you get too close; don't ;)

Finally, if you're in the castle near the tower remember you avoid training
folk by leaping off the balcony and straight through the zoneline - the mobs
will path the long way and wont get anywhere in the short time it takes you
to reach the zone.

Its a lot of fun, Mistmoore, and very very pretty. It needs reitemising in
light of Velious and Kunark, but if you remember the "old" days when a
diamondine was the most uber of ubers and multi group level 50 raids
got chased out of the ballroom screaming it can still be a real thrill ;)
