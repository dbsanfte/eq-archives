I'm toying with the idea of playing EQ sort-of-regularly again, but 
since I actually like to see the yellow bar move, and apparently the 
levels 66-70 resemble a pregnant slug crossing the Salt Lake in this 
respect, I'll probably get my baby (lvl 17) necro out of the freezer, 
rather than struggle to take Hanrahan and his full suit of Elysian armor 
anywhere.

My twinking budget is around 10k (if I can get it back from the people I 
lent it to when I "quit" :), and, apart from the typical "maximize HP" 
strategy, I was wondering if there was one single item, at around that 
price or below, that would really make a difference to a necro at low 
levels. It doesn't have to last forever... if it makes 17 to 45 
noticeably easier, that's what I'd go for.

Any suggestions?
