Although its somewhat late to jump on this bandwagon, the Combine and 
Sleeper servers were started just this summer, and limited which 
expansions were available; originally just the "classic" three 
continents, then adding more expansions at intervals; Kunark, Velious, 
Luclin, POP, LDoN, and LOY are currently open.  This means there are 
still a lot of people playing in the old zones, and that the game is a 
lot less topheavy with level 65's and dozens of AA (current level limit 
is 65) than "normal" servers with 75's with hundreds of AA.  Also, it 
has a lot more people who are interested in those older zones; if you 
weren't interested, then you tended to stay on existing servers.

The guild I'm in takes this a step further, having vowed, in raid terms, 
to try to stick to experiencing the content in order, and to do 
everything; we did VP, which I know 99% of EQ players never have, and we 
did it after Velious was already open, while most people were skipping 
VP in order to do Velious progression.  Similarly, we're still working 
on ST access, just finishing up our runs on TOV... despite the fact that 
Luclin and even POP are out there.  Individual members are doing BOT and 
so on, but the guild as a whole is staying with our own progression timing.

There are other guilds out there which are moving even slower than we 
are, too.

This means you could concievably "catch up" enough to find guilds doing 
content you liked, instead of playing on "normal" servers where everyone 
is in TSS zones, or running MM's for their lightning fast exp advancement.

It also meant the people who wanted to start over, or who were just 
starting up for the first time, tended to concentrate onto those two 
servers; this is less true now, when a lot of people are starting over 
with Dragon-kin, which are only available on the original servers; but 
for a while, almost all new character starts were happening on just two 
servers, which meant it was very easy to find people to group with in 
the lower levels.

If to you, 60+ mobs are still the low end game, then Combine/Sleeper 
play might solve your woes; while you may find the pickings leaner than 
you like in the 20-50 game, solo or small group play are still very 
viable ways to get up to where there are currently tons of people doing 
the content you're interested in.
