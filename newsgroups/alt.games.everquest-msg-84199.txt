True, but it's the paying money part that spites most people. If you buy
petrol for you car, you can expect it to burn, if your friendly
neighbourhood petrol station starts pumping a hit and miss mix of water,
sugar and petrol in your car, you wouldn't like it one single bit.

Alright, enough time spent here, gotta get back online, mobs to kill, stuff
to sell, wonders to see, fun to be had.
