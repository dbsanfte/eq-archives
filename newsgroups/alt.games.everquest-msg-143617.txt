Sure, it works, but it's also extremely irritating.  I'm sitting on my 
butt not looting for a reason, you know, and making us get up and loot 
lowers the whole exp per unit time thingy.  How convenient it would be if 
autosplit actually worked.

Yeh, that would be ideal.  Provided the group also all agrees on what is 
'vendor crap' and what is 'valuable tradeskill and spell research 
components and quest items'...  I find what actually works -best- for me 
is sitting on my duff collecting the occasional 3cp from autosplit, and 
watching the junk loot messages scroll by, and occasionally piping up with 
'err... if nobody else wants it terribly, could I have that page 
eleventyseven you just looted?  Ooh, and the froglok testicle!'

Of course, if I'm after something no drop, I make sure to threaten 
everyone with a performance of the Ancient Gnomish Dance of Joy in the 
event I am allowed to loot it. :)
