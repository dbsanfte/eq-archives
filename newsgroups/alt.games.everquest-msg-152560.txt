Not really. But it's a condition of keeping your membership in The Guy
Club (tm) that you have to endorse opportunities for other guys getting
blowjobs whenever possible. The reality is that it would just wind up
keeping him passed out on the couch for a longer period of time
afterwards.

If you're seriously trying to get him off the couch, the cat on the head
thing is probably your play. Either that, or I could send you some
detailed instructions on how to cheaply build a handy dandy little
device that only requires an electrical cord, a small in-line light
switch, two alligator clips and some black tape...
