>> NEW SKILLS ON TEST, OCTOBER 19, 2001

 Why people get all worked up about things on test, especially things
just added, is beyond me. Assuming they don't actually play on test.
What part of:

"We have compiled a list of the new spells. Note that this information
is purely hypothetical as to the way it will be implemented, what we
have listed is just the basic information available on the spell/skill.

As always with test keep in mind this will probably change and may not
even go live."


 is unclear?
