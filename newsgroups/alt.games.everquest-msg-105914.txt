It would be possible to code for one type of spell, though... the
myth as I heard it was that Fear works better with lower
Cha.  Many classes have Fear type spells, so this wouldn't be
a case of coding for just *one* class... Necro, Chanter, Cleric
all have premier fear spells, and SK sort of play along while
druids and to an even lesser extent rangers have fear restricted
to animals.  Then there's the Instill Doubt skill.... heck, its hard
to find a class that -doesn't- have some minimal Fear capability.

As I heard it, Necros (and chanters...) have to chose between
plus CHA gear for charming, and neg CHA gear for fearing.

Course some experimentation with my dwarf cleric (starting
CHA 45) showed literally no difference between a zero CHA
and a 100 CHA in terms of Fear sticking and in terms of
Fear duration, similarly I noticed no difference on my little
twink necro within the same CHA range.

Too bad, I think it would be -cool- for there to be such a tradeoff,
and for neg CHA items to be actually desirable for some circumstances.
Oh well, thats Verant for you... so often we project more into the
game than they put in.
