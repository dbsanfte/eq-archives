I too am a shaman and I would recommend www.shamanscrucible.com this website
for shamans is one of the best class specific websites available. You now
also have the ability to join serverwide chat channels which can be very
helpful. The way to join the serverwide channel for shamans is /join
serverwide.crucible :crucible Type this into your chat bar.  Then when you
have a question or want to talk to other shamans type in /1 and then the
text your text.
