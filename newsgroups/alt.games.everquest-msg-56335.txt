Have they restored the boat, or do they still have the port NPCs?  If
they kept the port NPCs, then binding in EFP would be close enough to
make this not really necessary.

Hmmm...so now there are more than two levels below regular blue that
will give XP.  Wonder how that will roll off?  It used to be that the
highest greens that gave XP would give half the XP they would have if
they had been blue, and the ones one level below that gave 1/4th the
XP that they would have given had they been blue.

Yeah, big step in the right direction.  Better would be to not allow
the trade to go through without an extra confirmation if something
will have to drop.  That check could be done entirely on the client.
