}complete inability to track anything, so I gave up on them.

A bit after luclin came out, like 6 months, when the quests were finally 
figured out, I checked them out pretty carefully.  In general, I found one 
piece per set that was a moderate upgrade for whichever twink I was 
shopping for.  But the drops were waaaay too rare for such a small 
upgrade.  And these days, there's probably something you could buy in the 
bazaar for much less that would blow that armor away.  I gave the whole 
quest line a miss.  I suspect the reasons to give it a miss are even 
greater today.

However, if you have your heart set on it, a lot of people just sell these 
quest items to a vendor.  It may be worth doing a little vendor mining for 
them.  Especially the 'jewel' parts.  It may also be worth checking the 
bazaar for the rarer quest parts.
