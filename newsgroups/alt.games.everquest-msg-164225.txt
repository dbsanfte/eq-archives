Am I the only one who is sick of hearing...

"X class is nerfed now...Im leaving EQ forever"
"All this kewl stuff isnt dropping as much as it used to....Im never buying
SOE games again"
"My class is nowhere near as good as X class....Im going to throw myself off
a bridge if Sony dont fix it"

Stop whining FFS!
Play the game or dont.
You dont like whats being done? Then leave, or stop crying like a little
baby.
You think your class is "unplayable since that nerf"? Then leave, or stop
crying like a little baby.


Awaiting your flames.
