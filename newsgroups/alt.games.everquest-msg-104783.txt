Yep.. its called the safe spot, because its the succor spot.. succor spot
should generally be safe

It works in several zones.. I know somebody (not in my guild) who went LD
before the FA fight in ST (last mob, u drop down and can't get back up from
there) and he used a "self-succor" to get himself back to the zonein
