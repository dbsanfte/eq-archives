You sound like you're doing better than I did my first few weeks in EQ.

I did the Barbarian warrior thing, lost my corpse when I reached 2nd level,
and lost every thing I earned.  Learned from that to never carry large sums
of copper on my person, for fear of losing it :-)

Someone twinked me with some ringmail armor by the end of my second night in
the game.  That made things a lot better for my warrior.

Second character was a cleric in Qeynos.  I got to level 4, then spent
several days just fishing on the docks, listening to the /oocs, /shouts, and
/auctions....just listening and learning.  These were the days before I knew
how to respond to /tells.

Third and fourth characters I tried were in the GFay.  Absolutely hated the
GFay.  Didn't learn my way around the Wood Elf city until just a few months
ago (and I've been playing for a year and a half!)  I found the GFay too
easy to get lost in, die, and permanently lose my corpse.... as a newbie, I
lost my corpse permanently several times.  The GFay landmarks were much
harder to learn, and I got frustrated very easily.  Deleted my GFay
characters and returned to my Barbarian Warrior and Qeynosian Cleric.

Just recently restarted my GFay characters and learned my way around there.
I as a genuine newbie, found Antonica to be a much easier place to deal
with.  I'm sure you'll find plenty of folk who say Qeynos and Halas blow,
and that the only place in Norrath for a newbie to be is the GFay.   It
probably boils down to playing styles and personal preferences.

If you're having difficulties, it could be a different newbie zone might be
more to your liking as well as possibly a different class.
