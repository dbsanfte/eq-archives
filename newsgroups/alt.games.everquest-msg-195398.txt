KEI allows my wizard to do a lot more kiting. In a party where we are
static, KEI only helps keep my manabar maxxed. I can't cast mroe than
three nukes, if I can't root. I get too much aggro. SO KEI keeps the
mana high.

In a kite situation I am working up the aggro, keeping BoF on, and the
tanks are beating it's back. KEI keeps the downtime low.

I think people are turning their nose up at Clarity (c1) and Breeze at
low levels, and I think thats out of balance. I like getting a KEI,
what caster doesn't.

I think he funny part is people who forgot how to sit and med, and run
around looting stuff. For them losing KEI is disaster. The old
wizardly discipline on stand nuke sit is being lost IMHO.
