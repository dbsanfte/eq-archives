Hey guys. I decided to start playing Everquest again. I have two harddisks,
C: and E:. I had Everquest installed on E: and recently I formatted my C:
drive, but Everquest.exe, eqgame.exe and _verquest.exe don't work any more
now. I would reinstall but I don't know where my Cd's are anymore and I was
hoping somebody could help me with the error message. It says when I try
Everquest.exe and it starts to patch:
"Cannot find DLL-file d3d8.dll in the given path" and then a whole bunch of
paths on my C: drive. I'd very much appreciate any help. Thanks in advance,

DJ
