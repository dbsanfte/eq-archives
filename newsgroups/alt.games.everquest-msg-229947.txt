Was that done to stop people improving smithing? I notice acrylia drop rates
seem poorer too although i presume higher level mobs (perhaps in acrylia
caverns) must have a better drop rate than the pathetic rate of tribals in
DSP. I remember people used to sell the acrylia bricks for 20 pp and now
they cost up to 100, presumably to decrease the rate of skill increases?

So do people farm the shades instead? I notice a few mobs that werent nerfed
still drop like crazy eg xakra silkworms. I presume they are looking into
that however.
