It's lowering your faction with most gnome NPC's.
Not sure if it includes the Velious pirates, but the 'Most elves' faction
hit apparently does nothing to your Firiona Vie faction, so (hopefully) not.
Also doesn't include any Temple of Solusek Ro or Uberweapon quest NPCs.

And anyway, gnome faction has to be one of the least important in the game
=)
