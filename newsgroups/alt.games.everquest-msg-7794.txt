Hi,

I saw an earlier posting from someone who had "user supported"
Windows 2000 drivers for their Aureal soundcard which actually
enabled 4-speaker sound/etc. (I know about the 'beta' unsupported
drivers from Aureal but have not used them).

Since I bought my Aureal SuperQuad 2500 right before the company
was "aquired" by Creative, I've been using the built-in W2K drivers
and they don't support A3D or anything fancy.

What I need to know is "where can I get these new A3D drivers?!?!"
I was so caught by surprise that these even existed that I'm all
excited to try them out!

Thanks,
Mike
