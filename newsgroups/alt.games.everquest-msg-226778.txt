This is how normal autosplit works too.....thus if someone in a group of 6
power loots everything and there is often < 5 pp per drop then the power
looter gets all the pp and the others miss out.......I like the main looter
concept for LDoN  or polite ffa (free for all) as long as it is fair...I
find in LDoN that the puller and pacifier doesnt get to loot much so
occasionally leaving some mobs for them to loot is good form.
