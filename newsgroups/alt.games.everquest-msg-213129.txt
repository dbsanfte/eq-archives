Have worked out what the cause is :

If there are more than 500 traders, then the Bazaar window will crash 
the EQ/PC.

So as long as there are less than 500 Traders up when you open the 
window you should be o.k.

Also, If you update the Trader list when there is more than 500 Trader 
up it will crash.
