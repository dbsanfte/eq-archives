So you are saying that if VI introduces a change to the interface making
inspection no longer available or something that must be consented to
that the Guides/GMs (EQ Police) should still be able to inspect you?  I
can go along with that makes good sense.  If some other player wanted to
inspect me all he would have to do is become a Guide/GM.  Just like in
real life where if you want to be able to do what the police can do you
become a policeman.  Now on the other hand if you try pulling me over
and rummaging through my belongings you might find that I am not nearly
as compliant as I am with a police officer.
