And I point out again that there isn't a single shred of evidence
presented in the thread in question to back up the OP's claim. No
quotes, no logs, nothing. For all we know, it could be an outright lie
- though that's a stretch. The name could have been axed for other
reasons. There could be a LOT of circumstances that just have not been
presented. Simply posting "The GM took my name so he could take it for
himself!" isn't enough to make me curse VI. I need SOMETHING to back
it up, even if it is flimsy.
