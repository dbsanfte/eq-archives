If he's pulling in Seb, and getting 7, he's too low of a level to have /disc
defensive.

Hell, where do you even find 7 frogs alive at the same time in Seb? ; )

And often, it's better that you die than the only healer.

Not too necessary, as there are undead all over the place, and I would be
very suprised if PoP didn't have even more.

If you want examples of high level undead hunting...  Acryllia Caverns
skeletons, Karnor's Castle basement, Charsis (Howling Stones)  The Gray -
skeletons, some very high level (sun revenants?) Chardok, the bone pit
before the Royals area. (such a nice exp area, we kill there sometimes even
when the paladin doesn't come along ; ) )  All of the robes in Maidens Eye
and Akeva.  Umbral plains, the disturbed Elysian remains are level 55+, and
very very undead, as are the Dark Assassins / Masters.

Are the level 58 - 60 undead "Arisen Cultists" still in Trak's Teeth?  ( I
know they no longer drop those nice rings.)

Cite please.   Which ones?

I know verant has made a few mistakes recently about which mobs can see
through which type of invisibility (most of the luclin undead do not see
regular invis) but undead spells and Slay Undead do work on them.

Ok.  Come back later then, if you don't want me to fill you in on the things
you don't know yet.  *shrug*

Then pull.  Nowhere outside of a raid is Feign Death and Invis a requirement
for doing so.  (save possilbly Temple of Cazic Thule.)  In normal experience
groups, I tend to pull a lot, as does a rogue that I group with.   Whoever
enjoys doing it, as long as they're not a certain monk that our guild jokes
should have been given the title "the Trainbringer"

The "perfect group" isn't usually an option.  And once you have six people,
you're done.

The only time I really dislike grouping with a paladin is when there is no
haste present.  Between the better haste item, self haste, procing weapon,
and spells to add extra procs to thier weapons, the paladins usually make me
end up having to work hard all night to maintain aggro, rather than a nice
easy relaxing time.
