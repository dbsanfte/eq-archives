If you can get your hands on any sort of magical weapons, you are the
perfect level for wisp isle in Erud's Crossing. Get bound on the docks
in Qeynos, hop the boat and get off at the first stop. It's a great
place for solo and duos, you can hunt there until level 16. Don't
attack beetles, the island residents will assist them, and stay away
from the spiders, they have a potent poison for their level and they
swarm to assist. The wisps are magical, you need magic weapons or
spells to hurt them. They drop Greater Lightstones and Lightstones,
the Lightstones sell for around 8 gold, the Greater are used in a
quest who's reward is a book worth 8 pp. Hunt for a few levels, sell
the lightstones as you get them and save up a few backpacks full of
greater lightstones.

The Vampires drop good loot as well, several large wings and fur
sellable for a few gold. There are very few dangers, only the
occasional madman or fire elemental will ever aggro you, and a duo
should be able to handle them. Around level 13, you can take on a trio
of quick spawning zombies in the water near the sunken ship.
