Everyone who read your post new what the problem was. We also knew you
were a simpleminded moron and there was  small chance you might join
our server and thus someday cause us aggravation as you A) Go afk
without telling your group... B) Hear "OOM" from the casters/healers
and decide fuck it casters should toughen up by meleeing at level
25...C) Run around a newbie zone yelling for someone to give you 50
plat (happened to me last night, you must have gotten in game after
all).  Yeah your post has "web board loser" written all over it
anyway.
