Hi all...yet another question as I have dusted off the old pally.  Seems I
miss an awful lot!  I know my role as taking primarily damage, esp in
absence of a real warrior, however it seems to me I miss WAY to often.  Now
I know I could turn off my misses and probably not worry about it, but it
seems I never missed as much with a previous pally.  Do any of the stats
affect whether I hit or miss (not proc, but actually just hit for any amount
of damage)?  Or will it always just be the level and type of equipment my
opponent wears that affects this?  Any advice appreciated (minus the "only
worry about AC"
advice..hehe)...thanks, Bill  BTW, currently lvl 32 pally if that helps at
all....
