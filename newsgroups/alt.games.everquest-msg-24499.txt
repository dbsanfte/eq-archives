I have read several accounts of how to do the stein of Moggok quest and 
thought I would give it a try. I created a mule to do the fish-whacking 
for me in Qeynos, the mule died after being hit once by the fish for 
over 400 damage, and there was a message about the fish being 
invulnerable. Is this a new thing or did I pick on the wrong fish?
