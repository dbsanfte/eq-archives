    It's been a while, but if you hang a right from the Runnyeye zone and
stay right you should run into him IIRC. Hopefully they fixed the faction
bug with him that happened when new Runnyeye went live - Diggs was set by
accident to Gorge faction. Which most people are quite KOS to. And Diggs is
what, level 50?
