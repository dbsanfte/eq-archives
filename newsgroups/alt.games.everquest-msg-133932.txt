Well, I did try it a few months ago, when I was still quite low level, and
eventually, after about ten minutes, I got attacked so abandoned it.
However, he kept moving throughout that time.  This time, as I am
approaching 50, I thought I should get this part of the epic done but it was
basically the same thing, he just keeps moving. However, I only tried for
about five minutes this time because I figured I was doing something wrong.
I will try again.
..
OK, have tried again but keep running into giants. I still couldn't get it
to stop nor was I able to hand it the painting and I was following it for
twenty minutes.
