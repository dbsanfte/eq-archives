Those target out of range messages are enough by themselves :)

1) Attacking mezzed targets inadvertantly can be bad. (e.g. a shaman who 
happens to be holding a 1hb staff who used /assist on an enchanter to 
target a mezzed mob for debuffing. Real bad...and countless other 
variants.

2) If you often play a puller or MT or soloer, you may not use /assist 
as your exclusive/primary method of turning attack on. In which case, 
when you are working with a MA, you'll find yourself pressing assist+ 
attack... which results in you turning attack off...  

3) And of course the aforementioned caster has no need to be swinging so 
why bother putting up with a bunch of out of range messages.
