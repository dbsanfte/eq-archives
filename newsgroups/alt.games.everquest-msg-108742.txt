Does any of the Geforce cards do decent at video capture as well as gaming?
I've been told the Geforce4 MX400 does this, but didn't have much luck
finding the info on their web site.  How does it do in video capture and 3D
gaming (99+% of it EQ)?

How much could I expect to pay for one?

Is it Win98SE compatible?

I'm currently on a VooDoo3 3500 AGP 16MB. (I'd also greatly appreciate any
tips on removing their drivers before installing a Geforce should I go with
one).
