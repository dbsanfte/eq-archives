It isn't ambiguous at all.  I'm not sure how what you quoted makes the
previous sentence fragment, "be sure you summarize the original at the top
of the message" ambiguous or confusing.  Whether or not you think it means a
summary or quoting doesn't matter...either way it's supposed to be on top.
:)

Top posters don't bother me unless they're replying to a post with lots of
previous quoting where most of the people (which will always be the case in
this newsgroup for the foreseeable future) are following the RFC.  They're
making it hard to read.  It's their fault, not mine, that it's hard to read.
