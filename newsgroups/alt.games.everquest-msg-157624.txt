Those are player made items that usually sell quite cheaply and certainly do
the job for most purposes.  As you can guess from Eq's post, they aren't lore,
so you put one in primary and one in secondary and there you go.  Unless you
have poor faction, taking your Cha up to 106 is as far as you need go, prices
won't get any better.

Just remember to put them back in the backpack before you start a fight, no
useful stats and not weapons or AC giving items at all.
