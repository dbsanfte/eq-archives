This may be what the socialists were trying to promote and maybe still are
in my good ole NDP time warped province.

However, reality and theory rarely meet.
And in this case of economics Supply and Demand is the greater theory on
price control.
If a tradeskiller wants 5000 silk swatches for skill ups and there are only
3000 in the bazaar the tradeskiller buys them all. What is market price. The
price the tradeskiller bought them at. Market value is not some eternal
lasting value.

Check the "Market Value" of stocks on the exchange and see how fast they
move. Some hardly at all like fungi tunics.
Some by 200 percent or more like spider silks and pelts. There is no such
thing as price gouging unless the character may die by not having a spider
silk and all the vendors suddenly jumped to 10K per spider silk...

sheesh if you want it buy it. If you don't want to pay that much go loot it
yourself.
