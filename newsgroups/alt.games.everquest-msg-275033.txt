You don't need everything pristine, only the primary component, presumably
planed elm lumber. Artisans have trouble creating pristine anything, but the
thing is, you don't need to. You are on the path to becoming a specialist
who will have powers to increase durability. Shaped or plain elm boxes will
help you and there are many quests for bags that will do the job until you
can make maple boxes or buy other types.

I have played 4 characters up in the tradeskills past artisan. The secret is
to use everything you find, especially food items. Food items are
everywhere; if you are willing you can grind to the top on fish and spices!
It's easier to try to find a t1 zone with easy mobs and just grab food
items. A lot of solvents and washes can be sold as junk for a tiny profit. I
find the t1 food and drink incredibly useful compared to everything else i
could make until i specialised.
