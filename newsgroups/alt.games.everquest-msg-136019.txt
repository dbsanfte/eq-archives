Fortunately, I did, but still.  See if you notice the problem with this 
log.  (Well, besides the horrendous use of English by a certain 
Kinudor..)

[Sat Jul 27 00:03:17 2002] There is 1 player in North Karana.
[Sat Jul 27 00:03:31 2002] Kinudor says, 'if you dont let me journey to 
luclin, ill got o your mom and sitck my'
[Sat Jul 27 00:03:31 2002] Nexus Scion says 'Take this, Kinudor.  You 
must stay  inside the circle of the Spires, and keep this shard on your 
person.  Should you need another, simply ask me.  I do not think we will 
run out of shards any time soon!  If you do NOT wish to travel to 
Luclin, destroy that which I gave you, or step well away from the Spires 
lest you be caught up in the portal. It will open soon.''
[Sat Jul 27 00:03:33 2002] Minevol cheers the wench.
[Sat Jul 27 00:03:33 2002] LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
[Sat Jul 27 00:03:55 2002] Skeyebaer says out of character, 'Donating 
for a Port to Surefall Glade'
[Sat Jul 27 00:03:55 2002] You have entered Nexus.
