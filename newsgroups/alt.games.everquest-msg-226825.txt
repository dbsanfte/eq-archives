This is one reason when I ML that I sell in POK, bank to convert the coins.
I would convert that extra 5pp into gold (I dont go farther than gold
usually), gets the split a lot closer and cuts down on the number of coins
if we are heading out again.
Course I have been in groups where somehow the split was 19p on a 50's
group, so I tend to like to be ML so that does not happen. :)
