Rumor of a major slash of the exp giving mob  base for 61+
players:

------------------------------------------------------------
Soloers: The first thing most people will do when they first
enter the Planes of Power is to go kill a mob and ding. I want to
warn those who enjoy the solo life, that they may not  want to
become level 61. Once you gain that first level, the entire top
floor of Sebilis turns all green! The fifteen levels of blue mobs
has been greatly reduced to approximately seven or eight. So a
lot of your favorite spots to solo blue mobs will now be gone.
This will  greatly reduce the number of zones that you can choose
to gain experience from.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Thats a very serious change to the game, people will be forced to
drastically alter their hunting habits if they want to include
any 61+ characters in their groups.  Verant is really pushing the
"work harder, not smarter" plan here.

For clerics, this is good news, since one central complaint of
the class recently has been that we are only needed in the
hardest encounters... if people are forced to move to harder
stuff in order to get any exp at all, then there's more call for
serious serious healing, hopefully.

As the OP noted, though, its bad news indeed for soloers, who
will have to let go of the sub 50 mob set entirely.  And since
most 50+ mobs summon, the kiting classes in particular are going
to be shut down almost entirely... unless Verant releases a
metric tonne of Ice Burrower type mobs in the planes.
