** Spells **

- Affliction Efficiency should now work on Damage over Time spells of 
level 61 and greater.

- Corrected the range on some Planes of Power group spells so they will 
affect the group, not just the caster.
- Corrected the animation for Katta's Song of Sword Dancing.
- Corrected the animation for Spirit of Eagle.
- Increased the affect radius of Radiant Cure so that it will affect 
group members.
- Changed the method of obtaining the Planes of Power 'imbue' spells.

- Fixed a problem that was preventing pet owners from controlling their 
regular pets if they had a Wake the Dead pet in use.

Dark Terror to correct a faction issue. The Scarecrow form change will 
be reinstated in the near future.

- Corrected more issues with spell turn-ins. You should no longer get 
vendor sold spells, and all the spells you get should be at the 
appropriate level.


** Items **

- Removed the level casting restriction from Necrotic Divining Device.
- Fungus Covered Scale Tunic is now Magic.
- Removed the "Pending Lore" tag from the Shralok Pack. There is no 
current plan to make this into a lore item.

- Small races should now be able to get out of the pool in Shadowhaven.
- Your box of Souls should now be returned to you when you are 
collecting souls. For those of you whose Box of Souls ended up stick in 
a Soul Orb, combining your Orb inside a Collector's Box from Curator

** By Winged Messenger **

A lone messenger streaks across the rocky roads of the mighty Wakening 
Lands, an urgent message kept safely within his talons. Dire news he 
brings to his master, the Lord Yelinak; there is much turmoil in wake of 
the prismatic's release, and he must inform the ancient dragon of the 
weary times to come. As he rushes past the lumbering trees on all sides 
of him, he harks back to a more peaceful time. Certainly the brow of his 
mighty Lord showed less strain, less agitation, though not much. He had 
always thought that the prismatic's release would surely be more 
problematic than anything else he could imagine. He now knew that there 
was much more at stake than ever before, and that the Shrine would need 
to be on its guard.

As he came to the entrance of the Shrine, he tensed for a moment, hoping 
that this dire news wouldn't end the life that he and his kin had known 
for so long. Yet he feared that nothing could stop that change, for the 
might of the Kin would be tested in the coming times, and there would 
surely be dangers he had yet to see. He made his way through the 
corridors up to his master's chambers. As he came closer, he noticed new 
members of the Kin he had never before seen. As large as his Lord, they 
spoke quietly amongst themselves and with Yelinak himself. He was 
unnerved by this startling addition to the Shrine, but felt that it was 
likely necessary. Perhaps his Lord had already heard the news and had 
already begun making plans. Either way, it was his duty to inform 
Yelinak of the recent events; the Giants would know no struggle like 
that which the Shrine would give them.

He walked towards Lord Yelinak, majestic in his appearance yet with a 
certain calming aura about him. He cleared his throat and began, "M'lord 
Yelinak, I bring news from the East..."


I think this was a fairly good patch, the mp3 player seemed good (i hope 
it just remembers where i keep my mp3s) ,also the vah shir spirit stone 
sounds VERY interesting having a val shir shaman myself. Also I can hear 
all the baker/brewer merchants that sell in the bazaar go "YAY!" over 
the change to that one. What does everyone else think?
