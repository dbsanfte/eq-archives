oh yeah, if you want a discussion ...........

warrior is the best tank

shadowknight is MUCH more fun though, sacrificing only a small amount of
"tank ness" in terms of HP and disciplines...you get cool spells, you can
fd, you can snare, you can solo

pally is cool because they get a heal at 44 that makes them look like
they're being beamed up by scotty....they heal well, get aggro easly, and
are good too

oh boy, same discussion every day ~

good game, narcisicm.....better game, spelling ~
