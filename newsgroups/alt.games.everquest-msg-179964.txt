Do you think EQ could be a place where you could change skin tone of your
toon?
If you where a black man or woman(and don't bust my chops about "African
Americans" because they think its stupid too) and wanted to be a black elf
or how about an Asian dwarf?Would it just give racist grievers just one more
topic to harass players with? Or could it be a different way to customize
your toon to more "resemble" yourself?  I think it would be great.What do
you think?
