I logged in Thursday morning hoping for a quick LDoN before bed (I
work nights). I started in PoK and got a KEI, then put up my LFG tag.
I will often organize my own groups, but I was feeling a bit lazy this
morning and was content to wait for someone to invite me into a group.

While I waited, I footed it over to the Feerott to buff a guildie who
was fighting the necromancer that pops at the entrance to Fear. We
chatted for a bit, then she had to log. I gated back to SRo, then took
the Magus to EC. My guild list showed another guildie there and I was
gonna surprise him with a Temp. I couldn't find him in the tunnel and
another check of the guild list showed that he had logged. Oh well.

About this time I received a tell. "Wanna help kill Klandicar?"

"Who's Kladicar?" I asked.

"A dragon in Western Wastes."

This sounded to me like it was going to be a raid. The last true raids
I had been in were as my Warrior against Vox and Naggy. I remembered a
lot of time standing around waiting for stuff to be organized. I
didn't have that kind of time, but I asked "How many do you have
already?"

"Eight" came the reply. "Enough to kill him."

"What the heck?" I thought. So I replied "What the heck? Sure."

I was told to head to the Nexus where I met up with a Druid who ported
us to Cobalt Scar. From there, we ran to Siren's Grotto, succored to
the other side and out to Western Wastes. We all met up near the
entrance to Dragon Necropolis (at least I think that's where we were).

All told, there were 13 of us in the raid. The MT was in my group, the
ST and the raids only other cleric were in another group. There were
two other folks in a third group ï¿½ a Druid and Magician I think.

I let the MT know to leave a buff slot open as I planned to drop a
duration heal on him just before he engaged. A few minutes later, we
were all buffed up and ready to go. The MT went running down the hill
to Klandicar. Nobody said if he was going to pull to our location or
engage him where he was. I asked in /raid, but no one answered. I
hesitantly started to follow, but at an oblique angle so as to keep my
distance. I saw a couple of others following as well, so I started to
feel a bit more comfortable. The MT ran right up to the dragon and
just stood there. I still hadn't dropped my HoT on him and was well
out of casting range, so I began to approach.

You can probably guess what happened. The MT, it turns out, was not
KOS to Klandicar, but I was. As soon as I got close enough, the dragon
turned, ran up to me, and chewed me up. I was dead in under five
seconds.

From my bind point in SRo, I could read the /raid banter and it was
clear that the fight was going well. After just a few minutes, he was
dead. I got rezzed back to WW and looted my corpse. Klandicar's loot
was randomed off (I chose not to participate the randoming) and we
split up and went our separate ways.

Anyways, I'm happy to report that Highmark has participated in his
first successful dragon raid :)
