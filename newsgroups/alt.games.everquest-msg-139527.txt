}Oh, com'on, RS....
}Are you saying you are ignorant of USENET etiquette??

now, whee did you get that idea?  I agree that it would be wrong to post 
someone else's personal information on USENET.  However, daring someone to 
would constitute permission, and given that I think The Black Sheep showed 
remarkable restraint.

Now, on the other hand, starting off-topic threads across multiple 
newsgroups...?

Top-posting and not trimming the quoted material...?

And possibly most significantly, cancelling posts you were not the 
original author of, regardless of how offensive you find the content...?

I think it's pretty clear who has problems with netiquette here.

Censorship is bad, EQ.  Very very naughty.  Unless you want to claim you 
authored those posts yourself?  In which case I can only shake my head in 
confusion.

}Oh that's right.  I forgot.. You never post anything that is accurate
}or on what you believe...

*Shrug* if you say so.  For one who is so sensitive about it, I'm amazed 
at how ready you are with the personal attacks.

}>}Can YOU think of any other reason for his disclosures, other then an

}>Well, that doesn't hold water in the least.  Why would he want you to be

}>Therefore, it must be some other reason... like, perhaps, annoying you

}>challenge, though, I'll admit.
}And you dodge the question.... 

Not at all.  I gave a reason other than the one you suggest.  As to what 
the actual reason is, only The Black Sheep could say, and I see that he 
did.  Just because it wasn't the answer you wanted does not mean the 
question was in any way dodged.

}Why the vieled threats???

What threats?  And what, pray tell, is a viel?

}On second thought, don't bother....   I want a real world answer, not
}something you learned in EverqQuest...

No bother, no bother at all.

Here's your answer.
