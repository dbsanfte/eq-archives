Let's go over the different factions and how to raise them:

DreadGuardOuter, DreadGuardInner, DarkBargainers:
Kill Halflings (not a good option for you, Druids will become KOS)

Bottle of Wine quest. Yes this will work, but you will probably already
be KOS to the NPC that gives the quest, and getting to him is more risk
than reward.

Concordance of Research (South Ro) Doubt you can do this without at
least being apprehensive. Which you are not. Turn in Lightstones and
GLS to Smith Tv'Ysa. Great xp between 8-12, and GLS will yield a book
that sells to most merchants for 9 plat.

TheDead (Necros):
Impossible for anyone who doesn't worship Innoruuk. Even then it would
take several thousand fire beetle eyes to make a dent.

PriestsofInnoruuk:
Same as TheDead

EbonMask (Rogues):
There are some NPC's in Freeport that you could kill, but will make you
KOS to the CarsonMcCabe (Rogues)

IndigoBrotherhood (Warriors):
Kill High Elf slaves in Crushbone. Again not a viable option for most
good races.
Kill High Elves in Innothule Swamp. (Same as above)
Turn in Leatherfoot Skullcaps from Halfling raiders in Nektulos.

Casters (other than Necros, can't remember their name):
No earthly idea. The only time I have ever seen it go up or down is
upon turning in Guild notes.

Basically, if you don't worship Innoruuk, or aren't a Dark Elf, it is a
tough road to take. And if you turn down that dark path, there isn't
much of a chance to turn back. As a Woody, I suggest you expend your
energies in a different way.
