I am seriously considering doing the same, and I've got my eye on a specific
machine which is extremely similar to the specs you posted. But I have a
different question that maybe can be answered here from others' experiences:
how exactly do I move EQ from the old system to the new? I have just one
account and just need the game on one computer. I have all expansions.

Can I simply move the Everquest folder to the new system and make a shortcut
to the game executable, or do I have to dig up all the various CDs and
reinstall from scratch? If the latter, what do I do about LDoN and LoY,
which I purchased via download?
