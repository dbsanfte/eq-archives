I've seen some terrible names.  Any bad ones I just usually ignore the 
person, I don't group with them and I won't port/buff them.  The one and 
only time I petitioned a name was a level 2 jerk in Sharvahl on Sept 14, 
2001, with the name Usamabinladen.  We would have ignored him if he 
hadn't been so vocal.  He didn't see anything wrong with his name and he 
was shouting to the zone about nonsense.  I couldn't handle it, my 
nerves were frayed from the recent tragedy of Sept 11, I had come into 
the game to forget the real world and this guy pissed me off.  In 
mid-sentence his name was changed to a random name.  Boy was he pissed 
when his next shout showed a different name.
