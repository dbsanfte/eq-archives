You do know how expensive it'd be to get a collection like that? Just
pop on a few pieces of hp/mana jewelry and you'd be better off,
especially since most of the tastiest wis/int pieces are no drop
and/or level restricted.

Bah, stop shooting holes in my 255-twink bashing!

Anyway, if someone wants to go to the pains of twinking like that, I
don't think they'd be all that much better off than a properly done
hp/mana twink. I'd probably just assume the twink was for
tradeskilling :)
