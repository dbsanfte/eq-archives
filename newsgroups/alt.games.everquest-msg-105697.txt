Apparently the only shamans you know suck ass. Incidently I can solo with my
chanter more than 3 times as fast as with my druid. They are both 60th . The
problem with trying to blow smoke to protect your poor cleric butt is that
some of us really do have more than one character. I hunt rockhopper hides
with my 55 monk not my 60 druid or my 60 chanter. You know why why? because
not only are they still blue/light blue and thus exp giving the kill rate is
also the same as my chanter and higher than my druid.
