You know what I think is sad...

dt made a post saying everquest shouldnt be upgraded any further, because
his sucksbox cant handle it. and nobody seems to have a problem with that,
and yet I made a reply to his post using his own words saying the people who
*can* afford nice stuff shouldnt have to suffer because of people in his
situation.. and look at all the attention I got, I tell you, I wish I was
selling tickets to this.

you guys wanna lable me a troll.. for some reason im ok with that. I usually
lurk in the shadows anyway but his post pissed me off enough to say
something.

As far as maturity.. yes im very immature. I expect many things to be done
my way, thats the mark of a leader. you are all followers. deal with it.
