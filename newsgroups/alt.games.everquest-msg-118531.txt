RoFL, it's a game people, can't you see the irony on FoH webpage? Sure 
they like to complain and make fun of everything that comes to them, but 
if you take it seriously the problem comes from you, they are far from 
being dumb or anything, ppl are just jealous maybe. Actually, most of 
the tactics used by the biggest guilds to kill the toughest mobs come 
from them, or at least it used to be that case,and that's what they get 
as a thank, insults =)
I would bet they are far more intelligent than you, because they don't 
care about what you can say, and that's what is funny, because if you 
had a better life than them and if you weren't jealous,you wouldn't 
bother to lose your time complaining about them being dumb, and no I'm 
not in FoH neither I am in an 'uber' guild, I just said what i'm 
thinking about it.
If you don't like them , let them alone, because you won't change 
anything besides loosing a few minutes of your precious time and of your 
"better-than-theirs" Real Life =)
