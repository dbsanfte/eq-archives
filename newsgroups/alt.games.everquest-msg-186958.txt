Try entering Qeynos as a troll after killing a sh*tload of Gnolls, and 
*thinking* they'll like you.

Then be able to walk through the first part of qeynos ok, until some 
corrupt guard at the clocktower starts beating the crap out of you!!

Then make a dash for the sewers, finding out the one by the bank doesn't 
zone, in near panic you'll be able to make the last few meters to the pier 
where the other sewer entrance is, after you're pulling Trumpy Irontoe, the 
fisherman, and numerous guards with you into the water. Then you click the 
grating, and think you're safe when you see the ZONING message appearing.

Loading please wait...

Took me some minutes to gather my wits and figure out what the Heck 
happened.

Ofcourse petitioned, and it got escalated a week back, but I haven't heard 
anything yet.

Corpse run was worst thing, to travel to Ak'Anon and get by the guards, 
hoping I'd find some kind soul to cast invis on me twice.

Thankfully I found that soul, and I'm still happy with Plane of Knowledge 
for travelling :-)
