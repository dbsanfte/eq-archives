I hate the conehead look. Everytime I play my erudite enchanter, I get
the strange urge to consume mass quantities.

Yes - nice chest indeed!! 8) But the aerobic spell casting animations
are silly.

I liked the plate graphics on the old models actually much better.

The even newer models are better - with the dirty looking bones and
the glowing eyes.
