LDoN is one of the best things that ever happened to EQ imo, so yes I think
you should buy it and experience what instanced dungeons are all about. It's
a very fun alternative to the traditional EQ game and has fast become a
standard part of the EQ experience for all players 15-65. My newbie toon
alts and my Time-flagged 65 with hundreds of AA's still all do LDoNs
regularly and have fun doing them. There's so much you'll miss not having
this expansion.

GoD, on the other hand, is a whole different matter. Don't even bother until
you're 65. Yeah, there are a few minor things you can do prior to that and
people will point out that there are zones you can enter and hunt, etc. But
the essence of the GoD experience is the path to Kod'Taz, the crown jewel of
the expansion and the launching point for all high-end GoD experiences. In
order to get to Kod'Taz you'll have to pass some difficult trials and I've
yet to see any significant number of below-65 players participate
successfully in any of these trials. You may be able to bypass the first
four sewer trials if you can participate in the Smith Rondo raid as an
under-65, but then you'll still be faced with the two mountain trials in
Barindu, and those are among the toughest encounters in all the game and
well-equipped 65s with hundreds of AA's will find them challenging. As
always, there are exceptions and you may be one of them, but for the most
part it remains true that unless you're 65 this expansion won't be of much
use to you.
