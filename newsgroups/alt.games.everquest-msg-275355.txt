When I logged in last night, my guy was in the bazaar, where he pretty much 
lives while I'm WoWing these days...anyway, I saw mostly grey planes instead 
of the bazaar itself. Someone told me to log out, restart EQ, and at the 
patcher screen, click on advanced, then check the boxes next to all the 
expansions you own, click on save, and then let the game redownload the 
files it needs (full file check isn't necessary). This worked for me, I was 
able to see and move once again, although I don't think I much care for the 
new bazaar myself.
