It says "We don't censor your internet access". A pretty good 
reccomendation in my opinion.

Why? What the hell do you care if they carry a group like this? Just 
because you find something "distasteful" it should be censored? 

Perhaps you should move to China- all the internet access there is heavily 
filtered, so you probably won't see anything like that group there. You 
also won't see any of those annoying posts disagreeing with government 
policy or anything like that, either.
