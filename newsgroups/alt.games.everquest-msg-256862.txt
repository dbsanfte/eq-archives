It's always been Qway-nose (Qway as in Q + "way", and "nose" with a long o,
but short s, not like the nose on your face), but I noticed in one of the
expansion trailers a couple years back that the developers pronounced it
"key-nos", so I suppose that's technically right... seeing as they created
it and all...
