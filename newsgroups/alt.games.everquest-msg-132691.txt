Why ever would you think I would want to lay blame..

My point is and always has been that it is not an appropriate subject
matter for a 2yr old.

How you leap from that to what you say above is beyond me..

A 2yr old???  Surely you jest...

As I said, my memory may be faulty.  But at 2 yrs old, I think the
latter explanation would certaintly suffice over the former..

Actually, when this discussion started, I specifically mentioned the
2-5 age group. And all my discussions since then had been regarding
the 2yr old age group.

It is extremely telling that the same argument ya'all used with the 5
yr old group, you wanted to apply to the 2 yr old group.

And that is why I say your argument is a fallacy..

However, that being said... It is true that, according to research,
Sesame Street DOES gear it's programming towards the 3-7 year old age
group.  

I still think that 3 or 4 is too young to introduce such a complex
topic as AIDs and HIV.


This comes from Sesame Street's own web site.

"Sesame Workshop and Sesame Street were created as an "experiment" in
1968, and the show debuted on November 10, 1969. The series was
designed to use the medium of television to reach and teach
preschoolers, and give them skills that would provide a successful
transition from home to school. The show gave children a head start
and provided them with enough confidence to begin learning the
alphabet, numbers, and pro-social skills. "

Now, how and when did Sesame Street become a medium to teach Political
Correctness to our young kids???  How did SS go from "learning the
alphabet and numbers" to teaching about HIV and AIDs??
