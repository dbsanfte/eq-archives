I hope someone here can help.
After installing everquest and d/l all the patches etc. I click "play
online" and all I get is a message saying "no 3d devices"
I have a very fast, all the best stuff computor. I'm running a Sniper2 32
meg 3d gamecard wich works perfectly.
Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get this game to work.
Please reply here as my mail doesn't work.
Thanks Derrick
