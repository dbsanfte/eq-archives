I'm not going to make a recommendation for a card but I finally got my
SBLive X-Gamer card working to where it was pre-Luclin.

3D sound in EQ is awesome (when it works).  If you turn up the sound effects
loud enough, you can hear that MOB approaching while you're medding and have
enough time to get up and fight or flee.  I have an Altec Lansing 4-speaker
w/sub system and I can tell what direction to turn when I hear a MOB
approaching.  You can also hear water trickling, waves crashing, birds and
crickets chirping, etc.
