Well, you can't legislate protection as a function of which species are 
most poster-friendly. I know that species go extinct all the time by 
themselves, that doesn't bother me one bit. It does bother me when it's 
our fault, and it's avoidable. And hell, whalers and poachers have 
families too...

As for logging companies planting three trees for each one they cut down... 
Are we talking about "real" trees, or eucalyptus/pine/whatever vertical 
weeds? It doesn't matter if they plant 120 trees for each one they cut 
down, if it's in the form of tree plantations that sustain less life 
than the equivalent acreage of desert.

> And nobody (at least in this thread) is arguing about discrimination.

Oh, yes, you are. If heterosexuals can marry whoever they want (with the 
usual caveats of being consenting adults) and homosexuals cannot, that's 
certainly discrimination.

Good, something we agree on.

That's the bit I don't get... there is *nothing* being imposed upon you. 
It has *nothing* to do with you. It's exclusively between the couple who 
marry and the judge/priest/civil servant who marries them, and there is 
no call for any bored busybodies to butt in. This is particularly 
irritating, considering that conservatives generally bitch and moan a 
lot when they perceive the State to be meddling in *their* affairs. It's 
not like anybody would be forcing the churches to perform gay marriages 
if they don't want to.

Not that it's any of their business, to start with...

Well, hopefully even if GWB manages to enshrine the current 
discrimination as a constitutional amendment, it will some day go the 
way of Prohibition. It's only a pity it will take a lot longer in the 
USA than in most of the Western world.
