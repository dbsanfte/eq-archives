Ouch - I feel your pain : (  Your heart skips a beat or two when he spawns
that is for sure. I spent about a hour looking for Hasten Bootstrutter until
I tabbed back to desktop and did some research and found the best loc to
grab him was -863, +477. I then got him within 10 minutes so I cannot stress
how important it is not to look for this guy blind.

On my way back past splitpaw I used them for my first AOE kite on the 5
tesch masch gnolls there and got 2 blue bubbles from the one kite: bards are
cool ; )
