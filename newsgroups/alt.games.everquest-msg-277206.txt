There is no foolproof way to tell if you have aggro.  There are some
obvious signals, for example if a monster is attacking you.  But it
isn't always easy to tell.

For example, if you're exploring a twisty dungeon, a monster might
see you from across a pit, and immediately start running down a side
hallway because that's the only way to get to you.  You have aggro,
but unless you happened to see the monster take off, you don't know
it, and you have no way of knowing until the monster arrives, probably
with five or six buddies that he picked up along the way.

Most monsters will make a certain sound or say something in chat
when they aggro.  Make a habit of watching out for these signals.
