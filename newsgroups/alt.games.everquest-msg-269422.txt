I got a crappy 4 slot bag as a quest reward and now it's seems i'll
have to destroy one of my hard earned bank packs in order to get rid
of it.

The only way I can see to get it out of overflow is to destroy a pack
in my bank to free up a slot to put it in. Took me ages to make good
packs to fill out my bank with.

Cheers,
