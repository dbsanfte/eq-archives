>> Odd equipment choices on the part of the devs on
>> some of these -

Well SOE has total access to the player/equipment database......

As bad as some of their choices appear to be, it is possible that they
reflect what a typical level 25 is wearing for a given class.

Take the PAL and SK examples from another message in this thread...

The Paladin is a very popular startup class (especially for people
just getting into EQ), but few people play them to the higher levels.
Many people quit/shelve their Paladins when they discover how
unfriendly EQ is to the class in general.  (RPing a Paladin in EQ is
frustrating to say the least, and the class really doesn't blossom
until the mid-high levels)

ShadowKnights are almost never a "starter class". In general they tend
to be played by experienced players much more familiar with game
mechanics.

I think it is safe to say that the average SK is geared up much better
at level 25 than the average Paladin.

I think most of the "weirdness" in the equipment choices can be
directly related to how popular the class is, and what they are
generally  "twinked" with.
