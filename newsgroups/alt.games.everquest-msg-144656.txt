To be really serious I would say that players age matters much more 
than nationality. I mean the gap of years between two players.
I have more difficulties to play with youngsters than with people 
of my generation.

The only trouble is the language, but English is simple enough to 
be understood even if you are not a native English/American 
speaker. If I play more with Americans, it is because there are 
more Americans players than French ones and because I do not want 
to make a difference based on language or country.

Quite an evidence...
