<big snip in here>

I am coming into this conversation late so forgive me if this has been
covered, but someone out of the blue came up to me today and after
inspecting my equipment, asked me to let him see the stats on my shackles,
and then told me that to do it  I had to drop them onto him.  I became
suspicious of this and told him the stats such as the AC benefit, and the
weight, he said that they were not what he was looking for and ran off.
Like I would have traded them anyway (it is the only armor that  I own and
they were expensive for me).  Anyway is this a normal way of doing business
or what?
thanks

Luike,
