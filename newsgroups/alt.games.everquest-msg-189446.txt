    they don't, an I couldn't believe it when I found out. The only
justification i can think of for this INSANE move is that boxes on shelves
sell the game to others.

    I never wanted the cardboard box, the CD's I didnt need (4 other friends
had everything), the posters, the mouse mat (got one thanks) and the
manuals. Not only did I pay for those, I paid for shipping from the
retailer, shipping from the wholesaler, shipping from the US to Australia,
wholesaler markup, retailer markup, packaging, import duty, Australian
GST...

    Sony could easily have sold me the keys in an email by charging an extra
amount to my CC that month, and made more money for them, and costing both
me and them a fraction of what I paid.

    What a guy had to go through to get some expansion packs was highly
ridiculous.
