I had this exact same problem when I upgraded to Athlon 2100+....Get a
bigger power supply unit.  At least 400w.  The Athlon also runs *HOT*.  I
can't get mine under 140F without taking the case off.  2 extra case fans
weren't nearly enough.  You can check your memory, but I doubt that's your
problem.  Since you are checking everything anyway, it doesn't hurt.  Just
try one at a time.  DO NOT USE THERMAL PASTE WITH THESE NEW ATHLONS!!!  It
has a small spacer on it to dissipate heat to the heat sink and that was the
first thing I tried for the heat.  The paste merely added another 15-20F to
the whole mess.
Did you get a new mobo?  If so, does it have VIA chipset?  These are garbage
and I'm *never* buying another board with them.  If this is the case, take
it back and find something with SiS chipsets.  I built a system for a friend
that was roughly the same as mine, yet got a different board and it
installed the OS and runs everything without a hitch.
How did I get mine going finally?  Well it took me a couple weeks, but I
finally pinned down the VIA connection after painstaking searching on the
web.  I did not upgrade to the "new and improved" VIA drivers and I did not
install anything that was *not* certified by Micro$oft.  I've never had any
problems ignoring the "MS certified driver" nag box before, but this was the
only thing that actually got my system up and running.

Either way, best of luck.  Computers are great when they work right and
absolute demons when they don't want to cooperate.
