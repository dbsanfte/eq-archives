Or would be if you agreed to it. ;)

Not quite. That term is part of the EULA I just disagreed with; meaning 
I disagreed with the term that said I wouldn't use it if I disagreed 
with it. Cute huh? 

Meanwhile I do own the CD, nobody claims otherwise, and the law doesn't 
prevent me from doing what I want with CDs I own (within the boundaries 
of copyright).

In all seriousness that argument shouldn't really fly. But it 
underscores the grey area that EULAs fall into in terms of being 
inherently weaker than real contracts.

First RPG I encountered actually, before even the venerable D&D.

None of that is on the server though. All the strings of dialog, all the 
models, zonemaps, textures, etc etc... all the "stuff" that is 
"Norrath" is on the client side, and purchased from sony. Even if you 
successfully argued that players couldn't use EQ with an an alternate 
server, you're issue would be with the players, not the server provider.

Suing your players because they aren't buying a tied product (server 
service) ... well that's not the way to improve business.

Is WR a fansite of sorts or a commercial venture? I'd say fansite at 
this point.

I have heard of it. Perhaps I even own copies of the original tech 
readouts along with the "revised" editions. ;) 

The issue there however was that FASA was violating copyright. Copyright 
grants rights over reproduction and distribution. FASA (inadvertantly) 
violated both.

No. Not in this case.

Copyright law grants copyright holders rights over reproduction, 
distribution. Nothing more. It confers no rights to allow copyright 
holders to dictate usage in general.
