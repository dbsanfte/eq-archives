I believe it has been explained to you already.  You provide billing
information, they let you play for 30 days free.  If you decide to cancel
anytime during those 30 days, you are not billed at all.  If you decide to
continue playing, you start paying $12.95 a month for every month or partial
month you play after the free 30 days.  It's pretty simple really.
