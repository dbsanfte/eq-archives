I have a 31st level paladin and created the character really based on
the pulling ability (mainly in LDoN) with lull/calm/pacify.  I had no
idea that they couldn't lull over level 55.

>> The rest of what a paladin brings however, is great.
What exactly is that they add that a warrior can't when fighting mobs
over 55th level?  Just want to be sure I'm not wasting my time with
this toon.  Are they much in demand in groups at high levels?

Cheers.
