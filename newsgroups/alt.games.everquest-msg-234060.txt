Shaman can engage in melee all the way to 65 (unlike a Druid or
Intelligence caster) or perhaps its better to say they can take melee
hits and stand toe-to-toe with a single "slowed" mob. The key to
soloing and melee for Shaman is the "Slow" line of spells. The shaman
class will never dish out high DPS in melee combat (compared to
fighter classes), but with a good weapon can do respectable damage.

Tyical post-14 Shaman solo combat is Root-DoT-Slow-Melee (or some
combination of that). When you hit 34+ and get your pet it is
generally more efficient to let a slowed mob beat on you while dog-dog
chews it up from behind. Dog-dog will never be as good a tank as a
mage or necro pet, so don't plan on using it like one. DoT kiting is
always an option once you get SoW at level 9, but it requires more
effort and wide open spaces with few adds.
