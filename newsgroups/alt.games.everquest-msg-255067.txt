The last patch added crits for berserkers.

Apparantly they start at level 12, need no special training or tome hand 
in.  I've seen someone report parsing them out at about 2.7% increase in 
DPS.

I've seen crits for melee with my two handed slash, I've seen them for 
throwing with my summoned axes, and I've even seen one (just tonight) 
for a frenzy attack.

Since several of the berserker AA and/or Disciplines involve increasing 
crit capability, these seem to have been merely an oversight in the 
creation process.

I had a party member insensed at seeing me with them though, yesterday, 
yelling about how SOE's taken the one remaining thing that makes 
warriors unique.

My high end crit thus far (and its been quite rare they go this high) is 
242 damage, with a 40/40 weapon.  My high end throwing crit (and I get 
it fairly often) is 56, with my summoned axes.  My only frenzy crit I've 
noticed was for 153.

Eye candy to be sure, but given that Berserk are tied to two handed 
weapons only, our eye candy tends to be nice and large when it happens.
