The only skill Id be careful about keeping up to scratch is defense. If you
let that slip, it can be very hard to recover, as you need to fight blues to
train it. The rest of the skills are easy to train if they slip, and youll
know when theyve slipped by the fizzles you get. Melee is easy to train on
snared "fleeing" mobs. Get a crappy fast weapon to switch to for this
perhaps.

I specialised in evoc, but at 55, most of my mana goes in conj spells
(winged death), so theres a case for conj.
