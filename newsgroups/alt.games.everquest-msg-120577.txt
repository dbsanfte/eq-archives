Wizards cant really do that all that well also, they usually can kill something
outright and cant, don't have an instant destroy target ability, and cant keep up
with melees dammage over time due to high mana cost of spells, or slow mana
recovery rates.  No whining, just fact, there broken, prove me wrong

If you want a dammage dealer, the magician is clearly the choice, there spells are
close to the Wizards in effectiveness plus a pet, Magicians can keep up with the
other players in constant dammage output, plus have the fast kill ability, that
you brag about in wizards.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the
gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise
and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that
nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your
gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
