  Being able to hit faster means they can deal out more damage.  Damage
output is one of (The?) main role of a monk.

  I've also heard necromancers complain the proc is somewhat useless.  I
don't know.  But I do know the thing looks absolutely ridiculous.  I would
not bother trying to complete the quest based on the item's appearance
alone.

  The enchanter weapon also looks pretty dumb.  Both the enchanter and the
necromancer weapons look like toys, in my opinion.
