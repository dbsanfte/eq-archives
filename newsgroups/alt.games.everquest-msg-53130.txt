Originally, there were two unless you included Draco in Fear (looks
like a dragon, acts like a dragon, hits like a dragon, hey how about
we call it a dragon).

Then came Kunark giving us Trakanon, The VP 6 and Fish.

Then came Gorenaire, Talendor and Sev-please-gank-me.

That's 11 dragons pre-Velious.

There are 52 named in WW.  Of the 52, 1 is a rhino, 1 is mammoth, 1 is
a wurm, 1 is a drake.  That leaves 48 dragons in WW.

Then you have 4 in Sleepers Tomb (52).
3 in ToV West (55).
1 in ToV East (56).

There's 15 named "bosses" in ToV North, but one is a drake, one is a
wyvern and one is a wurm.  Again, let's count Fish in ToVN as a dragon
(68).

Then we have Yelinak (69).  And Whoashit (70), and Rolandol (71) and
CS Fish (72) and Zlandicar (73).

That I believe is the total number of dragons in the game.  Did I miss
any?
