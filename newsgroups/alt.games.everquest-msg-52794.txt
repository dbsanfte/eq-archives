}basically i want to do this quest with my monk or wizard but they cant get
}into Neriak. only my girlfriends enchanter can.  but the enchanter is only
}24 and cant do the guk or mistmoore part.

I've multiquested a lot of sol ro quests. as long as you both have good 
Sol Ro faction, it should not be a problem. to fix this faction, give derv 
rings to Ortallius in south ro in sets of 4.  High indifferent should be 
enough.
