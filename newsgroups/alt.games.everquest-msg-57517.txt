OK, so I finally got to try out monsters on Test today, spent an hour or
two at it.

Most of that time consisted of hit monster, wait to log in, look at
monster and zone, and log out.

Why?  Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior....

I must have logged in one hundred times, and I got exactly one character
which wasn't a warrior... that was an undead sprite in LFay, which was a
level 6 rogue.... same thing as a warrior only even less options.  Had a
mace, wasn't equipped, I equipped it... but that doesn't make much
difference.

Generally I was in zones which were otherwise empty, and of course I was
unable to zone, or to pick the zone I would come in to, so mostly I just
toyed briefly with the new character model and then logged back out to
try again.

Once I got an orc character... in LFay again, no PCs.

Several times, I found other MPC's to fight, that was marginally more
interesting.

I did level up a rat in WFP from one to two... most often I was unable
to defeat even con mobs, but the level one rat was able to take down
level one snakes fairly regularly.

My rat was attacked by a level 2 wizard, but by turning back and forth
and jumping up and down, I managed to convince her not to kill me.  Best
experience of the night, got to run around as her pet for a while,
attacking her mobs or ones that were adds onto her.  She was unable,
however, to defend me from her fellow players.

I also ran a wolf in to near Halas and convinced the barbarian PC's I
made a good pet... but when a PC Orc came running in, I ended up
sacrificing myself for my "owners"

What else... hmm, I also saw a PC in Oasis actively assembling an "orc
army",
of MPC orcs and other monster mobs, too bad the opposition included
people in their 40s, my little 13 (warrior) dune tarantula had no real
chance.

Sounds exciting... but mostly no, those were the few highlights of two
hours of
mostly 35 second rides on the loading screen.

One good thing, the hotkeys and combat/ability key setups stick with you
for
a given class.. so I didn't have to set up sit, attack, kick hotkeys
again and again.
I did have to do it all over for my one rogue mob.
