No. I've told newbies *not* to do something that would guarantee their
death, which seems to be translated somehow into "Go ye and do this
insane thing as soon as possible, and if you can somehow mung up the
paladin's carefully preserved faction with something along the way, so
much the better". My new answer to "kan u take me to <insert anyplace
at all, really>?" is "No, sorry".
