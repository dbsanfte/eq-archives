Well, this is going to get QUICKLY into class envy, so I won't continue with
it except to say that we have nothing that others can't do better.  The only
feature we have is the combination of a lot of PRETTY good abilities.

We DO have the evacs left, so that point is well taken.

Horrible undoing?  I appear to have overstated my case.  No, I don't believe
it's a horrible undoing, but I DO think it reduces the utility and therefore
the attractiveness and enjoyability of my chosen class, to a very
significant degree.  I also think that when VI does something major like
this to one class, they should come up with something to make UP for it,
instead of just shrugging and telling us to fuck off.  Any bitterness you
detect is aimed at THEM and is the result of years of callous disregard on
their part toward their customers...  This (and the harmony spell) is not a
matter of an ill thought out spell or magic item that they had to nerf a bit
a month or two after releasing it.  This is one of the defining features of
our class, one of the few things we HAD that we could offer our friends, and
had been in place since the game BEGAN.

Well, you probably didn't see my other ports.  Again, it's not about Cash,
I've NEVER pimped ports.  It's not about having something to sell, it's
about having something to OFFER.
