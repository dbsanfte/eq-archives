It's possible that your list is simply maxed out (I don't know if this
happens or not). It's possible that your friend is under some kind of
invisibility (in which case you can only track them if you have a See
Invis type buff). Or, of course, it's possible that the game is just
jerking you around - tracking of other player characters is a
hit-or-miss proposition at best.
