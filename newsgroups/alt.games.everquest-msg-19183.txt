I agree with Bizbee - assuming you've chosen a good password in the
first place, so long as you keep it truly secret there is no
compelling reason to change it.

I'd say that by forcing you to change your password weekly, your
company is actually damaging their security rather than helping it.

Consider - "We're so security conscious, we make everyone change their
passwords weekly". Sounds good at first blush, right? But think about
what happens as a result of this. No one wants to bother learning a
difficult new password every week, so many of them will either start
using simplistic passwords, or they'll write them down in some 'safe'
place. In other words, by forcing people to choose new passwords every
week, you actually damage your security.

Now, if on the other hand, you made everyone pick a good, hard
password, just once, they'd take the time to remember it and they
wouldn't need to write it down. It would be a *lot* more secure.

The secret to good security isn't in torturing employees - it's in
educating them.
