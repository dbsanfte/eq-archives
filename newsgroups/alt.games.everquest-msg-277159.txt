Point blank.

IOW, it's a spell that does damage to all mobs within
X feet of you (the area of effect.)   For Thunderclap
the AOE range is ~20 ft.

1)  You're seeing the effect since it's centered on you.
(IOW, you're looking out through the effect.)

2)  It's impossible to get a "target out of range" since
you're the target.   PBAOE radiates from you, not
from the targeted mob (if you're even required to
target a mob at all.)   "Target out of range" messages
would have to be generated for all *other* mobs in
the zone -- unless they coded another range to limit
it.

It's a PBAOE;  this is how they work.   Unless you've modifed
your UI, it should show you what it is (purple circle around the
gem IIRC.)

I've still no idea what you're saying when you ask "anyone having
trouble casting Thunderclap?"    You're apparently casting it (since
you can see the effect, it drains your mana, etc.)   You just don't
know what it does.

SOE CS doesn't ever answer issues like this one with anything
other than "find out yourself" AFAIK.
