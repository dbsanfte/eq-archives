His story sounds... odd.  However, as your highest level character is
9th, 5pp is a lot of cash.  I'd get the money first, then duel him.  Sure,
you could easily die, a 17 cleric can kick a level 6 druid's butt from
here to Iceclad half a dozen ways.  Why he'd want to is beyond me,
but my point is, all it would cost you would be some time.

Even if he managed to get you killed by an NPC (not all that hard)
since you are 6th level you -still- wouldn't lose any exp.

Walk over to your body, loot it, and then offer to duel him again
for another 5pp, lol.

Cash in advance mind you.
