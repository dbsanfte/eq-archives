http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/factionlist.html

This lists all the factions in EQ. The DE factions are:

Dark Bargainers (merchants)
Dread Guards Inner (guards in commons and 3rd gate)
Dread Guards OIuter (guards in foreign quarter)
Hall of the Ebon Mask (rogue)
Indigo Brotherhood (warriors)
Priests of Innoruuk (clerics)
The Dead (necros and shadowknights)
The Spurned (mages, wizards and enchanters)

Just find the names on the list, and it will tell you who you can kill, who
you can't, and what quests will raise and lower each faction.

There are some other factions in Neriak, but you probably won't have to
worry about them, since there's no one outside of Neriak you have to kill to
lower their faction.
