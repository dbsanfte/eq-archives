You've got a good point.  Somewhere up above this post, someone asked for
legitimate reasons to drop coin.
I provided a couple.

I've been on dragon raids where coin drops were used, in the past, to keep
corpses from rotting (fixed I know).   I've been on dragon raids where coin
drops enabled less familiar "newer" players to group before getting to the
hall and follow us in without us having to worry about them making it to the
hall.

Another point, there are many different computer configurations and some
people get lag and stutter way before others do.  Coin drops make it easier
for everyone, or they did.

I agree to an extent.  Other things can be dropped but you might want to
keep in mind that there are new players and teaching them to raid isn't the
easiest thing in the world to do.  Anything that reduced "baby-sitting" was
appreciated.

Over all, we'll be okay.  Not being able to drop coins isn't a big deal and
if anyone on the raid had to depend on coin drops to find their way around
the "maze" was in the end dead meat.
