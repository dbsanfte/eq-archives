Years ago I made friends with a boy who constantly threatened to kill 
himself.  He's still alive and kicking, and what he *did* end up doing 
was stalking a girl who'd been his friend for as long as I had.  If he 
does need help for something like that, I'm not going there.  I stuck 
with 'helping' the last guy for a very long time and every night I 
talked to him was exactly the same.  Nobody loves me I'm going to kill 
myself why won't any girl sleep with me.

And I don't agree that threats of suicide should *always* be taken 
seriously.  I've seen too many kids who've caught on to the fact that 
because people feel that way, the threat is a good way to get what they 
want.  In this case, the right to force people to talk with him in 
private chat while he demands personal details after an hour's time of 
having seen each other's character's in game.

The warning bell in my case was "my parents don't love me because they 
bought me a computer".

Uh... right, and my parents beat me every night by throwing hundred 
dollar bills my way.

Had he not mentioned 'the same thing' happening in his last guild, *and* 
show up in a new guild quite a bit later, I might have taken it 
seriously.  As it is, I suspect quite a few guilds have and/or will see 
the exact same play being enacted.
