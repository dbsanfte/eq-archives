You need to do quests to get shadowhaven faction up, none of them
will like you(or anyone else) straight out of the box.  I can't think of any
quests a level 5 shaman can do, either.  Wandering away from home at
levels under 6 isn't exactly the sort of behaviour that can be described as
risk free.

An alternative would be to bind there in shadowhaven, then get a druid to
port you to Surefall Glade, where you can run in to Halas to train.

Drum goes in your Secondary slot, with nothing equipped in primary.  I know
this sounds crazy, but there you have it.  I reccomend pulling down primary,
secondary, and two open inventory slots all into your hotkeys, so you always
have the ability to swap around.  Pick up Primary weapon, put that on Drum,
put drum on secondary weapon, and you are good to go... second slot is
for alternate instrument or if you want to stop holding your secondary weapon
on your pointer for some reason.
