Remind me to go home and get out the digital camera and go down and take
some pics in our basement. We keep our wine racks down there and my wife
just finished rearranging them and cleaning up a bit. One pair of them
alone is sitting there with easily sixty bottles of various meads,
ranging from one to five years in age. Many are just traditional meads
varying only in the types of honey and/or yeast used. (She loves to
experiment.) Others are a variety of the fruit types that are flavored
by adding various fruits to the mix. We've made everything from
strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, and raspberry meads to the really
outlandish pineapple, melon, and even *gasp* onion and carrot.

We've also made some really insane apple wines by taking fresh apple
cider and fermenting and aging it. Also a few traditional grape based
wines, but that's never seemed very productive to me given the massive
variety of fine wines available on the market in reasonable price
ranges.
