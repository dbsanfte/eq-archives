I have played several characters since first starting to play EQ, and have
watched the insults come and go throughout this newsgroup in regards to
Druids, along with other classes.

When I decided to create another character to play a different point of
view, I was highly warned against a druid as they are not well accepted in
the game. Personally I love my druid, and attempt to change the attitude
towards them at any chance I get. I usually spend about an hour a game
session to sit at a safe spot and heal, buff, sow and bind. The people I
assist tend to really appreciate it. Others think it is your duty to do
that.

I can honestly say I love the game, and maybe its that reason that I am able
to sit and spend that hour of my time helping others and missing that hour
of time I could be using to gain exp. Yes there are those Druids out there
that think the world revolves around them, BUT there are also warriors,
magicians, and whatnot that think the same. When I joined my guild, one of
the stipulations what that I had to spend some time to assist others and do
good will. I didn't even see this as a stipulation because I did it anyway.
Yes, I accept donations, but I never require them. It would however be nice
to at least recieve a thank you.

I have found myself on a few situations having a character become extremely
upset when I can't buff them or sow them. These times, I am in the middle of
camping with another group. At these times mana is very scarace and it is my
duty to assist teammates first and foremost. If a time arrises that I can
still assist someone then I do so, if I can't then I apologize.

Although many people speak negatively about druids, we are not all selfish
or self-serving. Please remember that next time you are requesting a buff,
or a bind, or a sow or whatnot. Please remember this when you see a druid
announce he or she is seeking a group. At least give that person a chance.
If they act in a negative way. Then get rid of them. Please do not resort to
typecasting and stereotyping.

Ok, Flame away.
