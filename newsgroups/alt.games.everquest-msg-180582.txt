Selling: patty melts still sell pretty well at 1p each in the bazaar (20p 
a stack vs selling a stack to vendor for a plat or so)

Advancing - MUSHROOMS! even if you can't forage mushrooms, buy em in the 
bazaar for 1p each (or befriend a forager who hunts in luclin a lot) and 
make ohabah truffles. Nice stat item that sells decently well in bazaar 
for 2p each. Only "difficult" part to obtain is the brown algae from 
cobalt scar but 10p and a port and you're set. Gets you to 202
