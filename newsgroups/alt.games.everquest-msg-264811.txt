I wonder how many subscribers UO really has now. There's the site
http://pw1.netcom.com/~sirbruce/Subscriptions.html that Bruce Woodcock
maintains but his posts on IGN seem to indicate he's neither as
unbiased nor as informed as he would have people believe (actually, he
came pretty close to kooking out on repeated occasions) and his
numbers on UO are among the most unreliable of them all.

Another telling thing is while you constantly run into people who
mention being current or recent players of every mmorpg under the sun
on various groups and boards, you almost never run into a recent UO
player (though of course many from years past). If there were that
many, surely more would be talking about mmorpgs? I mean, AC was never
very popular and its fans seem to be EVERYWHERE.
