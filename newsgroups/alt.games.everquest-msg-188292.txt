XP pro rocks for eq. I run two of them at the same time with two
instances of EQ/EQwindows on the same desktop.

I was also using 98 until recently, XP pro is a load better. It
manages memory WAYYYY better, using up most of my 768 meg of ram
before using the swap file.

Do like me and leave 98 on the computer, while putting xp into its OWN
(important) partition somewhere on the hard drive(s) By "own" i mean
on a different partition than win 98 is on. I have win 98 on my C:
drive with XP pro on my E: drive and apps that they both use on a D:
drive (all on a 40 gig drive.)
