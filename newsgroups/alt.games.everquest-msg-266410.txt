People often die when they lose control of their car on icy roads.  Are you
going to argue that they committed suicide?

You really aren't very good at semantic arguments.  Stick to saying "I
think" and you might get away with a bit more.  =P

200 years ago, a baby born before 9 months of gestation had small hope of
survival.  A baby born before 7 months had none.

Babies born these days at 6 months regularly survive.  It isn't unheard of
for a baby born at 5 months to survive.

Who knows what medical science will enable in the future.

So go ahead and use your defense that it's a 200 year old definition.  In
200 years, the current defintion will be wrong.  Guaranteed.  With that
knowledge in hand, why would you feel it's a justified definition?

Simple answer.  I had no interest in the rest of your post.  =)

Semantic arguments are not for the weak of heart (or mind).
