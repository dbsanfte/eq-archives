Well to be fair my rogue can tank the PoI/PoJ if he has too, (ie. all other
tanks went afk and some bonehead pulled more than they can handle, or I only
have 1 hour to play and the 2 box is the way to go) but I never want to. I
don't even consider anything outside of PoI/PoJ. (PoD mobs seem to do more
damage to the rogue for some reason)

Martin has a good point, what bonehead rogue uses slash in both hands all
the time? Admittedly if you KNOW you will always be in front of the mob and
you don't have chaotic stab (I think that is right) then sure go with more
damage. But again why do you want to tank? If you are 2 boxing + wife's
druid and don't want to play with others sure go this way. Usually it is
more fun to group with other people as well, in which case you better be
backstabbing. I would like to see some logs, you are probably getting max of
50dps in there, with BS you can easily get 100+ if you are under 55 both
these numbers are lower (I think you posted you were lower, but with your
uberness maybe you are 55+ now)

Why would you play a rogue as a tank? My level 35 ogre warrior takes much
less damage % against hill giants than most rogues I see there that get agro
at that level (and higher) and hill giants are pansies compared to the % of
health planes mobs take per hit.
