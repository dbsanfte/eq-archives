Jaxxe,

CoM reavers are raided on a semi-regular basis on Quellious. This is the case
since 4 classes have epic pieces in this area (ie. ranger, druid, shaman, and
magician). I suggest that you take a day or two and just sit in the zone. You
will find someone quickly that is raiding the reavers and will allow you to
loot the books. The books often rot. I would especially check on a Saturday.
The reavers are raided about 3-6 times on that day.
