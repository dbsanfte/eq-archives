As a lvl 30 enchanter, I just want to make sure I understand what was
happening, to make sure I'm 'doing it right'  Was he mezzing the main's
targeted MOB? I have a assist button setup for the MT/Puller, just so I can
see what MOB is current.  After selecting it, I know what target NOT to
mezz, and mezz the others, either with single target if there are only a
few, or with AoE Mezz if there are a bunch. Correct?
