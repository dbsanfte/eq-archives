My enchanter is level 52.  I really have no trouble in that zone.  But yeah,
I did in my 40s.  Lately we've been hunting there (xp hunting) with at least
2 enchanters.  The rule is, for pulls of 4 or more, "AE mez first, ask
questions later." :)  We don't bother really divvying up the mez
duties...the critter that's beating on the other enchanter is the first one
mezzed, then we just mez what we can target. *shrug*   I like the zone.
It's a hell of a lot easier than ANY Velious zone.
