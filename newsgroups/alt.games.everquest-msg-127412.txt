}Oh, I must have imagined all the Fillipinos that were working there.

Well, there -is- the line that says 'asian' up there.  There's a lot of

Ok I'll try.

Oh, darn.  My keyboard seems to be all stuck.

You're wrolp.

Grr.

You're lromg.

Argh!

I'm wrong.

Ahh well.  I tried, guess that's the best I'm gonna manage. :)

}Shipbuilding, actually.

Oh, here's where you said it.  Got your posts in reverse order. :)

}Did so in another post.

Cool.  Bet that's in reverse order too. :)

Well, maybe.  Sometimes.  That's starting to look like a 3 or 4 sided 
argument though. :)

But when you're feeling ganged up on, there... Go have a look at this here 
page: http://www.adherents.com/rel_USA.html and then consider... 76.5% of 
Americans are Christian. (assuming the CIA didnt run this poll... :) ) 
Why, your team outnumbers all of our teams -combined- by 3 to 1... How 
often do you think we feel exactly as outnumbered as you feel right now?  
So perhaps you can find it in your heart to forgive our enthusiasm when 
the tables are turned. :)
