Back when I was a young dwarf, someone in Gfay gave me a chill dagger.  I
saw it was range and thought "Neat, I have to try this!".  So down the the
forest I went. Found a gaint wasp and hit throw!  .....  I was actually a
little disappointed that a cold freeze beam didn't appear and blast the wasp
like I was expecting.  :-)   I had seen the blade tumbling through the air
and killing the wasp so I went over the loot the corpse and get my neat
chill dagger back... :-)   "WHAT!, It's not here!"   "DOH!"    so that was
how I learned about putting stat items in the range slot. hehe

what a newb.
