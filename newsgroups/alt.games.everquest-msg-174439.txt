What do you mean by "pushing" guarantees?  They ask me if I want an extended
warranty, and I say "no" and that ends it, just like everywhere else I shop.
The big problem with Best Buy is that the store is too damn loud.  It's
nothing like, say, Fry's, but it is still too loud.  Instead of constantly
blasting over the PA system for employee Soandso to come to department
Whatever, they should fit the employees with wireless headsets or something.

Anyway, I live in a small town.  My choices are Best Buy and Circuit City
for electronics, Best Buy and two Gamestops and Electronic Boutique for PC games
(although one GS and EB are in the mall, which I don't like (oh, there's a
Wizards of the Coast in the mall, too, which also has PC games), and for
console games there are all of those places and a Toys'R'Us.  There's a
Target which has some stuff too, but not really a big selection.

In terms of one-stop shopping, Best Buy is the best of these.  It's got a
better selection of PC games than any of those others, the second best
selection of console games for current consoles (Circuit City is best), the
best selection of CDs and DVDs, and the best electronics selection.
