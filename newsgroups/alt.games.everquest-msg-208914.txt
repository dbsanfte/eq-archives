From my logs....
[Fri Mar 28 19:35:06 2003] You say, 'what second rank skullcap'
[Fri Mar 28 19:35:07 2003] Master Xydoz says 'Looking for the second rank
skullcap?  Look no further, but be prepared to earn it.  I seek a [faded
tapestry].  Now, too, so do you.'
[Fri Mar 28 19:35:14 2003] You say, 'what faded tapestry'
[Fri Mar 28 19:35:14 2003] Master Xydoz says 'I have heard reports of such
a thing found upon sarnak hatchlings.  They must have scampered from the
safety of their dwelling with their master's property.  I would like to
see this tapestry, but only when it has been mended.  I need to find a
necromancer who is [adept at tailoring].'
[Fri Mar 28 19:35:24 2003] You say, 'i am adept at tailoring'
[Fri Mar 28 19:35:25 2003] Master Xydoz says 'If you are a member of the
Brood and wish to assist, you may seek out this tapestry.  Find the torn
and ripped pieces and take them both to a sewing kit.  Return with the
mended tapestry and your first rank skullcap and I shall see that you are
rewarded with coin and a second rank skullcap.'

Both parts drop off Sarnak Hatchlings in LOIO. Combine in a loom or sewing
kit. If you fail the combine, you get one of the NO DROP, LORE pieces back.
Give the combined tapestry and 1st Rank Skullcap to Xydoz for 2nd Rank
Skullcap.

I didn't start making cash til I postponed skullcap quests for a bit and
went to Field of Bone. The Curscale armor quests, while they don't get you
armor you can use, sell for a decent amount of cash. I also made a fair
amount farming the spiderlings in the Bonebinder Warrens in Field of Bone.
