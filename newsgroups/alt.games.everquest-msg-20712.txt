The United States Supreme Court has never even HEARD a case involving a
EULA, let alone ruled against one.

Feel free to prove me wrong.  Here's a link to help you:
http://www.supremecourtus.gov/

Here's a clue though:  whether or not a EULA has a legal hold, you MUST
follow that EULA or do one of the following:
- Quit using the software
- File suit against the software maker
- Accept punishment

It really isn't hard to understand.
