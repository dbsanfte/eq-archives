So, let me get this right, you were in a zone atleast 2 zonelines away from
PoK, as a port class, not /anon, not /role, and you got a tell for a service
that is fairly unique (only two classes do it).  You complain about this
why?  IMO, that's like being a being a cleric, and griping about people
asking for a rez, it's part of your class.  Now granted, the person
requesting the ride could have phrased it a bit differently, but your gripe
was about laziness, not rudeness.
