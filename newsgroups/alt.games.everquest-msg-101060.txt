I'm a newbie Gnome Wizard and am having a very big problem.  With my LV8
spells costing me 4pp each I'm having a problem trying to get enough to
cover the cost (almost to LV5).
    The mail quest is good, but takes me almost 40 minutes.  Start in
Akanon, drop letter off at Kelethin, go to docks in BB Mountains to get #2,
then to Kaladin to get letter 3, then gate back to Steamfront mountains just
outside Akanon and repeat.  I turn in 3 letters, spending nearly 40 minutes,
only to get about 11-17 gold each time.
    Is there a faster way to quest for cash?  And also what about increasing
my faction dramatically so I will be better than indifferent and get better
prices buying and selling?
    Any help would be much appreciated.
    Also I'm trying that quest where you give Sanfyrd the scrap metal from
the runaway clockwork (spiders).  I can't find the guy though.  I've read he
is across from the mines, but I've looked and the room is empty except for a
merchant and two mechanics.
