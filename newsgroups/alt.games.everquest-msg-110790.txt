Well, yes, but not everyone is aware of the existance of Trader's Bags.  I 
know I wasn't until the day *after* I spent 700pp buying 8 tailor-made 
10-slot packs.  I thought about being upset, then realized that 700pp is a 
pittance, and the 25% increase in my available bankspace made me a very 
happy bard.  I flagged down the nearest dorf cleric, made him summon me a 
couple stacks of ale, and got drunk so I didn't care anymore.  
I consider myself pretty clued-in when it comes to EQ, but had I not seen 
the post here about the trader's bags, I still wouldn't know of them.
