I got my hands on a few of the Fungus Beast Glands that have a click effect 
of a low duration snare.  It makes soloing so much more trivial.  I now 
understand why druids find soloing, prequadding so easy.  No more worrying 
about casting those dots from the maximum range, and keeping lots and lots 
of open space for running.  Unfortunately, I used up all the charges, and 
am back to either getting smacked around a bit, or keeping lots of open 
space handy.
