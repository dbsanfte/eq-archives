Knights of Truth are the Freeport Paladins, who pull guard duty in the
north of the town. Militia are the rank and file guards you find in east
and west Freeport and the commons. The docks are guarded by militia and
NFP and the bank is guarded by KOT, strictly a zone thing, so yes you
can avoid the one faction you are KOS with. If you need to get NFP when
you're KOS with militia, and vice versa with KOT, there are always the
tunnels under FP. If you are at least dubious, you will be safe from
being attacked, although yes, there are other NPCs around on different
factions. The bards are all in NFP, so no need to worry about them, but
there are other NPCs, like a ranger in the Hogcaller inn, who will
probably attack you on sight. If you don't go into the buildings you
should be safe enough I would guess.

Incidentally, there is a secret entrance into the tunnels in WFP - these
will take you into EFP and right under the dock as an option, although I
believe you'll have to run past the FP rogues to get to the dock
(Crimson Hands maybe? or is that the Qeynos rogues?), and they will be
on different faction again.
