The warders drop some of the best loot in the game.   Once the sleeper is
woken, some of the weapons are still available, albeit at a greatly reduced
drop rate.   Some things, such as the Gnome form Illusion mask, will never
drop again.  If you're in a guild that is ToV capable, and trying to get your
people outfitted enough to take on the North Wing nameds... Sleepers was where
you wanted to be for melee weapons and such.

Both.  When he awakes, he immediately begins killing everyone in Sleepers
Tomb.   Dragons everywhere in the world, Vox, Nafagen, Phara Dar, Yelniak, all
spawn, if they are not already alive.   They begin shouting to thier
respective zones to beware, that the horror of the Sleeper is coming, or
something close to that.
Once Kerafym (the sleeper) finishes up with the raid that killed the warders,
he zones out to East Wastes and beings killing everyone there.   He makes his
way over to Skyshrine zone by zone, where he kills Yelniak, the boss dragon.

At that point, he usually despawns.   Supposedly that is not the end of the
script, and he is supposed to continue his rampage in West Wastes and the
Temple of Veeshan, but the script is a bit messed up apparently.

For permanent effects, there are some new quest dragons in West Wastes, and
the changes to Sleepers Tomb itself.  I dont' know as much about those, but
they're more extreme.

Bloody Kithicor would be the most famous.   When the game first came out,
there were no undead there... just a level 1 - 15 newbie area.   I can't think
of many others offhand, but there have been many semi-permanent changes... as
in the zones were left in thier altered states for months before returning to
normal.  (Corruption of Lesser Feydark, the Plague on the Karanas, etc.)
