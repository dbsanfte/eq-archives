Excellent change, much more informative for my bazaar mule, a 34 druid, who's
constantly called on to look for spells for my 65 cleric, 57 bard, 51 shaman, 30
enchanter... yes, I searched for Enchanter items with the word Spell in them, I
-know- I can't cast it but the question is, is it one the chanter can cast or
isn't it?

I still wish they'd put the "minimum level to proc" on items, though, thats more
of a mystery, I can download spell listings for each class.
