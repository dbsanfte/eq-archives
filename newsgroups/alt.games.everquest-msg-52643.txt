Doesn't have to be a caster either.  I've passed by the odd lowbie and
offered to finish it once it got below half.  At 45%, I'll hit my Attack
macro but sometimes I've been using the one that leads with a backstab.  The
stab does more the lowbie did and inadvertently robs him of the xp (but
usually gets him a plat or so as an apology, and a taunter for his next
prey).
