Standard response is Marus Seru to high 20's, then DSP. Other answers
include High Hold Keep - some of the best xp in the game, but way over
camped on most servers and has to be one of the most repititious and
therefore boring camps in the game too (individual xp for each kill is
simply AMAZING, but you'll kill a couple, then wait forever, then kill a
couple, then wait forever).

My new place of choice is quickly becoming Echo Caverns if I can get a few
peeps together to go in there.
