I'm planning on getting a new computer in the new future. I've heard bad
things about Win XP and Everquest, and good things about Win 98 and EQ.
Any other OS's out there that I should avoid/go for? I'll probably end
up getting some version of Windows (sigh) because I need a pre-built
system and I'm just not that system-savy. I'd be more than happy to stay
with 98, but I'm afraid of running into some issues with newer software
down the road, since this computer is going to be in use for some time
to come. Any thoughts?

Thanks in advance.
