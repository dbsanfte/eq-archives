Didn't read the whole post, and I tried to make it clear that I was joking
about the wolf killing thing, with my comments on killing bears.  That being
said however, if I were roleplaying my druid, then, personally, I would not
run around killing every wolf and bear, but that is just a personal choice
on how I would roleplay it, not something that I would expect everyone to
conform to.
