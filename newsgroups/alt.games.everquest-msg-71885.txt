I have seen it broken down this far.  Not something I disagree with, really. 
Just that the practical differences between hybrids and pure melees,
particularly in reference to "caster items" or "melee items," are minimal. 

In broad terms, if a ranger can and would want to use it, a warrior can use
it; if a shaman can and would want to use it, a cleric can use it; and if a
wizard can and would want to use it, a magician can use it.  Excluding
class-specific items (which then wouldn't be "caster" but "necro" items) and
the restrictions they put on items against rangers and monks often and other
classes occasionally.
