Use the right mouse button and *click* on the top of your main chat window 
then use the left mouse button to click on the words "New Chat Window.".

A new window will appear.  Use the right mouse button and click on the top 
of THAT window, then click on "Filters" with the left mouse button, then 
click on "Guild" with the left button.

The words may not be exact, but they are close.
