The Tactic I'm refering too is simple

Cast pet
buff pet
attack
as mob gets about to die 'Reclaim energy' getting rid of pet (preferably
with root)
Nuke till dead (should only take one if done right)

Never used this tactic myself but have heard of ppl who have. Although I
have read many many things written by other ppl and I think I've only heard
of this once or twice. Stuck out in my mind as waste.

And on a personal note... I've always just invis'd to get rid of pet I don't
want *Shrug* Never have used reclaim energy and not sure if I will laugh.
Unless you get your daggers back which I'm perty sure you don't.
