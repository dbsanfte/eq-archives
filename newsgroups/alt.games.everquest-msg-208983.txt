Ohhhh...right...I saw that on track pretty much the entire time we were
there, and casually wondered if it was named, but with our currently setup
I had all that I could handle.  Is he significantly tougher than a 58
revenant then?

Actually, no, I could be talking out of my ass there, since I haven't
camped him myself yet.  Wanted to be level 65 first.  But since his belt
sells for 70k on my server, compared to 25 of soulscream, I figured he
*had* to be more worthwhile!
