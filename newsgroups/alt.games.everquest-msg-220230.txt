Just on a lark, I framed my questions as I play various charcters in certain
games:
Originally I myself got James T. Kirk
Tyas, EQ Dark Elf Enchanter: Palpatine (I'm a baaaad baaad boy)
Tyar Eyurn, EQ Gnome Mage: Obi Wan Kenobi (HUH??)
Tyas Duskchaser, SWG Smuggler/Master Artisan: One question 'he' had no
opinion on. One way I got Borimir, the other Boba Fett ( Everyone dies...
but since no one has paid me to kill you... sleep well. ).

Zook Murnig, one of my recent D&D p&p characters (Gnome Wizard of blowing
things sky high):  Severus Snape (odd...)

Chesser, another one of my D&D chars (Human Cleric): urrr Luke Skywalker.
