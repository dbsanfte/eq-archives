At 65 many of the mobs in PoF are light blue. I think they raised the light
blue experiance spread because I rememeber before that some were green even.
In any case its pretty mild and you can invis in without aggroing anything.
At least I had to do CR solo there once and did not get any aggro invis
while un-invis I aggroed about a dozen mobs just standing at zone in. So I
dont see how having just one group go in and attract the attention of the
main swarm could hurt.
