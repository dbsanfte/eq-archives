i still thinks its classic what i did  more than once, is mem personal  gate
spells instead of  circle spell and  im grouped with the guys and i have
the pay up front policy unless im going  somewhere  for personal reason then
its free and i gate and the person wanting the port asks where i went,
pretty funny lol
