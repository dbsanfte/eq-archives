I wouldn't rule out them giving a lot more attention to EQ1 in the upcoming
months.  Consider current MMORPG subscription levels:

EQ1: 430k.  This is down from their peak of around 460k about six months
ago.  Last two expansions haven't really boosted them.

DAoC: 250k.  Last two expansions gave them boosts.  Next expansion (major
revamp of the frontiers) should probably give another boost.

SWG: Around 275K (and probably heading down).

FFXI: 500k.

UO: 230k.

Everything else available in North America is under 100k.

If anything should have ever been a sure thing, it was SWG, and yet it only
got 275k.  For anything else, that would be good...but with the wider
audience that a Star Wars game can draw from, that's gotta be way lower than
they expected.  They probably expected it to be the first to break a
million.  The lesson here is that there aren't any sure things in the MMORPG
world.

I'd bet there are some high ups in Sony looking at the subscription levels
for EQ1, and for other company's games, and then looking at SWG's numbers,
and thinking 430k EQ1 subscribers are a very valuable asset, and there is no
guarantee that EQ2 will do well (after all, it doesn't have the built-in
widespread potential audience that SWG had--it's built-in appeal is to EQ1
players).  If anything is going to cannibalize EQ1, it is EQ2.  Worse, there
might be a lot of half-cannibalizations...that is, EQ2 gets EQ1 players
thinking seriously about switching, then they realize that if they can give
up EQ1 to start over in EQ2, they can give up EQ1 to start over in WoW or
some other game.

They basically either need to treat EQ2 as a competitor to EQ1, and respond
the same way they would if EQ2 were not a Sony game, or they need to treat
it as the replacement to EQ1, and find a way to migrate everyone over without
making them start over.  The systems are different enough that I don't think
they want to go near the latter option.
