I'm shocked to hear that anyone capable of thinking about KT
would go to a raid with spell effects turned on.

From back in my Vox days up thru about 55, nearly every
raid one of the major talking points of the raid leaders
was how to turn off almost every optional effect you
could think of, in order to prevent you lagging out
or going LD with a couple dozen people hitting you
up with all their special effects.

By now, no-one mentions it, but its not because the
need to do so has reduced, its just that its assumed
that by the time you are 55+ you have been on so
many raids you know the drill.

Last time I had particle effects on was the recent
patch when they were thrust upon me, and I had
to go in and monkey until I got them all to go away
again!.  After all, they don't do anything good for
me when I'm soloing or grouping, and they DO
tend to make me much less valuable in a raid.

Only thing I change is clip plane, being able to see
things far from me is useful, and makes the game
much more visually appealing for me.  So it goes
up as high as possible (some zones, thats not to
the limit, but most it is) and at raid time, I turn
it down to near the bottom of the bar.
