>Beastlord: Pet CHeal er I mean pet level up line

Nope. For the Beastlord the one spell I couldn't do without is SoW

I have never used the Pet level Buff for it's bugged CHeal effect. OK
I did do it once by mistake (I forgot to switch out the pet level buff
with pet heal spell), but due to the long casting time the pet died
and I had to run to the zone. After level 22 the mana cost for the pet
level buff and the casting time make it very inefficient for a BL to
use.

The standard pet heals are incredibly mana effecient and are fairly
quick to cast. (60% heal for 12% mana for example with my wisdom at
98)

I REALLY hope that VI fixes the CHeal bug with the spell. The mana
cost is brutal. Buffing the pet up after zoning usually takes 50-70%
of my mana bar at level 39. Until the bug is fixed there is no way
that they can lower the mana cost. It would give BLs too much power.
