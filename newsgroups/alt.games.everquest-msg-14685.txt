Well, firstly I like having NG specific filters.  Right now in alt.2600
there is some moron using trojans to do a pedoporn spam-flood.  The
filters used to block that are 100% effective at blocking the flood, but
they are also blocking legitimate posts.  I wouldn't want serverwide
filters.  

Second, refering to OE as a "real newsreader" is either comic or tragic.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
