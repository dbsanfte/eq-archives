Giggling maniacally and surrounded by armed hamsters, "John Kievlan"

Allow Saudi Arabia and the rest self government and stop making their
rights secondary to the multinationals and the corrupt puppet
leadership currently in place.

Stop supporting everything Israel does, no matter what it might be.

In the meantime, make the arabs aware of how much better life is when
its modernized. This takes time. It's the hard road. You will still
have to punish the religious extremists from time to time.

But you don't kill religious extremism by knocking down its house. You
destroy it by showing them a better one. Then they leave on their own.
Eventually. This is the very reason for the rise of Christianity in
the first place (initially).

Remember: arabs are humans too. They were our friends once, for real.
They can be again.

With no political and  economic excuse to hate the US left, all your
left with is the fringe element unsupported by any resources (which
are only available when rich elements - who come from the
economic/political side - support them).

It's not easy. First, its bad for Israel. Well they should have
thought of that before burning as many bridges in their smugness they
they did. Second, its bad for arabs in the short term, because right
now they're in a fervor of dislike for the US and fervor leads to
extemism. Last, its bad for the interests of those with investments in
the area, which unsurprisingly include much of the current
administration.

But its good for the US both short term and long. Not having arabs
hate the West, other than the etreme religious fringe, is a good
thing. A penniless terrorist isn't nearly as much of a threat and
there are closer, more dangerous religious problems than Christianity
anyways. It's good for the Arabs in the long term, as they get to be a
part of the world rather than having to fight it lumped in with their
extremists.

There's part of the problem, yes.

As the massively negative world opinion of American neo-imperialism
shows, however, your beliefs aren't shared by very many.

*shrug* You get that now no matter what. The raw new recruits don't
matter; there won't be any end to those for the forseeable future
because they hide in countries the US won't attack. What matters is
their support, political and financial.

Do you think that means they will stop trrying? What planet do you
hail from? I don't think that has ever happened.

Remember the goal is to stop the terrorism.

Doing what al Qaeda wants is not accurate. Stop doing what no arab
likes is better. Al Qaeda is the extremist fringe, but the common arab
isn't a violent suicide bomber saying "Islam or death!"

Um, no they weren't. There were a few who did, obviously, but no one
minds removing religious extremism.

This would be more of that media propoganda that is so much of the
problem.

Rubbish.
