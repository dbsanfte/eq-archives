Paul we might as well give up. One says while he has read a lot, and
concedes that he has his facts incorrect, that his basic arguments are still
right, even with wrong facts.

The other sits and defines terror whatever way fits his own position on the
subject.

They will now just sit here and bray the same thing over and over until we
all give up, thereby they can claim victory and moral superiority over the
rest and thus give them the thumbs up that what they have concluded is
right.

Pity, while wanting to vent over the symptoms they have no need to find the
root cause of what is happening and try to resolve it.

Gramma called it trying to teach a pig to whistle. All you do is get tired
and it annoys the pig.
