I Symbol the tanks. If the enchanter there asks, or the necro asks, I will
symbol them too. Everyone gets Heroic bond and Sheild of Words. I've been in
groups where even the druid asks for Symbol. And sometimes, I do. But at 55,
it's easier just to give everyone Marzin, simply because it does last
longer. The groups I hunt with automatically hand over most gems to the
cleric. And sometimes they give me peridots. I do not even carry Jasper any
more. But I also split my rez money with my groups - if I rez while in a
group. It's their time too, so I share it.
