|LOL!
|Oh yeah. They're almost as nerfed as the Druids.

|Necros. Oh man. That's priceless.

	Uh, no, sorry.  We're completely serious.

	Before a number of changes, particularly the one that fixed the weapon
delay issue for pets, Necromancers were unstoppable.  As in, a single
character *pre-Kunark* holding down four named spawns in Lower Guk.

	No one said that they weren't still powerful -- only that they're the most
nerfed.  It is a testament to the power of the class that even after multiple
nerfings they are still, easily, hands-down, the single most powerful class in
the game.
