So, you knew paladins or shadowknights who were being refused groups
because of the original Mark of Karn?

No?  Good, neither did I, and my main was a cleric back when that nerf
came through.  It still happened, and that was their reasoning behind
it.  All that needs to happen is the perception that this is
happening, and there are enough people posting on this thread who are
apparently willing to believe this.

And yes, I do believe what I wrote.  If mentioning that you have KEI
makes you more likely to get a group, then it follows that not having
KEI makes you less likely to get a group.  That creates the trend and
the perception, especially as KEI gets more prevalent, that KEI
becomes compulsory for grouping at those levels.  From my own
experiences in crowded lowbie zones, I'm finding that it's becoming
more and more necessary if you want someone to take you for their
group.

And it doesn't matter how easy it is to get.  It doesn't matter that
there are always three dipshit enchanters in the nexus who are always
handing it out "for donations" which can go as low as 2pp.

What matters is that no one at Sony can possibly be so obtuse as to
suggest that it's perfectly reasonable to expect players to get a buff
from a character 45 levels higher than them in order to play and enjoy
the game.

And no, they don't want those people to go solo instead.
