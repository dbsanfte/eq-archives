Ok, a few corrections, he was from Snoqualmie, not Issaquah and I 
apparently confused the earlier hacking a year ago where they DID
get user information. Looks like the teen did not get user info.
 
 I do believe he was arrested though.
 
 In any event, like I said, they always get caught sooner or later.
That was my main point.
