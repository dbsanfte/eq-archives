Personally I believe this is caused because you cant solo effectively in 
EQ2. People are joining groups not because they want to group but because 
they HAVE to group to progress.

If this wasn't the case then you would have people looking for groups who 
genuinely enjoy playing as a group and all of what that entails.

As it is now you just have a huge amount of solo style players wanting to 
group to complete quests and collect chests, none of which you can do 
without a group. It's the fault of SOE for trying to force a game style on 
players instead of allowing them to do their own thing.
