I sell at the 75 plat per sheet price (I used to sell at 100 plat per
sheet), with a small surcharge on the harder pieces to round them up to a
multiple of 50 (BP and Cloak).  (I remove the surcharge if I'm doing a
complete suit.)

Anybody who says "I can get it for xxx, you're charging too much", I simply
thank them for the info, and then ask them when did I ask for their opinion.
I also point out that I've never failed to sell my wares at my price.
(Which is a lie.  I made a belt one time that I couldn't find a buyer for in
3 months.  Finally sold it to a vendor.)

A word of advice:  HALF IN ADVANCE.

For anything I make, I get paid half the price in advance.  If the person
doesn't pony up half the cash, I don't do the work.  People have tried
showing me that they've got all sorts of expensive gear, they've tried
showing me that they have the cash, they've tried showing me they've got
stuff they swear is worth more than what I'm asking.  No matter.  Half in
advance before I put hammer to metal.

For those who squawk that I'm expecting them to risk the cash, the answer is
"you're expecting me to risk all of the raw materials".

I've had a few people say that I'm asking for cash in advance in order to
rip them off.  My immediate response to them is "full price in advance".  If
they say it again, my response is "go find another smith".

For those who say they won't pay anything in advance, I tell them to find
another smith.  If they've been polite, I give them the name of the only
other regularly-practicing smith I know.  Unfortunately for them, he also
requires half payment in advance.

Once I have an order, I repeat the order to the client as a question.  When
they answer Yes, I take a screenshot.

I've only ever had one person complain to me that I didn't do the work he
wanted.  When I asked him how much he paid me in advance, he was unable to
tell me.  (He also wouldn't tell me the name of his character that put the
order in, curiously enough.)

Another word of advice:  CASH IS KING.

Unless it is for a specific item for which I know I have a use, I only work
for cash.  I don't care if XXX is worth twice what I'm charging.  Sell it,
give me my price, and you'll still have the rest of the cash, plus the item
I've made for you.

An exception:  If I'm *absolutely 100% guaranteed rock-solid certain* that
the item you're offering is worth more than what I'm asking, then I *might*
do the work for trade.  However, since I don't know the value of 95% of the
items that are out there, the odds are pretty low.  Of course, with the
"half in advance" rule, I get the item before I make the armour (hard to get
half the item in advance).  This almost invariably stops the person wanting
to make the trade cold in his tracks.

Despite the above rules, I have a couple of repeat customers.  Funny thing
is, they ask the price, then almost invariably pay me full in advance.  For
them, I'd accept doing the work in advance, as they've proven themselves.  I
guess that's why they pay the full in advance.  They know I'm honest and
I'll do the work in as timely a fashion as possible, so instead of having to
keep track of half payments, they simply get it over with.


I still do banded work, but as I'm focussing on FP (and soon Cultural) I use
a different rule.  I'll do the work for free, IF the client brings me ALL of
the raw materials and the recipe.  99% of the requestors immediately go
looking for another smith; it's too much trouble for them to get the
materials.
