Indoor zones such as Unrest or Paludal (but enter PC from the Shadowhaven
end to avoid the crowds).

The way to PL with your beastlord would be to buff/regen/haste the ranger,
then pull mobs with a slow and just let the mob beat on you until the ranger
gets in enough hits to take the aggro. Long as you don't do any damage to
the ranger, she'll get all the exp from the kill.
