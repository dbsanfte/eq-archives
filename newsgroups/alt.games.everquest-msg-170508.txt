That's not how it seemed to work for me.  Maybe it's not unlimited, but
merely fast enough as to seem unlimited before I ran out of patience.  :)

It could be similar to magician pets regenning health *much* faster when
they aren't engaged in a fight.  In constant fighting, even if a magician
pet is taking no damage it will take forever to heal up.  A few minutes with
no fighting and the magician pet will be at full health.
