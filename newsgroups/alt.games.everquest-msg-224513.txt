< snip smoulderings of a gender debate >

The fact of the matter is, I don't have any trouble at all with people 
playing characters of the opposite sex in the interests of role-play. I 
don't get the desire to do so, but I don't see that as any reason to think 
it's wrong.

Unfortunately, I have experienced those who do so (and many that I've 
suspected) for the cyber or lewd aspects, and that just tends to provide a 
negative influence on my opinion on the matter where I had little opinion 
to begin with.

My apologies if I've offended anyone.
