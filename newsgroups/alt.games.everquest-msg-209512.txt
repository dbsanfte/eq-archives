No faction on some of the Frogs and the faction on the others (if
they flee at low HPs expect a faction hit) appears to be base KoS for
everyone with no way to raise... 

"Oh nos! I'm even more kos to a Frog I was kos to all along!"

The NPCs at PoS zone in ARE factioned and will assist the Frogs so
you probably won't want to aggro them.   Liberal doses of HoN and a
little care mean you can even pull Frogs from inside the cave.

You can also charm the Bears, Dillos etc in PoS but they aren't
anywhere near as useful as a Frog.
