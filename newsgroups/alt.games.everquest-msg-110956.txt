Whether intentional or not, I believe you misunderstand my question.  Of
course there should be laws to regulate certain actions that would be
illegal in and of themselves.  On the other hand, I don't want the
government telling me what I can sell (as long as it's legal), who I can
sell it to (as long as they're of age), or who I -must- hire.  And I
certainly don't want a bunch of bearucrats applying "regulations" as they
see fit, in order to punish one business or promote another.

Case in point: airbags.  The government mandated that they be installed.  I
see it has having no right to do so.  If I want to buy a car with no
airbags, that's my choice.  Now that they've been shown to be dangerous to
segments of the population, the governement will be magnanimous and "allow"
us to disable them.  Gee thanks, Big Brother, you're really swell.
