Normally, if DX8 is the problem it'll be more severe, like not running EQ at
all as soon as it is starts to perform anything with 3d graphics.
In your programs folder (dir) you'll find DXdiag, try running that, although
I have yet to see it give me an error, even when I am certain the problem is
with DX.

I'd actually suggest uninstalling the detonator drivers and installing the
manufacturers ones, I know people who had problems with the Detonator ones
and EQ.
