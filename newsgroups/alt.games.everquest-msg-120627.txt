Ever hear the old saying, " ..only a fool believes half of what he sees,
and even less of what he reads " ?

Oh waaaa. Who cares ? I try and conduct myself in accordance with 
my own values in and out of the game and don't give a rat's ass how
the ' community ' is portrayed in the media. If the mainstream media
wants to see dysfunction at it's very best, they can look in a mirror.
They're all about selling soap, and not worth the time of day.
