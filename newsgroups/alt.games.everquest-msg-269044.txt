I have to agree, I didn't see a whole lot of deliberate KSing, in the 
long run.  Probably less than ten occaisions in 5 years of playing.  The 
places where it was famous, though, say the AC in SRo, though, are 
places I just avoided as not worthwhile.

This, though, I did see.  A lot.  I saw it, I was PLed, I PLed people. 
I think, in the long run, that it was bad for me and for the game; it 
meant we weren't facing things on our own power, we were instead using 
massively overpowering force to bypass content.  A game with 70 levels 
in it, but you skip over 50 of them... is really only a game with 20 
levels of content.

How you can consider -not- getting PLed to be a "lame" way of doing 
things, is beyond me.

I enjoyed PLing, don't get me wrong; I don't think its necessarily lame. 
  Particularly not when, as you suggest, you are just helping a friend 
to catch up a bit so you can play together.  But allowing for this 
limited case means leaving the gate wide open for far more blatant cases.

While an actual "bot"; a character played entirely automatically by 
macros, is rare, I frequently saw people playing a second character who 
was not grouped but who could be used to buff their current character 
and group.  I even did the same, on a single account, by logging off my 
current character, logging in an alt who would cast the buffs on my 
group or partner, then logging the current character back in; this meant 
my current character wasn't included in the buff, but still benefited 
from being grouped with people who were.

The most extreme case of this, of course, are the people who sit around 
in POK casting long duration buffs on people they aren't grouped with 
and don't even have alts grouped with; they aren't involved in the play 
of those people they are buffing in any direct way at all.  Yet its a 
rare person who's playing up above 46 who hasn't on occaision recieved 
buffs from those people.

Why is it bad?  Well, you didn't get into that question, skipping over 
it by claiming that it doesn't exist... which is nonsense.

Its bad for the same sort of reason that PLing is bad and twinking is 
bad; it means people are doing things they can't do on their own, 
borrowing power from others, and thus trivializing the content and 
shrinking down the game.  And its bad because it means you -don't- seek 
out the characters who can provide those buffs and adventure with them; 
KEI meant enchanters were less desirable, Virtue meant clerics were less 
desirable, and so on.  When the characters are balanced in part around 
what they can do for the group, and you take away part of what they can 
do by substituting better versions of the same from a buffer who isn't 
in the group at all, you weaken the contribution of those characters.

I can certainly see a point to what you are saying, that this solution
is throwing out the baby with the bathwater... but I have to disagree 
with you if you try to claim that the bathwater itself isn't dirty. 
There -are- negative aspects to the things that EQ2 is preventing, as 
well as possible positive ones, you have to weight each and decide where 
the final balance lies.  EQ1 went with full interaction, EQ2 has more 
cloistered play in an attempt to stem the abuses we saw in EQ1; only 
time will tell if doing so drives away more players than it attracts.
