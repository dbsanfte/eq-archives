VAT is a tax on the provider/vendor - they already pay various corporate
taxes and this is just another one of them....its got nothing to do with
restrictions on the internet for users - not least because it has 
absolutely no relevance to any free or public website. All these ISPs
already pay taxes all over the place just for existing - this is no
different and so introduces no 'restriction spectre' its simply already
existing taxes on goods and services entering the country catching up with
the electronic age - its not like intellectual property law and crossing
borders hasnt been having a massive effect on various providers already.

Basically the costs for operating into the EU have gone up for Sony
(someone with no base here could probably tell the EU where to get off and
not bother levying but Sony is a multinational) and its being passed
on....it would require a great deal of International law qualifications
and practise to sit down and determine if what Sony is doing is exempt and
need a lot of court time...it cheaper and easier for the multinational to
simply pay the tax and bill the cost to the consumer.

Yeah its costing me more, yes I can see an argument that this isnt really
a service crossing a border (though it might affect the California law
only clause in the EULA some given SOE have accepted the taxation issue)
but all these are horrendously nebulous and need expert scrutiny which
will undoubtedly happen in businesses and drop down to us consumers - but
then hands up those of you who actually get a thrill out of paying taxes
at the point of forking out the cash (as opposed to using the servces
provided)
