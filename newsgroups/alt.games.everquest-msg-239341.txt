Yeah but... look at the asshole its turned you into.

All you do in this group is critisize everyone, you're right and the
*entire* world is wrong, regarding what color the sky is, what eq should be
like, what my dog's poop smells like..


Do you work for sony or something? it wouldnt surprise me at all if we one
day learned you and bizbee BOTH are their "customer service" department
heads. as much defending of it as you do, and attacking ANYONE who
complains.



Yeah I know DT, you have no idea what im talking about, but you are almost
certain im an idiot.  (see, I know exactly what you're going to say)
