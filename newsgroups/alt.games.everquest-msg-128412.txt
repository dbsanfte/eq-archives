My char name is isac on the eci server, and I belong to the exiled deities
guild.

the other day someone was talking about september 11th and saying how it's
america's fault about the whole incident, and that it's because of people like
me that the incident happend in the first place. they said the united states is
a haven for jewish people and that they polute our country. "they sure as hell
don't want them in israel. so why would we want them here?" 

then someone on the morning of the forth of july, walked in and started
shooting people in lax airport, at the el al airline ticket counter. 

how could such people do things and say things such as this??? don't the have
any decency in them what so ever? 

I am proud to be jewish and will never be scared of someone threatening my
life. they can say whatever they want on everquest. but if they ever dirrect it
towards me, I'm gonna tell them how it is reguardless of who I might offend, no
matter the consequence. 

peace out.

ps. 
my char name is my real name.
