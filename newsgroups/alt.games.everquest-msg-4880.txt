If you can get to the server list and your server had the word "DOWN" or 
"LOCKED" near it, then it is Sonys problems.  If there are 1000's of people 
shown as playing on the server, good chance its your ISP's backbone problem.  
If you can't get to the server list, you need to check out your favorite web 
site for up to date info.
