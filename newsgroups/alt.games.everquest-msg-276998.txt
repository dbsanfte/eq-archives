Oh, c'mon.  You have got to know better than that.  There is no
such thing as a "free market".

A regulated market is by definition not free.

In an unregulated market the winning competitors eliminate (or
absorb) their defeated rivals.  Once they've reached the largest
size they can successfully manage, they enter into price-fixing
cartels with one another and thereby create defacto monopolies
which stifle competition and manage the decidedly unfree market
to the overwhelming advantage of the monopolists, with as little
as possible for the interests of others.
