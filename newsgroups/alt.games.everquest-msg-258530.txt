/em realizes he hasn't checked the messageboard yet today, hmm... Don't 
see a new forum yet, must be on the VC boards. :)

Heh aye, Prism seems really good at stretching it out. :) We've spent 
about 2-3 months now negotiating how to add to the bylaws a section 
that'll make it possible to modify the bylaws.

God forbid we should actually want to make a change after that one, 
though, the planned change calls for a 2/3 vote for bylaws changes, and 
our votes are almost invariably 60/40 splits. :)
