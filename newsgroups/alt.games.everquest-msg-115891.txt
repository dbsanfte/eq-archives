No, I think just laziness and stupidity are the real reasons.

If you're doing either of those places, you're not soloing.  In fact, it's 
a good chance you're raiding.  If there isn't anyone camping the seahorses 
(and on Innoruuk they're camped the majority of the time I'm passing 
through), and you can't sow, and you are running all by yourself, then 
maybe you'll have to sit and wait 3-5 minutes for someone else to come 
running through and trail behind them.

Aye, I started raiding WW dragons at 48/49, and it was a bitch to get 
across then.  That was also before SG was tuned to make it significantly 
easier.  If I was raiding there, I had a raid force crossing that I could 
run with.  I still think it's absolutely trivial to cross SG for anyone 
who has a reason to cross it.
