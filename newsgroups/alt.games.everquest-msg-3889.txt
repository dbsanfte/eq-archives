You will find that you will only use your practice points to learn a
new skill or to start off a weapon skill form 0. As you fight all your
skills will go up. Dex will have a major factior in how fast you learn
your weapon skills. My lv 35 dwarf warrior has a dex of 129 and can
usually max out all of his weapon skills (1hs, 1hb, and 2hs) along
with everything else, defence, offence, pary, ripost, and something
else I cant remember right now, by the time he gets his third yellow
bubble for that new level. You will find that after you get duel weild
that the idea of using just one weapon and a shield will fall to the
wayside to go for the two weapons for the damage output. But dont
forget to still work on bash once in a while, Its a great skill to
have up for when your in a group fighting casting mobs. At lv 35 my
warrior has 120 trainging points stored up, to give you an idea of how
little you will use them.

Lv 35 warrior
lv 35 Druid
lv 25 cleric
lv 20 rogue
lv 20 monk
lv 55 necromancer
