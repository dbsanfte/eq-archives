This is from java developer's journal.  It's not about EQ, per se, but it
makes some interesting points.  Thought some techie types might be
interested.  It cut off the bottom of the article but there isn't much more.

If this is HTML, let me know.  I don't think it is but this stupid software
doesn't make it easy to know for sure.  And yeah, I know, free agent is much
better.

Video games are finally entrenched in popular culture and are as widespread
a form of entertainment as movies and television. What's most startling is
that the games industry achieved this entertainment parity without relying
on the standards found in the television and movie industries. This was
possible because games were played on proprietary systems designed to do one
thing: play games. But in today's world of 206MHz PDAs and 3D-capable cell
phones, games are being played everywhere, and for a content industry that
has no set standards this presents a significant problem: chasing customers
across multiple devices.

Compounding this problem is the onslaught of competition from large media
companies that already have broadcast standards in place. They place their
content on the same game-playing devices and fight for t4he same consumer's
attention. To compete effectively in this arena, game developers need to
stop thinking about individual devices as game platforms and consider these
devices game framework. Let's use a massively multiplayer RPG (MMRPG) as an
example. In an MMRPG there's a tremendous amount of time that typically goes
into playing and maintaining a character. The average EverQuest player, for
example, spends an average of 28 hours a week on the game. The problem is
that when you're maintaining your character, you're not playing the game.

By moving the less computationally intensive components (such as character
maintenance, communication, and trading functions) to a mobile device, you
achieve three things.


Keep your content in front of your customer: This keeps the game world,
characters, and brand in front of the game player. It's a world where
players spend at least one day a week in, and you're enabling them to engage
in more pieces of that world.
Allow the player to prepare characters for game play at a later time:
Players can do the tedious maintenance separately from the gaming rig,
preparing their charactemponents in Java to make it the de facto standard
for game development. Sun Microsystems, Inc., is working with several major
game developers and hardware manufacturers, including Sony, on the Java Game
Profile (JSR-134). This Java Specification Request identifies the various
areas of game development, and the participating game developers are working
together to build the components and technologies that will enable the first
true cross-platform game development technologies. Sun has also launched
www.JavaGaming.org to act as ground zero for Java game development, offering
everything from discussion boards to sample code to cool links.
As the pressures and costs of developing increasingly compelling game
content in the face of new competition continue to rise, the benefits of
Java become more attractive. With the high level of penetration across
dozens of different media devices, Java is providing an exciting,
high-performance platform for the
