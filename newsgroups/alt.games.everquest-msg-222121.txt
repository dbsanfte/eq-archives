55

I waited to 50 on my enchanter alt and he started with a 50
skill.  Then used bazaar purchased stuff to go to 101, and
LoY swatches to go to 135ish.  Then just dropped skill
points in to 200.

Those swatches are great - skillups and they sell for 9pp
to vendors.  Look for the components in the 5-10pp range and
you'll break even pp wise while skilling up.
