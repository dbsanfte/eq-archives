Well, see thats why you have an SK / Pally / Beast be your MT rather
than some warrior...   My beast cast incapcitate, then my DoT, that
mob is not going to go after anyone but me.... , I have yet to have a
mob go for anyone else, when I was intentionaly breaking the mez..

An SK and Pally have no need to taunt before breaking... they have
similar spells to grab aggro from any mez...
