OK your main role after a mob is pulled is to make sure they are slowed.
Tashed is a Magic reduction debuff that enchanters get so dont worry abot
that one on a shaman.  You can help park adds if you dont have the crowd
control, you ca help heal if its needed, or you can help with the DPS.
Shamans have a range of varities to work with.  Ofcourse the funniest thing
you can do is solo.
