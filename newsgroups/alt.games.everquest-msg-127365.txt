}I'm sorry that you can't... no, won't be pleased.  

Oh, I'm plenty pleased with it.  Really, from a random start, it's pretty 
good.  It just doesn't in the least seem 'designed' to me.

}In the end, though, you've shown how shallow your argument is.

And you've shown that you can't appreciate its depth.  Similarly, I have a 
big problem appreciating the supposed depth of this watchmaker argument 
that keeps being trotted out. 

Note, though, I was only trying to show you how someone could come to this 
conclusion.  I'm not going to attempt to -prove- that it was not designed, 
because it can't be proven, for exactly the same reasons that you can't 
-prove- the opposite.  Some things just have to be a matter of faith one 
way or the other.  There isn't even really any evidence for either side 
that doesn't amount to the equivalent value of hearsay or circumstantial.
