Will they be requiring an era to be 'finished' before opening the next,
or just the 'main' bosses killed?

Agree as 'main' mobs; to finish, one might consider Inny (which
version?) in Hate, CT in Fear. Will Hate be back to the way it was? I
don't think new Hate 2nd floor could be tackled at level 50...

If VP were still in its original state, I would have said Phara Dar
(final dragon in VP, iirc). But who knows what state it will be in?
Will the new key quest even be in? They have until Kunark is opened to
decide these things, which will probably be less time then they have
planned, knowing SOE.

I would say Trakanon as main, VP dragons as finished.

Sky is interesting also - I believe it was open before Kunark
originally, but you need level 60 to even contemplate finishing it.

> What do you kill in Velious?  Vindi?

Vindi is baby's first raid mob in Velious, wouldn't you agree? :)

> Wake the Sleeper?  Kill
> everything in NTOV?

Seeing as Velious was where raiding really took off, there is a lot to
choose from. 'Finishing' Velious I'd say would be wake the Sleeper and
finish NTOV (will Vulak`Aerr be there, and if so in what form?). They
might call it done once Tormax, Yelinak, Tunare are down.

Emp and Seru as main mobs. Finished would be Aten Ha Ra (Vex Thal). The
idea of doing shards again... bleh. I really hope they don't require
Vex Thal entry to open PoP.

> PoP: Quarm.

Yes, easy to say.

Don't know, never did them,

It is Innoruuk, but yes it's interesting as to how they will figure
this into 'progression'.
