These things you mention... can you really spend $5 to be
invulnerable? Haven't played the games myself.. but if the game
doesn't support an in-game economy, its kind of a moot point. The game
is setup for how it is setup.. and without the in-game economy with
both a monetary system and a trading method, the type of tie in you
suggest simply wouldn't be applicable.

Everquest allready has that.. you go buy an expansion why... so that
you can access better items in new zones with new mobs that weren't in
the original game that you bought.

As per IGE, I never have had the need actually.

Sure.. and why is that such a bad thing? Why should games always be a
wallet-reducing option?

>Why not just package a 65th level character in when you buy the game?

Because it would be auto-generated. The economy of a server needs to
take care of itself, not have SoE run what is basically an exploit to
make a character.

Good question.

Thinking about it, and i'm sure there are plenty of you that would not
agree with me, I'd say yes. Allow a full featured scripting engine so
long as it doesn't allow you to do things at a speed a character
wouldn't normally do it at. In other words.. you can't forage any
faster.. fish any faster.. etc. The economy will take care of itself.

True.. and I went with you on it. I'd say go full scripting, but part
of that is the programmer side of me wondering where it would all go
in this little experiment. :>

Agreed. And how they do it is as important as if they do it.

Long term profitability is the only way an mmorpg can survive though.
Its the reason EQ is still around after 5 years of play. Especially
given the fact it takes considerable amounts of capital in order to
create and support a new game. Its taken years and millions upon
millions of dollars to complete both WoW and EQ2.. and they're
seriously going to undercut the economies by flooding them with
auto-gen'd items? I find that hard to believe, it would take a
complete lack of understanding of what they've actually made.
