One of my favorite activities in EQ1 was playing my druid and using
his skills to help out people in need.  Sometimes, you just get tired
of the grind, and it can be incredibly fulfilling to help a soul in
need, perhaps *especially* fulfilling to help them when they don't
expect it!

I made many friends that way, by being both the helper and the helpee.
I can't express how dissapointed I am that EQ2 completely destroyed
that.  I just don't understand what's going on in the minds of the EQ2
designers, it seems like one bad design choice after another.
