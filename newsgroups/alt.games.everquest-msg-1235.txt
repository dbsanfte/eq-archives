I was camping Crystalline Wurms with two others last night and we got
three spell drops off of the first four Wurms.  I ended up with the
level 50 Ranger Spell, Call of Earth, and wanted to know a fair price
for it.  I've checked the normal sites, and don't see it listed.  I'm
not looking to rip anyone off, just trying to determine a fair price.
Is there something other than eqmaps.com and eqprices.com that can be
generally relied upon to have decent prices?  (Say what you will,
until I got a pair to Singing Steel Arms for 2k yesterday, EVERYTHING
of any value that I've bought or sold has been close to the price on
both eqmaps and eqprices.)
Of course if anyone is on Innoruuk and has a drop-only Bard song to
trade, I would gladly do a one-for-one trade.
