All MMORPGs have their share of bugs, but this is a pretty bad one.
Have you ever wondered why some people have so much platinum in Everquest?

Well part of the reason is a bug that's been exploited to give out 
free platinum. My guild has used it for months, but word (and the exploit)
got out and other guilds have been abusing it.

My guild member darkelf has decided to make this exploit available to all
so that the EQ developers will fix the problem.
