No one knows except Verant and they haven't said anything about them.
All the evidence has been anecdotal that I have seen. Something like this would take
tons of data and comparison and log parsing to even get close to a true
answer. I don't think anyone has had the initiative to do it yet. I know I
don't.

But just keep it cast on you while doing jewelry and hope for the best.
What the hell it can't hurt. Well er... that is unless a gremlin got in to the
code at Verant and moved a decimal point the wrong way or changed
the sign of the multiplier. Nah that couldn't happen, could it?
