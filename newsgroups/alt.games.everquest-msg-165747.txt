We still haven't killed Greig, you know.  I guess we should go do it

PoP trivialised everything more than any other expansion, imo.  Do you
disagree that PoP trivialised more than SoL did to Velious, and Velious did
to Kunark?

She wasn't totally gimped, 900flurry + knockback + big regen is a lil more
than your average orc pawn...

As for rooting mobs.. shrug I still don't know why VI got a hardon about
rooting 99% of the damn game.  It didn't improve things for the most part...

Maybe so.. but AoW was always the kind of mob you figured would never be
trivial, couldn't be gimped.. and well, now he can..
