Actually, it's a paradoxial mess no matter what. I'm sure everyone's
heard this one before:

Question:
Since omnipotence by definition declares that someone who is
omnipotent is all-powerful, ie there is nothing that one can't do, can
god create a mountain (or whatever object you'd like) that is so big,
that even he can't move it.

If the answer is yes, than god is not omnipotent by definition,
because we just found something he can't do (namely move the large
object).
If the answer is no, than god is not omnipotent by definition, because
we just found something he can't do (namely create said object).

Either way, omnipotence is therefore impossible.

Btw, the Simpsons did a great spin on this: Homer asked Flanders "Can
god make a burrito so hot, that even he can't eat it?" or something
like it. =)
