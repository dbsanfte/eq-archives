Aug gives a variety of benefits including haste and AC and lasts about a
half hour.  Alacrity gives more haste but nothing else, and lasts...what, 15
minutes?

At level 29 unless there was a damned good reason to give someone Alacrity
they got Aug and liked it.  At level 29 I didn't know about the AC factor or
else I would have been casting it on the primary healer and myself as well.
I do now, though, and when AC is important (at level 55) I still cast it on
myself.

Alacrity just isn't that much better in most situations.  If I recall
correctly it's also MUCH more mana expensive, compared to Aug.  Mana that
can be much better utilized SLOWING critters if you don't have a shaman and
the fight is expected to last for a minute.
