I see lots of people on the Islamic side talking the talk, but I don't
recall seeing any walking the walk.

Arafat (as a prime example) has been denouncing terrorist actions for
quite a while.  And he denounces them again and again, each time they
happen.  We hear a lot about the Israelis shooting or arresting
members of various terrorist groups, but I can't recall the last time
I heard of the Palestinians doing so (with the noted exception of the
ones who took refuge in Arafat's own offices).
