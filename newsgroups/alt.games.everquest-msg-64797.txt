I got one that said Doing something you really don't want to know

Also the voodoo cards that allegedly will work?  Yeah right, everything
has a black box around it, player/npc names, the ping bar had a purple
box, each word in the text box.  click on an item in your or a merchants
inventory, and it goes totally black so you can't see it.  Rumored to be
an incompatibility with the video driver and direct x 8.1  hoping i can
get rid of that somehow.  If not, my playing days may be through, as I
cannot afford to upgrade my computer any time soon.  Hours cut to 15 at
work right now, and would be less but union states they have to give us
a minimum of 15.
