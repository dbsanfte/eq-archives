With a full group, you can get level appropriate spells.  Some of the 
spells drop only off certain mobs that may require a raid force, but most 
are obtainable with a single group, or less.  The research items seem to 
drop randomly off of level appropriate mobs.  Mobs that are easily doable 
in a group of the appropriate level.  

The problem is the randomness of the spell and component drops, you are 
just as likely to get a spell that you already have, or that is for a 
different class as you are to get the spell you are looking for.
