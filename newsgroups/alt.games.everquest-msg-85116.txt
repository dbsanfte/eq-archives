Its just a troll posted to many newsgroups in order to make a big long
thread and possibly spread racist hate.

Really it accomplishes nothing except make a big long troll thread. It
doesn't even mess up usenet service like it used to since most people
are now on flat rate pay ISPS or broadband so DL'ing all of those
posts does not even hurt them (unless euros paying phone toll)

They are spread by the same racists who post the things about black or
hispanic or jewish people doing some other stuff. They post anything
from the news which details a minority doing anything wrong. It is all
part of their hate agenda.
