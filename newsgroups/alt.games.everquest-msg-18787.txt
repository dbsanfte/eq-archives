Have some patience on a Sunday willya?

Generally good, but what stood out in my eyes was that you spend too
much time explaining what everything is, like most of the intro and
the paranthesis about druids being treehugger masters of nature. I
think it'd be better if you didn't explain every detail this way; you
should assume the reader has *some* knowledge or basic ability to
comprehend what a mage or wizard is without so many words. And stuff
like explaining why druids would play tricks, try to incorporate it
more into the story. (Example: 'maybe it was a druid, playing yet
another trick on someone for calling them treehuggers')
