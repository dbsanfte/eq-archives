It sounds like SOE is going to rollback just about everyone who tried
the npc and others who may have bought or recieved the ill gotten gain
from the players.  Worse, if you paid, you never get the plats back
even if it was to other players.

I spent my time just sitting in bazaar selling junk so I never got
affected by SOE's blunder.

I did get a good chuckle or 2 out of people /oocing in PoK how to get
reimbursed for the lost items.  money I can understand but don't
expect to get back 20 stacks of metallic drake wings.
