They do, however, lose all their pet buffs, including the one that makes
the summoned pet something close to their own level.  So, essentially,
not having the pet be unsummoned entirely is a fiction continuity thing
(your warder is, in theory, your permanent buddy[*]) and not so much of a 
gameplay convenience.

himself stuck on the weirdest terrain features so that you were
constantly having to unsummon and resummon him in anything but a plains
zone.
