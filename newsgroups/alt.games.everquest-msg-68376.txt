All I can say is that I am *VERY* glad my shadow knight didn't dawdle
around inside the NK wizard spires as it fired last night :)
(I was waiting for a friend to login and take my picture as it counted
down the last three minutes. I didn't know about the porting bug, but
decided to maintain minimum safe distance and see what happened.
The effects of the portal opening were so stunning it took me a few
seconds to notice a griffawn had taken interest in me :) so I had to
run to SK with a griffawn and then two unhappy guards on my tail.
Meanwhile, my friend crashed while trying to login, so I'll have to
see about getting that picture taken some other night.)
