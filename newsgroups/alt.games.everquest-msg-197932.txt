Eh?

Dang, I thought she was human, because her ear is very small.  But for all
that it is small, it does appear slightly pointed.  Or maybe it's the
angle and the way the hair drops.  She couldn't be a...a...half-elf, could
she?  (*shaken at the idea of a half-elf having long hair and wearing a
robe*)

I was all excited because I thought she was evidence that you dont' have
to be a wood elf to be sexy in a petite way.
