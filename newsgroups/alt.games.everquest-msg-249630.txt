Who should care, it is going on in a massive scale already... Heck groups
and companies are farming now as it is. Look at it this way when you leave
and sooner or later we all do, this will provide some sweat equity.. by
getting some of the cash back without fear of getting ripped off. If you
don't choose to use then don't. Everyone has a great distaste for some of
the companies that do it, but why not level the playing field for everyone?

so CIHYS might change to CIBYS...
