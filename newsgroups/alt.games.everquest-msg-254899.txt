Vent On:
This is one of my pet peeves.  If you aren't going to be able to actually
*join* the group for 20 minutes please say so.   If I am LFG and I accept an
invitation I run my butt right over there.  Always.   I make sure I have food,
water and dots before I ever turn LFG on.  
I will never understand the people LFG who show up 20 minutes later and then
forgot they were out of arrows or rations or some such stupid thing.  We had
one necro show up without bone chips and another guy who was missing the *mage
pet reagent thing*.  We actually had a tank show up one day who forgot his
weapons.  How do you forget your weapons??? Someone please explain this to me.
And, FWIW, if I *know* it's going to take us 15 minutes to get buffed and
organized I always say that in my invite:  "We are starting a LDON in about 15
minutes.  Interested?"
I've heard excuses ranging from "I had to run to 3 different zones to get my
new spells, I had to go to the store and get smokes real quick, I was taking a
shower, I was eating dinner, my mom made me finish mowing the lawn".  Hello? 
Why did you agree to join the group then ya moron?
The lawn mowing idjit informed me that I made his "ignore" list because we
replaced him after repeated /tells got no response.  I THANKED HIM PROFUSELY
for doing me that favor.  Don't know if he saw it or not though.  I sure hope
he did.
*THESE* are probably the same people who sit around complaining that they can't
get a group.  
OK, rant off.
