Mainly because Pack Spirit sucks... individual SoW is better (see post
elsewhere in thread)
Just remind your Druid to spread the SoW (most should be happy, if not...
don't buff them)

A good grouping Druid should be using his Group Skin... (unless there's a
cleric in the group overwriting with their better hp buffs) and Group Regen
(not much, but takes a little strain off the cleric). Group wolfform is
sometimes handy above ground, but usually SoW-ing is worth more than the
small ATK bonus.

Because they're idiots who spent 40 levels soloing and being PL'd... and now
don't know how to play in a group?
Root in a group is BAD... group mages need to learn about their OTHER pets
abilities :o)

Dunno... there's a lot of anti-pet propaganda out there... usually the
result of people grouping with Mages/Necros that don't know how to use pets
in a dungeon. Maybe the Shamen are wary of getting tarred with the same
brush?

I'm not sure I understand this question... does AFK not show to people if
they enter the zone after you set it?
