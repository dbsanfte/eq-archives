It isn't working yet, but Transgaming is well on thier way to getting
DirectX 8 working, and I'm assuming 8.1 to follow.

From the Transgaming Website:

"Ottawa/Toronto, Canada. Breakthrough developments on TransGaming's
incredible WineX portability technology have for the first time enabled a
DirectX� 8-based game title, Max Payne, to operate on the Linux platform.

TransGaming's engineering team has been hard at work upgrading TransGaming's
WineX software to be compatible with games written for Microsoft's� latest
version of the DirectX� API.

Max Payne is the first major DirectX� 8-based game that the updated WineX
software is able to run. Developed by Remedy Enterprises and released last
year, Max Payne is a third person action thriller featuring a gripping
storyline, impressive graphics, bullet-time action and dynamic sound made
for the XBoxTM, PS 2 and PC markets."

EQ is on thier top ten list of requested games.

As to whether it's worth it or not; if you're looking for a raft of
perfectly working games, no. It's still an unfinished product. It's good
enough for some things though. I played Half-life and the recent add-on Blue
Shift all the way through. I have Diablo II up and running, and a few other
things.

If you're interested in following, and having some input on, an interesting
project that might someday allow you to get Windows off your system
completely, then yes, it's worth it.
