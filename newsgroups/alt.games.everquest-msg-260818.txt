This sounds, pardon my Fier Dal, like a load of crap, considering in the 
recently posted Q&A every time anyone asked what OOW brings for the 
majority of players, who are in the 30-50 range, they brought  up tasks 
like it was going to be a big thing.

If tasks mean as little as slightly more directed activities for 
practically not reward at all, then I'd just as soon not bother; I can 
think of things to do for myself, and I suspect I'd end up with better 
than 100pp for 3 hours work... even if I was level 5, much less in my 
60s.  Heck, I can get better than that killing about 5 mobs in POJ Jail!

But as you say, thats not necessarily the case, so I'll have to hold off 
on making that kind of judgement call till we get some reports in from 
the fools, er, sacrificial goats, er, brave forward thinking people who 
bought OOW.

Assuming the patch ever ends so we can get in and play  for 15 minutes 
before they have to repatch.
