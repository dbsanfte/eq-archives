Whoops. Sorry. That's what happens when I try and post on four hours of sleep.

You misunderstand what I am arguing here (probably because I wasn't clear
enough; see lack of sleep note above). I'm not arguing the gun control issue, or
the reduction in crime issue, or any of the rest of it. The only thing I am
arguing is the validity of a comparison between the violent crime rates in
Virginia and DC being based largely in the difference between their gun laws.
And I'm not trying to "win" any argument. I just like an intelligent debate.

As for presenting other factors, I will try and do that soon, if people would
like, but I simply do not have time to gather more detailed information than
what I have already mentioned, such as general population density and
urban/suburban settings. Today is too overbooked already.  :)
