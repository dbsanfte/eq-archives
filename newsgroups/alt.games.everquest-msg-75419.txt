Systems were and still are;

AMD 1200
512mb
Geforce3

PIII 600 (@800)
512mb
KyroII 64mb

The second system struggles with some graphics, especially on luclin.
Framerate in Bazaar is appalling.
I run both at 1024x768

I'm not experiencing anymore lag than I ever had before but then, the
network code was not changed (that I was aware of) and I am still on the
single, 64k ISDN channel I was before SoL.

CF
Might Upgrade again soon, although prolly only CPU and Mobo...not sure if
I'll spend more on another VGA card as there isn't anything out there that
is worth buying.
