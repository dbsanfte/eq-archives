Ok, I've hunted Xorbb off and on for about 4 levels, never seen anything
stronger than the eyes or xorbb himself, was on the way to EK, killed a
couple gobbies in the new Runnyeye, got a horde of sporelings on me, ran to
zone, started bandageing, here comes some level 30-something guy with a dorf
in tow (Diggs Duggun), I figure he won't attack me with my high faction with
all the kaladim dorfs, he chews through a level 11 (now 10) SK and the SK's
pet in about half a hit, then all of the sudden "Loading... Please wait.".

Scrolling back, he hit me for 428 damage, WTF is this guy doing in
existence, especially something of such an enormously high level, in a
relatively low level zone like Xorbb?

And yes, I do know he's for the Paladin Divine Might spell, but WTF is he
doing killing everybody so fast?

Of course, the level 30-ish SK who trained him on me got a nice place at the
top of my NO FOOD list (and no rez if my cleric ever makes it past level 8,
doubtful though), bleh, i know that you lose more exp at higher levels, but
IMHO, the SK shouldve just taken his beating like a man rather than getting
2 lower levels killed without a chance, this guy did kill us in one hit
after all, even though i was sitting on the zone line, i had NO chance, and
the SK didn't even shout to watch out, he just let us die.

(sorry if this is a bit unreadable but I'm a tad bit angry, I came within a
sliver of a blue bubble of losing my level too)

Other than this dorf bastard, Xorbb is a GREAT zone.
