Guild Wars Factions is a computer game released in 2006 by ArenaNet
and is the first stand-alone campaign expanding on Prophecies, the
original Guild Wars
game. Factions introduces the player to the continent of Cantha where
two warring factions, Luxon and Kurzick, battle for domination.
Players are able to join in this conflict, assisting their chosen
faction in claiming towns on the game map.
Factions has a new PvE campaign, two new professions, new skills and
armor for existing professions, new gameplay modes for both PvE and
PvP and also
addresses some of the criticisms of the original game.
