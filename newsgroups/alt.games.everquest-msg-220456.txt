If the spheres are that common (and a couple of people have mentioned
that they are) swifty would definitely be worth doing.

One of those things I just don't have the patience for.

I do have a swarmcaller but find it useless. Stuff dies too quickly in
groups to bother and if I'm soloing I can kill stuff twice as fast
with a good 2 hander than with a swarmcaller so even if it procced
immediately it wouldn't save me anything. 

... is there something here that I'm missing?

Heh, I doubt my shaman would give that one up if I got it. I did take
a group deep into PoM last week, was everyone's first trip but the
zone seemed kinda useless. No loot, total cash was around 200p and exp
sucked. Maybe we just had an off day but I'm not all that eager to
head back. Trying to think though, isn't there a decent melee mask
with regen that drops in inner AC? 

Thanks for your input, 

Frank
