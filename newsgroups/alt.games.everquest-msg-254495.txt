    VERY asleep at the wheel. There's a list of robes that can be turned
into tunics in the patch message today. Odd thing is, with maybe one
exception, the items listed are pieces of crap that people get only because
they have robe graphics. Perhaps this is being done so casters can get a
tunic graphic, but honestly, there's OK items in game that already do that.
I can just see the text on the quest NPC:

You say, 'Hail, Malcohm Thimbleton.'
Malcohm Thimbleton says, 'Greetings, traveller! I am Malcohm, nerfmaster
supreme! Would you like me to get rid of the [one useful quality] of some of
your items?'
