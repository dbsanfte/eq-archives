There is no exact formula to determine the amount of damage you will take
mainly because mob's offensive capabilities do not follow the same rules as
a PC does. Also there is no way of knowing what a mobs strength is and their
skills. I have come up with a minor observation that about every 20-30 AC
reduces damage by 1 point for a mob that is an equal level. Your total AC is
determined by your Armor's AC, Level, Defense, Dodge, Reposit, and Block
skills. Your Atk determines the amount of damage you do and it consists of
Weapon, Weapons Skill level (1hs or 1hb ect), any Weapon modifier, Str,
Bash, Slam, Dual Attack, Double Attack, Reposit, skills. Dex and Agi
determine how fast you learn offensive and defensive skills, also Dex helps
your weapon produce an effect more often, while Agi will help you from being
hit.
