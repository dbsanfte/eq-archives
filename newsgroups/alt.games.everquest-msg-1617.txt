As someone who really appreciates the fun you were having let me first
congratulate you.  Not so much on accomplishing the cross country trip,
but on having fun doing something silly!!

Secondly I'd like to suggest some further fun you or others may want to
try in this same vein.  The very same trip you just made is MUCH more
exciting on the Test server due to the low player population.  I've
never made it through Highhold with a lvl one on Test, despite several
attempts, but I do prefer the challenge of going that way over taking
the Gorge, even if the Runnyeye part can prove interesting.  Another fun
one to try is the lvl one Iksar to Qeynos.  Being KOS at both Kunark
ports makes for interesting travel... if you get that far.  Keep on
having fun!!!
