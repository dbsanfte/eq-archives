Thanks for all of the suggestions. I'll start jumping back into melee
more and turn the mob so that my pet attacks its back. When I gain a
few levels, it seems that my mana situation will be easier. I'll also
keep all of the spell suggestions in mind as I get them.

Now, I'm off to learn to meditate so it doesn't take so long to regain
mana.

Don't want to burst your bubble but it's only gonna get worse and it's gonna
get much worse.  The necro is probably the most mana efficient spellcaster in
the game but if you choose to solo,  you are going to be sitting around doing
nothing for long periods of time.  That's the way the game is designed.  Some
of the people that respond here regularly will have you believe that there is
some skill, talent, or magic that you just dont possess if you don't like the
downtime, but it's not true.  You're right, it's unavoidable and it's boring. 
My reccomendation is to go to nexus or PoP and get a spell called KEI cast on
you.  It speeds up your mana regeneration to an almost bearable rate.  Good
Luck.
