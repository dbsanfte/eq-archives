I would guess that the answer is almost certainly no, however, it is still
not possible to state unequivocally at what specific age the change should
occur, it has to be taken on a case by case basis.  Different people mature
at widely different rates.  I believe that this is bizbee's point, which you
seem to be unwilling to accept as an answer.  I know I can't give you a
specific age at which I would say that is it.  I can say that I would find
it hard to imagine a case of a 6 or 9 year old where I would support trying
him/her as an adult.  12 would be difficult, 14, I can start to imagine that
the treatment should be different, as to trying as an adult, I'm not sure
that's the answer.  I don't have all the answers.
