I have a similar problem on my server. There is a guild called Pretorians.
No big deal, but their "sister" guild is called "Pretorians Elite". As to
this day I have not found a way to list PE's members with /who. I've tried
it a couple of times because alot of ex-guildies of mine are in there and I
sometimes can tag along with their raids.
