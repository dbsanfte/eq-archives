 I'm pretty sure upper-level Bards can outrun Wuoshi. Maybe see if one
of them can help. Does he see invis though? I haven't been around him
lately but I thought he didn't but I could be wrong though. Personally
Wusohi is the main reason I don't normally take Wakening Land ports
unless I'm sure he's dead. I'd rather take a port to CS and run back
through Skyshrine or one to Great Divide and go the other way.

 I do think Verant made the WL portal a little too 'dangerous' but ah
well. He's only up about 5% of the time these days anyway.
