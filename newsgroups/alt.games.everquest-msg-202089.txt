Well, speaking as a former chevette owner, the vibrations in the
body/suspension when I got mine up to 75 mph convinced me going any faster
was not the brightest of ideas...

We had thought of nitrous, but figured that the ol' Iron Duke (the 4-banger
used in the chevette) would either explode or just rip the undercarriage out
of the vehicle.

Now, mind you, *that* would be a cool car - a riceboy chevette.  Big, pagoda
wing, lowered body, low profile tires on goofy rims and the fat pipe
exhaust.  Even a "Type R" sticker or two.  Yeah, that auto would command
respect and be a real chick magnet...
