Progressive betting does not work.  Your bet will increase
exponentially but your initial payout remains constant.  So, if your
initial bet is 10pp and you keep doubling, it can easily turn into
having to bet hundreds of pp riding to win the original 10pp.  If you
hit a cap or the casino logs, you're SOL.
