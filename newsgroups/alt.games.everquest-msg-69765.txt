No, nothing in SoL's graphics is worth the upgrade.
What IS worth the upgrade is the additional content.  Content is what
makes or breaks this game.  If SoL only added new content and skipped
the updated graphics engine, I think 90% of the problems folks are
having right now would just disappear.  What remains would be minor
tuning issues like mob capabilities, drop tables, resist tables and
fixing busted quests/items.

SoL should have been strictly an extra content expansion.  The new
graphics engine should have been rolled in progressively--much the way
they did with the DX8 library pre-SoL (where folks who wanted to play
with the new graphics could choose to do so with the updated library).

That would have given them more time to get the content and tuning
right.  The fact that the boss mobs in at least two zones are marked
as "vendors" tells me they didn't have time to work on the content in
these higher end zones properly (hihi, I'm the Boss of Akheva, would
you like to buy a Flask of Water today?) and took the shortcut of
"Hey, don't kill this yet we ain't done".
