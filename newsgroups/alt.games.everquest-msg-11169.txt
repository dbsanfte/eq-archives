At what levels?  My 18 druid finds root/dot to be slower than
SoT/Thistlecoat/Firefist, hit the mob with Stinging Swarm and Flame
Lick, and then melee with my Coldain Velium Warhammer, which procs a 12
point DD a couple of times during the fight, even taking into account
med time after the fight.  I don't even Snare the mob, unless I need to
pull it a fair distance (e.g., far enough that SoT would use a
significant portion of its time before melee starts), so that I have
time to SoT and SS while the mob is running.  (Normally, I SoT myself,
then get the mobs attention with SS).

I'm guessing root/dot doesn't become effective until I get a better root
than Grasping Roots?
