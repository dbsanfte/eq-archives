Lance,
I am a little surprised at you .. the best races on PvP servers are
invariably the best solo classes which can put out DPS .. ie wizards and to
a lesser extent mages. Sustained quick damage is the way to go and this is
why you are seeing these casting classes rather than any mellee or hybrid
class.
regards
