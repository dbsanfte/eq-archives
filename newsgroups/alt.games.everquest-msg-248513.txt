Unless of course your agro gets fuxored. It wasn't too long ago that I
was on a raid where two of the golems got tied up together and both
agro'd on the raid somehow except nobody knew where they were. Its
always fun getting DT'd out of the middle of nowhere while you are
hastily trying to track them down. Btw... 1 minute sounds over.. i
think it was more like 40 seconds on the DT if i recall.
