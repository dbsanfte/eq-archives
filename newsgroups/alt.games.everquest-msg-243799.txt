http://www.lo-gear.com/gallery/sigs.html is what i'd recommend at this
point...just trying to be helpful

only downside is that he requires in-game pp as payment, and fennin ro
only...

you could probably find someone, a bazaar whore, to trade 10k/25k here for
the same amount on your server

then looking at what you have here, i dont know if thisseus will be able to
help you out

really, i haven't seen but 5 or 6 eq sigs that really did it for me, so i'm
not the best person to ask, but everyone with a thisseus sig seems to be
very happy with it

hope it helps? heh
