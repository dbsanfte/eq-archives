Whoever wrote that article is so full of crap...he keeps making it sound
like FoH is oppressed by Verant and there is some epic struggle between
them.  Why the fuck do they bother playing if they think Verant is out to
piss them off?  How would they like it if Verant didn't design ANY high
level content, then they wouldn't have to deal with "ridiculous slaps in the
face."  "The "MAN" trying to hold us down... in the end, we win... as
always." That is the stupidest single sentence beginning with a capital
letter and ending with a period I have read in a while.  No shit they won,
it was DESIGNED THAT WAY!  If Verant didn't want them to win, they wouldn't.
IT'S A GAME! Games are supposed to have challenges.  If they don't want
challenges, they should STOP PLAYING EQ!  It's as simple as that, but
somehow he doesn't seem to understand.
