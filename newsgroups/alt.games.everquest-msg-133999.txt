Smooth move - propoganda in attempts to talk a gun holder into laying
his gun down. the reality is, you may actually talk *some* gun holders
into laying their weapons down, and quite frankly, the people falling 
for this should'nt even be holding guns.  The others just like the feel
of their guns far too much to lay them down. Far more of these kind.

 
   - It all boils down to 2 groups of people, the "haves", and
   - thoes truely obsessed with the "haves". The obsessed are
   - terrorist supporters, anti-American, anti-Bush, anti-big
   - business, and generally anti-Western establishment. They
   - can be easily identifed by which side of the "Bill Gates test"
   - they are on. If they answer "Yes" to the question of 'Does
   - Bill Gates have too much money', then they are of that nature.
