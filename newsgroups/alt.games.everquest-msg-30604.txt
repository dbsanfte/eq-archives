My druids not even my main, I frequently buy stuff for my
main a 41 rogue with my druid, cause my druid seems to make
money easier.  Maybe it was cause i did most of 20 to 29
soloing Mammoths, heheh.  Fear kiting Mammoths is awsome
experience and loot.  I bought my rogue his slimey, just got
a good deal on a crystal grinder which is what dropped me to
120.  As you say it's much easier to buy a 200pp item for an
alt, then it is a 2k-10k item for your main.  Esp when that
200pp item is something that when your main originally
wanted it was a 2k item hehehe.
