Nope.  I said that Druids can be leveled by idiots.  My Druid is a
rarely played alt.  I've been playing this game for over three years,
and over half the idiots I've encountered have been Druids, many of
them have made it to 50 and beyond.  Further, as I stated in response
to John's post, I have not met a single Necro or Mage (classes held
up as "easier" to level than Druid) above level 10 who is anywhere
near is stupid as the stupidest of the Druids I have met.  I never
claimed that Druid was fastest to level, only easiest.  And it's
easiest to level because it doesn't take much more than the ability
to breath without drooling all over your keyboard to survive and kill
xp mobs.

My Druid will never see 60.  Which has nothing to do with anything.
If you believe Druids are hard to level, which is what you claimed,
then you are an idiot.

Ah, so you are a moron.  You've played three classes, three of the
four easiest to solo, and based on that you're gonna assert that
Druids are hard to level?

rofl.  Sure, go ahead, toss out a gratuitous insult at the folks here
who play the high level game.  I'm sure that'll impress them with your
wit and intelligence.
