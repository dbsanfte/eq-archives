Well, as a 30 Druid myself....here's what I carry.  I'm a Half-Elf, and
being my first char, I didn't know how important Wis was at the
beginnning...anywho, here's what I'm wearing, and most of it can be picked
up at our level, or bought fairly cheap.

L/R Ear - Jasper Electrum Earring - Crafted Myself (+2 Wis each)
Face - Platinum Ruby Veil - Crafted by Guildie (+7 Wis/Str)
Head - Savant's Cap - Picked up in Unrest (Int +3, Wis +3)
L/R Finger - Platinum Electrum Rings - Crafted by Guildie  (+6 Wis each)
L/R Wrist - Polished Bone Bracelets - Dropped by Evil Eyes (Beholder's Maze)
(Wis +3, Int +3)
Chest - Brown Chitin Protector - Gift for a port (Sta +9, Agi +9, Dex +9)
Back - Studded Leather Cloak - Crafted by Guildie early on, but haven't
replaced yet
Legs - Gatorscale Leggins - Dropped by Acient Crocodile in Guk...Group for
it, hard to solo at 30 (Wis +4, HP +15)
Waist - Crystaline Belt - Bought in EC (+3 Wis)
Arms - Gnome Skin Sleeves - Bought in Kelethin (STR+3  SV POISON+5 )
Hands - Split Paw Gloves - Dropped in Paw (Dex +3, Wis +2)
Feet - Dwarven Word Boots - Gift from a Group in Oasis once...(STR+3
DEX+5  )
Primary - Journeymans Walking Stick - Bought in EC (Str: +4 ,Wis: +4 ,Int:
+4)
Secondary - ToV - Quested (Wis +10, Mana +10)
Range - Dustcryer's Crystal Ball - Gift for Port (+2 Int, +30 Mana)

Seems to be working for me for the time being.
