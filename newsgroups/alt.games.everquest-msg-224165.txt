Well other than most of the folk.... Its pretty much no nonsense here
(compared to other forums). Its SOOO nice not having post counts that
people treat like XP and post trash so they can "ding" as it were. The
attitude that some people get because of some post count next to their
name and some silly title assigned to their "achievement". And no
annoying gigantic graphic Sigs. Its actually more interesting to see
what people can do with ASCII sigs.

Im also impressed with the volume of traffic that AGE gets. Unless its
worthless spam - pretty much post gets answered in some way. Sure - we
get flames-trolls and other internet afflictions (ie trash like ETP -
i dont want to spell it out in fear of invoking the spirit of that
spammer ass), but the response is mostly intelligent and informative.

Im not sure what point I had to make - but.. ..well... there it is.
