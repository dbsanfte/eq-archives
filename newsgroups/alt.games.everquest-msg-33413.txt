Indeed, it seems that the majority of silly names have been on bards, my own
bards included. I have had (and recycled, because I just don't much like
bards, considered surnames in parens):

Basso (Profundo or Nova)
Libretto (Operetta)
Cantata

I have also seen bards with the names of

Songsun Blues
Barrymanilow
