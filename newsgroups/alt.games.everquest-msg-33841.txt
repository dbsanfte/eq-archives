Oftentimes clerics burnout at higher levels as their tasks, though
definitely critical to a group's success, aren't very dynamic.  heal, sit,
heal, sit, buff, sit, go insane, sit.  I love clerics but it takes a
patience I certainly don't possess.

This is my main class.  For all intents and purposes, yes, you are
completely tied to groups, and you'll live and die according to their level
of expertise.  This is the biggest reason that lower levels are so
frustrating, you end up grouped with people who just don't know how to
properly work with an enchanter, and guess who dies first :)....  It's a
class for quick thinking spell switching fast typing arrogant bossy types.
Depending on how well your group works with you, you can be the most
powerful of all classes BY FAR in terms of affecting the outcome of a fight
that's gone terribly wrong, or you can be rendered completely ineffectual.
You can in fact solo effectively however, if the situation is right.  By
right I mean a kiting area.  enough room to move, very few aggressive
wanderers.  It's done by charming one mob and siccing it on another, which
you keep rooted.  the trick is to ensure your charmed pet JUST BARELY wins
the fight, after which you easily finish it off.  If you are good at doing
this, it is very fast experience with minimal downtime.  If you make ANY
mistakes charm soloing though, you are probably about to die.  Anyways,
babble babble.  Enchanters are equal in group importance to a cleric,
require a large amount of creativity and adaptability, and ....  they die
way more often than any other class.  not for those of delicate temperament!

Paladins make great hunting partners for any casting class, utilizing roots,
stuns, blinds, etc to protect the caster from the mob.  People oftentimes go
all or nothing, overlooking the good experience and capability for smooth
coordination you can find in a 2 person group.

It's a hard call whether rogues or monks have a higher damage output at high
levels, but they are right in the same ballpark, exceeding every other class
in most situations.  Rogues have evade, which is a method of lowering a mobs
aggro against them in groups, which makes up in a big way for their
essential vulnerability in terms of AC and HP.  Some places are impossible
to get to without a rogue (such as the crypt in OS, behind a locked door).
And, lastly and possibly the most important thing - Rogues are the masters
at corpse retrievals, and as such are much needed in dungeon zones and for
cleanup and rez time on a botched raid.

Everyone loves shadowknights, they're some of the best taunters in the game
with their disease dots, high damage output, taps, and taunts.  They also
make good pullers since they can often survive long enough to get a fd off
if necessary.  This is the only real tank that can invis, and that's a
biiiig benefit.  NPC faction can make life a bit difficult for ya though.

And ports, mustn't forget ports!  Ahhh, that must be nice...
