>I have google searched for this because I know it's been covered but I can't
>find it.  There was a hotkey setup something like this:
>/g Casting complete heal on %t - 10 seconds
>/cast 2
>/pause 10
>/cast 2
>
>What I can't remember is the length of the pause... in case the 1st one
>fizzles...
>Help please!

The pauses depend in part on lag. If you get a lot of lag, try a
longer pause. On the other hand if you make the pauses too long then
if you do get a few fizzles, you might not want to be stuck casting a
CHeal, it might be better to drop a fast heal on them by that time.

Might try something like this:

/g Casting CHeal on %T, ETA 10 seconds.
/cast #
/cast #
/cast #
/cast #

This one isn't specifically so that you might fizzle 4 times, but
rather that if the spell does fizzle, you will begin casting the
follow up, within 1/2 second of the fizzle maximum. (Each line has a
built in pause of 1/2 second) Whereas in your example the follow up
spell might cast as much as 1 1/2 seconds later. On occasion 1 second
can mean the difference between a success or a wipe.

Alternately you can build in some pauses if you want to make the macro
last longer than 2 1/2 seconds. In a close situation, I'd use my
example, but on my shaman at least, I have a macro labeled "Lazy Heal"
where the macro will cast a spell and a few follow ups to cover most
conceivable fizzle situation, then sit me back down. =) I use it in
well controlled situations where I'm being lazy.

/g The Spirits of Healing, heed my call to aid %T!
/pause 10, /cast #
/pause 20, /cast #
/cast #
/sit

Very lazy.
