I wasnt knocking bards, but come on lets be realistic here.

There is a huge difference between bard and enchanter mezzing, as already
stated in another reply.

Sure you can mez mobs in Sebilis, and I would take a bard as crowd control..
a few other 'cons' though... (maybe this is just the average bard, and your
a great bard.. these are just my observations though)
When your keeping mobs mezzed, you stop playing haste song.. thus slowing
the whole groups killing rate.  Also out goes goes the stat buffs, mana song
too in my experiences.  Meanwhile a chanter can mez, whilst your all still
hasted, and all the casters still have c2.

I can't remember Juggs levels (they have never conned higher then blue to me
though) but how would you mezz these?  Or mobs that a chanter needs to use
glamour of k on (some stuff in king camp thats being a bugger to mez)

I reember one time, i had a bard and chanter in my chef group.  We had a lil
'incident', and the chanter got killed, followed by the cleric, warrior, and
ranger... the bard got them mezzed while the 2 of us held tight, awaiting
the gang group to come save us :)

Oh yeah.. chanters tash and slow are 2 other things.

if your a jack of all trades, don't expect to be a master of any
