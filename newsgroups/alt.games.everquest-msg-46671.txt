    Well, as I said originally, we'll be able to speak with each 
in RL.  And easy doesn't always mean fun.  If it did, we'd all be
playing pong right now.  The inherent challenges presented in the
new server are what is intriguing to us about it.  Granted, after
playing it for a while, even maybe even a short while, we might
decide that we are not up the the challenge.  But I'll be damned 
it it doesn't seem fun to the both of us to give it a try.
    I'm set on playing a wizard.  So the only class to figure out
is his.  Right now we are leaning towards Dark Elf Wizard/Ogre Shaman.
Ogre or Troll Shadowknight is running a very close second.  One of
the reasons this looks good to us is that we think that port/sow
capable evils might be in short supply, and thus in high demand.
And it sounds like it might be fun.
