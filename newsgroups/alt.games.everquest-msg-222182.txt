I agree with you in general, but lets play devils advocate for a
moment:

Well, if a mob lives 30 seconds with everyone killing it at once,
but 90 seconds because there are three in camp and all are being
damaged equally, then DOTs that last more than 30 seconds become
more mana efficient, and DOTs are for some classes the most mana
efficient way to do damage assuming the mobs don't die too soon. 
This is similar to the point you are making, but I think a bit
different... its not that you can cast a DOT 3 times, so much as
that the DOTS you do cast

AND DS is working on three  mobs at once instead of just one; a
DS that does 500 points per minute is only going to do 750 points
with the one mob at a time plan, but 1500 points on three mobs
all at once. 

That doesn't seem right.  Three thirty second time intervals on
one mob at a time:
250
250
250

Three thirty second time intervals on three mobs at once
250+250+250
250+250+250
250+250+250

Sorry, my mistake,thats 750 per mob, instead of 250 per mob,
because they live longer.  Three in camp means they take a total
of 2250 damage over the 90 seconds... three times the damage
output from that DS 

Certain spells are more effective in terms of mana per damage
done in an AE situation than any spell you may have for direct
damage; this is why druids and wizards quad; having multiple mobs
in camp (not mezzed) can mean that you can take advantage of
this.  Four mobs would be better, of course, I think I once
calculated that this is twice as much damage per mana spent as
casting single target nukes.

Also, if your HP is coming mostly from regen or group heals
rather than from direct heals, then having 3 people getting hurt
means you are getting 3 times as many HP back per minute.  This
strategy would mean using a group DS instead of single target to
get the DS advantage above... but almost certainly a group using
this plan has a bard in it, which means at least his part of the
DS is already group based.  In addition to his regen output, a
bard can sing Rune type songs to absorb some of the incoming
damage as well, spreading this effect out over several players
multiplies its effectiveness in the same way that spreading regen
out does.

Bard also has an AE slow that would be three times as effective
on three active mobs as on one, AE DOTs, same, Cleric may have PB
AE nuke boots as well as AE group heal legs... 

The main negative to three mobs in camp at once is that it
triples mob damage output and so requires three times the
healing.  If you can compensate for that, though, or if you are
using regen/group heal tactics instead, then its possible that
the benefits may outweigh the costs.
