No, you are still in need of some help seeing the light is all.  No 
worries about your status as a stupid fuck.

You do actually realize I totally ignored your original drunken ranting 
as just another unoriginal drunken rant.  I was posting regarding  your 
inability to see the simple logic of the other poster when he suggested 
that you quit.  Now this I don't expect you to realize, but it is key: 
the text you removed was written with a clear  purpose, that is the 
reason it was so unclearly written.  Since the simple sane statement of 
"quit" didn't seem to register with your addled mind I thought I could 
provide some insight, one insane person to another.  Unfortunately 
between the time you posted and I replied the chemical balance  of your 
mind had shifted, for better or worse I do not know, and my message was 
lost to  you.  A pity because it really might have helped you in many 
areas of your life.  The logic of not doing what you don't enjoy, while 
simplistic, can be invaluable to those of us with a tenuous grasp on sanity.

And I'd say its great that you have such  colorful local customs to 
celebrate.  We use a bowl and milk where I come from, but your way 
sounds fun too.
