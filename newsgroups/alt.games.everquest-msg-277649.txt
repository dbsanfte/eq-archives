I managed to fix it in just this manner, after trying loading UI's and
whatnot.  We noticed that only one of his characters had the stuck map
window, so figured it was his UI_{charname}_{server} file, in his
Everquest root directory, that was messed.  Sure enough, his "X"
number was 430 and his "Y" was -41, compared to my 10 and 19,
respectively, so we edited the file, saved it, and everything was fine
after that   :)

Aye, we were going to do this next, if the edit hadn't worked, so I'm
not sure either...

Thanks for your assistance!
