    It's sad how the elemental planes have become so crowded. On my server,
we have three North American guilds, an Asian guild, and an Australian guild
in elementals. The Asian guild is in Time, but only goes there when the
loot-dropping mobs are up in Round 1 and hasn't got past round 2. So for all
intents and purposes they're an elemental guild. Once every three days
there's a flurry of raiding, and then for the next two days everyone does XP
and waits for the server split that will never come.
