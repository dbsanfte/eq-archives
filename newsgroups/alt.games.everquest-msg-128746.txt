While hunting for a Large Field Rat Pelt (needed for Druid armor) I
twice got the TLC message when I killed a Large Field Rat (playing on
FV server, FV's TLC rules mean that any item tagged MAGIC or LORE will
poof if anybody in your group gets no exp for a kill).  I assumed that
this meant that my pelt was being TLC'd (even posted here to rant about
it), but I eventually got a pelt so that wasn't it (I kept killing the
rats after the first TLC message on the theory that they were PH for
Giant Field Rat, which has a rare drop that I still need two more of).
Coupling that with the many different chars I encountered looking for
"rat eye", I suspect that your drop is a rare from a Large Field Rat in
QHills (I don't know of anybody on FV who ever got a "rat eye", a L1 mob
is subject to TLC if you are L5 or higher).

Good Luck.
