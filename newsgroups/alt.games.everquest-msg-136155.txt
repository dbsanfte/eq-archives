How so?  Its accessable from the "birth" zone of
wood elves and many half elves, zone out from
the zone of high elves, across one zone from dwarves,
across two easily crossed zones from gnomes.

Its a zone out from all erudites (paineel or erudin) although
at slight risk, the Tox isn't the safest place in the world
for a just born newbie.  Tox portal is more time consuming
but no more dangerous for a qeynos citizen to reach, a boat
ride to erud places them where the erudites are.  Human
rangers and druids must cross QH, the journey getting longer
but still not dangerous really.  Barbarians have a challenge, they
need to cross Everfrost and then get a light source to cross
the tunnel to blackburrow...

Freeport humans can take the boat to BB, and suffer a more
dangerous (but still hardly insurmountable) run across BB than
the dwarves do.  Ogres and Trolls have a bit of a long but
relatively safe run, thru RM, LR, SK to the NK portal, and
have to swim a bit to avoid the bridge guards.  Still pretty trivial.

Oddly, Halflings and Dark Elves are the hardest put to get to
nexus on their own power.  Halflings can manage it by running
Kith by day, then crossing WC (which can be scary when very
young) EC, FP and the boat route... DE... well they can run
all the way down to Innothule and across but that means facing
Oasis and SRo.

All of this is of course trivial to an experienced EQ player, but
a newbie armed with good maps can make the trips the way
I suggest here.

Hmm, leaves out Iksar.  Hard run for them, I must admit.  Once
they get to DL valley its easy... but thats an exciting little run.
And Vah Shir, oddly the hardest of them all.  Paladul Caverns..
I was forced to resort to invis potions each time I brought one
of my four Vah Shir lowbies across that zone.  Sneak just doesn't
make it, there are spots where overlapping views from KOS mobs
don't let you pass behind them all.  A rogue could do it, but the
rest of the cats are SOL on SOL!
