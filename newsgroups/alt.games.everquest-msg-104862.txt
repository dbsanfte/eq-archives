Actually, the exploit with DS stacking (which may have
been fixed today) goes like this - Mage casts his DS
(Cadeau 33pts), bard uses his bracer to put a ds on
(stacks, as it's supposed to), druid cast his DS, which
overwrites the bard ds - but NOT the mage DS.  Then
bard uses bracer to put his ds back on.  Then uses
amplification with a DS song to boost it yet further.

That's in the range of 80+ DS right there, without
such things as the ring and potions.  I've heard
stories of 150+ ds's and even a 202 (not sure what
all was involved there).
