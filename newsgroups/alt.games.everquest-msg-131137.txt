OK, I have verified the 2 suggestions that were mentioned and the EAP
service is disabled on my system and sill no good it is not on a time
interval rather it is a random event for the packets to just stop coming in
to the system, my other system is pinging bertoxxulous.everquest.com just
fine the whole time...this is just weird.
My wife's system is a ME system and she is not getting disconnected at all.
I think it is time to break down and phone TS at VI as the support section
on the site has nothing to offer.
Any other suggestions you have I will be glad to try.
Dave
