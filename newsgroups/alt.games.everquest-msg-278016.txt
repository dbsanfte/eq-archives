Anyhoo, some interesting changes coming down the pipe.  The short
list:
=============
#  Arena champions: Take the form of new exotic creatures, or fight as
yourself, in battles for glory against other creatures or players.
# New movement: Search for treasure and find adventure in new areas by
climbing up and down walls for the first time in an MMO.
# Voice-over emotes: Express yourself in a battle or expand your
social circle with new voice emotes.
# Guild vaults: Share the loot of a hard won battle with the rest of
your guild members.
# Level range increase: Now play up to level 60!
# New land: Discover over a dozen new zones and epic encounters.
# New creatures: Test your combat skills in battles with over 40 new
fearsome creatures.
===================

It'll be interesting to see how the PvP plays out.  I'm kinda tempted
if its just going to be one-on-one.  We'll have to see what the
"creature" open ends up being.  If it ends up being Tekken 6: Rat
Fighter, I might pass.

The Level 60 increase seems kinda soon though.  I don't know if the
game is that empty of top end content.  The tiering system in the game
means it probably won't effect me til I'm closer to the (current)
endgame, which also mean I can probably take a pass on the expansion
until I'm ready to explore it.

As for Splitpaw, having level-adjusted  instanced dungeons sounds a
lot like LDoN.  Fine by me.  Making the same content accessible to a
wide range of people is cool.  I think it's one of the mistakes they
made with the first Adventure Pack.  The high level players had
already moved past it by the time it was released.

As always though, with SoE, we'll have to see how the grand ideas
actually work in the real world.
