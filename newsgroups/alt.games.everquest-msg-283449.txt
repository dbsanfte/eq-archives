Not to belabor the point (though that seems to be what I'm doing), but
the move to Verant was about establishing a dev company with a
blockbuster on their resume.  The idea was to get EQ published with
their name on it, then be able to do what they wanted on the next
game.

The team didn't get a wild hair or move on to the next big thing, they
finished EQ and even went back into the fold to work on expansions and
EQ2.  Not that either one went the way they expected but the point is
they didn't just jump ship, they had a plan.  Not all plans work I
guess.

With Sigil though, things look a might different.  I expect only time
will tell though.
