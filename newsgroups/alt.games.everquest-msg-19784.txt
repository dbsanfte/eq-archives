That's not what Absor's saying.

What he is saying is that non-assholes are going to have RL
friends on the new server (which is presumably why they're
switching servers in the first place), and those friends will
be able to help the "naked switcher" get re-equipped, either
by donating equipment to them, or helping them adventure to
pick up what they need.

A jerk moving to escape his reputation, however, isn't going
to *have* any friends waiting for them on the new server (and
in fact may not have any friends *anywhere*), and thus will
be totally on their own when it comes to trying to rebuild
a set of equipment.

Speaking of which, a jerk is a jerk is a jerk, and when the
jerk who has switched servers tries to enlist help to get new
equipment, he's going to be as abrasive and obnoxious to his
new server-mates as he was back on the server he had to escape
from.  How many times have you had someone ask you for help,
but be so demanding or otherwise offensive that you'd be
damned if you'd lift a finger to assist them?

No, jerks who switch servers in an attempt to escape their
reputations won't find any refuge on their new servers.

That's overstating the case.  I have in my head a list of
about ten people who were either so obnoxious, or so
dangerously incompetent, that I know to steer *way* clear
of them whenever I encounter them again.

I once lived in a small town of 8000 people (which is about
the total population size of an Everquest server).  While I
never came close to knowing everyone there, of course, I
sure as hell easily remembered the ones who were assholes,
and recognized them when I encountered them again.  And I
didn't need to write their names down to do it.
