His right if your getting beat on your letting the mobs get to close. I have
reinforced
and some Tizmac armor but it will never protect me from getting whumped big
time if I
let them hit me. You need to practice kiting if soloing and make sure you
know where
those zones are and run to them if need be. If you group make sure it's a
big group with a tank or two that can take the beating. Right now I'm trying
to get enough money together for mana and wisdom items that's what you need
most.
