While these will be out of your price range for a while they are
all attainable without raiding, and worn by my druid:

Boots of Flowing Slime (FT3) Rare drop from rare pop in CT sewers
Wanderers Sylvan Bracerx2 (FT2) Ornate bracelet pattern from POP
Belt of Thunderous Auras (FT2) Rare drop from BOT

There may be more out there, but thats all I have for now. FT tends
to be, in my opinion, extremely overpriced, so I tend to go hunt it
up myself.

A good cheap improved damage item is the sand belt from LDON, a more
expensive alternative is the ceramic incense burner of ro. Wanderers
sylvan sleeves (Ornate again) will give you improved heal IV. 

Dont forget to pick up an extended range item either, a nice simple
one can be snagged off the hands in karnors keep.
