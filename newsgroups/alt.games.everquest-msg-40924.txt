 Raster has an advantage though of being soloable. Pawbuster (Pawduster.
Whatever his name is) camp in Karnors is so much worse in my opinion
because a lot of times it's either camped or you can't get a group
together to go there. Pawbuster definitely isn't a solo camp.

 The Chardok pipe isn't much better with the exception that if you can
get a group together you can normally find the tunnel uncamped.
