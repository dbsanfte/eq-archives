Actually, IIRC, Verant has been saying it is not the movement of the leaves,
but the number of polygons that have to be drawn that cause the lagging.  As
to whether that's the sheer number of leaves, or polygons elsewhere in the
trees, doesn't really matter, the point is the same, my setup works great
anywhere except for those Kunark, and presumably Velious, zones where there
are boatloads of trees.  In FV, it works great right up until I walk over to
where those trees are.  In most of Warslik it sucks.  I have tried it both
with glide, and without, same problem.
