Subject: Here's another EQ problem (regarding system, not game)

Okay, I'm an avid EQ player with two L50's and a L14 Magician and I have been
having some trouble with EQ for a few months now. 

Here's the problem. When Luclin (note: I don't have Luclin yet ) was put up I
went through all the procedures and then I was supprised to see the login
(server) screen completely black until the screen flashed, then it went to
black again. I suspected it was just a glich and thought nothing more of it.
The char logon screen was tinted more white than usual and again I thought
nothing of it, but when I logged on I was shocked of what I saw. Nothing! I
switched the in-game screen options and the only way I could see anything was
to use the no menu, full-screen option. I logged out and changed the settings
systematically until I got it working. The problem with EQ now is I have to run
it in 1024x768 with no sound or social animation.

System Properties:
Processor: Intel P2 450 mhz
RAM: 128 MB
Video Card:ATI Rage
Sound Card: Soundblaster 3.1
