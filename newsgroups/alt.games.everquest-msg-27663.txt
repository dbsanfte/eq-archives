In answer to your unasked question, generally speaking (with the older
quests), simply saying "what about a " before the bracketed words will work.

I was in Sol Ro a number of months back when I was in a weird mood.  I had
to talk to a stuck up bitch (high elf, of course) NPC.  I told her something
like "What about a stone, bitch?" ... and she answered me.

...so did a player that was within earshot.  Oops!  She took minor offense
to my use of the curse, so I did the only mature thing...I apologized (well,
I typed it, anyway...I didn't feel sorry for using it :) ).
