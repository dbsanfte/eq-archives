I really enjoyed reading that post! Lots of memories of days long gone 
resurfaced and brought a smile back on my face. :) The most elaborate 
box I ever encountered was the one of the German game "Kaiser" in about 
1986. It looked like a heavy tome, with imprinted gold lettering and 
cords. It was 129 German Marks, about 80 dollars at the time, and it was 
unlike anything I had ever seen before. :) I still have it, too!
