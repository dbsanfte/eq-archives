    We're thinking about it. ;-) Oddly enough, one place we've found that is
good for XP is Veeshan's Peak, in the area around Silverwing and Hosh's
lairs. You need to clear those dragons out first though, and as one
guildmember said, "I'm NOT going on a raid so an XP group can be set up that
won't invite me anyways."

    And even more of a problem is the fact that a lot of the areas where one
CAN go get XP will have non-trivial key quests to get in. Unless.... how
tough do you think old world guildmasters would be to a group of level 65
players, and what do you suppose their respawn rate is? We might just find
out after all if that's planar armour on the Rivervale GMs! Maybe that's why
there's supposedly quests in PoP where you turn in "old items" - they knew
we'd be chain-killing trainers in Rivervale!
