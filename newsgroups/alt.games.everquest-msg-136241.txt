I call your attention to my sig line, repeated below, for a learned
opinion contrary to yours.  A few studies, including one by the office
of the Auditor General of Canada, also disagree with you and state
that the net financial impact on the government is non-existent.
Speaking personally, while the lack of same-sex spousal recognition in
Canada prior to Jan. 1, 2001, cost me several thousand in tax credits,
it also resulted in my being granted $5000 more in student grants
before that.

This is rather moot for me anyway.  Given the recent court ruling
same-sex marriage is a foregone conclusion in Canada, even if things
are slightly delayed by a potential appeal.  Homophobes are no longer
relevant.

I find that there is no merit to the argument that the rights and
interests of heterosexuals would be affected by granting same-sex
couples the freedom to marry...
