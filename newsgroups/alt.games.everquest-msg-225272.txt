Haste spells don't "stack".  Ever.

Ever.

If it looks like it's stacking, it's not.  If someone tells you they are
stacking, they are wrong.

Ever.

There are three kinds of haste.  You can have one of each.  That's it, *one*
of each.

Spell haste - burnout, shaman haste, enchanter haste
Item haste - any item that says "haste"
Song "over"haste - One of three or four bard songs that are 100% unique in
this ability.

If you have two spell haste buffs in your window, *one* of them is giving
you your haste.  If you have two items that say "haste", *one* of them is
giving you your haste.  There are no exceptions to this rule (yet).
