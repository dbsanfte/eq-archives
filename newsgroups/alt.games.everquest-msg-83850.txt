    Why can't camps stay, well, camped in one spot? :-) Try a Remedy before
running after them - it's got a nice, long range.

    How's your smithing? Mine languished at 179 or so - I sold my 100-odd
Leather Backings the day before the "metal sheets are stackable" patch, and
never took it back up. Sold my stack and a half of Earthen Tempers, too. :-/

    I swear that warriors love death more than necromancers. :-)

    Sebilis, Ilis Jail (the lower portal). Once you start pulling some
'Shrooms to camp you should see it. That's not a casual place, though -
pulling unstunnable cleric mobs is never fun. You'll require a high-level
ENCH if you venture down there. Once you get the hang of it, though, you'll
have a blast.
