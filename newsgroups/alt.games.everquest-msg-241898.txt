Why have the media refused to report this story? Malaika Tamu Griffin
murdered Jason Horsely four and half years ago in Denver Colorado. After
murdering Jason Horsley because he was White she fled to Chicago, where
Farrakhan's Nation of Islam is based. 

Malaika Tamu Griffin has a degree in chemistry, a very useful educational
background for building bombs. Malaika Tamu Griffin has traveled
extensively throughout Europe previous to her racist murder of Jason
Horsley. 

Is Malaika Tamu Griffin now a member of Al Qaida? Is the FBI really
looking for her? Why has the New York Times never once mentioned the name
of Malaika Tamu Griffin? A search of the archives at the New York Times
for " Malaika Tamu Griffin" yields the following:

"There were no matches for your search "Malaika Tamu Griffin" / since
1996"

It seems that "African Americans" who murder White folks in cold blood are
not a concern to the New York Times, or any of the other "mainstream"
media. 

A search of the archives at the Washington Post yields the following
result:

"No Results Found"

Imagine that! The Washington Post is not concerned about a well
educated "African American" terrorist who hates and murders White people.

Shocking!

Let's go to the Los Angeles Times and enter a search for "Malaika Tamu
Griffin" and choose "All dates (January 1985 to present)", and we get:

"No Results Found"

Are you as shocked as I am? Imagine that, the New York Times, the
Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times do not give a flying fuck that
for four and a half years a well educated "African American" murderer has
been roaming free to murder more "crackers", "honkies" and "white devils".


----
Malaika Tamu Griffin is wanted for the murder of twenty-five-year old
Jason Horsely. In early 1999, Griffin was a tenant at a neighboring home
to Mr. Horsely and his girlfriend, Deborah Loiselle. On April 20, 1999, on
their first encounter Ms. Loiselle was threatened by Ms. Griffin who
expressed anti-white animus and stated that she would kill her and kill
her dogs . Mr. Horsely and Ms. Loiselle are white and Ms. Griffin is
African-American. Ms. Griffin continued her tirades against her neighbors
despite the fact that there was no actual provocation.

On the evening of May 18, 1999, Mr. Horsley was assembling carpentry tools
on a public sidewalk near Ms. Griffin's house. After Ms. Griffin verbally
castigated Horsely, Ms. Loiselle entered the argument. Both females
returned to their residences and Jason resumed his work. Shortly
thereafter and without warning Ms. Griffin returned to the sidewalk armed
with a laser-sighted 9mm pistol and shot Mr. Horsely in the back at
point-blank range. Mr. Horsely died minutes later from a fatal heart
wound. 

While in immediate flight Ms. Griffin encountered an acquaintance who she
proceeded to carjack at gunpoint. Ms. Griffin drove to Iowa and proceeded
to board a bus to Chicago where she was last seen. 

A police search of Griffin's Denver residence uncovered a cache of
ammunition, diffused hand grenades, a 9mm assault rifle and manuals
popular with terrorists including The Anarchist's Cookbook and The Poor
Man's James Bond. Police also found notebooks with Griffin's opinions
about a coming race war and the necessity of killing white people. None of
her colleagues or close friends ever heard her express the types of racist
rhetoric she wrote in her notebooks.

Ms. Griffin has a BS in Chemistry from Jackson State University where she
graduated magna cum laude. She has experience in production laboratory and
chemical research settings. Ms. Griffin's primary area of expertise are in
the analysis of organic compounds by high pressure liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using ultraviolet and fluorescence detectors and ion chromatography
for the determination of anions in air and water. She has also worked in
pharmacies.

She should be considered extremely dangerous
