If there are less than 4 mobs in melee range all agro'd mobs will head
towards you (well, pathing may give them a rather goofy idea of just
what "towards you" means).  It's when four mobs are "in melee" with
you that the others will do something else (seems to be whatever they
were doing before agro'd, either stand still or wander about).  So,
as long as you stay a couple steps ahead of all but a couple mobs, you
can pull quite a nice train all by your lonesome.  This is, of course,
the key to the "bardic pull", agro everybody and his brother while
flying about at supersonic speed.
