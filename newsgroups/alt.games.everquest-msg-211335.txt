Ouch, sorry to hear that. I didn't go straight for Cann5, dinged 61
when PoP came out and went for SC before starting that long, boring
17AA haul to Cann5. ... now I don't see how I ever lived without it!

I guess I'm lucky in that I never have any trouble motiving my friends
to crawl a dungeon for loot sometimes instead of the constant,
mindless PoP AA grind. 80K covered Quiessence, BoS, FA and most of my
63-64 spells. Fo7 is around 50k so it's gonna be a while before I
splurge for that one, and malos at 10k just isn't worth it given that
I have Malo. 

Rgds, Frank
