I never bound there, but I did camp on one of the lifts in Gfaydark once, a
long time ago.  Fortunately, I didn't die when I logged back in.  The only
death loop experience I had was in Qeynos, I was bound at the docks there,
came back in by ship, and Trumpy and Barstomper(?) his friend were nowhere
to be seen, sat down near the dock was talking with a friend.  Suddenly I am
getting pounded on by Trumpy and Barstomper.  I tried to run, didn't get
far, was killed.  Respawn, start running immediately, made it halfway to the
zone, was killed.  Respawn, fortunately, now they are far enough away, I
loot my first corpse, and get the heck out of Dodge.  I had completed the
Bloodforge Hammer quest a couple of times, and then killed him again for
good measure later on.
