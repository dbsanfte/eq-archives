Well you got the right race. Nice twink job so far.

I'd get the Grey flesh gloves:

Grey Flesh Gloves  +6 AC +10 Dex +6 Wis +6 Int +10 vsCold
+20 HP +25 Mana +1.00 Wt   The Grey  Affliction Efficiency II

Focus effects rule.

Do the coldain military wristguard quest. Very easy quest for
a great focus effect item.

Coldain Military Wristguard  +10 AC +5 Str +6 Wis +5 vsMg
+5 vsCold +5.00 Wt   Great Divide  Extended Affliction III

As you level start getting Sarnak faction to do the Spirit wracked
cords quest.

Spirit Wracked Cord (Wrist)(Arms)(Shoulders)   +12 AC +5 Sta +5 vsMg
+10 vsCold +100 HP +0.50 Wt   Chardok  Aura of Battle

100 hit points and 2 ticks of regen. Plus it can be worn in 3 places
so you can move it to your weakest slot. Must have item for a necro.
