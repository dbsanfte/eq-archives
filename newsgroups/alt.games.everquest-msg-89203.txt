Is there any place in Freeport to purchase the raw materials necessary to 
create a skinning knife?

I am a smith and a tailor friend of my needs a skinning knife.  I have 
looked everywhere to find the hilt and dagger blade molds and cannot find 
them anywhere.  I looked online to try to find where they may be and the 
places they mention are in Freeport, but I cannot find them.  Have they 
been removed from these locations?  (Dagger in West Freeport in a white 
building, hilt in blue building in East Freeport)  I am on the Tunare 
server if that makes any difference.

Quoted above Lars mentions where they can be found in Neriak.  I am 
relativly new to the game, playing my first character.  I am level 17 
currently.  I am in Freeport.  Would it be possible for a Level 17 to make 
it over to Neriak to find these molds?

Thanks
