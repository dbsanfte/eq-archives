Your BEST bet - assuming you can't find any help in the zone - would be to
log off, go to a map site (www.eqatlas.com ), download, and print a Tim Deep
map then log back on and start working on your swimming skill, aiming for
the island that has the shuttle that takes you to Oasis.

OR you can swim to where the boat zones into TD from BB, and wait for it.
Once it zones in, you SHOULD be able to climb up on the rudder before the
boat starts moving.  That'll take you all the way to FV.  Keep in mind that
you don't have to rush to get on the rudder...the boat sits there for a few
minutes, so don't panic or anything. :)   This is actually your best bet if
you're decent at locs.
