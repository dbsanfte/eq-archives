Which initially sounds totally unworkable, but...

1) In EQ, one "server" is actually multiple physical machines.  I'm
   sure this is also the case in AO.

2) AO has dynamically generated missions, available only to you and
   your group.  i.e., competition for quests & spawns should be greatly
   mitigated by this.

Still, 50000 people in one world is a lot.  I guess only time will tell
if it's workable (and Funcom have said they'll introduce new servers if
necessary).

I'll be trying AO out.  It sounds like fun, and even if it's a
disaster, the worst that happens is I waste a month or two's
subscription money.
