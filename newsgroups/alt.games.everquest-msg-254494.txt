 In EQ there are three factors on what equipment you use:
1) What you can afford
2) If you meet the item lvl requirement
3) What no-drop item mobs you can kill

This is the typical way I do it:

I go to the Bazaar every couple of weeks and do searches for my Class/Race 
and then each item I know I want to upgrade, or go through each item I have 
to see if there are better items that I can afford.  If there are I either 
buy them and sell the old ones, or write up a list for later.

You can also go to http://www.magelo.com/ --> Forums-->Profiles and look at 
profiles of other characters in your class and pick out items you like, then 
do a price check on eqprices.com

Or use http://eq.crgaming.com/data/items.asp and look up items for your 
class.

Hope this helps.  Good luck
