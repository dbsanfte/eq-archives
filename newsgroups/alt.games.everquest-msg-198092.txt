rofl.  That gnoll chain (I presume you speak of the Ruined Gnoll Chain,
which is the only chain I've ever seen drop in BB) is piss poor armor.
It's actually there, along with the Ruined Gnoll Leather, as quest drops
for Qeynos/SFG newbie armor quests.  And I must say that it was pretty
annoying to have all those ignorant Barbarians wearing my quest drops
when Stromm opened  :-p  Although I guess I shouldn't be too surprised
at Barbs liking armor equivalent to very heavy cloth that stinks to high
heaven of dog urine  :-p   Still, it was irritating to have even more
competitors than all the other folks questing the stuff.
