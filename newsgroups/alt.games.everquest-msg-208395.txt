Hmmm...buy the more expensive version, get a nice in-game item?  Basically,
they are selling a nice bag for real world money.  I wonder how long until
there is an official way to buy plat and items for real money, or transfer
characters and accounts for a fee?

It might not even be that bad.  I used to think that if Sony sold plat and
items, it would ruin the game for people who don't buy items.  However,
they've made the game big enough now that there's probably room for
everyone--if some people decked out with a few hundred dollars worth of
equipment are able to monopolize and area, I can just go somewhere else.
