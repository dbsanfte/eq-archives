You were doing good right up until that last sentence. When another
guild that arrives who is strong enough to get enough keys and kill
warders for Primal, then obvsiously they *could* (either now or very
shortly) wake the sleeper. So, with that in mind, I will edit/add to
your sentence to bring it into the realm of reality.

"They wake the Sleeper *precisely* so the other guild's won't."  Is
there an element of competitivelness, and maintaining a majority of the
primal? I've no doubt there is. But, deny it as you and several other
"angellic" players here try to, if it was YOUR guild that got in there
first, you'd be loading up on all the Primal you could lay your hands
on, because it's top notch gear.  And you'd be watching that Sleeper,
because he can only be woken once. And when Uberguild_Guild_02 showed up
with fifty keys one day, you can damn well rest assured you'd make sure
that if anyone was going to claim the honor of waking him, it would be
you.

That may well apply to Verant for designing that way, true. They made
something that, by design, is going to incite feelings of jealousy,
anger, greed, and division among the ranks of players. But it's there.
(Or was, in many servers cases.) Tell me, Sui. Are you really that much
of a saint? More importantly, is your Guild Leader, *all* of your
officers, and the *majority* of your members *ALL* that much of a bunch
of saints? If you were the first guild on your server with a set of ST
keys, and you'd equipped everyone with primal, and suddenly a new guild
showed up who obviously had the guns to kill Ventani once they figured
it out, what would you do?
1. Nothing. Just go about your business and let them wake the Sleeper if
they want because you're all "better than that".
2. Open a "meaningful dialouge" with the new guild about how "wrong" it
would be to wake the sleeper and how mean it would be to all the tier
two and below guilds who *might* get in there "some day", and trust them
to honor it.
3. Hand over all your strategy secrets to them for how to do the
warders, destroy your keys, and move on because it was "somebody else's
turn now".

Ya know..... even if *you*, in particular, are that much of a fucking
saint, I find it rather hard to believe any guild in the game has a
whole uberguild full of such angels of light and mercy.
