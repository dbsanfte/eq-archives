I have Swiftwind, part of the ranger epic and aprt that tallies very very
closely with the druid epic run.

My guild is small (tiny ,even) and oriented around socialising, not conquest.

I got this far into my epic through bloody determination and the friendships
I'd built - I ran well researched raids with preparation and loot policies
to encourage everyone and at points I even had to throw together "spur
of the moment" raids when something popped. I had half of karnors and friends
from 5 seperate guilds take down Venril Sathir for my stone before any
more organised powerful guilds could come snag it by virtue of hunting there
day in day out watching track and being ready to ooc and send out tells ;)

Anyway, my point is,. if you're after challenging fun it *is* possible to do it
and be proud of it without it becoming a guild activity.

That said, of course, some of my guildies did help and die at various stages
and if they're reading here I lubja ;)

Druids may get a bit passe after a certain level - I think most classes probably
do - but they will *always* be the ultimate tourist class and you will make a 
lot of friends with ports/buffs/heals if you try grouping with people instead 
of just porting them about or dropping a quick sow on them.

Try it - many of my best friends are druids who I met after attempting to be 
particularly charming when begging a port then "tricking" them into staying 
on to group and hunt with me ;)

/em suddenly whips out a paw and runs off barking, your port stick in her 
jaws... best follow to get it back!
