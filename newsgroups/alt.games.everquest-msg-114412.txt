True. However, I have been on too many raids now where that
'policy' becomes written in pencil rather that written in stone like it
should be.

But what if both classes can use the BP. Who decides who 'needs' it more?
I have seen too many cases where someone gets something and then they
quit the guild or the game soon after. /random may suck but its the only fair
way to distribute it.

I agree. If the cleric member agreed to let the tank have the plate drop before
the raid then changed her mind during the drop. However, I have seen too
many cases where one rule applies on one raid, then when something awesome
drops on another raid suddenly its NBG and gee this person needs it more
than that person.

Yes random does sometimes suck, but usually only for the losers.
Unfortunately its the only fair way to do it when more than one person
wants an item. Sucks but that's the way it is. Verant has set the game
up this way, which is stupid.

Example. Went on a dragon raid the other day. Dragon dropped 3 things
(count them 3 things) The dragon took 36 people to bring down. How do
you divide 3 things into 36 people?

Agreed. As long as that policy is written in stone and never changes.
Once someone bends the rules just ONCE then its chaos again.
