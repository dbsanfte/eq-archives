I am just irritated, I don't like anyone who tells me how to use my
mana. Since its my mana to begin with I know better than anyone else
as to what I want to be casting, period.

Ask for buffs, yes, feel free. But if I decline - and I will if I
think its better not to cast it - don't whine about it. Too many think
that they are entitled to any buff I can cast at request. It is not
so.

Today's example was a ranger who wanted strength. The character I was
playing is an enchanter. I already have enough to do. My str buff is
piffless and will do absolutely nothing to speed up the fight
whatsoever, especially on a ranger. I declined the request, and he
chewed me out (I chewed back).

So remember, if any of you think you're entitled to a caster's mana on
request... YOU'RE NOT. Some casters are wet noodles about it and do
whatever you want - those casters hurt their party by not doing what
they know is best just to please someone.
