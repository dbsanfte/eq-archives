PoP was the worst.   For 65 spells you needed Tier 3 minis.  And you were
never guarenteed to get the spell you needed.  You could turn in 20 and still
be getting repeats of the ones you had.

group there was nearly finished with 69 and 70 runes when we quit for WoW and

"We need a new Mario game, where you rescue the princess in the first ten
minutes, and for the rest of the game you try and push down that sick feeling
in your stomach that she's "damaged goods"... When Peach asks you, in the
quiet of her mushroom castle bedroom "do you still love me?" you pretend to be
asleep. You press the A button rhythmically, to control your breath, keep it
even." - Joey Comeau on increased realism in gaming.
