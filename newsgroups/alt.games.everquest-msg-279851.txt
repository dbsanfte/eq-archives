So... you've thrice claimed that you'd simply abstain from the content 
and sacrifice the upgrades if it were that monotonous.

Do you truly not think that there is a game flaw if the content that 
gets you the upgrades is THAT monotonous that you'd rather not even 
play??

And THAT should be the most rewarding.

As a corollary to Vangaurds maxim, you should get "rewarded" by doing 
the "fun stuff" not running treadmill. In Vangaurd the optimal path 
SHOULD be the one that has you exploring new places, completing 
ludicrously difficult quests, trying out new zones...
