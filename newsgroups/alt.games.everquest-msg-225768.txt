Even if I took her surname--which I won't, because a) I don't want one, b)
it'd be bad for my karma, and c) I don't even know what it is--considering
I'm a DE Enchanter and she's a halfling druid, not much chance of us getting
too mixed up.

Luckily one or two of the folks were willing to talk with me about it.  A
few simply decided I'd ripped off their friend, and the rest figured it was
a joke.

By the way, I've been going by that name since pre-EQ, so that little Druid
kiddie can stuff it.  :-)
