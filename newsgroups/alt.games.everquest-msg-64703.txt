Hi,

I just posted a question similar to this on the EQ message board, and
I thought I'd ask here as well...

I am planning to get a new computer system from Dell with the following:

Pentium 4 Processor at 1.6GHz
512MB SDRAM
Microsoft Windows XP
64MB DDR NVIDA GEFORCE3 TI 200 with DVI
Turtle Beach Santa Cruz DSP, Sound Card
56K PCI Data/Fax Modem
16X/10X/40X CD-RW Drive

How well should this setup handle SOL?

Should it give me any problems?

Also, what would be the quickest and easiest way to install EQ on the
new computer? I would like to able to keep the amount of patching to
a minimum.

Right now I have EQ, Kunark, and Velious on my old system, and I plan
to get SOL for my new computer.

I was figuring I would...

Install Orginal EQ..
Then Install Kunark..
Then Velious...

In sucession.. but then what? Should I then copy all of the currently
patched files from my old EQ folder (in my old system) onto my new one
and finally install Luclin.. and then patch?

Or should I install Luclin immediately after Velious and patch?

What would result in the least amount of patching?

Can any one give me some advice Please?

I don't want to have to download 400 files...

What's the quickest, best way to do this?

Many Thanks.

- Mike Dorr
