Yup, lots of times when I'm in a pickup group in DL the people hanging out
waiting for the puller are asking for SoW.  Why?  The only things that'll
kill get your group running for the zone are Gorenaire and that new Iksar
pain-in-the-ass, and if either of THEM are on you you're not likely to make
it to the zone regardless.

It doesn't??  There's little difference between 100 and 255 STR for my twink
22 warrior?  I'm admittedly seriously ignorant about melee classes.  All I
know about warrior is "fast weapons, lots of AC, lots of HP."

Ahh, running speed 3 (AA ability) is nice, isn't it? ;)
