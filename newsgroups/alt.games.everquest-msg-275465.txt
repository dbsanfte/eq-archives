    My guild never made the elementals... so I doubt I'll ever see fire. I
think we had the skillset, the determination and the leadership, just not
the numbers, and the leadership never wanted to form an alliance (which is a

    Damn, there's so much bent appeal in replying to 5 month old threads! I
should find another interesting one to dredge up!
