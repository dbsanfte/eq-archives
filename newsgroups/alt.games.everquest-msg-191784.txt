The EULA is not law folks and carries no force as such. Fact is that
yantis has found a very nice little loophole in the Eula, hes not even
voilating the EULA, check it out hes really not, hence neither are his
customers. 
So no violation of law.
No real violation of EULA, open to opinion for sure.
Now because it somehow violates your sense of fair play its wrong?
Hey I gotta beef with every one of you guys who has time to camp this
crap when I dont, doesnt mean my gripe is ligit does it. But is it
"fair" that you have more time than I while I may have more money?

So heck yes I will buy plat anytime I need it cause I dont have time
to kill 800 hill giants or raid on tier 3 planes but I would like to
enjoy the game since its my time and money not yours. 

Now as for introducing real world money into norath...too late sony
already did that with the paid features of expansions. Having these
expansions yeild one a tremendous advantage over those who dont. So
complain to Sony they started it....
