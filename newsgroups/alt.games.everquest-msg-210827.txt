Found the opposite. Ok, so strength isn't hard to raise at all but starting
with such a low one does cause some problems with weight. Stamina is another
kettle of fish, there are few items that raise stamina that aren't then
traded out for better AC or Haste...Low levels we are talking here.
Sure the Crafted BP has 6 stamina and a BA Girdle another 5 but the Crafted
would likely get replaced with Treeweave, early on and the Girdle with an
FBSS...That's 11 stamina gone and no easy way to replace it. With plat
behind the character it isn't that hard but without it, it's a struggle.

Stamina is the only melee stat that makes any noticable difference to your
character, sure someone gives you 100 dex or agil buff you will very likely
see a difference in crits/procs and, maybe, avoidance but we are not going
to be talking 100 increase more like 20 at the most and that sort of
difference would not be noticable.

The only advantage I have so far found of having a high agility to start (my
natural one is 105) is that when someone casts Beserker spirit on me my
Agility doesn't fall below 75 and so I don't take a horrendous AC hit....But
these days Beserker Spirit doesn't last that long on slowed mobs, let alone
unslowed ones :)
