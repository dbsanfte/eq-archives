I disagreed with what he wrote (IMO what he wrote was wrong) and thats what
I said.

He replied with an abusive rant, insulting me and swearing at me.  Whilst I
could have worded one line of my post better then I did (in response to some
stuff about taunt i disagreed with, i said something along the lines of
"thats crap") i did not start the childish arguing and swear filled posts.

Compare the insults by either side, and in what order, whilst I will argue
back with him to the end, you will see I haven't resorted to just downright
insulting him. Thats more then can be said for him.

Maybe he does have more credibility in peoples eyes then I do, but it sure
doesn't make him any more right in his views and what he says.
