The only thing we can be sure of, is that Sony doesn't stop many activities
which may or may not be in breach of law relating to their IP / Copyright.

Saying, "Sony has done nothing so far, it's legal" doesn't make it legal.
Up until the point where Sony had them closed last time, people would have
been claiming the same thing, and were wrong.

I believe it's quasi-legal, you believe it's not, I'm not trying to
convince you otherwise, no need to try and convince me.

I do think it's misguided to send a prospective new player to a
non-official server.  Better to try the (entirely free) version first, and
if that doesn't suit, or for counterpoint, have a go on the fan-run
version.  But at least ensure that the person understands that while Sony
has not taken steps yet, it may do so in the future, and until it posts an
endorsement of SoD, I will continue to believe it's at risk.
