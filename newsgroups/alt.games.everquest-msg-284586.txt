One hotbar is one window in your interface. Each hotbar have 10 pages
(Reached by the two arrows in each window or by shift+number by default
for hotbar1)
The keybindings for hotbar1 is being used on the currently visible page
of hotbar1. To see another hotbar click the EQ button and find it
there, or assign a key to Toggle Hotbar2 in options>keys>ui.

Its up to your own preference what you want to do. If you mostly play
using the keyboard  you might prefer to use one hotbar and utilize all
of its pages. Its easy to switch pages (shift+#) and then click the
hotbuttons on that page (#).

If you prefer clicking hotbuttons with your mouse you might find it
much more convenient to have two or more hotbars up at the same time.
This way you can easily click your mouse on the visible buttons without
having to switch pages.
