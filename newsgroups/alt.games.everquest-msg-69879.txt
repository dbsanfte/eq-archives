Hi All!

I'm having a blast with my level 30 Iksar SK.

Granted, I used my 55 Druid to twink him (full set of DreadScale, except for
Mask), Hero's Khukri (can you say 20 hours of camping Dalnir?) and other
items, but...

I noticed while spending hours in Dalnir, not one person popped in looking
for Imprecators (drop SK Epic items, Bo Stick and Bard Ancient Coin).

Is Skayle such a minority? He is more fun to play than my Druid ever was, he
can cast, melee and looks great!

After getting his Hero's Khukri I took him to the moon to play the lowbie
areas and am having a blast. Skayle never has problems finding a group, and
he gets added to many friends lists!

I RP him to the hilt, threatening to kill the family of every non-Iksar I
group with, and referring to them as soft-skins, yet never fail to get
Bound, buffed and assisted wherever I take him!

Anyway - just wondering how many Iksar SK's are out there, and am I setting
myself up for a post 50 career as a shriveled, reptile warrior-wannabe in a
state of perpetual Hell?

Skayle 30 SK Erollisi Marr aka Drywit
