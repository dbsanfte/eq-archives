I've always felt that unless they are married in RL, EQ weddings are just 
silly, and even then I'm not a big fan. Aside from those instances I don't 
believe that the majority of the others occur in the interest of good role-
playing and therefore are merely chat room style nonsense likely serving no 
purpose other than to take their cybering to the next level.

This is just my own opinion of course.
