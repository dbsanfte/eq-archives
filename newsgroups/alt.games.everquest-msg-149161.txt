Exactly.

I can't see incompetent lvl 60's being too much of
a problem for competent raiding groups.

The other thing is, that I doubt the highest level
would be available to buy. In UO, apparently, when
you buy,  you can give your character only up to
85% of a skill. You have to earn the last 15%.

I can see them working it in gradually in EQ, so
as not to frighten of too many people at once.

I like EQ fine, though I don't get enough time to
play it.

I'm only the piano-player, my only argument is
that pre-made characters will be available
sometime, and that when they do, I will consider
taking advantage.

Everything has its price, doesn't it?
