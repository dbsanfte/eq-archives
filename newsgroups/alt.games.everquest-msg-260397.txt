Ok well at one point I thought I remembered I was pissing off a monk 
that was trying to train-feign my group (I had punted him because he was 
ninjaing everything) by using some relativly long casting enchanter buff 
on him as he came in. He would come around the corner, I'd start 
casting, he'd feign at my feet, spell would land, mobs would slaughter 
him, then turn to me next (who would mez them and line them up for my 
group).

At least that's how it seemed to be working. Mind you I know that Feign 
death has gone through at least 1 major upheaval since then (I was like 
level 20.... this was pre-Kunark iirc, or not long after Kunark... We 
were getting that big lake rathe xp...)

Anyway you other people, listen to others, they've played more recently 
than I have. And played a monk past 27 most likely.
