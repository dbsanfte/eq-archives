(A fuse blows in Fooboy's head)

I could not bear yet another a know nothing (YAKN) playing out there
in Everquest.

You can't even type E-B-A-Y-.-C-O-M and buy a stupid guide to power
leveling and plat selling secrets. How many are out there? Billions,
trillions? Heck, Yantis must have one on every one of his sites. I
imagine anyone who thought they could make a living off everquest put
out a guide for $10.

No, you need a P-lvl guide for free. You can't figure out how to power
level without being told how to do it? Guess what sunshine, you won't
find many sympathetic ears here. A lot of us are sick of people who
want to skip as much content as possible, and power game through
Everquest.

Have I got high level buffs? Sure, and I got nice toys from friends
too. I never made a friend sit around and watch me kill mobs so I can
get through levels 10-46 in a day. I get help from friends, and I have
asked for buffs, but I can count on my hand the amount of times I
asked for a friend to heal me or use atone to help me XP, and that was
to finish a mostly completed level.

Who the hell needs power leveling when you have the freaking Pal
Caverns, and  the other XP boosted zones in the game now a days. You
can get a level a day many places in EQ now, without having to be such
a miscreant as to have a friend PL you.

Your skills never get caught up on a PL, and your offense usually
stinks. Having a 65th level Pally with an offense of 50 stinks for the
party you are tanking, much less that pally who can't play his class
because he never played it.

AHHH! AHHHHHHHH! AHHHHHHHHHH! (smoke) FZZZZZZZZzzzzz! Bixplipop!

Lance kicks him in the butt)

Sorry, I only meant to say:
