I am asking about characters level 45 or higher.
I am also assuming a player can generate a minumum of 50 - 60p an hour
hunting and killing and still getting exp.
Is there any trade skill which can reliably generate earnings above 60p an
hour.
I see 10 shot sow potions and 10 slot bags selling pretty regularly. I also
see high end jewelry sell for considerbly more than the ingrediants.
I have seen some formulas for making money baking but they seem geared
towards low level characters.
I learned pottery to make Thurgadin gate potions, but I see no way to make
money with this skill.
