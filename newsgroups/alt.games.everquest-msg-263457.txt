On the contrary!  I have evidence that guards assist when I'm
fighting a wisp.  It was one of my first times fighting wisps,
in N Kar, and I had gone to a top-down camera to make it
easier for me to run after the wisp.  (Else it would run out
of my field of view before I could see which way it was going.)
Just like a true will'o'wisp out of legend, it led me into a
trap.  Next thing I knew, my Iksar butt was being kicked by
two guards.  They'd obviously come to assist.  Assist the wisp,
that is.
