    One thing I haven't seen you mention is cheating with the buffs. If this
is a guild/larger group thing, have them all come to the trials and make
sure you have every possible buff before going in. Something as simple as
getting SP from your BST friend and a mod rod, or Focus/Khura's+Brute on
yourself could be the edge you need in mana efficiency. Making a day of it
and getting everyone there helps keep spirits up, too.

    Shaman can replace the enchanter directly if he has Tigir's and can tank
a slowed mob without crumpling. That was my experience when I did it,
anyways - loss of mez was compensated for by speed of slowdown, greater
efficiency of Turgur's, DPS brought by the SHM (pet/right clicks), greater
ability of the SHM to tank, and ability of the SHM to heal and regen mana.

    Paladin will be tough if he can't tank as well as you and deal damage
like you. He might be able to replace the druid, and use some of his healing
ability to free up the cleric for a few nukes, but it'll be touch-and-go
killing things fast enough. And you lose Banishment, which seems to be key
to you. Good luck!
