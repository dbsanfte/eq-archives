My wife and i played EQ for over a year (almost two years for my wife) and
we too think DAoC is superior to EQ. For us that is. Meaning it could be
different for you. The two games are a lot similar, with their strength and
weaknesses.
DaoC is more geared toward casual players (meaning less downtime for HP/mana
recov, blue/yellow monsters soloables up to lvl 50, anti
twink/farmer/trainer codes) and Medieval (Vikings, Albions, Irish faeries)
while EQ is more Uber (Planar travels, Lots of Uber Dungeons and Epic super
hard to get equipement favorizing Hard Core gamers) and Fantasy oriented
(Lots of different zones and monsters coming from D&D style adventures).
So, to us, DAoC has much less frustration (corpse recov ? Camping for days ?
Camp stealing ? Training ? I've seen none of those in more than 3 months of
play in DAoC) and more fun to offer (Lots of quests and tasks up to lvl 30 ,
less at those levels and up but more and more are getting implemented /
actually rewarding loot from dungeons and even outside hunting, even under
lvl 30/ Enjoyable and ACCESSIBLE trade skills that you can even make money
with, even if they've been nerfed due to the usual presence of some stupid
exploiters that over used the system to make insane amount of cash / and a
much more player oriented company -MYTHIC- that has shown respect and
attention to their players base)
As for what the game has really to offer to an ex-EQer ... don't expect to
see as much dungeons and zones as in EQ for now. We are far from it. I'd say
DAoC at this point as perhaps 1/10th of the zones EQ offers. But it's
growing (we just had our new Epic Zones added, with a Dragon having an AI
that supposedly would send back Nagaffen to kindergarden. DaoC has problems,
the balance is not perfect (to me, it's still better than the balance in EQ
though), and some people will tell you that the main point of the game -RVR-
is not accessible to under 35 as for now and soon not under 40. I'd say : 1)
blame the power gamers 2) I am sure all can contribute and eventually we
will all enjoy RvR and have a Blast ! ;)
See you soon i hope in Daoc.
