Hahaha, that sounds like me after I found out that others on this group
had gotten the invite.  (I mean, on this newsgroup...has anyone else been
as gung-ho and talkative about EQ2 as I have been for as long? Give me
some recognition SOE!  Or, err, wait, they don't come to this NG.  D'oh. )

Till I realized it was just LoE/Legends folks, and I was quiescent. Now
when someone here admits they were part of the open application
process...THEN I'll start up my batch of emails.

Or not. :P
