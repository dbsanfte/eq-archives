/sigh.  I guess I was a wee bit more harsh than necessary.  The
miserable head cold and splitting headache I'm enduring atm seems
to have completely eroded my tolerance.  I just can't believe that
somebody would post "They are most definitely not [easy to level]"
when anybody with one eye, two fingers, and an IQ within twenty
points of room temperature can level a Druid to 50.

Their kills are still much faster than mine.  Let me repeat:  their
kills are still much faster than mine.  An unimpressively equipped
53 Druid can outsolo my 54 Paladin, against the same mobs, with zero
risk, killing at better than twice my pace, and be working on a
tradeskill at the same time.  As for getting slow experience in
groups, solo druids are rarely skillful in groups.  When I partner
with a Druid who mostly solos it seems to take forever to convince
them <not> to heal me unless my health falls under two bubbles and
mob is still over half.  They'll waste their mana on heals instead
of using it to kill the mob, and then they have to med.  It is
possible for a Druid's kill rate to be slower partnered than solo
(I've seen it done), all it takes is poor use of mana.  OTOH, a
Druid who is skilled in groups (i.e. has a lot of experience and
has experimented with a wide variety of tactics) can be worth as
much (or sometimes more) to a group as a Bard or an Enchanter in
situations where mez/charm is not a requirement, this is especially
true of small groups (2 to 4).  But, to be valuable you have to be
knowledgeable and skillful, and to be knowledgeable you need to
experiment, to be skillful you need to practice.  If you solo all
the way to 50 you're probably gonna have a tough time learning how
to support a group decently.

Kaev <--- who still does not feel bad about having a poor opinion
of the mental faculties of a person with multiple characters over
50, including a Druid, who calls Druids "hard to level" or "hard
to solo" -- boring maybe, but if you want hard solo an untwinked
Warrior to 50 (or untwinked Rogue to 40)
