All data taken from Lucy:


Pacification (CLR/65 ENC/62):  65
Max duration of 7.5 minutes at L65 (subtract 0.1 minute per level).

Wake of Tranquility (CLR/55 ENC/51):  60
Max duration of 7.5 minutes at L65 (subtract 0.1 minute per level).

Pacify (CLR/39 PAL/51 ENC/39):  55
Max duration of 7.5 minutes at L65 (subtract 0.1 minute per level).

Calm (CLR/19 PAL/49 ENC/20):  50
Max duration is 3.0 minutes at L20

Soothe (CLR/9 PAL/30 ENC/8):  40
Max duration is 2.5 minutes at L15

Lull (CLR/1 PAL/15 ENC/1):  30
Max duration is 2.0 minutes at L5 (subtract 0.2 minutes per level)

Note also that Calm, Soothe, and Lull do not reduce the frenzy radius

quite as severely as their higher level cousins, or that's how I'm
reading the numbers, it's not 100% clear.
