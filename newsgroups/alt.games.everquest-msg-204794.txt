I killed a number of poor young druids just this way, by running
innocently around in wolf form myself, sitting next to gaurds between
giant pulls and such, when I was a young cleric hunting in GD with a druid
friend.  Note that the druid in question was -not- in wolf form, just me,
if she tried it she was still dog meat.

Anyway, they'd see me, decide the rumors that wolf form was KOS were false
and slap their own on, only to get chased straight into the waterfall and
certain death.

Then I'd come rez them, -still- in wolf form, trying not to type /lol /lol
/lol /lmaorotflap

"Hey," says the formerly dead druid, looking from his dead wolf body to my
clearly live wolf form, and then to the inside the waterfall guard
contingent, "how come they aren't killing -you- in wolf form"?

"Oh, this isn't normal wolf form, its Coldain Tracking Wolfform, cleric of
Brell only you know."
