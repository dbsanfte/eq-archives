My wife has been watching me play EQ for about 1 year now and she usually
likes me to play games, it gives her some time to herself, but last night
she said...
"I don't like that game you play..."
"Why" I responded
"Because you can't win"..she said
I was kind of taken back...I stopped playing for a min, thought about it and
replied...
"So what!"
...and kept playing!

My question is, that do you agree that you can't "Win" Eq?  When you get to
lvl 60, which I am no where near, because I keep starting new characters, do
you feel like there is no more to do?  What do you think?
