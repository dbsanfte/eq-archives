Yes.

Yes.

No, though it appears that changes currently on Test will make the
Mobs not accept the weapons.

No.

Depends on your definition. If you come across a few dead bears in EC,
and the two minute limit has passed, they're free to anyone who wants
to loot them, even if the person who killed them is standing nearby
and decides to throw a fit over it. That's not ninja looting.

After a large scale fight, leaping in and looting a mob for some rare
item, while the group or groups who killed it (even if you were in
them) are working out who gets what, that's ninja looting, and it is
very frowned upon. Not only can it cause you problems with the GMs,
the people you screw over in doing this will remember it.

>5)Kill stealing

Again a definition issue, plus a severity issue as well. In general,
if you hit the mob first, it's yours to kill. Everyone accidentally
kill steals once in awhile. Game mechanics alone make it unavoidable.
If you KS from someone once, they may whine about it, but it's not
really a punishable offense. Do it multiple times, you can get
yourself in trouble.

A lot of people confuse kill stealing with camp stealing. The two are
not the same thing.
