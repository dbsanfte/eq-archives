File under 'Might be useful someday'

As with the chipped black marble mentioned above, this is rumoured to be
for some, as yet un-implemented quest. Unlike the gems, it isn't
tradeable so either find space for long term storage in your vault, or
destroy it.

On a similar note, I recently completed the quest for the Ice Forged
Shackles, mostly with stuff I came across by chance and had sitting in
my vault. Even though (a) I can't wear the shackles (b) I wouldn't, even
if I could, and (c) they're no-drop. Why? Because, that damn junk has
been sitting there for months. I really should check my quest junk more
often hehe
