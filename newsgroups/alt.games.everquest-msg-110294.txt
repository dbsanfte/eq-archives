Of course I don't "need" to port to or around Luclin. Porting is just one of
the abilities that attracted me to druid in the first place and it just
isn't available in Luclin. In all honesty, the addition of Lesser Succor has
mitigated this problem considerably.

The original point for the statement was that there were few Rangers who
could exploit a *new* ability making them far more useful on raids - that is
the new AA Archery abilities allowing them to deal massive damage from
outside AE range. I just wanted to illustrate that there were NO druids who
could even excercise base class abilities which make them useful (porting)
in Luclin.

Aye, at 59th level druids get a heal with decent HP recovery (880, I've been
told because of some non-cleric healing penalty), Nature's Touch. Most druid
s still use Chloroblast, however because of the shorter casting time. In my
opinion, making NT a Chloroblast upgrade - same mana/cast time with more HP
recovery - would be just dandy for druids and all they need. I don't want
CH. I don't want to be in a CH chain.

And this is the rub. I'm not 60 yet, and don't have PoTG. But I've been on
raids with 60 druids and that is NOT a buff that is used - by anyone that I
know of. I believe there are stacking issues with other buffs (Aegoism???).
This is my major issue with raiding, NO druid buffs are stackable with other
classes. They just fixed/nerfed the stackable CR/FR buff in the last patch.

On my wish list for druids would be to make some of our buffs stackable.
Stackable DS with Mages would help mages too. Stackable Regen with Shamies
would be awsome, but could be a game breaker - same with HP/AC buffs (like
PoTG) and cleric buffs.

Oh well, in any case - I couldn't agree with you more. Druids have their
place even in raids. Even as they are today. I enjoy raiding just to throw
in the stun DD's. EVAC is still useful (especially the new Lesser Succor),
and I have actually SAVED secondary tanks on raids even with the 524 pt
Superior Heal. And that is their weakest position - raids. In small groups
and soloing, Druids are still outstanding characters.
