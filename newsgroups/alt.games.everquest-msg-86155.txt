What are your stats now then?

There is a warrior creation guide here;
http://eq.castersrealm.com/creationguides/Warrior.asp

They suggest this;

Barbarian: Add 10 to Strength, 10 to Stamina, 5 to Dexterity.
Dark Elf: Add 25 to Strength.
Dwarf: Add 15 to Strength, 5 to Stamina, 5 to Agility
Gnome: Add 25 to Strength.
Half Elf: Add 25 to Strength.
Halfling: Add 25 to Strength.
Human: Add 25 to Strength.
Iksar:  Add 20 to Strength, 5 to Dexterity.
Ogre: Add 15 Dexterity, 10 Agility.
Troll: Add 10 to Strength, 10 to Dexterity, 5 to Agility.
Wood Elf: Add 25 to Strength.
Vah Shir:  Add 15 to Dexterity, 10 to Stamina.

I say it's bollocks...just make sure dex and agility are 75 min and then put
as much as you can into Stamina.
Dark Elf and Gnome you'll want to go for a 15/10 split favouring strenght,
they are weak races (DE especially so) and you'll want that strength so you
can carry armour and weapons later, or to put it another way, you'll be
sacrificing AC for strength so you can carry your equipment.

Strength does effect damage output, you will notice a drop off the high
numbers when you ditch you TBB for an FBSS but at the end a high Stamina is
really what you'll want, believe me...I know I need better than Crusty
Greaves but I am so going to miss that extra 16Stamina :�/

You've chosen a good race for a Warrior, you have a higher natural Dex then
many other races (including Dark Elves and Vah Shir, which is a surprising
choice by Verant IMO) Don't bother improving it, your skills will go up
anyway they're just slow now as fights tend to be quick. Concentrate on
Stamina and then Strength (personally 5/20 or 10/15 in favour of Stamina)

The good thing about playing a physically strong race for a Warrior/Tank is
these stats, you'll never see anyone trade AC to get their agility over 100
but weaker races will do that for stamina and even strength (or at least I
do)

CF
AC is King, Stamina is the Prince and Strength what is required so you can
have all that AC and still move :�)
