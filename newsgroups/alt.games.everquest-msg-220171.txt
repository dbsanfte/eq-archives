   Actually, that hasn't been true for a while.  Lenny 2.0 is 31 now, and for
the last couple of levels anything red to him (that he could handle) has been
blue or lt blue to me.

  And I didn't kill any kittens, or even pull them to be killed!

   I can't speak for or against Fatty Arbuckle's innocence, though.  I hope this
mess doesn't lead to my being blacklisted by Hollywood.
