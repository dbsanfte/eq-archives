The problem with Satelite ISP, like Direct PC. IS that the signal has
to go all the way up to the Sat. and back this causes lag as it is far
enough to put you a second or 2 behind people on a earth based
connection.   You can get high speeds for downloading, uploading but
it is not the best way to go for online gaming.  especially anything
real time.
