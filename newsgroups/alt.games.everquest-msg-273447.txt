Well, not a lot there for me, but ah well.

Does anyone know what levels the new Mistmoore and SplitPaw are for?

Being able to hide while levitating will be nice.
(My druid's Hide skill isn't great, but at least
it doesn't drop unpredictably like invis does.)

This will remove a minor frustration, but probably
won't draw people back to LDoNs much.  I do wonder
how many people will specify anything other than a
Collect?  I got into LDoNning after the initial craze,
and have never found a group interested in anything
but Kills or Collects, and often not even Kills.

Are the different types worth the same Adventure Points
at a given level, or are (say) Rescues worth more?
I can certainly see that Rescues/Assassinates would be
more difficult, since you have to reach the target,
whereas most Kill/Collects you can do without exploring
half the dungeon.


Didn't see anything else that affects my characters at
my current levels and play-style.
