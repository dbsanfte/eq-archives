Not to be snide but i cant help myself...did you even bother to red
the TITLE of my message?  About me peeing my pants cause of laughing?
was that not a clue for you?  I do not have win 95 and the fact that
you werent able to infer that from my title tells me you might just be
as dumb as my socks.

Also, disregarding the title...i never made a single quote of my own
in the post, other than to state the origin of the quote, everlor, and
to say that i was NOT gonna say a single word, just to sit back and
see what you all thoughrt.

Joolz...tell your mom to pull her head out of your daddy's ass...shes
getting too stupid from all the fumes in there.
