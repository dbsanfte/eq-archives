How many different spells and items that cast spells are there in the
game? How many possible stacking combinations are there? How long
would it take to test each and every combination when a change is made
or a spell is added? This is a perfect example of how hard it is to
deliver perfect code. In most cases stacking issues are an annoyance,
and are not "show stoppers". They are not really a bug so much as they
are incompatibilities between different code modules.

Define an "obvious" bug. You have to remember that code is nothing
more than a set of instructions. Large code bases like EQ break down
into code modules. When you make changes in one module, unintended and
unpredictable effects can occur in another. If a change is made in SK
melee code, then that change is tested. What if that change
unintentionally affects Bards or BeastLord pets? It would be wasteful
and much too time consuming to test every module every time a change
is made to one.

That is BS. No one is forced to play EQ. Your argument that people
can't stop playing if they are sick of bugs is ridiculous.

Name one product that is perfect and without flaws. Welcome to life.
You take the good with the bad. When it comes to entertainment (eg
computer games like EQ) you have a choice. Put up with the flaws or
quit. 400k+ see more good than bad.

Yes they are, but they are also human. EQ is a computer program
written by imperfect humans.  CTD bugs are ALWAYS a high priority. Why
do you think they rollout emergency patches whenever that type of bug
occurs. They don't wait until the next scheduled patch day, and most
of the time they are pathing around the clock. Shit happens. Another
valuable life lesson.

False premise. The game is not that buggy. Yes there are bugs, and yes
some have been around for years. Yet somehow thousands of people still
manage to log on and play.

Thank you. I take pride in my work. How about not changing a system
that works and has proven to be consistently profitable and market
leading? Since you care so much why don't you move full-time to the
test server, and help them test and debug the code?

Your comment is laughable and really not worthy of a response. The
depth and content in EQ is second to none.. The Kill/Loot/Sell aspect
of game mechanics is only a small facet of the total package. Get off
the exp grind, socialize, run a few quests, learn about the in-game
lore and smell the roses. If you think EQ is nothing more than
wack-o-mole then you have only yourself to blame. Much like real life,
you get out what you put in.

The Sims and Diablo do NOT provide constant updates, nor do they
provide 24/7 game play with literally thousands of other live players.
Compared to EQ their code bases are static and stagnant. You are
comparing apples to oranges.

That's life. The shame is people who can't see the fundamental truth
of that.
