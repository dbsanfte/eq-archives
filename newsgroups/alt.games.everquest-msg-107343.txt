It depends a lot on your server.   I was in an upper jail (necromancers)
group in sebilis, and EVERY FUCKING non-planar gem was "cleric candy", he
was casting group Aego every 2 hours, omg, 4 peris, plus maybe 2 or 3 single
target aego's an hour (due to dispels), so... around 200pp an hour being
really generous, he walked out of there after about 5 hours with AT LEAST 2
stacks of Fire opals, at least 6 sapphires, at least 10 rubies, at least 8
star rubies, and a couple of other gems ( you do the math, but he walked out
of there about 2k richer), he was nice enough to let us roll on the (only)
diamond though.  And he wasn't even that great a cleric, he cast Cheal on
the tank at half health, and he kept celestial healing the mage every time
that the mage even got hit (wow, 42 dmg, whee).  I guess the C3 was making
him lazy. God, Tarew Marr's Sebilis treats the stupidest clerics like
fucking royalty.

Yeah, this probably doesn't help you a lot, but at least I port clerics
free.
