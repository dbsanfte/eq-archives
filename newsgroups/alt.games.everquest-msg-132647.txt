Not at all.  If a child asks questions about someone with HIV, especially at
a young age, they will ask specific questions. These questions can be dealt
with with simple answers. Some examples:

Q: Why does Johnny have to take those pills?  A: He has a serious disease
and they help him.

Q:  Why do the teacher wear rubber gloves when they put a band-aid on
Johnny's cuts?  A: Johnny has a serious disease and sometimes the things
that cause his disease can leave his body in his blood.  If the teacher has
a cut and Johnny's blood gets into the teacher through her cut it might make
her sick. It's like when you sneeze on somebody when you have a cold it can
make you sick, so you don't sneeze onto other people.

Q: How did  Johnny get sick?  A: I don't really know for sure.  Johnny's
blood had to touch somebody else's blood that had the things in it that make
him sick.  How he got sick really doesn't matter.  What matters is that
Johnny is a great kid and he's your friend and it makes you both feel good
to be nice to each other.

As the child gets older and is able to formulate deeper questions, such as
"but how did Johnny's blood mix with somebody else's" then you answer those
questions.  Again you give the answers that a child is ready to hear.  For
each individual child this happens at a different point in time; it is based
on the child's abilities and not on an arbitrary age number.
