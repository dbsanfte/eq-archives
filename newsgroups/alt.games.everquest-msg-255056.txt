See, that's assuming a bit more clue on the tank's part than is 
necessarily warranted.  Especially at that level.  As a 35ish tank, I 
generally had a fairly vague idea how much your heals healed for and what 
that really meant in terms of how many mobs I pulled... And I'd expect the 
healer to have a better idea about that.  Just translate that to 'don't 
pull more than 2' for me, and we're all good. :)  You really don't want me 
thinking... 'hmm, three heals... that means three even con mobs, right?' 
:)

Yea, I really think that's ideal.
