    Tsk, tsk, tsk. Bad form, old chap. Learn on your own, not by imitating,
or you'll always be following and never leading.

    The "no chatter" is a good thing. The "chewing out" is a bad thing. More
of the former, ignore the latter.

    I can solo the light blues in Nadox no problem, so you should be able to
kill some stuff in CT solo no problem. Adds will be an issue for you in CT,
though. And so you know, all you really need to make the CT chain stuff is
Tae Eew Blood, which you can frequently find for sale in The Bazaar. In our
Bazaar, blood goes for 3 K each and the chain BP (requires 2 bloods) goes
for 20 K. 50% succes rate at max effective skill, so costs would be in the
12-13 K range, and you'd clear 7 K profit. Your server may vary.

    Everyone likes to hold out for the "dream loot". So if you send a tell
for less-than-ideal stuff, you'll have a very good chance at getting it.

    Agnarr has been killed by a single group. Guess how they did it. ;-)

    Congrats! There aren't many spell haste items out there for clerics, so
that was a nice acquisition.

    Yeah, and it looks very nifty, too. :-)

    When you hit the elemental planes, you'll encounter mobs that will rip
you apart because you're casting a much bigger heal than the other clerics,
at nearly the same speed. Remember I said this when it happens.

    Isn't "hey, guys, I know a good place to go!" one of the signs your
group is about to die?

    With DA, just about anyone that knows the way can cross Siren's Grotto.
Well, OK, they need a fast swimming skill, too.

    Especially considering, as you say later, that you're Ally to CoV.

    Sheesh, I wouldn't try that run. One flurry drake encounter and you're
going to be stunned too much to make it.

    Neat place. It's a lot bigger than the maps make it look.

    GAH!

> No necros online, so I decide to log.

    DOUBLE GAH! I can't sleep with a corpse on the ground. I just can't do
it. Any of the rogues in your guild with SoS (the improved Hide) could go in
and grab the corpse without any problems. They can actually go anywhere in
ToV without being seen.

    Reckless cleric! Then again, I'm King of the Conservative Clerics. It
was just recently that I walked along the path from Rivervale to High Pass
at night for the first time. Oh, no, green undead aggro! Whatever will I do?
