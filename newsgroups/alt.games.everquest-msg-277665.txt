That won't happen.  People will start the game, pick non-item-sale servers,
and then later decide they want to buy items.  They aren't going to move or
reroll on the item-sale servers.  They are going to want to buy on their
server, and they will.

I expect the market to expand on all servers, as this move by Sony basically
shoots down most of the arguments Sony made against sales before.  Before,
they could say IGE was bad and give various reasons such as harming the game
economy.  Now all they will be able to say is IGE is bad because Sony
doesn't get a cut and it is not as secure for the buyer.
