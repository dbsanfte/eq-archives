My Troll was able to do the Initiate Symbol quest after one letter
delivery and some Leatherfoot Raider Caps.  If what's-his-name won't
give you the Initiate Symbol quest kill a bunch of haffers (you need

think you turn in the caps to the same guy who gives you the Symbol
quest, pretty sure it was one-stop shopping.
