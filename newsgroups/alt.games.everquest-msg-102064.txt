The only way to share "evenly" is for everyone to be the same level.

The rules are:

If you are lower than the-highest-level-person-in-the-group * 2/3
(rounded down) -- or five levels, whichever is larger, you will
get *zero* experience.  (Another way of saying the same thing
is the highest person can't be more than 1.5 times your
level -- rounded up -- or five levels, again whichever is larger).

Exp splitting:  Add five to everyone's level and sum up these
numbers.  Call that "level total".  Your split of the experience
from each kill will be (your level + 5) / "level total".  Multiply
that by 100 if you want to express it as a percentage.
(Complication:  pets can take a piece of the exp, but in a
group with 3 or more people they aren't likely to unless
everyone's goofing off.)

Because of the way the "exp needed per level" is calculated (I
won't go into that here), everyone gets a reasonably fair share
of the experience split (unless you're low enough to get none
at all).  No one gets "hosed" even if they're the lowest level
person in the group, or the highest, or anywhere in between.

So don't worry about it.
