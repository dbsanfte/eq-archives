To all those people who have contacted me about a guild on AB, I am having a
few computer problems at home right now, so once I get those sorted I will
log in and arrange to meet up. I have been trying to upgrade my old PIII
450, got a new Thunderbird 1.4GHz and mobo, but wrecked my old PS because I
didn't realise it was only a 235W model, doh! Of course that had to happen
late Saturday when all the stores are closed, double doh! Hopefully I will
be back up and running in the next few days, see you then.
