It is not courtesy but attitude.

It's like taking a bit of 4 by 2 and smacking an old age pensioner over the
head to rob him of his $1.50 bus change. The socially acceptable thing to
say in a situation like this is the guttural droolings of a junkie. If you
start saying "terribly sorry old chap, watch the noggin, thank you very much
sir", well, then that is just being plain nasty...
