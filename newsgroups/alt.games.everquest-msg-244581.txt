}That aside, I assumed you knew that Gary Gygax - who is, in a way,
}indirectly responsible for the idea to put Monks into EQ - took the
}idea from David Carradine's monk character in the TV series "King Fu".

I don't personally know of anywhere that Gygax has claimed that.  And 
personally, I only saw a couple episodes of that show.  And found it 
difficult to follow, being that I was like 4.

We're definitely in agreement that that's how they ended up in EQ, though.
