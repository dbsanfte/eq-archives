My Wife and I starting playing Everquest about one month after the release
of Velious, and we had a great time.  We took a break and have just come
back recently.

I remember coming home from work late one night and watching her as a lvl 35
cleric heading to the Great Divide to hunt with a group of friends.

Just watching the fun that the group had getting there in the was greath -
there was the run from the gnome boat dock, past the Tower of Frozen
Shadows, across the huge bridge guarded by these awesome looking frost
giants - the whole party getting lost on the way through the Eastern
Wastes - and then the great views of the Waterfall entrance to Thrug.

Half of the fun we had in Everquest was just getting to new places - which
took effort - giving us the feeling of exploring and discovering.  But as
others have said - sure it's great the first time - well she picked up a
Dragon Tooth for the Great Divide ring - so the run was then optional for
her.

I will say that she really enjoyed - leading me all the way there as well -
to collect my tooth - so the journing can be fun more than once.

I guess I just feel a sense of loss - if new players wanted to go to Kael
Drakal - it's a click and a short run - they will never get the experience
of running through a vast snowing wasteland, with the feeling of being
hunted - and not knowing what you might run into next.

I guess I'm just suffering from a case of 'When I was a boy......'
