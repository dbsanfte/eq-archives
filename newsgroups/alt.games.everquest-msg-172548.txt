Nope.  

A clarification - bards have the first ever focus
items - instruments :-P

But, no, the focus items you're talking about don't
work for them.  (Note the classes on the mage summoned
ones - all the hybrids except bards)

Many a bard was VERY disappointed that the spell
haste focus didn't work for their songs.
