There are news routers which simply pass traffic, and there are 
the news servers to which readers connect. The latter definitely do
keep a list of active groups (or the NNTP LIST command can't work),
so something must be done with the newgroup control messages.

Traditionally, the default config for alt.*, in INN at least, was 
to automatically act on newgroups and mail delgroups to the admin. 
Abuse in the form of newgroup floods from Hipcrime et al made this 
a lot less attractive although I imagine there are more than a few 
servers which still do it.

The most common policy nowadays is probably to just drop any newgroup
in alt and wait for a reader to request it.

Myself, I have alt newgroups set up to mail, and I read them and
add the ones that include reasonable justification. There aren't
that many to deal with. But, no, I don't monitor alt.config.
