I Got blasted by about 5 different "a zombie guard" before I died on a run
through kithicor.
I was about lvl 45 bard, had selos+drum, and it was during the day!

Yep... during that time all the GM events were going on.
Thanks for the "gm event" in Kithicor, Verant. /rude

I havnt seen any undead during the day since.
