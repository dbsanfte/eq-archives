Well, Veshoon just hit fifty, so I think it will be a while.  IIRC, he still
needs to do the Firey Avenger part, and it's not like we're a large guild.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
