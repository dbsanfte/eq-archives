Sorry, Tweek, but I think that's a pretty poor piece of advice for someone first
showing up there.  I've spent a grand total of two sessions in Vellious and I
guess I already screwed up my faction there. (

Yeah, the snow cougars were doable for us at lvls 30-33 in our group with no
trouble. Just don't do what I did and go one island over and camp the gnolls.
There's apparently a faction hit for that which will disqualify you from doing
some neat quests.  Man, it looks like EVERYTHING in freaking Vellious revolves
around faction. As a troll, you'd think I'd be more sensitive to that.  *sigh*
  Also, in addition to the other suggestions, I went with a *full* group of
low/mid thirties friends over to GD right near the EW zone line and hunted the
frost giant scouts there. But bring a full group. They're tough.
