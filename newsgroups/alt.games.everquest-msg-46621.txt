Actually, Israel has been taking the fight to the terrorists for years, it
has not stopped the attacks.  It has resulted in a number of dead
terrorists, and/or suspected terrorists, and, of course, what is
euphemistically called collateral damage.  I'm not saying it's the wrong
thing to do, just that I would not expect it to necessarily have a huge
impact on terrorists in general.
