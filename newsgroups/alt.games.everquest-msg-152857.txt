I agree entirely... or almost so.  I did really enjoy the ledge in crushbone
where if you jumped down the mobs would run across the length, step
down, and run back to get to you, whereupon you could jump back
up and watch them do it again.  This wasn't a lock, like what you are
talking about, since they would eventually get to you if you didn't keep
moving, but it was a similar exploit nonetheless.

Other than that one spot, though, I'd be happy to see all such exploits
removed.  Mobs should be a threat that must be nuetralized or contained
by your actions, not by some error of the programmers.
