Hi folks,

I recently returned to EQ after about a 3 month absence, and it seems
that the world is gradually getting emptier.  Only POK and Bazaar have
appear to have any significant number of people in them at all.  Where
is everyone else?  My highest character is only L34 so I suppose
everyone could be higher level and hanging out in POP.  Or did
everyone just move to Stromm?

Anyone else noticed a similar trend on their server?
