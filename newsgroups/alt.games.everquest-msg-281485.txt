Hm,even with close to 300 AAs I always found something more useful
than to spent AA points on an ability I already posess,I have no
problems with "only" 8 spell slots or the mana cost of (En)snare.
That said,I was always under the impression that the AA snare works
like a spell snare according to aggro ?!

And as mentioned in another post in this thread Jolt is the way to
pull,maybe now with easy weapon setup switching enabled by
bandoliers using bow and a low damage/high range arrow is
another possibility,though I am already short of bandolier slots,
4 isnt enough,I would need about 8.
