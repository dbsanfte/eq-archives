I have read an unconfirmed rumor that the patcher now looks for the
default EQ:SoL directory. If you are using a different directory, you
will get this error message.

Try moving your EQ directory to:
C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest

Then login and see if the error goes away. That is what I am going to
do tonight.

Cheers
