You were told wrong.  I don't mind helping people once in awhile, but 
when I'm at a bubble of health, oom, and sitting next to the vendor 
inside the mill, the LAST thing I want is some twit running by me and 
dropping an angry mob in my lap.  And I stopped helping when I noticed 
that people who DID run in with an angry something would run off as soon 
as I jumped in to help.
