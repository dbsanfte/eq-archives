I'm saying its worse than that.  I bought the expansion, but I still can't use
the raid function to do those raids in the old zones.  Not only did are they
trying to use /raid as a lever to get you to buy the expansion, but frankly once
you get it its pretty much worthless except for in the PoP zones, because you'll
almost certainly get one person along who isn't PoP enabled yet.

This means not only are the people who can't afford or can't easily get or just
don't yet want to buy the expansion yet screwed, but so are those of us who DID
buy it but have friends who haven't.

Instead of me telling friends "you should get PoP just for the /raid function"
I'm telling people if they thought of doing that, they shouldn't bother, because
its not currently going to be useful unless they know a lot of other people with
PoP.  Might as well wait for the expansion to be cheaply available, unless you
want PoP for some other reason (like the PoK transport system, or the new trade
skills stuff, or the addition of tons of great hunting areas... which sadly seem
to drop no loot at all.)
