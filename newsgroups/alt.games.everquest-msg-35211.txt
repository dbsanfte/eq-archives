AHAH yeah I have got myself into very bad credit land much to my
chagrin. The odd thing is that then with these collection agencies
calling you and even reducing what you owe to less than 1/3, you also
get like 7,000 "you have been preapproved!" credit card forms. I turn
them in and of course it comes back "Oh you have bad credit so no!"
Well color me surprised, pre approved my fanny!

I think that makes your credit worse actually when they check when you
apply also, its kind of moot though now.
