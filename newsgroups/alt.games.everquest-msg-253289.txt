Moslty, but not quite completely, correct.  Your very first, and
most valuable, the spell "Stun" has a duration of 4 seconds.

Incorrect.

Stuns have zero effect on mob melee timers, they simply prevent any
attacks/casting/movement for their duration.  If you stick a stun to
a mob and that stun's duration is equal to or longer than the delay
until that mob's next attack the mob will attack the moment the stun
wears off (this applies to PC's as well, btw).  Likewise, if you
stick a stun to a meleeing mob and that stun's duration is equal to
or shorter than the delay until the mob's next attack, the mob's DPS
will be completely unaffected by that stun.

So, to use your example, if you have a mob attacking at 3 second
intervals and you stun it 6 seconds out of 24, you will on average
remove 4.5 seconds worth of attacks, or less than 19%.  If the mob
is slowed to an attack every 5 seconds the damage avoided is less
than 15%.  If, say, 1 in 5 stuns is resisted (against challenging
content resists are often much more common than that, even when you
are using stuns that have a negative resist adjust) your pseudo-slow
is further reduced (to less than 12% in the 15% case).
