>>> I have never done any kind of kiting and I'm not exactly sure how to go
about it, <<<

I've done my fair share of fear kiting, so I'll give you some tips:

snare then fear - last thing you want is to fear the mob, then have to run
after it because the mob ran out of your casting range.

after the mob is feared, then you can run behind it sticking it in the rump
with your swords (or axes or daggers or whatever you are using). When fear
wears off, back off to where you can cast fear again, wash, rinse, repeat.

This probably goes without saying, but have SoW on also (do you get SoW at
your level?) Will make it easier to recast when fear wears off.
