Well, you might live in cheapo land (read 'Country where people get
upset to pay 9 $ instead of 6$', read the US of A) .. maybe not. 
Anyway .. the game trilogiy *still* costs 60$, SoL costs 60$.
And shelling out 120$ just for a second account, you know .. it's
not really cool. That's one year on play costs. A year is quite
long to me.
