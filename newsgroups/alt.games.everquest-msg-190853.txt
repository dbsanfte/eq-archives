You walk up the road that goes out of the city to the north, follow it
past a T junction with a spur to the right (you carry on north) You will
reach a house at a kink in the road, where you head North north east.
Blackburrow is  a carved cave entrance in the style of a gnolls head. Run 
in there and the zone is at the end of the tunnel. There are gnoll guards
that will pssibly be too much at 5.

lvl 5 is possibly just a little low for inside too. First the mobs on the
way may be a bit much - not always but cumulatively the wanderers may get
you. Also just as you zone you may get into trouble easily. If you go at
lvl 5 Id suggest a group, that should work.

When playing rugby, its not the winning that counts, but the taking apart
