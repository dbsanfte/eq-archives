Ooh...you've triggered one of my major beefs with EQ!

I think this is one of the big reasons I'm enjoying taking a long break from
EQ and playing NWN.  NWN uses a very close approximation to 3rd Edition D&D
rules, and so when I need to decide something like whether I should wear my
belt that gives +4 strength or my belt that gives +2 to various saves, I can
actually think about what I expect to be fighting, and estimate which will
help me most.

I think the reason so many game companies keep the rules secret is that they
are worried that there are holes in the design...some magic combination of
class and race stats and equipment that will make a character way too
powerful, and that people will discover this, and everyone will end up
playing essentially the same character, so I'll put up with it on older
games, like EQ, but I think I'll hold newer games to a higher standard.
