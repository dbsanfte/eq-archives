The classics are Sebelis, Chardok, and Velketors.  All indoor zones,
fairly intense action, "need" cleric/chanter/warrior/porter as your group
core according to most people.

If you want something more casual, though, try my favorite
vacation spot, Cobalt Scar.  Get melee's the key from Skyshrine and
you can bind them nearby in case you happen not to be about to
res em.  Everyone else can bind in the zone itself if you like, I
reccomend the ramp down to the beach as it never seems to have
any wanderers or to get trained.

The Wyverns, Drakes, and Haunted Sea Chests (why aren't those
chests "undead?") do not give faction hits, the first two are on
COV faction, so if you've worked on that they won't attack you
until you pull em.  People also hunt the Othmir, but if you don't,
you'll be able to med and fight happily on the beach unless there's
a spill of Bulthar.

Wyverns, you can solo, if you have TBoots or better, by
immobilize and nuke tactics.  Pull em down to the beach so
you don't get adds... turns out you can nuke em from down
below, so you don't have to be an experienced cliff diver
like I was for several levels.  Bad thing is they are popular
with the quad kiting crowd, so at busy times you will have
a hard time finding em to kill when you are ready.

Drakes are harder, I think at 50 you can solo them, but I didnt'
do so seriously till 51, better buffs.   At any rate, the trick is to
Fear em, like Spectres they run as though snared, with Tboots
you can keep up in order to nuke em.  Better is with a partner,
so you can chain stun em while your partner kills.  You cannot
afford to let them breathe, thats a 500dd cold AOE which also
serves to strip up to four buffs off of each target in the area.
Unlike the Wyverns, though, they are -rarely- taken, Druids
and Wizards aren't good at keeping em from casting, nor are
they very good at taking a pounding.

Haunted Sea Chests are good with a partner or two, more HP and
mean, but more campable than the wyverns, the usual one is
near the otter vendors, pops on a six minute clock, most groups
find they can pull a wyvern or drake in between chests and still
stay good on mana.

Bulthar are the next step up, if your group is making mincemeat
out of the chests, you can give em a try; they aren't exactly easy,
but they are better exp than chests, too.  You will be taking faction
hits, but I can't think of any reason you'd want good Bulthar
faction.  Biggest concern here is that you take care not to train
the other people hunting on the beach.

People also hunt the sirens, but I have little experience at that.
They are enchanter type casters, which would be fine if you
could get em alone, fear kiting or chain stunning while your
buddy kills em... but it seems the times I've tried it we tend to
get four at a time.  Get a real group (the chanter/warrior/cleric
thing I was talking about earlier) and they should be simple
to handle.

I've also seen some fish running around in the water, but I don't
know much about them... oh, and there's a dragon on occaision,
usually within about ten minutes you'll see an uberguild pop up
to take him out.

Have fun... and work on your tan while you are down on the beach.
