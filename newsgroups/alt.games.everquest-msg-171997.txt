Then why don't you just say "wizard"? I don't call my skillet a
"skillie" or my toaster a "toastie". As I said, it makes sense to me
that people shorten some names, or even use a different term that
offers some benefit as in the "tank" example.

By being normal, I would be trying nothing. Besides, I wouldn't call
it being normal as much as being correct and saying what I mean
without trying to impress.

They may never know me or care to as you say, but what they do want is
for me and anyone else they come into contact with to be impressed by
their l33t-ness.
