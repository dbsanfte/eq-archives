Awhile back I had problems with my computer shutting down after I got into
the EQ game world.  This was before the SoL expansion and I can't recall
what I did to correct it.

Many months later EQ runs fine, but now I am having a problem while playing
Red Faction.  During the game play, at random times my computer decides to
reboot or just freeze including sound.

Anyone know a way to correct this, happens about twice an hour!

Thanks, Danny
