Well I didn't.  The first Bow I had came from a Blackburrow Gnoll as
did ALL my arrows.  Absolutely no way could I afford to fletch my own
at the time.

Power-fletched my way from 103 (where I stalled pre Tolans Bracer
circa 2000) to 200 just the other day just in case I might need it at
some point but unless I go farming boatloads of Acrylia *AND* spend
some AA points it's never going any higher.
