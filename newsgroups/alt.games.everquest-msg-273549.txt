Long slow trips across the countryside are great when you are starting
out.  Once you know the way it's much better to be able to zip places
than to have to travel for a couple of hours just to meet your party
and go kill stuff.

Niteblindness sucked big time.  Even with a light source I had trouble
seeing things.   I basically spent half the game blind.  What really
drove me nuts was when it would start "raining" at 6am, and the rain
was almost as bad at one point as darkness.  It pretty much made the
game unplayable.

I used to complain to my wife and she shrugged it off until one time
she came past my office and looked at my screen and said something
about it being black, and I told her "yeah, that's what it looks like
at nite" and she couldn't believe that I put up with that.  She was a
lot more sympathetic after that :)

Instanced zones mean you can still chat with your friends in your
guild, but you don't have to deal with KS'ing, camping, fights over
whose spawn something is, etc.

One of THE problems with EQ was that it was completely static.  The
same innkeeper complaining about the same rat problem 5 years later.
Change is part of life.

I suppose the boats really were immersive... they probably represented
pretty well being in some desolate part of the world where you might
sit on the docks for weeks, wondering when the boat would come.  Of
course, the immersion kind of disappeared when a voice out of the sky
announced that the zone was being reset YET AGAIN because the
ridiculous boats were hung up.

Again, long slow trips are great when you are starting out and
discovering places.  When you know how to get to a place and the trip
itself is a boring 30 minute run, it's not fun, it's a waste of time.
Some method where you have to walk the first time but after that have
gateways / gryphons whatever to speed up the process is ideal.
