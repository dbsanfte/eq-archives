Jessie your country along with Canada owes a great deal to the concept of
Common law. This is the law which guarantees free speech in Austrailia. The
Americans seem to find ( my opinion here )that any law that isn't written
down so that the lawyers can fight over it and make scads of money a
difficult concept at best. couple this with their conviction that their way
is the ONLY way possible and you get what you see here. I've stayed out of
this as I feel that beating a dead horse or trying to change someones mind
who will not so much as listen is a pointless endevour & my time is better
spent elsewhere.

This seems to be rather regional in the states. Yes in the bible belt you'd
better hold appropriate views if you want to be elected or else. However
this can be ignored by some I gather Bill Clinton was from the bible belt
area & look at the way he behaved!
