Well... if people asked before inspecting I very seriously doubt there will
be smart ass comments about inspecting without permission... <Cough>

If I walk up to you and I try to shake your hand you don't have to stick
your hand out... and I have to respect that. I have to ask for permission to
shake your hand... if someone walked up to me and shook mine without my
acceptance I would consider them rude and either stick my foot up their ass
or just not consort with them.

See how an act of friendship or an act that is not harmful can be
misinterpreted?
