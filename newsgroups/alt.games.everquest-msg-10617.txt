      What are the tactics or strategy for recovering your corpse, from a
location, that is occupied by the high level aggressive mobs,  that killed
you and are camped around your body?       Is there any solo way do it?

      I (level 36) was running across the Northern edge of West Karna and at
about -1000 east-west   I was ambushed and killed by three characters who
are not marked on any map.   I have read about the same thing happening at
the same exact location to others.  It seems these mobs do not wander but
stay at the same spot waiting to ambush the unwary.    So I can not wait for
them to wander away or be pulled or be killed by other players.

The attack was so sudden and devastating I am sure my corpse is right there
in there midst.

     So what do you do in this circumstance?

        Thanks
