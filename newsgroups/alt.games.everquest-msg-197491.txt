Rumble, I respect your opinion, and your right to have an opinion,
but you've spurred this hobby horse into sawdust and then some.
What Davian and others are pointing out here is that the level of
stress resulting from nature of the difficulty involved in these
flagging trials is way beyond anything their guilds have had to
endure at any other point of the game.  You have not yet provided
the tiniest bit of support for your assertion that surviving this
unprecedented level of stress is the measure of a good guild.

Face it man, the emperor has no clothes.  You claim to be listening,
but I sure don't see much sign of it in your posts (and I speak as
one who has argued similarly unsupported positions at great length
in the past, I've walked the path you're on more than once).  Your
insistence that the guilds that collapsed under this stress were
somehow "bad" is not made true by your claim that it is so.  There
was no reason for the players forming and joining those guilds to
anticipate anything like the PoP trials.

Trials is a neat idea, I like it lot as an abstract notion.  But it's
quite a leap from liking an idea to defending an implementation.  And
when you admit that you are arguing from hearsay and supposition and
then respond with "I'm not hearing indisputable evidence.".  Well,
there is irony, and then there is irony.
