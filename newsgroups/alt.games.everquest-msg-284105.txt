You refuse to even consider how you have acted.  You only post in
defense of yourself, so what is the point in arguing with you since you
know you are right.  Your rude welcome didn't come until you developed
an attitude.  But by all means, act as you will.  Expect more people to
treat you badly...

To act as if people told you that clerics are useless is garbage.

It is easier to argue against yourself, isn't it?  Why bother
addressing other people's arguments when you can just make up their
points?  That way you should have no problem proving them wrong...
