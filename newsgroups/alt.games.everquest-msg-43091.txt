Jason,
    I have a 47 Rogue and maxed his lockpicking skill at 180 --'Sat at home
for 2 hours doing it, so I'm quite sure... keep me honest, Rogues--, anyway,
180 couldn't pick that lock.  My skill wasn't high enough.
   So Jbrone, fyi, go higher level on your Rogue, make sure he/she maxed out
and don't be afraid to cold-call if you have to.  If you have no Rogue then
your Reaver raid is all for naught.

   Does anyone know exactly what the skill must be?

-Grim
