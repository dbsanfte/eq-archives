Twinking has many meanings to many ppl.

The basic view is giving giving items to someone that could not otherwise
get it.

This could be as simple as giving a newbie warrior a full set of bronze and
some jewelry. or as extream as giving a character a full set of Rare High
End Items.

Different ppl have different idea's on how good or bad twinking is. Most ppl
I know twink their alt characters to some extent or another. For the simple
reason that most ppl I know like playing everquest, but do NOT want to live
a life of selling bat wings, and rat teeth to live off of for the first 10
levels when they could just get some equipment EASILY by using thier 'Higher
level characters to get loot

I have a 51 enchanter on Tarrew Marr. I've earned everything on my chanter
:) when I create another character I want to use that time spent to make my
game time more fun. Killing 2000 critters in a newbie zone to be able to
afford my spells is not what I want to do heh :) been there done that bought
the T-Shirt... just my humble opinion
