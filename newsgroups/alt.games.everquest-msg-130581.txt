I've heard DSL is less laggy, but have never heard a first hand report.

DSL isn't "less-laggy", the internet itself has lag and that will not be
overcome anytime soon.  DSL and cable modem are both very fast, but DSL has
less 'latency'.  It's generally better for gaming than cable broadband
(though I will not be giving up my cable, hehe), unless you happen to live
quite away from the switch.  I'm not sure how most DSL providers dole out
their connections, but I believe the maximum physical distance from the
switch is 18,000 feet.  The DSL provider in my area (Verizon) won't hook you
up if you are beyond 14,000.  The further away from the switch, the more the
signal is degraded.

And this, Sir, is the epitome of Truth.  Bless You...
