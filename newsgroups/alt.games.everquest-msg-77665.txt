However, wizards have two big advantages over mages when it comes to
nuking:

1. Wizards get ice, fire, and magic-based nukes, so we can match the
nuke to the mob's weaknesses.

2. Wizards get spells that are harder to resist.  As a 52 wizard, I've
hit level 65 mobs for full damage.  I don't think mages will do that.
