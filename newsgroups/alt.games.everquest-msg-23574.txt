Safest route to follow:

Iceclad

Raft to dune island.  Run across to dock, Icebreaker to Igloo island.
Go into the water, follow the shoreline to your left.  You will hit
a line of ice floes to the next island, follow that, then stay on the
shoreline
again in the water. This is the Tower of Frozen Shadow island.
Again you'll hit ice floes, at the Snowfang Gnolls camp.  Follow
that line to the Portal Island.  Following that shoreline till the
cliffs
get quite high, you'll have to go up to get to the Dragon Bridge.
Giants
at the base, but short aggro range, and the bridge is Huge, just keep
your distance.  Go up the bridge and you'll zone somewhere in the
middle.

Eastern Wastes
Go a little further along the bridge, then turn right and leap off the
side... don't go far or you'll hit land.  Stay in the water, follow the
shore to your left till you hit the zone wall.  Now climb up the cliff,
hug the zone wall, keep your eyes peeled, both for the rare
mob this far over, and for the ravine to GD.  Don't fall in, especially
not on SOW, its a 10,000 point fall.  Turn right and follow the
ravine to zone.

Great Divide
The zone to city is at near zero/zero, behind the waterfall.  There is
no
extremely safe way to get there, unfortunately, unless you are a
worshipper of Ralloz Zek.  The two mobs in your way are Frost Giants
and Drakkal Dire Wolves.  If you have SOW up you can outrun em,
if you have Invis up you can walk right by em... if you have niether
you need to excercise a high degree of caution, take a wide berth
around them all, and hope one doesnt' pop on you.

Using this course, I've taken level 3 characters to Thurgadin, without
SOW or Invis.  Course it helps to know at that level that death costs
no exp... do the trip naked, all your stuff in the bank, and all a death

costs you is time.  The Snow Bunnies in Eastern Wastes are pretty
good exp at 3rd and 4th level, by the way.

Make sure you get your GD fang out of the dragon circle there, by the
way.  While Iceclad is a death trap to port in to, Great Divide is far
less risky, as well as much closer to Thurgadin.
