If you had been following the thread you responded to you would have
known that the point about eq paralleling medieval times had been
originally raised to attempt to support the argument that switchblade
should be an ok name since they existed in medieval times.  The point
that I make is that whether switchblades did or did not exist in
medieval times is irrelevant since eq is not a copy of medieval times.
 In eq the year is 3172.  There may be similarities, but there are
also enough differences that you cannot say that if something existed
then then it should also exist in eq.
