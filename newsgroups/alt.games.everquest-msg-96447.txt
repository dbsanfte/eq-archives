    For some of these changes, like the lower level res spells, I imagine
they a big obstacle. But I don't see the raid chat channel as something that
was stopped by "The Vision". More likely this is the first chance in a while
the programmers have had to implement new features without an expansion
looming over them. I'm hoping this "no expansion" period lasts a good, long
time so a lot of the gripes (broken quests, yet-to-be implemented features
like the Bazaar) can be cleaned up. After seeing some of the solutions
coming from the caster balancing process and how they're being presented to
us, I have a lot of faith that they can get things right if they have time
to do it.
