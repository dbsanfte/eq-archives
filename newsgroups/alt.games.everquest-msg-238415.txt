Congratulations!

When I surf the loot tables and drool, I sometimes forget how much
hard work is involved in some of that uber-loot.  Spending the last
week farming flame-dancers to get Earthen Gloves of Wisdom for a
friend reminded me of that fact.  Don't know if I could hack raiding.

So congrats again, and thanks for the insights to the upper game.  I
hope the Time BP isn't the end of your stories.  Been kinda interested
in your experiences in GoD as well.
