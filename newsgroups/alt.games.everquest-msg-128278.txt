> First, who can group and get exp?

As far as my EQ-education has taught me, for every member of a group to get
xp share the biggest span of levels within the group need to be within 150%
of lowest groupmember, or within 5 lvls if below lvl 10.

> Second, how is exp divided.

Any mob has a xp value set at spawn. this xp is then divided among the group
who gets the highest amount of damage on the mob.
Highest damage means ofcourse that if 2 groups attack same mob and group1
gets in 51% of the mobs total hitpoints in damage and group2 overkills by
dealing final blows of 52% of the mobs total HP group 2 gets the kill..
Back to XP distribution, if the group is within previously noted lvl range
and say consists of 2 lvl 25's they take 50% each of the xp, if they are 2
lvl 25's and a lvl 20 they divide XP according to how many lvl-shares they
have, as 25+25+20=70 they each get 25 parts and 20 parts each of the 70
available.
So lets say Mob_01 gives 700XP player_01 (lvl 25) gets 250xp, player_02 also
250xp and player_03 (lvl 20) gets 200xp.
How this works when the mob is green to the highest lvl players in group i
have yet not seen any explanation to, but i have noticed that it seems that
the xp is divided according to above among those group members that the mob
should give xp to, and again ofcourse if group is within lvl restrictions,
else the low lvls will get none of the xp.

Groupbonus is, if i am not incorrectly informed applied on top of spawned xp
and at death of mob.
And is 5% per group member counted from no.2, so effectively maxes at 20%
for a full group of 6 players.

That should be explained in this table i think:
