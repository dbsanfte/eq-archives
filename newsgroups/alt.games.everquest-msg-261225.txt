I was having the same problem, updated video drivers to the newest crap
ATI catalyst... and then tuned stuff for performance instead of quality
(ie turned off anti-aliasing and a couple other bells and whistles) and
no more problem.. hell.. things are running alot smoother now..
No more slideshow in PoK.. But of course this was after 4 hours
of EQ telling me I didn't have a 3D device (do a search on the EQlives
knowledge base for no 3d device.. that's the closest I've seen them come
to telling you you're screwed.. get over it.. we can't help you) Also if you
haven't done it already.. try turning down ENV particles... that's where I
got the real boost of FPS from.
