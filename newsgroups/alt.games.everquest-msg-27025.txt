*sigh*
Over the past... however long kunark has been out, theyve (Verant) been
saying the leaves arent slowing it down
its the top of the tree or some crap like that, the old world didnt used to
draw them, like in dark forests, or else it was just a tall pyramids with
some 2d leaves crossin in the middle of the tree
One of the other computers in my house is like a P2/350 128 ram, I think
133mhz, and the video card is ATI... I think 8 mb, and I can go full clip in
FV with it with very little frame loss. I dont know how, but it works. Funny
thing is, all the other programs suck and are slow with it.
