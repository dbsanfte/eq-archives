Does anyone know what is the story for NK and WK?  There was green rain and
mist and people got sick from being in the area.  Not really sick, but
messages saying you feel nauseous and etc.  Someone had a battle with
swarmlings which were blue beetles not seen in NK, and a swarmling mother.
This was on Saryrn, but I heard it's also on other servers.  I spent a few
hours in NK trying to find some storyline but couldn't find anything else
besides some rabid griffawns.  Killed one but only got a feather.  One guard
told me to report to qeynos about sightings of lord grimrot but I think
that's another quest.
