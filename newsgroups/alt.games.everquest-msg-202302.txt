That can get annoying if you have different setups for different characters 
/ accounts since the key mapping changes for all users on that PC. My 
brother did this on his account and when ever I tried to play my characters 
on his box they would sitdown whenever I tried to move.

A better way of doing it (IMHO) is to add the /doability line into your 
commonly used macros, e.g. attack, assist, spellbook, /shout Train to zone 
or whatever. I never had a problem maxing my caster's sense hedding by just 
adding the /doability to my sit macro.
