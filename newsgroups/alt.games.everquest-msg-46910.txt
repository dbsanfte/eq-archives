Same problem affected me. I figured it out through painful trial and 
error. The protected recycle bin appears to periodically "archive" 
deleted files and this locks the game up momentarily. It's major pain.

Another potential problem is if you use DHCP but your computer can't 
find the DHCP server after its old address expires. It will periodically 
poll the server and this also locks the machine up for a small while.
