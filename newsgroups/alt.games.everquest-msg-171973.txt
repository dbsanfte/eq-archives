In RL I have one that is both of the above, depending on who it comes
from.  I have red hair, and have been called "Red" by many people for
as long as I can remember.  When someone I like calls me "Red" I respond
just as though they called my given name.  OTOH, I've completely ignored
people I don't like until they used my given name.  One particularly
dense person got EXTREMELY pissed off because I was acting like he wasn't
even there, much less talking to me.  He never did figure it out.
