I don't know how Best Buy does it, but I sold electronics years ago and
was constantly threatened by management that I'd be fired if I didn't
sell a certain percentage of extended warranties with the products.  I'd
sell $3,000 in merchandise in a week and get yelled at while a woman in
another store would sell $300 worth and get all kinds of praise because
she sold each product with an extended warranty.  What a joke!

Even so, I never pushed the warranties on people.  I'd simply mention
they were available and let the people decide if they wanted them. 
You'd be surprised how many people actually ask to buy them anyway.  I
have, however, almost walked out of a store (Staples for one) because
they acted like they wouldn't sell me the product if I didn't take the
extended warranty.  Some salespeople really do push them and won't take
"no" for an answer.  I have to assume that they are under the same type
of pressure from management that I was to sell them.
