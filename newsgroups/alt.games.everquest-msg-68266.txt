  I've had this happen to me a couple times after logging in after a
new patch.  I've also heard of it happening for a few other people.
The last time it happened to me, after I camped, I rebooted, and when
I went back in to EQ everything seemed slightly slower.  The next time
I logged in, everything was normal.

  So hopefully the problem will correct itself as it did for me.
