Yes there is.  You can mez up to level 73 I believe.  The problem is
that the runes needed for your level 69 and 70 spells can only be
looted off the corpse.  They only drop in higher end zones.  In most
cases this means your critical spells such as single-cast cleric HP
buffs, ranger attack buffs, chanter haste, etc are all dropped in lower
level zones and tradeable.  Meanwhile the group versions and the best
damage dealing spells are harder to obtain.  You can still cast
Conviction for example (cleric HP buff) but the group verison requires
level 70 spell rune drops.  The level 70 group version is nice but you
can get by without it.

Some classes are a little more screwed here than others though.  In
some cases their more important, class-defining spells are in the
nodrop category.

Still, level 69 runes are not that uncommon.  Heck if a chanter wanted
one s/he could go sit at any of several camps in RSS (high-end OoW
zone) for a few hours and sooner or later a group will have one
rotting.

Enchanters, by the way, are very important in DoD.  Many of the best
single-group missions (with VERY nice loot available to non-raiders)
are highly difficult or impossible to complete without some good crowd
control.  They are also in high demand in the highest-level DoN
missions, and can be a welcome life-saver in some OoW zones.  They are
still one of only 3 classes with a very nice slow, and only 2 of those
can debuff magic.  They have the best haste buffs and believe it or
not, even though people can buy clarity potions, they prefer to get
c3/c6 still.

As for your comment about gear, it will take work but you can get some
reasonable gear just doing DoN missions.  The stuff sold at the DoN
camps (much in the manner od LDONs only better) usually has a bit over
100HP at the highest end, with augment slots that can add another 50 or
55 HP or other stats/effects.  The weapons have ratios like 17/20 and
16/18.  There is an axe a warrior can buy that procs anger III.  Each
of these weapons can be augmented to improve the ratio, or add another
DD/hatred proc.  With some work you are going to be in
elemental-quality gear from DoN missions.  Then you can move on to DoD
missions, which give out even better gear, on par with PoTime drops.
(200 HP, shielding or spell shielding, improved dodge, FT 2 or 3,
clicky mana regen buffs, etc)

Heck I didn't even mention DoN cultural gear.  (Very nice AC and
reasonable HP/Mana for non-raiders) The options for upgrades for a
non-raider are definitely better than they were when OoW first came out.
