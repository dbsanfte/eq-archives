Oh please.. get ahold of yourself bro.. its something real world
engineers have known about for a long time. Heck.. even your real
estate agent could inform you with 3 words.. Location, Location,
Location. We've expanded this country through the expansion of
transportation. For all the people coming out on covered wagons in a
3-month trip... the west really wasn't settled and populated until the
trans-continental railroad and subsequent add-ons were built. Why is
it, that suddenly Norrath would be different. A designer builds zones
in order for people to use them, but if he doesn't provide an
efficient way of getting there, few people go, the zone becomes
largely unused.

>A zone's popularity is directly porportional to the  *benefit* in going there.

In order for a zone's popularity to be large.. the *benefit* had
better be exponentially better. Something you can't get somewhere
closer.

Yup.

I'd prefer they just make the access easier. You shouldn't have to
depend on other classes for travel, especially when it may take you
2-3 times to get your body back. Granted, it was a lot more obscene in
say.. the Velious days. Imagine dying in Kael and being bound in East
Freeport. You find a druid/wizard or that is one long ass CR.

Which would pull the solo'rs... try convincing a group to go that far
out.. especially when other zones are closer and the CR's aren't that
bad. Hell.. Qinimi i think it was... the one off Natimbi I grouped in
a bit when GoD first came out... we ended up getting a random drop
Mana Preservation III hand item with decent stats that even some of
the 65's in group considered an upgrade from what they currently had.
Did it cause Qinimi all of a sudden to become a hotbed for groups?
Nope. Hell.. xp in sewer zones were as good as earth, plus you have
the possibility of spell drops.. did people enmass suddenly flock to
them to level in? No.. because you needed a great group for them and
getting there was a bitch and a half... especially if on a CR.

Here is the thing.. SoE heard your woes.. they created an expansion in
GoD that wasn't 'dumbed down'... was designed for the high-end.. and
all they've been is slagged for it.. even by the high-level players
that it was designed for.

IMO, Its pretty sad when Afterlife loses to EQ and has an expansion
beat them. And it did. They can make whatever excuse they want for
switching over to WoW.. but the fact of the matter is they lost enough
people from GoD to be a viable guild.. and ran to WoW with whatever
they had left.

Yeah.. and the fact a lot of people like going to what they know.

If its out in BFE.. it had better be a *huge* difference. I used to
make jokes about the xp in Nadox.

I think those are reasonable.

Something about this just screams.. wrong. Haven't put my finger on it
yet.

It just seems a little too.. artificial. Like you are trying too hard

I really like the dynamic ZEM idea.
