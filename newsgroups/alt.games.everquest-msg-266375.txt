I have been there and this is what we did.  Get powder that is
invisable except to UV light, put it on a $5 bill, put money in a mt
tv dinner box with a note that says somithing like, honey we out of tv
dinners so here is some money to get something at work.  now the theif
steals the mony, the powder is on his hands, he picks up his time card
to clock out leave resadue on card, you run uv light on time cards and
you now know who it is.  we had a supervisor in on this and the guy
got fired, stealing is not allowed at my company.
