From what you've said, it sounds like you group most of the time, when you
are grinding XP.  I believe that a good group gets better XP per person than
a single-kiting solo Wizard, which is what I was for those levels, and I was
taking about 8-10 hours /played per level.  So. upper limit for you, is 90
hours /played.  90 hours in 3 months is easy.

What guild?  I'm curious because we play on the same server, so I'm
wondering if I've heard of them.
