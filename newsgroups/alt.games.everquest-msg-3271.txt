Did my dumb thing for the week the other day.

I was in WC and heard an auction for the item I've been wanting for ages.
The price was good so I give a tell that I want it, but needed to make a
bank run.  Being a troll, Neriak was the closest safe bank for me and
involved a run through a couple zones to get my money.  The guy says he
would wait at the druid ring for me and to hurry up cuz he wants to level
tonight.

I go tearing off (couldn't get a SOW) and make it to the bank all the while
updating the guy on my progress.  Find out I'm a little short in the
account, so I go off and sell my primary weapon to make up the difference to
a merchant (no time to sell to another PC, and this weapon was like 3 times
better).

I run all the way back huffing and puffing (again no SOW) and find the guy
at the druid ring.  I go to inv to get the money and see that all I'm
carrying is the money from the weapon sale.  DOH!!!  I looked at my bank
account but didn't transfer the money when I saw it was short (no idea why).
Then when I sold, I thought I had all the money on me.

Guy is pretty mad... but manages to get a chuckle out of it.  I can't
convince him to wait around for another run.. and he was going like 5 zones
away to group up.  Oh well.... Now I have no weapon at all and spent the
next hour looking to buy a new one.
