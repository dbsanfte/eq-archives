Yes, yes - this is my expectation too.

This will be my first Naggy lead, though I'm a pretty experienced RL at this
point. Even with mostly peeps I know the RL's life and get pretty
frustrating. With Naggy and Vox, it's worse because very few guilds can
field the right mix of classes in the proper level range because of the cap
(by the time one comes in, someone else has gone out of the level range in
question). This means that almost any Naggy/Vox raid is going to be at least
partially a pickup raid. In tonights case, it's going to be 100% pickup, but
this is my dedication to getting my scales the old fashion way (yes, I'm
stubborn).

We'll see how it goes. It's entirely possible that someone will have waxed
him already today and he won't even be up (I hope not).

Vox should be a tad easier - she is almost never raided anymore on Povar, so
you can actually plan a raid around her. I've actually lead one on her, but
to refer back to your frustration point, I had to cancel that one because I
had *just* enough peeps, and a few folks didn't listen (imagine that) and
fell into the pits before we got in. The a monk goes sneaking and FD'ing to
try and get them, but he aggroes again when he stands up and we get all the
IG's in there unexpectedly. By the time we got everything cleaned up, we had
people that had RL commitments and had to go, so we didn't have enough peeps
anymore. /sigh.

Next time with vox, I'm either going to have enough folks to just leave
those who don't listen in the pits until it's over, or I'll have a few
coffins with me and have those that don't die down there suicide so we can
summon them back up (that or have a Mage with CoH).

I'll let you know tomorrow how bloody my fists are (from the broken glass in
the monitor)....
