And I think you're grossly mischaracterizing his position, to the
point of being groundlessly insulting.

There are points systems where newcomers still have a chance
at loot, albeit less of a chance than the longtime raiders.

Which is as it should be, in my opinion.

And on a related note, a friend of mine is one of the top Clerics
on our server, and your uber-guild often asks him to come along
on your raids to help your guild pull off a battle.  Each time,
he asks, "will I have a chance at any loot"?  "Well, no, just
guild members will get loot", is the answer.  His reply is always
some variation of, "well then why the fuck should *I* come help
*you* guys succeed on *your* raid at *your* request if I'm not 
going to get any consideration for it??"

This shows the core "use 'em and screw 'em" attitude of too many
raiding guilds.  And yours is hardly the only one which tries
to pull this stunt on him.
