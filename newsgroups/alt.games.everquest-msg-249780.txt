Oh, yeah I love that idea. Next time I'm playing Halo and I'm down a
few kills, I'll click the little upgrade button and spend $5 to be
invulnerable for about 5 minutes. That'll show those n3wbz overthere,
how a real man can play the game. 

And when I'm playing Counter Strike, I'll drop in a few extra dollars
so I can buy the best equipment from the equipment selection screen.
It'll make that whole beating the counter-terrorists thing a whole lot
easier.

Honestly, we all know the whole black market thing is going on, but
that's exactly what it should be, a black market. Once the people
running the game become the purveyors of money for items it cheapens
the whole experience. Right now you at least have the moral high road,
if you don't use services as IGE and such.

It's cheating, and some people have no problem with cheating. Some
people want to make cheating legal. Some people just want to make
money off the whole endeavor.

Why not just package a 65th level character in when you buy the game?

What if SoE offered an upgrade to the client that allowed you to go
AFK while your character happily farmed items for you?

Of course it's a slightly largish leap to move from Player to Player
trades for money, to an upgrade to the client that allows AFK farming,
but I won't take back the speculation.

I think the end result of SoE offering to allow players to transfer
items for money, is that SoE will then be selling items for money.

Call me an alarmist and a knee-jerker, but the simple fact is that SoE
sees this money sitting out there waiting to be scooped up, and like
any corporation, has an immense push to do so from profit loving share
holders. It's just like many corporations, they only see the short
term gain, because that's all their share holders are interested in.
Because of course, if the game starts to fail, and the stock price
starts to go down, all they do is sell. Long term profitability is not
in vogue any more, with instant stock transactions you can play it
rough and still have time to sell before your entire savings goes down
the tubes.
