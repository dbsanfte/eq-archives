*SIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGHHHHH*
I presume this is the standard way of replying, to assume an air of
superiority.

You seem to think that because a word is a noun, that it cannot be used as
an adjective. You used a dictionary, but it was the wrong tool. What you
really needed was a basic grasp of grammar.


Nouns used as Adjectives:
Sometimes nouns can be used as adjectives to define or describe another
noun.


Examples:
     the porch light
     a house fly

Perhaps the University of Calgary just can't learn grammar or are just
trolling, and yes, it is time for you to give up.
