I figured you were probably joking, Annie.  In the three years or so I've
been hanging around a.g.e., you've always impressed me as a pretty dang
level headed person.  It was probably one of those cases where if I could've
read your face or heard the inflection in your voice it would've made all
the difference in the world.

Earlier in the thread I mentioned a posting on an AO webboard entitled "Chat
Log From the Sinking of the Titanic".  Now, I've been a card-carrying member
of the Titanic Historical Society since years before Ballard found the
wreck, and I thought it was an interesting take on it (with some degree of
humor involved, for example, the Californian was portrayed as being afk and
the Virginia was having lag issues), but didn't find it particularly
offensive ... the original author had quite obviously done their homework.
I inadvertantly created a small ruckus on a guild board several weeks ago by
converting the AO terminology into EQ terminology and posting it.  Didn't
mean to do it, but it happened.  It denegrated to a private message hoedown
between myself and another member.  We got it worked out, but it was a lot
of effort that could've possibly been avoided if they could've seen my face
instead of reading something and putting their own spin on it.

Aren't people funny critters sometimes? ;-)
