}Isn't there a difference between coming to a

}observable, and seemingly subject to a variety of
}natural laws, and something that is none of these.

If we assume a creator, then He is observable.  Conclusions can be reached 
about him by viewing him through the instrument of his creation.  In the 
same way, we can make conclusions about stars or leptons based on how we 
observe them through instruments like telescopes and particle 
accelerators.

}I was disagreeing with your statement that;
}"...Occam's Razor demands...". It doesn't demand
}anything, it is merely a reminder of where the
}best results usually are.

Way, way too many people get that wrong, in my opinion. :)

}>I think demolish is correct.  If Life requires a creator due
}>solely to its complexity, surely a creator capable of
}>creating life must fall under the same arguement. 
}The creator cannot have have come about by chance,
}it is too unlikely.
}I do not see how logic dictates the conclusion that;
}The creator must have been created.

When logic fails, resort to poetry!

So theologists observe a god
Has larger gods to which to pray,
And these have larger still to smite 'em,
And so proceed ad infinitum."

With apologies to Jonathan Swift for the miserable attempt at a parody. :)
