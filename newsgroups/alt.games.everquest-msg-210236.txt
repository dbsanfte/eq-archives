Well, pre-PoP, in general Dungeons got bigger ZEM's than
open zones.  There was a point a while back (the exact
timing escapes me) when SOE made a big push to get people
under 30 into dungeons.  This was when they expanded the
cleric rezzes down to 14, and gave Paladins earlier rezzes.
They also introduced low level evacs and summon corpse.
Finally, they boosted the ZEM on under 30 dungeons (CB and
Befallen come in this category apparently).  I think there
are 3 reasons PC sees so much traffic and the others don't:
First, location;  PC is simply the easiest of the zones to
get to, considering you can bind 10 seconds away.  Second
is word of mouth.  Early on in SoL PC was near abandoned,
I leveled my kitty BL in there without anyone sharing the
zone with me for large blocks of time, then the word got
out about the xp there, and it became flooded.  Last is
the fast spawn timer in PC.  It's so fast that just 5 or
6 shiknar spawn was enough to keep a cleric I was PL'ing
fighting constantly.  I want to say 7minutes on those.
