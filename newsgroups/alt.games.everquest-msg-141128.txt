Very recently on Xev a trend has started where two or more clerics
that are willing to wait out the spawn will have their guilds combine
forces when he does pop to avoid getting overpowered by the "brute
force" method.  On the most recent Rage kill, there were over 60
people in the zone within 5 minutes, all cooperating for the mutual
benefit of the clerics in their guilds.
