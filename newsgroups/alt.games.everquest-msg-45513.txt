I was passing thu South Karana with my mage, when waaay off in the
distance I saw the shadow of a griffon.  I thought this was wierd
because I didn't think there were griffs in SK. Anyways, I took a
little venture over to check it out just as Quillamane(!) killed a
druid who was attempting to kite him. 

Quillamane then preceded to shread the south spire group, a shaman
dropped, then as he was beating on a ranger, he sent me a tell and
asked me to help. So I did. And I unloaded on old Quill. 

To my suprise, I got the kill! He dropped the cloak, I told them what
dropped, and they said grats and essentially let me loot it. I was
giddy!  Replaced my gossimer shoulders, and now I'm perma leved.

Everyone says how easy the epic is after get Quill's cloak.  I
wouldn't think this is the hardest part of the epic, I'm thinking the
hardest part would be Isle 7 in Plane of Air. But I'm only 31 so
dunno.

A mage with epic, is truely an uber mage.
