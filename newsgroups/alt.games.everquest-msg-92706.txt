    Thank you, Sui. Glad I wasn't the only one to notice it.

    Because you did. Telling someone "you must have a crap reputation" over
and over tends to do that.

    Re-read the thread - I felt the way I felt about Sleeper's long before
you asked why I was guilded.

    As is mine.

    I base my opinions on what I see. On my server, the Sleeper was awakened
out of a desire to deny others something. On Stormhammer, TR wants to do the
same. On many of the servers that did it, denying others the chance to farm
Primal was reason number one to do it. /shrug. And which group is broader -
the 55 plus players that woke the Sleeper, or all the other 55 plus players
combined (and welcome to that club, BTW)?

    If you think that there's a winner and loser in an exchange of opinions
then you lost any chance you ever had to gain something in the first place.

    They also sleep with goats. I have proof.

    If I told you that we'd CotH'ed people into NToV from HoT to loot stuff
like PAL/SK only shields, or the bard neck, because they'd otherwise rot
you'd really hate us. :-)
