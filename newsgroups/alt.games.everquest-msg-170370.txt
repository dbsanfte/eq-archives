Not that I'll put *anything* past Sony's designers by this point, but
adding a new window to separate out songs and normal buffs, and not
making them exclusive of each other would be assenine to the extreme. I
mean, we've already got a window that shows 15 buffs just fine. If
you're not going to allow a total of 15 buffs *plus* "x" number of
songs, why bother with a new window to clutter up my screen?

But.... as I said, I wouldn't put anything past them.
