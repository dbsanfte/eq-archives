Yep, you get faction for trying any spell on the mob, or for healing
people the mob is beating on (sometimes) or for taking a swing at
the mob.  Or sometimes just for getting in close range of the mob.

Unfortunately, the "sometimes" cases aren't all that reliable when
there's a large crowd beating on the target, so doing something
directly to the mob is the best plan.

You don't need to go to the arena to do this, though, what you
need to count coup on are Storm Giants, instead of the Frost
Giants you see in GD.  There are some of these in WL, and certainly
in easier to get to places in Kael Drakkar than the arena.  Since
those outer giants are substantially lower level, you may even find
yourself capable of making a real contribution to an exp group...
and picking up exp and loot while you farm faction.
