My Paladin was the beneficiary of one of you.

Running along, see a lower level having a really tough time being
swarmed by Klaknaks in Misty. I drop a couple heals, aggro a few with
flash of light and tank them until the newbie can get around to them
(only level 10 at the time, but a Klaknak was no worry) Once it was
all done, I sit to regain Mana. Someone anonymous de-invises right
next to me and hands me 100pp, a nice axe, and some +wis jewelry. The
only statement: I am leaving the game, and wish to reward actions like
that, Norrath needs more of it.

I was very appreciative, and have always been helpful when I can. I
don't play the Paladin much, but my primary Druid is seldom full mana
when travelling, with SoW and Skin hotkeyed for drive-by buffing in
newbie zones. I figure I ain't using the mana when travelling, and as
long as I don't bring myself below half, I ain't endangering myself.
With half mana, I can escape anything I could get away from full mana.
