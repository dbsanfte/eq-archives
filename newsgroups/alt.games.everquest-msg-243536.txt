I arrived too late to really understand the rules but halflings were diving
headfirst off a building in rivervale. I decided to occupy my time by
throwing shurikens at the POD and found out he'd kill me roughly the same
time with the following exceptions:

1) shot him from thieves guild; it seemed to confuse him; a bit. LOADING...

2) ran into river! This worked really well. Of course, the piranhas were a
bit hard for my lv 1 ranger to handle so i jumped out eventually. He was
waiting on the riverbank. LOADING...
