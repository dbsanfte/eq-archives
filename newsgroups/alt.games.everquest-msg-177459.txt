Well my bard is rapidly blowing through levels (at the cost of melee
skills I must admit) but I am actually in need of some good gear.  I'd
love a place to hunt in Velious where there is a potential for some good
cash drops either in the way of plat/gems/items etc. which I can sell.

My bard is now 35, anyone have any advice where I could solo for some
decent dough? The giants in great divide seem to drop anywhere from 1 to
4 pp, and while I can rip those up at a fair pace, it will still take me
eons to accumulate 1k or so of plat.

Thx gang from my somewhat typical question (I think second only to
cihys)
