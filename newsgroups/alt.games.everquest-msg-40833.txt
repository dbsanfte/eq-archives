You can take bread from the Centaurs to Innkeeper Gub in Feerott enough to get
your faction up to do the quest.  Raises Clurg and guards and I think merchants.

My druid did that and In wolf form I am amaible to clurg and the guards. 
Warrior guild and Shaman guild still scream for my blood, but you don't have to
go near either of those.  I am glares threateningly to the guards not in wolf
form, so i could still get faction up more if I want.  I did the stein quest for
my necro cause i couldn't find anyone selling one.    I have done the stein
quest a few other times, but basically just for friends, i think i sold two
others, I didnt' really want to farm the quest for cash and drive the price down
any more.
