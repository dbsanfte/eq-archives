I'm a LV9 Iksar Monk with 110 pp total. I saw 2 pieces of WUs armor on a
merchant, one was the shirt for 48pp, and the other was the shoulder pads
for I think about half that much. Would this be a good investment? Should I
buy those, or should I auction to buy WUs armor or should I buy cured silk
at this level and buy WUs armor later?  When buying either of the two, how
much should I expect to pay (pp/ac)?  Anybody know a good place on the
Solsik Ro server near Cabalis (or where a LV9 Monk can get to without much
trouble) that I could get cured silk or WUs armor from (auction)? I'm
currently fighting in Ill Omen and all I see are auctions, but nobody
responds to my asking for armor.  Is there a better zone in Kunark (like EC
is to the old world)?
