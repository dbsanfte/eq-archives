If you spend time in Dulak's harbor eventually you can get the boat charm,
or the brotherhood charm, or the map charm, or the other one just by people
killing there and announcing that something has dropped in X location.  In
the 2 hours i spent there working on my bard quest, i had 3 of the 4 medals
of service drop in the shark tavern myself.
