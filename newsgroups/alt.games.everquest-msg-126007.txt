    Ground spawn, Skyfire? Sounds like the quest for those nifty shoulders
whose name I forget. The turn-in fellow is in Western Wastes - you need a
piece of coral off Phinigel, some other rock off Yael, the ground spawn, and
one more piece off someone in Western Wastes IIRC. The shoulders are
all/all, 100 HPs, lots of STR and something like 15 FR/CR. Everyone wants
them, which is why Yael lives for about ten minutes when he pops (kinda like
Drusella and the cords quest in Chardok).

    Or I could be completely off. ;-)
