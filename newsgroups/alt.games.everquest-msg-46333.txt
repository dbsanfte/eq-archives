I personally rather not waste my time nuking junk in ToV.  It causes
excessive downtime.  I perfer more efficient use of my mana.

No shit.
However in a pinch, they can handle AoE damage healing without
problems.  The key here is you have to keep a rogue above 2 bubble of
health.  As long as they stay above 2 bubbles of health, they stay
alive since the mob will super aggro on any melee whose health drops
below 2 bubbles.

Druids will NEVER be primary healer for any tank tanking a ToV mob.  I
probably have the highest mana pool of any druid on my server and I
can garantee you, I will OOM LONG before any drake/glimmer/wurm goes
down.  That's with a level 60 warrior using defensive with 1600+ AC.
