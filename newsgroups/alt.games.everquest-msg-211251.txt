I've been trying to get the Harmony spell working and I'm not having much
success.  As I understand it, if there is a group of mobs that I want to
pull from, I Harmony my first target and then pull him and the others aren't
supposed to aggro, right?

Most of the time, when I try it, nothing happens.  Once in a while, the
target will be covered in little spell lights and if I try to pull him, I
always get adds.

Now I'm guessing that when nothing happens, it means that the Harmony didn't
affect the other mobs.  And when I get the spell lights, then the Harmony
has affected at least one of the other mobs.  But not necessarily all which
is why I get adds.

If I'm right, why aren't the others affected?  Or why not all of the others?
And what can I do to increase my chances of success?

Thanks in advance.

Clayton
