In alt.games.everquest, thou, Lokari  (lokari@_nospam_lokari.net), hast wrytted...

Heh, I think they may have added some "funny" loading messages.  I saw
one that said something like "Sanding down Wood Elves <something> 30%
<something> <something>" (the message went by too quickly to for me to
see).

The loading times in general are *much* longer, especially if you are
loading all the new Luclin models.  Zoning one time I had waited so long
I was reaching for the reset switch before I finally popped through.  Ugh.

Yes, you can see much further now in some places (it feels like).

This is my problem (I just posted about).  My framerate is seriously
many times worse when in the same field of view of 6 or so characters.
Just abysmal, like 1 or 2 frames a sec, possibly worse.

I also crashed out twice, which hadn't happened in a long time for me
previously. 

My first impressions: everything is very pretty, but also unplayable at
this point because of my framerate problems.  Not to mention bard songs
seem to have been broken (don't know the details).


feh,
Micah
