I tried this suggestion, but my face still changes every time I zone.  I
then tried putting it the way it should be, making sure my character is
saved, and then logging off.  When I came back in, my face was once again
different.  This is extremely frustrating - makes it kind of hard to role
play a character the way you want when you're not happy with the way he
looks.

Has anyone else encountered this?
