}You 100% sure about that?

Dunno about him, but I'm 99% sure he doesn't see invis.  I tested it when 
I was dubious to him.  Suddenly I was indiff.  But I'll alow 1% odds I 
screwed it up somehow. :)

}I've had said wuoshi does... but even if hes one of the exceptions, its
}always safer to assume any dragon sees invis :)

Sounds like a good plan. :)
