A tri plated hammer has a right click effect of shield of the magi (15 mr i
think , will not stack if you are already an int caster)

One of the card quests in pom gives an item with a right click resist buff
of 50 mr . (does not stack with priest-chanter line)

There are some foods that will give up to a +5 or so to mr if you have them
as your to be eaten food.

Im sure there are several more that I do not know about . (crown from
somewhere clicks a resist magic the ~25 mr one but cant remember where i saw
it )
