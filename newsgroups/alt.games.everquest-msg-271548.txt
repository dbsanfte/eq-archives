OK, but I differ with you in that I think he'll manage.

Ha! ha! OK, you really nailed me there. And when I start playing some of 
my alts I'm sure I will be learning a lot of new things.

This is a problem sometimes I agree. I have seen that a lot at wos camps 
after wipes and it is annoying. I don't think I've run into it so much 
before as there and maybe at some of the Planes zones too. Of course, in 
my case Virtue isn't a problem, but now some of them aren't satisfied 
with that and want Conviction, which is a stupid reason to keep a group 
waiting around when Virtue is available. But yeah, KEI is the worst 
crack of all no question for the groups I find myself in.

I thought I was going to be cast in with the gimps there for a minute! 
lol... I have to confess, this is the first time I've really thought 
about this in terms of someone else's perspective who is not a cleric. 
And I bet it is fun to play with what you have and make the most of it 
when it comes to healing without a cleric. I want to play a druid and a 
shaman in the future and besides their other talents, it would be very 
interesting to find myself needing to be responsible for healing without 
the power I now take for granted with my cleric.

Well, perhaps I will be finding out about this more the hard way when I 
start spending serious time with my alts, which is coming up soon.

I know there are incompetent players in this, or any game for that 
matter, for a good number of different reasons. But in going from 1 to 
65 with one character I just never found incompetent players to be so 
rampant among the population (on Stromm anyway) as to be a major problem 
that impacted the game so substantially as to spoil my fun on any kind 
of regular basis. Sure, I've seen then too and there have been times I 
have died because of them. But at least for me, it has not been a 
problem near often enough to upset me or make me come to the conclusion 
that the game's design is horribly broken such that it is not 
consistently fun for me to play.

But if this stuff really does affect you often and is causing you to be 
very unhappy with EQ1, then maybe you would really like EQ2 where this 
kind of buffing is simply not an issue as it cannot be done at all ever. 
Personally I don't think I will like that in EQ2. But I have yet to play 
the game so I cannot really give an informed opinion about what it 
really means to solo gameplay. It certainly does completely remove some 
of the issues you were talking about above so maybe it is a good thing 
overall. You know if the classes could solo effectively without the 
buffs I guess it would be very good overall. Unfortunately though, from 
what I've been reading, soloing is not good in EQ2. But that's another 
topic for another thread.
