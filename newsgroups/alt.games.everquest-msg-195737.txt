Here's the difference though, Rumble.  Since PoP was built to create
something for folks to do post-60, the encounters in PoP were most likely
designed with the assumption that the casters involved would be under the
influence of KEI.

As such, if casters are going into those type of encounters without KEI, the
encounter is now unbalanced in the mob's favor.
