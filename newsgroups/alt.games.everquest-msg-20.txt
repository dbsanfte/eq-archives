: What items are those?

Likely among them is the Mrylokar Breastplate (6.5 s cast time as opposed to
the 15 seconds Cobalt Breasplate).  Possibly also the Donal's Breastplate,
as some uber guilds were chain using them to keep a tank alive in fights
against some TOUGH Velious mobs.

Some of the Velious mobs redefine "tough."  Gone is the limit of 32k hit
points.  Some have been reported at just over 1 million, and there are mobs
left, as of yet, unengaged.

Amen, I hope those tracking enhancements come soon.
