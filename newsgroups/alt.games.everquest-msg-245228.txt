I'm surprised it took them this long, I honestly expected this from day 1 of
LoY.  Mobs that hit harder and have a lot more hitpoints then LGuk mobs but
give the same XP?  Why bother, unless you're farming for quest items?

Having said that, I did find Gulf of Gunthak great for soloing Marrtuk,
since the undead mobs didn't cast and didn't run when low on hitpoints,
which more than made up for their extra hitpoints and damage output.  But
the other zones... easy to get adds, mobs that dot you fiercely, take
forever to kill, and offer the same XP as a dar ghoul knight?  It's just not
worth the risk.

Now that they're going to raise the ZEM, it might revitalize these zones,
which so far have been SOE's biggest flop to date.  The rest of LoY was
fine - drogmors, extra bank space, new utility spells, armor dyes, etc.  The
zones themselves were a big disappointment.
