Proceed at your own risk!
The ownders of the web site are below.
If this looks legit to you go ahead, but remember lots of advertising
agencies troll newsgroups looking for contact information.  If they had
had a detailed profile to go along with an e-mail then they just hit
the jackpot.  I've never seen a game company use a third party company to do a 
public beta test for them.  To me this seem extrodinarily suspicious, espicially 
since there is absolutely no info on the game.
