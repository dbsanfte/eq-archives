My wife plays on a laptop sometimes, but turns down some of the graphics
options.  She does so on her desktop too, though, so it may be just habit
rather than performance.

http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support/ts_system_requirements.jsp
gives Sony's recommendation for requirements.  Finding a high-end graphics
card will be the trick, but there are a number of laptops available with
good DX9 video cards.
