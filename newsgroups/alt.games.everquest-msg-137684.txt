Anyone have any idea why they included this feature?
It's neat to roam around viewing your various Alts...but for what
purpose?

I'm wondering if there will be plans to expand this interface to
include swapping Money/Equipment amongst your various Characters.

Also, and Office mate mentioned that you can now chat directly with
characters on different servers...pretty cool feature, I wonder if
it's to gradual move to World Hopping Someday.  Up until now (as far
as I know)...World Servers were completely separate from each other.

Thanks for reading!
