Just confirming it can't be the screen though.

Try this...

1. Defrag your HDD.
2. Update your video drivers to the latest build.

Not having the swap file being used is a concern also. Check that the
swap file settings are set to 'let windows manage the swap file' and
see how it goes after that change.

Then retest.
