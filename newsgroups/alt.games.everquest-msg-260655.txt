I don't feel that what you've described here and what Foxeye and Ben have 
mentioned elsewhere are necessarily mutually exclusive. It sounds like 
the best of both worlds, actually - the depth and atmosphere of a rich 
fantasy environment which provides immersion through a system of effort-
based rewards, while at the same time offering a means of coming together 
to achieve a common goal under extreme conditions.

Honestly, it sounds an awful lot like what we have now, warts and all. ;)
