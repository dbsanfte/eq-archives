Speaking on warrior's perspective--

What is more preferrable, having the MT switch targets when MOBs go after
healers, or letting the enchanter mezz them?

>> If everyone is beating on one MOB and a rouge MOB goes after the healers
(low amount of HP) -yes- I switch over. But instead of attacking, I taunt it
so it gets off and goes after me (more HP) then the mezzer can mez.

If you had 12+ spiders you need to fire that puller...nothing could have
saved you.

>>No matter who pulls, if there was 12+ spiders on my butt I'll go down
fighting, rather than bring it to group.  Rather have one rezz, than 6 of
them.

For good reason.  Why did the MT think that it was HIS job to save the
cleric?  At MOST he should have had some other taunting class turn around
and just TAUNT the critter beating on the cleric until the enchanter took
care of the problem.

>>Whats the warriors job? To take the beating of the group.  Again, we have
the most HP (most of the time) I'd rather have a MOB on a tank than any
other class.  If a MOB was on my cleric -again,yes- I would go over and
TAUNT him off without attacking. Or 'maybe' attack him enough that his anger
turns twords me and THEN I would stop attacking him and let mezzer mez. Then
I'll return to original MOB and help again.

We are alot smarter than most of you guys take us for.
Sorry one of us makes the rest look bad.
