Group with people.  If you like them, take note of their guildtag,
and put them on your friends list.  Every time you log in do a 
/who all friends and you'll see these people online.  Try to group
with them more, chances are there will be others from their guild
in your group.  If you like those folks too, then ask them how you
go about applying to the guild.  In most cases you get directed to 
a guild web page.

No, you must be logged in.

No, as long as you are in trader mode you don't consume food
(my bazaar mule still has 17 of her newbie food/drink and she's
a vah shir :-P)
