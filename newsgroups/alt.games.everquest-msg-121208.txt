  Pretty much correct.  "Combine" was the language spoken by the citizens of
the Combine Empire, the civilization that disappeared from Norrath long ago.
They didn't create the spires... the Shissar did, but the Shissar used them
to escape from the plague of Greenmist before the Combine civilization rose.
It was a long time before anybody else figured out how to use them, but the
wizards of the Combine Empire were the first.  The Combine civilization then
fell (the remnants of the empire took up roots on Luclin though), and
everyone forgot where the spires came from, so it was presumed that the
Combine Empire, who were the last to make serious use of them, were
responsible for their construction.

  But the "Combine" language has been in since the official release of
EverQuest, to my knowledge.  I think Vah Shir characters start with some
proficiency in the Combine language.
