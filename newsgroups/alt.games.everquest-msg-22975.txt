One of these days I'm gonna put together a a.g.e FAQ and add this question
to it.  Here goes:

There's no way of doing what you're describing in a hotkey.  When you see
someone repeating a very long /auction message, what they are doing is
manual typing it in the first time, then using shift-up_arrow to scroll
through the list of commands they've typed in recently and resending the
auction.  (Likewise, the auction message can be modified by using
shift-left_arrow to move the cursor back into the message, then
deleting/adding characters as needed.)

There's only so many words you can put into a hot key message, so you need
to pick and choose carefully.
