My mistake, I mean "for that trade skill" not "class"

There are nine different items, each of which has a "trivials at 250" step
to it, as I understand it.  This doesn't mean, though, that you need a
250 skill, success rates aren't terrible at even a 150 skill, and in
some cases the gifts are the cheapest way to get more skill ups, since
fails don't eat the expensive parts.
