Threats are generally just that.  Idiots think a lot of things are
petitionable when they aren't.

Yeah, this could have been petitioned, but there was no point.  There aren't
enough GM's to go around at the moment.  Response times seem bad enough that
by the time they got around to dealing with this the idiots would have
gotten bored and left on thier own. (1)



(1) I was stuck in a wall for over 45 minutes a few days ago, unable to
/rewind.  And the petition wasn't what got me out, a friend logged on her
druid and manged to group and evac me.    A stuck player is probably a
higher priority... so I'm guessing an hour or two before they got around to
idiots blocking the bank.  Heh.  Probably the GM's are all tied up with
explaining to morons, like the one you mentioned, that they can't petition
for things like that.
