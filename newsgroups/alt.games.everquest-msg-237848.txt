Oooooh, harsh.  MORE MORE!
Of course, you have some valid points.  I didn't post here to have people
tell me I was well-behaved, that what I did was right.  I did hope someone
out there would see it from my viewpoint.
And no, while I do lose my temper from time to time, as all people do on
occasion, I am not psychotic IRL, nor am I drunk.

And I'll place my responses on the top, bottom, or hell in the middle of the
quoted material!
