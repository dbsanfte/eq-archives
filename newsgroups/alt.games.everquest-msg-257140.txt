Honestly, it doesnï¿½t seem to be a big problem here. You don't see
people "slumming" here very often. I can't say for sure as I have only
recently joined a casual raiding guild, but I haven't heard anyone
complaining of "uber" guilds farming raid encounters or nameds below
their level.

I get the impression that even though the gear is droppable, most of
the raid encounters in Luclin, Velious, and Kunark, are up almost
constantly.

Since most stuff is droppable, people make more money selling that
stuff that you practically have beat people to loot on other servers.
Or better yet, you can sell or pass down the equipment you have
upgraded. The lack of NO DROP seems to have exactly the opposite
effect that every one assumes it should have. Just doing what you
normally do, seems to generate enough cash for people who raid.

Imagine how much cash you would make if you could have just sold all
that NO DROP armor you've had to destroy when you get an upgrade...
No, I could be wrong, but from what I've seen farming in general does
not seem to be a problem here. I can kill spiders in NK for silk for
hours without competition, when I farm rockhoppers in DSP (is it still
farming if you get exp from them?) I sometimes have the cave to
myself, or at most have to share it with one or two other people. This
is of course small time compared to raid encounters, but it seems to
be the case all the way up the chain. Only raid encounters that see
heavy use (as far as I know) are the ones from PoP and GoD.
