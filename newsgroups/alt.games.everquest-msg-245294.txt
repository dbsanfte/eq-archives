My Pally is only 49 now,admittedly pretty heavy twinked with his
190ish Dex,he carries WMBS too,but I find him using nearly exclusive
the Hammer of Silent Screams,because of this wonderful 180 point heal-
proc,and the price for the hammer is unbeleivable low,around
600p,saves money for a *real* haste item like Enchanted Sash of
Wonder,Soulscream belt or even a Cloak of Crystalline waters.
