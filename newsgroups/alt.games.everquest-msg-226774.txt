Split does split as evenly if it can, however, it doesn't break down
coin denominations. If there are 43 pp and 4 members in the group,
/split 43 is going to yield 10 to everyone but you, who will be
receiving 13. This is why ML then sell and split at the end tends to
be favored. It gets much closer to an even split. The splitter will
come out MUCH farther ahead with just autosplitting coins.
