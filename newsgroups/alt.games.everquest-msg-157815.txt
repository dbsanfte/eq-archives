Thanks for clearing that up, quite a good explanation

Wurmy is 25/40(Main ONly) Centi is 12/15.  Quite Decent IMHO as I can get
some wicked crits with the wurmy (120's+)  So it seems the general
consensus is I should scrap the wurmy and get a faster weapon.  The Centi
LS is looking quite nice right now so perhaps Ill see if I can get one of
those.  Then ill be wielding a Centi LS(24/27) in main and Centi SS(12/25)
in offhand.  That should produce some nice damage me thinks. :)
