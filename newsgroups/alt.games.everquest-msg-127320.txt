Having just hit 18, and made a fair few plat from selling various bits and
bobs, I've noticed I don't have either an item in my Shoulder or Waist slot,
and my Ear slots both have poor items (1 has alligator tooth earring - +5hp,
the other a +2 Agi earing). Can someone recommend some items I might like to
aquire either by cash or questing. I'd like to keep total cost under 100pp
if at all possible. I was thinking perhaps an INT stat increase since I only
have INT of 95. My WIS is 122. CHA is only stat that is still at base level.
My character is an 18 Half-Elf Druid. Thought now was a good time especially
to upgrade as I'm in Gfay which is something of an auctioning hotbed :)

TIA
