I have a posted here before and got great infomation.  I have a 36th bard
that I am getting bored with.  Is this natrual with the higher you get?  I
have been soloing in OT and getting bored with that and when I group my exp
is very VERY slow.  What to do with that...I am looking for a good way to
make some plat, the bazaar is holding right now a SS BP for 40k and the
greeves for 6500.  I would love to get my hands on them, but I need to get a
cash flow.  HELP ME PLEASE.  So I quess what I am asking is a good place to
group and then to get plat.

Thank you all for helping me with this.

Eric
