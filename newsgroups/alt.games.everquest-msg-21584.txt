Heh, /say is risky, because I have no real idea how far a radius it 
carries to, and who might be standing on the other side of that wall... I 
frequently don't know my groupmates well enough, and even our guild has 
been recruiting a bit lately.  I pretty much restrain myself to when I'm 
grouped with guildmates I know well, or we're alone in the zone.

}Nope, filter goes back to day one. 

Yeah, the bit about parents groups strikes me as the weightier argument, 
anyway.

}And since it filters everthing even adkuetrice... 

Dang.  Why?  I can't even find a substring of that I'd have thought might 
offend.

Gosh, Stan, such language, from you... :)

One of the main problems I find with it all is that the words that 
actually _do_ offend me tend not to be recognized as offensive by others.  
For example, "whore".  I've known enough people of that profession to feel 
that the term "sex worker" has much more merit to it.  And using "gay" 
with the intention of it being an insult bothers me rather a lot.  And 
it's amazing to me how many people seem not to even realize how blatantly 
offensive "faggot" is.  I just quietly hope to myself that they're British 
and mean a cigarette.
