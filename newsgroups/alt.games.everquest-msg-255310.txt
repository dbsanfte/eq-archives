Sure.  After all, some halfling found the One ring as a groundspawn at the 
bottom of a river.  And some other halfling won it in a riddle contest.  
Why shouldn't there be more than one way to obtain it?

But then, effect: Invisibility (worn) isn't really all -that- uber, is it?
Especially since it's also got that Drain Endurance effect.
