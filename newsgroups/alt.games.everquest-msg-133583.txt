Both weapons are essentially (from a druids point of view) exactly the same,
ratio of 1:5.

The "Your will is not sufficient.." message means that the weapon has an
extra effect, in this case the velium weapon randomly casts a spell that
damages your enemy for 10hp (not sure about this), but this extra effect
will only start to work when you reach a certain level, which is 20 I think
for velium weapons.
