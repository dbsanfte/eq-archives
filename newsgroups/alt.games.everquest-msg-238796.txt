Don't worry about guilds yet. They are like clubs. How would you know
which ones are good? you need to meet the ACTUAL people who are in the
guilds themselves and see if you like grouping or playing with them.

Conversations are intiated by Hail-ing the NPCs. That is, you first
TARGET the NPC and then you either hit "H" or manually type out Hail.
The NPC (IF they have something to say) will respond to you.

Every class has a set of armor you can quest for at early levels. The
NPCs that will provide the quests for you are generally located right
near your Guildmaster. Go to this website here: www.allakhazam.com

Bookmark it as it will be your best friend.

This is how it works:

You say, "Hail Merchant".
Merchants says, "Ah greetings, young knight. I am in a bit of a bind.
Oh how I wish there were someone here who could [help] me!"
You say, "I can help you."

Notice the brackets around help? It's a keyword but you need to phrase
it so that it makes sense to the person. Like if I were to say that
above line to ask for help and you just respond with "Help.". That
won't make sense to me.

Another example.

You say, "Hail Vendor"
Vendor says, "Greetings, young one. I sell [armor], [weapons] and the
like."
You say, "What armor?"
Vendor says, "I have plate, chain, and steel."

Notice there are a few brackets up there. You can ask the NPC about
each one by phrasing it in QUESTION form.

A majority of the times, if the NPC does not respond to you when you
include the word in brackets, that means you phrased it wrong.
