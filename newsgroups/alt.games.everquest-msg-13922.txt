Well, Cuckoos Egg is the bible for getting familiar on the subject, as the
technology has not changed. Of course, both of you ignore the fact that the
Government and business reports I posted cite to the identical same problems,
and most of them were within the past 3 years.

But then again, you are just here to be insultive. It is obvious you know
nothing about the subject, and insults are all you got. 

In fact, neither of you have cited a single thing despite my repeated
challenges to support your positions...

No, I take it back, Lokari did post a web page with zero authority. Of course,
as the definition of "script kiddies" she supplied supported my position I
guess I should have mixed feelings about her failure.

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
