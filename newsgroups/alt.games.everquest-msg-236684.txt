The only time an RPG death afffected me emotionally at all was playing
Diablo 2 in Hardcore mode which means once you die, that character can't be
played anymore and all items and money on him are gone for good, if it was a
high lvl char I had gotten mad at the game and then wouldn't play for a few
days.  But then I played and would be back to normal.
