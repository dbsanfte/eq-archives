Might be, I'm pretty sure the pally that I group with on a regular
basis doesn't have that one. If it's an AA, I doubt it would be all
that useful in that situation, probably has a cycle time of several
minutes.

I've never actually had to get a rez after a mission but I imagine it
would be a pain. No gating out since I'd have to get a loc of the
dungeon entrance. Waste an hour waiting for corpse to pop since we'll
usually finish a mission with around 30 minutes to spare. Bug a
friendly cleric or pally to run down there and rez me. 

I know a lot of people prefer to rez after the adventure but I'd just
as soon get it over with. Time really isn't ever critical enough where
you can't handle having one person medding back up through a couple of
fights.

I don't think I'd want to take 75% rezzes on a regular basis but yeah,
a 90% is plenty. ... I never have understood the people that will pass
up a high end pally rez and waste time looking for a cleric.

Enchanters are my least favorite class to have on a normal LDoN
adventure, but any group I'm in has a shaman (hence haste) which tends
to bias my view.  Their two main abilities for LDoN, pacification
pulling and mez, aren't really useful with how we do the dungeons and
you always seem to run across one or two highly MR mobs which end up
smooshing your average chanter if he happens to have to mez it. Our
chanter also has a high lvl mage and he always ends up bringing that
one to LDoN.
