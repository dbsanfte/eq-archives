Taken from an interview at games domain:
http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/previews/sep01/luclin.html

GD= Gamesdomain Interviewer
BM= Brad McQuaid

GD: How do you think the players' population has changed as the game has
matured?
BM: Well, we still see a pretty good mix. The majority of our players are
above level 50, but there are still quite a few players lower level, people
coming in new to the game, starting characters over. <snip>

and

GD: Ok, to start off, what do you think is the lifespan of EverQuest in its
current form?
BM: Who knows? (laughs) We strongly believe EverQuest is still growing,
we've got over 410,000 active subscribers right now, so it's our opinion
that EverQuest has a very bright future ahead of it, and we plan on
supporting it long term

So they are saying there is over 200,000 level 50+ players in EQ?

WOW!

Anybody else find that number surprising? Or maybe I just haven't been to
the right zones yet.
