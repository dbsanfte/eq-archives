> is there ANY way a ranger can beat a rogue ? (snicker)

Rangers are actually pretty better suited to PvP than PvM. A couple of
things to keep in mind:

-use the bow.
-whilst resist gear is rare use root/snare.
-you can self SoW once later on, when resist gear gets more common.
-damage sheilds are good.
-first buff on, first buff off. Bury your SoW and damage shield deep.

    A good way to do your PvP homework is visit sites with PvP guides. By
all means read the one of your own class, but take it with a grain of salt
as people tend to be one eyed about their own class.

    Now read the PvP guides for all other classes, you will see how other
classes see Rangers. Make special note of what they say to be careful of and
use it all the time - this changes from class to class. Take extra care in
areas they label as a Rangers weakness and remember this also changes
completely depending on the class you are fighting.
