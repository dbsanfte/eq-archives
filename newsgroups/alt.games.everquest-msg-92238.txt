Bash (of any type) ain't what it used to be.  I can remember when
landing a bash attack always interrupted a caster.  Then a few months
ago I noticed that I was channelling thru when mobs bashed me.  Since
then I've noticed mobs channelling thru my bashes as well.  Seems like
bash now has four results:  miss, hit for damage, hit for damage with
immediate interrupt, and hit for damage with stun.  Quick casting stun
spells are much more reliable except against very resistant opponents.
