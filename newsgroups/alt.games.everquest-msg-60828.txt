It's more or less 3 hours online on any character or on the character screen
(or perhaps on any character anywhere on that account no matter what
server).  I say "more or less" because there's probably some weird
offline/online deadline rules like the rotting corpse thing (24 hours online
or 1 week offline, except each hour you're online means MORE than an our
offline that you lose blah blah coma time trying to figure it out).

Bottom line is if you're going to be online the whole time, get it inside 3
hours.  If you're going to be offline at all, try to do it within 2 hours
online knowing that you should have some leeway.
