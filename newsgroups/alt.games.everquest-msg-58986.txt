It really really depends on what you like and dislike about EQ.

- If the graphics aren't nice enough, go with DAOC.  They're not that much
better, but they ARE better.

- If you HATE inane zone-wide chatter, go with DAOC...it's as quiet as a
funeral parlor.

- If you can find nothing to do during down time in EQ, PROBABLY go to DAOC.
I'm playing both.  My highest is a level 16 spell caster.  If I'm OOM and
soloing it still takes a couple minutes to med up.

It's not nearly as immersive as EQ.  The more I play DAOC the more I truly
realize how much more work went into creating EQ.  How much more heart.
DAOC strikes me as a cookie-cutter game...like they bought The Realm and
made it better. :)  The basic premise is interesting (defending your home
land) but there's really no point to it beyond PvP fun (if you're into
that), as far as I can tell.  You can play from level 1 - 50 without doing
PvP, but they have already said they're going to penalize you if you don't,
by not giving you the same opportunities as those who do.  The basic premise
behind THAT comment is solid...your role in life is to defend your home
land...if you don't, you don't deserve certain things...but it doesn't
really sit that well with some anti-PvP people.

Don't get me wrong, DAOC is a decent enough game.  I'm not going to
recommend you don't buy it.  I figure I'll probably be playing it for
another month or two at least.
