In the past, there have been dup bugs involving corpses, I believe.  Perhaps
there was a dup bug that only worked if you were 65?  If to exploit the bug
you had to take some unressed deaths, having a way to get fast XP would be
very useful.  (I'm not saying this *is* it...just trying to come up with
something at least remotely plausible).
