 Was it just the static mob or additional mobs as well? Karnors is a bad
place when it comes to aggro issues due to the roamers and the shared
aggro. I can't remember the last time I've feigned, let a static get
back home and then stand and have it reaggro. Unless a roamer was
involved. The roamer will come back for you and more than likely reaggro
the static. The reason Karnors is bad for this is because of the lovely
lazy aggro thing Verant introduced with Kunark.
