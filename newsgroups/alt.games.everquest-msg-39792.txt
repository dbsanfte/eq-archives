    You're right. And AD&D never sent the same creature at you, level after
level. Why, when I was in my first module I fought Orcs. Then we went up
"Against the Slavers", and I fought orcs. Then we fought "Against the
Giants", and cleaning out the basement of the Hill Giant Steading put us up
against.... orcs. At least Descent Into The Depths of the Earth had
Troglodytes. :-/

    X hours to level, Y hours to camp/purchase needed equipment to kill the
mob, Z hours to gather folks/plan strategy. Tell me what else you put into
this game other than your time.

    Yes, I am. When people are asked, "Why don't you like AC?" this is one
of the reasons given - so it contributes. It ain't ALL of it, but I didn't
say it was.

>Relevant why?

      One of the issues in TCC coding is the amount of time one spends able
to access a TCC-restricted area. In EQ, TCC is being used to protect the
lower levels, the ones people fly through the fastest. To access all
TCC-restricted content you need to run around willy-nilly, "sampling" each
area. In a 200-level system I imagine you have a LOT more time to get to a
level-restricted area, as there's a lot more "mid-game".

    If the sandbox had diamonds and the answers to next week's Trig test in
it, you bet I'd jump in with pail in hand. If the sandbox somehow had the
answers to why we're here in it, time to build a castle. That's the issue -
the rewards in the zones that players wish to posess MUST have value to
them, otherwise they wouldn't be there. Whether those rewards are lore about
the game or tangible (items).

    Congrats to him - Velk's can be pretty rewarding. How did the rest of
his group do? Oh, and what about all those folks LFGing at zone - did they
get groups, and win drops? Repeat for your comments about Sebilis. Lord,
I've spent an entire play session of four hours in Crypt in Sebilis and come
away DOWN on cash (no drops for me, cash spent on Peridots).

    Nope. They have to group to get something at their level, but can go own
anything beneath them. Same as me. That mid level can go beat Emperor Crush
silly if he likes to get a resist gear tunic that will last him for ages.
And as he levels, more and more of the world opens up to him.

>Um, just remind me why you should be able to do that and they
>shouldn't?

    If I cannot, then what is the TRUE reward for levelling? I grow LESS
powerful compared with the mobs I "should" be fighting. No matter what
"level appropriate" gear I get, the mobs get better, faster - all top gear
does is allow one to keep up with them. As I level, I *require* more and
more friends to accomplish any meaningful "level appropriate" goal. So, um,
where's the reward? Why bother levelling if it makes you weaker, not
stronger in some respect?

    You ARE on to something here. But, of course, you're throwing emotional
language in to cloud the issue. Are you saying that it is intentional that
players become weaker compared with the environment they are expected to
interact with as they level? Is levelling meant to be penalized?

    You have the exact same rights I do: to attempt to kill anything in the
game that isn't engaged. Whether you CAN kill it or not is a function of
level.

    That's nice. Don't impose your views on my play time.
