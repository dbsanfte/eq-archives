I'm sorry, I used sloppy wording. :) I should have said "existing highway
traffic" instead of "moving traffic", because like you point out, the
merging traffic is moving as well.  And the handbook, at least, was clear
that traffic on the highway has the right of way.

Course...I suppose someone could debate what "on the highway" means and
insist that a merge ramp is part of the highway...

Gorramit, my eyes got crossed again. /sigh
