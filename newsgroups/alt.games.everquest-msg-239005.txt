Hmmm, you see, I;'m not sure the 20k price wasn't mostly due to the
general mudflation and the "try and sell it for as much as yo can and
see who bites" attitude I see in the bazaar a  fait amount.

FWIW, my borther's monk bought the PVC for 4K a week ago, pre nerf.
Obviously, the seller thought that was enough to cover his costs
and/or effort and still make a decent profit.  The higher prices were
just rampant bazaar greed.
