Palastians use what they have available to fight off their invaders... last
time I looked, I didn't see much in the way of Palastinian attack
helicopters to attack Israeli government/millitary buildings

I don't see the big difference in the 2 sides..  the way I see it they both
murder innocent people, they both have blood on their hands.. the only
difference I see, is 1 side does it with the blessing of the US and the
other is labelled terrorists.

(I dont in any way support the suicide bombers and the like.. I think its
truly scummy.. im just not ignorant to the fact of WHY they are doing it)
