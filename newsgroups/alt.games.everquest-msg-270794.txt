Yep, I'm running a 128MB GeForce 4, with the most recent drivers. Also 
running a P4, 2.5GHz processor with 512MB RAM.

I can't be sure they exist but a recent test between my machine, and a 
friend's similar configuration (same ram and graphics card, similar 
processor) showed he was running a few newly released games at 
performance settings (shadows, some reflecting, middlin 
textures...equivalent to EQ2's Performance settings) without any hiccups 
or slowdowns. I, meanwhile, get what in my opinion feels like hardware 
slowdown...memory bottlenecks, with the game stalling for a microsecond 
every few minutes then going back to full strength.

As an example, Counter-Strike:Source/Half-Life 2 is reporting a 50 - 
100fps range, yet giving the performance of around 10 - 20 fps. EQ2 is 
pretty similar.
