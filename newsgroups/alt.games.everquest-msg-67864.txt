>Can I camo and "sneak" in behind him and turn in braids!

 No. There are two problems with that:

a) He and his friends are undead so camo wont help you with them

b) Captain Rotgrime is facing his troops, so no matter which side you
sneaked to one of the skellies would see you.

 You could probably use regular camo to get past the golem and close to
the marines then have someone cast Invis to Undead on you. Then,
assuming this person isn't kos there, have them hail Rotgrime to have
him turn. From that point you may potentially be able to sneak and hand
them in. Note, however, that every few minutes he turns and walks to the
other end of the skelly line, regardless of whether he's hailed.
