Help?  yes.  Solve?  no.  The players with the best "cheat" tools
and highest level bots in the highest performing PCs will take
most of the best "stuff" for themselves.  Kill stealing is not
in any way adressed by random named spawns (which does NOT make
it a bad idea).

Trains are both good and bad.  Just ask anybody who's been
trained out of a camp by some anonymous dick playing a PL'd
19th free-account monk with no provable ties to the guild or
pharmer using the tactic.

In your view perhaps, but in mine and many others that claim
is far from anything vaguely resembling truth.

Instanced "dungeons" are FAR more immersive than than non-
instanced.  Google thread subject "The Lower Guk Experience"
for theis newgroup to understand exactly how incredibly
mind-bogglingly stupid non-instanced content inevitably
becomes when taken to an extreme.  Well short of that, DT is
exactly correct that tripping over umpteen other "heroes"
and groups thereof is exceeding anti-immersive.

SOE's cheesy implementation of instancing, with it's idiotic
"lore" (so moronic and childish that it deserves the quotes),
cookie-cutter dungeons, and totally uninspired psuedo-DKP
reward system still manaaged to provide more entertainment
than 2 years worth of expansions prior to it.  Luclin sucked,
PoP sucked far worse, and you and rest of the 10% of the EQ
player population that wrecked the game by driving the devs
to remake EQ as "raiders, raiders, uber alles" cannot change
that fact no matter how many smart-alecky comments you post
about it.
