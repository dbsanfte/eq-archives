OK, the horse is dead, it's corpse has been beaten to a pulp.  Does it
really matter if someone calls it a nerf or not?  I think most everyone is
in agreement as to what happened.  The tunic was labeled as BST/VAH usable
prior to Luclin release, upon release, it was no longer labeled as such.  Is
that a "nerf"?  Who cares?  It was changed, I don't think anyone is
disputing that.  Someone bury the horse.  Please.
