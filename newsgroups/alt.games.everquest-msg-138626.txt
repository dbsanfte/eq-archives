Well that's cool, but I'd like to see the cite. So far several people
have referenced the cite but no one has yet to post a link to one.
And even then the PR guys from Verant have been known to spout
off about game mechanics and then come back later with 'oops!'
when the real info is known.

Actually I went and did some digging and found the quote myself:

Seems its from march:

Q: Is there a code imposed limit on the number of pets that can be
actively engaging a single monster, and if so what is that limit?

A: "Yes.  No more than four pets can engage a single target.  This
is basically to prevent use of only pets to defeat opponents.  We
think it's important to have some player characters involved in
the combat at times.  :)"

Angry? Hostile? I just called it bullshit. How is that angry or hostile?

Does'nt 'offend' me at all. All I want is proof. If there is a 4 pet limit
it would be nice to know. But so far I have not seen any evidence
for it. Where is it? Seems to me it would be fairly easy to prove.
Send 5 pets to attack a mob, log it, then post the proof?

People spout bullshit and rumors all the time in this newsgroup
but every once in a while some actual truth is posted. Would be nice
to know if this one is true or not.
