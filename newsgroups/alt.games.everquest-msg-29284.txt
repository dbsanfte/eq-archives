Well, there is a "feature" in the game. When you zone out you are actually
still in the same zone as you were for a few seconds. You can die in this
period of time or go to an extremely small amount of health (under 10 hp for
instance). When you zone in you are then instantly teleported to a
"safespot" in the target zone with all spells on you dispelled and health
restored to what it was right after you hit the zoneline.
