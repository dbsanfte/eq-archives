I have changed my account from monthly regular to monthly Station Pass 
before, and when I did, I lost whatever time I had remaining on my current 
billing cycle. My billing date changed at that point to the date I made the 
change. I clarified this with a SoE support rep.

I would be surprised if you can in any way recoup any of that yearly 
subscription fee. Your best bet is to just cancel and let it run out before 
you resubscribe to a different plan.
