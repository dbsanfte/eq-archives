Was wondering if anyone has seen these things near Qeynos...

I have killed tons of rats and gnolls (in Qeynos North/Hills and
BlackBurrow), and have yet to see even ONE pelt of any kind from a gnoll, or
an eye from a rat.  Any suggestions?

Also, near Qeynos, is there a merchant that sells sharpening stones?

Thanks,

JD
