Not to be a cross server trading pig or anything (well, actually yeah
to be exactly that), but any of you willing to trade pp on FV for pp
on Test? I've had a hankering to play on FV again recently but if
there's one thing I hate about starting over (something I've done
about eight times now from square one) its not having a decent weapon.

Can handle up to 60k or so.

Alternatively if you're carrying around a few weapons with low or no
recommended levels, I'd pay good pp for those instead... of course
again the pp would be on Test. :-)
