Sorry, that certainly wasn't the most telling article on the subject.
Unfortunately most of the news services have already rolled off these
older articles. Here is another, plus an interesting snippet I was
able to dig up...

http://www.avpress.com/n/mosty7.hts

And...

"One of the Valley's most politically active clergyman, a volunteer
chaplain with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, on Thursday
acknowledged his role in a rowdy demonstration against followers of
the Wiccan religion. The Rev. Billy Pricer, founder and executive
director of United Community Action Network, or U-CAN, in Lancaster,
admitted he was among the group of Christians who circled the Witches
Grove store on Lancaster Boulevard during a rededication ceremony."


Pricer was quoted in one article as saying that it wasn't an organized
activity - it was spontaneous. In another, he said representatives
from three different churches showed up. Hmmm. Three groups from
different churches all show up in rental vehicles to disrupt a
religious service, but it wasn't organized? Sure, and I'm not a witch.

Certainly it wasn't a demonstration that followed any of the teachings
of Christ that I'm familiar with, but it very much was a demonstration
of Christians. They aren't more free from hypocrisy than any other
segment of the population, after all. 

> What can you do?

Expose their acts of hatred to the full light of the moon and the sun,
and show them for what they really are - small, hateful people.
That's what.
