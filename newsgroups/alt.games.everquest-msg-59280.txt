At that level, the STR buff is basically useless.  Just as an example, I ran
a level 15 warrior through Copeland with a few different weapons.  The
difference between the damage output of a level 15 warrior with 100 STR and
a level 15 warrior with 125 STR was on the order of 3 or 4 points per
minute.  Now, if the buff is needed for encumbrance purposes, then I would
do it.  I usually give the STR buff if asked, but I don't vollunteer it, it
just doesn't make enough difference.  I do buff with STA (particularly if
any of the damage dealers are below 100 STA), AGI, HP, AC (Depends on who
else is in the group for both HP and AC), and if they have a proccing
weapon, DEX.  For anyone else in the group, depends who else is casting
what, and how much mana I have, but HP, AC, and AGI are the ones I usually
use.  The ones who are usually most thankful for the STA buff are those
silly rangers with less than 100 STA.
