In a word: horseshit. There are plenty of willfully ignorant end users
out there: ones whose attitude is, "I paid a fortune for this thing.
There's no way I'm going to READ in order to be able to use it" or, "I
don't know what that is, but I want it," or "I won't bother to retain
this information. I can always call back when I need to do it again."

Or, my favorite: the day trader who was convinced that anyone working
in the IT department *must* be there to attend to his every whim and
who would routinely corner whichever one of us was foolish enough to
make eye contact when he walked into the web dev department.

If you've dealt with tens of thousands of people in ANY walk of life
and haven't met a stupid one, you're probably just too dumb to
recognize them.
