Thanks! That's exactly what I was looking for.  I was heading out to do 
the GLS quest last night when I mentioned it to a high-level bard friend 
who said, I quote "you're prepared to die a lot, right?" so I held back.  
Is he just paranoid? :)  Oh yeah.  And if I *do* do the quest, what's the 
best place to bind, assuming I have the bind affinity and can bind 
anywhere I like. (*eyes shaman and mentally wills her to hit level 14*) 
(*drools over level 14 shaman spells*)
