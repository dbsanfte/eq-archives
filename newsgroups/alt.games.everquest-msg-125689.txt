Did you actually read what he posted?  Perhaps a bit of repetition will
help you:  "it cancels in order that the effects were placed on you".
Do you see anything there about buff slots?  Do not confuse the Cancel
Magic spell line with whatever you may have heard about the AOE effects
available to dragons, they are not identical.

Oh, and here's a way you can test this for yourself.  Take care to
ensure that your most important survival buff (SoW perhaps?) is the
oldest (least recently cast) when fighting dispelling mobs (brownies
are nice, also drachnids) that are just a wee bit too tough for you
(pick a fight with several at once if you're tough enough to solo
singles).  The frustrating experience of dying (preferably repeatedly)
to an encounter that you should easily be able to escape should help
you remember how the spell works in the future.

One final lesson, locate an officer of a guild you would like to join.
Engage this person in conversation, asking for advice on some specific
issue of gameplay.  Then, should you succeed in gaining some valuable
information, "correct" this person with some special piece of ignorant
misinformation based on hearsay.  Be sure that your insulting know-it-
all attitude is quite clear in the words and manner of your correction.
After this pleasant experience, apply for membership in the guild.
This experience should help you learn to have second thoughts (tho
perhaps third or fourth would be even better) before choking yourself
on those fungus infested appendages you use for walking.
