My own opinion that the Drakkin models and animations are horrible has 
pretty much removed much of what desire I had to play the new content. I 
don't know if anyone else feels the same way, but I'm pretty much back to 
business as usual at this point. Heck, I didn't even get any new bank slots 
or anything out of this particular expansion. It was a waste of my money as 
far as I'm concerned.
