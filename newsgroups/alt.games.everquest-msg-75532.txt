I got mine working again too.  After fiddling with the in-game controls, the
SBLive settings and the PC volume controls to no avail, I turned up the
volume using the software that came with my speaker/subwoofer group.  Sound

standing on one of the platforms, it almost blows my speakers out.  Have to
turn the volume waaay down just to make it bearable.
