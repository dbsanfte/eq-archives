So, your ranger and monk are exceptions? And I avoided the skullhead
problem with my SK by giving her a rygorr coif. I'm tempted to do the
same with my warrior (she's wearing a BI coif and has a SSB in bank)
My monk got reincarnated because as fun as she was at low levels, I
knew she would never make it out of her teens. I needed her to be
something I could tinker around with while solo at whatever level and
with whatever gear, so she became a mage. Then I decided I needed a
human druid somewhere and I didn't want my FV druid anymore, so...
