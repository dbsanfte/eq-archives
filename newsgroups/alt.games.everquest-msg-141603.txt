Don't put your eyes out.
That would make it the last thing that you ever see.
Not a nice image to be constantly pasted on to the black void.

Drift : Read in a PC mag today that someone had developed a version of
quake for the blind. It uses 3-d sound queues to suggest that there are
corridors windows etc. Also there is a signature sound for each weapon
power up etc.

Apparently a blind player "pasted" several "uber" sited players.

Hee hee. Bet they cant do that for Eq :-/
