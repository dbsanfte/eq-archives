Men are as capabale of "fits of pique" as well as outright greed as women.
Menstruation has nothing to do with it.  Imagine the scenario below. . .

Female_player: Gee, I better not go on that Hate Raid with the guild
tonight.

Male_player: Why not?

Female_Player: Well, I'm on the rag and I might just loot everything in
sight...I get so *greedy* during that time of the month, and not to mention
stupid...

I mean honestly, some people are just assholes, it isn't a gender specific
trait, eh?:)
