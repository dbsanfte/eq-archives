Mine is numpad 0, so far out of the way that I couldn't possibly hit it
typing, even if I missed the key I was trying to hit (I do that sometimes,
especially when I'm doing a lot of chatting and trying to type faster than I
really can :) ), and it's close to my pinky when I'm using the movement keys
so I can run up to a MOB or a player and hit it quickly and easily.
