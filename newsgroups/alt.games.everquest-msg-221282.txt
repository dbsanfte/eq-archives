You can send a tell to someone in their guild and find out who their officers
are and send a /tell to him.  I don't do this if the officer appears to be in a
combat zone of their appropriate level.  I send an e-mail via their website
instead.  Doing a *search* on "everquest their guild name" usually works.
I rarely argue with someone over a kill steal.  People who *work* at making you
mad are doing it intentionally.  They like it when you respond.  They *want*
conflict.  There are too may zones to play in to let one asswipe ruin my day.  
I always figure the EQ gods will get them some day.....
