While you're correct on most points, I'm concerned about two fronts:

a) this if alt.games.everquest not alt.philosophy or something

b) I don't *quite* agree with your attitude to education.

Yes schools get it horribly wrong and need to be redesigned/factored 
out. Yes teachers are optimally trained to bore the living fuck out of 
kids. Yes courses need to be thrown out and largely rewritten. Yes 
education is something you do all your life, not for 13 years. Yes most 
'education' IS just conformist brainwashing.

However, I feel your message needs to talk non-school education up a bit 
more. I don't mean taking kids out of school (schools don't get it 
perfectly right but they don't get it totally wrong, and some 
alternatives are known to be worse), but kids and young adults learning 
to seek knowledge and educate themselves.

Regards,
James
