: How about the next EQL Expansion?

I understand the next expansion is called 'Dragons of Norrath', and is
underway. It has been recently referenced on the official boards, but
not officially announced. No idea what the content will be, but from the
title alone it looks like they're paying attention to the demands to
ditch all the alien/other-dimensional bullshit. 

I can guess the release date - it will be as soon as I get ready to tackle
some decent OoW content, and it will draw all the other players from
zones I'd like to group in.
