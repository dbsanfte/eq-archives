With my fighting Charisma of a little under 210 (self buffed), I find that
Pacify works quite well for me. Mind you, Pacify does have a level 55 cap...
and I'm only 52 (as of last time I played, just dinged) so I'm not bumping
the cap yet on targets.
Wake of Trainquility..er Tranquility, the Enchanter are lull spell, caps at
60, but I haven't been using that one much.
One quick way to get a lot of Chr in a hurry is to get a tradeskill to 250,
and make a trophy. +10 int, wis, str, and +50 chr in a range slot is nice.
I know a gnome enchanter who's entire 'special chr gear' load is a
jewelcraft and tinkering trophy + his 40 point self chr buff...

Note that people look at me weird when I tell em I'll split the camp. They
think I'm just gonna pull everything and start mezzing (well, that is what I
used to do :)
