The easiest place to go is Devin Tracial in PoK, since everyone can access
it now.  She is near the library entrance between the large bank and small
bank.  basicly behind the building with the dwarven smithers.

When you talk to her you say Travel NOT Travel to Shadowrest or you will get
stuck in the npc chat loop as Shadowrest is also a keyword.

You have to wait the week until body would normally disappear.  Then speak
to the big scary looking guy that is in Shadowrest  I think his name Keeper
of Lost Souls? (Been a while since i"ve been there)


Sedce Frozentears
57 Shaman Terris Thule
and various others spread on many servers.
