Not sure about the first part, but the second part is untrue for a person
who has no desire to install the latest expansion.  The original continents
and Kunark (haven't tried Velious yet, but the requirements for that don't
seem much more than Kunark) run fine, with the exception of exceptionally
long zone times.  Stop making blatantly false blanket statements.  You don't
need a P3 or even a P2 to enjoy the game.  a fast P1 is definitely more than
adequate, with a decent video card and a reasonable amount of RAM.
