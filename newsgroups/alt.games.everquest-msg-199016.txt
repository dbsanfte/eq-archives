Yes I have inves.  But it is not 100% reliable yet.  I try to use it as
often as I can to get the skills up but my skill lvl is not that high.  That
's why I needed to know where the CC zone point before I attempted the run.
Its not pretty to get caught with inves down surrounded by KOS mobs, and don
't have the clue where to go!

Thanks for all the info.

Emilio.
