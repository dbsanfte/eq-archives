I'M THE VICTIM OF AN EXPLOIT!!!

This happenes to me a LOT.  When I cast my Cinder Bolt, some mobs will move
behind objects or terrain so that they can't be hit!!!

I DEMAND these mobs be BANNED NOW for exploitation!!!!

P.S.  I heard that their main tank was using a right-clickable CH item to
maintain aggro in addition to the CoH of their clerics.  Sounds like intellegent
aggro managment to me.

..of course I'm mad...
Spiders?  What spiders?
