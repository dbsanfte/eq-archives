Hello All,

I bought the EQ trilogy about 4 months ago, and was instantly hooked. 
A month or so later, I bought SoL, since I had heard all of you talk
about the improved graphics as well as the bazaar.  However, when I
installed SoL, there was a huge performance drop as compared to what
pre-SoL system performance was.

So, being the EQ junkie that I am, I started upgrading my system to
help enhance my overall gaming experience.

To give you an idea of what I was using then, and what I am using
now...

Then:
AMD Duron 900 Mhz
512 MB PC133 SDRRAM
Voodoo 3 2000 PCI 16 MB
Diamond Audio Sound Card
6 Gig. 5.25 inch bigfoot HDD
Various modems/ethernet cards
Cable Internet w/ Motorola cable modem
Windows 2000 Server

Upgraded to:
AMD Athlon XP 1700 @ 1.47 GHz
512 MB PC2100 266 MHz RAM
GeForce4 MX 420 64 MB AGP (yeah I know this card sucks)
Creative Sound Blaster PCI Audio Card
40 Gig. 3.5 inch 7200 RPM Maxtor HDD
Same modems/ethernet cards, cable modem, etc...
Still using Windows 2000 Server

Ok, so EQ runs a lot better now than it did before the upgrade.  Zone
loading times are a lot shorter, and I can run the game with all of
the new Luclin models turned on.  However, there are still some times
when things get a little choppy, and start to slow down, even in zones
with only 2 or 3 other people in them.  Not just the Luclin zones,
either, although I do notice it happening more there.

So my question is this: In the opinion of all of the computer gurus
here, would upgrading to a Geforce4 TI series card make much of a
differnce in my EQ experience?  I know that the MX series cards do not
support anti-aliasing, where the TI series cards do.  Would this take
care of a lot of the "jaggies" that I am seeing now?  Do you think
there would be any other improvements that I would see after switching
to a better card?  The local Wal-Mart has a TI 4200 128 MB on
clearance for $140 right now, and I am tempted to get it, if it will
improve things in the game.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance for
all of your help.
