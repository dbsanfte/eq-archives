Do the magician epic and get back to me about how
it's worth doing simply to have done it.  How many
Hate raids HOPING Magi P'tasa is up?  If he's up,
PRAYING that he has the earth staff.  If he's up
and actually has the bloody staff - you still have
to beat out 2-4 other mages for the damn thing.

That's just *1* part of the bloody epic.

How about getting raid after raid after raid together
to take out Phinny, and STILL not getting the 
water staff?  At least that one's easier to get
people for since there are multiple epic drops on
him.

How about getting your fire staff - again requiring
multiple hate raids and beating out all the mages
there.

You've gotten all those parts?  Ok, now get your
guild to raid Sky all the way to the *7th* island
and farm for crowns.  It used to take most guilds
several *DAYS* to reach the 7th island.

Frankly, with the announcement that PoP was going
to have a level increase, I gave up on the mage
epic, knowing that new pets were going to be 
introduced that would make the epic only situationally
useful.
