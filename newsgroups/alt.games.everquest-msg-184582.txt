At lower levels, ie before you get double attack, the shield is useful, especally if you are
fighting any casters. After getting double attack, I only use my shiled when I'm fighting undead,
Ghoulsbane is a wonderful weapon. Symbol if Nife allows you to have any weapon proc against
undead as a Ghoulsbane, so the 2hs becomes a major damage dealer with the proc. I also like to use
it with my coldain velium mace, double proc, but with the shield.   Hummm, I wonder if my shield
would proc with Nife? Never seen it happen yet.
