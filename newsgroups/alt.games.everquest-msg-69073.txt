Nvidia geforce 2 mx 400 64 meg is better than either and still 80 -
100 or less.  yes, the geforce has hardware TNL.

I have a tnt 16 meg agp which is actually still okay with EQ with all
the new models enabled, low textures, and 384 meg ram (p2 400) I don't
see the point of upgrading to a 32 meg geforce when the 64 can be the
same price or less. 32 meg is really pretty dead today and is more of
a waste of money since in less than a year you'll probably feel like
you'd need a 64 meg (well really you might feel like that with the 32
meg right now) To get a 32 meg card would be like if with the system
above when I upgraded I got a p2 600 proc or something; it would cost
money that I could instead spend on an athalon 1.3 and a new MB or
something yet it would not help me a lot.
