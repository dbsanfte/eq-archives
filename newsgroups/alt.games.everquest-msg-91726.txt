Add in Bloodmaw (alleged 20th lvl spawn). While he may not compare with the
kromriff recruiter in level differences, killing him takes forever and he
doesn't hit like a pansy either.

He's permarooted and not naturally KOS (quest mob) so it's most likely a
purposeful undercon to deter utter slaughter of this mob.

As a 20th lvl mob though, I've seen him charmed and used to slay a shardwurm
that was trained to the cave wall where he resides.
