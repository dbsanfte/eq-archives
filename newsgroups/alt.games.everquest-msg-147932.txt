Here's another article I found:

http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/uniontrib/fri/currents/news_1c13remote.html

For what it's worth, I didn't play EQ on 9/11, and the only media I
exposed myself to on 9/11 was Howard Stern's radio show and the VH-1
rebroadcast of "The Concert for New York City".

(part of Howard's show included a re-broadcast of his show from
9/11/2001 when the attacks happened.  Yesterday on his show he said he
got an irate e-mail from a woman who complained about him
re-broadcasting the show from last year; apparently she actually
thought the attack was happening in real time!!)
