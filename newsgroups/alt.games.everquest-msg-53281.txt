I seriously object to being inspected unasked.  I also have a bio
message that I want people to read.  And lastly, I leave the
inspection message on so I know when people do it.  Why?  Because it's
a quick and dirty method of gauging someone's politeness.

I almost never get annoyed about inspections when I'm banking,
especially in Kelethin.  It's easy to mis-target in there.  (The idiot
who was spam-inspecting me, though...)

On the other hand, those who are doing it out in the open are doing it
deliberately, and if they do it without permission, it affects my
opiniion of them.  When I inspect someone, *even* someone who's
selling "all the gear on me", I ask permission first.
