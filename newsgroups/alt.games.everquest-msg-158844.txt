What level was the wizard?  If he was your level I'm surprised he didn't
have a port up to try to get you all out in one piece.

Anyway, you did ok. Each group at lower levels *should* have a plan
ahead of time for who will call the evac/Run! command and how you will
proceed in that event when dungeon crawling. In xp groups, it is
beneficial to get out rather than take a wipeout. Particularly to get
*you* out since corpses can be dragged and you can rez folks back in.
(And even give them a little experience back now at your level, yes? Not
sure.) 

Later on in your career it will change. On large scale raids in horrible
places, you (as the cleric) will be told "CLERICS CAMP OUT", at which
point you will bravely sit your ass on the ground and hit /camp.  The
rest of the raid will stand and fight and die to buy you thirty seconds
to camp.

Then, when the coast is clear, (as verified by a FD monk or necro) you
will log back in, rez all of our dead asses, and move on with the raid.
