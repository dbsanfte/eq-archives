Well.. run the post by your officers or guild leader, do they really not
care, or is that an assumption?

Your post was laden with spoiler info =)  Things like that generally make
the powers above pretty pissed, especially if it aids your competition in
beating something faster (anything faster than what you did it is gaining on
you, afterall). And even more espcially on a server that has no rotations
and is full blown FCFS/FFA.

Not an objection.. just an observation. I mean the info is meaningless to
me, were in Tacvi (6th? serverwide to beat Inktu'ta, so its been a while),
but when I read your post I saw a lot of things that we had to learn by
wiping, then come back a few days later (after the lockout), thus extending
our learning process.  If I had read your post prior to us getting in the
zone, undoubtedly it would of shaved weeks off our learning process.

Im sure it might only shave 1 failed trip or a week at the most now (seems
herald, mites, cursecallers is common knowledge), wheras back when we were
there... first time engaging cursecallers with no info was a FAST wipe..
every guild who did it "back in the day" insta wiped on cursecallers because
of what it involves.. wheras know the DT part of it, and its an easy win on
day 1.

They don't need to know that you have an 8 cleric cheal chain with an x
second pause.. thats overkill. Just the rundown of what you posted is more
than enough to get from zonein to endzone fight on day 1.
