No, he's not.  Nobody is.  It's a story.

Besides, bear in mind that pretty much every political or religious leader
since John of Patmos had his 'visions' has been the antichrist at some stage
or another - according to the armchair theologists, at least.

Personally I can't help but wonder why everyone's so taken with Revelation
when they're all so keen to ignore the rest of the book...
