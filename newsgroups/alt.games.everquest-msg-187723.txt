Very true.  I use dialup sometimes, two boxing.  Zoning is slow but 
otherwise it is fine except for raids.  I think on a raid the server 
just can't send you all the character position updates because of 
bandwidth issues.  If you are getting packet loss at these times, try 
lowering the number in DataRate.txt file.  Asking everyone in the raid 
to stand still might work too :)
