I play a druid and have since I started the game back in the pre
kunark era. I have spent thousands of eq decades playing with the hg's
in RM and I have noticed a few things about root and snare.

Snare: 
Unless it is resisted from the get go, this spell never breaks unless
the mob is not dead after the total of the spell's duration has
passed. Even when cast on red cons in PoD I have never had a snare
wear off. (True some mobs run alot faster then others and snare is
less effective at times because of this. However, it never goes away
unless despelled.) At least never for me :)

Root:

Experience 1:
Dude, not as much on melle but I recall grouping with a shammy on the
HG's in RM. I was 46 at the time he was 32 or so. I snare and run down
sticky rock to the grassy vally that is my HG grave yard. I triple dot
(DoD, Imortalate, ES Bracer) the HG and root him. Then shammy shoots a
dot. It breaks root. He tries to re-root. Resisted. I shoot a root. He
shoots another dot. Breaks root again. I did this grouping with a
wizzy before too and the same thing. Breaks so often because of the DD
stuff.

Experience 2:
Used root on actually even cons at 46 (Guards and anything I could
find). Guards do not like this spell. If it takes it lasts like a
minute if you are lucky. I have rooted even the dwarf guards in bbm
for exp and they resist or break it way early nearly every time. HG's
did this to when I was trying to fight them at 30.

Experience 3:
I was helping my friend (A 34 Pally in OOT, I was umm... 52 at the
time I think). She was beating on things with her wormy and she had a
chard guadians shield or sonthing with a grapic simular to it fer the
bashing). The root duration did not seem to change nor was it broken
by a bash and I was using grasping roots to root it so I would not do
alot of damage and take the kill (My DS was on her to).

The items above are my experience (mostly). I'm not sure it it helps
this discussion but I was bored and wanted to post something :).

All in all I always saw root being broken as either because the
duration ended, the mob had the strength and resistance to pull free,
or it was blasted out of the ground and "FLASH FRIED". Hmm... Blood
Raven tenders and BBQ Sauce!
