	And my point would be, that you are a fucking moron.

	Night vision is the least of the benefits Iksar receive.  In fact, it
isn't even a "benefit" as such.  Since only three races in the game DON'T get
night vision, it is not the case that night vision is an advantage; rather,
the lack of it is a DISadvantage.

	Iksar get great stats, regen (enough so that my L22 Necro leezard does not
lose HP when sitting with Allure of Death on; that's an incredible advantage),
AC bonus, racial Swimming (start with 100 skill, appears to be no level cap)
and racial Foraging (which offsets their faction problems somewhat; you can
live off a 50 Forage if you're religious about hitting the button every time
it lights up).  Grow the hell up.
