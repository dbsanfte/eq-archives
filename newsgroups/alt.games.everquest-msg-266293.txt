I just had to vent but I had a problem with a moron.  I was in a group
who camped the OC in PoV a few hours today when someone just showed
up, no word or anything and started kiting a mob in front of us.  Had
he asked, we probably would have been fine and suggested he kite away
from us so we wouldn't accidently KS his mob.

Anyway we complained but he claimed there's no violation of rule in
what he did (disruption? I think that's a violation).  Some words were
exchanged and twice he trained us delibrately which killed my group
members.  He also /ooc [name removed] will never reach 70.

I did a /report of that as it's considered a threat and filed a
/petition on disruption and training.  But as GM were not online and
the moron didn't leave for over an hour.  He wasn't in a guild and he
was anon so I don't know what level but he conned red to me (60) which
would put him at around 65 or higher.

My group was tempted to start pulling a few mob and "accidnetly" lose
them to that moron but some of us left the group to go elsewhere.  I
don't know how it ended but the fact a moron just muscled in without
even asking just makes me wish I was in a PvP server.  6 of us could
propably wipe him out.

I just want to reach through the computer and plant a nasty virus on
the moron's computer, one designed to cause frequent LD if he doesn't
learn the manner.
