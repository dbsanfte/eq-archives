For acceleration. I love that feeling of being in control.

I was referring to doing this job yourself, buying a conversion kit and
doing all of the labor.

im afraid I cannot cite any links for it because I saw it on tv, I believe I
was watching speed channel at the time but not certain.

The whole show was dedicated to hybrids and the different forms of power
available, and what is planned for the future, the first part of the show
talked about natural gas and had a few segments with people who have
converted their own, talked about how much (surprisingly cheap I must say,
was suprised to hear it only cost 600), and the second half of the show
dealt mostly with hydrogen and some round-the-nation drive a group of people
did in hydrogen powered cars to show they were safe. with
powercells/solar/battery segments mixed throughout.  (if someone knows what
show this was and knows there website please link it)

I did some searching on google and found a couple sites that talk about all
the advantages of it, but didnt list anywhere to BUY the kit.. the closest
thing I could find was http://www.iangv.org/jaytech/ which may be of some
help if you use the discussion forum.
