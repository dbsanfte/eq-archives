Good ideas. If you've played DAOC you've seen #2 in action, it's very
do-able and useful to the players. Click a button you see all the groups
that need people. Click another button you see everyone who is LFG.
Unfortunately Verant has its head stuck too far up it's ass to see the value
of this. But don't worry they will spend hundreds of hours on minor
equipment changes instead.
