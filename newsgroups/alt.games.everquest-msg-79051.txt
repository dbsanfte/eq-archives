'/corpse playername' works too doesn't it? I've seen people doing multiple
CR at once, and assumed they had a macro like:

/corpse groupmember1
/corpse groupmember2

etcetc. If that doesn't work it must have been something like

/target groupmember1
/corpse

etc but that can only do two people per hotkey.
