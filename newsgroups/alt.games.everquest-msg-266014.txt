There are at least five known NPCs who give out city quests, but I only know 
of four. The guard at the bottom right of the castle steps in North Qeynos, 
the Caretaker Nogfizzle standing at the tree outside the entrance to the 
Temple of Life in North Qeynos, the guard at the tree elevator in Elddar 
Grove, and the first Pupil on the left as you enter the Mage's Tower in 
South Qeynos.

This emphasis on quest-driven progess is something I really like about both 
WoW and EQ2 and hope to see more of it in future MMORPGs. While it's always 
fun taking on mobs for loot and exp, you said it best: having a purpose 
makes all the difference.

Cool! I did not know it was possible to leave stuff in your apartment, I 
will remember that in retail and pick up a bookcase.

I got a call tonight from my game store telling me that they are actually 
receiving their copies on Nov 8 and that I can pick it up then. But I also 
heard that the SOE site shows a countdown timer to 10:00am Nov 9 for the 
game going live so it probably won't do much good to get it earlier than 
that.  I haven't been tracking all the server information that's starting to 
circulate, is there a UK server that is coming up corresponding to the 
game's availability in the UK?

Now that they've announced that there will be a designated Roleplaying 
server, I'm expecting quite a few of my old EQ friends from FV to start 
showing up. Should be fun!
