The Tower Guard's Blade is an excellent weapon, well worth 200 pp. It has a
good ratio, similar to the Langsaxe of Wolves, Axe of Iron Back, Blackened
Iron Bastard Sword, etc. and has the lowest delay of that whole range of
weapons. Any weapon has a hard cap of 10 damage through level 1-10 (a mith
staff, 28 45, becomes 10 45, making it worse than a fine steel sword 12 43,
10 43 under 10). The cap increases to 14 from levels 11-20, then increases
to 30 from 21-30. There is probably another from 31-40, but it has to be at
least 45 damage. Because of the low delay, the TGB is one of the best 2hs
weapons in the game below level 20. It has one of the lowest delays, there
are only eight quicker for Sks and all are hard to get Plane of Air etc.).
With the cap of 14, it does the same damage until level 20. Even after 20,
it's ratio is still nice, it will only lag behind around level 28-30, when
the damage bonus on slow weapons really kicks in. Another nice feature is
the relative quickness, you will spend very little time after levelling to
max 2hs. And of course 5 AC can't be forgotten.
