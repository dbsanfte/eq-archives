Well this is retracted now... both my streaming threads have been
taken of the air because of the new law passed by congress... you ask
what law....

Killed by the RIAA. June 20, 2002.
With CARP royalties of $500 a DAY, SomaFM cannot continue
broadcasting. 

Yes, you read right. $15,000 a month, $180,000 a year (well, based on
last month extrapolated over the next 12 months, we would have to pay
$176,541 in RIAA royalties. 

Don't listen to the RIAA press release that says most small webcasters
will only pay the minimum $500 a year. Any station with more than an
average of 5 concurrent listeners will be paying more than that
minimum. 

go to www.somafm.com to read their take on it..
