Nevermind decided to answer my own question =)

They still suck bigtime:

Small Metal Container       3.0     2     0%     Medium  T  Smithed
Medium Metal Container      4.5     4     0%     Medium  T  Smithed
Large Metal Container       6.0     8     0%     Medium  T  Smithed

Wow WTF is the point of putting something like this in the
game? Since no one will ever use them? *boggle*
