Few who use the phrase NBG ever bother to establish their own
definition of "need".  I simply tried to fill that vacuum by using the
conventional understanding of need, as it works in our society.  In
our society, luxuries are typically not considered "need", whereas
those things that sustain life are.

If you say "Need before Greed", and have a different definition of
need from conventional use, then perhaps you need to clarify that from
the start.  If this is not done, than you cannot blame me for using
the defintion I most readily understand, which is the conventional
definition.


>You don't "need" spells any more than a
> mellee needs a sheild. 

This is the point I was trying to make.  In EQ, very little is needed.
 Therfore, I find the word "need" to be inappropriately used.  Rather,
the word "desire" beter describes the value of an item to a palyer. 
I.e. the melee player desires the shield for its own use.  The caster
desires the shield because (with a little time spent auctioning) it
equates to a new spell for him/her.


> Now please can you expand on why you chose such a simplistic definition of "need"?

Because when you sate "Need" in a vague and general way, it really
only has one deifintion - that which is required to sustain life.  You
might say that in EQ, the needs are: A functioning computer and
internet connection, sufficient funds to pay VI for their product, and
the time/desire to play.  Beyond that, I see no "need".  If you would
like to define "Need" in a different way, please do so.  But
understand that this is not the conventional definition, and most
likely, the word "desire" would better serve to communicate your idea
(though perhaps it would undermine your rhetoric).

At first I thought you were finally defining what you meant by "need"
here, but instead all I understood were references to the golden rule
and a socialistic distribution of wealth.  Basically, what you hold to
be the idea distribution method for loot.  It appears to be based on,
for lack of a better phrase, the "immediate use" value system.  In
this system, things only have a vlue if they are of immediate use to a
player.  Why you ignore all other forms of value (resale value,
alt-twinking value, gift-giving value, etc.) is not quite clear.  This
ofcourse has nothing to do with need, but to do with the value each
player places on the loot.

Nor is common sense always right.  Common sense really means expedient
understanding.  This is often neither wise nor true.

Finally you are beginning to start a logical arguement.  Your first
assumption is stated here:

1) Immediate value is better/more important/more fair than delayed
value.

I fail to understand how my simple statement presumed to be the
definitive source of information for anything.  All I'm saying is that
when I group with a bunch of strangers, I assume they are not there
solely to benefit me.  They each have their personal desires/goals,
and I must respect that.

> Is that arrogance I detect or in my stupidity is there something major I am

Actually, the very opposite of arrogance.  With complete humility, I
engage in each pickup-group with the belief that my importance in the
EQ world is not so great as to cause a full group of decked-out
players to materialize out of thin-air with the express purpose of
obtaining for me the object of my phat-lewted desire.  I am quite
prepared to be a humble entity engaging in a reciprocally beneficail
manner with a group of equally empowered entities whose own desires
and goals are at least equal in importance and urgency to that of my
own.


> Your basing a logical argument on assumptions?

As you do yours.  As another poster pointed out, all logical
arguements have as their foundation certain assumptions.  Sometimes
these assumptions are implied (as in your arguement), other times they
are explicit (as in mine).
 
> Your assumptions are your own - each person has his own set.

Fair enough.  Though several assumptions in each "set" may be similar
or the same.  I.E. some of my assumptions may or may not be the same
as yours.

> I neither agree or disagree with your assumptions. 

That has yet to be seen, as you have not addressed my assumptions yet.
 At least not directly.

> else. 

On the contrary, unless we are posting simply to take up bandwith and
HD space on some nameless server, our assumptions are of complete
relevence.  Otherwise we could never understand where each other's
arguements arose from.
 
> You have not provided a logical argument yourself. 

You have me there.  I posted my assumptions, and my conclusion.  I
felt the logic in between was obvious, and that a discussion of the
underlying assumptions alone would suffice to decide the validity of
my conclusion.
However, if you insist, then here is my formal arguement.

I proposed (assume) that:
1) in EQ, there is no need, and therefore by default, only desire.
2) an item's value is only based on its immediate or delayed
usefulness to a player.
3) In pick-up groups, each player is entitled to an equal chance to
fulfill his desire (to gain equally from the grouping experience).

Therefore, if all "needs" in EQ are really desires, all players have
an equal right to fulfill their desires in pick-up grouops, and an
item's desirability is only equal to its delayed or immediate
usefullness to a player, then any player who finds an item usefull
either immediately or at a later time is equally entitled to that
item.  If all palyers are equally entitled to an item, then I propose
a random roll is a good method for deciding who gets the item.

Actually, facts are not always necessary in an ethical debate (such as
this one).  Logic is the verbal representation and/or mental
interpretation of mathematical law.  Facts only serve to substantiate
your assumptions, not to make your arguement logical.  In this
particular debate, we are dealing with ethical assumptions regarding
"fairness", and facts don't really help there.

See above regarding the structure of logical arguements.

What I do is offer my own opinion as it is. I believe it to be
> based on common sense but that in itself is just my opinion as well.

Agreed, opinon without support is not a logical arguement.  Neither is
it common sense, because an opinion is personal, whereas "common
sense" purports to be "common".

I don't think that's true at all.  Many intelligent people are still
rude.  Now you might be able to argue that wisdom and rudeness don't
go together, but that's an entirely different debate.
