Seeing as I didn't add my comments to the last thread I'll add them here. I
don't see anything wrong with it, you want to move to another server, you
pay the cost.

I like the idea of being able to move from one account to another, not that
I have 2 accounts but I can see that being done more than server transfers.

As for the charge, well, before you couldn't do it and now you can, if you
pay...seems fair to me <shrug>
People that don't think it is that important won't bother to pay out for the
transfer, those that do, will.
