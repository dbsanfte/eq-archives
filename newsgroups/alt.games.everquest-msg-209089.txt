Hi i have a 55 warrior quite well equiped and able to heal myself
quite well, (bind wound 80% and clikky heal bp) I was wondering if
anyone knew of any mobs i could solo for ex? as i often only have time
to play for an hour and by the time i find a group it's often not
worth the bother.
iIwas thinking maybe some dark elf or ikky guards as the faction wont
be a problem. TIA

55 dwarven warrior
ps i can also slow the mobs 50% hehe well most of the time.
