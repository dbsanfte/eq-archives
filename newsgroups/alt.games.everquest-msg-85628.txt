I have an old computer I want to upgrade.   It's no longer my main, so
I wanted to know if anyone had any experience running EQ with an AMD
Duran 1.1 GHZ and  512 ram?   (I am looking to upgrade this machine so
I can run a second EQ account.)

Can anyone tell me if EQ would still be playable with my original  TNT
video card with 16 MB or do I have to upgrade to at least a 32 MB
video card?   The second account would only have EQ Trilogy.

Any and all help appreciated.   Thanks.
