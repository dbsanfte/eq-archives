AAhaah actually though, that makes me think that sex should make a
difference too. I remember I played a fun mud before EQ and UO, one of
the fun things was that females generated mana faster making a high
elf female I had as a cleric a good one. It was fun because there was
a reason to be a different sex.

I don't know from gratuitous buffs because my "hot" female druid is
usually the one people are asking to "give" rather than letting
"receive." I don't think being a female character has helped me at
all.
