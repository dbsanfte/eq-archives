One thing you have failed to consider is reputation.  You don't
absolutely *need* to have friends in EQ to enjoy the game.  My Wizard is
level 48 now, and most of that was soloing, and I know how to get to at
least the mid 50s efficiently soloing (by "efficiently" I mean getting
XP at a rate comparable to what I'd get in a reasonable group).

However, there are many interesting things you just cannot do in EQ
solo.  Many things can't be done without several well balanced groups,
and if anyone in those groups screws up, the raid can fail.

If you want to eventually do those things, you don't want to be
remembered as "that guy who called the GM to make me share that Orc camp
at level 10".  The GMs can make others share an Orc camp with you now,
but 50 levels from now, that will NOT make someone let you go with them
to kill Cazic Thule.
