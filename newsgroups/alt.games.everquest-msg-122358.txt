I was able to successfully take a Level 1Halfling Ranger from Rivervale
through HHP and onto the NK Nexus spire using the innate hide/sneak just
after the Halfling Rangers were introduced.

I hid, checked external view to make sure it worked, then sneaked. The half
walk speed confirmed sneak worked. The Orcs and Gnolls literally walked
right over the top of him without any hassle, though it was a slow trip of
course....
