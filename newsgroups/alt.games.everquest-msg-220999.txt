In general, snakes kept as pets are not indigenous to the local area. 
When I did keep local snakes as pets, they were taken from the local 
population and released after several weeks...typically at the end of 
summer vacation. When I kept snakes as an adult, I kept rosy boas. Thjey 
will not survive in the wild in Connecticut past october or november if 
they do excape. Moot point. Still weaselwording.

If you dont take things seriously, then don't start arguments.
If you sound serious about something, people will respond seriously.

apologizing for not being able to snip enough to make my response as
