Bone chips and spider silks are a great source of money to newbies... sell
to PC's. 5p/stack for bonechips is a good price. Not sure about silks, but
you might get 10p/stack.
When youre level 24, you can farm karana bandits, and hand in the sashes to
chesgard sydwen in the qeynos paladin guild. This will net you at least
50p/hour, and being a mage will be great for lugging around all the bronze
weapons (dimensional pocket)
Summoned arrows will make you cash from time to time... advertise. I think
its level 20 for arrows.

I wouldnt waste too much time making money. A mage doesnt need equipment.
level up and then you can go kill HG for 30p a pop.
