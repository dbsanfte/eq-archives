Haven't experienced it yet but from what I've read the new petition
system is a nigthmare. The thread there asking for feedback on it has
NO positive comments about, not even from the fanbois. I doubt even
this will make them revert back to the in game system.

Then theres the whole Halloween/Kythrea(sp) saying the users should be
thankful for anything at all thread. While I did not see the part
where people are taking offense there seems to be at least 8+ people
cancelling their accounts. Wonder how many others aren't posting but
cancelling. Seems like Soe is trying to kill off EQ. I guess the
embarrassment of losing out to the popularity of WoW is taking its
toll. I don't mean to sound like I'm trolling with that statement. Its
just a personal opinion.

Those who leave will probally be back mind you but will Eq be there
when they return?
