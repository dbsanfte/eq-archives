I believe the value of the loot from the aqua goblin camps was nerfed some
time ago.  On my server, they used to always be camped by higher level
toons.  Now the goblins are never camped.

I found a good place for decent loot for low level characters was the newbie
zone in the Field of Bone near the entrance to the Iksar city.  The
scorpions frequently drop an item that sells for 5+gp (stinger or claw or
something).  Go there with a bag and you can accumulate quite a few quickly.
The downsides - the baby wolves like to gang up on you (even at level 2 or
3, more of an annoyance than a problem.  At level 4 or 5 they stop
attacking) and, if you're not Iksar, you can't run to the guards (the PoK
book isn't far, though).
