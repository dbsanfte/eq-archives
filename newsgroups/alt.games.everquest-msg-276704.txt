Not sure I really had a point.   As this was information that I repeated often
over the years, I just object a bit to characterizing it as a myth, when there
was ample reason to believe that it was true.  If I had access to a
Shadowknight and a Warrior, I could probably determine who was correct... but
having allowed my account to expire, I don't have that option, even if I did
have the desire. ;)

Honesty does however force me to acknowledge that much in the way "Alchemy was
never broken,"  statements by SOE reps aren't necessarily reliable evidence of
how the game works.  Especially when there is the possibility that the rep
never checked before conceding the point. (which he likely considered
irrelevant to the argument at hand).

I remember it being stated much more strongly than that.   At least in as much
as it was directly acknowledged, not ignored.   It has however been several
years since I read it, so my memory may be playing tricks on me.   And even if
my memory is correct, as I said, there is the good possibility that the rep
(TBH, I don't even remember if it was just a CS person or someone a bit higher
up, although I seem to remember it as higher up.)  never actually checked,
since he didn't consider it relevant to the argument over whether the exploits
and other such things really were exploits.

The only place it was posted that I remember was on Lum the Mad's site, so it
was lost when he took it down after being hired by Mythic.   His new site
doesn't have any records of the former site either.  (Not that I really
expected it to, as it is more focused on game design than the former self
described "rant site")


I actually remember that thread somewhat well, as I found it very interesting
at the time.   Perhaps because despite my extreme distaste for exploiters of
any kind, I came down on the guild's side that time.  EQ Raiding has always
seemed to operate within a sort of gray area, where nothing but an invisible
line separates exploits from strategies, as the developers try to add nasty
surprises, while the players attempt to innovate ways to deal with those
surprises.
