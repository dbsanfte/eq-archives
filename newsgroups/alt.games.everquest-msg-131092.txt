Well, since the poster I replied to was generalizing from his personal
opinions, and making a generalization that is totally at odds with my
experience (which counts hundreds, if not thousands, of players I have
interacted with as opposed to his unique perception), I felt that
emphatic disagreement was well warranted.  Your reply, on the other
hand, was not only insulting but exagerated way beyond any connection
with my comments.

And if you and Drywit are truly representative of the community, and
thus in a position to say with authority what is and is not rude, then
please explain to me why, for example, the second most common reply to
"/tell a_restingplayer_01 beg pardon, but might I pay you for a SoW"
is:
"a_restingplayer_01 tells you 'sure'"
while the MOST common reply is"
"a_restingplayer_01 tells you, 'no, but you can have one for free'"?

Keep in mind here that rudeness is defined by custom.  What you two
imagine custom ought to be is way out of sync with the overwhelming
majority of the player population.  Frankly, I don't give a shit if
one out of a hundred players might consider me rude for a few seconds
until they get thoroughly incensed at some ass who is sending them
six tells a minute begging for something and forget I even exist.
