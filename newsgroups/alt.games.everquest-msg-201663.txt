    Depending on the zone and the class, they could do OK. The ultimate
example of a class that would be just fine at 55 is cleric.

    You just answered your own question!

    They're already either empty or trainy hellholes, depending on which
zone you're talking about. Letting in more folks won't hurt at this point.
The mid-level guilds that aren't elemental yet are the ones most hurt by the
change, and they still have a very popular Tier III zone (Tactics) to go
play in.

    While I'd like AA points, friends of mine in the guild with capped AA's
and effectively capped AA's (they're buying useless stuff now, like CHA)
would see no benefit from them. A charm like the one I described would be
useful for almost all characters that could get it, as not only do 90%+ of
us not have a charm yet but the stats on the charm I described would make it
at the very least situationally better than any other charm available.

    Anyone who was going to buy LoY has it already. And if they don't, all
the stories about the stupidly rare drop rates on charms won't make them
rush out to buy it.

    Cringe. That bow staff sells for 30 to 40 K pp on Quellious. It looks
like someone whose guild just got into the elemental planes sold off a bunch
of "vendor trash" after raiding, as stuff like Air Mephit Blood just isn't
obtainable in XP camps.

    My most recent haul was two Nightmarewood Sap (Bazaar - 750 pp each
minimum, my price - 4.5 pp), some Thunder Etched Gauntlets (my price - 50
pp, I sold them that night for 1000 pp and was undercutting the next price
by a good 300 pp), and a bunch of minor tradeskill items like small pieces
of velium and hobgoblin meats. A lot of people don't know about the ten
hidden slots on a vendor, so even after the usual suspects have cleaned out
the vendors you can go dumpster diving and pick up some really nice stuff.
It's almost as good as when people without a clue sell stuff for below
vendor price in The Bazaar. My best pickup there, recently, was 28 Tae Ew
Rolls someone was selling for 2 pp each. They sell to a vendor for just over
19 pp each. ;-)
