This is like asking "which way do you visualize the days of the week
progressing, from left to right, or right to left"?  (dont' ask why, but in
my mind I visualize them right to left even though I've never seen a
calendar portray them that way). Not terribly useful information but kinda
interesting. It hadn't really occurred to me that it would be pronounced any
way other than like the pig. On the extremely rare occasions that I actually
discuss this with others (like my wife when she's on the other machine) I
usually just say "Spiritofthewolf" real fast.
