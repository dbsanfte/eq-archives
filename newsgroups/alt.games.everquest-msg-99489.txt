I know 3 people who have played on it and are returning to my server.
This is their concensus, it is the same EQ. If you have a problem, its
answered by a real GM/Paid empolyee(no guides) so CS is better but how
often in EQ do you really have a problem that you have to petition
for? If like me its next to never. The Gm event things are nice but
don't happen that much really, instead you have some changes which are
NPC (and probably going to happen to regular servers soon) like those
pirates in nro or oasis or something.

As far as loot, this is also mostly from the npcs that are different
and the returning 60 enchanter said this to me about why she came
back, "Its the same old arguements and disagreements over loot when
you kill something as it is here, only more so. The main difference is
I don't also have a bunch of people I consider friends to make it
better."

They said, like other servers, you have the full compliment of player
level ranges. It might actually be more enjoyable as a lower level
server than a high because as the enchanter found out anything high
you do, even if unique from regular servers, is going to require many
people and then you get into the "who gets it?" problems.

Honestly they may not have given it much of a chance. You can't just
expect to be thrown onto a server of strangers you have not built a
relationship with and for things to work smoothly. What you really
need is the opinion of someone who starts a totally untwinked newb
there and plays the game as it is meant to be played, just starting
out, and ask them for their opinion of it in about 3 months from now.
By then they will have formed a working relationship with like minded
low level individuals and it may be working out well for them.

From what I've heard you are mainly paying 39.95 for faster GM
response and a lack of volunteers who don't know jack, as well as some
different npc content here and there which drops some okay stuff if
you are untwinked and of an appropriate level. You will see some gm
things from time to time but they are not going to be ran by the fairy
of the Mony Haul who is going to shower you with loot for showing up,
some people have this misconception.

Even after hearing from them I'd try it out if I felt I had the 39.95
to gamble with. Currently I don't feel that way.
