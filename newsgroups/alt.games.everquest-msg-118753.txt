Thanks for your advice on Shaman/Monk.  Are human monks close enough to
being as good as iksar monks that it is ok to play Barbarian Shaman/Human
Monk?  I don't seen any big advantage of having an Iksar Shaman over a
Barbarian Shaman, but it seems that the increased healing rate might make
a substancial difference for a Monk.  I am not a big fan of playing evil
races (especially Iksar) but I want to be able to make it up to at least
lvl 45 without too many problems.
