I've been gone for around 1 1/2 years now and am thinking about returning.
Just bought NWN and that is getting my fantasy game blood going again.   I
was only a casual player and never got to high levels, but I'm wondering if
my character will still be there.  I know they used to say that characters
were purged after 2 months, but in practice, it never happened.  Did they
start deleting characters from inactive accounts now?  I had a 26 Enchanter
on Nameless ( I know, not really high level, but many hours for me).

Also, I've read about some of the changes, but does anyone have advice for a
returning player? (If I decide to return)

Thanks
