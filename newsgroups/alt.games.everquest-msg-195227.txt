I'll tell you how KEI changes it.  Druids and wizards can quad (and should
be able to ... perk of the class), but with KEI they're going to places and
pulling 8 - 12 mobs instead of 4, thereby emptying the place out.  I've seen
it happen at Ulthorks, Spirocs, Raptors, and Toilers.  A single druid or
wizard with KEI on strolls in and runs off everyone else by pulling every
mob out there.  The mobs follow the player around, line up line ducks, and
when one dies another steps into the void.

By the time the druid/wizard has regened their mana, the ground has
re-popped and they're ready to do it again.

When a single buff allows a single player to empty a hunting ground that was
designed to support multiple groups, the game is broken.  There's no other
way to describe it.
