Indeed. And anyone who's played EQ for any length of time should know that 
having most servers up while others are having some problems is a rarity. 
WoW doesn't have half the problems I've encountered while playing EQ, and 
the ones it does have are easily dealt with simply because WoW is such a 
great game. Patience is one thing I learned from playing EQ, and WoW hasn't 
even come close to trying that patience that EQ built up so effectively...
