Stolen from annother thread...

What quests are worth the effort ?
I noticed earlier today that Alla's lists over 2000 quests.
Yet there only seem to be about 20 worth doing.

From the other thread:

Reward quests :
Testament of Vaneer (sp?)
EB earring in Sanct Seru from the shissar guts
Gem inlaid Gauntlets
many of the newbie armor quests
Various Classes Epic.
Coldain Ring
Coldain Shawl
SkyShrine Quest Armor
Thurg Quest Armor
Rallic pack
Trueshot Bow (Rangers)
Nostrolo's Tamborine Quest (Bards)
Coldaine Prayer Shawl
Jboots
Stein of Moggok
Karana's Tear Earring
Staff of the Wheel Quest

Xp quests (low level)
Gnoll Fangs in Qeynos and Halas
Crushbone Belts and Shoulderpads
DF belt quest in the Warrior guild of FP
Rat teeth in kerran isle

Cash quests : 
Bandits in WK / Qyenos

So how many quests (and which) are actually worth doing ?

I think that there is a web page here "EverQuest's BestQuests"
Just a list of links to pages with the quest details.

Any more ???

Jim
