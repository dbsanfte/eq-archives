You make a good point Biz but after three years (make it two) it would
seem to me that Verant should mention that they were changing it.  I
know, they  have made changes in the past without notice. 

Let me also add that I bet that Verant knew they were making the
hornets a summoned creature when they first implemented the zone.
They are in Kunark (means they had a little more experince) and they
were probaably put there to satisfy the summoned creature crowd.  Why
does Ixiblat Fer who is summond spawn were the hornets spawn?


The was done recently and it seems from posts that it was also changed
in LS and who knows were else.
