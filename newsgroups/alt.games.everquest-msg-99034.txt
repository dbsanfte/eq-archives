Wow, guess I'll log in and check it out, but I'm not really excited to
hear this.  Guess I picked a good week to not play much.

Hmm, I really don't think I have a single non-proccing weapon.  I
generally use a Feverbane and my epic.  I swap out to a Flameweaver
when I need to work on 1hb, and that weird axe from Velks when I need
the extra AC.  Hmmmm, can't say I've done an all instrument attack in
many, many levels, but it may be a good idea.
