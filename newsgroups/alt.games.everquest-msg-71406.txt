A couple of hunting trips to the Arena is going to get your faction
to a LOT worse than dubious.   The 'right' answer is "run through Kael
invis with a friend who knows the way.   Nothing along the direct route
from EW to WL sees invis."

The second question was on whether it was safe to port to WL.
That answer is "no, if Woushi is up."   Better to just run through
camo'd with a friend who knows the way.   IIRC, though, Woushi
doesn't spawn for some hours after a patch.   So, if you time it
right, you can safely port in there right after a patch, run and
get the spells, then Gate or port out, avoiding everything but
the random "Look, something to eat" aggro you'd get in any
zone.
