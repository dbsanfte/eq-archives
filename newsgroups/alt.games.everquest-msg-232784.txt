Hello, 

Talking about maps ... Is there some way to get mapping for zones like
PoE, PoW or even VT and some more like this ?
I have, for instance, the plane_of_earth_1.txt file in my maps folder,
the colors are dark enough (thanks to Mappie) but well, it still says
that there's no mapping available for those zones ...

Is there anything to do against this or just have to do with this ?
;o)

Thank you for your time

Anaxis
