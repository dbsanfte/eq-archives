Ok, that's just odd. What that means is that some (desperate) girl 
picked up a phone book (or maybe checked the net) and looked up David 
freaking Navarro, figured that the one she found in the book was "the" 
David Navarro (because all celebs list their home numbers) then, felt 
that it was OK to call you at 2am just to see if you're having a 
"party". What's more, obviously she doesn't know David Navarro since 
she's looking him up in the phone book, yet, thinks that a random call 
will get her invited to this mysterious "party". People make me sad 
sometimes.
