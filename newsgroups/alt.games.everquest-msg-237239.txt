You might as well define God as "that which cannot exist" then.
It seems to be the only definition you're willing to accept.
Historically the word God could be applied in a much more liberal
manner, even to describe quite mortal beings that could throw
lightning bolts.

Does that mean you're a weak atheist(*) as opposed to a strong
atheist(*)?

I just can't conceive of any other way for the universe to exist.
Perhaps that's just my own simple intellectual limitation at work.

I don't believe in effect without cause.  That means I reject a
Godless universe where the Big Bang was the beginning of space-time.
Either the Big Bang was not the beginning of the universe, or the
Big Bang was an act of creation.  (By the way, for the record, I am
not a creationist; I believe in evolution.)

If the universe is godless and the Big Bang was not the beginning of
the universe, then the universe must always have existed.  However,
I have a fundamental problem with the universe having always existed,
unfortunately I'm far too tired to express it with any semblence of
rationality.  Maybe later.
