GOOD

don't waste your time

a better suggestion to you would be to stick to PoJ; the exp can't be beat
for getting to 52/53, and it's the only place someone of your level can be
comfortable without (frankly) riding anyone else's tab, so to speak

there's nothing wrong with that...just admitting that you can, should, and
will do the upgrade makes you a respectable warrior, and 925 isn't so far
off base at your level
