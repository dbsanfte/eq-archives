What struck me most about this tale from Bob is it's vast similarity to those
of Richards.  The next thing that hit me is the seeminly quite similar
nature of the end-games or near end-games of both EQ1 and EQ2, i.e. get a
gaggle of friends to go whack Foozle for some keen stuffs.  The only real
difference I can see is that EQ2 is making the players work harder for
"fluff", guildhalls and whatnot.  The access issues seem about the same
except it's Guilds that are camping guild xp for raid target access instead
of individuals in the guild camping say VT shards for VT access ala EQ1.

The more things change the more they stay the same it seems.
