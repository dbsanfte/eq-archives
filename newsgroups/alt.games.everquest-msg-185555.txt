What's worse is that I have to camp Targin in the King room for my epic 
(finally nailed, Raster, THANK GOD) and I can't handle that room solo.

Don't get me wrong, I could break that spawn and handle it nicely with a 
couple stacks of bandages, but not with a 400hp HTing SK kobold in the 
alley runners go to and a shammy that aggros from 2 rooms down.
