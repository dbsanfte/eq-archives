This is unrelated, but this kinda shit pisses me off. I'm a senior in High
school, almost 18 years old. I have to go back to school, and I'll bet you
the classes I'm taking are a lot more difficult that anything you took (3
college classes, including Calculus and College level British Literature).
Just because someone is in school doesn't automatically make them immature.
