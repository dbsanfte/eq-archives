1) The gardener and flowers exist in the same world as the real-world 
money. EQs game world, like monopoly, the game of life, and scrabble are 
supposed to be closed environments...per the rules of the game you 
aren't allowed to buy in game assets using out of game assets.

If your character hired them sure. But your character didn't hire 
them... you did.

That *is* the game however. You know that going into it.

What you are suggesting is that you (or snyone else with enough money) 
should be allowed to buy a place in the hockey hall of fame or 
something; after all its your money and its not your fault that the NHL 
chose to bestow that reward on people with an top tier team, talent at 
the game, and a huge block of time...
