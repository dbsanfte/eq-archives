You running a WinModem?
I suspect you might be because WinModems rely on the CPU alot more than a
std. modem. If your CPU is very busy loading zones etc then it may not be
giving enough time to your modem and causing the LD problem your having.
Try and get a non-WinModem from somewhere and see if it helps.

If you dont have a WinModem, disable any other apps running on the computer,
ensure all your drivers are up to date and see how you go.
