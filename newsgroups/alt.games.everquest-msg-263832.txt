Heh, never having been one to feel the need to wait for someone to actually 
*ask* for my opinion, I must say that it seems to me that both people 
involved were a bit over-sensitive here.

Paraphrased, of course...
Julie: Please don't talk to this moron.
Annie: I'll thank you not to tell me to whom I should speak.
Julie: Well, excuuuuuuuse me!

Both parties took more offense than was meant by the other and it has 
snowballed from there. A little perspective here may do wonders.
