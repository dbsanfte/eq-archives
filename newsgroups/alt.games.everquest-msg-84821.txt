Anyone remember that poll and other stuff they had a while back? I
think its been quite a while now but the poll asked if you could play
on a server where you got personal CS, GM interaction and events and
paid a larger monthly price like 30 odd bucks for it would you?
Evidently enough people said yes.

What you are mainly paying for is the larger amount of CS and GM
people and the server for 8,000 people or more to have their char
portrait and equip updated once per day (a bit like magelo but
automatic and also shows your char in what its wearing in the new
luclin model)

$9.89 kind of gets them squeeking by now which is why new content is
made as much as possible which you buy at the store. Their biggest
regret is that they did not go for a higher monthly charge. Even a
flunky GM makes minimum wage or more and a Verant staffer once showed
how if you take up even an hour of a customer service reps time during
a month, there went your $9.89 right there. 

Remains to be seen how good it is, but since they say that every six
months you'll be able to move from legends server to legends server
for free.. it sounds like if successful there will be more than one
Legends server set. I'll let other people beta test this because to me
it does not seem worth it for my 55 druid to move to a new server,
intact, and pay 29.95 more per month just so I see more GM quests
which I always thought sucked in the first place and get my char info
up on a website which I can do now with magelo. I don't even have
enough CS problems in EQ to make it worth that.

In order for me to see the point of that extra money, I'd need a
fundamental game improvement like you meditate and regen 1/4 or 1/2
faster or all mobs and dropped random good loot (based on their level)
instead of static camping. To just have the same basic game but with
more gm intervention, CS and a magelo char site ran by verant is just
not worth it.
