Do chests drop at the same rate no matter the mob?Or do some mobs drop 
chests more than others?
Why I ask is that my swashbucklers disarm traps is frighteningly low and I 
am trying to get it to a good level before I do any more grouping .I've been 
going after green mobs but the chests drop so seldom it is frustrating.Is 
there a place or type of mob I should look into?My character is 20th level.
Any help will be apreciated.
