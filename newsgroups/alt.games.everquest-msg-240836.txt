    I have to admit, it seems that Faeandar's logic is a bit weird on this
topic.  How many fully loaded corpses have ever poofed because someone was just
careless enough to die and then not bother to come back for the body?  Probably
a few, due to ignorance about the whole corpse poofing phenomena.  But I would
guess not very many.  How many corpses have poofed because the someone got
called away to military service, had ISP issues, or other real life concerns
that simply prevented them from coming back?  I would guess probably a few more
than the first scenario.  I just don't think that either scenario happens enough
to have that big of an impact on the dumbing down of the game.

   I'll tell you what I think is really going on.  I think that SOE is getting
ready to just do away with in game customer service at all.  You get stuck
somewhere?  Use the /rewind feature and hope for the best.  You die in a
horrible place with no chance of doing a CR?  Oh well, just wait a week and
you're body will turn up in the Graveyard.  Someone is screaming obscenities in
the PoK, or repeatedly training your group?  Fill out a little in-game tattle
sheet, and if we get enough of them we will soul mark or ban the account.  Or
better yet, take it to their guild or your community forum boards and let it be
dealt with on that level.  

   It's just a matter of time.
