Hmm I haven't been there since the revamp, but it used to be that
almost all trashmobs procced illusions. Was great fun having a group
of "mobs" fighting .. the other mobs. Models in GE used to be taken
randomly from the modelset for luclin. ie you could basically get any
luclin mob model in that single zone .
That alone made a trip to GE worthwhile. The beer goggles was another
but that was nerfed with the revamp I think. Still glad I got mine in
the few times we were there.

He has (90% of the time) a Divine Aura proccing hammer as weapon. And
yes as a npc he can still attack while DAed. As long as he's not
hitting (and thus proccing)  you can damage him. Normally we use a
kiter and loads of ranged damage to take him down. Wizzie with a flux
staff is great as kiter.

His drops are very very good for the effort IIRC (some clicky effect
item). We farmed this one for just about every cleric in the guild.
