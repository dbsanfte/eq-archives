I am absolutely thrilled that they set the prices at what they did.
Otherwise you would see horses everywhere.

And you can pick one up for around 8k for the slowest one.  And I hate
to tell you but take a look at the number of people on TP or any
server short of FV who are WTB Fungi Tunics and the like and you will
see a LOT of people with the ability to buy a horse.  Heck, at level
35, completely untwinked I have just under 20k in the bank and another
5k out in loans after a high of nearly 32k a month ago.  I will have
that cash for a while though as unlike so many people I know, I could
care less about a horse.

While I may not be happy about some other things they have done
recently, I applaud Verant for how they set horses up.
