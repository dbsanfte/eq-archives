Ahh the good old days....
Mindless trip down memory lane:
My first trip was from Qeynos to Freeport, because rumor had it that you could
buy and sell things in a cave in The Commonlands and I needed to buy a new
weapon.  I got directions from a guy in blackburrow.  Put all my stuff in the
bank in case I died.  The only thing I took with me was some food and water and
a rusty sword.  Ran through Qeynos Hills into west Karana south to the water. 
Ran along the water's edge to avoid most of the nasty mobs into the Karanas and
followed the water to the 2nd bridge.  (The first sight of those spires in NK
..  absolutely awe inspiring). Anyways made it to HHP where a kindly shaman
gave me my first sow and led me to the Kith Border.  We chatted until daylight
and then he gave me a fresh "sow" for the run into WC.  
As a ranger I was totally shocked and appalled that people killed bears there,
but felt much better once I realized that there was an overabundance which must
be kept in check.   (I know some rangers don't believe in killing bears, but
only the ones in Surefall are *forbidden* :))
And those huge spiders!  We had nothing like that in Qeynos that's for sure.  
I got bound in Freeport by some kindly spellcaster who refused my 3 plat
donation before returning to the "Commonland cave" to listen to the endless
auctioning. 
It was *so* exciting, the Commonlands remained my home for several levels. 
Plenty of animals to track and kill for their pelts, (it seems like I got a
plat a piece for them back then, but I could be wrong..)  I had a long standing
deal with one of the shaman there that I would sell him my pelts and he would
*sow* me for free.  AND he gave me a great price on a couple of those magic 10%
weight reduction bags to carry my pelts in!  
Life was good :)

Yes, kids have it so easy these days :)
