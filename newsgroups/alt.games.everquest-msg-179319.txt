I have a proto-tool I am working on in Perl that splits logs into one-day 
chunks.. I am also hoping to get it to the point where the program can 
manage a serverwide set of friends, keeping all your friends lists updated 
and in sync, as well as interfaces. 

I have dubbed it fippy, and if there's interest I might release it ;)
