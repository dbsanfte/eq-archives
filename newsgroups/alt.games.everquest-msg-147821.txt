This was by far the most fun quest I have ever done in everquest.  I
definitely recommend it.  No annoying rare spawn or rare drop type
components, just run all over the old world picking up rods off the
ground.  You will have a tricky time figuring out how to get that
lower guk rod.

As a wizard, one of the most important quests to do is the staff of
temperate flux.  It's a very important tool for most wizards.  But the
quest is rough and could not be done single-handedly at level 29.  Get
a group to help you out with that one, and you may want to wait unti
level 34, when you really start to make use of it.  Note: This quest
can be MQ'd, so if you have a higher level char, you may want to use
that char to get the two heart pieces.

Another type of quest you may wish to pursue is a faction quest. 
Arguably tedious, but still a change of pace that may be refreshing. 
As an erudite, I'm not sure which cities you could pursue faction-wise
or which would be fun to do, but it should be easy to figure out with
a little research.  Heck, you may hit two birds with one stone if you
go for Oggok faction and use that to do the stein of moggok quest.
