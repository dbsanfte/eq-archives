I would disagree there. Twinking still makes it possible to kill mobs 
much faster than the game was geared for, so you will suffer the same 
type of skill deficiencies to a point. The higher you get, however, the 
more they will catch up. Having twinked several characters, I always 
tried to use the strategy of loading up on AC/HP gear and getting the 
fastest weapons of each type (1hb, 1hs, 2hb, etc.) I could find (melee 
classes, of course). That let me swing more and die less. I usually had 
my weapon skills all maxxed for my level by my mid to high teens.
