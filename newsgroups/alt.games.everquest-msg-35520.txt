Don't know the formula but u could try using Copelands Weapon analyser,
Looking at the figures it gives it seems pretty accurate to me looking at
the figures it gives for me wielding Felhammer.
Can't remember where I D/L it from but you can get it here;

Strength does play a part but not that much, AC and health are more
important, you can't do much damage if you are dead.
Only worry about strength if it's so low that you cannot comfortably carry
your armour weapons and some loot.
