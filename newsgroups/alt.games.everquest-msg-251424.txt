   I would guess that the devs also consider this to be a bug.  Isn't the
whole point of beta to find bugs like this so they can be fixed?  I'd only

   Well, that different, I think.  Sounds like he was doing it on purpose,
just to get his jollies.  I admit, I wouldn't be eager to play in that
situation either.
