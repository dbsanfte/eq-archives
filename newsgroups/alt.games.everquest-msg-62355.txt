Leave ZA up at ALL times!  Turn off pop ups for alerts and the only
issue you'll have is when you get new .exes from patches.  This should
be a non issue based on my experience with all of my PCs that run EQ and
ZA.  Now if we were talking about AO or some other games it would be
different.  Freaking AO made me crash out and then manually authorize
new .exes with every patch because it wouldn't allow the ZA window to
come to the front.

Disable your windblows key via software or by getting a real keyboard. 
Real keyboards don't have such silly buttons on them.

Tell her to stop doing that or hook  the printer up to her PC.  Your
valuable processor cycles are needed to whack the bunny, they can't be
wasted on such frippery as printing her doctoral thesis.
