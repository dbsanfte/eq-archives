I think my favorite line in that rant is :

It's not all about you and how I hate you because you aren't in an uber
guild. Guess what, moron? I DON'T PLAY ON YOUR SERVER. I do not know, nor do
I give two shits about the status of the guilds on your server. >Elite
Cockjockeys< and >: Lords of Jizz< means exactly the same to me - NOTHING. I
rezz every single person I can, because I know exactly how much losing a
week's worth of work to something not my fault sucks. If I don't rezz you,
it isn't personal. So shut the fuck up about how I would have done it if you
were a member of >Dancing Dickbeaters<.

Hehe just my two cp.....
