I 2-box with a 2-boxing partner sometimes in LDoN, all 65s, me with
monk/cleric and the other either druid/enchanter or wiz/enchanter.  I'll
tell you what you already know, stay away from the collection adventures. 
They're just too random to guarantee a win even if you're doing everything
right, especially while multiple people are 2-boxing.

The difficulty of 65 missions is noticeably higher than 60 missions.  I take
my monk and cleric and invite random level 60-62 people sometimes just for
an "easy" run.  If you can handle the 60 missions with 15 to 20 minutes to
spare, you'll probably be able to handle the 65 missions after a few tries
to get used to the difficulty change.

You do have the option of leaving two characters under-63 and forcing the
level 60 missions even as your main two characters get to 65.
