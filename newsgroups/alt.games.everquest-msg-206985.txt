There ain't a whole lot more for a Warrior to learn until he's
learning details of target selection for particular zones/raids,
and learning when to use /defensive (L56?) and their no-fail
AE Taunt AA (L59+lotsa AA?).

basic MA/MT stuff:
(0) know how to hold agro:  dual fast weapons, use Taunt judiciously
(don't just mash it or it won't be available when you need it), stand
right on top of the mob, etc.
(1) call the incoming (incl. # mobs) before you bring the train to camp
(2) call a mob DS right away so casters can remove it
(3) call the assist with a different message from incoming
(4) if no mezzer in group, target healers before nukers before others
(5) let mezzer (if present) call targets after first
(6) once you've called the assist don't change targets

basic non-MA/MT stuff:
(0) know how to avoid agro:  have a good 2-handers, don't Taunt,
stand as far from the mob as you can and still hit it, etc.
(1) wait for the MA to call assist
(2) be aware so that you can tank mez when necessary (at which point
you revert to MT agro holding rules)
(3) move to the back of the mob as appropriate to minimize "push"
and mob dodge/parry/block/riposte during the fight (an awful lot
of melees seem to feel that Rogues smell really bad, or something)

All the basic stuff could be learned easily by a chimp of average
intelligence in ten minutes, tops.  So, with a few hours of practice
in a group any Warrior should have that much down cold.  And now that
KEI is out of the low level game, perhaps more than 1 in 10 will at
least have a clue by the time they hit 50.
