 From Casters Realm...

SOE is offering people who buy 'Lords of Everquest' a gauranteed slot in 
the eq2 beta.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I think this is terrible. If 
even one single person picks it up primarily for the E2 slot I'm going 
to be right pissed... and since I know its going to happen I'm going to 
get an early start :p

/longs for the time when companies thought of beta testing was an 
'expense' not a 'revenue stream'.

/wonders how long before SoE clues in that it could actually charge 
people the regular monthly fee to be in the beta....

"Be the first into Norrath 2.0! See the breathtaking landscape as you 
visit familiar places! Get a leg up on your friends and competing guilds 
as you get an advance look at the new creatures and quests. Nows your 
chance! Only a limited number of slots available in the public beta! Get 
a free gift when it goes gold*!! (regular charges of 14.95 per month 
apply, credit card required).

*A special coupon code for one free exlusive weight reduction bag will 
be made available to you after you purchase and register the full game 
when it goes gold. (Full game must be purchased separately.)
