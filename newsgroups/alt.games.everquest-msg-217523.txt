I just finished an LDoN collection where I was the lowest level in
the group (55 vs. 58.3 avg), I was the tank, half the mobs were
yellow cons, and the Druid healer had no trouble keeping me healthy,
in large part because the Enchanter did a lovely job of handling
crowd control.  I dunno about PoP, but in LDoN Druid seems quite
sufficient.
