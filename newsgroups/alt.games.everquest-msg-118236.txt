Get Focus Death ASAP. Your pet will thank you.

You're still too low for Unrest. I'd suggest the Warrens - you'll learn a lot
about pet control in dungeons, and when you run out of bone chips you just go
out to the Paineel newbie yard and stock up. You can sell to the druid in Toxx
and, eventually, you'll get enough faction to bank in Paineel.

If you want insane exp go to Kerra Isle and solo the entry mobs. There are two
at the tunnel exit and two in front of the bridge (you'll know what I mean when
you see it). They're on a 20 minute timer, so the trick is to split the spawns
so you're killing one every five minutes. You might need some help on the first
split.

Kerra Isle has a 20% ZEM, but terrible loot at that level. The kitties drop fish
and milk, though, so you won't need to go somewhere to resupply.
