I've been working POJ in groups and solo for quite a while, on and off, 
and since the patch noticed a difference in my ability to pull singles 
due to level.

I'll be specific: At 55 and under, if I went past the initial ring, took 
a right, and went to the first room, attacking either of the two sphinx 
I'd always get both, regardless of how far back I pulled with, whether I 
used sanre, stun, or a thrown axe.

At 56, I was able to get just one sphinx every time I tried it, the 
other one would stay put until I came back for him.

After the patch, still level 56, I'm back to getting both; at first I 
thought it was a fluke, but it happened three more times in a row, and 
again using each of my pull tools.

Now I don't think it was completely nerfed, because I didn't get rats or 
sentries adding even when pulling thru them, like I would when I was 54 
and trying this.

But I wonder if the level range you have to excede in order to single 
pull has been increased, either with just these two mobs, or just this 
zone, or in general.

Since no revamp of POJ was done, I'm suspecting it was a general code 
change.

I guess I'm looking for people in my particular situation; couldn't 
single pull one level ago, could with the next level on same mob, same 
spot, same technique: Can you do the same pull now, or are you back 
where you were a level ago?
