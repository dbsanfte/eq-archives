Hiya Ghost. Please dont take this the wrong way, or think I'm trying to sound more
"uber" than you...but take it from a lvl 60 warrior! Scrap dex. Its a virtually
worthless stat, as long as your base dex is 75 or better! Go with hps/stam first,
AC second and strength third....ESPECIALLY since you are a puny human! Trust
me...in the long run this will do a lot more for your character than the extra few
dex! I'd even trade those serp bracers for a couple FS or bronze ones, or save for
a couple crafted bracers! Remember...key is hps/stam, then AC, then str....hard
time goin wrong if you go that way!
