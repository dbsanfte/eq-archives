It seems with the new GUI there are Ogres running around everywhere. I don't
mind this, but I hate losing clurg faction. they attack you even if they are
green to you, and every time I turn around I lose the faction, I have been
tryin' hard to keep faction up, but as of late I seem to take hit after hit
after hit, even if just traveling straight through a zone and don't attack
anything  :(   Does anyone have any idea at all how to raise faction with
Clurg? I wanna raise it not lower it.
