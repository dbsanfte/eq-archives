From this newsgroup I gathered that Paludal Caverns would be a good place to
go for exp at 18 for my monk and boy were they right.  I'm now level 21 and
wondering where I should go now.  Should I stay in PC until 25, or move on?
If I should stay, where should I go after 25?  I had thought about High Hold
Keep, but faction work there might be a bit rough.

Thanks in advance.
