You can get xp off the GD giants, tho some (many/most? can't recall) of
the scouts will be light blue at 47.

Rather than PLing per se, if you want faction faster put together a
group and kill more giants.  A 47 Druid would be worth plenty to a
40ish group hunting there, 4 or 5 40s grouped with you could kill the
frosties at a fairly brisk clip.

The eastern zone edge is where I always solo'd, there are several
stretches where no wanderers path close enough to agro.  I'd say
your best bet would be to move around some so you can learn where
the mobs spawn and path.  It's not the best place for Druid xping,
but if you're after faction that shouldn't be a huge concern.  Also,
the giants drop heads and toes that you'll need for early steps in
the shawl quests.

I've heard that the ring war can be royally hosed by somebody doing
the wrong thing, everytime I saw one about to start the guild/alliance
doing it was practically begging everybody else to evacuate the zone
(most people did, it's hardly the end of the world to go somewhere
else for a while).
