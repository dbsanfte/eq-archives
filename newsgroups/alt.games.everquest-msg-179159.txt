Level 12 Lesser Summon Corpse. Works on folks level 1 to 35. Component 
is a Black Ceremonial coffin- for sale at most generic bag merchants. In 
Neriak, the lady over by the pottery wheel in the Foreign Quarter has 
them- for about 1.5pp each. These are giant size and fit into containers.

Level 39 Summon Corpse. Spell is dropped by a mob in SplitPaw. Works on 
folks up to level 60. Spell requires a Jade Inlaid Coffin, which is a 
two slot container. These are for sale in Neriak cleric guild, Paineel 
(not quite sure where), and in the Bazaar, and cost about 175pp each.

Level 57 Conjure Corpse. Spell drops from Juggs in Sebilis at minimum. 
Works on all bodies. Spell requires Tiny Jaid Inlaid Coffine- which is 
tiny and stackable, and fits into containers. For sale at same places & 
merchants as the non-stacking variety- so check with your necro to make 
sure you are buying the right kind.

Shadow Knights also can summon corpses, but I do not know at which level 
they may use these.
