Why would you need something on your body?

Only reason I can think of is so it will stay around for a week.  Are you
deliberately trying to litter?  Once upon a time, bodies decayed within
three minutes of death if they had nothing on them, but Verant anti-nerfed
that; bodies now don't decay until they become unresable, which is
to say three hours online and/or 24 hours offline (proportional, so
that 16 hours off and one on will do it)

But if you are jumping into the Hole to die, you won't be getting a res
at your new body, so what possible difference could it make to you
how long the corpse will last?
