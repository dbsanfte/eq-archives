Who on earth uses the word conflate?  Let me go look that one up.

Ah...I see how you could get that.  No, I didn't mix up attack speed and
weapon delay.  I referred to attack speed and said "therefore weapon delay"
because you can determine weapon delay decrease from attack speed and/or
damage output increase.

I do...do you understand what I mean though?

Show me where in the article he says he is talking about attack speed
increase.  He makes it very clear that when he uses the term "haste" he is
talking in terms of damage output increased, not attack speed increased.  He
comes right out and says haste is an increase in attack speed, but the
measurements he uses are in terms of damage output increase.  Show me where
he changes from that to measurements of attack speed increase, please.

Quote: "As far as EverQuest goes, Haste more accurately effects how fast you
attack."

Quote: "Haste is measured in Damage Increase, NOT Delay Decrease.  An item
or spell that adds a 40% Haste effect does NOT lower your weapons Delay by
40%, but rather increases the amount of Damage you do by 40% over a period
of time."

It's pretty straightforward.  It shouldn't be too hard to catch what he's
saying.  I see nothing anywhere else in the article where he changes his
viewpoint in this.

No it's not, because the measurements are quite different.  An increase of
20% in attack speed would not result in an increase of 20% in damage output.
He speaks in terms of damage output because he MEANS damage output.

No, it won't.  The internals of EverQuest are not quite that simple.  Other
variables will come into play and skew the two measurements off from each
other.  They are two separate measurements entirely.  They'll be close
(perhaps only several percentage points), but distinctly different.

Ben, are you ever wrong?
