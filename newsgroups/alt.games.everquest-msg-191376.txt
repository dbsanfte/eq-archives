Which part of THERE WAS NO IFS BUTS OR DOUBTS ON THE WHOLE SERVERS MINDS IF
HE OR WE KILLED THE FUCKING MOB did you not understand?!

This isn't a 1 group versus the other deal "he said she said", its an event
that I can name every single guild on the server who has passed it,
something you only need 1 brain cell to understand if non_guilded person has
the ring, and guild says he stole it, there is no doubt he stoleit.
