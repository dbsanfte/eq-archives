Would it not just be simpler to ignore an abusive tell - save you the bother
of answering it and would probably have irritated the hell out of the guy
who sent it as he must simply get off on irritating others. Dont forget this
guy probably thought going up ten levels at PC made him a better player.

Have KS'd others in error myself and anyone worth communicating with puts it
down as a mistake - the guy you were communicating with obviously needs
help..
