If all you want is cultural armor for your wood elf druid, please take
this strongly under advisement: BUY IT! Trust me on this: it will be
much, much cheaper to spend 1500pp (or thereabouts) for a full suit of
Fier'Dal reinforced than it will be for you to make it yourself;
cheaper and far less frustrating. Getting oak bark is a genuine PITA,
not to mention the hours spent farming skins and silks for components
to build your skill to the point of even being able to make the
attempt.

If you have a strong interest in making things that are useful, pick
up that needle and start stitching. If all you want is a particular
item, find a competent tailor who can make it for you.
