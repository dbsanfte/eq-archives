No, no no.  You don't get it at all.  That's just the whining of OH-pressed
sorts (i.e., those incapable of even basic survival without sucking on a
big ol' sugary tit furnished by Uncle Sam).  It's not like they're actually
doing anything for a living, so they have time to put out large volumes of
that sort of ill-informed, deceptive, "it ain't my fault, blame whitey"
twaddle.  All real persons know, of course, that we're God's shining gift
to humanity.

>Pawn to queen four. Check, motherfucker. 

Fell for that one again, huh?  I keep telling you, when I start with the
Polish Gambit combined with the Burmese Pawn Firesale, your only hope is
the Fernwaddle Defense Queen Slide, with an early Bishop sacrifice.  Now
your panties are flapping in the wind.  Again.  Queen takes Pawn, Check,
Mate in three (two if you do that dumbassed thing you usually do).

Can't teach these fuckin' kids anything.
