Potential newbie here and I have some questions before I make the decision 
to shell out some $$$ for EQ.

Due to RL (wife and 4 month old daughter) I cannnot get on as often as I 
like. An hour or two (total) in the evenings during the week and maybe 3 or 
4 hours on the weekend. The limited time, combined with what I have read in 
here about how difficult it is to get groups on some servers/in some areas 
make me hesitate before I pick up the game.

In all likelyhood (near certainty for the near and medium-term future) 
raiding will not be an issue for me. However, the ability to solo (or at 
the very least find a group quickly) is fairly important. Are there 
classes/races that can effectively solo or find groups rapidly?

Coming from another MMORPG completely (CoH), I am not used to loot. PLaying 
the schedule that I mentioned above, how likely is it that I would be able, 
as I level, keep my equipment level high enough that I am useful. (Note, I 
am not talking about raid-level gear or anything like that, simply gear 
that won't make people laugh tooo hard at me).

Thanks.
