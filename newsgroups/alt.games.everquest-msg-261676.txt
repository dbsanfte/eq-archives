I'm going to assume that they can physically refund the xp, because he 
did. I died at 4am, and got my rez the following day around 2pm.

I think he may not be authorized to give you a rez after the timer 
expired; unless it was a bug that caused the death.

Arguing that the rez timer itself is bugged is a legitimate gripe, and 
you probably could get your xp back... if you could prove that it 
expired early. (Is it possible that you spent some time at a character 
select screen.... that counts as being online and I'm not sure that its 
reflected in your logs?)
