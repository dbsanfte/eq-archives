Tactics, Time.  EQ has done it.  =)

Even you specifically compare this to an EQ issue.

EQ has gone through periods...  surely you remember the atrocious first
attempt at implementing DX9 (I *still* can't mouse target as good as I could
2 years ago).

The price of being first.  Do you need reminded of such patch message gems
as "due to an 'error' in the DB, Anguish has been re-itemized" (paraphrased
because I'm too lazy to look it up, internal quotes insinuated  =).

Major bitch target of the ToV-era.

Knight banned because the GM didn't have new models on and thought he was
runspeed hacking.  Well known example, there's plenty more.

That one is beautiful just in sheer carnage value.  EQ has had its share of
griefable bugs too (paladin AA that crashed zones was popular as a
"cockblock" method on my server for a while).

I think modern EQ is (relatively) stable, and that is a big part of its
appeal for the hardcore raiding crowd.  But looking at the history of EQ,
and acknowledging that WoW raiding *is* just getting started, I wouldn't try
to predict a 5-year view of WoW.

I guarantee SOE wouldn't agree with you.  =)  Their release got trounced
from all reports, and all they managed to do was cannibalize their own
existing userbase at the same time that it was taking an external hit.

I think Blizzard has made their fair share of mistakes, and is doomed to
make some more.  It's ironic that it's the very magnitude of their success
that is causing them the most problems.
