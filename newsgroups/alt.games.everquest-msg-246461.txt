Grouping, at its best, is fast, continuous action - mobs on a conveyor
belt, fun banter, friends made, lots of skill-ups and fast levelling.
Everyone wants groups like this, obviously.  You'd be mad not to!

...but if, for whatever reason, you CANNOT group, it replaces the 5
minutes of meleeing followed by 15 to 20 utterly boring minutes of
sitting waiting to get from 50%hp to full.  Not what you want from a
game of heroic fantasy.
