No. You can not use the stones to port yourself up to Hate. They are 
called "Cloudy stones of Innoruuk" or something like that, (I haven't 
bought any in a year, sorry, don't remember) and yes, they can be 
purchased in Neriak. Not very expensive.

They are the reagent required for a wizard to cast the spell Alter Plane 
Hate, which takes the wizard and his party to the entry spot in the 
plane of Hate. You will always need to be grouped with a wizard having 
one of these stones in their posession to get to Hate.
