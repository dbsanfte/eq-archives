This weekend my guild did a raid on KD. We had a MA who was a 58 lvl gnome
warrior who had like 3700 plus HPs (Gawd was he ubber.) Anyway during a
couple of fights I managed to catch agro and well being a ranger it hurt.

Here is my armory inventory

Lupine Dagger (1hp) procs greater wolf form (outdoors only)
LSOEE (1hs)
Ornate Runed Blade (2hs)
Swarmcaller (2hs) proc targars insects 50 percent slow
Ebony Bladed Sword (1hs) proc ensnare 58dd and root

I started using the Lupine Dagger in primary and LSOEE in Sec
after I caught agro the first time I switched hands.
After the second time I kept the LSOEE in primary and the EBS in the sec.
Again I caught agro so I switched to the ORB and did not catch agro the rest
of the night.

1) was it the speed of the lupine that caused agro in the first combo?
2) was it the ensnare that caused agro in the second combo?
3) was it not having a proc that kept me from getting agro in the last
armorment?
4) My Swarmcaller was in the bank but does Targars Insects draw agro as much
as the ensnare?

Thanks
Guylan 48 Ranger
Bertox.

KTF!
