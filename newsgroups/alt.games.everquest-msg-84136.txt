Besides that its impossible to review an MMORP in a valid way until
you've played in the world on a character for quite a long time. You
just can't see everything that is good about it or wrong with it that
fast. In single player games the reviewer ALWAYS finishes the game and
is reviewing the entire game. I've played EQ for 2 plus years and my
highest character is just level 56 so I've still not "finished" the
game even in the sense of max level alone. I do feel that I could
write a pretty valid review of Everquest though. I don't feel that I
could have said the same thing 3 months after I started playing but
these game reviewers base their review of an mmorpg on WEEKS or even
less playing.

I'd only really see a review of DAOC as valid if it was from someone
with a character of max level who had participated in every aspect,
including the realm PVP which is eventually the only point as far as I
know.
