Sorry.. plat sellers are legit players in my book. Want the mob, beat
them to it. You have as much of a shot as they do on a mob.

If you're going to try officiating based on "intent" i suggest you
break out the mind-reading devices. Since that is the only way you'll
know if that other player was looking to sell for plat.
