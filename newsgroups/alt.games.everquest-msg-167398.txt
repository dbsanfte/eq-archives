Hardly.  You start shit with me every chance you get.

You are one messed up individual.  The last time I posted we went
through this and I made my point that, you, post that crap about
*yourself*.

Feel free to look back over the google records, every time you've
gotten in to a long flame war with anyone your "personnal information"
get's posted anonimously.

Because you're the one that does the posting.  For what it's worth
bizbee, that "you posted my personnal information" is an old argument
that I won a long time ago...

Please do suggest that, bizbee.  I also suggest you do a Search on
"bizbee +flames".
