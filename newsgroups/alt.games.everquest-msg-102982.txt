Being as I don't drink alcohol on a regular basis...  My exposure to it was
about one poorly made drink and 1 sip of champaign.  Denial, no.  But I
hardly equate alcohol as a hard drug that makes a person literally need to
get a fix daily.

This, I am aware of.  Lots of things are hard to do, eatting less when you
know you don't need to eat in excess is also a matter of self control.

This is also a two edge sword.  Do you know not all homeless are drunks,
just that they are unable to afford a place to live in the area they are
currently in, or lack of appreciable work?  Are you aware that also, some
statistics are showing drops in alcohol-related driving?  And out of the
percentage of said issues, how many of those said accidents are due to it
being a person being a hard alcoholic?  Seriously, it is understandable
that Alcohol has physical effects, but to generalize it as a hard core
issue is to say anyone who drinks a beer, a mixed drink or so on is an
alcohol addict and will not be able to control themselves just having one
to two drinks.  And while Alcohol does impair judgement, I have seen people
who have been shitfaced before show restraint at other times.  I do not see
them hitting the bottle at every turn they can.  And yes, Alcohol is one of
major causes of accidents, but poor judgement is also one of the major
causes, and that often arises from being upset or under stress just being
on the road as well.

I guess you prove my point about assumptions.  I don't drink alcohol at
all.  Of the alcohol I had, as I mentioned was a poorly mixed drink and a
sip of campaign, and I didn't have alcohol until well after I graduated
from High School.  Since you assume I was "drinking in the parking lot", I
can assume you have been tokin weed when you were in junior high school, to
not realize that generalizing Alcohol like a hard drug, while it has its
physical effects, the effects I have seen has been pretty much one that
hasn't required a sense of self control.
