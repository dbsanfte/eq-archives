...I have everquest dreams.. probably every other (if not every) night.
SOMETHING to do with Everquest.
*sigh*
I'll wake up and I'll be sort of confused sometimes, because when I dream
about it, usually I'll either be in the game or creatures from the game will
have infiltrated OUR world, and all the gamers banned together to show
everybody how to kill them, or I got some special powers... SOMETHING from
the game always happens.

*twitch*

it's sad, really.
heh.

...it's also really sad when you and your significant other mess around like
this:

"hey, don't throw that at me.  You've already ruined your lands..."
"don't start."
"oh yeah?"
*smack*
"OOOHHHH Nicole hits Matt for 64 points of damage!"
"ohh you're goin down, woman."
"hahahah you wish"
*smack*
"woohoo!  Matt scores a critical hit! (95)"

*sigh.*
lol
