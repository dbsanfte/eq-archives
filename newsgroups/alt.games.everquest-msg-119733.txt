Get some haste... anything is good.

A Weight Reducing Bag (70% or better) is useful (will allow you more weight
for armour) and a Coin Purse (if you want to solo)

Lupine claw gauntlets are an easy quest... if you can find a werewolf.

Pick up a Polished Steel Ulak (or similar light weapon) for H2H practice...
should be fairly cheap, these days.

AC+HP rings, Orc Fang ears, Gold BP Choker for jewelry slots will see you
thru to 30s/40s

Don't overlook the newbie armour (human) and the shackle/headband/sash
quests.
Learn to bake (Fish rolls are still good Monk food and trivial is easy to
reach)

Save training points and cash for FD... 70 training points at lvl 17 is
easily doable, and should cost about 70-75pp to train (a starting FD of
around 80 will mean you should never have practice down-time)
