In Shadowhaven, on the balcony of the Inn/Pub-on-stilts
that's just east of the Bazaar zone-in point,
there's an NPC named Lewena.  When you hail her,
you get:

   Lewena says 'Hi there <yourname>, care to buy me
     a drink? If you buy me my favorite I will 
     tell you a secret.'

I've tried giving her every type of booze that the
nearby bartender sells, as well as other types that
I've found elsewhere, and even non-alcoholic drinks
in case Verant is being tricky (e.g. Flask of
Water, Bottle of Milk, etc.).

No luck.  Nor have I found this mentioned on any
of the EQ websites or forums.

So presuming that this isn't just this chick's way
of scamming free drinks, I'd like to enlist the
help of any volunteers to start trying different
types of drink on Lewena until we find the right one.

One possible clue might be that there's a brew barrel
on the same platform -- the key item might possibly
be a player-made drink instead of a storebought one.
