  I've played games where AC determined how difficult it
was for the mob to actually hit or miss with a physical blow, and
I've played other games where AC determined how much actual
damage (loss of hit points) you'd receive from a blow.

  My highest level EQ character is 51, and I still couldn't tell
you for sure what AC in this game does!
