I'll have to disagree with your basic assumption that there's no
downside to the way that WoW does it. For one thing, people solo so
much that their grouping skills are sadly lacking. The difference
between trying something relatively hard (like an elite instance with
mobs of around the group's level) in an pickup group or a group that's
used to working together is pretty dramatic. 

Also,most groups in WoW tend to be transient, often just grouping up
for one kill to finish off a quest. That tends to make it harder to
meet people, imo. Admittedly, it does have it's advantages. From what
I've seen, people are also more likely to take time out from whatever
they're doing and invest 10 or 15 minutes to help some random stranger
finish up a quest. 

Overall, I do prefer the system in WoW but it's not without a
down-side.
