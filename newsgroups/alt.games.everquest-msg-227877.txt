I could see where rooting him in the pit might be easier. My big
problem was that, sitting in the room beside the pens, the stampede is
so close together that I can't find and target the piggy. If you catch
him after they loop back around, things are spread out enough that
he's easy to pick out. I have seen someone reliably tag him as soon as
he spawns but I don't know how he did it.

Thanks for the info, everyone.
