Actually, I don't see any way the OP's idea *could* work unless they
wrote their own server-side code. That's the way I've seen it done,
anyway. The contents on the CD were only used for the art assets and
the client-side application - which is pretty much all that is *on*
the CD.

I do agree that the OP doesn't *own* the software, and is merely
licensing it, however, and this has been thoroughly debated here as
well as in the music-related groups, the principles of fair use *do*
apply. I really doubt that any attempts on SoE's part to shut down a
private server of this nature would bear any fruit beyond the effects
of financial bullying.

Lastly, "morally decrepit"? Come on. If we're going to start tieing
our views on morality driectly to what the law of the land states is
legal, we're in very sad shape.

I still don't understand the level of ire some people are exhibiting
here. Why exactly do you find this very notion so offensive?
