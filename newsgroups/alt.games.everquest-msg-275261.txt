** Welcome to Dragons of Norrath! **
---------------------------------------
A series of events has transpired across the world of Norrath and the 
familiar faces of Firiona Vie and her nemesis Lanys T'Vyl return to find 
themselves at the forefront of the events. Unbeknownst to them, a dark 
influence has seeped into the world of Norrath causing new tensions to arise 
and conflicts to intensify as the dawn of a new age emerges. The Age of War 
is upon the people of Norrath and heroes return in this ultimate, unending 
battle between good and evil.

Prepare for EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath and return to the lands between 
Halas and Lavastorm as you seek out the Nest, the ancestral birthplace of 
all dragons, long sealed away and hidden from the eyes of Norrath. But 
beware, if the Nest is exposed too early during the Brood Dawn, all dragons 
and their eggs will be cursed for eternity and death will storm down on all 
Norrathian's not in their service.

Featuring new lands with enhanced graphics, bold new storylines, and updated 
creatures including goblins, drakes, dragons and the ominous Frost Giant! 
EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath is the next great expansion pack for the 
fantasy saga that is EverQuest. Make ready with new features such as the 
interactive world map, use your potion belt to access magical items quickly, 
and swap between weapon sets using the bandolier. Plus, with the all new 
guild hall you can easily get your guild ready to encounter anything that 
comes your way! EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath is bursting with new 
adventures and intense battles for players of all levels.


** Features **
---------------------------------------

* Bandolier *
---------------------
To open the Bandolier window use the 'B' key.

The bandolier will provide you with a quick and easy way to wield your 
weapons in different predefined combinations. When a weapon set is 
activated, the bandolier switches the currently equipped weapons with as 
many of the weapon set items it can find in your inventory. To add a 
bandolier, first click on the slot that you want to fill. Then click the add 
button. You can name each set. The weapon set that will be saved as the 
weapons you currently have in your inventory (primary, secondary, range, and 
ammo slots). You can make hotbuttons out of the weapon sets for easy, quick 
swapping.



* Potion Belt *
---------------------------------------
To open the potion belt window use 'shift P'.

The Potion Belt allows for quick use of inventory items, such as potions or 
magical devices. To add a potion belt enabled item to the potion belt, 
simply put the item on your cursor and click in one of the belt slots. Then 
simply right click on the item to use it. Please note that not all clickable 
items are usable from the potion belt.



* The Barter Zone *
---------------------------------------
The entrance to the Barter Zone is in the western section of the Plane of 
Knowledge. The default in-game map has the location marked on it (this may 
not be true if have a custom map). To setup your character as buyer, use the 
/buyer command to bring up the Buyer Barter Window. When you'd like to sell 
an item quickly without heading to the bazaar, use the /barter command to 
bring up the Barter Window. Please refer to the context tips or the manual 
for more information.



* The Guild Lobby and the Guild Hall*
---------------------------------------
The entrance to the Guild lobby is also in the western section of the Plane 
of Knowledge. The Guild Hall entrance is at the back of the Guild lobby 
accessible by active guild members.

Guild Lobby:

- Looking for Guild and Looking for Guild Member tool: You can use the 
looking for guild tool or the looking for a guild member tool by clicking on 
the note boards. In the Guild Lobby use your map to find the note boards.

- Corpse Summoning: Speak to a Disciple of Luclin. This Disciple can sell 
you a level appropriate soulstone. Take the soulstone to a nearby Priest or 
Priestess and they'll summon all of your existing corpses in Norrath 
directly to your feet (except those corpses that are in Shadowrest). Be sure 
you loot your corpses quickly because they won't be there long!

Guild Hall:

- Guild Portal: The guild portal is activated by speaking to the gnome in 
the Guild Hall. You will need to purchase a focus stone from him and then 
hand it back in order to focus the portal on a specific location. Once the 
portal is focused, step on the crystal platform to bring up a yes/no dialog 
box. Clicking yes should teleport you away.

- Mana/Health regen pool: Walking into the back right room in the Guild Hall 
will cause you to regenerate health, mana, and endurance at twice your 
normal rate. You should see a text message when you enter the area of the 
pool as well as a particle effect on your character.

- Buff Timers: Buff timers are paused while in the Guild Hall.

- Guild Tradeskill Objects: Various tradeskill tools are located in the 
Guild Hall for easy access by guild members.

* Missions *
---------------------------------------
Mission givers for Dark Reign and Norrath's Keepers can now be found in 
Lavastorm. These mission givers offer quests for groups of 3 to 6 players 
that take you into the Dragons of Norrath. Only a few missions are available 
at first, but as you gain faction and earn their trust, more missions will 
open up. Missions make use of a new shared task system that shares space 
with the Task window (Alt-Q). You can manage the players in your shared task 
from the new Shared Task tab in the Task window.
Successful completion of a mission will reward you with crystals that can be 
redeemed at mission vendors in the two camps. Each side has their own 
crystals that they award and their mission vendors will not accept crystals 
from the opposing side. You can create stacks of crystals for trading to 
other players by clicking on the crystals display in the inventory window. 
The reclaim tab under the crystals display will add any crystals you have in 
your inventory. You can only spend crystals that are listed in the display, 
so be sure to reclaim before visiting a vendor.




** Live Patch Information **
---------------------------------------

The EQ Mail System!
----------------------------------------
EQ players now have the ability to send persistent messages to players who 
are not logged in! To use this new feature, take a look at the new icon that 
has been added to the window selector. This icon will change color when you 
have unread messages. It also blinks for a short period of time when new 
mail arrives. To open the mail window, click on the icon or use CTRL-M. 
Here's a few other helpful hints.

Sending Messages - To send a message, press the "Compose" button. Enter the 
character name of the recipient in the "To" field, a subject and the message 
itself. Press the "Send" button and mail icon of the recipient will start 
blinking! Please be aware that you can currently only email one recipient at 
a time.

Receiving Messages- If you are online, new mail is delivered to you 
immediately without delay. When you open the mail window, the number of 
unread messages is put between square brackets close to the "Inbox" list 
title. In the mail window, your messages usually appear sorted by date. You 
can click on the column header to change the sort type and order. You can 
also resize the width of a column with the mouse, just click and drag a 
column header separator.

Viewing Messages - To view the body of a message, select it in the list. The 
message text window displays the message fields in a different color, 
followed by the text of the message.

Managing Messages- When a message is selected you can reply to the sender or 
forward the message to another player by pressing the corresponding button. 
An appropriate default subject will be inserted for you and a copy of the 
original message is added to the mail composition window.

Deleting Messages - You can also delete messages, in which case they will be 
placed in your "Deleted Items" folder. To select multiple messages for 
deletion you can use SHIFT-click and CTRL-click. The "Deleted Items" list is 
where your deleted messages go. The total number of messages in that list 
appears in the title. Two additional actions are available to you when 
managing your deleted messages: you can restore deleted messages using the 
"Undelete" button, and you can permanently delete all the messages by click 
on the "Empty Trash" button.

NOTE: You can send a message to yourself. You can also send a message from 
the command line using the "[mailto" command. Syntax: [mailto <character 
name> <subject> <text> If the subject contains whitespace, you must enclose 
it in double quotation marks. Example: [mailto LadyCandy "You are so sweet!" 
Dear LadyCandy, etc. etc.
