Brad,

> That is part of the justification, yes. As for players using similar
tactics on Vox and Nagafen, we are aware they do, and my understanding
is
that players are warned for it, and repeat offenders are suspended.
There
is an important difference here, however: Vox and Nagafen have been
done
many times. What you were trying to do has not. Therefore, if you were
to
accomplish something this rare and difficult by exploit, you are
cheapening
the game for others far more than someone exploiting Vox or Nagafen.
This
fact influenced the severity of the punishment.

With all due respect Brad, if there is ever any disciplenary action
taken during these encounters, it is extremely rarely. We feel that
the target monster is irrelevant if you are going to be applying
punishment to tactics used to defeat them. In short, you should punish
all instances of a given tactic that you deem illegal, or you risk
condoning their use by inaction, which is what we feel you did. It
would be very difficult for you to argue that these instances are
difficult to detect, because both Vox and Nagafen are killed within
hours of the conclusion of each patch. Given the relative commonality
of these kills, it's impossible to say that they aren't being punished
because you don't know when or where they are happening.

 etecting spell stacking is far harder for GMs to do than detecting
safe
zone violations. In fact, had Kendrick and Jeff Butler not been
watching,
this aspect of the event might have been missed for a while (they were
more
familiar with the encounter, the details of the dragon's breath
weapon,
etc.) So, unfortunately, punishment for spell stack exploitation
probably
does occur less often. This doesn't make it any less of an exploit
though,
and quite simply, it allowed the tank and others to deal MORE damage
during
the encounter than they were supposed to and receive less. This is why
you
were able to kill the other warders and get as far as you did with
this one
with FAR fewer players than the encounter was designed for.

Our argument here isn't that the spell stacking conflicts are missed
because they are difficult to detect. Our problem with this statement
is that spell stacking conflicts have been *applauded* by SOE
employees, thereby giving them legitimacy in the eyes of all who play.

>This really is the key here, guys. These encounters were designed for
60 or
so players, and you were doing pretty well with 28 or so. Couple that
with
the fact that these encounters hadn't really been done before and are
still
very exotic (you guys knew this, which is why you were all so very
excited
to do this -- bragging rights, and such). This is why the punishment
was as
extreme as it was: multiple exploits used to prevail over some of the
most
exotic encounters in the game that are attempted VERY rarely. And it
remains our opinion that exploiting these types of encounters severely
cheapens the game experience for others. So we came down pretty hard
on you
all.

We again think that the rarity of the encounter is irrelevant. If you
are going to apply the rules, the rules should be applied consistently
and regularly. The simple fact that they are not applied consistently
and regularly significantly weakens your argument. We do agree with
you that the punishment was, in your words, "extreme", and that you
"came down pretty hard on" us.


>1. You knew the spell stacking bug was an exploit and planned ahead
of time
to use it
2. You knew attacking the mob conventionally ('zerg'ing it -- I like
the
Starcraft reference  would require 60 or so people, which, btw, is
pretty
close to exactly how many players the encounter WAS DESIGNED FOR.
3. You imply that Itzlegend in general uses pathing bugs as tactics

We regularly use the terms, "exploit", "sploit", and "Itzploit" to
describe tactics in the game that we feel are unique, and are not in
regular use by others. Given this recent turn of events, I have a
feeling that this habit will change.


>4. You used a safe zone prior to combat to position the target mob
where you
wanted him, and to allow you time to logistically set up your forces
5. You used a safe zone during combat such that your primary healers
could
only be summoned every 10 seconds or so as opposed to being melee'd.
This
gave you time to preemptively CoH and res people out of danger. Had
the
target mob been able to reach your forces under the bridge, the combat
would
have worked very differently.

I think it's obvious from our conversation here that we were unaware
of the "safe zone" effect of our positioning. We think you will also
agree that its benefit to our attempt was extremely minor. I refer you
again to your previous quote, "I can only conclude that what you did
in your minds wasn't exploiting a safe zone."

>6. You used a spell stacking bug to avoid the major effects of the
target
mob's area effect breath weapon, allowing you, amongst other things,
to deal
MUCH more damage over time to the target mob than was intended.

We have never disputed this, and as you say, we freely admit to it. We
did not think this was as big of an issue as it is, since, as we have
said before, similar conflicts have been used before, communicated to
GMs, yet no action was ever taken. A prime example of this is
Yelinak's AOE. As it began, Yelinak's AOE could be overwritten by
Clarity. Players used this every time they fought him, and SOE
employees were aware of this, yet no disciplenary action was ever
taken. The only thing that happened was that the spell was changed so
that Clarity would not overwrite it.

people
anyways'

This is another exchange where I can use the Yelinak example as an
explanation. Yelinak's AOE was overwriteable by Clarity. This was
never punished, though it was known to SOE employees, instead the
spell was merely changed in the next patch. That is what we were
referring to for the lion's share of this exchange. As for Kaetlyn's
comment, LOS isn't significant, Rez, we have already dealt with,
Pathing refers to holding the monster in place, which we have already
addressed, and Agro refers simply to aggro management, which we think
is the key to most high level encounters.

> 1. The encounter in question is supposed to be one of the most difficult
encounters in the game, designed for 60 or so level 55+ players, and
could
even semi-accurately be described as part of the game's 'end game'
(were
such a description valid for a game we keep adding content to  
2. You knew this was a very exotic encounter, and you planned ahead of
time
to use exploit(s) you knew were exploits.

With these statements, you infer to us a level of knowledge of what is
and is not acceptable that, by SOE's uneven application and in many
cases your nonapplication of discipline, is simply unreasonable to
infer. It is because of this that we feel the punishment is more
severe than our actions warranted.

We have been extremely straightforward during this conversation, and
we appreciate the dialog, and the chance to explain our side of the
story, and yes, argue our points. We are also gratified that this
incident has given you pause, and provided an opportunity for you to
reevaluate, and possibly improve your communication with the community
when disputes like this arise. I have no doubt that you will correct
the inaccurate statements that you made in your public response, and I
personally thank you for having put so much time and effort into
researching this issue with us.

We would like to again request that you reverse your decision to
disband the guild, since such punishment is reserved for, in the words
of Michelle Butler, guilds that "have a history of problems on their
record". I'm sure we can all agree that Conquest does not have a
history of problems on its record, and that reinstating the guild
would be an appropriate gesture of goodwill.
I think we're down to this, then:

1. We both agree that you used 2 exploits
2. You didn't think they were a big deal, and felt you get mixed
messages
from us on how serious or not serious these exploits are perceived by
us.
3. We feel that the context of the exploit (who is doing it, where
they are
doing it, and to what end) should influence the severity of the
punishment.
You don't, and think it should be uniform.
4. We feel several things said in guild chat imply that it is often
your
modus operendi to use exploits. You feel we are
misunderstanding/taking out
of context what was said.

I do appreciate as well the time you've taken and the civility and
respect
used in these email exchanges. Unfortunately, I still do not feel
inclined
to reverse anything for the reasons I've stated. Especially since I
feel it
is extremely likely that you used these 'tactics' on the easier
warders and
have the treausre from these encounters. It has crossed my mind that
were
you in good faith to return those items, we'd reinstate the guild.

I do need to make a public statement soon regarding our more detailed
investigation, and hopefully our exchange with you. My idea is to
include
the last 2 or 3 email exchanges between us in the statement, and I'd
like
your permission to do so. Barring that, I'll just have to post my
messages
to you, but none of your comments, which might appear one sided.
Please let
me know if this (posting both our coments) is ok. We'd also replace
any
guild member names with Guild Member #1, #2, etc.

thanks,

-Brad
