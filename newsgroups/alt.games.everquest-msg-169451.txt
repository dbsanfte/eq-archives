Interesting story heh.  I dunno why Prexus has what it does (or maybe its
just the norm?) but it has 2-3 Japanese guilds that I mentioned, a long time
ago the 4th or so biggest guild on the server was predominatly Korean.  We
have a pretty largue Aussie contingent too, they've been clearing NToV the
last 5 months or so.

They say many things, a lot thats just not guessable let alone
understandable... sometimes you get a reply along the lines of "sorry bad
english me"... I've had very few run-ins with them though, so its not often
been a problem.
