What you describe is almost the exact same strategy I used to get the PP.
He is stunnable; I had a pally chain-stun him and it worked great.

The only difference is that I turned in the item, then cast DA.  Also, I
made a couple dozen "practice runs" so I could get intimately familiar with
the route to the zone.

I did it with a group of six in their low 50's, and he was no problems.  He
has a lot of hitpoints but is still relatively easy as your epic mobs go.
