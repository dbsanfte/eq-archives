The alligator skin is pretty rare; I think I killed about 30 before one dropped
for my halfling, and close to 40 to get one for my rogue. A guildmate sixed a
bunch (hunting the shadowed men in Innothule, I believe) and got one in maybe
25. They are the 'bottleneck piece' for the quest (that one item that is
exceptionally hard to get) so expect frequent disappointments.

As for the weapon you use, SUPPOSEDLY drops are spawned with the mob and it
doesn't matter who kills it or what he uses. If you are more profficient in 1HS
or piercing, by all means use that weapon.
