>From the original post:
"Players who want to play on those servers will have the opportunity to
transfer over to the "Exchange enabled" servers for free on a
one-time-only basis (but you can't ever move that character off these
servers)."

That would imply that once you're on an exchange enabled server then
you're stuck there.
