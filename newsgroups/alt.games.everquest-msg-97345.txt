Healing is simple:  Heal as late as possible while leaving
a safety margin for fizzles and adds and just plain bad
luck on the RNG for hits.  That's going to be around 40%
most of the time until around the mid-40s or later, where
it'll drop to 30 (or lower.)

The only other thing is:  you don't know where "as late as
possible" is when they're pulling.  A few stuns on the way
back, getting an add (or two), and the puller's health can
plummet VERY quickly.  I generally keep the puller at 80%
(or more) and always have.  It's fairly easy, actually, to tell
when the fight is almost over and to heal then simply by
using an /assist hotkey on the person taking the most
damage.  The first /assist will let you target the mob; hitting
it again gives you the mob's current target.  That shouldn't
be switching (although it will in the early levels a LOT.)  Wait
until the mob is at 20% and sneak in a heal then on the puller
if it's needed.

There isn't a "dwarf only" disciple (or initiate) line.  That's for
the god Brell and shared with Gnomes, his later (and better)
creation.

Groups need to know when you're getting low on mana or
going out of mana after a cast.  That's what makes the
difference between running to a zone and living and dying
in place.  So you need to tell the group when you start
getting concerned about your mana and keep telling them
until it changes.

Other than that, they want to know if they can pull something
else to kill.  After a few fights, you should know if you have
enough.  The -easiest- way is to simply ask them to "hold pulls
while I get some more mana" or tell them "you can pull one
but two will kill us" or things along that line.  After all, they
don't know what YOU can do with "40m."   A 25 cleric with 200
WIS and 200 additional mana is in far better shape at "40m"
than a 28 cleric with 150 WIS and 20 additional mana.  Make
sure you actually communicate "40m is okay to pull" if it is
and "don't pull when I'm below 60m" if that's what's needed
for safety.   You're going to get blamed (in general) if you run
out of mana during a fight so make sure they know what YOUR
comfort level is.
