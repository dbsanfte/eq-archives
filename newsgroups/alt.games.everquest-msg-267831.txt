Well, yes and no.  Think about what gets discussed on the newsgroup.
A lot of it involve where to go, what to do, how to do it.  It's bad
enough when those questions make no sense to one segment of the
community (e.g., when someone asks about citizenship quests or heroic
opportunities), but it's in some ways worse when the question makes
sense but the answer depends on which game you're talking about (e.g.,
which classes make good soloers).  If a newbie shows up and asks, say,
"How do food and drink work?", the answer is VERY different depending
on which game is meant.  (At least, that's the impression I got from
an answer that I think was EQ2-based.)

The fact that the games DO share some lore is actually a minus.  If I
see a post with the topic, say, "need help with Freeport quest", or
"druids nerfed?", I have no way to know if it's EQ1 or EQ2 without
reading the post.  (And sometimes it's not immediately obvious even
then.)

That said, I'm not especially in favor of a split.  My reason is one
that's been stated by others: I think some a.g.e regulars -- especially
those who have stopped playing EQ1 and are trying EQ2 -- will give up
reading a.g.e and read only a.g.e2, and that the EQ1 a.g.e. community
will be poorer for that.  But I do think it would help a lot if people
would label their posts (and I'll even try to remember to include EQ1
in my posts :-) to make it easier to filter out unwanted topics.

Anyway, though I'm not in favor of a split, I'm also not vehement about
it.  If a new group gets formed, so be it; I'll just hope that the
seasoned EQ1 players continue to follow this group so I can keep picking
their brains!
