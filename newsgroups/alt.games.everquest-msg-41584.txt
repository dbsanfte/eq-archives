Warrens and Stonebrunt Mts are excellent exp and decent loot you can be
bound in Paineel right outside Warrens. There are some decent low level Monk
Items in Warrens Kobol Pit Fighters. Monks are in big demand as pullers in
Stonebrunt Mts due to the heavy wandering agros. Edurian has full banking
and vendor services and in a few days of killing Kobols you will be able to
enter Paineel. You should be able to get Wu's armor (guants) on Prexus a
full set of Wu's Fighting Armor goes for about 300p 13 peices.
