Hi,

My Wizard has been working on raising his skills in Specialization
Evocation.  He has been casting a level one spell on himself over and
over to do so.

He was using the level one spell Shock of Frost.  This was working
but it was a pain, because of the small amounts of damage that he
was taking.  (They do add up.)

I then tried using his level one spell Frost Bolt instead.

When he casts Frost Bolt on himself the spell goes off, but he seems
to take no damage from it (I am assuming that this is because the Bolt
spell needs to have a direct line of sight to the target in order to
hit it, and he cannot see himself).

My question is, will he still be able to see an increase in the skill
(Specialization Evocation) using the Bolt spell on himself in this
manner even though the spell is not hitting the target (himself)?

When he casts the Bolt on himself he does use up mana, and the spell
appears to go off.  But the Bolt never hits the target (himself)
or causes damage (to himself) because (it appears) that the spell has
no direct line of sight to the target.

I am asking this because I have not yet seen an increase in the skill
using the Bolt spell, but I have seen one when using the Frost Shock
spell (which causes damage). 

It does not seem to me like the chances of seeing a skill increase
would be dependent upon the spell causing damage, but rather on
successfully casting the spell.

I thought of using the Bolt spell like this, in order to avoid
taking damage while raising my skill.  But I don't want to waste
my time and mana casting it over and over like this, if it will
not result in skill increases.

(I have cast it 179 times thus far without an increase, but I know
it does take a long time to see some increases)

Have any of you Wizards out there used Bolt spells in this manner
to increase skills in either Specialization Evocation or Evocation?

Should I go back to using Shock of Frost (and take the damage) or can
I expect to see skill increases using Frost Bolt like this?

Does anyone here know for sure?

Many Thanks.
