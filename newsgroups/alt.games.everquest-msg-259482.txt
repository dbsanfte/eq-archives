Well, I loaded up the Omega drivers for this ATI Mobility 9600 and I
think there is *some* improvement but it's not fixed.

When I first enter the world the display is ganked, but <alt><enter>
takes care of it, whether I start in windowed mode or full screen.
Oddly enough all the displays up to entering Norrath look great.

Once in and the display is good, performance seems to be ok when
anywhere but PoK.  This is not unexpected in some cases but I would
think a 1.6GHz, 1gb RAM machine would be fine in PoK.  Also, when I
loot a corpse it slooooooows way down.  Mouse gets almost unusable and
everything starts jumping.  But if I open a window like options it
seems to have no adverse effect.  I think it's specifically the
inventory screen.

Any ideas?  I gotta say, all in all this laptop is bugging me.
