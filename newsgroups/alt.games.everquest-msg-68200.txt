It just depends on the methods used. I PL my alts quite a bit. I just use my
druid for melees (and casters up until a certain point) and the skills keep
up. I haven't had any skill atrophies, and with casters, I just took a
couple days off to macro cast to skill up with it. And too, with my warrior,
I had neglected 1hb for lack of a 1hb weapon, so during a camp I brought a
CoT and within about 5 hours (and no point inserts) I had about 200 in 1hb.
If you stagger out the lvling a tad (but still keep at an elevated rate) the
skills don't lack.
