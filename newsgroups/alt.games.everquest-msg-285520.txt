In which case, the price you pay is the annoying patch process and bad 
communication.  See, I'm not forced to read your posts here, but when I 
do, they annoy me.  You're not forced to read the web page, but when you 
do, it annoys you.

You could just wait for the estimated 8 hours doing something else and 
then log in, or you could read the Sony boards for a bit and learn some 
stuff about the game or provide some learning to others.

But instead, you insist on beating your head against the wall.  So I 
insist of beating my head against your wall.

Neither process adds any value.

Read the Sony boards, they're usually pretty-up-to-date with how the 
patch is going if it's beyond schedule.
