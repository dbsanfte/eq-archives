    I think the way sony look at it, warriors can be as hopeless at soloing
as all get out and still always get groups because they ARE the best tank.
Even if they utterly sucked at group-tanking, which they don't, every guild
that even aspired to raid capability would be sponsoring warriors. Ditto
clerics and ditto enchanters. Other classes need more going for them because
they're less likely to be sponsored from the ground up for their raiding
powers.

Cheers,
James
