Restrict mobs to certain areas. Mobs still rely on pathing to get from
any given point A to point B. If their pathing only covers so many
quadrants, or only certain restricted parts of a quadrant, you suddenly
become capable of escaping a mob.

What about figuring out a mobs pathing limit, you say? Maybe exploiting
it by taking aggro to it's pathing wall, then just shoot at it from
there? Easy - a soft pathing barrier, where if you do not continue to
attack, the mob stops following and walks away. If you continue to
attack, say with a ranged weapon, after passing this soft barrier, the
aggro is refueled. So long as you are outside the soft barrier, aggro
slowly fades, only increased per attack. Run away outside the soft
barrier long enough and aggro eventually fades to the point the mob
walks away, leaving you alone.

This could lead to new types of kiting, but nothing we don't already
see with fear kiting, feign kiting, and zoneing out, then back in to
whack some more on the mob you wanted while the adds continue to walk
away.

This also opens the possibility of aggro kiting very high-level mobs to
areas they should not be. BUT, if you allow the aggro modifier while
outside the soft barrier to go below what it normally would, you could
potentially have, say, a sand giant get kited all the way to the newbie
zone outside Freeport. Ohs nos! But because the aggro counter is going
below normal for being outside it's normal sand dune home, only the
person who kited it from there has any sort of aggro. Low level
characters who might otherwise be at severe risk know only that some
dumbass Guy Fighter got stomped by a sand giant right outside the city
gates. After killing Guy Fighter, the sand giant peacfully makes its
way back to the dunes. Only untill it gets back inside its soft pathing
barrier will it's aggro jump back to normal and squash any low levels
stupid enough to conga-line behind it to it's home.

Also, I would like to see some sort of movement penalty for going up
steep inclines.
