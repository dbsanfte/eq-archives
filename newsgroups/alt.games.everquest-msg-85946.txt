Another thing that works reasonably well is to get everyone
in your guild to spam the sleeper with repeated tells,
and at the same time everyone standing near the sleeper
repeatedly inspects him as fast as possible.

It'll LD him out more often than not.

A friend in a large guild doesn't even bother petitioning
a GM for a world kick any more when a guildie goes to sleep,
she just uses this technique.
