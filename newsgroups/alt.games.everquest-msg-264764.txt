As stated by others, the voiceovers are optional and the sound controls 
offer considerable granularity. On just volume, for example, you can 
independently adjust for:

1) Master Volume
2) Music Volume
3) Combat Music Volume
4) Voice Volume
5) 3D Sound effects volume
6) Ambient Volume
7) Interface sounds volume

There are lots of other strange options, like a choice to hear voiceovers 
only the first time they're uttered, setting the maximum footstep distance, 
etc. Smed was right when he said there was an unprecedented level of control 
offered over options, the options dialog is pretty complete, giving you 
control over a lot of other things like the targeting rings, targeting 
highlights over mobs and players. And to answer your first question, choice 
of hearing voiceovers without chat bubbles, chat bubbles without voiceovers 
and/or both.

But I'm with Rob Berryhill on this one, I think you're denying yourself some 
real fun by missing out on the huge investment Sony's made on the audio 
side. I *still* get a kick out of hearing the centaurs in Thundering Steppes 
speak to me with their snooty aristocratic accents while we're fighting: 
"You'd best finish me off, 2-leg, for I shall not hesitate to finish you!" 
LOL!
