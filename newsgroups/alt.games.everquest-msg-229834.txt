When you zone you're actually in game and vulnerable for a couple
seconds before you regain control of your character on your computer
(exact time depends on connection).

The EC/Nek zoneline has to be one of the most camped spots in the
game. Trying to escape that way is like jumping out of the frying pan.

Even if I had to run all the way across the zone, I would have gone
for either Neriak or Lavastorm, both almost certain to be safer.
