Point taken, except it doesn't get much lower than metal bits when it
comes to improving throught the use of trivialy-combined materials.

You know, you can't dismiss *everyone's* opinion that confilicts with
your own with that tired little bit of rhetoric. Who ever said
anything about assumptions anyway? I am voicing opinions here.
OBVIOUSLY the creators don't agree.

Yes, but when you repeat this same experiment many times, the average
result will be pretty close to 10%.

Of course they will, but 40% (for example) will be pretty close to 40%
over a lengthy run, good streaks and bad streaks included.

I never said they did. I was just applying similar results to your 1%
example to illustrate my own point.

I completely understand the mathematics behind it all. There seems to
merely be a disconnect between reality and their skill building
metaphor is all. Yes, it should reflect a real life scenario to some
extent - not mirror, just share some similarity - fundamental
characteristics of practice to improvement ratios at the very least.
