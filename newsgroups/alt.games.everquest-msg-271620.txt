I've been doing that.

Lots of free buffs don't give the information that 10 plat is
required by someone unless the person making the 10 plat requirement
speaks it out in the open.

Wrong. I'm peeved that others who require a minimum had no problem
mentioing that in /ooc. The person who simply /ooc that temp was
available should had added 'minimum 10 plat donation'. Others did
it. So its not difficult.
