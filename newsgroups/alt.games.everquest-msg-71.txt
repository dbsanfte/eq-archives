Yes.  My point in rebuttal, though, was that Cazic gate potions are cheaper
(250-300pp on Fennin) and are instant casts ( so you can use it if you get
into trouble).  These days especially, Cazic is pretty empty, so it is often
easy to take a few people down to the AoF and smack the Cenobite around a
few times to get a couple.
