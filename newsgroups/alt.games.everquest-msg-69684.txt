I seriously doubt if Verant gave much thought to the possibility people
would ever play EQ on any OS but Win9x...not for a while, anyway.  Windows
2000 wasn't out yet and NT4 doesn't support beyond DX3, and you needed at
least DX5 (I think) for EQ.

Microsoft decided to change how the Windows key worked.  Was that Verant's
fault?  No, of course not.   Would it be nice if Verant got around to
disabling the key in Win2k/XP?  Of course...but they didn't even support
2k/xp until SoL and they've got other things on their hands right now.

If dstep's program doesn't work go to www.download.com and do a search for
winkey, and download Winkey killer.  Stick that in any folder and put a
shortcut to it in your Startup folder, or create a 3 line batch file to
start EQ.
