The way I am approching this is the same reason I am paying for
regular service (now)in the first place. I left Battle.net which is
totally FREE, because there were so many IDIOTS on it, PK's galore,
lag from hell, duping, duping, duping, one could take a char from
level 1 to 99 in about 10 hours of killing cows in hell, and scammers
left and right. Since battle.net was free there were unlimited amounts
of people on it and the service you got from any technical people was
NON-EXISTANT. As soon as I purchased EQ and started a new char about 2
months ago, I was greeted by a community of players that gave me help
without expecting anything back, or some kinda scam. People on EQ tend
to be an older crowd than those on Battle.net which I prefer, and they
also speak better english, and play the game the way it was meant to
be played -- you don't have people purposefully exploiting every
little loop in the game. Now as far as Lengends goes I look at it as a
step above this even, where people are probably going to be your REAL
serious gamers (aside from being the filthy richest too). I am not
going to join Lengends, unless I hit the LOTTERY or some distant
relative dies, but I can see how someone that can afford it would want
to go there. I agree that it is too pricey, and if they had made it
perhaps $25 a month I might have bitten, but as I am in a guild
already and established friends where I am, I doubt I would move even
if they lowered it to $20.
