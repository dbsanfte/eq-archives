Hi,
      One of my friends has just started hunting in the Overthere.  He
recons that it is a good place to hunt.  Looking at the eq atlas it
looks good to me, but being a good race it looks like i would be
killed on site. I wounder if any people from good race have hunted
here, and there thoughts.

	Thanks
