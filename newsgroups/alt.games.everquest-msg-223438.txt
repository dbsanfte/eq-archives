Totally incorrect. Learning the finer points of root-n-rot is NEVER a waste
of time, and is very laid back, no stress Exp. Quad Kiting is faster Exp (
at that level anyways ) I freely admit, but quadding wont be available to
him at all levels. Especially at the higher levels root-n-rot is your only
option. Root-n-rot is also used for getting your Elysian armor. Believe me,
a leevl 50ish Druid isnt going to have the mana to kite Elysians :) Also, at
higher levels root-n-rot is the only way to make exp. If theres a place
where a 65 druid can quad for decent exp, and by decent I mean more than a
blue of AA per quad which is what I get root-n-rotting in HoH or PoV, then
Id like to know about it.
