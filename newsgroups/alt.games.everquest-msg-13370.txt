Hello,

OK, I don't want to be flamed, but I wanted to get some true, honest
thoughts.

I have been playing EQ for about 3 months now and really enjoy it, but
I feel a little at a disadvantage because I started playing so late.

Are any of you going to be trying Anarchy Online?  It looks good and
has some new and different gameplay aspects.

Again, i'm not trolling, I just want some opinions...

Thanks

DW
