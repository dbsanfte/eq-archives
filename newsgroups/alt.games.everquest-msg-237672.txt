	Why, what a constructive suggestion!  Until I read and fully
abosrbed these words of immense wisdom I'd actually considered remaining
involved in a virtual world I very much enjoy and perhaps finding some
way to convince the providers of that world that yes, their customers
*do* care that they have severe quality flaws in both their product and
in the operation of the service that provides it, and that yes, it's in both
their own interest and that of those customers that those flaws be
addressed.  But now that I fully understand the situation, due entirely
to your invaluable and well reasoned input, I'll abandon that foolishly
conceived and oh so obviously impossible to execute plan! 

	Thank you ever so much.  It's people like yourself that really
make a difference in this world.
