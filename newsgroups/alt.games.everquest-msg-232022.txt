Hmm? There are already 5 servers in Europe, 3 of which are in English,
and 3 of which have European support staff.

And latency really isn't much of a problem in Everquest unless it gets
to silly levels, which happens to me when my ISP has one of their
"let's drop 50% of the traffic" episodes, but that's a completely
local issue, the server could be 100 meters away and it'd still suck.
