/em flips open his Hitchhiker's Guide:
...............wait a minute, where IS that quote........never mind,
/paraphrase:

"There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers what the
universe is really and truly all about, the whole thing will disappear and
be replaced with something even more complex and bizarre.
    There is another theory which states that this has already happened."

D, who wonders if it was actually a Pratchett quote...
