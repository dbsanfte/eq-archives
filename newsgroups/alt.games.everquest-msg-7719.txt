Yea Cazic is pretty tough.  Those lizzies regen
and if you get jumped by a bunch a healer may heal
them up as fast as you can beat them down.  I was
with a full group last night and we took on one
healer.  Seems like we beat on him for several
minutes until he quit healing himself and died
like a good little lizzie.
