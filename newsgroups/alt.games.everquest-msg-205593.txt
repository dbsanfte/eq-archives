You mean to tell me these "casinos" aren't philanthropic ventures created 
by GMs to help distribute plat to newbies?!  OMG, my world is crashing down 
around me, I think I'm going to have to lie down.

Thanks for the numbers and the permission to copy your work, but really all 
you need is some common sense: if you can't tell what the actual odds of 
winning are, don't gamble!  Is it that hard to see that they always give 
themselves a statistical advantage, or even that rolling over 600 on a 1-
1000 random only gives a 40% chance of winning?

You also forgot to include that for a dishonest casino, you will NEVER win 
on a sufficiently large bet.  I have seen some honest casinos around, who 
will honor it when someone happens to win the roll on their maximum bet, 
but they are few and far between.  IMO this is the only "scam" when it 
comes to casinos, otherwise the odds are pretty much out there for everyone 
to see.

About the only real reason I can see for replicating this anywhere would be 
to wipe out the spam caused by the casinos.  But then adding the operator 
to your ignore list and moving out of range of the /rands really isn't that 
hard either, and they do provide a somewhat entertaining diversion from the 
usual XP grind, even if I don't choose to participate.
