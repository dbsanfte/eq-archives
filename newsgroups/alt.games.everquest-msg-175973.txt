Dennis, which part of "... the Firiona Vie server, which has the one
char per account rule." is not clear?  On FV you get one character
per account, period.  And, as I noted, you will find tradeskill mules
and even bazaar mules there.  As for the limit to number of servers,
I'm not clear on why they would do that, nor on why that would make
any difference to players who might create mule accounts.
