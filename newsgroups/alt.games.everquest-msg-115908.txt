"mob" does indeed mean Mobile Object. Intended to represent any creature in
the game not under PC control. I dislike it in general, however it does the
best job of generalizing what you mean when you want to say "monk, go pull
some XP generating, non-player controlled polygonal animations". Your only
other option would be to specify the type of "mob" you want.

The Old D&D term was "Monster". It was used to describe *any* creature in
the game not under PC control in the original books, anything from a Dragon
to a Merchant was considered a "Monster". Later books took to calling more
player-character-like GM controlled creatures NPC (non-player-character).
