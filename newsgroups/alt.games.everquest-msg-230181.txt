   There was recently a thread, which I have forgotten the name of, here started
by breathe, which was sorta derailed by some guy making the statement something
along the lines of "Seriously, why even have a bard if you're not having him
pull?"  He promptly got beat down for this stupid statement, but it did get me
thinking.  I've been in a LDoN adventure where the bard puller brought back one
thing, almost every time.  I've been on a couple of others where the bard might
bring back one, or five.  The last dungeon I was I finally took over pulling,
after a partial party wipe and a couple other near misses.

   So, given the group listed above, who is the logical puller?  I would say a
combo of Cleric and Warrior, but then I am insanely used to this combo, so might
be missing the obvious.

  I think it's been very easy up to now.  When does the "easy" stage wear off? 
Fifty-ish?  Higher?

    The last LDoN I was in, the one near wipe we had was facilitated by a necro
who was new to grouping.  Seems the bard had one targeted, he assisted and sent
in the pet.  Problem was, he sic'ed it on one that bard was trying to lull.  The
bard came back with 3, and when the pet died another 4 came in.  We managed to
kill 4 of them, then lost 3 party members (including the bard and necro), before
the rest of us broke and ran  (well, Lenny feigned).  

    I took it as an excellent opportunity to help the necro learn that it's best
to wait until the puller actually comes back with the prey before one assists
and sic's.  No body yelled, and all stopped whining when I mentioned that I had
a 90% rez, so chill out.  And that is one of the best things about being a
cleric, I think.  If you or your whole party dies, you don't have to sweat about
getting a rez, or eating a full death.

   We are glad to have you back.  Sorry about the donkey balls suckage.
