Yes I remember when that happened and the old server population check that
you could do.
Hmm if it's quiet I'm even more interested in making the move. Playing on,
what would now appear to be, the most poulated server is not always fun.

FV still seems to be low in population to me, of course my characters are
low twenties and with out having alts it may be a different matter in the
planes and other high level zones...Then again, my other server is
Bristlebane and all but Karana is likely quiet compared to that :ï¿½/
Oh...and I like the TLC, I thought it was a decent idea. I think newbie
zones (dungeons) should have it...stop them being farmed for some "easy to
get but sells for a couple of k item" that someone wants to finance their
trade skills with.
Yeah the language rule is pointless...although it interesting to see the
majority speak Elvish or Dark Elvish as opposed to common.
