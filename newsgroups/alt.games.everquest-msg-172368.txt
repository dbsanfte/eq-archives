You misunderstand the scenario.

step one die
step two get KEI
step three get rez.

In this instance, the fact that buffs dissapear on death isn't an issue, its
the fact that you can get buffs after death and before rez... yes, those buffs
dissapear on being rezed, along with all your mana and most of your HP.  Thus,
if you are injured somehow on the CR or just via fighting stuff before your
rez, its useless to get a heal with the rez coming.  Also, if you've used any
mana, its useless to wait to get it back, or use a mod rod charge or get necro
mana pump with a rez coming.

Extending this logic further, a sensible (or even just a generous) person
should expend his mana on buffs or on killing stuff or something along those
lines before taking the rez, if convenient.  And a melee soloer may wish to
kill stuff so that his HP bar is nearly gone before taking the rez.  These are
only interesting insofar as optimum efficiency is concerned, of course.
