My condolences perhaps someday I'll worry about it though I'd honestly

Run3 is definitely useful even to a ranger. I can't count how many times
having it has saved my but when say hunting and SoW wore off or was
dispelled its not as fast but its still faster than regular runing :)
Run3 and Regen 3 should pretty much be written in as required AA for a
ranger in my oppinion ;)

This one the question really comes down to how you want to play your ranger,
Personally I got it before AM3/EQ and though for a bit I regretted it
because it slowed my progression to archery mastery. It was one of those
situations where I had AA burning a hole in my pocket and EQ just seemed so
damn far away. Unfortunantly I can't comment on DPS increase since I never
parsed pre PB. I can say that with my windblade I generally outdamage any
1hs combo one can buy (I even sold a windworn handblade cause it seemed to
be a bit of a waste considering that most of my time is spent using my bow
and when I'm not I just swap out to my WB)
From what I've read on the Glade this skill really shines when you get it
maxed out preferably with max crits and Ferocity. It does however have a
disadvantage of being the only pop AA I know of that has a progressive point
cost IE level 1 is 2 points then 4 then I think 6 for BP3.
Personally I'd hold off on it til you get a number of other AA polished off
particularly your archery stuff if you just can't bear to save your AA
towards the Ranger core skills you'd prolly be better off getting Ferocity
which will increase your double attack percentage and effects both 1 and 2
handers.

Head shot is really a flavor skill. I have it because well I just like
buying junk ;) and I was having issues getting myself to get through saving
the 6 for CF3 at the time (personally I recomend doing run3 reg3 and CF3
then EQ you just can't over estimate the value of never having to fletch or
summon an arrow again plus it opens up your soloing options, then AM1,2 and
3 trust me those things will turn you into a killing machine) but back to HS
its really only useful for farming plats and faction since mobs that it
effects don't generally give xp (haven't really tested since the con changes
for 60+ characters) still as say a 65th level ranger your still only really
talking about it taking out light blues anyway so you'll not be xping with
it.
I have to admit that its kind of fun for powerleveling lower level friends,
a couple times I've hung out with 58th-60th level friends in the bridge area
of Seb and its kind of fun to see the oohs when you one shot kill one of
those pesky froggy shammies or wizards :)

However that being said some of the other "flavor" AA's just rule Innate
camo has to be the handiest AA ever concieved not having to worry about your
camo droping 3seconds after you cast it.. Being able to camo while running
or hell just clicking it every time it refreshes while running circles
around a camp to annoy the casters trying to med just can't be beat. Right
behind that one in usefulness is Entrap, Ensnare with out having to waste a
spell slot just rules. Now I can keep TW for oops I was spacing out
situations and have a real ensnare that doesn't chew up my mana.
Oh yes and Gardian of the Forest is pretty damn cool too. In addition to
granting some nice atk and overhaste while active it also has the wonderful
ability to overwrite illusions like Wolf form while allowing you to maintain
their effects. This is especially useful if you are hunting places where
wolfies are "unliked" but still want to be able to get the atk and speed
from wolf form with out the faction issues or motion sickness problems
normally associated with it. Another nice little plus is that after the
effect wheres off one can then summon your horse and get the sitting mana
regen advantages of being mounted with out having to sacrifice the atk
bonus's.

Honestly I'd suggest rethinking the whole not too interested in EQ/AM3 thing
as a ranger those are the money makers they also alow one to solo in places
that you'd never otherwise dream. These skills are especially useful in POP
where most of the zones are pretty darn archery friendly.
Also with those skills a modestly equiped Ranger can be a killing machine
where as to really shine in melee one really needs access to No Drop weapons
for which the competition is feirce and the availability low and limited to
a select number of guilds who are hitting the upper tier planes and Emp and
VT.

And with the price of elemental bows coming down as fast as they are its
really easy to build a archery focused Ranger who can hold their own damage
wise with Uber Equiped Rogues and Wizards :)
