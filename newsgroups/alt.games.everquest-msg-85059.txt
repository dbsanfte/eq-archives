I would say your first mistake was starting the conversation with, and I
quote:
"BACK OFF YOU KILL STEALERS".

What kind of reaction did you hope to get from them with that as an ice
breaker?  I know what my response to you would have been.  Along the lines
of "go to hell".

My point having nothing to do with the actions of either group.  Merely an
observation of perhaps a better way to resolve the issue before it is an
issue.  I personally think anyone that "reports" someone for "kill stealing"
is a wanker.  Probably runs home to mom when someone at work takes their
pencils, too.  Grow up.
