Which is more the pitty.  If we want an international sport, we should stick
to hocky, and leave soccer for those who don't know better.  There's only
one good thing about soccer, and that's Mia Hamm. ^__^

I knew a rugby player who came to the U.S. figuring that he could pick up
the real football with ease.  First practice, he saw the size of a football

any protection?
