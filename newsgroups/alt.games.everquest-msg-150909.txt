Have you taken a look at Neverwinter Nights?

How about console games?  Get a Super Nintendo, which should be dirt cheap,
and get The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.  That was one of the best
games ever.  Or get a Nintendo 64, which is also pretty cheap now, and get
the first Zelda game for that: Occarina of Time.

A bunch of people at work are playing Battlefield: 1942, and it looks pretty
interesting.
