Three actually ;) The original and two completely seperate revamps.
Apparently, the current version of PoM depends on which server you are
on, some are on version 2, and some are on version 3 oddly enough.
Check out www.planeofmischief.com - lots of great info for this great

lumped together, so its  hard to determine what is what with the zone.
How mischevious! =p
