    As has been pointed out, a feigned Necro is at almost NO risk of death
(AoEs can still hit them, right?) An AFK mage can be killed quite easily, as
the original poster proved. Also, "coding to change a practice" doesn't
equal "GM will kick your ass if they see you doing it".

    Likely because it riles them, and if the bard truly is AFK there's no
way they'll be able to tell why they got disconnected later. :-)
