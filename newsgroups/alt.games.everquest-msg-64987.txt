    Stumpy, give it to me straight - how did the bearded dwarf women make
out? A rogue in my group last night had the expansion and was telling me "I
don't want to know", but I suspect he hated the idea of bearded women in
general. He sure perked up when Rosy used her Guise, though. I guess as long
as we lost leather look pants and leather look "dunce cap" hats it'll be an
improvement.
