Why is it somehow, to your way of thinking, better to spend the 20m between 
1m and 21m, rather than the 20m between 80m and 100m?

You're right- it is not rocket science. It is, however, an exceedingly 
complex environment where Chaos can easily rear its head. When you pull 
your single, you do not know if it aggroed another in the tunnel below that 
will come back with 5 friends 30 seconds after the pull hits. You do not 
know if it will path by those casters over there, nor do you know if it 
will have some previously-unknown ability.

Having a margin for error is the intelligent way to handle it. Either of 
the above situations can result in a wipe when the cleric runs out of 
healing and the chanter runs out of mezzing. Is it their fault? No. It is 
your fault because you cannot be suffered to slow your pulls-per-minute, 
even in the face of more mobs-per-hour and less wipes-per-attempt.

As a former Monk, you are the kind of Monk that gives Monks a bad 
reputation for being morons.

Betting on everything going precisely as you plan is.

You do not know if the Cleric will fizzle that CH, bringing him just under 
the amount he needs t cast it.

Anyone grouping more than once with you would have to be a slow-minded 
idiot.

Bullshit. In a group where the magician is signifigantly higher in level 
than anyone else, he can be the best puller. In a situation when the 
magician has a SOW and others do not, he can be the best puller.

That's right, cling to your "I'm right, I'm right, I can't hear you LALALA" 
mantra.
