Hmm. My highest caster to date? Zandril, 36 druid on Saryrn. That's the 
same tired argument way too many people have applied to way too many 
issues on which they have a strong, yet unsupported position. Please feel 
free to try again - though a fresh tactic with some basis in fact would 
be appreciated.

Everytime I have ever had KEI, I felt like I was cheating. It was too 
easy. I won't go out of my way to get it. Do I click it off if it's given 
to me? Of course not. But I will say this, after gaining a couple levels 
using it, I'd have nothing to show for it except a couple more levels. It 
wasn't half as challenging nor half as entertaining. Sure, there are 
legitimate situations where it's a great thing to have, but more often 
than not it's a shortcut and nothing more. It's for the short-attention-
span, instant-gratification, I-must-be-more-uber-than-all crowd more 
often than not.

I repeat, it's a crutch.
