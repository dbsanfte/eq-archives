The problem is that there's only so many ways to encourage
players to move to other zones.   Either you make the experience
so good (and the risk of dying low) that people flock there (see
Oasis, LoIO, OT, etc.) or you make the loot so good that groups
will form elsewhere and go there to hunt (dungeons in general.)

VI tries the experience factor by adding zone bonuses, but that
doesn't do anything about the risk of dying, especially in the
dungeons that are underutilized.  That leaves the item carrot,
but if they do that, higher-levels effectively remove the motivation.
I didn't try the new Runnyeye, for instance, because a simple /who
in zone the first week showed quite a few 40s and 50s in zone.
Why fight my way in - at risk of death - just to see a 58th druid
camping the item I went there to get?

(Yes, the PnP says camps are to be shared, and a GM would
certainly support any /petition.   But who wants to share a
camp you're barely able to hold for a rare drop that you now
have even less chance of getting?   Besides, when my toon is
58, I just may not want that druid to remember me and stop
be from getting into a raid/guild/etc.)

Harm?  No, of course not.   Stop them from getting something
they can because they can't get better themselves?  Yes, at
least without buying it.

Would you agree a group of level ones should be able to take
down Sleeper's Tomb?   Level-appropriate content is aimed
at the appropriate levels, surprisingly enough.   A 60th level
warrior has a much business in Unrest, for instance, as a 20th
level warrior has in Sleepers.   I suspect VI cares as much for
50's saying they can't hunt the Warrens as they do for 10's
saying they can't hunt Cobalt Scar.

More appropriately:  would you whine to McDonalds about not being
able to play in the playground if they built it after you were too old?
The difference between real life and EQ, of course, is that you can
always be young again if you want.

That assumption doesn't seem to be true, at least in my experience.
Items which can be sold for a decent pp/hr are farmed, and almost
always by people too high to be getting experience.

But, again, if VI wants to encourage lower-levels to use a zone (which
is a "good thing"), they've only got limited ways to do that.   And, of
those ways, making the loot desirable is the best way to do that.
The Trivial Loot Code just allows VI to use that method without
knowing that higher-levels will simply move in.

Just to be clear:  we're not talking about quest items, just normal
loot.   As far as I'm concerned, it should be applied across the
board.   So what if that 56th druid I saw quad-kiting kodiaks in WC
can't get her own bear pelts?   It's a good way to encourage a
player economy that has some flow from lower-levels to the
higher-levels, instead of being almost always the other way.
