Sorry, but you are *completely* ignoring the question of context. If I use
obscene language in a Catholic nunnery or when children are present, I'm
certainly being an asshole. If on the contrary, I refuse to utter any
cusswords (and why would I, anyway), when I'm amongst friends who do
liberally, and the situation is relaxed and spirits are high, I'm being an 
asshole too. Profanity is only rude if those at the receiving end are going 
to take offense at it; a nun would, a sailor probably wouldn't.

I don't particularly care for people who swear constantly and
inappropriately, but by the same token, I don't think much of people who
say "Oh, poop!" when the situation calls for "HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!"

And that has to do with profanity exactly what? (except for the stream of 
profanity I uttered at the complete spinelessness of that movie, of course)

Again, it depends entirely of where and when and in front of whom.
