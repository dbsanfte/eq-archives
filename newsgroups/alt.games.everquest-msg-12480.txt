Here are a few more uses for Eye of Zomm:

1. Unlike a pet, it can be killed by players who you are not dueling
with.  The Eye is level 1, with something like 1hp.  If the player is
low enough level that they get XP from level 1 mobs, they get XP for
killing your Eye!  Furthermore, if they miss, the Eye won't fight back.
Thus, with the Eye you can quickly PL newbies to level 2.  Just cast it
10 times and let them whack it 10 times.

2. In zones without frequent spawns, casting an Eye will help ShowEQ
users get more information.  Apparently, ShowEQ uses a brute-force
attack against the spawn data packets to break the zone encryption,
and, I'm told, when someone zones in using ShowEQ, everything shows
up as "unknown" until something spawns.  (They get the mob positions,
just not the name and level or other info).  If you cast an Eye, as soon
as it spawns, ShowEQ is able to figure out the the key and decrypt
everything.  I'm told pets have the same effect, but those take
components.  Sometimes when I zone, I cast an Eye, just in case there
are ShowEQ users in the zone who need a little help. :-)

3. If there are no greens around, you can cast an Eye for a Necro or SK
to lifetap.  Note that the lifetap line of spells heal for the full
amount, even if the mob does not have that many hitpoints.  This could
be useful in an area where a Necro or SK wants to heal, but there are no
mobs wimpy enough to heal from safetly outside of a serious fight.

Even with these exciting uses...Eye of Zomm is probably not going to
move to the front of my spellbook. :-)
