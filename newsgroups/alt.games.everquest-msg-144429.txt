Methinks that in the case of highly twinked lowbies the phrase "non
ideal group" is robbed of most of its meaning.   :-p

It is also true that the "Rangers can't tank" horse has been
beaten well beyond death.  I was in a mini-raid once at L51
where a L57 Ranger wearing several pieces of SS quest armor was
jolting the mobs off to me routinely.  At a guess, he'd have had
to be wearing pure stat jewelry in half a dozen slots to avoid
having an AC higher than mine was at the time.
