You refuse to help anyone who's currently killing an animal. Do you also
refuse to help anyone who has killed animals in the past?

Barbarian - wolves and bears in the newbie area
Halfling - wolves and bears in the newbie area
Human/Half-Elf - wolves and bears in the newbie area
Dark Elf - wolves and bears in the newbie area
Wood Elf/High Elf - wolves and bears in the newbie area
Iksar - (scaled) wolves in the newbie area

So, do you only help out dwarves, gnomes, ogres, and trolls?
