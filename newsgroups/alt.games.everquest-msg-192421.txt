    How could their l33t beta sources tell them about the change, though, if
the change wasn't intended? ;-)

    Their original GL, Occy, was the first wizard to get the WIZ epic on any
server. Their current GL is also a wizard. They have always been very
pro-caster, and in particular pro-wizard. Their site is unavailable right
now, or I'd give you the exact number of wizards they have - it's quite
amazing. Two of them, Zupe and Gemlin, have been posting up a storm on
Graffe's so the "crit=death" bug must have hit them hard.

    I'm not a melee, so correct me if I'm way off here. My understanding on
melee range was that if you could hit it, it could hit you. So I don't
understand how you can say rampage range > melee range, when especially for
the new "AoE Rampage" mobs you can melee them from outside AoE Rampage
range.
