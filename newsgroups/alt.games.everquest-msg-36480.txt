I have run 3 characters up to 15th in the Warrens that where KoS. I have
found that if you stand with your back to the door just inside the tunnel to
the "yard" and line up the distant tree to the left ant the base of the
hill, running straight at the tree, (shoot the middle) the guards have never
argoed on me. I have never invised or had to use Sow. There is a narrow path
there if you look for it. BTW, for a low lvl area the Warrens mobs do drop
great loot. I can average about 20 pp a night with my 11th lvl Druid. Not to
mention the random chance at Ringmail for turning in the Molars.
