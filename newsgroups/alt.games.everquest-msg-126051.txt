The spell itself is a single target version of protection of the glades, the
druid HP/AC/mana regen buff.  Not terrible but not really something
to write home about either.  Its possible to get it via the quest you
mention, although you've mangled it... the quest involves buying items
in FV and running them up to FG.

The real original quest also yields the spell, but in addition it yields
a very very nice druid only earring with impressive stats and a clickable
circle to dreadlands, mana free.

Anyone can do that quest if they like, and take the result earring to
FG to trade for another earring which is all/all and has similar Uber
stats and Flowing Thought One.

The spell pales in comparison to the earrings, and I'd strongly advise
druids with good giuld support do the quest not once but twice, there
aren't a whole lot of better earrings in the game.

Too bad they aren't wearable under level 51...
