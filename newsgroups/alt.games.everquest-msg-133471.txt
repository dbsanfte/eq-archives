yah you can follow this guild around on my server
called Phantom Raiders. They cheat all the fucking
time, we have various screenshots of them cheating
by using the y exploit in game to kill Arch Lich
of Ssra, Cursed. Have ss of them exploiting pathing
rights in Temple of Veeshan and Kael Drakkel. Only
thing is you need to be level 60, suck alot of cock
and speak almost no english. Most of them are 
europhags, so if you dont mind pulling your pants
down every now and then... hey I'll be making sure
you get ks daily.
