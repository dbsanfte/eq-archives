OK, picture this: rogue is playing MT, and her BS pops up.  She
hits attack off, evade, backstab... and hits the mob square in
the chest because despite successfully evading, the mob didn't
turn round, just stood there looking like an idiot with its
tongue hanging out.  Why?  Its stunned.

Now if there's a MT in position, so the rogue has her pointy all
ready to shove into the mob soon as it comes up, and evades
after, than this isn't an issue, the stunned mob won't even bat
an eyelash when the dagger hits his kidney, just stand there
stunned.

Its possible for the rogue to realize whats happening and after
evading run round to the back of the mob for her stab... but
thats getting tricky and then the stun might wear off while she's
in mid runaround and... well its a mess.

Prox aggro will work to give a PC aggro over another PC, but
without someone standing there the root isn't going to do
anything to give it to the pet, unless evade is special and
violates that general rule.

Splendid
