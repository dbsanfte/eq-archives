I went to a few (ok, 4 :) stores here yesterday,
and none of them had Depths of Darkhollow yet.
This is in Connecticut, USA.

Has anyone seen it in (US) stores yet?
I don't want to buy the online-only version,
since I want the "free" mount for my
beastlord.

But I also don't want to keep going to stores if
some production problem has kept the boxes off the
shelves...

Thanks in advance!
