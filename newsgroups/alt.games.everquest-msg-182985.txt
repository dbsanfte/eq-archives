Pet tanks, heal pet.

They say druids can't solo summoners too, I laugh in their face.  Just
soloed a mini-named in PoI last night (a rust covered model), though I think
he might've gotten slowed by one of the 20 naked people sitting around in
the GY watching me, still finished fight at 70% mana and hp.  soloing
summoners with charm is a lot easier though.

Phinny has been soloed by necros, mages, wizards (manaburn crit) and druids
for sure.

The druid solo is fairly recent afaik though.
