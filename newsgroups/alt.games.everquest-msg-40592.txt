If I remember correctly it went along the lines of :
make an enchanter
get as many  +CHA Items as possible
get 135 skill in baking by making fish rolls,
go to Thrug, using some recipe, make some food for 3.3sp and sell for 6.6sp
to vendor.
that's a 100% profit,

Wow, Omg.. amazing
/sarcasm off

What they don't tell you is that you need to sit there all night just to
make around 100pp, woot ;)
I also believe the selling price has been nerfed making this strategy next
to useless.
