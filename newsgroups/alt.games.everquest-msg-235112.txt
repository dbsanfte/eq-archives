Skaarak,

Heh.. I get confused sometimes.  :)  I post under the name of the toon most
appropriate to the story I'm telling.  I play:
Rhian - 65 Wizard
Soulfrost - 65 Enchanter
Raivenn - 58 Bard
Eijenhar - 56 Mage
Tcharlee - 43 Ranger
Toleruc - 21 Cleric
and a few other odds and sods...

I was writing as Tcharlee, but mostly thinking about bardic stuff since I
was teaching him how to be a bard.  Hence the mis-signature.

Rhia - um.. Raiv... um, tcha... well, signed by me, anyway.  :)
