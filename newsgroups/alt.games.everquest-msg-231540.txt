Another validating voice - My ignore list is MUCH larger than yours
(probably two dozen) and maybe once every few weeks I'll join a group, see
Goatfeces is a member, /tell the group leader that I have a problem with
that person and apologize for the problem, then leave.  There are five
thousand plus people on my server at any time of the day or night, I can
find a group that won't give me a migraine.

(No, Goatfeces isn't the guy's real name - but it's what the whole group was
calling him by the time that particular LDON was over.)
