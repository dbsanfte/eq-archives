A guild can advance in the game without harsh requirements; sure they do 
it slower but that's because they don't raid as often so it takes longer 
to get to the same point. But even 'family guilds' are raiding beyond 
luclin now.

GIGO is right. But its the player that joins a LDoN knowing full well 
he's likely to f*** his group over at the drop of a hat is the garbage 
in. The garbage out is the resentment, failed adventure, and resultant 
poor reputation of that player/guild.

Nobody but a self-obsessed powertripping twit would honestly beleive 
that you should screw your prior commitments to participate in a 
spontaneous unannounced, unplanned raid. They can ask sure, and you owe 
it your guild to attend if you are available... but if you have made 
other commitments your guild is pretty self-absorbed if it can't respect 
them.

That such guilds do exist only highlights the fact that there is no 
shortage of greedy self-obsessed powertripping twits who have no regard 
for anything but their own self-interest.

That such guilds are successful only highlights that the master/slave 
relationship is efficient for getting things done.

If you are in such a guild *and* you are happy there... then I pity 
you... but fine.. to each their own, but then you have no business 
joining pickup LDoNs. If you want to LDoN do it with your guild... at 
least that way if a raid is called you can all leave together.
