I don't care. Go for it. What are you going to do? Stalk me...?

A stalker would make nice company.

I don't really know you either, however I know when someone is being a
jackass. I have no problem with you hating them, but you chose the
completely wrong method to display it. If you had attacked them
intellectually, you probably would have struck their egos and had a decent
flame. But yet you chose to attack them by acting like a hard-ass in a video
game? You accomplished nothing this way.

In lieu of sophistication, there is posturing.

As for trying to be a groupie, I don't exactly have the best post history
with Bizbee, Lokari, and Dark Tyger. Just about every time I've 'spoken'
with them, we have exchanged insults. As you may imagine, I don't
particularly like them - just as they don't like me. However, that's what
makes it a wonderfully working relationship...

Basically, I have no reason to get into their favour.

In regards to Dan Day and Richard... I don't really know them, so once
again, it's not my priority to become 'friends' through flaming you.

Of course, bastardizing Dan Day's name wasn't the best way to show off your
intellect. I saw that crap in early Elementary school.
