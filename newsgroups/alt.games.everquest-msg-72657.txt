If you want to go to LOIO you are going about it the hard way.  While
the boat route to Overthere from Oasis does seem like the easy way,
it involves risk from those ogres you saw, plus you will be KOS at
OT, plus you will have to travel several somewhat dangerous zones
from OT to LOIO.

First alternative would be to go to BB docks instead, and take shuttle
out to TD where you board a boat to FV.

Second, less obvious alternative is to take that barrel barge from
Oasis to TD, then swim to the Elven Outpost, and take shuttle
from there to the boat which will take you to FV docks (first stopping
at shuttles to BB, so this isn't a time saver if port to BB is available)

From FV you can run to LOIO... but this is actually a somewhat
dangerous little jog, with see invisible spiders on the route who
can root you in place, preventing you running past them with
SOW.

Third, you can get a port to DL... but DL to LOIO runs are also
dangerous and blockaded by you guessed it, See Invisible
Root casting spiders!  Also until you get ring of combines
you can't do this under your own power.

Fourth way, though, often overlooked, is to take either BB or
Oasis route to TD (heck, FV and OT routes in work too) and jump
ship, swim to the far SW corner and a bit NE of there find the
Firepots room under the combine spires.  In there are ports to
every old world city but Qeynos and Paineel, and to Cabalis.
Cabalis port puts you at the border to LOIO, away from the
wander or aggro path of any guards.  Put SOW and Camo
up just before you go, using the pots won't break camo.  Now
you can just zone out, run past the two or three guards in your
flight path, and you are home free in LOIO.  The run is so short
that even if camo starts blinking you can make that run out and be
out of aggro before the guards can see you.  And here's the bonus:
the guards neither see invis nor Root!

If you are too low level to bind yourself (or for hybrids which
can invis themselves but not bind) you can bind right there in
Cabalis at the zone line.  Don't do this if you can't invis or
hide/sneak or at least FD, as you will be forced to leave there
naked later....
