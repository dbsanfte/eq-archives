Hurray sanity at last !

Okay so Sony f****d up on the original release which is daft
condiderring how long the beta ran for.

But they also did something sensible at last ... they logged who
handed in what so that they can make the exploiters suffer rather than
everyone!  WTG Sony !

For all of you who handed in giant snake fangs or bought loads of
worthless items from the bazaar ... you KNEW that you were using an
exploit so TOUGH !  Why can't you just PLAY the game and enjoy it
rather than trying to cheat it???
