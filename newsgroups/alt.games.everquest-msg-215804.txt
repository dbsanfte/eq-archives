And we're forgetting something here -

100 wins in a level 60 dungeon with 4 well equipped/aa'd 65's and
2 decent 58's is about twice as easy as 100 wins in a 65 dungeon
with 6 65's which is about 3 times as easy as 100 wins in a 70 
dungeon.  BUT those 100 wins all look the same on the leaderboard.
