Its is only a matter of ones opinion, and I think the Diablo I/II playing
style seems fun (cept I am not into hack and slash). I mean if I had some RL
buddies that I played with and had a FUN time level wouldn't matter, it
would be cool just to hang out with 4 or 5 friends crushing Diablo and going
on a PKing spree if someone got you ticked off heh

For me its more an online experience not a game experience because frankly,
most online games have to many flaws to have an enjoyable time =p

Phantasy Star/Online is a good example. Its KILLER offline, yet online its
all about the phat l00t, PKing, CKing (character killing), Duping items...
They took the fun out of that game, it wont survive online, yet if it were
offline and followed (at least partly) the PS story-line it would rock.

Get my point?
