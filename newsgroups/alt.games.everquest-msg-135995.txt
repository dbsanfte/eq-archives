Maybe people didn't know...

That's his choice. Perhaps he was roleplaying.

I'm all for hating the vast majority of people for the things they do, but
the least you could do is hate the right people.

Congratulations. You help friends.

No. However, I also don't go out of my way to make people I don't know
miserable. That's just being a prick.

> ethics = all relative, so go suck me off

Correct. And your ethic system conflicts with many people, so shouldn't you
expect criticism?

Here you are reveling in the misery of another, and you expect people to
treat you like a Human being? Wake up.

> knows no one in this life looks out for him

Once again, you're right. But the way you make enemies is by being an
asshole. Then you have people actually against you.

If you wear a tie, you can stop the foreskin from covering your eyes.
