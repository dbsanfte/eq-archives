I'd drop (in options at login screen) your graphic quality to low and turn
off all character models, or atleast the ones there are alot of (ogres,
trolls, gnomes, woodelves).

In game I'd turn off spell effects (partical density) and in really laggy
zones drop your resolution to 50 percent or lower.

Just the two I thought of off the top of my head. Thats what I did when I
was lagging bad from an old vid card.
