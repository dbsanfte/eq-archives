The short answer is, you can't.  If they aren't /afk, you can try sending 
the seller a tell to see if they can direct you to their location. 
Otherwise, if you really want that item, you'll have to pay the fee.

Keep in mind some of the Inns can be within the main city districts, they 
don't have to be in the outer villages.  Also, if you're not familiar with 
the Inn, are you perhaps browsing the black market broker?  Could be that 
the Inn you are seeing is in the other city.
