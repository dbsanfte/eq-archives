Well... sometimes.  Depends on the red...  ::grin::

For the newbie, I totally agree - CONSIDER is your friend.  Big time.  Picking
up anything that drops and selling it, even if it's only for a measly 8
copper, is your friend, because eventually you can buy upgraded armor and
weapons.  Also, as someone who has been playing for quite some time, I *hated*
Stromm, because the PC to Monster ratio is insanely out of whack.  If I were
starting a character brand new, I'd start on any other server THAN Stromm,
simply because the newbie zones aren't hunted out on them.  There are actually
things for Level 5s to kill in East Commons on Zeboxoruk, for example...
