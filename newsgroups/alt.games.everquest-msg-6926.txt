The difference is, when someone shoots you outside the grocery store, that
person is then wanted for capital murder for which he will likely get the
death penalty or life in prison.

The game recreates the getting shot part of it well enough but it doesn't
impose ANY sort of repurcusion, moral, legal, or otherwise.

It is fun to play against other players for the element of challange.
However the nature of EQ creates an environment potentially devoid of
challange, where players run around looking for other players who con low
blue or high green to them so that they can kill them WITHOUT a challange
and loot from them items that cost the player a great deal of real invested
time.  This is simply frustrating to people.  Hopefully the new conning
system will alleviate some of this.

Best Regards
