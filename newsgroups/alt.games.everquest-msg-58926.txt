Heh, experience with my previous ogre shaman suggests that if I can't do 
the wine quest, I can't do the lightstone quest... bleah.

I took another look, and I think I found the source of the trouble...  I'm 
a shaman of Rallos Zek.  Would that do it?

I also got a guild wizard to invis me while the give screen was up, and 
then lokar took the wine just fine.  Thing is, now I'm kindly with Lokar, 
but that dang wizard is still threatening... :/  Who the heck does Razran 
F'lok think he is, anyway?

It looks like the bad faction is probably with The Dead, but that's just a 
theory...
