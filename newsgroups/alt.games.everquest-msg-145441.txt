I refuse to let them drive me into /roleplay.

It's gotten a lot better lately.  I think it's because school started and
the kids are not as numerous. It used to be that I couldn't linger in
certain zones for very long before fleeing, but now I can actually bank in
peace for a few minutes.

The worst guy so far was when I was at the Fear portal setting up for a
break.  I get a tell from a low-level druid in Oasis asking me to meet him
at the druid ring so I could KEI him.  Yeah, right.  I didn't respond
immediately, and he kept it up.  Finally, I told him that for 500pp, I would
drop what I was doing, leave my group, and run across the zone to buff him. 
First, he said "what???", then "nm".

And one time, I was running randomly around Paludal, killing Sensate Reishis
for their lenses.  I get a tell from some guy "come to B1 and KEI me".  Him,
I told "sorry, busy".  Then he starts asking me where I am.  "I'm in a big
cavern with mushrooms in it".  I kept that up for several minutes before he
figured out that I wasn't going to stop what I was doing just for him.

And last night, I'm reading a book while waiting for a Nexus spire to pop. 
I look up to see a trade window with 10 (ten) plat in it.  I scroll back my
buffer to see a /tell from the guy asking for KEI - "will donate".  A bit
later, I see several /aucs and /oocs from this guy, asking for it.  Then I
see a couple of "Hail, Pasketti"s.  I haven't responded to any of them.  A
dimwitted tree sloth would have noticed that I'm obviously AFK.  I decide to
see how long he'll wait.  The trade window stays up for a couple more
minutes, then drops.  He stands in front of me for a minute, then tries
another "Hail".  Another minute, and he backs away, then starts /ooc and
/auc again.  He was still doing it when the spires popped.

Some people are just too dependent on it.
