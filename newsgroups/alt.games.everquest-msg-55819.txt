How did iknow some one was going to shout gnom power? rofl

I'm more conserned with the _BASE_ stats the in the long run, afetr all if
your char is a twit or a weekling there is no long run. ( I will get
disgusted with it before such time)

Like my barb rogue. 137 str, but 60 int. he has to spend insane amounts of
time learning skills, screw that. If I could find non race/class only +int I
would be happy, but thtas just not going to happen any time soon.

 HOWEVER this was my first char so now I know.

I will up dtae as to my choise. Is anyone on bertoxx here? My main INT
consern is when I get poisons, the poison rogues should  know why. They are
exspencive to teach a dumass how to make/use.
