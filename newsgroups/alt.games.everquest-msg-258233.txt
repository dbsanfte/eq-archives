No, I'm not advocating C, although I can see why you might think that.
What I'm advocating is what happens up to the point of the merge, not what
happens after the merger has already occured.  Once someone has merged in
front of me and I'm aware that my current speed is going to result in a
collision, I slow down. Or if I cannot slow down but a lane to my left is
available, I'll merge over myself.

What I AM advocating in my cranky, stubborn bitchy way is that when
traffic is sane and someone is to my right and wants to merge where I
am, I won't change my speed. Not even if they get forced to drive on the
shoulder.  THEY have to speed up to get ahead of me or slow down to get
behind me.  In fact, if they were following the laws, it is in fact SAFEST
for me to maintain my current speed so that I am acting like a predictable
object for them.

Would I do this on a road where there was no safe shoulder? No, I'm not so
assinine as to get someone outright killed.  But there are cases where it
is quite safe and the only thing that gets hurt is the nerves of the
driver who just realized he can't treat a merge ramp like an intersection
where has the green light.

No, Lance, not always true.  The laws *are* safer if people follow them.
I would rather try to drive according to the regulations set in place,
with a keen eye out for those who don't so that I can drive defensively if
need be, than throw in the towel with the rest of the monkey boys who cut
others off, forget turn signals, merge as if there is no one else on the
road, only slow down to 5mph at stop signs, and any number of other
shortcuts that have become "jungle law"  around here.
