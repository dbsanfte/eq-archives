I'm assuming your INVIS wore off and not your SEE INVIS like you said. :)

Well, the one time I was around that cave it seemed that the stuff I was
around were undead, so unless you were using Invis to Undead, they attacked
you 'cause they saw you.

Or it's possible they can see through invis.

Or it's possible you weren't watching your chat window and didn't notice
your invis was about to break.  Or it lasted its maximum duration and you
didn't notice the icon blinking.
