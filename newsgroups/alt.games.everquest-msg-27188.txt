Ok this is a rant if you don't like rants stop reading. =)

Why do people come in the a zone and ask for the /loc
of common landmarks or zones?

I was hunting in GD last night and some idiot kept shouting for
the /loc of Velk's Lab. Over and over and over again.
Then he started whining about how 'we' (meaning everyone
in the zone I guess) were pricks for not giving him the
/loc.

Jeez is it that freakin' hard to download a map and
print it out, or get the loc list from eqmaps? I don't keep
/locs memorized and I sure as hell was not going to look
it up for him or go over to VL to get the location for him.
Plus, VL ain't that hard to find.

Please don't give me the line that 'maps are spoilers and
are not part of the RP vision thing.' Neither is the /loc
command. Because if your character can find his way with
his /loc, which IS a map location, he must have a map right?

Now I can understand getting the /loc of your group or
a person that you are meeting, since they could be anywhere.

I don't know about everyone else but I generally find out as
much about a place as I can if I am going to travel through or
hunt in an area. I get a map, talk to guildmates and friends
and then I go explore the area. Are people so caught up in the
exp grind that they just move from one 'exp giving' spot to
another without thought to what's in between?

Another thing that pisses me off along this same line are people
that don't use sense heading. How can you play this game
without that basic skill? I can't count the number of times I teleport
someone and they have to ask me which direction a major city or
zone is in. I tell them "Just head East", Then they ask me
"Which way is that?" WTF?!?!?

Makes me wonder about the very first players to explore a zone.
Gee, who did they ask the /loc from? How did they know which
direction to go in? =)

Ok rant off.
Asbestos suit on and flame retardant gel applied, let 'er rip.
