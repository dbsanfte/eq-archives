Paineel is great from 1-4 after which it becomes toxx forest and sucks eggs.

Id rate butcher as good as misty thicket. Its a big zone with a lot of out
of the way camps, and good up to lvl 14. (chessboard, dwarven bandit camp),
and of course 40+

This is great up to lvl 7 or so, then you need to head out to WK which kind
of sucks. I might chance a run through to RV/misty instead.

NRo has a few too many poison mobs, but not such a bad zone

ugh... the trees

This zone is utter crap. The zone is insanely dark (even with UV), the
spawns are few and far between, and dont come anywhere near nektulous/newbie
guards, so unless you know how to strafe run, you die. I went to WF with my
DE cleric, and came back to nektulous to camp the undead in the SE corner
later on.

When I started my (defunct) eru mage, I ran him down to paineel for the
first few levels. There actually is good hunting in toxx forest at level 8+,
but you need someone to break the camps (skellies).

Id call both east and west commons newbie zones too, and give them a good
rating.
