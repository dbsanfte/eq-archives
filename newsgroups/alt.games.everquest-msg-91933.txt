Hmm, I guess that wouldn't be too important... Just take a pic of
whatever you have up next time you're on your wizzy.

It's for a (hopefully) funny EQ spoof. I sincerely believe it is
funny, but who knows? Maybe it's the most pathetic attempt at humor
since Carrot Top?

Is that your real email? Can email you one of my finished pics as
a demo if you want =) Jpeg, about 50-55k in size.

Oh, and I'll need an uncompressed pic from wizzy, and since it's
uncompressed, I'd be happy if you send just the one, else my
ISP will come down upon me with great wrath.

I'm almost finished now, just need the gems a typical wizzy and a
typical ranja uses, to make the shots look as authentic as possible.
I suppose I can make some convincing fake hotkeys no problem, so
those aren't as crucial.

Oh, and feel free to censor the chat area, if you are concerned
about that. Won't need it at all.
