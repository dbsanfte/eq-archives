What use is a rogue?  Well, how about the highest sustained damage
output of any class?

I agree that the class name might be misleading if you're expecting a
master soloer.  It doesn't make the class worthless, though.

There are plenty of locked doors in higher-level zones, meaning a rogue
is useful or essential for certain areas (even for regular XP groups -
like the crypt in Sebilis, the back part of City of Mist, or pretty
much all of Howling Stones).  Pickpocketing is a marginally useful
skill admittedly, but you will need it for your epic.

Again, higher-level zones.  Try messing about in the labryinth in
Velk's or the chetari tunnels in Dragon Necropolis without disarm
traps.  Even a mid-level zone like Tower of Frozen Shadow has them -
Velious & Luclin zones are where you'll find most of them.

The most important part of that paragraph was "level 11".  When you get
to higher levels, you will (like I said right at the top) be doing more
sustained damage per second than any other class.
