Mike:

I never said that I wanted to 'suicide' down to 60, and by 'error in
judgement' was aimed at my PC being able to handle the lag in PoP - If I had
known then I would have stayed at 60. However, 30% towards 62 has taken me
three weeks to get, so I don't *really* want to throw that away. I'm simply
wanting to hunt somewhere that will yield experience at 61 without having to
go to PoP zones.

If only I could find a camp like the one I had with Nathyn's guards I'd be
delighted - One AA in seven hours was acceptable to me, 30% regular
experience in three weeks most certainly isn't.

As for the 'upgrade' - well, I'm currently looking at a faster CPU in a new
PC, and hopefully a HDD with a better access speed. I'm off to the stores
tomorrow to see what I can buy with my limited funds. I hope this answers
your questions.

Regards ..

Stevie.
