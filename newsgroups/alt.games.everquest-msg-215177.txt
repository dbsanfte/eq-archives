Very good point.  We had our little guys on - party was level 29 to 35.  ML was
29 cleric.  Our dungeon was in Oasis.  Three of the people in our group had
never played there before (including him) and didn't have maps of the zone. 
(This doesn't surprise me.  All the zones that are more than 3 zones from a
Knowledge book are generally empty these days.  Old world even more than new. 
Since they all level to 24 or so in Paludal how much of the world are these
newbies even SEEING?  Anyway, I digress). 
The looter beamed into south ro and ran north, (which is how he did it with his
last group, he said).  The rest of us beamed into north ro and ran south. He
did the same thing on the return trip even though we VERY SPECIFICALLY SAID RUN
NORTH!!!  (Personally I would have just run to the Gypsy camp in Oasis to sell
but with so few of us having a clue where we were I wasn't even going to
suggest it.)
I'm not sure it was intentional even now... but as I said, I'll *never* venture
far from the looter again.
