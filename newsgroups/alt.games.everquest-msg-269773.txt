I can't see it as a difficult task from a  programming perspective. There's
too many examples of masks being used (for example in tracking, the market)
for them not to be able to filter out all but those quests flagged for that
zone. Not seeing what database structure they use for quests, i can't be
sure, but unless they are doing something weird, it's a trivial task for
them.

I have feedbacked that since day 1.
