Having just reached 30, I'm struggling a bit to work out which spells to
keep Mem'd now, so many to choose from ;) Seems like I spent the weekend
forever forgetting & memorizing because the ones I wanted just weren't
there!

Continuing my level 22+ practice of keeping the spells I use in combat
Mem'd, and leaving a couple of slots free for specials & longer lasting
buffs, here's what I have currently:

Permanent:
Ignite
Light Healing
Snare
Stinging Swarm (I'm sure it will work one day!)
Shield of Thistles
Firefist

Then in the bottom 2 slots, as required:
SoW        (usually Mem'd)
Camouflage
Panic Animal
Barbcoat
Strength of Earth
Invigor
Skin Like Rock
+ others rarely

Comments and advice appreciated!

Aside: my first task once I made 30 was to track & kill the Ghoul Messenger
for my SSOM. He took me down to 10% health but I held out! If only I had
remembered Magic Arrows & bought some Magic Boots!
