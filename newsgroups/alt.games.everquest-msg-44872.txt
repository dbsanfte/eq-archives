   I had no problem viewing you website with IE but then again I use
AdSubtract Pro. It blocks pop up windows, cookies, auto-refreshes, banner
adds, and much much more. I love the program, nothing finer than viewing a
website with nothing but content showing. In fact why don't you guys check
it out for yourselves at www.adsubtract.com . No I get nothing for plugging
them I just love the program that much, I even paid for the registration
*lol*.
