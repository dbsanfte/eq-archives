Because it is not supposed to be the same as getting 200+ in a
fighting skill. I think most people with GM tradeskillers items want
them as status symbol at least as much as they want them for stats.

And it is possible to learn tradeskills without fucking up your wrist.
You just do small portions in each sitting. If you truly wanted to GM
a tradeskill, you would find ways around wearing your wrists out, as I
have. (Heck, I find tradeskills are nice when my left wrist hurts from
too much raid/fighting hotkey work.) The only thing excluding you from
becoming a GM tradeskiller is that you don't want to - and that is the
way it should be.
