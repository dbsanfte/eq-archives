I was also involved in this project.  I chose a beastlord for similar
reasons.  A beastlord's DPS comes from several sources - pet, spells
and personal weapons.  Only the beastlord's personal DPS scales with
gear.  At the high end, this can cause problems, since high-end gear
doesn't give a BST the same return as it does to many other classes
(e.g. BST do not have double attack, so a spiffier melee weapon is less
effective, in our hands).  At the low end, I figured the division of
power would work in my favor, diluting my relative weakness.

I agree.  I think the problem was that we were unified only by our
commitment to a playing style.  Every other guild I have joined
happened because I met someone in-game, which necessarily requires us
to have similar playing times, at least.  Heck, it took me a week or
two just to get a guild invite, because of playtime conflicts.  It
didn't help that my playtime was casual, at best, to begin with.
Still, it was fun to spend time looking at the low-end rewards and
trying to find attainable drops for upgrades.
