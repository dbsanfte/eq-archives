i will be shortly buying a new system-the following is pretty much
what i've settled on, unless I hear some real neg. feedback-primary
use will be eq
Athalon 2100
asus mb (the upgraded one, cant member name right now)
512 ddr ram, choice of 266 or 333 speed (do i have those numbers
right, something like that)
asus Gforce 4 ti4200 128 ram vid card
soundblaster live 5.1
basic 5 pkge speakers
windows exp home vesion
rest of stuff not relevant to eq
cable connection
Anyone out there have a system similar to this? any known problems
with this rig? I'm not a puter expert so any heads up, good or bad
would be usefull 
Appreciate any feedback, -Ironeyes-45 dwf clr-Rathe
(i want to get lucin so i can get to bazzar :)!!
