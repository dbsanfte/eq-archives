I agree that you were prolly in walk mode by accident but I have experienced
a similiar thing.

I have a Human Pal and a Human Monk, both with run3, with or without SOE,
the Pal consistantly outruns the monk, not by much but enough where if it
was an entire zone run the monk would loose autofollow. No lag issue, tested
in empty zone facing the ground, nor a weight issue. Even tried switching
PC's so the monk was on the pal pc and pal on monk pc, same results. Just
interesting...
