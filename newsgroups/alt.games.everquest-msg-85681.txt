Take your level and divide it by 5. That is how many mana points
you get per wisdom point. Up to level 50 and 200 wisdom.

It 'used' to be that you only got 1 point per wisdom point over 200,
this was called the soft cap. However, they recently improved this
to about 6 (5.8) mana per wisdom from 200 to 255. 255 is the hard
cap.
