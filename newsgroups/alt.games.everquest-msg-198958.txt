Apparently.  :-p  I still don't see where I opened myself to that
particular bit.

But, but...  That's unAmerican!  It's his right to whine!

It doesn't look to me as if we have a whole lot to argue about here.
I have a bit more sympathy for the "for donations" people than you do
(probably residual gratitude for the casters who willingly accepted a
couple gold for a bind from my perennially broke melees back in the
"good old days"), hardly a good starting point for a raging argument.
We'll just have to try again on some other topic.  ;)
