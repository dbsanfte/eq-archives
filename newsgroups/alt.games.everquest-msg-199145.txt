>If you were only high enough level to take on blue mobs..

It seems conning blue means little as one go up in lvl.  Some blue can
outright kill you on the spot.  Some blue can be taken out.  Taking out some
blue hardly give you any exp!

>you could kill the roughly 4 centurions that stand in your way.

I thought about taking them out.  But if they turned out to be the killer
blue, safe zoning points are too far away you know.
