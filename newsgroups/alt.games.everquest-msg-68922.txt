 Hmm....I guess I should have looked back for other post on the
subject. Didn't know there was a ongoing dialog.... The char in the
original post (Warrior) STA is 130 un buffed.  So, What happens if STA
goes to zero, char passes out ?, turns various colors ?, commits
suicide ?, refuses to play anymore, gets sick and regurgitates ? or
maybe nothing?
