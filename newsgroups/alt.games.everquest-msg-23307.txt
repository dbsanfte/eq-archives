 Apparently some skills require practice points to be invested in them
before they will go up with use, but others don't.
 Sense Heading doesn't need any investment of points before it starts
going up, just practice, but Taunt does.
 Is there any list of which skills need to be started this way, or does
everyone find out by trial and error?
