No, the other guilds won't be grateful, since LoS has an excellent
reputation on The Nameless, and generally gets along well with us non-uber
players.  I remember when Verant beefed up CT and Inny, bringing the
uberguilds back to PoH and PoF.  On many servers, this screwed over the
guilds that were doing those zones, because the ubers stomped all over them
to get to CT and Inny.  On The Nameless, on the other hand, we lesser guilds
*hoped* that LoS would come for CT or Inny while we were in the Planes,
because they made sure to avoid killing the mobs that we could handle, and
when they killed the ones that we could not handle, they'd always let the
non-uber guilds have the loot--they were there just for CT and Inny loot.

What rule did they break?  They'd already killed the "hard" mobs in the
zone.  All they did was skip 20-30 minutes of CoH'ing past the zone timesink
mobs, by using techniques that Verant says are OK on other mobs in other
zones (hell, Verant says warping the Dain is how the Dain fight is
*designed*, so it is not unreasonable to expect that the techique is legal
in general).

If the GM had told them "excuse me, but in *this* zone, we consider doing
what you are about to do an exploit", based on how I've seen them behave in
the past, they would not done it.  They would have bitched about the silly
inconsistency, of course, but they would have obeyed (and it is too bad
Tigole retired...his rants were way better).
