Happen to know just how much?  I suppose I can set up some tests again to
puzzle it out, but if the works already done why bother...

Seems like it would be most useful against a mob with lots of hp and not many of
you pounding on it, has to have a long life expectancy to be really effective.  A
real DS lets you engage multiple targets so no one of em has to live all that long.

Lets see, to beat Reckoning, the MoR will have to do at least 308 points of
damage.  If its does 30 points per blow thats just 10 blows, but if its only hmm,
6 points its 50 blows.

And of course slapping a DS on someone doesn't create aggro while MoR likely
annoys the heck out of the target...
