Dugroz doesn't aggro if you kill the other frogs.  If you are thinking of
going to HS then you really do not need to worry about a couple of green
frogs...just kill them. :)

Yes, you may have to worry about being KOS to Dugroz so if you have a druid
friend, have them cast wolf form on you and you should be fine.

BIG THING:  MAKE SURE YOU ARE GIVING THE THINGS TO DUGROZ AND NOT HIS PET.
His pet wanders up & down and sometimes gets in your way.  If you give it to
the pet you will lose the items and not get your key.
