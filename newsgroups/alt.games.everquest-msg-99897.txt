That's an incredibly bad analogy.  But thanks for playing.

Druids don't have "menus" that people can see.  Strike one.

He didn't "go to a place" that couldn't provide him the
service, he *advertised* for anyone who *could* provide
the service.  Strike two.

The person who purported to provide the service could provide
only an alternative product, and yet didn't bother to point
this fact out before delivering the alternative, which
wouldn't be the case if you tried to order a chicken salad
sandwich at a store which didn't serve them.  Strike three.

You're out.

To be more like the current situation, your stupid "your fault"
analogy would better be described as, "You advertise for a
caterer who can deliver a chicken salad sandwich, one
responds and says, 'sure, I can do that', then when lunchtime
comes he gives you a sandwich and you say, 'hey, this is tuna,
I specifically asked for chicken salad!', and the caterer
responds, 'look, that's the closest I could get, what are
you bitching about, where's my money?'"

Now -- who's fault would *that* be?


>I'd say there's no room to complain.

And you'd be wrong about that, too.

Horse shit.  Most of them may be "well known" to people who
have been playing the game for upwards of a year or more
(and even so, I have guildmates with 50+ characters ask me
for the locations of some of the lesser-used portals),
but they're hardly "well known" to anyone who has been
playing for less than six months.

You make it sound like everyone was born with the
locations of all the dozens of EQ portals etched into
their brains.  You're speaking nonsense.

>transport you, then you know you're not getting directly to Gfay.

And you magically "know" this *how*?  Especially when
"the guy" has answered your call for someone to port you
to GFay, and replies, "yeah, I can port you there, sure"?

Furthermore, even if you are familiar enough with the
game to recognize that the respondent is a druid and can't
port you to GFay, there's the issue of him having WASTED
YOUR TIME.  Most druids go /anon, which means that you
won't realize that he can't actually take you where you
requested to go *until* you've trekked halfway across
the zone to meet up with him.  /rude.

Is that your attitude, "screw the newbies,
they deserve to 'pay a price' for not knowing as much
about the game as other people"?  Don't be a jerk.
