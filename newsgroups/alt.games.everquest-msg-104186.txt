Zombie grinders? Like it or not, oasis-loio-fm-ot-dl are the easiest zones
to find a pickup group. Im not going to some dungeon to sit on my hands for
hours trying to get in a group, or even find the place totally empty (lguk
is regularly on our server). besides the xp, its as boring as hell sitting
around LFG.

Also, if dungeon newbies should be staying out of dungeons, how is anyone
ever meant to learn? Lessons?
