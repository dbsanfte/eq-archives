I like the new wood-elf and half-elf chain looks (on male models 
anyway), and half-elf plate looks good (except helm looks goofy), and 
the ogres definitely did ok.  Have to agree with the poster who thought 
the erudites lost out tho, old model erudites looked nice, new ones look 
sorta like old saturday morning cartoons redone by a (very) mildly 
talented wannabe artist.  And why do the barbarians and pretty much all 
females have their necks bent and their heads thrust forward?  looks 
really stupid.  I expect I'll end up with all but a very few turned off.
