Highly impressive actually.

Small groups and/or easy mobs now have definite clerical benefit, as
well as scalability for multiple clerics. Nice change.

Coupled with the added experience bonus in tougher groups, clerics now
*seem* to have a viable position in all 4 areas of the game (solo, easy
group, tough group, raid) I'll let the clerics themselves deliver the
final verdict though

Note the word *now*. Before this patch, it was the cleric who had the
stick. Take off the procs, reduce the pet damage appropriately, and then
look at the dps. These changes were a HUGE boon, and I'll stand by my
comments made before them.
