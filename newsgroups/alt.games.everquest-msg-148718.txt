Besides everyone else's advice, if you are a true masochist, may I suggest
the Thurgadin Shawl quests to you?

This requires high levels of ALL tradeskills, except the race and class
specific ones. Here's a link to describe them:
http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/intro.htm and the rest of the site is the
Mecca of all tradeskillers.

Since you are an enchanter, you will not need to rely on others for many
things, and I envy that. But not everyone can do the various tradeskills to
high levels without going simply mad.
