Its been rumored on several message boards that the nerf to KEI, to
make it similar to Spirit of Eagles in which you cant cast it on
someone of a lower level, is upcoming in the next patch. Didnt hear if
it was thursdays patch or just something thats in the works to even
the playing field for melees. Without the nerf isnt C3 sort of like
casting a long lasting uber health regen, haste and str buff on a
melee? Why group with casters when you can whup ass on mobs all day
solo then run to bazaar to get "Augmentation of the Uber" cast on you
for 10pp.
