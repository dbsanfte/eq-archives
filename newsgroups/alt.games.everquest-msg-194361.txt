Before? Nor I, but given the choice of AAs available as a bard, these are
the only two I would consider at all.  Run 1/2/3 first for obvious reasons
and if you have aa points readily available then yes -- regen for the exact
reason Rob mentioned (swarm kiting etc).  A nice natural regen does indeed
help for the times you get knocked around a bit due to lag, getting stuck on
something or just bad driving :)  I think regen or something like an iksar
cer. bp helps immensely.

For further views on bard AA, however, this NG is not the place.  The forums
at www.dotnetdiva.com have loads of info on distribution of AA points.

Cheers!
