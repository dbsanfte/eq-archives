Odd that you say that...according to CWA, the spear actually does about 20 more
damage per minute.

It's ALL about the ratio for us
>(especially offhand).

Not really. Rogues are quite a bit more dependant on the damage of a weapon
than you seem to think.

Level 40 Rogue & warrior
130 Str
FBSS

Trakasaur's Tooth Primary (10/20 pierce)
SSOY (8/24 1hs) secondary
Rogue=1252 DPM
Warrior (using 10/20)=770 DPM


Slime Coated Harpoon (10/25 pierce)
SSOY
Rogue=1137 DPM
Warrior=654 DPM

Jagged Ice Shard (12/29 pierce)
SSOY
Rogue=1217 DPM
Warrior=646 DPM

Crystalline Spear (13/30 pierce)
SSOY
Rogue=1273 DPM
Warrior=657 DPM

Carved Velium Spear (11/20 pierce)
SSOY
Rogue=1336 DPM
Warrior=809 DPM

Looks like a lot more than 30% to me.

>something else had, say, 7 dmg
>but only 15 delay I'd be on it in a flash.  It's ALL about the ratio for us
>(especially offhand).

Um....why? a 7/15 for a rogue would do poor damage. Just to make sure:

Imaginary 7/15 (7/15 pierce)
SSOY
Rogue=1153
Warrior=802

...Yep. In fact, it does even less than a Slime-coated Harpoon.

And another plus to having large-damage large-delay weapon for rogues (e.g.
Crystalline Spear) is that they taunt a lot less than, for example, a Trak
Tooth.
