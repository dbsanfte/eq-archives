I was grouping with Pallys and SKs back in their 30s and 40s (
velious/kunark era) and back then they really did suck. Neither one
could tank as well as a monk and paladins didn't really bring anything
to the table. At least a SK with a circlet of shadows was always (once
he had FD) an awesome puller who could also snare. 

Since I watched those knights grow up, I can tell you exactly when a
SK got powerful, it started around 50th lvl and they just kept getting
better all the way to 60, their spell, extra AA and agro control when
PoP came out was just the icing on the cake. Paladins always had it
tougher from what I saw, mid 50s was when they started to catch up to
warriors and not until PoP would I have taken one in a pickup group
over a warrior.

Exactly.
