Well, that's quite an over-exaggeration, but it does illustrate a design 
decision with which I, for one, agree. Otherwise, money would be coming out 
everyone's ears.

Huh. I never much got the idea that they encouraged botting. It always just 
seemed more to me like a choice the players made themselves. The macro 
system in place seems pretty consistent with most other MMORPG's where 
functionality is concerned. In fact, they intentionally prevented recursive 
macroing, so I wouldn't say they encourage botting, especially where 
tradeskills are concerned.
