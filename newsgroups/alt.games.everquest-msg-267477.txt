Your first room is free to 'buy', but the rent is 5 silver a week.

Better living quarters cost money to buy, and have a higher rent.

If you don't pay the rent, you get locked out, but don't lose it.  I
don't think it's cumulative, so you take 4 weeks off and owe 4 week's
rent when you return.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
