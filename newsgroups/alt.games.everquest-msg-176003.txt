I don't know where you got that one. There are people who like Sol A.
It's PLers that make it tough there.

Go to Lake Rathe, or WW, those are real unused zones. When you hit a
red, and get exp the ZEM doesn't matter much because I suspect there
is a exp limit per kill.

You have a druid, use the zones where the druid works better.

That is better advice, but I would suggest doing dire wolves in GD.
Easy to get to, and still red. Like I said ZEM doesn't matter.

This is beter advice, or hit the Recuso. I suggest here with a druid.
