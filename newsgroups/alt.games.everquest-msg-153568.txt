Yeah I got mine MQ'd, but I've helped guildies several times in the past
track/kill it.  Back when VP was a priority for us (year or so ago) we used
to have people always keeping tabs on the AJ

That sucks, maybe he just had bad luck.  Its a random pop with a PH so in
theory it could take 5 mins or 50 hours...  but he's not a part of the quest
that guildies whined about getting (in the same way people whined about the
Pained Soul)

"Agree this was a pain spawn.. but thats 1 part, not plural timesinks"  - I
agreed this one is usually a timesink

I can see 1 and a half years ago people would camp this and it being another
time sink, but why would a lot of people have VP as a priority *now*?

Just because its not near a scion doesn't make it a time sink.   Port to EJ,
run 2 zones.

Dearic...

You of all people know what MB is, and what it can do (before its
up-and-coming nerf).
Why is 4 wizards killing trak not realistic?   I mean heck, TWO wizards
could kill trak, but taking the risk of them both critting MB is a huge
gamble

As for the VS trio, I don't think I ever made a claim that they were or
weren't uber...  this was velious era, so they werent uber in the sense of
AA abilities and VT gear (it was the servers number 1 guild though,  so they
did have ntov gear).  It was pre-Tunare and AoW killings.

We killed Innoruk with 1 and a half groups the other day (using a MA, heals
etc, not just MBing him)...
greater numbers != victory

Does it need to be instant-pop for you to not classify it as a time sink?

Camping verix means doing Karnors basement, which means killing mobs that
are still blue at level 60.  Thats a pretty good way to pass the time, imo.
And theres more than enough skeles to kill (it can support full ae groups)
