Use backspace.  It's better than nothing.

This is easy.  <ctrl><up-arrow>, <ctrl><home> (moves cursor to start of 
line) <move cursor up 4 spaces> <delete 2 characters (space and g)> 
<enter>.  It's not perfect, but being able to at least move to the start 
or end of a line is a HUGE upgrade.  Believe us, it used to be a LOT 
worse.

Go to the official boards, request it there.  It's been an issue since the 
beginning, and it is slowly being improved.
