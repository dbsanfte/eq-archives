That's your choice.

That is not my argument, I was using sarcasm to poke fun at the people who
were saying "why should I bother playing Everquest for the next year if EQ2
will be out then".

OK, this has been said by others, but I'm gonna repeat it once: it will be
IMPOSSIBLE to transfer the characters from EQ1 to EQ2. This is absolute. You
will not see Verant later offer transfers at $50 a pop as a "value added"
service. This is a technical issue. It's the exact same reason you can't
convert a Diablo1 character to Diablo2, the character creation and
development systems are completely different. Also, you would be creating a
skewed economy; remember, that's the reason they clear your inventory when
transfering your character from one server to another.
