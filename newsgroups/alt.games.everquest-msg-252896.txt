Aye, they will.  But as he levels up to where the risk involved decreases, 
the net gain per kill is also gonna decrease.  And fairly proportionately.

Actually, it's exactly what they're for.  Normally, the guard gets to 
finish the kill and swipe the exp, is all.  If I'm a newbie shadowknight 
running around in Nektulos, and one of those dang guards tries to swipe 
-my- skeleton, but I manage to outdamage the guard and get the final hit, 
surely you wouldn't say then that I'd exploited the guard?

Heh, aye, I remember training Grimfeather to the guards on the hill... 
resulting in two dead guards and a soft enough Grimfeather for me to 
finish off. :)

Yea, well, it just -isn't- very efficient, so I doubt there's much risk of 
that. :)

Only if you're going to call creating an enchanter 85% an exploit. :) 
What're bards, 95%? :)

Note that being efficient wouldn't make it illegitimate, either.

Charm kiting isn't necessarily swarm kiting.  Unless you consider two mobs 
a 'very small swarm'. :)

My bard sucks at swarm kiting.  But charm kiting a mob, she can manage. :)
