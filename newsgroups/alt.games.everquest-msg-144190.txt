I am a right-wing Christian, however.  Extremist is open to interpretation.
According to mass media, I would qualify.  Of course, mass media also thinks
they're moderate, so YMMV.

Hasn't gotten much press yet, which is very suprising, considering what
possiblities it opens up.

Ok, here's a question (I side with the ACLU in the above case, btw, but it
does raise an issue).  Are you suggesting that it's absurd that they're
taking seriously the charge that a spell was cast to make the teacher ill?
If so, what's the point of being Wiccan?  I've known other "witches" who
publically discount magik.  It seems like they're saying one thing in
public, and another in private.  Maybe there's something I'm just not
understanding.

Dunno, it seems to be only a matter of degree.  Of course, I also deal with
alot of automotive fanatics, so comparing your father's Ford to a new one
would be a 180 reversal...
