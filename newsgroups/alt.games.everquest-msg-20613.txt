Oh, most of the time it'll be buffs, I'm sure.  I hear calls for
STR/DEX/AGI/HP all the time, plus, of course, SOW.  Well, that's 5
slots...you still have 3 left. :)

As for levitate, tell 'em you're out of bat wings.  And don't worry, if this
newsgroup is any indication people get sick of that buff after a while
(except necros).
