> When do Shaman get to start using Adept version of spells?

Spell scrolls are not level restricted, they are skill based so as soon as 
you have the required skill (e.g., Fetishes 50) you can scribe the scroll. 
Examine the spell scroll to see its requirements. Generally speaking, the 
requirements are so low (typically 5 or higher) that it's almost never an 
issue and if you have the spell in the first place, you're going to be able 
to upgrade to any upgraded version that's available (App III, Adept I, Adept 
III).

The tricky part is going to be finding the dropped Adept I, or being able to 
afford the costly Adept III (minimally 1g, some sell for 5g). Get used to 
the idea that for the vast majority of your character's life most of your 
spells are going to be upgraded to App III, a few of them will be Adept I's 
and very, very few will be Adept IIIs, and only if you are lucky enough to 
find one of the rare components needed to make an Adept III.
