I believe that if you transfer your current character from EQ1 to EQ2, you
will miss out on some things...

For example, what new skills, spells, items and creatures will you be to
high of a level to take on now? You will miss things that if you had created
a character from scratch. Some of the new enjoyment and excitment of having
to start anew again...
