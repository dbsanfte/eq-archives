This is a question about the "Whistling Fists", not to be confused with the
Celestial Fists which are the monk epic.

Ok i currently have done both trials where i fight grand master glox and the
trial where i fight master rinmark in TD. I am now on trial of patients. I
have all the items for it, I collected them first b4 I started this trial. I
give my shackles of steel to a guy in kaesora to start it (he gives me a
tomb). I have tried to turn the stuff in allready b4. Npc's in cabilis ate
my items up and I needed a GM to give them back..Well i have them back now.
I just need to know exactley how to turn this stuff in. If you have done
this b4, please give me insight. Say I get a tomb from the guy in kaesora
for turning in my shackles of steel and the tomb tells me to to do the bs
with qwinn the outlander making the mechanical iksar tail (just example),
and it says to do the qwinn the outlander thing and turn into Master Niska
for example. Do I give master Niska the Tomb and the mechanical iksar tail
to result in another tomb?  what confuses me is walkthrus for it (inc one on
monkley bussiness) after some of the items it says turn in item to <whoever>
and then after some it says turn in tomb and item to <whoever>. I have done
this the first time and the npc's ate my items.. One npc gave me an item
back in return (the mark of clarity) taht was suppose to be givin to me from
a tottally different npc. Some gave me Exp and no items in return. One even
gave me exp and said "thank you blah blah, take this green stone for what
you have done" or whatever and I diddnt even get the green stone in my
inventory. This quest broke? Am I doing something wrong? I have everything
back and do not wanna try this again ontil i know more about it. I know some
of you are saying screw the whistling fists, just get epic..Well I am doing
it just for the hell of it. Please if u know any information; reply.  Thanks
in advance
