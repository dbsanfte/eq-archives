I was just wondering what kind of gear my Barbarian Beastlord should have at
level 14. Right now, I'm wearing all the quest armor that I got from the
beeastlords in Halas. All my other armor is just the tattered leather stuff
I made from bear or cat pelts. I was using the claw I got from the quest but
a friend gave me a stone fist thing that hits for more damage and adds some
hit points.

I've got a little less than 60 platinum and I'm on Maellin Starpyre. What
should I buy and where? Am I better off sticking with what I have and
upgrading later?
