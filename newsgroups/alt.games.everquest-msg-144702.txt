I do hope that you cease to be amused by that sort of childishness
at some point in your life.  "Potty mouth" is the sport of small
children, often reprised by young adolescents.  It is not clever or
creative, and it is not even vaguely original.  12 year-olds have
been snickering at precisely what you just posted for decades, if
not centuries.  Fortunately, some of them have managed to grow up.
