Extremely different. Wizard nukes always "stacked", i.e. two wizards
could always shoot ice comets at a mob until it dropped. (Or the wizards
did, of course.) However, two necros could not cast Boiling Blood on the
same mob. Only the first one would land. Nor could one cast a lower
level dot of the same "line" since the higher would overwrite it. So
dual necros had to reduce their damage arsenal and agree which one would
cast which of their dots.  

Now, if there are three dots of good power available to the necros on a
given mob, rather than Necro_01 casting two of them, and Necro_02
casting one of them for a total of three, they can both cast all three
for a total of six. That's some seriously withering damge if you look at
post fifty necro dots and toss in a couple of rogue or monk pets on the
mobs.
