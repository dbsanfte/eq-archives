I usually try to do that and nobody responds and it pisses me off. 
First of all, lately I've been in camps with constant pulls.  So if I'm
not casting I'm medding.  Well people keep looting as we go.  I mention
that I need a cut of the action as I'm trying to keep people alive, so
I'm not looting.  Nobody does or says anything about it.  Last night I
started just looting as I went.  We had to stop more often, but it looks
like I *might* have enough money for my level 24 spells today.
