Well I don't think this comparison works well. One is a game, that you
may or may not want to play, but overall it won't have a big effect on
your real life no matter what happens. The other one is a matter of
life and death.

And I could come up with a counter-example: What if I had some rare
cancer and an experimental drug exists. I'm terminally ill, I'll die
anyway at some near point in the future (hypothetically speaking
here). Now, I'd be pretty pissed if the government told me I couldn't
try the drug because of this or that concern, because it hasn't been
tested etc. or because it wasn't "fair" or something like that. In
that case I'd be more than happy to use my life savings to pay for a
chance to be their guinea pig if that option existed. Wouldn't you? --
But again I don't think this is a good representation of the situation
here.

Apparently there is a big demand from people to beta test EQ2. It's a
sellers market therefore. But what they have to offer is not a
necessity in any way, nor are they monopolizing anything here.
Therefore, in my book at least, they are free to "sell it" as they see
fit, and at a price the market is willing to pay. They are even
comming our way, by giving every EQ player with an account in good
standing an equal chance to be part of the beta-testing anyway, free
of charge - and they don't need to do that at all (but admittedly this
has advantages for them too).

The game they are bundling it with costs $49.99 in the US. While
that's about normal for a newly released game, I don't think many
people will fork over that much cash just to be in the beta test -
which I'm sure comes with an NDA - so you only get minnimal braggin
rights. Legends subscribers get a chance to beta test it even before
those that buy the game. That to me shows that it really is just a
marketing move to push the people that would have 'maybe' bougth the
game to actually go out and buy it. I don't think it's any different
than many of the other marketing offers other companies make (such as
discounts, free memberships, tickets to some event, collectors items
etc.). I don't see it as them trying to sell access to the beta test
at all in fact. It's a well used marketing tool in my book. Plus, it
stirred some controversy which caused me to find out about a game I
would otherwise probably never have looked at. Good marketing if you
ask me. But not unethical as far as I can tell.
