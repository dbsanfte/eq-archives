One thing that card doesn't seem to handle well (I have the Abit variant of
the same card) is the zone from Field of Bone to Cablis. If you take the elft
tunnel, as soon as you zone in your are facing a blank wall and have to turn
right, and the card chokes, gasps and wheezes trying to display the tunnel
ahead fro some obscene reason i can't comprehend. That said, it is overall a
fantastic card for the money and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better
price/performance value for EQ.
