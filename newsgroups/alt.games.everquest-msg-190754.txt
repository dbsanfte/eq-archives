I have to admit that your post made me smile. You have this down to a
science! I'm just going to have to be patient I guess to get where I'm
going. I'm currently having fun anyway soloing my 25 Paladin in
Warsliks Woods, sneaking from camp to camp, killing goblins, Iksar and
giants. It's pretty fun when you know there is serious danger of them
ganging up on you. You should see me sneaking through the woods trying
to stay out of sight until I'm ready to strike! If I tried to double
box there I'd just get both of my characters killed.
