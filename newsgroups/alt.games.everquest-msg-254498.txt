    Wonder if they fixed the cleric AA as well. I was critting over a
thousand points higher than normal with Supernal Light, and I hear that
people were getting crits as high as 11 K with it.

    Drat. It would have been a really nifty item otherwise. The right-click
on it is equivalent to Vexing Mordinia, the level 56 lifetap DoT. Imagine
