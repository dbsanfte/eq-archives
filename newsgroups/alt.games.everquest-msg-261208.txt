Check the EQ Live forums -  lots of people with Win98/98SE/ME are
complaining of the same issue with the sky - it's in the 'Eternal Night'
thread. It's happening to me too.

Looks like SoE forgot Win9x/ME was still being used. It's probably going to
be something like when Luclin was released and people with Win95 were forced
to upgrade to Win9x (or higher) to keep playing.

Radeon/Geforce cards with DirectX 9.0b/c - it doesn't matter. The only
similar thing for all cases is that the people reporting the problem(s) are
running Win98/98SE/ME.
