Ok I'm gonna take a wild stab here and totally disagree with the
majority of the thread. I don't see anything wrong with what they are
doing at all, and I don't really understand people's complaints
either.

- You are not loosing ANYTHING by them doing this.
- You are gaining the ability to buy your way into the beta, which I
know is something some people want, and I know some of the people
here, (possibly including myself) will take them up on the offer.
- They have a product, with such good marketing that people are
willing to pay money to play it before it's done, and released.
Everybody choosing to do this KNOWS this, and still wants it. How can
you be upset about that? They are giving some of their customers an
option they wanted.

They are a company, and they are interested in making money. This
seems neither unfair to anybody nor give anybody unfair advantages.

And yes they'll make money on the side. Hopefully it will go to a
couple more full time testers and full time bug fixers for EQ2.
Developing a game like that is not cheap..
