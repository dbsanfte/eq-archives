There's tons of good armor quests in Shadeweavers for Vah Shir.  I did
the same thing myself recently.  Also when you get up a little in level
the Bandits in Shadeweavers can drop some nice bronze - starting around
12th I think.  I fiannly got burned out at 20th lv. on the bard, just
because my hands started to hurt too much.

I'd suggest checking Allakazim for Shadeweaver & your home city quests.

If you get really strapped for cash there's a little quest that will net
you 3-8pp in your home city, just look for a little lost girl kitty and
take her home.
