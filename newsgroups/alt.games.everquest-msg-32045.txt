That's the guides for you. I've had actual GMs respond to petitions
where I've spelled out the problems... They've never asked "how can I
help you?"...

Something aside the point, but: Had a gm help me once without even
being asked. I'd lost my corpse in SK, wasn't near any notable
landmarks, and didn't have time to do a /loc... I'd asked a few times
for help from a necro, bard, or SK in /ooc, but no one replied. After
a few tries, I suddenly found myself standing over my corpse in a
blink. Never saw the gm, and I'm pretty sure they weren't supposed to
do that, so I remained quiet and looted up. ;-)
