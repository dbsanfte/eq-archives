I sometimes get to pair up with necros in skyfire (with my druid). Its a
very powerful combination, and the abilities of each compliment one another
really well. The druids ensnare is what necros really need, and the necros
lich line is great combined with regen/chloro. Regrowth+SLN is 17/tic
health, so your'e looking at +8 mana/round (better than clarity).

That said, xp is still faster in a good group. You will get a char in a
group from 20 to 50 in the loio/fm/ot/dl cycle a lot faster (assuming its a
group friendly char) than a necro/druid partnering. (40-50 the druid can do
it faster on his own quad kiting) After that it is even more in favor of the
grouping char. Grouping in Velks or Sebilis just blows away the necro/druid
combination for xp.

Dont expect to be able to get into groups as a necro, and probably not as a
druid either post 50. There are uses for high level druids... snaring and
evacs mainly. Finding a group would be much easier as a melee class, cleric,
shaman, enchanter, and probably as wizard and mage too. Good guilds
generally dont want necros and druids either. necro might get in if he has
the new summon corpse spell that uses the stackable coffins. My own guild
has a lvl 57 requirement for druids, which is higher than any other class...
that just about sums up druids popularity.
