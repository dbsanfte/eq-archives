Do you have LoY?  If so, grab the maps others have pointed to, the map 
for warrens that is included is quite decent.  If not, the keep left idea 
should work until you get to the bat lord room, it is recognizable by the 
mound in the center, which is where he spawns, and the big bats 
surrounding the mound.  In that room, you want the rightmost exit, go 
past the first right, then keep right, that should get you to stonebrunt.  
That's all going by memory here.
