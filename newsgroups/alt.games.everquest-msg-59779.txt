And worth it, I guess, for most people.  I don't carry around a lot of heavy
stuff on my enchanter or druid (my primaries) and they each have a
tinkerer's bag to handle it.  Most of my other stuff is very light, and an
8-slot just won't do it anymore.  But I can definitely see the value in the
bag.
