Why? Before the wording said "GMs have no choice, you WON'T get your
rez/items". Now the wording says "GMs can decide, they might give you
back your xp/items". Why should the door opening bother you? Or is it
that you really have nothing better to do than to complain about what
can only really be a posative change? What, actually, has only been a
change in the "official" stand, and probably won't impact practice at
all?
