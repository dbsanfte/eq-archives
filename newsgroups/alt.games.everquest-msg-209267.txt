I disagree, and think you were just being particularly cautious, and to an
extent manufacturing your own unnecessary downtime.for simple zone
*traversal* I doubt you needed your pet fully buffed and equipped... all you
typically needed was something that could take a punch or two while you put
some distance between you and the mobs/buy you time to gate.  I'm sure you
can come up with specific zones where this isn't the case... but on the
average 10 or 15 zone trip maybe one or two tops required this sort of
preparation...

I've done enough naked melee corpse recoveries to be quite confident I can
traverse most outdoor zones safely without any equipment, pets, or buffs.
Particularly old world zones, which is where pok primarily trivialized
travel.

All that said, I'm on your side... I htink pets should have zoned with their
masters. Although I don't think its worth paying SOE the price of an
expansion to fix it either....
