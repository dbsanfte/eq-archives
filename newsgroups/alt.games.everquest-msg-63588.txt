Tukka, you are a vet of the group and I believe extremely knowledgable.  You
mentioned I could upgrade my video card for $100.  I went shopping around
yesterday with doubts in my mind that the Rage Fury Pro did not have
hardware T&L, Sisoft's Sandra and 3dMark2001 concurred with those doubts and
what you have just said.  Bow, that blows goats.

Having said that, I was looking at the ATI Radeon 7000 which I would assume
supports harware T&L, albeit, I could not find anything within its
specifications that specifically state whether or not it is or isn't.

http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/radeon_7000/index.html

I do have a GeForce2 MX on hand in an even slower machine (the PLing
machine), I put it there because honestly, I enjoyed the video output of the
ATI Rage Fury Pro over it when I first got it to somewhat replace the ATI...
soo.. <shrug>  Though the GeForce2 MX -does- support hardware T&L, but, I
still dont like the output on it not to mention it received a rating lower
of that of the ATI card using 3dMark2001.  Go figure.

Anyway, in short, what card were you suggesting for $100.00.  Its a decent
price (dont have $300 or even $200 to spend on a video card JUST for EQ) to
pay for a new video card though, being more expensive than the Radeon 7000 I
was looking at today, I suspect its probably better yet.  Any suggestions
from you or ANYONE as to what card they would suggest and its approximate
price as well as where I can find it (I'm on the East Coast which I suppose
only matters if its not suggested via a web based company).

I am of course getting my copy of SoL tomorrow and I'm going to see how the
GeForce2 MX handles it USING the new character models (I dont imagine it
will handle things with much ease, but, hey, I wanna atleast turn on the new
character models once to see what its all about) then will more than likely
turn them off (or will be more less forced too <grin>) until I get me a
better card.

One last note.  I should tell you or anyone reading (in which will hopefully
reply with their knowledge) this post that I haven't a clue what I'm looking
at usually when looking at the specifications of a video card.  Sure as hell
would be nice for ATI to make a simple comparison chart.. or anyone for that
matter as I have yet to find one.  <shrug>

Good day and have a blast in SoL!  :)
