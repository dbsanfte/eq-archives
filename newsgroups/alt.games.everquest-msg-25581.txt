Story of my life, babe. And it's always served me well. :-)

Yep. That's not to say we don't have people who have *been to* the planes, but
we _as a guild_ have not lead such a thing and just don't have the guns to mount
such an event.

I'd say you can't. At least not in the traditional sense. Hence the problem and
the questions posed.

Not really. Having friends up as high as 58, and reading as much as I can here,
and in other places, I think I have a fairly good idea of what's left in front
of me, and it's a lot.  Granted, the fanciful "get me into Sleepers by
Christmas" comment was obviously a gross exaggeration, but it does sort of
quantify what I and some of the other 40's & 50's in the guild are facing.
We'll either find a way to make some progress *in that direction* between now
and then, or we'll be forced to move on, either to an established higher level
guild, or forming one of our own, or..... whatever the other options are.

Thanks for the input. But getting away from fantasy, day-dreaming land, it would
be rather nice to see them get to the point where we could field two full groups
to go into Old Seb without getting TPW'd by then, eh?
