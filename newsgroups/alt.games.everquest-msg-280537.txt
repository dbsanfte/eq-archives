Quite. I got on the OC wagon back in the glory days of the Celeron 300A 
and still keep my hands in.

But this machine wasn't overclocked. Seeq's post was (presumably) about 
performance levels while 4-boxxing EQ. The selection of thermal 
components; the various fans, heatsinks, and even the Arctic Silver made 
his system quieter. Not faster.

Its good information, but its definately into enthusiast detail 
overkill.

Even if his system was overclocked, it would have been adequate to 
simply mention that it was an 3ghz northwood p4 OC'd to 3.63ghz with an 
aftermarket performance cooling solution. If someone wanted to know 
about Zalmans and Arctic Silver, RAM timing, and BIOS settings, they 
would have derailed and asked... but I'm not trying to be some sort of 
usenet cop...and I'm not saying he shouldn't have posted it all. I don't 
have any issue with what Seeq posted... I just found it amusing. :)

Like I said... I've been guilty of it myself.
