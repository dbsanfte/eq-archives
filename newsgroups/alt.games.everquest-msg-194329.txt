I'm in a mostly European based guild, "Legions of Valhalla".  Guildmotd and
everything else is posted in GMT.  Sadly minimum level varies from 56 to 60
depending on class and how well represented / in demand that class is for
us, so its not for you for quite a few more levels.

Personally I live in the US, but I get a good deal of "play time" in the
mornings, which means a guild of people who think its "evening" then is very
handy.  When I have a (to me) evening free, well there are always lots of
americans on and a pickup group isn't hard to come by; its in the "morning"
that people are scarce and having a guild is very handy.

I don't see the actual advantage of GMT versus any other specific time
frame, the important thing is that the guild officers use a single
consistant time zone that you can reference.  PMT is just as good as any
other really, I was in a guild that used this before, and I still had to
adjust for EST, just dropping three hours instead of adding five.  When I
got confused I could just ask "hey, what time is it over there anyway?"

What you really need to look for is a guild with the bulk of their players
on line at the times when -you- will be  online (or, like me, the times when
you would most like to find guildmates online).  Doing this is easier than
it might seem at first.  Look around at the guild tags on people that are
playing when you are.  Then do a /who all "guild name".  This isn't
foolproof, of course, it won't pick up anonymous or roleplay people... but
it should be pretty informative.  If most of the people in the guild are
much higher level, you are probably looking at an alt.  But it will give you
a basic count of number of people in that guild who happen to be on at the
time you are checking.  Jot down the names of likely looking guilds, and
check them again at other times and on other days to get a picture of when
their traffic flow is, if you want.

The other thing to do is to talk to people.  Group with people.  Get to know
them, and look at their guild tags as well as their names.  Find people you
like, ask them about their guilds.  Make an effort to group with other
people from the same guild (you can find them, of course, using /who all
"guild name"

Asking in a forum like this isn't a terrible idea either, but sadly we only
have about 1/1000th of the EQ population reading this.  There are something
on the order of four or five posters with characters on Morel Thule,
estimate perhaps 10 times that in people who read but never post (I read
that in a magazine somewhere, no idea how true it might be or even how you'd
find that out!)

Another idea would be to search the web for guild web sites that mention
Morel Thule.  Of course lots of guilds don't have web sites, or don't list
them in a way that you'd stumble across them this way... but it might be a
viable way to find some guilds that seem to be a good fit for you.
