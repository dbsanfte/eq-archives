Don't do it!  It probably won't solve the problem.

Many people (on the EQ Chat server) were complaining
of exactly the same problem.  It appears to be a video
driver issue.  As other have already suggested, you may
need only to install newer drivers.

Someone in EQCHat proposed editing eqclient.ini to make
VideoModeBitsPerPixel=32 - (why, I dunno, but...)

It worked for me.  (WinME, 512MB, GeForce2)  I was able
to get in and play, but various sound problems surfaced.
(no combat music, though effects remained)

I have a strong suspicion there will be more patches coming
ASAP.
