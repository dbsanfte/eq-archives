When I am put at risk by someone with melee aspirations, it's a problem. I
am forever hearing how a warrior is a damage taker and apparently may as
well be wielding stinging nettles just to aggravate the mob more (they don't
do any "REAL" damage anyway) so if I am there to get hit then a cleric is
there to keep me alive I'm not gonna feel too safe when he starts fighting
next to me...please tell where these not much healing and no cleric areas
are.

The changes made I have no problem with, I don't care what they do to other
characters, it doesn't effect me (as long as no solo'ing clerics come
running my way with a train of things they want me to help with) and likely
makes the class more attactive, you can never have too many clerics, imo. My
problem is, when someone gives out the attitude of "don't tell me what to
do" If the group wanted a melee they'd have asked for one, they wanted a
healer so don't go neglecting your tanks for your own skill ups.
