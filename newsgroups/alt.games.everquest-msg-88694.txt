There is a 1 hand pierce from a very high level dungeon (Ahkeva Ruins)
called Mind Wurm Fang.  Its 10 / 22, so makes a nice weapon, and has 5 int
on top of that.  Considering that the folks hunting there are after the
"better" drops, the fangs sell pretty cheap in comparison.  I know I've
personaly given 3 away on Terris Thule
