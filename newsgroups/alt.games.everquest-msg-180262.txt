Sorry DT, I'm not a racist, I think if you saw my wife you would know
that.
I also never said you "were" are racist, I said you made a racist
comment. 
But I see you still snipped out the rest of the post, you know the
part where you say that asians are the majority of martial artists,
when in fact whites are.Just another stereotypical comment you made
that you left out...
So , what are these asian influences in the monk guild you were
talking about....
