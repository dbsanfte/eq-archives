Who gives a crap if he broke any rules or not...this isn't a democracy.

If RedBead was an officer in the guild and he didn't like the guy's pants he 
can de-guild him.  It's his guild, his prerogative.

And while the guy technically broke no EQ rules (if it CAN be done it's not 
breaking the rules), he definitely broke the rule of "Don't be a dick."
