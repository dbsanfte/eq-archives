Here we go again.
There are 2 ways to read "Pure caster" (as someone else in this thread
has already mentioned).

Either pure caster = non melee & non hybrid (and non bard)
Or pure caster = Int Caster.

VI have used the term both ways.
Dont ask me for refs cause I can't be bothered, but last time this came
up the refs were posted.

Don't get on a high horse about this please.
From the OP it is unclear if he meant Int caster or Not
melee/hybrid/bard

Note that bards are not normally classed as Hybrid, by rather as Bards.
After all what the hell is a bard a hybrid of ?
(A pair of nike and a saxaphone ? or a Gravestone and a locamotive ?)

For clarity I wish people would use Int caster and wis caster.
That would leave pure caster to cover both.

Thread drift question :
What other hybrids would be nice to see ?
What about assasin : rogue/wizard hybrid
