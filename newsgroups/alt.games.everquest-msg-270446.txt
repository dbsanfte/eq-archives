EQ has(had) the advantage of being one of the only 2 major players in
the market for a long time. By now, a lot of people are so rooted into
EQ that it's going to take a lot to get them to simply pack up and
leave. While some people will dump an MMO at the first hiccup, there
are a lot of people who hate change enough to suffer through the rough
spots.
