I utterly failed to see this vending machine the first three times I ran 
thru the newbie island.  Comments in the newbie OOC channels indicate 
that everyone else also missed it.When you say a few basic... my level 9 
doctor still can't use half the stuff in her kit, even having pushed 
every one of the relevant skills up to the max.  Those are nice kits. 
On the other hand, there are several more nano's available in the basic 
shop that I -can- use at my level and even lower, so you aren't getting 
everything in that kit.

I love the ability to rename your pet, EQ missed a serious bet with that 
one.

I found one today, got 314 exp for opening it (better than for the 
mission or any of the mobs inside.  It had a pretty nice item inside, 
too.  And I hadn't put one point into my doctor's B&E skills, just 
bought a lockpick (which wasn't used up) and used that on the chest.

My doctor now has two tokens registered, so I'm pretty sure I was right 
there; and it seems to help to avoid the goal until after you've killed 
every mob in the place.

Oh man, I've thrown out tons of robot junk!  The bank can be filled with 
backpacks, and the backpacks with stuff, I don't see running out.  I did 
find a vendor selling stuff to go in the apartment, though, so you can 
decorate it.  Dunno if you can let anyone but yourself inside though!

My doctor upgraded her newbie pistol (and a offhand pistol) with the 
island quests, so no ammo worries at all, thus far.  My adventurer, who 
left before doing so, is using several different weapons and carrying 
lots of ammo around.

Found out the newcommer armor, with an omni or clan badge added, is not 
only really nice stuff, but upgradable every time you level.  This stuff 
is hard to beat, once you've clicked on it to upgrade it as far as you 
can, then when you level again, you click on each piece and you're up 
again.  My adventurer, wearing armor dropped from bosses on the island, 
is at about 50 or so in most categories.  My doctor, in mostly 
newcommer, is at about 160 in each category!

Sadly, the scouts on the island are for some reason terrible experience 
and hardly ever drop anything (I'd have said never, but a couple people 
said no they do, just very very rare.  I went thru over 24 scouts and 3 
of the big guy, not one drop); solo (I could take them down at level 6, 
blowing thru most of a full bar of hp and nano) they gave me 213 exp, 
with a partner, less than 100.  I eventually left in disgust, although 
I'd planned to stay till 15 just for the fun of it.  I was getting 150+ 
exp killing green droids at level 6, it seems there's some kind of 
variable as far as how much exp each mob gives.
