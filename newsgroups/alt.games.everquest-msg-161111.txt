There are two factors to consider with AA.

One, how much exp do you need to get an AA point.  This amount remains
fixed at roughly the equivalent of doing level 51.

Two, how much exp do you get per mob?  This amount varies depending on
your level relative to the level of the mob, and is modified by the "Zone
Experience Modifier"

At level 51, you find yourself getting one bub of AA exp at 100% doing the
same work you did getting one bub of real exp with the slider set to 100%
real.  Whether that means killing two red mobs or a hundred barely dark
blue mobs, its the same thing.

At level 60, you find yourself getting one AA in the time you'd spend
getting one yellow real.  Sadly, not by killing just two of those mobs
that used to be red to you, though, if they are now blue you'll still have
to kill quite a lot of them to get that AA ding.

What changes radically, though, is that at 61, the number of low dark blue
mobs drops very dramatically, the number of zones you can get effective
experience of any kind drops drammatically.  It becomes much much harder
to get AA by farming relatively easy mobs anywhere, suddenly your exp mobs
have a strong tendancy to summon or be immune to run speed changes, and to
whale the tar out of anyone going toe to toe with them.  Advantage, charm
classes, or small groups with Slow and decent tanking (maybe advantage
beastlords?)

If you see some highly useful AA skills, and are an efficient solo class,
I'd strongly consider turning AA to 100% at 60.9999, and farming like mad
till you get to your destination.  Or heck, get 61.000000001, and then
arrange for a rez every three hours, so you can be 61 any time you want.
