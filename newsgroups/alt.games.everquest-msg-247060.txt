Normally, yes. But EQ and the internet is the haven for abbreviations.

If I bumped into a Johathan in the game I'd probably refer to him as J 
if it was unambiguous, rather than spell out his name 40 times in group 
chat.

Expecting people to spell out character or avatar or cartoon when toon 
is available is not going to happen. I suppose they could go with 
char... but char is rp slang, and toon is fps slang...it depends where 
you come from.
