I hadn't heard about these until today. I went to Castersrealm for info;
but, as with alternate advancement, they don't explain it they just give the
list of abilities. With AA the only way I figured out what it was and how it
worked was by reading people here asking for advice on how to best set the
ratio and at which level (BTW, do you need to have Luclin to use it or is it
for all 51+ characters?).

So, when did these items come about? Do you need to equip them inorder to
get the benefit of the item's focus ability or does it just need to be in a
non-container inventory slot?
