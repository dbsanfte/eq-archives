This is the first time I've run into this one, so I wanted to make sure
I wasn't over-reacting.

I was in EK farming tailoring supplies in the open wooded field right by
the bridge to NK.  It was mostly empty, but there was a guy running
around PL'ing a couple of trolls.  That really didn't bother me, and I
pretty much tended to stay away from them, so I didn't worry about it
too much.

However, at one point, I saw a lion patriarch standing over by them, but
they had 2 or 3 mobs already engaged, so I ran over and killed it.  I
get a tell from him asking me not to killsteal his mobs.  I was really
confused by this.  I told him I hadn't, and he replied that he had
rooted that lion and it was for the trolls.

After a few more tells, with me pretty much saying that anything that
wasn't engaged was free for anyone, and him telling me not to kill his
rooted mobs, he stopped saying anything to me.

A couple of minutes later, I get a tell from one of my guild officers
asking me not to killsteal.  Of course, I explained the situation to
him, and told him I was staying away from them anyway, so that was the
end of that, but it's been bugging me.

So now I'm asking.  Was I being unreasonable, or was he just hoping to
chase me away from his valet parking?

Thanks for the input.
