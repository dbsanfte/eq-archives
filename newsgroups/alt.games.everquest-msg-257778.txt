More information to throw in, EQ2 specific, in EQ2 they only give you 5
concentration points, so there is much less finesse involved it would
seem.  Of interest to those who wish to be casters and priests, there are
self-only buffs for those "weaker" classes that vastly improve their
mitigation and melee skills, but which require 4 out of 5 concentration
points. Which means that any caster using these very powerful buffs in a
group would be unable to buff their party, but when they are soloing, or
when there is a surplus of healers or mages, they can whip out their inner
meleer and go to town.

I suspect that these buffs still do not make them the equal of a fighter,
but they give enough to allow them to patch in the empty spots.  It's a
smarter idea, imho, than giving priests and caster higher mitigation and
melee skills to begin with.

The assumption here, of course, is that SOE has said that all classes WILL
be able to solo up to max level, hence the need to pad the weaker folks.
What they've done for fighters and scouts for fairness sake we don't know.
Maybe they don't need anything the way the game is designed.
