Your test is flawed.

Make a dwarf warrior, and jack up stamina.  Then make a dwarf
Paladina and jack up his stamina.  Now take a look at the HP.

For some reason, you set up a straw man arguement; taking races
with highest stamina and adding more, and comparing to a race
with low stamina and adding nothing.  Comparing apples to
oranges at that point.

Given identicle race and stamina, warriors start at the same
HP, but as you level up, warriors will gain more HP than
members of other classes.  More per level, and more per
point of stamina.

At low levels, where the divergence is relatively little,
this doesn't matter all that much.  Once clerics get
Complete Heal, though, total HP starts to be more
interesting than simply measuring how long you can
endure a fight before dropping.  Since CHeal costs
the same mana regardless of how much damage it
repairs, and always repairs you to full, it is most
cost effective on those with the most HP.

Even then, it doesn't matter all that much, CHeal
doesn't really come into its own until you are
using it on post 50 tanks, where the HP totals
start to get really really huge.  Interestingly, it
is at this point that the divergence between
the classes really starts to become noticable.

So, if you really want to examine this question,
try finding two identicle level, same race characters,
one a warrior, one an SK or Paladin, and getting
them to juggle around their gear till they have the
same STA (and +hp gear, if any) up in the post
50 range.  Now tell me what their HP are.

We could go the other route, of course, take an
Iksar Necromancer, level 60, with sta gear
raising him up to 200. Ask him his HP.  Now
compare to the hp of a level one dark elf warrior
with his default 70 STA.  Wow, Necromancers
have more hp than warriors!  See the flaw in your
thinking?
