Maybe you do things different but every newsreader i have ever used threads
messages from oldest to newest, so my hindsight as you put refered to messages
posted prior not post the one you so took offense to.  

I do agree with you that flame wars end up with tripe not bacon.

Her emoticon line as I read it, and yes I am going by what I have seen her post
before that, and yes i know full well that posts get missed, delayed etc., was
that she was making reference to the fact that in this newsgroup, in interviews,
speaches by government officials etc, that this tragedy is somehow more
important because it happened here in america.  Yes the scale is much larger
that anything proceeding it, it is a tragedy, nobody deserved it etc.  

I am not going to say anymore about this because frankly i am sick of the whole
thing degenerating into flame wars everywhere, i am not trying to flame you, I
am just trying to defend someone who I felt was being maligned by the tone of
your post, and possibly make you notice that you were maligning her.  Since you
wont admit you might possibly be wrong in your assesment, and have to stoop to
bitching about her emoticon use to "prove" you're right, it's obvious there is
no way to change your opinion on this subject.
