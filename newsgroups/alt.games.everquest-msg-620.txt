You will almost certainly be borderline KoS at the very best, although
East and West Freeport are considered to be a tad "corrupt", so with
faction you should be able to pass thru here unmolested.

For the time being, avoid actually entering the city. That doesnt mean
you can't bind there. Outside the city gates, and the area all around
it, is within the zone and is a bindable area. Just zone into East
Freeport from North Ro and /shout until some kind soul binds you (if
you are still unable to bind yourself at level 10).
