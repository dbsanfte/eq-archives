Interesting.  Solo XP for my lazy lowbie Ranger isn't any slower
there (vs. time) than in "normal" zones.  So I'd say that either
that 60 is incorrect or those mobs are even easier than they seem.
Come to think of it, it hasn't been all that long since I was in
a group at the Sarnak fort there and the XP was quite decent (vs.
time, again) for the effort required.  Much slower than PC (for
appropriate levels), but since I tend to maintain all my weapon
skills at or near max PC does nothing for me, have to go through
the tedium of working up lagging skills later (some of us lack
200k budgets and L65 Shaman PLers for our alts).
