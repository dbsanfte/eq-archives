But often a superior plan would be to lull C, then charm B, which will 
pull A, sic B on A once he's in the room with you.  D and E don't add in 
because they are too far from A or B to add, unless C is unlulled so he 
comes along, then since D and E are close enough to C, they add in too.

Without the charm part, lulling B to get just A is the plan.

This isn't always possible of course, but generally there's a mob or two 
you can lull in a room which function this same way, eliminating 
potential chain adds even though you don't lull them as well.

Splendid
