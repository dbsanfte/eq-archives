Forget about it. I lost the swimming Ogre and got lost in the water trying
to find ABe and his buddies. I had a tracker with me and after 20 minutes of
cussing and freaking, the Druid tells me he has found the spirit. Approached
the Spirit and finished the part of the quest. Got my Shammy boots and never
even saw the arrow. So unless it is needed after the boots part - just
destroy it.
