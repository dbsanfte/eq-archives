wow, I found new online golf game, Shot-Online!!
 I really love playing golf, but there's no enough time to go to
field..
 so I tried to find some nice golf game and finally! I got it!! kiki:)
 
 well, this golf game with an internet access is great.. and it's
quite interesting. Think of it as a cross between EQ and Tiger Woods
Championship Golf 2005. That's the best description.I think..
 it's kinda fun and in beta already. Graphics are decent, the courses
are solid and it's like making my own pro golfer! (for your reference,
they have 7 courses..) If you're enjoyng golf in any form.. I bet
you'll like it. You can play it at "http://www.shot-online.com"

Maybe some of you think that golf is a boring sport.
But if you play this game once, it'll be changed. most of my friends
didn't have any interest in golf, but after joining this game, they
became golf enthusiasts!! kiki :) 

 Actually, I need more people who can enjoy the rounding with me at
the Shot-Online.. anybody who wants to join it? i want to make some
friends through this game.. My id in Shot online is Jinny. after joining here,
register me as a friend! See ya at Shot online :)
