Why thank you.  And, no, I have never begged for anything.  I've been given
a few things.  I do sometimes ask for a buff politely.  To be honest though,
for a druid with Camo, it really wasn't difficult at all.  I did leave
everything I owned in the bank before setting out though, didn't think I'd
be fighting anything anyway, or if I was, it wouldn't matter if I fought
back or not.
