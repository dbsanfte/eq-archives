Its every wizard spire evidently. Something a verant person said long
ago in a preview was "you will be no more than 3 zones at most from
luclin in any part of the world." That kind of figures that it would
be pretty much EVERY wizard spire or teleport thingie then. In kunark
you could be a bit more than 3 sometimes though and I guess in velious
also.

Something else they said confused me though. It was something about
then being able to return where you came from instantly (like with a
firepot?) If that was the case though, if you knew the time table for
spire pick ups this would really be a great way to get around the
world because you could nop on a spire to the nexus then take a
"firepot" or whatever to north karana or somewhere you wanted to go.
For some reason I'm thinking it won't quite work like that.
