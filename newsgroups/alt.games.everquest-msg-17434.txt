I have a AMD K6-2 running at 400mhz with 265 meg ram. The board has built in
everything, so to the manufacturer, no reason to add agp slots. (Damn PC
Chips) The models is a M586, no idea how old it is, got it about 2 weeks
agao. All I know is that the 3d system on it SUCKS! Keep some answers
coming. I have access to a Voodoo card for about 100 on ebay, but I would
like to get something with a store warrenty maybe... If anyone knows of any
way to get the Luclin running with a PCI video card LMK. Also, can you give
me some ideas of what else to upgrade? Like CPU speed? This board will
support up to a 500 i think. My old board with AGP slots can to 333 at most
i think. If anyone can get me a board with AGP slots that will support a
higher CPU speed, please post here. =) I think thats about it for now...
keep that info flowing!

Thank you everyone,
