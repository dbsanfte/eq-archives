Well, me for one.  Teach me to read the *entire* patch message instead of
just skimming it quickly.

Wondered why that wolf in Dawnshroud was wailing away on me and all I
was getting was an occasional bash.

A better one is this (*&$%(*& Microsoft keyboard.  Two *big* annoyances:

1.  Function keys by default aren't function keys.  One must hit "Func
Lock".
2.  There's no insert key.  You must use Ctrl-V to paste.  Hard to use the
different viewpoints in EQ.

Oh well, enough pissin' and moanin'
