Yup, magician research sucks the big one as it is...doing the practice runes
only makes it less pleasant.  There are lots of spells that you can EITHER
buy or research.   Get your research skill up on the ones you can buy...or
keep popping your practice points into it (that's what I did).  It gets
expensive but I think it's worth it.
