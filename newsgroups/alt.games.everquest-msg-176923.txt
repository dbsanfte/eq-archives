I go through the normal updates and now when I get to the screen where
your character is shown just befor launching the screen goes to a very
small box in the upper left hand corner and there is no cursor on the
screen. I cannot enlarge the window as I dont have a cursor and it
indicates that there is no enlargement available regardless.

Previously a cursor arrow was frozen in the middle of the everquest
screen and did not go away (But I soulc play the game) and now the this
problem has developed.

I wonder if it has something to do with me purchasing the upcoming
expansion and the files I downloaded?

If I uninstall everquest and reload will I lose anything or are all my
atrributes saved on the SOE servers? Don't want to risk losing my lvl
31 ranger.

Thank for your assistance
