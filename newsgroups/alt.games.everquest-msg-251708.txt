Greetings :-)

I was toying with the idea of using the buddy key and growing a Shaman to
partner my 54 Iksar Monk.

I'd like to level him up fairly quickly, so was considering the "beat the
mob with the monk until it's almost dead and FD" route. Probably on undead,
as it doesn't work if the mob is running.

I could also use a DS potion on the monk, and pull a pile of mobs, then pick
them off one by one with the shaman when they are low enough. Problem with
this is some of the mobs may have beaten themselves to death before getting
a chance to hit them. Maybe pull them one at a time with the shaman and put
the Monk in the way. Not sure how the monk could get aggro without out
damaging the shaman - maybe disarm?

I've also got a 30 (maybe 31) Iksar Beastlord on the same account as the
monk I'd be looking at getting the shaman up to a grouping level with him
first, and then levelling the pair of them up to the monk The shaman will
only need to be 18 or so to group with the BL, so should I just solo him up
to 20 in Kurns/Paludal? Or maybe just stick with the monk/shaman combo, get
the shaman to the monk's level and then PL the beastlord?

I may also consider a druid instead of the shaman, which I think will
complement the beastlord better. Got a feeling the BL will become my main,
as the monk has ground to a halt recently.

I could always just pay the ï¿½27 and get the beastlord transferred to the
buddy account :-)

Any thoughts on powerlevelling a char using a 54 monk or 30 beastlord then?
