I wonder why at all they messed around with the CoGP,surely they
are more important things to fix,another example that all that 
announcements about "listening to the players" are just announcements.
Didnt they foresee that this would annoy players?

This reminds me,didnt they say the old UI will be continued to be
supported? - Now I get a message when logging in my UI is no
longer supported,and I am missing a (new) tab in the guild tool
window.

lies,lies,lies.
