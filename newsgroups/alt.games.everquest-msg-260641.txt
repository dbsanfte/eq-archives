My pet is the first thing I send in when the MT has engaged a mob.
My assist key is set up to target the mob, then I use the pet attack to set
my pet on the mob.
If I have any problems pet backoff is good as well as guard.
I have found the majority of the time the pet runs off it is in the caves or
somewhere where the pathing is a bit dodgy.

If in doubt, pet goaway may not be a bad thing......
