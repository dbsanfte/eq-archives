Just to let you know dual wield goes up very quickly on it's own.  At least
it did for me as a rogue.  I first got dual wield at lvl13 and at 19 I am
already a master at 115 skill points.  It is my highest skill.

I don't know about blacksmithing, but I am following the answers you get
because I have another char that I am making into a smith.
