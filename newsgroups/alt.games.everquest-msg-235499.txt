Based on the perceptions I had *after* the system went *live*. Don't
confuse the issue with beta pre-conceptions. I had none.

 I did not participate in the beta, and in fact did not purchase the
box until after it was reported that tribute by items was quite viable
and worthwhile over using straight plat.... but before the rampant
exploits were discovered.

So was PoP, but anyone who tries to tell you the PoK wasn't a must
have carrot that *everybody* benefitted greatly from is just lying to
themselves.. With LoY it was maps+banks, etc... similiarly GoD tribute
was apparently the carrot for everybody.... since the system opens up
at the whopping level of 10.

That I'm not regularly playing 60+ chars is just a temporary thing,
but even once I do get there I'm still not sure my plat income will be
sufficient for what I would want, what I was led to beleive was more
than achievable -- based on the live implementation.
