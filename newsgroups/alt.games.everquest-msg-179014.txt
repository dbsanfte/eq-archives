Oh, I agree. I never meant "seconds", but if you could make the base 
mana regen rate closer to KEI when off a hate list, it would cut down on 
downtime significantly without trivializing encounters. Same with melee... 
Their sitting regeneration could be increased to something equivalent to 
wearing a Fungi Tunic when off a hate list. This would give some melees 
the chance to solo at least a little.
