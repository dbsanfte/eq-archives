You have to want it to do it.  More particularly, want it enough.

What makes you think that one upgrade per month, which is far more than I've
gotten for long stretches of time raiding, is "faster"?  More interesting,
without a doubt.  More enjoyable, again no question.  Faster?  Doubt it. 
Let's face it, I can farm, with any level of equipment right down to being
naked, enough cash to get a full outfit of DoN gear in a couple months.  Try
and take a naked level 70 monk and get anywhere close to a similar level of
gear in that same time period raiding.

Well, everyone knows it was a mistake, but not for any of the reasons you
mentioned.  =)

There is no such thing as "charm-cheating".  I'm sorry you don't like doing
what it takes to beat an encounter.  I guess you won't be happy unless it
can be beat by CH-cheating.   =P

Available.  Once you have access to KT, you have access to Ikkinz and Yxxta. 
Whether you take advantage of that is entirely up to you.

You weren't back then either...  by comparably equipped monks.

Which shows that the raiders have to put up with fickle clerics (and others)
as well.   =)

I'm talking about what it looks like after you (intelligently) fill up the
aug slots.  You get a *lot* of aug slots going with DoN vendor-bought gear,
more than I have, which definitely narrows the gap in equipment when you use
them to put ~70 hp, and some ac, resists, or effects, *per* piece.  That's
just the augments, on top of the already decent stats on the equipment
itself.
