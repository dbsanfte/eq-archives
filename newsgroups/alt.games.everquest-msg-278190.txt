After verifying that this is true I'm thoroughly not impressed.

Seeing as the OP left no cite:

"Why was the subscription rate increased?

Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, we 
will be increasing our subscription rates in June. While this 
announcement may be unpleasant, the cost of operating a top tier MMO has 
increased significantly over the past three years and this change will 
help us achieve our goal of seeing that every player has a consistently 
enjoyable experience in the world of EverQuest."

EQ1 to cost as much as EQ2? Part of their strategy to bump us over to 
eq2? Part of their strategy to make sure we all give WoW another look, 
now that its the same price?

My only comment to SOE now is:

Prove it!!

How on earth can a game whose primary development is surely paid off, 
whose continued development is supported by regular expansions, in an 
era of falling hardware and bandwidth prices require another 15% jack to 
the rates to continue to support?

Come on SOE, lets see just how badly you've mismanaged your finances. 
This game makes 5.5 million per month. In a few weeks you'll be running 
half as many servers as you were a couple months ago.

You've recently *reduced* your customer service costs (remember how 
proud you were about that) you even told us all about it.

MMOGs benefit greatly from economies of scale. EQ has more than twice 
the subscriber base as EQ2... i hate to see whats in store for them.

If it truly costs you more to run EQ now than it did 2 years ago you 
need to fire your obviously incompetent management team.

So where exactly did you blow it? 

Lets see the balance sheet. -What- exactly went up so much in face of so 
much that we KNOW went down?

Why not just come clean and tell us that you'd like to make more money 
while providing the same level of service? Isn't that the truth? We'd 
probably even have more respect for you if you told us that then this 
fantasy about "increased costs".
