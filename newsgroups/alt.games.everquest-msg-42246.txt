Faction is a funny thing.  Your starting faction with each mob out there is
determined
by your race, religion, and class.  Agnostic isn't something many mobs object to,
nor is warrior.  I'd expect dark elves to take a dim view of humans in general...
the
chart on the (not very good) Prima guide book suggests that humans have tension
with them.  Perhaps, though, without objectionable class or religion that tension
merely
puts you at Dubious.

Many low level characters spend some time in Greater Faydark or Crushbone, killing
orcs, which gives hits against one of the dark elf factions.  Perhaps you've never
done
anything to actively annoy them, and just happen not to quite be hated yet.

Then again, perhaps you've been doing something evil, like hunting the halflings
in
Nektulous, which has raised the faction that the dragoon is on.  Without a lot
more
knowledge about what you've been doing, and where you were (which dragoon was it?
Which zone?) its really hard to say for sure.

Hmm, another possibility is that you are so high level that the dragoon is afraid
to come near you.  Another is that you were invisible, that makes mobs that can't
see invisible
con indifferent to you.
