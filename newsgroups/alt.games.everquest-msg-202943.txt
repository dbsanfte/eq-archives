<<<<<Is Clarity or Clarity II not good enough?  I don't think there are
level restrictions to Clarity II.  If you can find a bard around your
level he/she should be able to crank out just about as much mana
regeneration as KEI if he/she sings the correct songs.>>>>

Be honest with you, it's been so long since I've had a simple clarity that I
don't remember how it is.  I do think that I thought it was too slow.  Better
watch out though, there's a couple of idiots on this board that would like it
better if they did away with the clarity line of spells altogether.  They want
everyone who is lower level than them to have to med for 3 days in between
fights.
