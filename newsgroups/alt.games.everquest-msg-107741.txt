Wrong and wrong.  

While sending a blank petition can generate the "illegal data" message a
corrupted petition will display the same.  This has happened to me and
via discussion between CSR and player verified to be true.  So we can
clearly see that you were wrong on the first point.

A canned  response does not indicate the guide did not read it except to
those such as yourself who would assume that they are always right.  I
can think of a number of reasons as to why a simple greeting before
business would be in order none of which would be negated by reading the
petition first.  So again you are wrong.

Must suck to be you Ben, so important to be right and yet you so rarely
are.
