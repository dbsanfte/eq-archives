Hehe, and then theres the really moronic crowd:

Moron01: Can i get a port to BB, plz?
Me: Sorry, busy at the momebt.
Moro1: Ill pay.
Me: I said busy, not greedy.

Really hate those morons that freely show that dont respect that im 
busy, AND appearantly think they should get ports/buffs/whatever for 
free. Usually charges for ports, but dont take money for buffs, if 
people are nearby, and ask politely.
But if someone dont respect me, its their own problem, then i cant be 
bothered to help them.
