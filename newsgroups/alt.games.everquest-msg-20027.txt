I'm older than you, and I agree with John that the post came across as a
bit whiny, especially considered that --as you yourself admitted-- you
have only played for a week and have a lot to learn.

Anyway, I think you deserve at least a warning: EverQuest is
****HARD****. If you want an easy multiplayer game, try Asheron's Call.
If you decide to stick with EQ, I can guarantee you that by the time you
are, say, level 15-20, you won't have a lot of time for level fours who
can't shrug off losing a corpse.
