Take barge from Oasis to Timourous Deep.  Swim to the Firepots.
Take the Cabalis Firepot.  Get a bind.  Zone.  You are in Lake of
Ill Omen, no muss, no fuss, 15 minutes to a half hour
time elapsed, depending on time spent waiting for the barge.

Oh, don't try this if you aren't a monk or invis capable caster,
you'll have to use FD repeatedly to get out past those guards,
and although anyone with SOW or an invis potion can pull that
off, being bound there means you need to be able to deal with that
situation regularly while naked.

You may want to run down to Firiona Vie and get a bind there
instead, although crossing spider country isn't really any safer
in my opinion, and it puts you further from your hunting grounds.
