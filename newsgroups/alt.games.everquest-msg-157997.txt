They appear to have changed it such that it seems to use the Windows default
MIDI device (before, it was usually the Microsoft sound system, or other
things.)

Basically, if you can play a .mid file using the normal applications (Media
Player et-al, NOT something dedicated, but something that uses the normal
Windows API for playing the MIDI music), you _ought_ to be able to hear the
music now I believe.  Worth checking with a .mid file & Windows Media Player
to make sure it works for you.
