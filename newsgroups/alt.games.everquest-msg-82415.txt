It's quite hard to get all resists to 100 AND keep wisdom at 200. I'd
suggest buying all the resist gear you can find, and not worry about
your wisdom when they're worn. Your mana won't do you any good if you're
dead after 2 AOEs. 

I'd also trade Dark Ember to a Paw of Opolla. You're not going to melee 
at your level, and the paw would give you 9 WIS and 10(?) AC.

Charisma gear is pretty cheap. You can get a good 20-30 points increase
for a couple of hundred PP. You're not a dwarf, so you don't need to 
invest in it too heavily.
