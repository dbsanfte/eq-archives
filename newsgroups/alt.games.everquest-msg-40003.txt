I would add run the Stein of Moggok, sell it for 200pp, run it again, sell it,
again, again and again.  Take part in the economy of the server, farm the quest
to purchase better +Int and +Cha, the equipment that Bryan suggests.  Also use
your booty to purchase 20-40 lots of gems and silver/ electrum bars to get your
jewelry skill up.  Being a jeweler is expensive, take advantage of the quests
at hand to take part of the server economy.

Regards,
John
