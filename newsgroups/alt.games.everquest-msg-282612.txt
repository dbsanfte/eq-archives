Excellent points, all. You are correct, I'm thinking more of an event
than a raid. I referred to it as a "raid" since it would have involved
several full groups acting as one larger organized group.

My goal would be to clear out Rivervale. Perhaps what I should do
instead is post to the official, appropriate EQ forums. This may be
more involved than I was prepared to deal with. But dangit, I want some
serious halfling carnage!
