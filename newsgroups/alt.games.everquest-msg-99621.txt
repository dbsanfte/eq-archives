Actually, running the route from Shadow Haven -> Echo Caverns ->
Fungus Grove -> Twilight Sea -> Katta Castellum would be
safer, even though they're technically higher-level zones
than the ones you list.

Echo Caverns is a piece of cake with the invisibility song (just
avoid the waving tentacle plants, they work by touch, but do
not wander).

Fungus Grove will have 45+ mobs, but most will non-KoS unless
you've spent a lot time killing them, and the few which are
KoS are static (do not wander) and are easily walked around.

On the other hand, Tenebrous can be a nightmare of wandering
mobs that see through invis, and in Grimling forest it's
easy to trip over things, the visibility it bad.
