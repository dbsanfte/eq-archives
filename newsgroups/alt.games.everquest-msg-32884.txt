The dwarf can spawn at any of the trap locations that spawn the Kromiff Death
Squad.  Only one trap trigger will be up at any time, in the possible
locations for it.  The locations are almost all in a semi-circle around the
Kael ramp entrance.   Each trap spawn has a small chance to be the dwarf
instead of the KDS.  (decided at the time the trap spawns).

The spoiler for help on this quest is to charm a pet (or ask a friend to bring
one) and tell it to guard at the entrance to the Kael ramp.  The pet will turn
and face the nearest mob (an untriggered trap does count as a mob). Then you
run exactly in the direction the pet is facing.   If it's the KDS, train them
to Kael and try again.  If it's the dwarf, hand him your velium vapors and get
out of there.

Theres also a small trick for telling whether the trap is the KDS or the
Dwarf.  If you try to hand an item to the trap, (drop it on the ground while
allow dropping is off) you will see the beginning of the message the trap
springing gives in the trade window.   The dwarf has a different beginning
from the KDS.  Something like "You stumble across a..." instead of "You are
suprised by..."  .  (I only got this one to work once... it was a real pain in
the ass to find the exact spot where it was sitting to hand it to it.)


The dwarf is a somewhat rarish spawn.   I think we trained in about 20 - 25
death squads, only getting 2 dwarves.  (The first one we weren't able to turn
it in, since 2 members of the previous death squad were still up and aggro on
us.  Druid ended up dying trying to hand it over.)
