Guild groups excepted;
On No-drop items yes thats obvious, but on the dropable stuff its
gotta be open rolls. The reason being Ive seen little if any caster
items drop in LDoN, a butt load of melee items though. I know they
sell this stuff at some point so why even pretend NBG on these. Gets
old seeing monk_01 walk with a dropable mace_of_agrivation and it hit
the bazaar with an hour. NBG my ass.....
