I know this has been brought up here before.  I hate to bring it up again,
but I've searched Google without success ... so here goes.

Is there a way (similar to /doability) to cast using a text macro?  My group
likes it when I announce who's getting the next heal when we're in a fight,
and clicking a text macro then clicking the spell is a pain.  Any clues
would be appreciated.

Thanks!
Crash
