<snip well focused rant about Tweety>

I thought her original rant was *hilarious* and I could see her point of view
to an extent.  (Furp.  I love that part.)  But she deserved what she got,
knowingly publishing what Verant had *specifically* said not to publish.  Way
to go, brainiac.  I can't believe someone would put her in a PR position after
all that.  This doesn't speak well for Mythic, IMHO, as it probably means
they'll be taking backhanded swipes at EQ every chance they get.  The only
reason I can think of that would make them do this is that they think it's a
clever way to insult EQ.  *shrug*

Yes, every customer service person in history has bitched about idiot
customers.  But you don't go and hire someone who has tried to make a living
out of bitching about idiot customers.  Yikes.
