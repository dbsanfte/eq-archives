So? Maybe kids are going back to school.. vacations... sick?? Who 
knows.. certainly not YOU.

Hmm maybe people finally woke up and realized that the $2000 they spent 
on the account that just got banned by VI is a huge waste of money? So 
how much are YOU selling for?

> Of the 117 people in my guild less than 50 now play regularly .
See above. Or is your guild a "farmers" guild. Have you asked them why? 
Maybe it's because of the reasons stated above? Oh btw you'd better 
watch it.. the "Uber" committee might come by and revoke your 
"uberness".

Again, could you cite some references? You know this how?? Oh I get it 
you're the official "uber guildleader psychoanalyst". Yeah right. And so 
what if they do? Somehow I don't think the "power vacuum" is as bad as 
you make it out to be.
