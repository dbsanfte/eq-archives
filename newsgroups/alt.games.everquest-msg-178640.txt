Your "with ease" is missing the qualifier "at substantial expense".

Wrong.  Reduced margins *always* reduce profits unless the market
(or market share) expands to cover the difference as a result of
the reduced margins.  You have presented no evidence to suggest
that this market expansion would occur.

There is a huge difference between the relatively loose oversight that
accompanies high profit levels and the detailed auditing and micro-
management that follows shrinking profits as night follows day in most
organizations I've observed.

Um, this one nearly rendered me speechless.  You're talking about
hundreds (if not thousands) of machines and all the physical and
human support required to house, operate, and maintain them.  I'm
betting that running the server farm is the biggest expense SOE has
with EQ.
