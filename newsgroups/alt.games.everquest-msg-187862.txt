Actually, Cleric's have no obligation in a group. No obligation to
heal, no obligation to rez. Nothing.

Likewise, Enchanters are not obliged to mez. Tanks are not obliged to
taunt - or even fight for that matter. Shaman are not obliged to buff
/ debuff / whatever.

There is no obligation placed upon any class to do much of anything.

Someone show me in any of SOE's documentation where these obligations
are printed. Someone inform me of the mechinism by which the game
FORCES any character to perform any of these actions.

On the other hand, try getting in a group if you don't do these
things. Next time you play your Enchanter be sure to tell your group:
"BTW, I won't be mezzing any adds." Have your Warrior say "I'm not
gonna fight anything. I'll just sit here in the corner." Likewise,
when you join the group as a Cleric, be sure to say "I won't be doing
any rezzes if someone dies." Let's see how long you stay in the group.
Try telling your guild the same thing.

Certain behaviours are definitely expected of certain classes, but in
no way obliged. But if you're a Cleric who doesn't rez fallen group
members (for just about any reason*) and I know it, you won't be in my
group. Just like the Enchanter who doesn't mez or the tank who doesn't
fight.

*Off the top of my head, I can come up with two reasons not to rez a
fallen group member: Their corpse is for some reason not retrievable
or you are not able to contact the person (LD, not responding to
/tells, etc.).
