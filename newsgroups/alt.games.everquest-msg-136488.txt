I think you're mangling fact with fiction again.  TV and other
broadcast entertainment is not mentioned in any way in the Charter!
LOL

There's a bit of a tempest in a teapot right now over Canadians
subscribing to satellitle TV from US companies.  These services are
controlled in Canada by the CRTC, and in the US by the FTC.

Sounds like your idiocy in progress.  Interesting that you find me so
fascinating that you feel the need to comment on my every message.
Not that you'll be willing to understand the difference, but for those
with reading comprehension who may be lurking:
(1) it is my understanding that many legal/political experts feel
Section 33 can not be used in the way Alberta has threatened to do,
(2) my reading of the Charter does not convince me that they can not,
but clearly shows a 5 year limit to any use of the notwithstanding
clause (renewable)
(3) I have never made such a simplistic statement as "can" or "can
not"
(4) I did not say it using Section 33 in this case would be at the
"expense" of other rights.  I said that the precedent would weaken
other rights

I know, all these big words confuse you.

My position was to state my GUESS as to the motive.

Really are obsessed, aren't you?  LOL.  The order of events is
different, there is no comparison.  Besides, I though you beleived PBS
had *planned* to bring the character to the US, are you now changing
your position to say that they only "seriously considered" it?

Having failed to prove your point about "special rights", do you
really expect to get very far with "extra rights" now?  That's EQ,
always good for a laugh.
