Im at over 1400ac, pretty much ever monk in my guild is, and nobody wears a
fungi.

Maybe we just all suck and don't understand our classes?   And it is a
choice thing..  Id say 99% of us has a fungi in their inventory.. we just
don't wear it day-to-day

I personally never see anybody "high end" that wears a fungi... in my guild
or any other.
