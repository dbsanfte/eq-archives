 Yeah, back when Necklace of Superiority still dropped there. I remember
camping lump goo for my fighting baton, setting up as many non-aggro
nibblers as I could. I think they nerfed that though and now there's no
such thing as non-aggro nibblers. Plus with the caster changes leading
to chain-casting mobs... I'm not so sure a Monk of the appropriate level
could still do this camp solo anymore. Which is sad.
