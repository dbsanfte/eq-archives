Need your help guys and gals...

My magician killed a rat near the East Freeport gate. The only loot on it
was a Tiny Magic Glowing Skull. It is a magic item. It is NOT lore. No I
have not had someone use an identify spell on it yet. I have looked on every
web site I can find for information on this drop. The only things similar
are in high level areas not the Freeport newbie zone where this came from.
Also, no one could have planted the item on the rat, it spawned right in
front of me. This is slowly driving me crazy. I have had offers as high as
100 plat for it and I ain't a sellin' 'till I knows what it is. Can anyone
let me know or at least offer ideas that I haven't thought of? Class is
all/all and it is not an equipable item. It has no stats of any kind. I
think the weight is like 0.1 . I know of no others in existence and even a
guide I asked once knew nothing of it. With my luck it is part of a quest
they shut down but I am keeping up hope. Help please.
