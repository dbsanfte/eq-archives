Let me add one that really gets me, seeing:

Warriormcbadazz (or a similarly bad name) Shouts "Naked newbie, just lost
all of my stuff, looking for any extra gear you have.  PLZ!"
My problems with that are:

1) Stop begging.  I am more likely to help someone who asks nicely.
Although most of my "useless" gear goes to a newbie I see while running
around.

2) If you REALLY feel the NEED to beg, dont SHOUTIT, do it in OOC.  IF you
NEED to shout it, then at least role-play it (i.e): Good people of
"zonename", I have recently lost all my belongings due to a raid by those
ruthless bandits in the Karanas.  If you have any spare coin, items or
food, it would help me and my family greatly."
