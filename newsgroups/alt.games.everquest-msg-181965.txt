    We are a FCFS server. However, my guild prides itself on not being like
the assholes on other servers that use FCFS to justify all sorts of blocking
to defend their content lead. That's why we did a rotation on Emperor, not
because we couldn't keep him permanently dead if we wanted, but to make it
so the three guilds after him didn't have to waste time camping the zone in
Ssra waiting for people to log on. Our East coast players didn't want to
spend their gaming time like that, and I doubt the other two guilds wanted
to do the same. As I've said before, rotations are really in the best
interests of all parties in EQ if they're set up logically. Although you've
flamed me for that, too. "Only three guilds in your little 'rotation', huh?
ELITIST EXCLUSIONIST BASTARD!"

    Well, that's what we'll be doing from now on. Breaking the agreement did
not earn them any friends, and lost them quite a few.

    Sigh, this was the agreement. The other two guilds **agreed to this
condition**, because without it we'd have said "F it" and killed Rallos and
left them holding their members.

    Their position is that our guildleader had told them that we were going
to kill Rallos and break the agreement, so they were not bound by it. Not
only have they failed to post any logs to back this up (our guildleader
posted logs to show the agreement before this whole mess even happened), but
we were in Halls of Honor from before they entered PoTactics until after
they won. Does it sound to you like we were rushing RZ? If you search that
server message board, you can find another long flame thread that basically
started when I called the leaders of one of the guilds two-faced liars. That
was months before this happened, based on our previous dealings with them. I
wish I hadn't been right, and I wish some of their members - the good people
stuck with bad leadership - would see this and try and change things on
their end.

    Well, the agreement said they wouldn't band together to kill him, and
they did. So yeah, I'm a little ticked about it.

    STOP TRYING TO READ INTO THINGS. These people could try and be the first
across all servers to kill Corinav. Or first in Time. Instead, they're
farming bows for phat plats. As someone who strives for achievement, this
offends me. My opinion may not mean crap to them or anyone else, but I still
have the right to have one.

    Deal! The guildleader of one of the guilds should have his account
banned. Oh, actually BOTH guildleaders should be banned, as the de facto
leader of the second guild was the E-Bay'ed account I talked about
petitioning. (The actual leader of the second guild is still level 62, as he
only plays to raid and to PL whatever "girl" he's cybering at the moment.)

    The two guilds couldn't bring each other along, and only during the
"three day" period AFAIK. Their position since this event has been "who are
you to try and stop us from having fun and teaming up?" We've tried to point
out to their members that might not have realized it that their own leaders
agreed not to do this very thing, and went back on their word. I'm not sure
many of them care now that they can get phatter lewts. =(

    Normally, we have no say in who goes where and don't try to interfere.
But these two guilds wanted something from us - for us to stay away and let
them beat the encounter, an encounter we wanted to do as well. We made
concessions from our initial position, so did they. Neither side was really
happy about it, a sure sign it was a good deal for both. They broke that
deal.

    November, 2001. I was part of the guild's first AoW kill and first
Tunare kill, but wasn't part of the guild when they broke into NToV or when
they did the bulk of their Sleeper's farming.

    So have you been in any ONE guild for 15 months, or are you a
lootwhoring guildhopper?

    Did that question seem fair? It was about as fair as you suggesting that
I hadn't been in my guild very long.

> was guilded and fighting bigger shit than you could in pick up groups
> long beforehand.

    You may have fought bigger mobs than I could in a mere pick-up group,
but don't forget that I had been guilded previous to Lotus Cult and had done
some raid targets (Hate inc. Inny, Kael arena, Aaryonar) - raid targets
bigger than those you'd killed. My experiences with those previous guilds
were what had left me with such a bad taste for being guilded in the first
place.

    Although you have no idea when they took place!

    Actually, it was your overblown accusations that I couldn't become
guilded because I clearly wasn't a team player that made me decide to become
guilded again. Part of that was the "if you wouldn't let me berserk, clearly
nobody likes you" thread.

    Well, if you want to be specific there was no "tier one" because
Stormhammer, the server that introduced the concept of tiers, didn't yet
exist. We also wouldn't have been considered top tier because we hadn't
killed the top tier of mobs at the time, AoW and Tunare. But like you said,
that's semantics.

    Oh. My. God. Cut into our action? We don't farm this shit, Jazz! We
actually try to beat the toughest encounters in the planes and not whore
ourselves for uber droppable bows. How many times do I need to repeat this
before it sinks through that thick skull of yours? And as long as they're
farming this crap to fatten the old Paypal account, we can't move past
PoEarth to the tough stuff because it BLOWS ALL THE DAMNED RING EVENTS.

    Because there was a specific rotation agreement between my guild and
theirs, and they broke it when they teamed up. They lied to us, they lied to
their guild members. I'm personally upset that a guild would take a chance
like they have now and piss all over it to try and fatten the old wallet,
but that's not why I think they shouldn't be there. That just gets me angry.

> All I hear so far

    Perhaps you should read, then. I've said it so many times I think some
of Bizbee's stalkers even know the point.
