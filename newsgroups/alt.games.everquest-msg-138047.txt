I have Geforce 2 TI 64 meg. 
  What if any advantage would I notice if I went to 
say Geforce 3 500 TI or a Geforce 4 4200 ?
   Is there any  real clear/simple test to see if your Graphics card
and/or processor are slowing EQ down in any way?

   What is your experience.  Have you seen any authoritive answers
from Verant?
What about "Plains of Power" will it be more demanding of the system?

   Also I had heard  Verant/Sony were going to Optimize EQ for the
Pentium 4 anything come of that?
