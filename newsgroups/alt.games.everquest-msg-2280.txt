Allakazams doesnt list either of these.  I'd bet the scalps get turned
in to someone but damned if I can figure out who....  I have a dozen
of em from helping a friend of mine get some rygor armor and need to
clear space, but was hoping there would be a nice bonus of faction or
minor exp for turning them in.

The bottle of acid I found at the entry to Crystal Caverns, no clue
what it is for.
