I got killed doing it as well, but it was somewhat special circumstances.

My rogue didn't have SoW and was running along the top of the north wall.
Wasn't sneaking, since I was only level 25, and it's a huge zone to cross at
half walking speed.   Got about halfway to Rivervale when I saw a wizard
running towards me from the other direction.  A second later I saw the four
undead that were chasing him.   Apparently he saw me to, since he changed
courses slightly to make a beeline for me.  Ran right up until he was two
steps past me, then stopped and gated.
