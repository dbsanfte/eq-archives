It was . It took them like 3 years to fix :p And some days I miss my little
halfling but it became an unsupportable character once there where druids
all over the place.

In case your curious my main is a 65 chanter with entirely too many aas.

I also do have a
65 monk
63 druid (poor little abandoned halfling)
57 wizard
56 cleric
54 rogue

Im not even a no life person like most who have so many high level
characters. I just started in beta.
