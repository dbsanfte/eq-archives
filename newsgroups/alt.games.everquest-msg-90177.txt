Actually, she posted it with her EZboard account to the rants and
flames section on the EMarr board (The thread is still there. Don't
know if it was posted to whineplay before or after it was posted
there.). This was the server she played on, NOT the server or
the name she used as a guide.

And as for the guides quitting because she vented in a venting forum
and word of it got around, well, I have to wonder how they handled the
idiot players Tweety bitched about.
