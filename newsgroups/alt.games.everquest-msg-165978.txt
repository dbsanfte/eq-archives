It's my understanding of the 'name filter' situation: They tried to come up
with a decent name filtering protocol, and couldn't so they decided there
was no substitute for the human element. So what they did was, there was a
very primitive name filter, it checked for active names and a few truly easy
ripoffs and lewd things to check. If none of those were present, the name
got forwarded to the server, where it was placed in an 'approval queue'
which was visible to all customer service reps on the server (GMs/Guides)
with two buttons: Allow and Deny (I've seen a screenshot.. it looked
credible, but may of course have been faked). Any guide or gm could click
either button, and your name would be rejected or approved. If nothing
happened within like 45 seconds the name would be auto approved (It was
assumed that someone didn't see it stand out as bad and was just too busy to
click approved.) That was what someone told a thread in whineplay oh so very
long ago, in response to a question of why the name filter seemed to take so
long to approve a name on Test. (there's almost never CS there so it lets
the time count out before letting you in with a new name unless it's taken).

Whether it was ever or still is true I have not the slightest clue. It seems
somewhat kludgy, but at the same time it helps solve the problems of a
standard name filter system. i.e. it can't catch everything.
