Well, actually... I've been thinking of upgrading my graphics card...

Is that going to be a really good one?  Why?  How much is it going to 
cost?

I vaguely understand the various kinds of GF2's and 3's, but nomenclature 
on 4's and up is still a mstery to me.  How can I tell from the name what 
kind of nvidia chip it has, which are the good nvidia chips, and which 
have been stupidly MXified or whatever?

I keep hearing about things like Umbra (well, a while ago...) Pixel 
Shading, and Hardware T&L, and stuff.  Is having those features a feature 
of the chip, a feature of the card, or a feature of the drivers?  How can 
I tell which card has what features, and which ones are prophesied to make 
the most difference in EQ?

I agree it would have been nicer bottomposted and snipped, of course.  But 
not entirely not worth saying.
