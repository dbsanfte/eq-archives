As far as I know it's random as to when and where they can be triggered. I'm
not sure if they can be triggered while you are invis/camod, but with SoW
you should be able to outrun them anyway (just).

The direct path is the safe(ish) one, so long as you don't suddenly become
visible - there are quite a few static and wandering spawns on the route,
but none of them will see invis. It is however a little tricky to follow the
route just from the map as some of the turns aren't very obvious, you might
want to get someone to show you the way. Alternatively, you could generate a
L1 warrior who follows Rallos Zek and use that character to explore Kael
first (followers of Rallos start off dubious to Kromrif I believe), of
course you'd have to get him there first.

Also watch out for Ronaldar (sp?), a newish CoV dragon that spawns in the
middle of the north zone edge. However, he doesn't see invis. The lake is
roughly in the centre of the zone anyway, so you should be able to pick up
your spells without going near either dragon except to pick up your WL
tooth. Camo and SoW would be a good idea, of course :).
