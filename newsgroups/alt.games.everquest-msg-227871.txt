Here's a follow-on question re chests.  

As they are selectable just like mobs do AoE spells set them off?  We
had a group that (luckily) survived a gas trap on one in our last
LDoN.

We all checked the logs to see what set it off and the only thing we
could see was an AoE snare spell (bonds of force) cast just before it
went off.
