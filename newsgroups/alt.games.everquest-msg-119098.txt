Ok thanks..  I've been working a list together recently to build myself a
new machine (which will most likely be running XP)  and had initially
decided upon an Audigy soundcard..

Are there any other devices/brands I should steer clear of?   This machine
is going to be majorly (if not permanently) used for EQ.. so maximum
compatability is a big concern.
