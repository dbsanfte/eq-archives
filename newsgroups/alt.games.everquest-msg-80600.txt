I know how to change  the transparency level of the various elements
that make up the fill screen display, i.e, CHAT, TARGET, BUFFS, etc
Including the INVENTORY (press I in full screen mode). using the/
wincolor command.  I can't however figure a way to make the data
describing an item in inventory readable, since the item data, stats,
whatever is also transparent.
 In plainer english...If I want to look at the stats for my boots..I
press the letter I and the inventory appears, usually in the middle of
the full view screen ( unless it has been repositioned) So, I now
right clink on the item, boots in this case. A box opens up telling
all there is to know about the boots, but it is transparent, as is the
full inventory display, so the information is basically unreadable, If
there were a way to make the item box full black i.e. /wincolor item
box 0 0 0 0,  I think the data in the box might be readable. I made up
the item box part since I don't know what the box is actually called.

Comments?
