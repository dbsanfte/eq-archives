: Well first off I will say that I'm all for this expansion as it will be
: great for us short on play time family guild types. My only consern is

: But the main point of this thread is just some speculation on the sort of

: They can have traps that actually work !
: Thay can have ambushes.
: They can simulate better AI by knowing that there is only one group in the

: while others try to hold up the party)
: While they say that mobs don't respawn they could have mobs that spawn
: behind the party to keep them awake
:
: They could put in NPC that you have to talk to, and depending on your

: guards etc.)
: There could be Mobs that on "death" respawn as "conversational" mobs that
: can be interogated.
:
: Humm lots of options.
: Anyone else have ideas of how existing EQ technology could be used to make

:
: It seems to me that they could make a really wonderful dungeon craw using
: existing EQ teck, with the addition being that they know only one group is
: in zone.

Reminds me of the old Flying Buffalo (and other) programmed dungeons that
needed no GM.  They did just that with respawns and had wandering monsters
come in behind you.  Should be many more possibilities without the
constraints of a programmed book format.
