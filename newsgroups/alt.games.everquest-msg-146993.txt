I was helping some new friends in the game showing them some places to get
xp, and we rolled up on the orc highway in OOM. There some high level folks
PULLING ALL THE ORCS. They started getting all pissy when we took just one!

I dunno, I don think there is a server anyhwere that doesn't have these
problems, but somedays are better than others. Even some of the now
"abandon" zones since SoL still have some folks being jerks about sharing
the mobs.
