In true roleplaying fashion, my iksar can be almost kender like if the
casters are sitting and medding.  (of course only with my regular guild
group).  And if there happens to be another tank or a hybrid on in the
group, the casters have learned she finds meditation a waste of time.  I
just love hearing the clerics yell OOM though now that we have two usually
they take turns.

I find casters boring actually.  components to carry, things to memorize,
switch and no action.  just sit, stand, cast, sit, stand, cast...*yawn* this
warrior must run around, explore and reak general havoc on my guild.

I even wrote a song about it once!
