Sorry, I'm not sure I understand your message in this context.

If you're saying "as if that doesn't still make them lame as hell" then I
agree with you.  But then, what else are these morons going to have to do with
thier time, go out on dates?  (yeah, right. )  ; )


If you're saying "As if...   theres no way you could powerlevel someone to 20
in one day"  Then you're wrong.   In fact I've done just such a thing, when a
friend wanted to make an enchanter and catch him up to my secondary cleric's
regular group.  It actually took us a couple of days, but then we had a few
guildmembers catch a ride while we were doing it, so that slowed things down.

Level 1 to 2 in the Steamfront newbie area.   2  to 8 in the elemental area
past the windmill.    8 to 15 on the yard trash in Unrest (very fast)  15 to
20 in Ill omen.
