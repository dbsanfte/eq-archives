First of all, thanks to all the kind people who helped this idiot figure
out how to determine what hardware and software he was using. (/blush).
I'm now going to push my luck and ask for futher help in safely and
intelligently upgrading in preparation for SoL. Thanks in advance to
anybody who can ride this out and help me. It might get long. :-(

I apparently didn't understand a lot of the specs when I bought my
second machine and was sad to find it was nowhere near as "uber" as I
thought. Ok, here we go... the two systems currently hooked up over a
bare bones LAN using a simple hub connected to a cable modem with
independent IP addresses: (If I've left out any important specs on them,
please tell me and I'll find out what they are.)

System One (my wife's)
Gateway GP7-500
P3 500
128 MB RAM
Nvidia Riva TNT (16 MB)
DirectX 7.0
Windows 98 SE
[Note: Has three RAM slots, currently occupied by one 64 MB stick that
it came with, and two 32 MB sticks that a friend stuck in for free to
upgrade it. I was buying the beer, and he had them left over from better
upgrades he did to other machines. The motherboard is the limiting
factor here, since it allegedly can only take 128 MB RAM per slot for a
max memory of 384 MB RAM. We're hoping that will be good enough and will
at least try it before thinking about giving up and getting a new box
for this system.]

System Two (mine)
IBM Intellistation E-Pro Type 6867-12U
P3 600
128 MB RAM
Matrox's Millenium G400 (16 MB)
DirectX 7.0
Windows 98 SE
[I have not opened this one up to look at the RAM yet, but given that
IBM seems to feel these things come in pairs only, I'm guessing it's two
64 MB RAM sticks. Allegedly upgradable to a gig. As you'll see below,
the sticking point on this one is that some sources claim the RAM for
this slot is "proprietary hardware" and "see the manufacture", i.e. the
stinking, moneygrubbing rat bastards at IBM.]

First question is for system one: I'm looking to upgrade to three 128 MB
RAM sticks for this one. Checking http://www.crucial.com/ I find them
selling a 128 MB SDRAM, PC 133, CL=2, Non-parity stick for 19.99 US$. 
However, following advice given here, I checked http://pricewatch.com/
and found several other sources selling 128 MB sticks for as low as 8
US$. However, the crucial.com page gives me a nice, comforting
"Guaranteed 100% compatible" message, while the others list varying,
dizzying stats. Frankly, I wouldn't know CL=2, non-parity, from a dead
rat's ass if my Mother's life was on the line. I'd like to save money
where I can and get a cheaper set of three, but I don't want to get one
that's not compatible with my machine, or worse, could damage it. How
can I identify if one of the cheaper deals from pricewatch will work in
system one?

Second:  On system two, crucial.com tells me that the RAM for my system
is proprietary to the manufacturer and I have to contact them. I called
Crucial, and the tech guy said its' *possible* that somebody else sells
a suitable RAM stick, but he had no idea who, and Crucial certainly
didn't. The Rat-Bastard's at IBM are certainly in no mood to tell me if
anyone else sells it, and they want a fucking outrageous 209 bucks each
(sold in pairs only) for their 256 MB, 800 MHz, ECC, 16D, RDRAM, RIMM.
(The phrase RAMBUS was thrown in there somewhere, whatever that means.)
Pricewatch.com actually lists a bunch of 256 MB RDRAM stuff for a far
better price than IBM's, but again I have no fucking clue how I could
tell if it will really work in my machine. Must I pay the rat bastards
the 418 US$ or is there an alternative here that will work? What stats
must I know about the competitor's RAM offerings to assure me that it
will work in this vexing IBM box-from-hell?

Three: Applying to both of our systems, the video cards are listed as
"supported" which makes me think that I can stick with them. However,
people here have mentioned that the 16 MB factor on these two models of
cards is questionable. Do I need to go to a better card, really? And if
so, how much better, what's a good one that will be compatible in these
two systems, and will I be able to install it myself? I mean, is it a
lot harder to find and remove/replace than the RAM is? (I at least
*know* I can find and replace the RAM.)

Four: I asked this in another thread, but to be on the safe side, as
noted I have Windows 98SE on both machines, and I like the OS as much as
I can "like" any product from Microsoft. But there are continual
comments that 98SE will "blow up" if I upgrade my RAM above 128 or 256.
I'm looking to take both machines past that, so I'm concerned. Is this
truth or myth? And if it's true, what's it going to take for me to take
both machines to a better operating system? Are we talking a total wipe
and starting over? (I'm getting a migrane already.) If anyone has a link
to any documentation that can either confirm this problem and tell what
to do about it, or show that I'm fine with 98SE, I would very much
appreciate it.

Last question: After finding out my actual specs, I was shocked to see
that the two machines are virtually identical in specs except for the
slightly heftier processor on mine. (System two). My wife's machine,
however, doesn't perform anywhere near as well as mine currently for
purposes of playing EQ. Logging in, the music bogs down and draaaaags
out forever. I can log in from the Log-In page all the way to my
character being in zone, in about 1/4 the time it takes her. She
literally takes four times as long as me. It's *that* much of a
difference. Also, I zone *slightly* faster than her, and she's far more
prone to sudden lag spikes on a regular basis, even though we share the
same connection. Is there any obvious reason for this? Or any obvious
way to at least get her up to the performance levels that I get on
system two? What could be causing this?

Whew!!  Sorry for the length of this, and I really owe a big debt of
thanks to anybody who's patient enough to toil through it all and help
me out.
