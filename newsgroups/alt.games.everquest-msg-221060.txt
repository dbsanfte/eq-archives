I'm afraid I KF'd him some time ago, convinced that he's either
incapable of actually discussing anything or merely a slightly
more erudite troll than most.  But I think I've seen most of his
arguement on this issue anyway just by what people have quoted.

Funny thing is, there's a glimmer of a real argument in there,
which is the problem I had with him earlier.  If I thought he was
capable of anything other than just retrenching his position,
wriggling away from any point anyone else might have to make, and
thinking that watching people give up out of boredom is a
victory, I might have joined in.
