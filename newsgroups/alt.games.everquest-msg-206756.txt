The myth of the high end game, and utterly 100% false.  Dozens, if not
hundreds, of other guilds fought those same mobs and were able to *find out*
the tactics used by the *very* *select* *FEW* who actually come up with any
sort of strategy.  The utter hypocrisy of people who bitch about getting
"spoiled" is mind-boggling, especially if you ever manage to corner such a
hypocrite and ask them what original strategies and tactics they personally
have come up with.
