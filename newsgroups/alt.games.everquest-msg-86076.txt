You did try exiting in the middle?  Well, not something you try as much as 
do because you're a dumbass who hasn't learned to circle-swim up tubes 
after 60 levels.  I was actually quite happy that I not only didn't die to 
that, I didn't die in several days of raiding there.  Of course most of 
the zone is pretty damn gimpy, and with 24 there, we were seriously 
overpowered for all but the level 65 mobs.

Is there a special order you are supposed to kill them in?  We were not 
getting the named to pop very often, and the ones that did were remarkably 
weak for their level.  Our GM has gone on yet another acting-inspired 
hiatus, so we didn't have the info we normally possess when we attempt a 
new zone.

That's a long pull.  We've found that it's a lot easier to just clear 
and set up in the hallway past the false wall, right at the top of the 
ramp.  We can rush the king room, recover and rebuff, then pull the queen.  
The Pally seems to be able to get it times so the second AE goes off right 
as the Queen is coming up the ramp, we jump out from around the corner and 
nuke for all we're worth.  Hell, even my worthless non-nuking self drops 
599pts of nukes.  Fear me, wrrraaaaa!
