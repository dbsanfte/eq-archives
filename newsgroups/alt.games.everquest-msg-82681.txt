VI isn't going to explicate say they're not going to enforce the
rules on a high-level, but it's still true.  At that point in the game
reputation among players is a lot more important than earlier.
You can change the name of a level 20, for instance, and he'll
still be well known (for good or bad) if he gets to 60.  Changing
a high-level's name means a LOT of people who seek him out
(or avoid him) no longer know up front.

It's pretty much the same reason for the rules about changing
servers:  VI doesn't want players to escape their reputations
easily.
