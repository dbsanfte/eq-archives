When reading reviews posted to newsgroups, it is a good idea to look
up the poster on google.  Cam has well over 700 posts on google, in
many groups.  If he comes back later and says www.ibuypower.com
screwed things up, I'll give that some weight.

The poster who started this thread, though, is much less tangible.
All there is in his google history are mostly what looks like practice
postings of porn gifs to test groups, and not a lot of those.  I'm
somewhat suspicious that he's now showing up here to help his fellow
EQ players avoid a bad company.  Seems more likely that he is a
competitor of that company, trying to sully their reputation, or some
other similarly sleazy thing.
