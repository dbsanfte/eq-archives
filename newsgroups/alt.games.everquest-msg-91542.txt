Apparently Firiona Vie the server I am on is very different with respect to
languages than others.  On my server Common has a numerical value of 27 and
that is a "Bad"  I am a Halfling Druid and my Halfling has a numerical value
of 92 "Master"  I have a "Feeble" in Dwarf with no numerical value.

I think you may be wrong about only being able to train someone to your
level.  I think you can train someone to one level higer than yours - this
allows you to ladder each other.  Do you know that you need to zone for the
language skill improvement to truly kick in?

My Guild Trainer will not let me put points on any language except Common
(which I have been doing) and Halfling (no way!).
