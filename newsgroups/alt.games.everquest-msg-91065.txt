I no longer crash while zoning. 

ATI users can play now.

Woot! So can GeForce users!

Those are all bug fixes. Just because they did not fix the bug *you* notice 
does *not* mean they have their thumbs up their asses.

The patch messages make clear things they have done... as for 
"disinformation", what are you talking about? And if you are about to say 
"It was down an hour more than they said!" then shut up right now, as I do 
not care to listen to you blubber.

Just because code is not tested on every possible hardware combination does 
not make it untested.

Really? Unstable? The last month I have not *once* gone linkdead. There 
have been two SCHEDULED patches, minor zone fixes, and ONE unscheduled 
emergency patch.

I don't want to sound like a Verant lapdog, but Christ people, cut the guys 
some slack!
