Kill everything and watch for skeltons to pop, so you find out where 
they do, then you only have to kill stuff in that area.

IIRC, grimlings and grimling skeletons spawn in the same spots, but the 
skeletons spawn at night and the live grimlings during the day.  Only 
trouble is, on the moon there's no way to tell time, so you can only 
find out by asking people on Kunark itself, to check for you (well, you 
can also tell by watching the sky, I think, but I tend to have that 
turned off, and forget whether Kunark is in the sky at "night" or during 
the "day?

Anyway, if you are in the right area and killing everything, you'll see 
several spawns, and they will keep repopping for quite a while.

Similarly, the Young Rockhoppers seem nearly impossible to find for a 
while, till you pin down their spawn area; trouble is they roam away 
from it so you have to hunt them all down at first, then keep killing 
them off before they roam so you can stay in one area.
