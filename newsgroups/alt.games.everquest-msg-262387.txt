I feel the same way but will probably end up trying Eq2 anyway. I tired of
Daoc, shadowbane etc
Never tried SWG or CoH. May try WoW. But EQ I do return to as well.
It has a lot of content and playability regardless of how much can still be
improved.

One Demo I really enjoyed was a Guildwars open beta demo.
Better play than many finished games . Diverse play options.
When you only play a few days its really hard to judge what long term appeal
it will have.
