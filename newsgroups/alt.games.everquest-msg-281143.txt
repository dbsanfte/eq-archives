I know of 4, Lavastorm, Nek Forest, Lesser Faydark and Butcherblock.

They are group events.

So far we've tried the Lavastorm one (Nagafen) best fun I've had in EQ for
a long time based on effort vs. laughter (raiding is huge fun for me, but
doesn't always have much laughter ;)), and the Butcherblock one (which is
Gunthak Pirates invading Freeport) which was amusing, but not as much pure
fun as the Naggy one.
