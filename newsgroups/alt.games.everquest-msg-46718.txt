  I was waiting for someone to mention that. The thing with the Israelis and
their struggle with terrorism is that they never were allowed to truly go
after them. Yes, they would react to attacks and may have even stopped some
but I'm talking about directing a nation towards the goal of putting an end
to terrorism. Plus they're in a unique position where they land they're
occupying is disputed. What we're planning is not the same thing. Israel
fights terrorists who think they're being subjugated and are fighting to
drive them off their land. We're fighting terrorists period. We're not
subjugating anyone. We're going after people who take delight in killing
people for no other reason than those people don't practice the same
religion. Now do you see the difference?
