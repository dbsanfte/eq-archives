You and half the server.  I -hate- Velks.  It used to be a really nice zone,
but then the LOIO/DL/KC crowd discovered it.  Now it just isn't all that
pleasant a place to go, even if the XP is nice.

Every server has different names for the camps there.  My advice is to avoid
the initial area, with all the ramps and such.  Too many people, too few
spawns, and too much contention for them.

The better and more unmolested camp spots are the gnoll village up top, and
the pits down in the bottom.  No loot items come to mind, but the XP is
nice.

If you need threads for the shawl quest, just OOC for them from time to
time.  Most groups are pretty good about letting people loot them.
