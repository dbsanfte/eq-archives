The difference is that login congestion is random chance, and trying 
again immediately will give me another chance at getting in and so 
forth; say one attempt in four is getting in, on average in four tries 
(and so about 4 minutes) I'm logged in.  On the other hand, if the patch 
is still in process, I can try and log in a hundred times in a row and 
I'm still guaranteed not to get in.

Yes, waiting a few hours between attempts to log in will resolve that, 
because the patch will eventually end, and login congestion will also 
eventually end.

I've even made a point, at some times in my EQ career, of not trying to 
log in at all on patch days; that really tends to resolve the issue, if 
I can't log in after two attempts the day after a patch, its very likely 
something wrong on my end (barring of course the never announce patch to 
the patch, and patch to the patch to the patch...)

Well I said I admit its not "likely".  I've sure had it happen, multiple 
times, though, over the years.

Yes, walking away and waiting a few more hours does solve the problem 
most of the time.  And if I find out that I'm borked and have to fix it, 
its really only a case of finding out a few hours later than I might 
have, in the great scheme of things still not a huge deal.

What gets me is that it seems to me that this problem could be addressed 
fairly easily, by putting in a few minutes to change the message, or by 
setting up a system where the message on the web page is changed, or 
something; since patch is done by actual humans, having one spend a 
small amount of his time setting a Patch on at start of patch and Patch 
off at end of patch, in one way or another, well I can't imagine what 
would make this too difficult to do.

Everyone who reacts to this idea with umbrage at my spending say, a man 
hour of valuable SOE programmer time to set this up, plus another two 
man-minutes of time per patch to maintain it manually, well consider 
that they have roughly 100,000 current subscribers and that each patch 
lets say 10% of the people attempt to log in at least once at a time 
when the patch may or may not be over and spend at least a minute on a 
second attempt... thats 25,000 subscriber minutes wasted due to lack of 
a message, each patch.  Multiply the time spent on the project by a 
factor of 10, and divide my estimates of time wasted by a factor of ten, 
and you still aren't in the same ballpark.

Is it a priority?  Well no, per person its only a few minutes wasted per 
patch, after all.  But its been Seven Years, at some point you'd think 
it would bubble up to the top of the list of "hey, lets do a few other 
things to improve the game experience for people" projects.

Or maybe you wouldn't think that.  I sure would.
