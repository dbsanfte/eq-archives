The one that gets me.  I'm in GFay, and this big damn tree starts beating me
like a rug, just as I've expended over 90% of my sp.  So I run to the
guards, not realizing they "like" trees.  I'm running in circles, trying to
hit the lift button as I go by, thinking I can escape to Kelethin (I later
learn they will follow you there, as well, and can jump pretty well).
There's a huge number of people just sitting around the lift, some buffing,
all watching this poor wizzie run for his life, and no one raises a finger
to help.  Perhaps they know better than to attack a tree, because they are
forever thereafter mortal enemies, but it's still annoying to die with so
much potential help around.

Cheers,
Eric
