Last I heard McDonalds weren't putting ingredients known to be Highly addictive
into their BigMacs.
The tobaco companies are absurdly guilty of killing people. Nicotine was added
simply as a way of ensuring a very loyal customer base. The tobacco companies
then went onto to deny that nicotine was even addictive, despite claims from
the scientific community that it is indeed the most addictive substance known
to man.
Then they proceeded to criminally cover up all information pointing to the
above and all the toxic shit and chemicals (of which around 1500 are still
unknown) lead to everything from emphysemia to numerous cancers and heart
disease.
They advertised smoking as safe, while fully aware that it wasn't.
They claimed smoking was habit forming rather than addictive, while in
possesion of proof to the contary.
Among their other heinous crimes are : purposefully gearing ad-campaigns toward
children and bribing members of the medical and scientific communities.
Sure, they're not guilty of forcing you to smoke, the choice is yours, but of
killing people they most assuredly are.
