I'm getting EQ Platinum delivered to me. Has all expansions except for 
Omens on it, apparently. The previous set was Evolutions and that had 
all but GoD on it, I think - perhaps it didn't have GoD or LDoN...

US$29.95 -- shipping was more than the actual set <sigh> (US$37 or 
something)...

I'm just trying to work out why its been sitting in Ontario, CA for the 
past two days after having done this;

Aberdeen, SD, USA (September 15th - 5:38 P.M.)
Arriving in Sioux Falls, SD, USA (September 15th - 8:31 P.M.)
Arriving in Louisville, KY, USA (September 16th - 12:31 A.M.)
Arriving in Ontario, CA, USA (September 16th - 4:41 A.M.)

Why hasn't it done anything since? Anyone know anything about UPS? :-/

A.C.
