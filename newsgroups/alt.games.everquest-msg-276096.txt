I have been playing EQ2 since it came out.  I like to play for short
amounts of time (an hour or so - sometimes less) which is not very
rewarding in EQ2 so I decided to try WoW instead.  I enjoy both games a
lot but something is missing from both of them when compared to EQ1.
I've been thinking about it and I have come to the conclusion that the
missing element is excitement.  Close fights in WoW do not seem to be
as exciting as in EQ2 and they don't seem to match the excitement of a
close call in EQ1.

One reason why they don't seem to be as exciting in WoW is that, in my
limited experience (now level 11), it seems much more predictable who
is going to win in WoW.  My health bar seems to drop at a fairly fixed
rate as does the enemy's health bar.  With EQ2's HOs this is less
constant.  You can get a buff HO two or three times in a row or just
simply fail to land the next ability required in the HO.  This can turn
a fight that you are easily winning into a close run thing or it could
end up killing you.  On the other hand you can get a run of good HOs
turning a bad situation into a close win.

Another reason that I think EQ1 has a bit more excitement is the death
penalty.  I don't mean the loss of experience and the chance at losing
a level.  I mean the fact that all your stuff is on your corpse and you
have to go and get it.  This can prove to be a quest in itself with
lots of problems to overcome.  You will be underpowered without your
best gear. You may not have been paying attention to where you were in
the zone and may have difficulty finding your corpse.  It may be behind
a locked door with the key to get through the door on your corpse.  It
may be behind a number of dangerous mobs in a dungeon.  There are all
sorts of problems to overcome with a great incentive to try - you would
be without your best gear for a week if you can't get it.  The
incentive to find your corpse (or shard) in WoW and EQ2 is much less.
In WoW you'll have to lose some experience and in EQ2 you'll have a
debuff applied to you for a few days.  This is hardley comparable to
EQ1.

I know corpse runs are a bitch in EQ1 but does that enhance the
excitement and enjoyment of the game to compensate?  I think that it
does - what do other people think?
