Merchants don't have any kind of pathing associated with them except when
there fighting, would be my guess. Maybe Verant never expected them to
move...

This happens quite a lot when merchants are attacked by mobs or accidentally
(usually) attacked by players. The only solutions are to call a GM, kill the
merchant, or wait until the next server reset. Bit of a bugger really,
especially if you're someplace like Erud's Crossing where there is only one
merchant.
