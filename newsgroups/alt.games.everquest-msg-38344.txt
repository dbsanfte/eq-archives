Yep, almost the same exact thing happened to me. I in NK hanging out by that
tree Xanuusus.  Anyone who knows that area well knows that there are no mobs
within a fairly large radius of him.  I did /q so I didn't have to wait for
the 30 seconds of camping.  After a couple days I come on, I'm at my bind
point and my stuff is gone.  I had no clue what happened and after looking
through my logs I realized that I was in NK last, and sure enough, there is
my corpse--almost halfway across the zone from where I quit.  I can't
believe I died because I was so far away from any mobs and there isn't even
much in NK that could have killed me in the 20 or 30 seconds it usually
takes for the server to log you off after going LD or doing /q.  Damned
bugs.. ;-)
