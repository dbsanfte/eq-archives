I have noticed lately that Bih'Li overwrites higher level SoWs now.  I used
to constantly have to tell everyone I was casting and if they wanted it, to
drop SoW.  It does not overwrite SoE or Wolf form however.  Of course, now I
have to make sure that everyone actually wants it before I cast it in group,
not that I've ever had anyone complain, well except for a bard, but they
don't count.
