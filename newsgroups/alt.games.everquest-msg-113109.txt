I totally agree and using my best low level pp producing methods CB DF belts
etc - I was barely able to buy the bare minimum spells at levels. So I ended
up in Oasis with a cleric partly in cloth and leather with no magic items -
and only a partial spell list. I have never been inspected so often as my
cloth tunic cleric went lfg. I almost look like a cr!  However, the skills
will catch up in a couple levels so do not fret them. But I was used to more
pp along the way - Also another issue is you rocket from 1 to 4 and 8 so
fast you do not have time to grasp some of the aspects of the spells - just
nuke and bash away. So more to think about - as we move into another patch.
By the way 10 to 14 seemed - my imagination?? to go slower than with my
other chars - I might be wrong on that.
Lvl 20 druid - very fun
Lvl 15 cleric - nekkid and able to give a 0 exp rez (lol) - It is easier to
go two zones and have full mana and no rez effects!!!
