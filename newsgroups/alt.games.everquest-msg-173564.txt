And "this" is the point where your understanding of it falls off the
beam. The people running the raid (and the guild's loot distribution
system) don't care about all the raids in the past either. But they also
don't care about "THIS" raid. They care about the *NEXT* fifty raids,
particularly when you are no longer raiding in the current place but
move on to the next harder place where those upgrades will be needed.

If it's an honor award system (used in many guilds, and we do it as well
in certain circumstances) I'm giving those items to the people of your
class who show up all the time as an investment in the future of the
raid force. You'll get yours after they have them. If it's a DKP system,
the constant raiders will will have more points to outbid you until they
all have that item, which is as it should be.

In either case, you will still get your items. You'll just get them
after the people who show up consistently and contribute more *on an
ongoing basis* than you do, have those types of items.

Again, sucks for the casual player, no doubt. But it's the only way that
works to keep the guild force, as an entity, as healthy and competitive
as possible and maximise their power and capabilities for upcoming
encounters.
