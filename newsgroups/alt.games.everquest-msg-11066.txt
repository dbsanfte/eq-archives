Hi, there...
My name is Rick Broida, and I'm writing an online-gaming feature for
Computer Shopper Magazine (www.computershopper.com). I'd like to interview a
couple of die-hard EverQuest fans, essentially asking a few questions about
your experiences with the game, whether or not you find it addicting, etc.
Pretty low-key stuff.

Please respond by e-mailing me back with your consent for a quick interview.
I'll then e-mail you (or call if you prefer) with the questions. I would
prefer to deal with folks who are at least 18, as Computer Shopper's
readership is generally a bit older.

Thanks! Looking forward to hearing from you...

Rick Broida

P.S. If you're reading this after May 31, please consider this message void,
as I hope to have enough respondents by then.
