No one said that people *shouldn't* tell secrets.  He just explained why
some didn't *want* to give up secrets.  A person that says or implies that
someone should or has to *give* secrets or anything else is a beggar.  If
you are not a beggar then just accept their reasons for not giving up the
secrets.
