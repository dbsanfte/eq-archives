You must be a big fan of Egyptian culture, cause you certainly are stuck
in de' Nial.
(Bah DUM bum. CHING!)

Yes, bards are one class that can add *something* to a group at a far
earlier level. However, you can't be so blind as to think that a 55 to
65 bard wouldn't have brought a lot *more* to the table. Plus, if they
*did* draw aggro in a bad spot, would be less of a burden and have a
higher survivial chance.

By your theory, I could take my level 38 ranger twink in there. Shoot,
even if they have a Cleric and a CHeal druid, my little heal spells will
still help *some*, won't it? I mean, Heals never get resisted. Heck, for
that matter, I could bring my level 19 chanter along instead. If all
they have is a bard, then breeze stacks with your mana song, right? And
more mana is better, right?

Earth to skippy... come in skippy. :-)
