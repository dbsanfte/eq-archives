The points would buy tribute buffs, which granted various effects
(some previously only found on gear) for a duration that depended on
how long you could pay the point cost. Every 10 minutes, the cost of
the buff is deducted from your total favor points until you can no
longer afford the cost, at which point, the buff wears off.

There are some nifty effects: various focus effects, Flowing Thought,
"item" haste, regen, and so forth. Thing is, people could easily rack
up millions of points with cheap trash items (Bookworms were probably
the most broken, giving thousands of points for a fairly common forage
item in PoK).

I think you are allowed multiple tribute buffs, but I don't recall
offhand how many.
