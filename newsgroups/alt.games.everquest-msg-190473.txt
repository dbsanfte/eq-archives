Ignore Hand 2 Hand. Get the other skills up, remember 2HP = 1HP so raising
one you raise the other. Also rangers get dual weild so eventually you can
use 1 swords & 1 blunt, etc. You will want to keep all skills maxed just
like a warrior does.
You wont get skill ups on greens (there are some greens under 20 or so that
give xp these would work, but hard to identify these, stick to blue)
That being said you used to be able to get archery (and throwing) skill ups
on greens. Not sure if this is still the case......
