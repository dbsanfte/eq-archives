SOW potions, jboots, or tboots don't give mana regen.  A horse gives you
medding mana regen rate while travelling.  For soloing casters, that would
be, it seems to me, a great advantage when hunting in places that don't have
camps.  It would allow going out hunting for your next target while you
finishing medding up from the last kill.
