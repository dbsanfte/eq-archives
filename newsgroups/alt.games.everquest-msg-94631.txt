Interestingly enough (and I had to check again to make sure it hadn't
been updated recently) you can do a "Find in Page" text search and the
words "camp" and "camping" do not appear anywhere.  What is said, in
rule one of the accursed PNP, is:

"1.You may not steal kills.
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is
already fighting or pursuing another player or group without that
group's specific permission."

So, for anyone who either has no regard for their own reputation, or is
a career soloist who doesn't have to give a shit about their reputation,
yes...  in the OP's example, they did KS the gnoll, as it was already
engaged by the camp jumper.  Of course the reality inside of player
etiquette that governs most of the game is quite different. If you run
around jumping peoples camps and calling in the GM's to invoke the pissy
little PNP, then you'd BEST be good at soloing, because you are going to
be very lonely.
