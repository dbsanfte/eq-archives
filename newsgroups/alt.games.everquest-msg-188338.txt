I couldn't name any single item for that price.
For 1k you should be able to do a pretty good job of equipping him/her but
as a 61 Druid I would think you could farm plenty of items for the
character.
Unfortunately, there is no (to my knowledge) weapon for a Paladin that is
the equivalent of a MoSS or Noct Blade.
I have seen the Mace of the Fallen Crusader up for 200pp in Bazaar but it is
53rd limited :ï¿½/

Couple of ideas, Shissar Knights Sword (not amazing at 10/22 but ok for a
sub 20th twink and I paid about 20pp for mine) Sarnak Battle Shield are
about 500pp if you can stretch to that for one Item If not Clay Guardian
Shields are about 100pp. Luggald Dagger 6/18 for Piercing skill ups (about
10pp)
Armour, you could look at the TS quests for Blessed Knights and check the
bazaar for components...I got the BP without actually killing a single mob
involved. Otherwise the Ro armour pieces are pretty cheap as is Ry'gorr.
