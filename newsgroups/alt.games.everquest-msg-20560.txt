The stein is a good deal - the cheapest +10 int you can get.

My 38th magician has +3int earrings, +3int face, one +2 int
10mana ring) and one +3 int ring and a +2 int robe as well as the
stein. If I equip my focus item I have a total +28 int.  (I
usually don't, because I picked up a shimmering orb cheap
and would much rather have the 15ac)

all the plus int stuff cost less than 300pp total in
EC.  I picked it up at 27 ish.

If someone gives you grief for being under-equipped
<shrug>, it's not how big your mana pool is but how
your use it :)

Seriously, a bigger mana pool might let you pull off
one more spell before OOM, but that means little in
an exp grinder group.  mana regen is all in these
groups, and no one has figured out a way to twink
an item with flowing thought on it yet :)  The nearest
I can figure anyone would come is to twink a regen
item on a necro or shaman.

I was in a group with a twinked mage with 211 int
(I'm human, with my regular gear on I have 136 int),
he contributed no more to the group than I did, heck,
he was OOM a lot more often because he insisted
on using cinder bolts on the low cons.  With the melee
power we had (2 mage pets, 3 melees) the low
con mobs dropped so fast the bolt was a complete
waste.  We won't even talk about the 2 times he
over nuked and ran (instead of staying where the
cleric could heal him, and the tanks could taunt) and
died.  (and the mob died out of range for me to get
exp, grrrr).
