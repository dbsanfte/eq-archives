Yes. Incompetence.

Yes. One reason? Incompetence. But instead of putting their tiny brains to
work solving *real* problems with the game, they take two years figuring out
how long it takes to munch a muffin. Pathetic.

Yes, and the reason is that you, the person who pays them for this service,
are at the bottom of their list of prioroties. They prove this on regular
occassions. You can think otherwise if it makes you feel loved, but you are
mistaken. You are neither loved nor respected by Verant, and they take pains
to make that as clear as they possibly can.
