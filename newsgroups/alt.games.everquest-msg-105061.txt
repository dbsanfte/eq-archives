Shouldn't something that speeds you up lower your delay?  In this case, the
ratio would be 100/112 * Delay.  Or about 21% reduction.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
