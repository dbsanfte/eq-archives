Guild chat is on a different system.  There have always been two chat 
systems in the game, ones which used the chat servers (channels that you 
/join) and ones which didn't (/group, /guildsay, etc.)

Only the former are affected, as I understand it.

One of the benefits apparently is that conversation in channels will now 
be queued while you zone, instead of lost.

However, I share the same fears about the reliability of the universal 
chat system.

It also means EQIM and anything which supported EQIM will no longer work.
