hmmm, no PL and more important no KS

> 3) EQ2 feels is incredibly small compared to EQ1.

The world being small and that u can't make it through other zones are two 
different things.
The world in EQ2 is huge. Of course u *can* spend a lot of time in a zone if 
a normal zone in EQ2 is about the size of 4 EQ1 zones (except cities). I say 
*can* because I'm lvl 23 and I have visited at least 10 zones for farming 
xp/quests (maybe u don't explore much)


Overall, EQ2 is a refined version of EQ1 (and Im not just talking about 
graphics). They took out the grief and now game mechanics are tons better. 
Dying is still painful and u try to avoid it at all cost, but there's no 
more 2 hour CR, Feeling like u wasted 2 hours when ur killed, no more 
camping, KS, 50 people to kill a mob only for 1 person to get a quest done, 
etc., etc.
