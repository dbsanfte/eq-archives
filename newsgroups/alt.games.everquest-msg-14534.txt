Absor felt he needed to clarify?  Let's review the rule:

 "Any and all stolen and/or compromised accounts that are reported to
SOE will be banned, and no items will be reimbursed"

Seems pretty sraightforward.  Verant automatially assumes the
coustomer is lying in all cases.

Amazing to see a company actually openly hostile to it's coustomers.
