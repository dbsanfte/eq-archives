    As we were duoing, I was tanking the overwhelming majority of the time.
Interestingly enough, if im readiny yalp right, the nastiest the mobs got
was 30dps from the treants. Blood ravens were 23dps. I now realise the log
period ive got spans more than 2 fights ;)

    Bear in mind these mobs were slowed probably 95% of the time and I was
hasted pretty much constantly.
