Well, as a mage my mana-reg buff is rather crappy compared to just about
anyone else.
I prefer PotC with Symbol of Marzin as that gives roughly the same hp, but
also has better mana reg then Aego + TPP(mage self-buff).

Anyway, I don't care either way as long as I get a healer in my group. No
point fuzzing about mana-reg buffs when I can get from oom to fm in a couple
of casts. A bit more hp helps, but is not even really required :).
