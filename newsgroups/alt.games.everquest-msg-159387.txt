He got hit by a dorf going to BB. That's an abberation and easily
avoided if he learned from his first encounter. Following the beach and
being wary of the (mostly static) NPC's and getting to GFay is a pretty
easy feat even at the early levels. Yes, it can be hair raising, but fun
and doable.

If he's trying to get back west to Qeynos, that approach will still get
him to the GFay spires, then up, then down to Tox. It sounds like he's a
necro or SK, I'm guessing. Human? If he's bitching about Freeport vs.
Neriak. But maybe DE. If he's human, he's not KOS to most of the guards
and citizenry of Erudin, though he'll be very low dubious. If DE, then
he'll need to invis and use caution.

Either way, it's doable. I made it from Erudin to gnomesville with my
naked level 8 or 9 monk, back in the day when you didn't get any of your
stuff back and lost xp on those deaths.  Yes, it's a rush, but it's
doable. With SoL, it's damned near trivial.  If he's got PoP, of course,
it *IS* trivial.
