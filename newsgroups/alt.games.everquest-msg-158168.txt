your are somehwhat wrong,  if you go to www.everquest.com  and click on the
link that says in nice big letters on the bottom left hand of your webpage
free everquest classic download and key, provided by ign.com you can dl  the
game and a key,

however you do STILL need a valid credit card, or unused 3month game card to
activate the account
