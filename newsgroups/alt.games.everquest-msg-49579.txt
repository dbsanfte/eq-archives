First of all, dont you have to 46 for Fear/Hate?   Secondly, Icewell/West
Wastes/Sirens/Drag Necropolis would be geared more towards the higher end
(52-53+) of that range and would require everyone to be at that level.
There are certain places that, you are correct, arent worth the risk.  More
pointedly I guess my arguement should be that maybe the high end game should
have content that doesnt require a time investment of 4 to 6 hours.  Let me
qualify that by saying, I am talking about just killing for experience not
raid/loot type hunts.  When you have played the game for over two and a half
years you and half of that has been 50+.  The same dozen zones get OLD.
