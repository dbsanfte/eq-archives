Me and a couple friends went to hollowshade to get a couple of the masks
that Gorehorn drops. Now to spawn Gorehorn you have to kill beetles.  Here
is what we did:
We buffed newbies that were killing the beetles and the extras that they
couldn't keep up with we were killing. We had Pally, Druid, Mage and Bard.
So the first 3 of us were passing out good buffs to the newbies(we are all
above lvl 50). Druid and Bard always checked tracking to make sure there
were at least 6 or 7 beetles left up on tracking so that the newbies would
have plenty to kill.
Now the kicker, this 15th lvl BL logs in and immediately starts ranting and
raving that we are stealing all their kills and his XP. Tried to explain the
situation but, he gets real huffy and logs in his 45th lvl monk and says he
will kill anything we pull and make our life hell. I told him I was looking
forward to being entertained, lol. Tried explaining that it was great of him
to offer to kill the beetles for us but, that wouldn't it be more beneficial
to him to kill them with his BL, hehe. Silly person just didn't get it that
we actually were helping the newbies to gain XP faster and helping ourselves
by spawning Gorehorn faster. His response was that he was being the "voice"
for the newbies in the zone.  You know sometimes before you jump up on that
soapbox you ought to know what the soapbox contains, lol. Needless to say,
when we finished with gorehorn and headed to the wolf cave the newbies were
whining because the massive PLing had ceased.
