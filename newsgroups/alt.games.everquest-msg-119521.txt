I've used this tactic in Netherbian Lair when I'm soloing netherbians.
Usually I can pull one at a time but occasionally they do agro.  So, I root
my target and take the other one or two to the guards.  Once the guards have
aggro, I return to the rooted one and kill it.  Occasionally I get back to
the guards in time to deal a killing blow to one or more of the mobs I
trained to them and get additional exp and loot.

I've also used the same tactic on Mammoths in EF when one aggros on me while
I'm fighting another one.
I root my intended victim, sometimes as far out as past Megan's tower, run
to Bandl with the other and
then wait near Bandl for the original victim to appear.  Mammoths have long
memories so I've never lost one this way.

With the new rules, "death" kiting becomes possible.   If you are below
level 10 and fighting some mob that is yellow or red near (but not too near)
your spawn point, let them kill you while you beat them down as far as you
can.  As soon as you spawn, run to them and continue.  My little halfling
rogue has died as many as 3 times fighting a red before killing it and
getting all that juicy experience. :-)  Works best on a mob that has a fixed
spot it returns to when you die.
