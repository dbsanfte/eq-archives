Please give an example of a question that an *average* 2yr old would
ask.

The ones below seem more geared towards what a 5-7 yr old would ask...

This answer would be a cop-out..  "It doesn't really matter."???? 

Obviously to the child it DOES matter, or he/she wouldn't have asked. 

Why don't you answer the question fully??

Because a child of that age cannot grasp the full implications.. 

Which is what I (and many others) have been saying all along..

Which is what I have been saying all along.

And I maintain, a child of 2 is not ready to understand these
concepts...

You seem to disagree...
