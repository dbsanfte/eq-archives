Enchanters get better haste, but, yes, shaman can haste you as well.  Shaman
can buff STR, DEX, AGI, STA, CHA, AC, HP, SvM, SvC, SvP, ScF, SvD, and haste
you.  Shaman can give you vision buffs, IR, UV, and See Invis, they can
Invis you, Levitate you, SoW you, and give you Enduring Breath.  Did I miss
any?  Shaman can also make potions that will add a few more buffs to the
list.

In addition to that, shaman can also debuff mobs, reducing their speed,
melee stats, resists.
