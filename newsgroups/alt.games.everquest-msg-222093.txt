Not the kind you are thinking, though.

I was in BB putting an augment on a range item when my shaman
friend logged on.  Had two hours, we figured we could form and do
an LDoN run in that time easy.  Checked, yep, a 41 warrior in the
zone and several people in my range on the LFG tool.

Warrior is interested.  Rogue doesn't respond.  Beastlord asks
who I have, I give a list of the people I intend to try instead
of who I -have- (which is nobody yet, technically, the shaman and
warrior are on the way but not grouped with me just yet) and no
response.  Shadowknight asks if I have anyone from a specific
guild... like I know!  But I check and there's only one person
from that guild online at all, unless of course someone I'm
contacting is anon... so I give her a list of names and tell her
I don't think any are but she can check.  Warrior by now has
vanished.  Shaman arrives.  SK agrees to come join us.  I get a
different warrior who has a ranger and paladin friend who can
also join us.

After a bit, we all get together, thats mage, shaman, SK,
warrior, ranger, paladin, group will be a bit light on DPS but
plenty of tanking power.

One problem, though: we can't get a mission.  Shaman is 37, and
the ranger is 45, paladin 46... while shaman's high end is 44. 
Since there are several groups looking for more members in the
mid 40s, we decide that its better for the high end people to
leave instead of the low end.  But then the warrior who invited
them along decides to leave to stick with them.  

Now its mage, shaman, SK.  We pick up another warrior quick
(there seems to be no shortage of them, although the fact that
they are LFG does indicate perhaps that they are relatively
unwanted) and the rogue that I initially contacted now gets back
to me and comes to join us.

So its mage, shaman, SK, warrior, rogue.  Can't seem to get a
sixth, and we've been doing this for 45 minutes now, so we're
running out of time on the shaman; if we don't move soon we need
to ditch because she won't have enough time.  

Now the real ugliness starts.  SK wants a cleric.  Shaman won't
be able to handle it.  I've done missions with a bard as only
healer, with ranger as only healer... ok, those were a little
nuts, and we failed with the ranger.  But a Shaman?  Everyone is
willing to give it a good try except the SK.  We try to convince
her, and we try to find a backup healer... I'd have felt a lot
better with even a ranger or paladin as backup.  But its no
dice.  Finally, SK leaves the group.  

At this point, we've really pushed the time too far, and won't
have the extra half hour after the 90 minutes for a partial
success attempt, which we'll probably need with just the four of
us, plus losing the SK means losing our splitter, with no CC to
speak of it probably -will- be too hard for shaman healer.

So we break up, having spent an hour sitting around in BB doing
nothing of consequence.  9 people said yes and for one reason or
another we still couldn't muster a group!

Splendid One, 41 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
