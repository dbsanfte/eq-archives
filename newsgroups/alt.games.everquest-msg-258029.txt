As someone else answered, it's /assist off.  You can use
/attack off (or on) to turn attack mode off (or on), which
can be useful in hotkeys.  (E.g., my hotkey that targets an
adventure-camp Magus and says the name of another camp to
port to, starts with "/attack off" so I don't attack the
magus!)

You're right about the .ini file, though.  I'll add that it's
a global one (probably EQclient.ini), which means the setting
applies to all characters.  So you can't have one character
autoattack on assist while another doesn't, unless you make a
hotkey that says
	/assist
	/attack on
(or off) to handle the non-default case.
