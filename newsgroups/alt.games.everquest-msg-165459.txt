Its just not true though. Has not been true for 30 years. I will assume you
are talking about blacks now since they are the only racial minority that
are easily distinguishable anymore. They represent about 10% of the
population . If only 10% of the people hiring do not see color first then
there will be enough "spaces" available for blacks to find jobs based on
merit alone.

This 10% is today more like 80% . There is plenty of room for anyone to get
a merit based job in our society now. Affirmitative action tells an employer
that he must LOOK at race before any other consideration, and goverment
required discrimination on race alone violates equal protection under the
law which is oddly enough the reason we abolished slavery in the first
place.

No irish need apply . No chineese welcome here . No italians need apply. We
have adopted each of the other immigration groups already and they are
indistinguishable from ourselves now. The reason we can not fully adopt
blacks is that they will not let us !
