In a LDoN Normal mission with well geared people, you don't need a 
cleric to heal, and lots of people can pull; the fact that -you've- 
figured out that this is a job you can do well, so you pull your weight, 
doesn't mean that the typical "sit on my butt unless I have to cast a 
heal" cleric isn't a waste of group space.  I can't tell you how many 
times I've had the "Stop healing me"  "I'm FM anyway" "Then Nuke or Stun 
or something useful!" conversation.

I look at this the other way around, though; its not that the cleric is 
dead weight, its that if we have a cleric we should be doing a Hard 
mission; otherwise we are wasting our potential.  Sadly, I'm usually in 
a pickup group when doing LDoN, and I've found that doing a Hard mssion 
with a random assortment of people is often a recipee for disaster even 
if on paper the combination of classes is a good one; this means I 
normally opt for a Normal mission and only if that goes well push for 
Hard, which is great except that often not everyone in the group has 
time for a second.  So, in a pickup group, very often we aren't doing 
anything but Normal missions, cleric or no cleric.

Personally, I don't mind dragging dead weight around, if I did I'd never 
group with a warrior... and yet thats generally the most needed melee 
class in raids, while my Berzerk is quite possibly the least needed 
class in a raid.  How do you get high level warrior friends to raid 
with?  Group with em while leveling up.  Same with clerics; need em for 
tough things, group with em doing exp.
