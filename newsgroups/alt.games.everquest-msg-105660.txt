About usenet, sure, but I know people who know a hell of a lot more
about usenet than anyone in this thread (they administrate commercial
news services and moderate newsgroups) yet I bet they know jack shit
about EQ.

Perhaps you'd understand moreso if you came from a d2 background.
Crackers have caused some of the worst periods of servers instability
on b.net, through DoS attacks and through item dupe exploits that
tended to crash game servers.  In that case it is not an unreasonable
assumption to carry over to this group, as game servers are a favorite
target.

My point is that alien abductions are a ludicrous proposition, but
cracking is and has been a major cause for downtime for some game
servers.  SR is obviously relatively new to EQ, so how is she expected
to know the entire history of the game?

When I first started playing EQ, I was told that the inability to
minimized the game was to make it harder to run exploit programs in
the background.  I assumed that these programs had been a problem in
the past.  Is that not the case?

If she believed that she would have said it.  In the text she asked
for ideas as to why the servers were down, NOT if the servers were
hacked.  The subject was simply enumerating a possible cause, one
which she didn't allude to in the text.  I take it from that that she
considered hacking a serious possibility, not that she assumed that
that was the culprit.

I am an old-hand to newsgroups and to several gaming groups.  "why not
play <similar gmae>?" is always a hot button question.  I've never
seen an innocuous query about cracking game servers to be a hot-button
question.  Why would it be?

Bah, one would have to be intimately familiar with the paranoia of
this group to successfully plot that kind of troll.
I know that is not the case.
