Warrior is fully a grouping class, cept for outrageous twink regen
items which might let you solo to a point (but a level 35 warrior who
only soloed to that point is probably not a good thing for a group...)

Well it sounds like you don't group, since you say you never group.
That means that warrior and cleric are about the worst choices you can
make and then enchanter, rogue, ranger, shaman etc. If you really
never plan to group much, beastlord, necro and druid are really good
characters which can always solo. The jury is still out on beastlords
but some people say they are really great solo characters. With
beastlord or necro you'd have less downtime than a druid likely also.
I don't think of shaman as that great of a solo character because to
me it seems pretty weak and hard to solo with until you get the pet at
34 with 29 - 34 for a shaman trying to get solo xp here and there
being a pretty long haul.
