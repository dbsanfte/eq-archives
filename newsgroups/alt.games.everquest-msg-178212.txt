/boggle. No idea what you're talking about. What I said holds true. If 
you are a caster and you draw aggro and it is a very bad thing for you to 
be drawing that aggro, don't run around like a lunatik. If you feel I'm 
wrong about that then it is *you* who don't know what you are doing. I 
attacked the casters who make a habit of this. If the shoe fits wear it.

Don't know where you get me finding exception to your own take on the 
matter though.

Sure I do. You're just more interested in smacking someone down and doing 
anything possible to prove them wrong that you would never accept that 
maybe you yourself were just being a bit hasty in your reaction.

Heh. Guess again.

Speaking of pot calling a kettle black.

For crying out loud. Again, you come up with a high level exception on 
which to base your drivel. Go back and read the parameters of the 
original scenario again. I'm real sick of having to repeat them to you.
