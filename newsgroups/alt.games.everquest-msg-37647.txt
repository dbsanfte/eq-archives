That island is reasonably safe, just a few merchants.  The other island
where the FP to BB boat stops is similar, except it has an occasional pirate
on it.  All the other Islands in OOT are inhabited by mid to high level
stuff that would love to take a chunk out of you.  If you find yourself on
an island where there are seemingly no spawns, and you start to hear what
sounds like a giant stomping around,  be very afraid, that's the
Allizewesaur, a giant level 50ish lizard.
