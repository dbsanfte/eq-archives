The explore and check area type parts of tasks just require you to find and
enter the right spot, will work invis just wander around near CoM entrance,
maybe even the EJ side of the CoM zone. One I had was explore the tower at
the entrance to skyfire in OverThere zone, as soon as i walked up the ramp
into the zone entrance it was marked as completed. Hope this helps.
