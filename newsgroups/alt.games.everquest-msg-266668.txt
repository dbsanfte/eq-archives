I'm thinking of rolling up a Chanter for my third character just for when I 
want a change of pace. Chanters in EQ1 were one of the coolest since they 
could do much quirky stuff -- illusions, coercing, etc.

But it looks like they have split the two things I like best into separate 
classes.

Any thoughts which of the two would be more fun to just screw around with?

I'll probably also use him down the road to do tradeskills, assuming that 
Gnome enchanters are still way overbalanced for that.
