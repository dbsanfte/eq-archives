hehehehe...the tree in Blackburrow got me.....and I was lost for days!
There weren't any maps at the time and I had never heard of alla or any of
the other resources (pardon my newbieness!).

I ended up going down to the bottom level with death the only thing to greet
me - luckily a guildie came back with me and helped find my body.
It was a long time before I went back there, then it was with a
vengeance....

RAWRRRRR
