I would try a Monk, possibly human if you are worried about aggro in certain
cities.  I play alot of characters (mostly casters) and the Monk is the one
I actually like exploring rather then the normal routine of exp grinding.  I
can Feign Death, Mend and bind my wounds so I have little downtime.  I have
an Iksar cause I like to be able to kill just about anything without regard
to faction.  The FD is so nice no more zoning aggro trying to find zone
lines in dungeons and such.
