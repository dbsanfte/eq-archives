The DE in WC have no faction and are indiff to all as far as I know.  I
hunted them for experience for a while around level 30/31, then they
were removed from Erollisi Marr (Except for Kizdean Gix/Dragoon zytl). 
You will have difficulty in killing any mob named dragoon in Nek forest,
the rest i would imagine won't even offer experience any more or not
much if they do.
