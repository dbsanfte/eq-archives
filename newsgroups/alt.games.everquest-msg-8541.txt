Its been a long time since I've done this, but you can also take greater
lightstones to the gypsy camp in NK and turn in to one of the gypsies.  I
can't remember what words trigger her request for the lightstones, but once
you give them to her, she gives you a book in return.  You can sell the book
right back to her for alot more than what the lightstones would have been
worth.
