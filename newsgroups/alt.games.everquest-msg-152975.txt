}Oops...forgot to mention that part.  I believe I remember reading that the
}limit was "/pause 100", or a 10 second time since you don't really need more
}than that in EQ.  That would give 40 second pause before task (4 lines then
}task).

Naah, I'm sure it's more than that.  I was using /pause a lot when I was 
sitting around training up skills on my monk.  I'm fairly sure I got it to 
pause for the entire cycle time of mend (about 6 min).

}I was thinking along the lines of a gutter type of layout, with the

}hits it, then rolls off of the keyboard.

Yuh, half a hose = gutter.  I thought the ball might have to fall from some 
height, though, in order to actually press the key.  And if you use a nice 
bouncy ball, it'll probably proceed from there to break your grandmother's 
antique vase, annoy the cat, and eventually end up in the sink, without 
pressing any other keys. :)

}Setting the VCR software ins't a problem.  It does automatically start with
}Windows also.  The problem is consider the strain in the following
}situation.

<situation snipped>

}THAT is why I need EQ to shut down if left running.  I really doubt ANY
}video card (now or anywhere in near future, at least not til the 512MB-1GB,
}1GHz DDR video memory, 32x AGP, 2+ GHz CPU, type of card comes out) can
}handle that, or even think about doing it for more than a few mili-seconds,
}and that is assuming that both EQ & the TV software aren't using the same
}resources & wouldn't BOTH crash & fail to run if tried to run at the same
}time (more likely what would happen).

Aye, no argument that it probably can't handle both.  So you start the VCR 
program, get it all set up, and -close- it.  Start EQ, go into trader mode, 
go away.  Some hours later, the weird rotary plug timer thing cuts the power 
to the computer.  You go LD in the bazaar, etc.  5 minutes later, plug gives 
power back to the PC.  It boots up, runs scandisk, and starts stuff in the 
startup directory... namely the VCR program, and not everquest.  Then when 
the VCR program sees the right time, it starts recording, with no EQ in the 
way.
