If you're in a group without an enchanter or someone else experienced in
crowd control (bard indoors, anyone with root outdoors) then you're right.

If you're grouped with an enchanter, leave the adds the fuck alone.  It's
none of your business what they're doing.  The enchanter's job is to keep
the cleric (or any caster) alive, and the cleric's job to keep the enchanter
alive.  The LAST thing an enchanter needs is some no-brainer gumba tank
beating on a critter that's beating on a caster to get its attention.  Feel
free to taunt but you're wasting your time.

If you're outdoors without an enchanter make sure that those with root have
it memmed (well, at least a couple people).  Root makes for the 2nd best
crowd control tool.  Again, DO NOT beat on a rooted critter...you'll just be
wasting time and doing your damnedest to break that root (every time you hit
a rooted critter it has yet another chance to break prematurely).
