I'm just going to step in here for a second:

There is an entirely different relationship between a parent/child and 
"peers" on usenet. One is a relationship between inequal members, the 
other is between exact peers.

If I am speaking with a peer and say "Please do/don't do X" that's a 
request. I ask people to "please do" things all the time, and very 
rarely do they take offense (exception: when I tell someone to "please 
go fuck themselves" :p) If I'm speaking with my child or someone 
subordinate to me and say "Please do X" that's an order.

The relationship changes the intent of the statement in widely 
understood ways. Unless you're saying that Annie is Julie's child, or 
there was a pre-existing subordinate/superior relationship, the "she was 
making a demand, not a request/suggestion" idea just doesn't hold at all.

It's hard to judge someone's tone just by quick text, but it's usually 
better to assume misunderstanding than hostility, in my experience.

And now I will go back to lurking - *waves hi and goodbye*
