I doubt if that's the problem, since a) corpses are supposed
to last 7 days, whether you're online or off, and b) they've
explicitly stated that EQIM doesn't affect game timers anyway.

The more likely cause of your problem is something I've
seen from time to time (long before EQIM ever existed).
Sometimes it seems that a zone's "clock" runs too fast -- *way*
too fast.

For example, one time in TD (and *only* in TD that day,
so it wasn't a server-wide clock issue) we noticed that
our buffs were fading insanely fast.  We could barely
run across an island before we had to renew our SoWs,
for example.  We didn't think too much about it
(other than "man, that's annoying") until I died in a
duel and ended up at my bindpoint -- in Thurgadin.

Rather than run all the way back and catch a boat back
into OOT, we just hunted around for a Cleric to Revive
me back.  I was in no hurry, I just didn't feel like
doing the run.  When a Cleric was finally located about two
hours later, he got the "that corpse is too old to
be resurrected" message.  And we all triple-checked
the elapsed time (I even browsed my log file to get
my exact time of death), and it was like 1:47 -- well
short of two hours, much less the three hours allowed
for a rez.

I petitioned and a Guide answered rather promptly and
tried to rez me using a GM rez -- was "too old" for her,
too, even though it was *still* well short of three hours.

Then, I remembered something we'd noticed earlier in the
day but not paid much attention to at the time -- a guy
in TD had been screaming about how his corpse had
vanished in less than two days there.  I presume that
this was also due to the runaway zone clock.

If I were you I wouldn't muddle the issue blaming EQIM,
just /petition and explain that you had a corpse decay
well short of the seven-day-limit, and you expect them
to fix it (presumably via restoring your character).
Let them worry (or not) about how/why it happened,
just get them to focus on repairing the loss you
incurred due to a clear bug.
