   /massive sigh  Ok.  Thanks for the info.  I had been working on
getting my smithing skill up, but I guess I will give that up, and
save my money for the fletching.  Oh, wait, I'm also doing a bit of
tailoring on the side, and will need to eventually make studs and
bonings.  There...there is no escape for the tradeskill hobbiest,
is there?

Annie <--- Wonders if she can enroll in Trade Skills Anonymous 
           or something.
