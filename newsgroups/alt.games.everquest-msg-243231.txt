Initially they released no maps I think....possibly just the cities and
newbie yards were released though.
Specifically it was confined to the LOY expansion. Once a fair series of
maps were pulled up and available through 3rd parties they opened the
mapping tool to the newbie areas to all. It was useful to them to have
newbies able to move quickly.

Essentially you are able to make maps yourself, and the 3rd party site is
effectively a cartographer passing on the info.

Some zones WILL NOT display in the mapping tool, they are suppoed to be
special and mysterious. 3rd party maps are still available as they can be
mapped (if dangerously) using the old style run round logging locs and
parse it out to a map maker. Obviously not all zones are available if not
all zones have been mapped by someone who then puts it up for public view.
Some places are a bit dangerous. I don't know how much the instanced
zones of GoD change....but there are several maps for the floorplan of
LDoN Adventures out.

With the abilty to step out of the game a game really needs either a
ingame map or no ingame map. Anything else is not worth putting the effort
into as out of character events, and out of game events will produce those
maps.
So you have maps in game and let everyone use them, or you leave them out
and save the coding time and let the gamers produce the maps - a map that 
reveals itself as you explore is pretty irrelevant with the explosion of
websites that will accompany any game of this nature. The EQ system
essentially is a 'maps in' system now with a couple of oddities.
