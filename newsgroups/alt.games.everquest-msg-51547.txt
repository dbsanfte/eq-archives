I'm a level 12 High Elf paladin bound to Halas on the Luclin server, as
such I can safely say i've gone `feral' and ignore that.

However I think it is better to assume that the guidebook is simply
slanted against high elves. As a race that has high wisdom, lots of
`supportive' professions (paladin, cleric) and follows the belief
that everything that lives comes from Tunare I don't feel any need
to be an ass. Especially because who really wants to RP an ass?

If you want to be arrogant then simply take the position that *you*
know that high elves are chosen of Tunare. As someone with high wisdom
you don't need to constantly display this, how tasteless. Indeed I 
consider it a reason to want to help others and display the benefits
of order and light. It's not as if they can help not being high-elves...

I have more problem with the huge numbers of necromancers around...but
I assume that I must accept they are chosen by the gods of order and
have some value in the greater scheme of things.

Vulcan's would be an erudite model anyway. A complete dependance on
intellect to avoid/solve moral problems. Elves are wise and would have
a far more complex but intuitive understanding. 

And yes, I use what magics I have whenever I get the chance. Although
given the number of shaman's in everfrost I often get a free SoW in
return. I also take a particular glee in hunting vengeful skeletons.

Lit by a fire from within. We are the chosen of Tunare and our dominion
covers the entire globe save those parts corrupted and tainted by evil.
And we're *getting* to those bits with the help of the other living
beings on norrath. Have faith that the mother who made you made you 
well.

Be sure that I will give you a good bash to the head should I find you
disgracing yourself before the wood elf children. Perhaps venture to
Halas and let the cold, and the mammoth, toughen you. 

> Maybe I should have made a Quellious Erudite

Their failure is already obvious. Given magic and logic without wisdom
they are deeply corrupt. I fear that one day the civilized races of
Norrath will be forced to cleanse them entirely. In other words I see
far too many iksar necromancers and shadow-knights and I am deeply
worried.

Kireii, in quest of a surname.....

(ooc most racial descriptions refer to those who never leave the
home city. Adventurers are all a bit weird/brave/nuts and will be
much more varied)
