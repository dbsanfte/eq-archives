Its all kept serverside - we have had reports here of people coming back
after years away and the stuff still being there. Basically the size of
the data file for each character is so small that even with th huge number
of characters its still a small disk.

Client side storage of character details is why diablo 1 was such a mess.
You will lose all your customisation files though - the hot keys, the
layout of the screen etc. If you started again you'd have setup the
interface the way you like it if you don't use th default.
