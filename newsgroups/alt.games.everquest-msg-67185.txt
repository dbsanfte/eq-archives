Better than loc, you can purchase a rod at herbs and medicine merchants with
3 charges of locate corpse for 13pp. I always have one on me and one at
bank.

They also sells invis potion for 12pp, instant invisibility on a right
click. Usefull to do your CR or cross a dangerous area safetly (why clerics
dont have invisibility yet ?  :-/ )
