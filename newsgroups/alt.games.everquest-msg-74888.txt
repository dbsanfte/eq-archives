I'm going to call you on this.  Why do you have jboots?  Here are the only
three answers I can think of:
- to get from here to there faster
- to escape a bad pull/adds
- because moving faster is preferable to moving slower for no other reason
than it is.

- You don't have to get from here to there faster when you're already there
(indoors).
- At level 51+ (pre 51 is moot) faster running speed isn't going to save
your life very often.  Either teamwork or evac will save your life, and if
that fails, a CR is your only option beyond the 1/20 times running for the
zone is a viable option.
- can't dispute that one...it IS preferable to going regular speed for no
other reason than it is.

None of the skills are that great, I grant you that.  My enchanter's tossing
everything into INT due to the cap lifts.  A total of 10 more INT is more
useful to me (and considering 10 is nothing....) than a crappy running speed
that won't let me come even close to keeping up with a friendly bard when
going from here to there.

Disclaimer for the hell of it, I began, remain, and will continue to remain
emphasizing that it's a useless skill for CASTERS but a damned handy one for
CR folks and pullers.  Of course, when traveling from here to there with a
bard or even a sow'd group, I'm not POSITIVE the trade-off is worth it, but
hell, go for it.
