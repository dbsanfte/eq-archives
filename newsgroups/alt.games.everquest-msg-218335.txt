Pick a disease of your choosing then.

I can't think of many cases where it makes a difference.

The point is you and I don't have the authority to decide what 
constitutes an acceptable level of life. Where does one set the bar? 
Mental defect? Physical defect? Deaf? Dumb? Ugly? Or maybe Blonde 
Blue-eyed Supermen are the only acceptable offspring?

What is the real reason you don't want to have children? Because *you* 
don't want to risk the burden of raising handicapped one? Or because you 
genuinely don't beleive the child would appreciate the quality of her life?

The first is purely selfish, but reasonable. I would be afraid of the 
burden myself, and might even choose to adopt...or forego children.

The second... is a dangerous place to go. Deciding for other people that 
  simply because they learn slow, or have poor motor control, or any of 
a million other conditions, that they shouldn't be permitted to exist, 
and most assuredly should never be permitted to breed is a eugenics 
program on par with Hitlers aspirations to purify the race.
