At least you had a reason for losing your items.  Check this out....

As my sweetie is temporarily suspended due to maxing her Visa and I
have been waiting for her to level anyways, I have been doing a LOT of
auctioning.  I am rarely less than 100 overweight and often 160 or
more as I have LOTS of stuff I am auctioning.  Well, with only 26
people in EC yesterday and someone hollaring for locs on Burned Out
LS's I decided to head to WC to see if there were many wisps there and
then give him a hollar.  I was playing in Semi Full Screen or whatever
it is called, with the overlays (one hit to F10 from normal view).

I kill a Kodiak for exp and grab the pelt and the inventory screen
pops up.  Since it is a Ruined Pelt I click to drop it and miss and
hit the number 4 General Inventory box and it puts it in the spot and
I am holding my 10 slotter filled with goodies.  NP, I just re-click
on the pelt and it puts the pelt in my hand and the bag in the....HEY,
WHERE IS MY BAG!?  Not there.  I dropped the pelt successfully and
backed up thinking somehow dropped the bag, not worried if I did as
there is noone anywhere remotely near me and the closest are fighting
MOBs.  There IS a bag on the ground...Whew!  Pick it up.  It is just
the bearskin I just dropped.  No bag anywhere.  In that bag there were
the following that I was selling or using (ended up going thru my
auction hotbuttons to determine exactly what was missing):2H Practice
Sword, Helm of Rile, PGT, Bloodstained Fang, Bone Arms, Silvery 2H Axe
(just got and LOVE for night), Axe of the Ironback, Velium Warhammer
and 1 Orc Fang Earring. 

I never got any confirm messages for dropping or destroying and they
are turned on.  If something had been going by and I accidentally
clicked on it (I dont recall anything walking by) it wouldnt just give
it to them without making me hit the GIVE or Trade button.  Just POOF
it is gone.

I was told to petition it, something I had never had to do before and
got a Guide who was very nice but told me it wasnt within his powers
to be able to give them back and to try after 2pm PST when a GM is on.
Working 3rd shift I got up about 8:30EST (5:30pm PST) and tried and
got another guide who confirmed that they dont have that power and
that the morning guide apparently didnt know that the GMs on our
server were off Tuesday and Wednesday and I would need to re-petition
THURSDAY after 3pm PST when the lead GM is on.  I was told to explain
it in detail and hope he gives me my stuff or some of it back and was
told he "is a pretty fair guy".

Well my roommate has an account too and he plays on Fennin Ro and has
had more dealings with GM's (all positive) and picked up a dropped
Wurmslayer the other day.  A day or 2 later the GM shows up with
another player.  The Wurm was accidentally dropped by him and my
roomie said the GM was able to determine from Trade Logs who picked it
up.  If that is true than it is cool I guess.  I didnt make any sales
yesterday with so few people on at the time I play so hopefully they
can simply put me back to where I was when I started the game on
Wednesday morning.  All I lose is 1 level in Archery, some bad faction
from working that skill on Guard Tolus :-) and a few platinum I got
from killing Asps and selling thier giant snake fangs.

As a level 21 who doesnt like twinking I have earned all this stuff
thru good trading and would REALLY hate to lose it.  I am open to
encouragement :-)
