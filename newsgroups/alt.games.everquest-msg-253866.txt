Hard to say without real numbers. I didn't look at the site thoroughly 
enough... they did suggest 23%, which is -less- than most middle income 
earners pay off their gross earnings today.

At any rate, by definition, there is some percentage-point they could 
put on the 'consumer tax' where the middle class will break even with 
their current tax burden.

The principle of a 'fairtax' like that doesn't imply the middle class 
are hit worse than now. That would depend -entirely- on how much the tax 
actually was.

Charitable donations, for example, would be correctly 'tax-free', 
without any paperwork, that at least is a point in its favour.

Overall, the idea of taxing a person based on how much they spend is a 
good idea because it can reflect their true disposable income quite 
accurately.

There are numerous problems with it though...

It fails to reflect exployment expenses as separate from income. If I 
spend 20k to earn 60k then I only really make 40k. Under the fairtax 
system I would still pay taxes as though I earned 60k though.

There is also the issue of 'tax evasion' on money spent outside the 
country. (online, on travel, etc... ie the fairtax system essentially 
makes vacations income tax-free... which is silly, the more you travel 
and spend in other countries, the less 'income tax' you pay!!)

There are also problems with tourism... attaching 'income tax' to 
transactions means tourists will find it -extremely expensive- to visit 
the US. (I suppose they could 'keep their receipts' and file for some 
sort of tax reimbursement when they leave... but still... a pain in the 
ass for everyone involved.)

It also fails to properly accomodate rx expenses, and other things that 
normally would be a tax deduction. (They stated explicitly that nothing 
would be tax exempt... a grave error I think, although I understand 
their reasoning and see merit with it... I beleive its still ultimately 
flawed.)

Skepticism is appropriate even without claims of miracles :)
