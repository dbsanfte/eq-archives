If you buy the Planes of Power expansion you will get EverQuest Classic (the
main game) and just the one expansion, Planes of Power. The other option is
to wait till EverQuest Gold comes out (supposed to be shipping as we speak).
That package, according to my local EBX, will ship with all of the
expansions, including Planes of Power. Seems odd, I would have thought that
would cut into the sales of PoP, but at the pricepoint (I think $60-70) it
seems the best way to get all of the expansions. I already had 2 of them, so
I had to pick up Velious, Luclin and Planes of Power to complete the set.

Good luck and have fun,
