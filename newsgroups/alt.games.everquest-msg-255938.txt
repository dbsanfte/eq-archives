Yes.  There are 4 names of mobs, and the pattern is the same:-
Unmezzable = Slowable
Mezzable = Immune to slow

3 groups.  Class would make little difference really... 2 clerics, 1
warrior, some melee with bane weapons, few caster dps, 2 chanters, 2
offtankers (like i said, we used 1 shaman per 2 mobs when knights were
