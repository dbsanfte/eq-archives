I just realized that in order to be a "good" man you have to work and make
money, my parents never told me that and I never figured that out on my own.
I guess I am not a "good" man. I would feel really bad about that but there
are quite a few "bad" men wandering around the city tonight in addition to
myself so I know that I am not the only one.

Here is what I would say is how I came to this lowly state of existance.

1) Father spent not one minute raising me
2) Raised by cable television and computer
3) Developed porn addiction early in life (age 12, now I am 28)
4) Was overweight most of my life including now, and so was excluded from
all dating, really never had an adolescence, socially still 11 years old or
so.
5) Developed mild schizophrenia and manic depression in my early 20's and I
think it is getting worse as I move into my 30's. Thinking is becoming more
confused as I get older.
6) Was influenced by some guy in High school who turned me into a
non-conformist and me   being really stupid just kept with it and it hasn't
paid off in any manner whatsoever. Actually nothing I ever do seems to pay
off in the currency of the "world"
7) I think my mother worships the devil, father is an atheist, I was cursed
from birth for that.(Took 10 years to have me and I was deathly sick for
about 2 years after birth, sounds like God REALLY wanted me to be born) I am
a Christian, and that is the only thing keeping me alive right now, well you
don't really need anything else, even if your life is totally screwed up and
you don't expect it to ever get better then at least God will keep you safe.
