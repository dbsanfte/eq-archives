It depends on how you choose I suppose. Do I go for aesthetic reasons
(which you could argue as being rather shallow) or be utilitarian in my
approach? What will assist me most throughout the levelling experience?
A popular argument is that all races level out at the end game, but it
takes time to work up to that point if you aren't happy power levelling
and actually want to see some of the lower end content.

So, having race bonuses are valuable. Regen is not so big and issue
thanks to the down time changes, but when you are in skeletal form it
might prove to be useful. Do iksar necros get an AC bonus too? Swimming
is very useful also.

Part of me thinks the changes to race XP penalties is great, but it's a
bit of a kick in the teeth for people that have played those races for
some time or made choices based on a trade-off.
