A lot depends on what you plan on doing.  For grouping, the size of the mana
pool is not as important, you, as a caster, will be spending most of your
time sitting and medding, what matters is that you attempt to keep the mana
output about equal to the mana you regain over time.  You do need to have a
deep enough mana pool to handle emergencies though.  If you are doing a lot
of soloing, then the size of your mana pool is more important.  I can't tell
you how many times I have ended a tough solo fight (well, not fight so
much), oom and down to 20 to 40 percent hp from cannibalizing.  If my mana
pool had been a bit shallower, or I had fizzled or been resisted one more
time, it could have been the difference between running or finishing the
mob.  So, in that kind of situation, more mana is better, and I worry a lot
less about AC.
