Well ... i was saying the fact that it's a knock-off is good. I mean,
it's EQ-*two* for a reason. It's a knock-off of EQ. My point was that
i think it's new enough to be entertaining. I'm happy you disagree; i
would hate to think i could persuade you or anyone with a mere 6
sentences.

I plead ignorance. I haven't played either enough to know my ass from
my elbow, and if i were uber i would still not craft unless my real
life depended on it. Except fletching, i like the idea of a ranger
getting by on his own...but haven't done it.

Well...if you think it's entertaining, great. I think it's a card
game. And now both EQ1 and EQ2 have a card game. I think it's cash-cow
orientated bullshit. When i think, "boy, i sure would like to pretend
i'm part of a fellowship that defeats a dragon" i am never thinking,
"i want to emulate highschool nerds who play magic: the gathering." I
realize there's a distinction between the EQs' tacking-on of the card
game mechanism and Vanguard's contextual integration of it, but it's
still a !#*(&'ing card game. Why not just make the entire experience
minigames? Yes, in a way it already is, but i argue they fit an
aesthetic of role-playing and card games absolutely do not. Magic: the
gathering can be fun - but it's not a card game. And by "can" i
mean ... i believe some people that have played it actually enjoyed
it. Boy, i must sound like someone pissed in my wheaties.

That's what you think? Great. I think if you have a good group of
people you can have just as much fun anywhere. If your good group went
to VG, then you should be there - that's what's most fun. Ditto any
other universe. If that's not a factor, i think EQ2 is great for
people tired of EQ1.
