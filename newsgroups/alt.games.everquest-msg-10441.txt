Never said Drinal was a hellhole :) I even have one character there
myself (for when I feel like speaking to someone I know there)
It's just that Povar, MM/Drinal and EMarr are the only servers I've
watched... and of the three, I prefer the feel of EMarr. 
(And that, in itself, is a personal opinion :) )
