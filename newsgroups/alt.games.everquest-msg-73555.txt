Possible movie spoilers I guess - read at your own risk.

Well on Dec 27th I went to see the movie lord of the rings.  I had never
read any of the books, and to be honest did not even know the existed until
I read another thread in this newsgroup (lotr name spotting or something).

Over all impressions:  Very neat film, special effects were cool and the
orcs looks particularly nasty.

Dislikes?  Far to much hobbit hugging... every 3rd scene seemed like bilbo
was hugging baggins, or sam was hugging frodo or some variation there in.
Biggest grievance - the ending... I was left like "uhh.. wtf."  I just sat
through 3 1/2 hours for that?   I expected at least the ring to get tossed
into the mountain at the end.  I understand that there are still two more
movies to come, I can only surmise that the 2nd one will also have a similar
ending except they will be a bit closer yet...

Question on the wizard gandelf.  Is it my imagination or was this guy
utterly useless with the exception being a flash light?  From the impression
I got while watching, he was suppose to be a powerful wizard but didn't aid
in the overall quest that much (accept for the aforementioned flash light).
Hell, the one time he did fight in the dwarf mine, he used a sword?!?!  The
final scene with him telling the fire beast to stop as well seemed a bit
odd.  I really doubt that the monster would have been able to cross that
tiny stone bridge regardless without it collapsing on him.

Aside from gandelf the characters seemed to be quite enjoyable and even
though I have feeling the 2nd movie will end with more hobbit hugging, I
will likely go to see it as well.
