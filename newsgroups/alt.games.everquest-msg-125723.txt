I have a blast at those lower levels.  Just run out the front door and get
exp.  Not much to worry about.  Finding out what a new class is like and
what a new newbie zone is all about.  The only levels I find to be really
awful are about 10-15, for some reason these seem to be very difficult for
me-but after that the levels fly by and I have a lot of fun.  The characters
class specific abilities start to develop and at those early levels the exp.
is very fast especially in the right zone in a good group.

I kind of rushed the exp as fast as I could for my main character because I
really wanted to get her to 30. (so I could be a big kid) With my alts I am
determined to level them in different zones.  I want to explore new zones
and try different things.  I feel like I missed a lot of stuff. Now I want
to explore a little more instead of just grinding exp.

Last week I took my 25 Shaman out to OOT and it was a lot of fun.  That zone
really has the feel of travelling far from home and seeing many strange and
wounderous things.  I met a little necro on the siren rocks and we
role-played the whole meeting.  It was a blast.  Not a bit of exp for me,
but one of the most fun things I've done in the game.

I also slowed down on my main char, because I decided that hanging around in
the same zone day after day killing the same things over and over was just
not my idea of a good time.  I just made 39 but I have had a wonderful time
getting there.  I've seen more zones in the last nine levels than in the
first 30.  I guess for some people the goal is the number 60, but for me
it's having fun.
