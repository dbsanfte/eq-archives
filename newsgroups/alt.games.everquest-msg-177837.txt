The timesinks you have to go through to get to where FoH is at are
insane. I am not saying that they don't have a life outside of EQ, I
am just pointing out that there is really no way to "manage" or
short-cut the time it requires to play at that level. There is no way
a casual player (ie a couple hours a night) could play at that level
no matter how well they managed thier play time.
