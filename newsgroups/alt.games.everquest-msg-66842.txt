Your message, being as it was just a rant and a pre-emptive flame,
didn't warrant an in-depth analysis.

A) No, I don't trust you.
B) Obviously it *isn't* fast enough, or you wouldn't be whining.

>the expansion is just not "well made" period

It certainly suffers from plenty of bugs ...

>look at todays patch message that tells you enough.

... but as you yourself have just noted, they are being corrected.

>other games have better looks and graphics than EQ 

Prior to SoL, I thought that DAoC had the better graphics. Now it's a
tie. As for any other games you might want to compare graphics in,
bear in mind that comparisons to other genres of games (like small
volume shooters) are irrelevant.

>and they work, period. Luclin does not

It does for me. I ran into quite a few people there last night, which
kind of indicates it works for them, too.
