Addendum:
I did a similar exercise with my monk (with wt of 14 so no AC penalty)
Level 32, 160 Defense, 96 AC worth of gear.  His AC is 665 and his AGI is
107
160/2*5 + 1.6*96 = 553.6.
Adding the AGI (not AGI/3 as before) gives 661 to the nearest whole number.
Again, in the ballpark.  It also illustrates the AC calc is different for
different classes.

Any high(ish) level warriors want to do the same and report back?

(note your defense skill, the sum of raw AC values on armour, your AGI and
try to wangle the numbers near your AC value).
AC buffs can be ignored as they just to onto the final total.
