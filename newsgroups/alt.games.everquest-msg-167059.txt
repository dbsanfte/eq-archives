Tarre just dinged 57 last week, and has 8 AA points. So by the time he 
gets to where he can start making AA points, I'll probably be about a 
level behind. When he finishes all the nifty AA points he wants, I'll 
probably hit 60 and already have all the nifty AA points I really want.

Well, that's my plan, anyway. :)
