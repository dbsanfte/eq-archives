Arg!-my new system has been up and running for about 3 weeks now,
plays eq really well-yesterday, i finally get the tv out thingy
working, and also do some tweaks to the MB settings-then i go to play
eq, and i crash to desktop after a few seconds of my char. being on,
as time goes by, I crash to desktop just before my character goes
live, but also a few times during the loading process?!-So I go
back-set the mb at all it origional defaults, switch the tv out off
and eq still wont work-durnging this, i crash to desktop a few times
while using explorer, agent and acdc(viewing program) crashes a few
times, a few times during this, the whole system crashes and reboots
on own-1 wierd thing, my main toon wes the first one i logged on after
the changes, and it would fo live for a few min. then crashed, now it
crashes on him after the toon selection page but befor he goes
live-with other toons, they will at least go live for say 10 sec, then
crash-my system is
athalon 2200
MB gigabyte-ga-7vrx-via kt333/8233a(ce)
radion 9500pro 128 mg vid card  ati hydravision software
soundblaster live 5.1 
512   333mh ram-the fast kind, cant member name
lite-on, cdrw & dvd-nero burn software
370 power source
2 extra system fans

to emphasize-the system had been working well for 3 weeks, played eq
for an hour the day of the tweeks-then the above-some mb tweeks, my
friend the system officer from work did were -having it find the
specific hd when loading and not looking elsewhere-changing the ram
setting from 266 to 333 and from 64 to 128, 3 settings for speed
-normal, fast and ultra-first went ultra, then knocked it down to
fast, now back to normal-reset all mb to the defaults
Hope this info helps-this problem is so frustrating-we did not
overclock or anything 'riskey' -just like fighting a ghost :(!!-thanks
for any help!!
