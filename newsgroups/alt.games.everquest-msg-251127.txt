I  was in the Lineage II beta for a few weeks, not nearly enough to sample
any of the mid-to-high end content, but I learned enough about the game to
get a good feeling that it wasn't for me. Virtually everything you can
dislike about current MMOGs was present in spades in this game:  Griefing,
kill-stealing, random and pointless noob PK'ing in noob zones, hugely
undisciplined shout channels (on my server there was a very strong
anti-American sentiment with a never-ending spiel of bitterness and hatred
going both ways in ALL CAPS), total lack of name filtering (I won't dare
repeat here some of the names I saw), and very little diversity in
appearance, you will probably look like most everyone you meet for a long
time. No ability to remap your controls, you're stuck with Diablo-style
point and click to move. I'm not sure what there was to like about it, I
guess the graphics engine was nice.

Some of my favorite guild members from EQ left the game to play Lineage II
and I never understood why. Maybe someone who actually likes the game and
managed to get past all the crap I waded through could explain.
