Happening on Povar too.  I get the feeling it started innocently enough.
The Centi Shortsword is LORE, and somewhere along the way, someone blurred
the distinction between shortsword and longsword.  They auction that they
have a LORE Centi, and some people with a non-LORE Centi assumed that theirs
was "pre-nerf".  It's very sad that this myth seems to be picking up steam
rather than going away.
