What waste of space?  I haven't seen a system for sale with an HDD
smaller than 40GB for a while now.  The only person I know who
actually uses that much HDD space (and more) is a digital imaging
junkie who's got well over a terabyte of photographs and artwork,
much of it stored on removable media.  Most people I know won't
even half fill a 40GB drive during the life of the computer (and
yet they'll consider an 80GB drive to be an upgrade, if you want
to talk stupid).
