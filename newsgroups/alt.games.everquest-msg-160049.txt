> 200degrees would melt the solder

Don't forget that the United States likes to keep their own standards. 200
Degrees Fahrenheit is roughly 85 degrees Celcius and would not even boil
water. (I could be 5 degrees off or so.... math has never been my strong
point) As I live in the United States nowadays I can confirm that Americans
in general think that everyone else in the world understands what they mean
when they mention degrees. Nothing wrong with that perse, just so you know
;)
