Hi All,

Visited Skyfire Mountains the other day. Killed one Dragon-like thing and
took a faction hit with ROS.

I didn't want to be KOS to Gorenaire so stopped immediately.

Does anyone hunt there regularly?  Why would you risk being KOS to Norrath's
Dragons?

I was there on a Saturday afternoon and only 2 others were in the zone.
