could be somneone getting sacrificed all the time to loose lvl (no rez
possible) or deliberately dying to get rezzed back later. Some raids have
lvl restrictions and it could be worthwhile loosing some lvls for such a
raid to get rezzed back later to original lvl. Naggy and vox raids are for
52 max, any above will be summoned back to the entrance. Considering karana
is not a pvp server, and nexus is a no faction zone there must be a reason
for these deliberate deaths.
