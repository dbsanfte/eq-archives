Last night I was sitting at the WGate in FP, waiting for a friend to arrive
so I could bind her, and meditating. I hear "*** says Hail, Darklet". I
don't get up, I just say "hail" back, figuring this guy wants an SoW. I wait
a couple of minutes, then get a /tell from him, asking if I can give him
"1g, 17pp plz plz". Yes, that's the way he put it. I lol and said "nope,
don't have that kinda cash on me" and went on medding. He just said "ok". A
few minutes later, I get up when my friend arrives and see him running all
over the west gate, asking people to give him money! I couldn't get pissed,
it was so stupid. I just laughed. I hate beggars. Don't know if anyone gave
him any cash or not, but while I was binding and buffing my friend, he comes
running all over us a few times. Bizarre.
