I am not just saying it. I am backing it up with an argument based on
the context of this thread. It seems there is only one person just
saying it. As others pointed out if a cleric can summon food and a necro
can summon a pet why not the mage.

I don't deny that at all. 
I am simply saying that a mage can summon these items from naked and so
they can be counted as a method for the mage to get around some gear
dependencies.
