While I agree that players can ruin an event... I have to lay the majority
of the blame on the GMs. Why is this? Because in GMs can flag things
INVULERNABLE. As I said earlier, events aren't fun is a moster is
invulernable running around killing everyone, however, If CT showed up and
was there to reward his followers (not to be killed) why not just make him
invulernable for the time he is there and TELL PEOPLE THAT. GMs can make
zone wide messages that give you the idea that CT is not to be messed with
at this time. "cazic thule is strenghthened by the faith of his followers in
this zone, you feel attacking him would be pointless at this time and place"
It would be easy (from my point of view) and allow CT to do what he is there
for.

*IF* he is there to be killed, then of course players of good religions
should go where he is and kill him. *IF* the point of the event is to reward
the faithful, do that. *IF* he is there to be killed, he should be killable
(not easily of course, but slaughtering people while invulernable for a time
and THEN becoming killable isn't *fun*).

I remember hearing that FV appeared (in FV of all places) and had some
people attacking her and her friends. She let it be known that she wouldn't
tolerate it. This was a justified response and those that tried got killed,
as they should have. ("are you a god?" "um... no" "THEN DIIIIEEE").
