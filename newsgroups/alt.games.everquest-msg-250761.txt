If a game life cycle is "make x year one, 3x year two, 2x year three, x 
year 4", then does it make sense to introduce a new game which we can 
predict will make .75x year one, on the hopes that it will somehow make 
3x year two, 4x year three, 5x year four?

Whats different about EQ2 that's going to change the shape of the MMOG 
curve we saw with EQ?  How do they intent to make the subscriber base 
climb and continue to climb, instead of seeing some growth initially but 
then a gradual decline?

I do have to say I can see where I was overly naive in claiming that 
spending twice as much to make half again as much is a bad idea.  This 
is because I fluffed that up into one term: spend x to make x, spend 2x 
to make 1.5x.  But that should be two terms, spend y to make x, spend 2y 
to make 1.5x.  And then you look at x-y versus 1.5x-2y.  Assuming Y is 
sufficiently small, then this could be a good increase in profit... even 
if that actual final figure was 1.5x-10y.

I'm not sure though, that y is really all that small compared to x, 
particularly not when it comes to developing an all new game from the 
ground up (even if you are pasting an EQ name on it to try and boost 
sales a bit)
