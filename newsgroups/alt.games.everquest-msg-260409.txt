Nice improvement. I accidently ordered GoD with a single click, and this 
was -after- I bought the box. (I thought the oder GoD nag screen would 
take me to a screen where I could enter the key... it simply thanked me 
for my order and took me to the server screen.

Since it wasn't a pre-order at that stage I had to actually call Sony 
and have them refund me the money.
