    Then I apologize for putting those words in your mouth.  I parsed what
you said into those terms, but I confess that I don't always read things as
carefully as I might.

    Ideal friends?  No, I suppose not.  But then, how often do we who are
forced to reside in the physical world get to have the ideal version of
anything?  Or even the cyber world, for that matter?

   I think that just by being in the same MMORPG, two people are showing a
basis of shared interest.  Of the ones that actually like to team together,
there are I should imagine even more bases for shared interest.  I don't
deal well with describing things in the abstract, so let's take the case of
Lance Burg and I, if we may.  Lance and I know each other from the A.G.E
newsgroup.  We agree on many issues of opinion, as well as disagree on a
few (I believe).  We're both married (not to each other!) have jobs, pay
bills, and are in in a similar age range (again, I believe.  I'm 40, and
from the way he talks I assume Lance is within say a decade-ish of me).  
We simply like one another.  Lance and I have met in Everquest, and teamed
up on many occasions.  Our play styles mesh well.  We are effective team
mates.  We have fun when teamed with one another.

   Is Lance an ideal in-game friend for me, then?   No.  Not at all, in
fact.  He levels much more quickly than I do.  He picks a character, spends
more time playing it than I do, and focuses more on advancement.  Me, I
don't really care that much if I level or not.  In EQ I'd spend hours
chatting it up, doing trade skills, wandering around rezzing and buffing
the fallen, that sort of thing.  My play style and his are simply
different.  I don't feel that my way of playing is in any way superior than
his.  Nor do I think that his way is better than mine.  We both enjoy the
different ways we play, and that is fine.  But when it comes to us being
able to team together for any length of time, it is far from an ideal
situation.

   I don't know if I've explained my case very well, but if I have you
might see why I would object to being told that since we level at differing
speeds, I ought to find a better friend than him.  

    I still maintain that since there are simple game mechanics that would
allow characters of various levels to still group together, it would be far
better for game developers to include those mechanics than forcing people
to frantically attempt to keep up with their current friends, or to "go
find better" ones.
