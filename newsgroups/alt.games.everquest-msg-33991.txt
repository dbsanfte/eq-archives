  Thanks for the replies I've been in the forums and also talking to tech's
this seems to be a problem they had with there short patch they had last
Tuesday.   I was playing EQ fine logged out to do something(change a diaper)
Then logged back in to be downloading the small patch, that's when I started
getting the violation error in the dll file that was patched.  No virus
here, and sure of it, that I'm careful of.
