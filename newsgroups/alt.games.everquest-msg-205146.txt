Must be class dependent then - Bards have been getting theirs eaten based on
being too low. There are recently been reports of prelimary turn ins being
eaten too if seemingly too young (a 35 had the guts go poof). GM's have
indicated to the petitioners that they are too low. In most (but not all)
cases, they have returned the poofed items due to the quest not saying
anything about the restriction.

There are multiple threads on this at www.eqdiva.com. I've heard rumors of
similar issues with the cleric epic, but I have yet to see that
substantiated by anyone I trust.
