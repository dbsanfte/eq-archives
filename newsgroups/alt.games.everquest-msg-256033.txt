yeah, that's been my problem: Engage in combat, drain all mana, finish 
off with a swing or two, sit for 3 minutes. Talk about boring. The 
problem is, if I stick with melee, I'm STILL having to sit for 3-4 
minutes to regain all the health I lose! Just seems like a lot of work 
to level up a Wizard.
