Oh how I wish I could have custom mappings for each character!  This 
setup would work nicely for my enchanter, but my ranger just couldn't 
live with it.

current setup is something like:
movement - awsd
hotkey 7 - q (innate camo in bank 1, eyepatch of plunder in bank 2)
hotkey 8 - e (range attack)
hotkey 9 - f (guardian of the forest)
hotkey 10 - d (use this when i want to forage or have a skill i'm 
interested in raising, like sense heading on a new character)
sit - ctrl z
camp - ctrl x
crouch - x
auto attack - b (wanted this far away from movement keys)
toggle-last-2-targets - ctrl tab

On another note, anybody found a way to map extra mouse buttons to 
commands?  Would be nice to get the tab and ctrl-tab stuff on the 2 side 
buttons on my mouse.  I currently have an optical intellimouse explorer 
if that makes any difference.
