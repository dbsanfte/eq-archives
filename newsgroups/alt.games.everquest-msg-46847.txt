A couple of methods I used early on when I learned roleplaying games....

Method 1... be yourself.  However, make it what you think you'd be like if
you were born and raised in Norrath instead of on Earth.  Try to transfer
your occupation or career and interests into what would most likely fit into
a Norrathian character class.  It puts things in an interesting perspective.
Just what would _you_ do if you woke up one morning and had to face
maurading orcs on the outskirts of your town.....Or how would _you_ react to
the discovery that your town's police force was corrupt, and actually had
magical powers to do something about it?

Method 2... be exactly the opposite of what you really are.  Let your
character be a sort of alter ego.  Are you slight of build and scholarly?
Try your hand at being a big dumb axe-weilding Ogre warrior for some bashin'
fun.  What if you feel intellectually challenged?  What would you be if you
weren't?....try being an Erudite caster and find out.  Are you an athiest?
Try life as a man of the cloth for a bit.  Do you walk the straight and
narrow IRL?  Here's your opportunity to find out what life as a rogue might
be like.  Afraid to face things IRL?  Try your hand at being the heroic
Paladin....etc. etc.

Method 3.... Adopt or emulate a personality that you like from a favorite
movie, TV show, book, or story.  (Change the name so the GM's don't come
down on you, though).  Pretend to be them.  Transfer their personality,
actions, and profession into what they'd be like if they lived in Norrath as
a player character.  It doesn't have to be a personality from a fantasy
work, either.  Instead of playing a Red Sonja or Bilbo Baggins type, for
example, maybe try playing what the Doctor from Star Trek Voyager would be
like if he were a Cleric, Colonel Hogan if he were a Rogue, Dr. Who if he
were a Wizard, or Drew Carry if he were a Bard, etc.

Roleplaying is acting, and can be a lot of fun.  Some of it may sound a bit
lame at first, but once you get into it, it can be a blast...not only for
yourself, but for those around you as well.

Too many players in fantasy games (paper/dice as well as in the computer
versions) simply get caught up in the power trip of riches, loot, and
magical abilities, and lose out on half of what these games are about.  Just
don't get lost in your character, and forget who you really are :-)
