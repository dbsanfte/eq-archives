Well, after some of the discussion that's been going on about the new
DX9 engine, and my fears that my (incompatible) card would likely make
me unable to play the game, I followed the suggestion of one poster in
another thread and fired up a char on test server.

Seemed to work okay.  Some of the lighting looked odd, and there were
a couple texture problems (black wolves in East Commons), but
otherwise, things went well.  Took a run through some of Luclin and
PoK just to test the heavy-use zones.

This was all on a Voodoo4 btw.  Fresh install of DirectX 9.0b, on
Win98SE.  Used the Voodoolizer 1.05 drivers from voodoofiles.com

Was speaking with a good friend who also plays EQ.  He tried it out as
well.  Voodoo3 pci (16MB card), Win98SE,  DX9.0b and the 1.07
reference drivers.  He also had no problems running around and
checking things out.

Just a quick question.  The current engine on Test will be the one
rolled out on Feb 10th?  Just wanna make sure.

Thanks,
