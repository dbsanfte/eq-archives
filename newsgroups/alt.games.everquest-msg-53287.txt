Read the post people.  I was asking about the sword.  I will KEEP the gloves
for another character or not.  It doesn't really matter.  I was selling them
because I can't wear them.  Maybe the subject line was misleading?

The only question I asked was: Is the sword really worth that much?

The warrior gave the gloves to me for a heal, I didn't ask for them.  I
appreciate his gift/donation/whatever it's called.  But even he mentioned
that my class couldn't wear them.  He was killing the mob who drops them
though so he would be getting replacements of a lore item.
