If your bard song is area effect (or group effect, or player targetted etc)
then you are in some way (knowingly or not) aiding them in the kill, thus
get a faction hit.

As for cleric faction hits... I see this a lot, but can't really explain
why.  When I was still low level on my monk, a cleric friend could heal me
once or twice in battle and not get a faction hit (velious dorfs).. if he
buffed me in battle though, or healed me excessivly, he would get a faction
hit.

When a guild cleric needs a certain faction in Velious (my guild is +CoV and
+Dorfs but we still kill Dain, Yelinak and WW/ToV named dragons) they have
to make sure they get a melee hit, stun or nuke in (whether they do damage
or not) to ensure the faction hit
