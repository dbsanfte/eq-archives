I'm building another system and going to have this one as my secondary.  It
currently has a VooDoo3 3500 card, and I'm replacing it with an ATI
All-in-Wonder Radeon 7500 (retail version, purchased from NewEgg.com).  I'm
running Windows 98SE.
    Does anyone have experience with replacing their video card in this type
of situation?  Removing a VooDoo and replacing it with an ATI?  I know there
is special things needed to be removed to get the VooDoo card out
completely, and then I need to make sure all is gone before installing the
ATI card so not to have any problems.

Also does the All-in-wonder Radeon 8500DV work well with EQ?  I'm
considering that one for my new system (running XP Professional).
