    Worked that way for my guild. Anyone that wanted to get flagged and
actually worked to get it, got it. People that didn't give a crap and hoped
someone would hold their hand through it didn't get flagged and moved on to
things where they could solo better (including other games).

    It's the same attitude that has been in EQ since day one. You put the
effort into your character to develop it, you get to do more with it. The
only problem with PoP was that developing your character bottlenecks you
into a few select zones or areas in zones. Had PoP actually had a larger
number of "open" 61-65 zones, there wouldn't be a problem. Hopefully opening
up the zones a bit will help, although opening up Tier III is just asking
for trouble.
