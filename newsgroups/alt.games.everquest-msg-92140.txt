Wrong.  For 15 employees working full-time at $20/hr the gross pay
would total $12K/week, but the cost of employment would be closer to
$24K/week.  Employers have a _lot_ of costs beyond gross pay for
employees.

One rule of thumb that seems to apply pretty well is that while you
might not get what you pay for, you sure as hell won't get what you
don't pay for.  $10/month lets you play the game.  $40/month gets you
what passes for first-class customer service.  You want it? pay for it.
You don't want to pay for it?  Tough shit.
