Nah...it can skill-up during a failed attempt, unlike Pick Lock.  However
it is true at the same time that skill ups come more frequently the higher
your skill is (until the "your level" cap).  When you reach the last 30
points
or so you don't even notice because it's like the first 5 times you hide
after you ding the skill jumps right up.
