Got some rather interesting loot from the Giant Fortress in FM. I
already know that the prices listed in EQPrices are often complete
bullshit for whatever reason, so I was interested in some actual
experiences of people seeing this stuff sold.
  First, I got a leg chopper. I had one of these briefly till I upgraded
and remembered that I auctioned it (seemingly forever) and couldn't even
get a bite for 20 P.  I found that a merchant in the evil outpost
offered me 25 even with my horrible charisma and faction, so I took it.
Stupid? Smart enough?
  Also have a Giant Foreman's Tunic and a Lumberjack's Cap. Not sure
what they normally go for. Merchant didn't offer much, but I've seen
them being auctioned before, so I didn't sell them.
  Rough guestimates?
