Nope. Still very much there. Still envious of its proportions?

>lying little asswipe you apparently are,

How can you type those words? How can you actually press the keys...
when you have done nothing but lie about me? Your motto must be
"Fabrication Before Fact"

You are so bereft of moral fortitude I don't know how you can look in
the mirror to shave each morning.

I have very few heroes; none on usenet.

LOL! Hence the multiple "personalities" and the x-no-archive setting?
Yeah, I can see how what you said is consistent with all of the
available facts.

You can pretend to dismiss today's posts as much as you like. In
reality you are *devastated* that your anonymity is gone forever. Nice
gift isn't it? A little like the favour you did for me.

Now, wherever you go, in whatever newsgroups you frequent, there will
always by access to your full, real name, which makes you tracable to
any looney-toon you push just that little bit too far.

There are people even more whacked out than you, Ronnie. One day
you'll trigger that button deep down inside which will make them
decide to take the virtual world into the real. The day that happens
I'll not be shedding any tears. You've brought every single flame and
stalker upon yourself.

Reap what you have sown.

Such a shame, too. The Ron Green who was stumbling his way thru this
new thing that was usenet back in 1996 seemed like a half-decent
person. He was laughed at for asking stupid questions and comments,
but as time went by grew more confident. Somewhere along the way that
confidence turned to arrogance turned to abusiveness.

So very sad that you continue your parody of lies and deceit.
