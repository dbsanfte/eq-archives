Today's NY Times has an article in their Technology section titled,
"50 First Deaths: A Chance to Play (and Pay) Again" which mentions EQ.
It talks about how Rodney Humble, vice president of development for
SOE, was playing EQ one night in 2001 and had his character die at 4
a.m. after playing for several hours, and that he couldn't just log
for the night but had to stay up and retrieve his corpse before it
vanished (I'm guessing this was back when corpses of players level 5
and under disappeared in 30 minutes).  He decided that wasn't any fun
and so SOE changed the corpse timers as a result.  

The article also mentions that EQ's "death penalty" is still more
severe than other games, where players' corpses are respawned in
various safe areas.

Anyway, the complete article is available on-line at:
