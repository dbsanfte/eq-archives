    I wish we could say this. The other Time guild has, until recently, been
stymied in round four, so they've been coming out to farm elementals a fair
amount. They've also needed to backflag their recruits and gear them up.
We're waiting for a second Coirnav kill before going all-out in Time, so
most of our time is spent in elementals. The guild that is just Coirnav away
from Time farms elementals, the guild that just has a Fennin kill farms
elementals, and even the Australian guild that is fairly new to the
elemental planes farms stuff (the easy Earth-A rings, some of the Fire
stuff, junk in Air). And there's one more guild getting close to elemental
planes status, too.

    We're eagerly awaiting the end of summer. Our guild has a high
percentage of adults, whereas the competition has a lot of teenagers and
university-age players. Once school starts, they cut back on their play time
and we have access to more things. Right now much of what we kill is stuff
that the other guilds cannot or will not, as that's what is up.

    We used to pull the Vine ring boss to the Gator spawn point, to speed
things up. Now, with better gear and Earth-A being bugged, we can advance
from most places in the zone and still make it in time. Last night we nearly
wiped in the aftermath of a Dust clear, but still made it in plenty of time
to kill Arbitor. Oh, as for how Earth-A is bugged: it counts each ring
killed, PH or otherwise, as one ring done. After four rings are done,
Arbitor pops. If you liked, you could kill the Rock ring at zone-in four
times in a row and pop Arbitor. This is helpful with overseas guilds, as
they might clear one or two rings overnight, leaving you with less than four
to clear the next day to pop Arb.

    The special, non-mold stuff they drop is nice. Some people complain that
the risk/reward is out of whack there, but honestly, compare the work to
kill those three minis with the work required to kill one Avatar in Air.

    Steep learning curve incoming!

    He gives an emote when he memblurs. After a while, you'll notice a
pattern as to when he does it.

    Oh, you forgot how the second proc requires two casts of GRC to remove,
so you end up with two people pretty much chain-casting GRC to keep the MT
clean. It used to be easier when the second proc couldn't be cured at all,
but people complained about how long it takes that really annoying effect to
go away.

    *cough* AoE Rampage *cough* Just curious - why was the RT in any

    Yay! Last night was our cleanest kill to date - 44 people, 5 clerics
(exact number we use in the chain). No bard, either, which had made the War
Chief clearings a little more interesting.

    I'm still curious to see if you can pop multiple Warlords at once. Now
THAT would be a fight!

> Loot is announced - a nice one-hander that has "bard" written all over it

    Well, except for the +Backstab mod on it. ;-) If the bard mod on the
item wasn't so important, it could end up being a real fight over who gets
that thing. The real fight breaks out over his other unique drop, this
thing: http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=16158 A focus that is tough to get
for a priest class, usable in three slots by seven classes, and it has
elemental god-level HP/MANA.

    Reverse the situation. Imagine you were the one who'd put in all the
time in guild, and a new cleric that had Thurg plate arms beat you out on
the elemental plate arms mold. How would you feel? They would be the ones
getting the biggest upgrade, after all. But if all you go by is "biggest
upgrade", then people would skip out on raids after they got everything they
wanted. Why show up if you can't win? Once you get a handle on that, you'll
be fine. =)
