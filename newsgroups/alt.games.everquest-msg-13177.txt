    Thank you. I've been looking for a reference as to whether or not they
were in that lava - looks like the GM was wrong on that one, if things are
as you say (and what you say makes sense).

    That's not what he's saying. He's saying if your X and Y co-ords are
such that you are in melee range, you won't be summoned. That's even if your
