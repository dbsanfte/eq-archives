Pretty sure it's like this:
Kill Dorf = +Kromzek faction
Kill Dragon = +Kromriff faction

And vica versa. Giants are devided over the factions where some give both
dragon and dorf faction.

Normal progress through the factions is
Dorfs (non-kos to start, kill simple giants)
Dragons (kill harder giants like in arena or KT area, hunt in HoT)
Giants (kill dragons in wtov and ss)
Factionless (ntov, dain, KT, LY, Sleeper's Tomb)
