Yes.
1. The answer should be obvious, for two reasons.  First, Windows XP is
Windows 2000 with a new interface and a few other assorted upgrades.
Nothing major is changing.  Since EQ works fine on Windows 2000, there's no
real reason why it wouldn't work fine in Windows XP.  Second, if EQ was not
going to work with Windows XP, all EQ players and their mothers would
already know about it since there would be so much talk over it.
2. The question is asked and answered no less than three times a week in
this newsgroup alone.  Is it really that hard to scroll down and look for
"XP" in a subject line?  I think not.
