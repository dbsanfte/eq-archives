My SO and I both play MMORPGs, me more than him.  Everquest, Anarchy 
Online, Asheron's Call, Ultima Online, various text MUDs... and we both 
would rather solo than group.  This baffles a long-time MUDder friend of 
ours (who used to play EQ but has since gone cold turkey) who wanted to 
know why the hell we were playing a MMORPG if we didn't want to group. 
He even claimed that we, as soloists, were being "selfish" and should 
just go play a single-player game.

He's not the only person with this opinion, or so I've gathered from 
browsing various bboards.

Thing is, what single-player game (apart from, say, Morrowind) is going 
to have the open-ended 'do whatever the hell you want, really' quality 
of a MMORPG?  More than that, I actually find it adds something vital to 
the game that not only are a lot of other people playing it the same 
time I am, they're in the same world I am, and I can talk to them and 
even, gasp, *roleplay* with them.

I like reading newsgroups like this one, too, and the message board for 
my server.  (And then seeing a poster "in person" at PoK!  Cool!)

I'm not even against grouping.  I just, like Sebet, often have limited 
play times and am, I admit, terribly shy.  And since I've never really 
grouped, I fear I'd not be very good at it.  :}

And I've never gotten a character past level 11 in the couple of years, 
off and on (many months off, admittedly), that I've played EQ.  Too many 
restarts, I guess.  And I was playing back when you had to do CRs a lot 
earlier.  :)
