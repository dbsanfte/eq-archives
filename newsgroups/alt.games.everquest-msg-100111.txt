    At level 10 my first character had never left the Innothule/South Ro
area, and had only ever grouped with other trolls and ogres. Now I will
admit this was pre-Kunark, so there weren't as many twinks as there are now,
but really: how the hell would I have known what the different classes
looked like? As far as I knew at that level, everyone wore leather or was
naked regardless of class. I didn't know what casters looked like until I
made Delores and started seeing them kiting my people all over Butcherblock.
Knowing someone's class based on appearance is something that takes time.
And it's not like the /who command would help identify the class of the
average port-capable character.
