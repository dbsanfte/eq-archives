Don't have much of my original words quoted here so I'm not sure exactly
what the context is (we are talking spiderling silks?? not spider silks?),
but the drop rate was nerfed; I know a few areas where it wasn't nerfed and
just go there instead now. The difference is between getting stacks of
spiderling silks in the right zone/s and getting a stack or less and a bunch
of useless things like pristine silk, black silk etc etc. If you want to
know the old drop rate try the xakra wormies near shar vahl; the silk is
almost interchangeable and drops far more than in the nerfed zones.
