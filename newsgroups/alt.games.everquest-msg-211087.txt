    There used to be a lot of nasty bugs with charms. My favourite went like
this: charmed pet is attacking a mob. The owner of the charmed pet Gates or
otherwise leaves the zone. The charmed pet stops fighting, but still has the
"attack mob y" command on it. The moment the next person comes along and
charms the former pet, it goes tearing off after the last thing it was
fighting. This was really amusing the first time I saw it happen in CoD,
where the "former pet" was at the front of the undead area and the mob it
went after was towards the back of the undead area.
