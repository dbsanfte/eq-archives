Tools available to the soloing Clerics:

Ward of Vengeance (405 defensive proc,no its not a DS,can crit)
Summoned Hammer,26/18 vs.Undead,not to mention the "godly" proc.
Summoned hammer pet.
Clarity potions (I use the 18p version)
Haste  potions (again I dont use the most expensive one)
Very efficient heals over time.
Desolate Undead (Nuke,310 mana before SCM and focus kicks in,
                                   ,unresistable,can crit)
Turn Undead  (1200 free damage every 3 minutes,AA ability)
Divine Avatar  (well,too bad its only usable every 36m for 3m,heals
for 200 a tick,increased procrate and melee damage.)
Pacify ??? (I dont want singles :)   )

To sum it up:
Use what you got wisely and NO DOWNTIME occurs vs. low dark blue
mobs.
As I mentioned soemwhere else here,I can make an AA every 2 hours
in Chardok B or Veksar,and compared to a lot of Clerics I am kind of
under-equippped for nowadays standards,caused by playing 2 mains
simultanously,of course I have all Focus effects and FT I can get at
my level.

I dont know what you expect for Wizards,shall they be allowed to
chain nuke all day or what ?
