So if PC 1 gets charmed by an NPC but is killed by PC 2, does PC 1 lose XP?
My guess would be no, since you sort of become an NPC at that point.

Also, I don't understand how an enchanter can charm you *AND* have a pet.
That's two pets!  I wonder if that's a special ability that only NPCs have.
Or maybe two enchanter NPCs were fighting and you became the weapon of one
of the NPC enchanters.
