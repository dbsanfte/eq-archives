I'll have to play around with this some and see if I can get used to it. 
  I've got 5 years of inertia, including 57 levels of bard in first 
person if you can believe that, to fight.

Using a hotkey to go to a specific different view and another to go back 
to first person would be a much better solution than running quickly 
thru the various f9's.  Course thats two hotkey slots gone, and I 
generally have em all filled up.

Can I lock one of the views to be centered on me from the front, so I'm 
looking straight back when I hit it?  Or is it going to be looking at me 
from a fixed angle when activated, and I'll have to swing it around 
manually while running like mad?

I stop running and spin around using the arrow keys, spin back around 
and move forward using arrow keys, usually doing so when rounding a 
corner so I have to turn anyway, so I'm just turning a bit further, and 
only turning back partway; that depends on geometry of the pull of 
course.  If the pull is happening close to the group, I wait till I get 
to them and then turn around and watch incoming, throwing axes while I do.

Rarely get whacked doing this, of course I'm generally pulling from a 
substantial distance (125 or so) and either have a lead due to travel 
time of thrown axe, or due to having snared my target.  In situations 
where I've had to pull from much closer, I can usually "hear" the aggro 
messages of the adds, and click one per message as a rough estimate 
without looking behind me to see.

None of this is up to raid puller standards, I know, but Berserk isnt' 
really a puller class anyway, I just need to get as good as I can at 
this for the purposes of pulling for randomly assembled exp groups which 
may lack a real puller (seems to be most of them, actually)
