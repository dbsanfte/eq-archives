I'm still on the fence on this one. Perhaps EQ's biggest draw for me is 
the tactical nature of the gameplay. It always bugs me when a group has 
multiple tanks that ping pong aggro or multiple healers that just kind of 
fly by the seat of their pants, healing everyone without any sort of plan 
(often resulting in wasted mana as multiple heals hit the same player at 
the same time).

I have no inclination to shoot for certain group compositions, I just 
prefer a clear role structure, probably because it's the most efficient, 
therefore the most powerful. One healer healing one tank. The backup 
healers and tanks step up when the primaries dictate, otherwise 
concentrating on DPS and other group utility.

EQ2 is apparently taking the approach of eliminating the situation where 
certain classes are more crucial than others (a very good idea, IMO), but 
I worry that it may be at the cost of dilluting them too much. 

Does the fact that there are fewer archetypes work well in this regard? 

Does it ever seem like too many in the group can pretty much do most 
everything that too many of the others can?

Is there enough difference between the various classes of a particular 
archetype to give one any more value in certain circumstances than the 
others?
