Just thought I'd comment on the Druid + Melee thing.  I run 2 accounts at
once and have a 55 Warrior on one and 53 Druid on the other.  Both have
decent but not Uber equipment, ie Planaar stuff but not SOV armour.  Despite
pretty decent weapons on my warrior ( Frostblade, Runed Sword of Morning) I
have not been able to duo much at all with this combo since the high 40s
without excessive risk or downtime.  I think a shamy or cleric with the
warrior would have been far more efrfective because of the ability to
haste/slow or alternatively heal better than the druid.

If anyone has any suggestions where such a Duo could do well I'd appeciate
advice.
