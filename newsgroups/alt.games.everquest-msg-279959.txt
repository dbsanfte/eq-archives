Sure if you get gimped through everything by high level players its easy 
as pie. Trying to actually earn your progression is a nightmare that's 
actually been exacerbated by how easy its gotten to just get gimped 
through if you know the right people.

Sacrificing "friends" to join a new group of people focussed on 
"similiar goals" whom you'll eventually make "friends" with is still a 
sacrifice. Especially if its "RL friends who also play EQ" you are 
sacrificing in exchange for "online-only everquest fixated facsimilies".

/shrug you ran your guilds as you saw fit I'm sure. There are plenty of 
reasons to xfer servers... its been over FIVE years now. 2 server 
transfers in 5 years doesn't scream personality problem to me. It bears 
looking into, but at this stage of the game its not even THAT unusual. 
Especially as many people change servers to hookup with RL friends.

As I said to Graeme, I feel the current backflagging process actually 
harms legitimate raid progression of guilds who haven't already gotten 
past it. Its easier to get high level friends to now effectively gimp 
you're entire guild through -- they only have to gimp a small critical 
mass through before they can start gimping their own members. This is 
proving to be easier and more efficient than doing raid progression.

While I'm not upset that theres an alternate flagging in place, I'm 
disgusted by what its doing to "guild building and pride" in lower end 
guilds.
