Shaman now have Velium Strike, 925 for 300 mana, a 3.08 ratio compared to
the previous one 675 for 250, a 2.7 ratio, a 14% improvement in efficiency,
and a 37% improvement in damage.  It is a level 64 spell, compared to a
level 54 (Ice Strike).  Also get some new poison DD spells that are close to
on a par with Ice Strike.
