I probably didn't put that quite how I intended. Let's try it this
way:

Question: When an NPC scores a successful attack upon your person,
does that, for lack of a better description, reset the delay of your
attack currently in progress?

For example:

Say, using a wurmy, you score a successful attack. The delay timer on
your weapon starts to count down again from 40 (assuming no haste to
simplify things). Halfway into that, at 20, the mob you're fighting
scores a hit. What I want to know is does this effectively interrupt
your current attack and set the delay timer back to 40 instead of
continuing on with 20 to go like nothing ever happened?

And before you say no....are you sure? Have you ever watched yourself
in anything other that first person mode? I'm not saying the graphical
representation has anything to do with what really happens but you
stagger when hit by a mob, you don't continue on with your original
attack unimpeded. The same for NPC's. They get hit, they stagger,
their current attack stops, they attack again.
