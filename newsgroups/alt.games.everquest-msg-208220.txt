I agree with most of what you said, except for "I've very rarely gotten
burned on NBG".  If you qualified that with "that I became aware of" I could
accept it.  :)

Even with myself, though I much prefer just full random (with some common
sense thrown in if a no-drop item drops), I have screwed people in NBG.  It
wasn't even intentional.  Just an example from way back when, I was in a
pickup group in Sebilis and some stick dropped that only I could use. 
Nobody asked my preference, and I was solely there for experience, but they
handed it to me.  I looted a tranquil staff the very next day.  I screwed
five people out of the chance to twink or sell that weapon which was going
for 8 to 10k at the time.  Unintentionally no doubt, but that made it all
that much more clear to me how flawed the "need before greed" system is.
