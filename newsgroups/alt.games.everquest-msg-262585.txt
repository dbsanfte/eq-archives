I look forward to the one you describe.  It sounds creative.

I have to ask, do the monks die in one round and the wizards run around like
madmen if they get hit?  Just trying to find out how realistic it is.  =)

The one that raises the stat cap is an interesting idea too.  I have to say,
both from my personal experience so far and from seeing things like this,
OoW is a complete turnaround from GoD, which I didn't care for at all.  Of
course, if levels had bumped to 70 with GoD, I might have liked it more.  It
was rough on even fairly well equipped 65s.

I'm sure there will be downsides, such as the trials you mentioned.  My
guild didn't have a high enough average equipment level to send just random
people through the Ikkinz trials and hope to win.  We had to stack the group
(sadly, that even included stacking me, one of the better equipped in the
guild but "only a monk", out of the group, and sending in my twink cleric
instead).
