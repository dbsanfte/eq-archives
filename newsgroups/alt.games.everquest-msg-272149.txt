That only can work when all resources are interchangeable.  They aren't.
Say you've got a bug in the server's calculation of mob aggro.  You can't
assign a character model animator to fix it.

In fact, not only does expansion work probably not take away from bug
fixing, it probably actually helps it, as the expansion team is probably
asking to have many bugs fixed.  E.g., to continue with the previous
example, if there was a server bug in mob aggro, someone designing new
encounters for an expansion is likely to be complaining in his status
reports that he can't finish designing the encounters because the aggro is
not being handles according to spec.

No one wants a perfectly working game more than the people who are trying to
use it as the basis for their expansion work.
