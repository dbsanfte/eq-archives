Grabbed my SMR, finally. Took me a good part of my life that I'll never get
back, but I finally got the damn thing. I figure I'll turn it in after I get
the rest of my bottleneck pieces, then I don't have to part with their
purplish beauty.

As for MR nerf, they changed the -50 adjust on CoD to 0, then -20, and now
that's what I hear it's going to be. Also, I heard rumours that some of the
high-resist mobs (IE, the spiders in PoN) are going to be adjusted to make
it a bit more reasonable now that the modifier's been sliced into 2/5ths
what it was.

Glad to hear the battle plans are ready. My guild's hitting the Hole next
Saturday (not upcoming one, but one after that) and I'm hoping to hit the
Ghost of Kindle while we're there so I can grab my epic piece.
