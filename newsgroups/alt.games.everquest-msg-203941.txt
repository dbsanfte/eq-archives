You _must_ know better than that Foo.  Soon you will be dubious to
most of the North Freeport Paladins (those from the Hall of Truth)
which will give you access to the banker in NFP (via the "secret"

Bard guildhall and the Temple of Marr (Paladins on different faction).

Order faction hit for years now.  I imagine you'd have to kill an
awful lot of Orcs, but it could be done.
