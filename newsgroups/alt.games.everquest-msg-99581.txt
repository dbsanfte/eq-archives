I'm guessing Hate and Fear (and a few other zones) will need rebalancing
soon anyway... when you start to get more people with maxxed-out AA
abilities, and with the changes to improve casting classes.

Verant prolly learned their lesson with the post-Kunark/Velious shift
towards the melee classes... you can't just dump more pwerful equipment into
the game without compensating the classes that aren't equipment-driven.

Just look at PvP... a nekkid Wiz can still cast his top nuke (albeit less of
them)... but a nekkid melee is just target practice.
Whereas, on a blue server, a fully tooled up Warrior can now do a lot more
things without Caster support than he could pre-Kunark... simply because
he's now got more powerful equipment to play with.

No... the question he answered was specific enough to rule that out... he
was asked about the level cap moving above 60.
