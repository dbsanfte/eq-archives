It should be noted for those considering buying the game that the highest 
graphics settings come right out and tell you that they will likely 
render the game all but unplayable on even the top-end machines today. 
They have built in plenty of room to grow.

I play the game on the balanced setting. The only thing I notice missing 
is the ground flora. I did turn that on specifically last night with no 
significant performance degradation.
