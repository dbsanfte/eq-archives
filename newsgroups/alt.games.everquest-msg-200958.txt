Basically there are several mechanics here

1.  The xp to get through a level is

Lever^3 * 1000 * Racial_Penalty

which gives us the xp to get from level N-1 to N as

(N^3*1000*RP) - ((N-1)^3*1000*RP)

2.  The base XP of a mob is

Mob_Level^2 * ZEM

Where ZEM is the Zone Experience Modifier, which ranges
from 75 in many old world outdoor zones to 145 in PoN,
up to some ungodly number in the elemental planes (it's
been calculated at 240.  These are the current numbers,
PoP ZEM's are being reduced on Test, but those changes
aren't live yet.

3.  The base XP is then multiplied by a group bonus -
currently this is
2 people - 1.02
3 people - 1.06
4 people - 1.10
5 people - 1.14
6 people - 1.20

This is also different on test right now, but not live

4.  The XP is then split, where everyone gets

(Player_Level+5)/(Sum_Of_Player_Levels+(5*Group_Size))

as a percentage.

5.  For each player, their cut is further multiplied by
a bonus factor that increases as the mobs get closer to
your level or above.
