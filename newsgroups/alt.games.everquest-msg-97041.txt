Hiya, one for the ranger experts out there :)

I know that killing wolves and bears around surefall is a no go, but Ive
just made the trip across to Freeport. Should I also avoid killing kodiaks
over there as well?

Ive been doing Net searches, but cant seem to find a definite list of what a
ranger can and cannot kill in regards to faction effects.

Thanks

Pete
