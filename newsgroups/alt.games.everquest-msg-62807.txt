    At one point they didn't even set up healing chains. They actually
spam-healed through encounters, because they had the sheer numbers to do it.
Now that some of the clerics are beginning to cut back their playing time
they've firmed things up, though.

    Doesn't fly. If they have a Donal's BP chain in place and working, then
they never go OOM. Ever. They can be beating her regen by a paltry amount,
and as long as they don't get respawn they win.

    So you can do Vyemm with one cleric? No. As long as you have sufficient
healing, sufficient damage output, and control aggro, yeah sure, you don't
need Donal's BP. But if you don't have sufficient damage output for the
healing present, then the old pre-nerf Donal's would "patch over" your
deficiency.

    It illustrates exactly what I'm talking about, is what. Standard
two-player team doesn't have enough damage output to kill Lodizal before the
healing runs out, no matter how well you control aggro on the turtle. Put a
warrior and a pre-nerf Donal's BP cleric in there, though, and Lodizal dies
because it is physically incapable of killing the warrior barring some
accident of lag or wandering adds. Now scale that up.

    That's an important point. The elder cleric on our top guild was most
excited about the SoL discipline that shortens casting time on spells over 4
seconds cast time. That'll tighten up the healing chains some, if they can
find the time to XP ever again.
