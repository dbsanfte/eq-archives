Yeah, I now have 3 toolbars full of tradeskill icons, split into
groups, with a space between them.  Now I just need to remember which
skills are for which trade..

And I also find it weird that there are a lot of overlaps.  There's
one button, looks like a blue cube, which seems to be almost universal
at increasing both quality AND time - I often get +5 +50 when using
it.  Handy after taking a few hits to quality.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
