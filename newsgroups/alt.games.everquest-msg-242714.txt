  Fixing it is a big job.

  Anyhoo, as I was going through it, I noticed in the grouping primer that
I stole from a post by Tyas gives good roles two class, cleric and
Paladins, play in a group.  This makes sense, since he was replying to
someone who was asking spefically about those two classes.  However, I
think that for sake of completeness it would be good to have similar write
ups for all the classes.  I can do this, but it would be a big job and I
wouldn't mind at all having some help.  So... help. Anyone?  Write up a
description of a class, in a format similar to this:

From the FAQ, lifted from a post by Tyas.

Cleric: Traditional duty: Healer/buffer. Other roles: Nuker, especially
against undead. For all that they wear plate they really cannot tank.
As a low level cleric you will spend most of your time with your rear end
on the ground, medding back that oh so precious mana. What you want to do:
Figure out what are your hp buffs. Those need to be cast on the main tank
(at your low level however, there may not be a well defined tank), and
anyone else that regularly takes hits. If you have the mana available to do
it the good way to do this is to cast it on yourself, then each other
character that is going to get it in turn. Then when yours starts blinking
you know everyone is about to lose their buff.
    Pay attention to everyone's hitpoints... When they get low, heal them.
Learn how much of the 'bar' your heals do on each player... it will be
different based on gear and class! Only 'top off' people's health during a
lull when you have full mana.

Paladin: Paladins can be a puller (the lull line helps them there, and stun
pulling gives you a head start back), and are designed to be a tank. With
heavy armor and lots of hitpoints, plus their own buffs and the ability to
heal themselves some, they make good tanks. Learn to love the 'taunt'
button.  Depending on what you are fighting and how things are going, you
may be spot healing yourself, stunning, or just using your mana for
pulling. Lay on hands is your 'fix me now!' key, and  also good when the
wizard gets agro and is folding like wet cardboard. You can be a pocket
healer if necessary, but there are several better alternatives out there.
Still it's better than Mr. Monk can do for others.
   Basically in most groups your job will be to go get things for people to
kill, attack targets, try to maintain agro so you bleed the most, and spend
your mana reasonably (If you're not using any of it you're not using your
class to it's fullest.) Note do not just step in and try to take over agro
if you join an existing group with an existing tank. Figure out which one
will be bleeding the most... the other should generally not taunt, though
stunning, etc is useful.
