hi,

i'm sure everyone has experienced the bug that prevents casting spells,
changing spells, et cetera, but the other night i experienced the same thing
for melee

i was pulling, had about 3, tried to attack them, but nothing happened...i
had my weapon equipped, had the correct mob targetted, was within normal
melee range, was not slowed, the mob was not charmed (it also conned scowl),
it was in fact IN FRONT of me (sometimes mobs warp due to lag) and  **the
mob was hitting everyone except me**

i did not exist for this short time (long enough to kill a group, felt like
years, was probably a minute or a minute and a half)

i typed and told people that 'nothing was coming out'

i was not hit at all -- not at all -- even though i pulled all the mobs and
had plenty of aggro

and, as i said, i was not able to hit

eventually, after everyone in my group was dead and the mobs just stood
there staring at me, my attack worked (the light was blinking the whole
tiem, i didy press autoattack) and i killed 2, then died to the third

so...attack frozen, but i was also immune to attack (i HAD aggro then lost
it, on three mobs, to three different people, exactly as if i had just died
or feignd)

little help? anyone seen this before? i petitioned, but you know how that
goes (when i talk to the wall, sometimes my cat comes and sits on my
lap.../pet'ing is about that productive, often less)

thanks

confused
