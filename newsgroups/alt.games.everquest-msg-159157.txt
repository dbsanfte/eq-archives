We officer award any of the high end (for us) stuff that would improve
the guild's raid power. More common stuff we put up for /random by
anybody who still thinks it might be an upgrade, or /greed roll to sell
or twink if nobody wants it for use.

Spells.... ditto. If there's casters on the raid who need the spell they
either get it (if only one) or /random or decide between them which gets
it. If nobody on the raid needs it, into the guild bank it goes until
somebody claims it under our normal spell bank rules.

I got two of my 58/59 wizard spells in Juggs on the last Trak attempt
that way. Saved me a bundle in the bazaar, I can tell you.
