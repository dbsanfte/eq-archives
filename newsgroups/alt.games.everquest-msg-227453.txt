Anyone that wants to sit at a zone line, pull to a zone line, make a camp at
a zone line deserves everything they get, its like seeing people make Tents
at the entrance to a railway station, its damn rude, inappropriate and shows
a lack of any initiative to make a nice camp somewhere less busy.
 Yes announce your train and make every effort to do so, but don;t stand and
die so some slacker who;s sat on his ass at zone line can continue to watch
TV, listen to MP3's scratch his ass or whatever it is they were doing.
