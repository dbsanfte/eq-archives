	I just pulled up Lucy and ground the numbers...with the new DoT, a 48 SK
can stack four dots on a mob (Blood of Pain, Heart Flutter, Heat Blood,
Engulfing Darkness) for 784 damage over 72 seconds.  That's casting Blood of
Pain (the new one) twice, since it only runs 36 seconds.  It takes almost 14
seconds to do all that casting, so the SK in question would have to be pushing
over 55 DPS to outdamage that with melee output in that time.

	I currently have access to a 49 Ranger with a Lamentation/Centi LS and
Silver Chitin Hand Wraps; she pushes close to 30 DPS (parsed with a real-time
parser).  There is no fucking way a 48 SK is putting out more DPS than that
without a level of twinking that doesn't bear thinking about.
