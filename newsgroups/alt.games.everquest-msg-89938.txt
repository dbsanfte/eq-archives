Ah, reminds me of when some level 20 Halfling rogue got stuck there 6 months
ago.  My druid was logged on so I grouped with him and was about to port him
to GD when I thought to ask the stupid question "do you have the GD tooth?"
The answer was, of course, "uh, no."  Soooo I ported him to Iceclad and
since he's a member of a guild who are friends with ours I ran him all the
way back to GD and made damned sure he picked up the tooth before going to
Thurg.

I didn't realize until much later that simply ATTEMPTING to port him to GD
probably would have gotten him unstuck. :p
