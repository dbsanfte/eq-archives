    The whole tone of your post was bitter.  Bitter doesn't
necessarily mean wrong.  But people who are bitter about a
particular subject may tend to present a skewed argument 
about the topic.
    Yes, some people probably break up over EQ.  However, I
would think that these are in the vast minority, and that
these relationships were on shaky ground to begin with.  
You say pretty much the same thing in your replies, but in
a way that suggests that you have some reason to be upset 
with the topic.  Fair enough, I guess.  For sake of balance,
I offered myself as an example of how EQ can bring couples
closer.  I suspect, however, that for the majority of house-
holds, EQ is a neutral thing.  One plays, one doesn't, and
they just deal with it.  Doesn't mean I think you presented 
an incorrect scenario, but wanted to put out that the
introduction of EQ into a relationship doesn't automatically
seal its fate.

            turning into a flamefest, so will probably be
            dropping out of it.
