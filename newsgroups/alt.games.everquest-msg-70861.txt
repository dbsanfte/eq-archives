I did it solo.  I had to instant-gate items (1 for me and 1 for the wizard).
The porting wizard WAS argo'd and needed it.  Hate was only half spawned so
I had an easy time sneaking up to the nightstand.  Follow the Safehouse
instructions and it isn't so bad.  I have heard *cough* that they post a
link to Everquest Zone Explorer.  I have heard *cough* that this would allow
you to practice your run over and over in an unspawned hate using your
Tutorial.exe program. Not sure if this works *cough* but I suspect *cough*
that this works GREAT!.
