Yeah, I got mine a while back, but, now, I use mostly my 61+ DoTs, so 
it's fairly useless, and soon to be replaced.  I need to see about a BAIV 
item.

Poison DoT is the way to go if you want to get any halfway decent usage 
out of a DoT, the 65 one is just as good for that.

I often end up using my Poison Nuke, as I have the Scaled Avatar Gloves 
which saves me 20% mana on casting that one spell.  It's only 675 mana, 
but, it's damned cheap to cast, and recast time is not bad on it.
