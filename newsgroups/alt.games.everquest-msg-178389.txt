Ah, a real capitalist.  My enchanter expects no donations, and is quite
happy with the average donation of 25pp.  Have I been given more (yuppers),
will I take more (oh definately yuppers), do I expect more (no, and I think
people who do are sad (in a nice way, of course)).  If I set up and
/auctioned "Casting KEI for 100pp per person", then I would expect 100pp per
person.. but no one EVER does anything like that.  It's all about
'donations' and such.  And a 'donation' is what a person feels like
donating.  And as much as I feel about 'paying the chanter for their time',
on my other characters, I donate 25pp myself :), because after the first 100
casts, their time has been PAYED for.

This is for chanters who set up places and offer KEI.  If I'm running
through a dungeon somewhere and I have to run out of my way to KEI someone
(ok, I keep saying I, but this isn't really the case, cause.. well, if you
care, skip to the * at the end), I expect a little bigger donation.

*  So you looked, huh?  I've played the game for the however many years
(since a month after beta) because I love buffing people.  It's my
enjoyingment from the game.  Leveling is a secondary joy to me, and only
because I can then buff people better.  So when people don't "donate
enough", it doesn't bother me, I will frequently dual box my druid and
cleric and run around to those 'strange' zones and rez people, just for the
hell of it.  So I guess I'm not a good standard for 'should people donate
half their life savings to me for a click (yes, it's a click damn it) and a
minute of my time for waiting for that mana to regen.
