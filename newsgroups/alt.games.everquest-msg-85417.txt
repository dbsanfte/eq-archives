I don't get the same results as you for final mana total.

For you Wis druid I get 1689 mana, and for your Mana druid I get 1676 mana.

From wisdom of 255, you get 1579 mana at level 30, add 110 mana from gear.

From wisdom of 165, you get 1026 mana at level 30, add 650 mana from gear.

Please tell me where you get your values for the mana pool, of if I missed
something in the gear you listed for mana additions.  If my figures are
right, then you can see that at level 30, the wisdom is better.  Better yet,
dump the 10 extra wisdom, leaving yourself at 255 wisdom, and swap the back
and chest items for 125 more mana on the wisdom druid, giving a total of
1814 mana.  Seeing as wisdom is capped at 255 anyway, there is no point in
going higher on it.  I used the mana calculator at
http://eq.castersrealm.com/misc/manacalc/,  which, as I understand it, has
been updated for the new mana calculations after the wis/int caps were
changed.
