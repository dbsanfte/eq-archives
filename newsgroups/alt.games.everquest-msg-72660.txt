I happen to agree. Force Shock is a pain in the ass. sure it does 171 base
DD, but it resists all too often. I have tried using cancel magic on the
MoBs in LOIO but it doesnt help all that much. But with Luclin we got
another level 20 spell and thta is Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock. I believe
it is a 141 base DD, and as an added bonus it eats 30 points of mana less.
So this means you can get it off a couple more times than Force Shock. It
may do 30points less damage but i will trade the 30points of damage for 30
points of mana. Just my thoughts
