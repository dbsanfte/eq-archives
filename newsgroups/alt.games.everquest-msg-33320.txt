only real dissagreement I'd have is the gate/bind at same level. As an
enchanter most of my spells are upgrades as you go through levels. And I get
ALOT of upgrades *Grumbles about cost of dem spels* I personally consider
Bind Affinity to be an upgrade to Gate. As a magic caster you don't get all
your skills at once. That would be pointless and change game balance to
much. that'd be IMHO like getting breeze and clarity at level 16... Just
doesn't make sense to me... my .02c... thedesire to get those levels and the
fight to get there is what makes this game so kewl for me... the level 15
rush knowing I'd soon have breeze... just think... I get the same rush at
level 28 now heh... flame me for being newbie *Snicker* Rightfully so
probably... *Shrug*
