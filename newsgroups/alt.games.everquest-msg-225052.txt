Thats not really the question.  The question is whether the damage shield
generates aggro when the mob takes a swing and hits the tank (or in this
case ranger).  Is the tank / ranger credited with having done a hit for 25
damage?

Given the complexitiy of aggro, I've never seen a difinitive answer to that
one.
