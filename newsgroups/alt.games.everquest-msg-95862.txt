Wah wah wah

I love my druid & will continue to play her. Every class has it's foibles &
problems. Too expensive to be an Enchanter (the are only good for jeweling
anyway), Rangers are wussies, Warriors are meat shields, Paladins are for
misplaced roleplayers, Mages & Wizzies are too slow to level, Bards HAVE to
group, Clerics are just that CLERICS, Beastlords are weird rangers, Necros
are NO fun in a group, Shadowknights *see Paladin**, Monks do I have to
discuss monks? ---Did I leave anyone out? And can I start on the
deficiencies of each race now?

It's a game & you get out of it what you put in to it. I go to Norrath to
have fun. See you all on Drinal (do we want to complain about servers too?)
