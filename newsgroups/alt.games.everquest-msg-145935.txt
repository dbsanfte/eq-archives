Yes and he'd likely stay alive and get better exp that way. He wasn't saying
he was going to tell you how to play, only that he would waste his time in a
group like that. How would you like a Ranger to not melee but instead tell
you he is back up healing, if you don't like it, tough, don't go telling him
how to play his character.

Someones loss? Yes I'd say the group that got lumbered with a Cleric who
thinks he's now a melee.
