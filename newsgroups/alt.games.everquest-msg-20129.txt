You can even get the mask at an early level. I got mine at level 15, its
ok AC, great CHA, and the DE spell rocks (until you happen to have it on
near a guy who dont like DEs that is).
Use hide/sneak to get through Upper Guk. Head to Lower Guk. There you
need to swim through a tunnel, you NEED enduring breath if you will
hide/sneak through it. There is 2 mobs on the other side, so you cannot
go through it visible.
Then hide/sneak to the ASS/SUP room, and wait for someone to come there,
or see if anyone is camping it. Do NOT break your sneak/hide.

If anyone is there, or when anyone show up, ask nicely if you can loot
the mask, if they kill the ghoul that have it. Its nodrop and bard/rog
only, so if a warrior is down there killing he will 99% of the times let
you do it, since he cannot use or sell it.
Then wait untill the persons in the room kill the mob with it, ask again
if you can loot it, and head up again.
My biggest problem was getting up again, died one time, after shouting
for help for 2 hours *s*. But got up at last, and my rogue loved the
mask.
