I use the following for others (I have that on to
see how my pet's doing).

/hitsmode other m2 10 80 5 1 0 0 80

Where 
Other tells it to put others hits in the window
m2 is the mode ( not sure what it does really :))
10 is the X coord (left side of the box)
80 is the Y coord (top side of the box)
5 lines high
Chatfontsize 1 (middle size)
header = 0 (not on)
Background = 0 (transparent)
80 columns wide.

I moved it 80 down from the top of the screen 
to not overwrite the lag meter.
