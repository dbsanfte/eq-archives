No, you have to be a subscriber, which I already was.

I truly feel sorry for the people who subscribed just for a chance,
and didn't get in.  This is annoying, usually FP beta tests are
available to all subscribers.  I suppose EQ only wanted a set number
of new players at this stage...

I got lucky - I'd been online for 2 hours, hitting the 'Apply' button
every 2-3 mins.  THe Sat keys went in 4 mins, so if you actually wait
for the message, you're going to be too late.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
