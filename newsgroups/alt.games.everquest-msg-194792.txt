I have had same problem on Karana  server. Guide told me I was
probably too low a lvl to do quest ("my level has caused Ooglyn to
spawn multiple times?" plus i sucessfully did this part of the quest
as a lvl 42 shaman when i first started playing)

I petitoined 3 times but didnt get a response. Guess I'll restart the
epic from scratch at a later date (don't like runing my iksar around
Freeport/Qeynos invis needlessly though).
