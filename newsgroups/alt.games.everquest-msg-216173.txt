Ah, of course, I forgot.  No toon has ever been ebayed or inherited from a 
friend, because that would violate the eula.  And no monk was -ever- Pled 
to 50 with a fungi by a bored druid, I'm sure.  And all those clueless 
people you meet in pickup groups who say "what do you mean assist?" or 
"how do I roll on something? /roll doesn't work."  Are all just figments 
of my fevered imagination.  Silly me, I better go have a lie down 
somewhere.
