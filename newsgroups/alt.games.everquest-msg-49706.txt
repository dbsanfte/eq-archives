The subject is kinda controversial, but still, perhaps not impossible.

I'm a level 43 dorf cleric, with 200+ wis, 161 str, 770 atk unbuffed, and
can reach about 1750 HP and 810 AC self-buffed (only 174 defense yet). 

Recently I traded a bunch of stuff for a Dawnfire, a pretty cool 1hb that
procs 585 point anti-undead DD. Now I wonder, if I were to go solo, which
I'd like to try, to work on defense and other melee skills, then where
would be the place?

Lower Guk would be a logical choice, but the ghouls near the entrance are
green, and when going in deeper there's a chance of getting swarmed by 
casters and other stuff, since the ghoul froggies like to run. Perhaps 
someone could give a pointer for a good single-pulling spot down there?

Other stuff I've considered would be TOFS (too swarmy?), Kaesora (too 
low levels?), Burning Woods (too hard), Dreadlands (maybe?), Kaesora
(no idea), Oasis of Marr (hard to single-pull?).

Please submit your ideas. :)
