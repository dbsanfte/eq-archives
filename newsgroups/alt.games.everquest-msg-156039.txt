No matter how good you are at monking aka pulling you are going to get hit
the further you have to pull the more you are going to get hit. When you get
hit for 1100 (which has never happened to me yet) 3 maybe 4 blows and there
is 1 dead monk. I personally can't see how you survived 5 if you did. Also
when a mob makes a successful double attack roll you are going to get hit
twice. Heaven help you for a quad.
