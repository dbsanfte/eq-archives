Whoashit is a druid dragon meaning it'll have the highest level SoW on
him at all times along with root loaded (I wonder why they don't
wolfform...or treeform...that would suck actually now that I think
about it).  A high level bard will outrun Whoashit as long as he/she
doesn't get planted.

If you die, the simplest way to get your corpse back is to summon it.
