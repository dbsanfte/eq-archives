It's a raid, you guys don't post a raid schedule?  Your server doesn't
have a #taxi channel?  You guys don't have portmules for latecomers?
It's not like you really need invis that badly to get through SG at
55+.  Oh, and based on the past 14 months escorting various
guildmembers through various zones, I would have to say that there is
NO FREAKIN WAY that you're anywhere near as gimpy as a warrior when it
comes to travel.  At the very least you can bind in CS, start running,
and gate if you get in trouble.  Though why you would need to do that
is beyond me.

You're an uberguild cleric.  You have these nifty spells that make you
invunerable.  You probably have 1250AC unbuffed.  Any cleric that dies
running across SG at 55+ deserves that death.  You have to dodge one
bard tankable mob for about 3 feet until you hit the water, swim past
the 3 seahorses, who don't even aggro on 60s most of the time, and
then run past up to two slow, not especially tough, bard tankable mobs
on your way to the zone.  Is it a walk in the park?  No.  Is it
something that is trivial with DA?  Yes.

I assume when you say you let a monk check he runs in, gets hit, looks
for crush/slash/pierce messages and feigns, right?  I'm hearing now
that the preferred method for this is to now run a rogue with the AA
super-evade in there to do it instead.  Any idea why?
We're working on ST keys, not that they're really worth that much now,
but primal are nice enough to at least start going through the effort.
