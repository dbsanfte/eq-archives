Theres a great spot by the bone wall thats good for kiting. When you
zone in (with the zone wall to your back) head left along the wall.
Keep going till you hit the spinal bone looking wall. Just be careful
not to go between the swirly looking rocks (which heads into an area
with alot of nasty spiders). Not much on the way sees invis (con the
spiders on your way to be sure). Once at the bone wall, the corner
there is great for nothing natually wanders by there too close (unless
brought by someone). There are alot of goos and rats in the area. Dont
wander off too far from this corner (try to stay within the boundries
of the rivers). Once you snare a mob - pull it back to this little
corner and kite it around. Ive group hunted here alot in the past and
seems to be a popular area for kiting as well. Rats and goos wont
summon - but there may be an odd spider or two that wanders by that
might (its been quite a while since ive hunted there - so I could be
wrong). Good luck!
