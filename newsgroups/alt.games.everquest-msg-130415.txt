I watched a guy about a week ago who said he was soloing HGs in his
low 30s. His trick was to run out and hit one, then run to the nearest
guards.  He stood back and watched until both guards and giant had
beat each other down, giving each, when needed,  a nudge here and
there, then when all were low, killed the guards then the giant.
About every 4th or 5th giant, he would have to run off and kill a
dozen or so bandits to repair the faction hit with the guards.  During
the evening, I watched him do this several times. He  certainly had
the system down.
