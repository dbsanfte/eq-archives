Monks do not recieve the ability to taunt. Only your ability to deal vast
amounts of damage will ever be able to "taunt" off the enemy.
Critical hits are reserved only for Straight Warriors. No others recieve that
special ability.
As per your question about the bags there is a thread in here that lists the
bags and their abilities. Maybe one of the enlightened my point this gentleman
in that direction. (I cant seem to find it)
