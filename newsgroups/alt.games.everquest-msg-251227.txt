Surely you can't be serious. Its not remotely circular.

Consider this classical scenario:

Four babies are born, 1 is healthy, 3 are terminal and are going to die 
shortly due to various organ failures. If we harvest the healthy baby we 
can save the terminal ones.

(For the sake of the scenario, its an assumption that the medical 
procedures are certainties, and similiarly, we're going to eliminate the 
availability of other options to force the dilemma.)

So, do we kill the healthy baby and harvest her organs? Or let her live, 
and allow the three terminal cases to die.

An application of the moral principle of utility says kill her and 
harvest the organs, because it has the least cost in lives.

Like many, I find that s categorically unacceptable position.

Thus, i consider other moral principles such the sanctity of life which 
says no; it holds that it is wrong to kill, period. That the would-be 
victim is completely innocent strengthens that position as the principle 
of justice chimes-in in agreement.

I choose to let the baby live, despite the higher cost in lives, and I 
hold that its the morally right thing to do too.

You may disagree with me, and argue for the utilitarian case. But that's 
not a world I'd want to live in...
