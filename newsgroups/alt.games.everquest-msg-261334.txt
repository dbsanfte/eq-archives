I bought my current system because Luclin obsoleted my old one.  It
is because I occasionally visit Luclin zones other than Nexus/Bazaar,
(and also Jaggedpine) that I run with all new models off.  It sucks
so bad in those zones it destroys the fun of playing.  Old world,
Kunark, PoP, and all of the "free" zones added _except_ Jaggedpine
are fine on my system with any models/settings.

But that's only a part of why Luclin sucks donkey balls, maybe 10%.
The other 90% is the (mostly) horseshit content.  AFAICT, Luclin was
designed with the explicit intent of adding pointless misery to EQ
gameplay.  You won't get any kind words from me about any part of
Luclin, the expansion _or_ its release, because as a whole it's such
a POS that it doesn't deserve to have anything good said about it.
