Doesn't look any different. Why would it? The graphics engine that EQ uses
is positively antiquidated, as far as such things go...

It does seem a little less laggy when all the finger-wigglers light up the
room, but since you can't see anything but the spell effects when that
happens, you'll still end up /showspelleffects off. Also, if you're
upgrading from a seriously underperforming video card, you may find that you
can now max out the clipping plane and play with all graphics effects on at
higher screen resolutions without losing performance - but those effects
won't *look* any better.

Upgraded from a Creative Labs Annihilator Pro to a  Hercules Prophet GeForce
3. Nice card (well the CLAP's a nice card too, actually), but it doesn't
make any difference for EQ. I play a lot of FPS games, which is where a card
like that has the potential to really shine.
