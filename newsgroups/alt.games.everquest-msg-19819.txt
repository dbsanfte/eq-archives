That's one downside.  Another is that there are a LOT of idiots in the 
Freeport bank lately hanging out in that narrow little hallway, or RIGHT 
in front of the !@#$!#@$ door.  Lately I always run into at LEAST one 
other barbarian repeatedly going "Guys - we can't get in or out when 
you're in the hallway.  Guys... hellooooooooo...."  If only there weren't 
a guard or five nearby....
