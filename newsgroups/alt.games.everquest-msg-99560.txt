Valien,

I clicked on the first link the day you posted and today when I click
on it I get a "404 Document Not Found" error.  Would you happen to
know where else I might be able to view this information?

FYI, I think your diagnosis is probably right on the money.  I
installed a couple driver versions trying to get EQ to run correctly
when I upgraded to Luclin.  I think uninstalling everything and
starting from the ground up is just what the doctor ordered.

Thank you very much.  = )
