Sometimes, when I cast, EQ locks up solid. A reboot (with power switch, no 
ctrl-alt-del will work) is the only fix.

This problem seems to occur when I Alt-# cast a spell(though not every 
time, maybe once in every 100-200 casts), and I think it has always been 
Alt-2, but since the only caster I play is a cleric and Spell 2 is 
Celestial Healing, that may be a statistical glitch :)

Anyone have any idea what could be wrong?
