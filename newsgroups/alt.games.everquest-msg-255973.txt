If you are in a guild you are stuck with the same assholes
and idiots every day.
Now what is better?
Seeing the same idiots every day or seeing different idiots
every day?  :)
Really,as sad as it is,my opinion of my fellow players
gets worse every day.Gave up on putting all the melees
who attack mob from the front on ignore list,I wouldnt find
a pickup group anymore.  
Glad I found a group of unguilded,competente players some
weeks ago,its fun doing places like Nadox or Torgiran,where
all the sheeps never go,despite the ingame hint when reaching
certain levels.
