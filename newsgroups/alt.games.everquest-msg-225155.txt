What the hell are you smoking?

If you think melees are outdamaging casters, I have three letters for you.
KEI.

In the 45's to 50's, it gives casters double the mana regen that they should
have, on a permanent basis.  And at the higher levels, KEI / VoQ, Bot9,
Beastlord mana regen, flowing thought up to 15, focus items, AA's, mounts
... Casters today have obscene mana regen and the post 60 spells to use it
effectively.

And no, Rogues don't need a frontal attack.  They already have one for the
extremely few situations where they have to be in front of a mob.

Twinking a melee, 100k pp of gear.   Twinking a caster, 40pp at your local
KEI whore.
