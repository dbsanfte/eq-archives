These are fine, my 26 Druid is still wearing some plain leather. You might want
to invest in a magic 1HB like a Velium Morningstar (around 15pp) so you can hit
the occasional wisp.

A mob's back has lower AC, so if you've got a tank holding aggro you can melee
from the back and you'll have a better chance of hitting. You might want to
Flame Lick the mob, as it's an AC debuff spell as well as a (weak) DoT, and that
helps everyone.

Get out of GFay/CB. Camo up, run to Steamfont and go kill things by the
windmills or the mino cave - just keep an eye out for the Kobold Missionary and
the Mino Hero. Or head west to Butcherblock and stay there for a while, or hop a
boat to Antonica. There's a huge world out there for you to explore with new
friends to meet, now's the time to start.
