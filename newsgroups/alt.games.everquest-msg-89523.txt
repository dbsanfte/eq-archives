I was thinking this myself, but I do have the cleric which can HP buff like
crazy and throw some greater heals, although I do lack the thorns/sow.  I am
not too concerned with just PLing as I like the skills to raise faster then
my levels.  Although I have considered making a 2nd cleric to help rez my
characters at will on the 1st account but I will just have to relay on my
guild and friends when needed =P  I recently read druid/necro combo is one
of the best in the game as I will try that out too.
