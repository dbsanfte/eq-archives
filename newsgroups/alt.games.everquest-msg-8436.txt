I have been wearing most of the same bronze armor I had at level 20
and I am now level 35.  [Paladin 35]

            I have made improvements to earrings and neck and my
weapon.   But when I look at the armor options,  I do not see a big
improvement in AC available.  It looks like fine steel is 1ac
better per item and rather expensive.  

           What do most players do at this point ?   Selectively
upgrade pieces of their armor as money and opportunity allow.
Do they look for pieces with the same AC and pluses to STR, DEX or
whatever there key attribut is?
