The free beer is quite a consolation.  Gotta say, Brell knows how to
keep his clerics happy.  Whenever I get morose about not having snare,
why I just drink another beer!

FUnny, I bring a druid along for much the same reasons!  And clerics
can solo but it is not the most efficient plan.  Cleric root is miles better
than druid root... but cleric snare... well no matter how much beer
I drink the mobs don't run any slower!

On the other hand, my bard charm solos very happily indeed.  Sucks
a bit now that he has to use mana to do it... mostly cause if he dies
its a loooooong time before he has mana again.
