Bah, what would be the purpose... Why would we try to hide from any 
discussion at all of one fo the great horrors of the last century?  Are we 
that ostrichian?

Actually, I think, if we trace back the original Nazi comment in this 
thread, it is possible (with only a little bit of stretching) to suggest 
that it involved a comparison.  I'm really too lazy to go google it 
myself, so feel free to use the 'nuh-uh!' defense here. :) I do think that 
in doing so we would be sticking obsessively to the letter of Godwin 
rather than the intent, but there it is.

}Honestly, shit for brains, if you don't want to see this thread
}anymore, killfile it. Don't start throwing stupid "laws" to try to
}bully us into stopping the discussion.

I was the one who invoked Godwin.  I meant it mainly as a joke.  I had no 
intention of stopping the thread... it's far too interesting, and 
therefore, probably unstoppable, really. :) I found it personally amusing 
that someone -had- managed to make a comparison (heck, even a mere 
mention!) involving Hitler where it was on-topic and appropriate, and 
furthered the discussion, rather than being a slanderous and childish way 
to attempt to shut up the opposition.  

So as far as Godwin's law is concerned, perhaps this is the exception that 
proves the rule. :)
