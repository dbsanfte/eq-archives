There was another animated one other than the Rankin/Bass version,
which only did THE HOBBIT and THE RETURN OF THE KING, done in 1978 by
none other than Ralph "Fritz the Cat" Bakshi.  The Bakshi version did
indeed get well into THE TWO TOWERS before it ended.

The Bakshi version is at http://us.imdb.com/Details?0077869

The Rankin/Bass versions are at http://us.imdb.com/Details?0077687 and
http://us.imdb.com/Details?0079802

I kinda like the Rankin/Bass versions myself, but that might only be
because they got John Huston to do the voice of Gandalf.
