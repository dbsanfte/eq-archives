Ah, OK, so you 'made it up' and it just so happened to fit in with your
argument ):oP

I haven't parsed it, but Copelands is looking like 35-45dps to 100%
fighting. Add it time to pull/split a mob, significant loss of dps if
you decided to try and slow it, loss of dps if you have to run after it.
Then factor in the time to heal back up to full after the fight by
bandaging and regen. Most L60 exp mobs have pretty decent ac, cept for
the ubiquitous shrooms, but then their procs don't really help a
warrior's dps do they.

Doesn't look quite so 'hot' for these warriors outsoloing equivalent
level druids now does it?
