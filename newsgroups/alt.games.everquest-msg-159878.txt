I've been clammoring for this since Febuary, and now it's here (the only
things left on my wish list now, are undoing the Half-Elf tradeskill nerf,
long hair for half elf chicks, and pally snare undead... oh, and mana burn
for warriors, rogues, and monks).  I don't think they should charge for
this, though.  Hell, even if it was free, I would think it would actually
lower the server overhead, since many of us who are logged in just to keep
up with the guild would use this instead.  One would think that this would
use far fewer resources than the Eq client.
