Yes they are hard but for raid parties? Not true. Most of the action in GoD
is group-based. All six of the GoD trials in Barindu are limited to
six-member groups, as are the first Ikkinz trials in Kod'Taz. There are a
few raid based events like the Smith Rondo quest and some of the later
Kod'Taz events, but the primary action you'll be experiencing in GoD trials
will be group-based.
