Well, my lag problems (along with unable to log in problems) were fixed
with the installation of new drivers. But I too am getting some crash to
desktop incidents now. Not enough to ruin the game totally, but annoying
none the less. Hardly *ever* happened to me before.

One particularly embarassing one was forming up a raid for our guild at
the pool outside the hole. We had a couple people go LD and had to wait
for them, while I was joking around in /ooc commenting on how we could
get moving if the people with the crap performing systems ever made it
back.

Of course, when I have the command /ooc "OK. Looks like we're set. Zone
in and group up at the entry!"  ... well, you can imagine what happened.
Swam into the Hole zone line and was looking at my desktop.

/em sighs, clearly disappointed.
