Zing is unneccessary unless your melees are gimp and have under 100 stamina,
over 100 the only downside to the yellow bar being empty is that you can't
jump.  (under 100 there's a slow effect)

Cleric was probably CHing far too soon for max efficiency, definitely was if
enchanter_02 was slowing (enc_01 was probably tashing on pull).

Unconventional pulling actually works very well in a lot of exp situations,
like the enchanter charm pulling in an overcrowded Sebilis, or the druid
pulling in Kedge (that would be me) because the warrior is a retard who
doesn't use arrows to pull (run up and smack it with his sword then run back
with 5 things beating him up).
