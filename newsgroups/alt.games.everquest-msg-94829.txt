Fortunately, I'm friends with enough Danes to know fully well that not 
all of them are so childishly symplistic in their views.

I'm a left-leaning liberal myself (although certainly not of the 
bleeding-heart variety), and I don't particularly like George W. Bush or 
his political views, but I don't have a problem with the way the 
aftermath of 9-11 has been handled. In fact, I think he has shown 
commendable restraint so far. And you can hardly argue that the people of 
Afghanistan have been so far the greatest beneficiaries of the war, being 
finally rid of what was one of the most evil regimes of the century 
(notice I'm not discussing here the part America played in the genesis of 
the Taliban regime, only the aftermath of 9-11).

Besides, given the unprecedented horror of the attacks in New York, I'm 
actually very pleasantly surprised there has been so very little of a 
backlash against Moslems in general in the U.S. In fact, polls seem to 
indicate people are *better* disposed towards Islam these days, perhaps 
because they have been forced into a better understanding of the issues.

I'm not an American, but I think you can hardly blame them if they base 
their international policies on what they perceive to be the best 
interests of the US, rather than what some Danish EQ players think of 
them.
