Everyone should be worried about the next expansion and if their current
computer will run it seeing that every expansion soe has put out ups the system
you need to run it.....

I for one am still a player altho ive been gone for 8 months but still have my
account they stopped giving out free stuff when they realized they could charge
for it all these things they are focused on is stuff they shouldve provided
free long ago.

EQ lore has changed theres a site that tells you of the original lore then how
the timeline changes and jumps

next expansion im sure will be centered around only getting exp if your grouped
since they made it clear they dont want anyone above lvl 10 to be able to do
anything solo. And face it once your time enabled theres nothing left to do...
oh except moan
