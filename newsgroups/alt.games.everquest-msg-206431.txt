Yes, that is exactly what is happening.  I'm not saying that it should 
or should not happen, but rather that people are a bit more sensitive to 
anything governments do with regards to the internet.  If it were on 
another type of import into the UK, the reaction would not stir up as 
much convsersation.  I'm just making the connection between the reaction 
to the tax and one of the underlying reasons the reaction.
