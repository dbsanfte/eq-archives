Hawk form is available to Mystics at 20. At 30 we get Beaver form (I kid you 
not) and at 35 we get snake form. All of these are cosmetic only but highly 
valuable in dungeons and other tight settings where that big bear ass is 
just too obtrusive for everyone in the party. I made myself a macro that 
cast Hawk form and then Ursine Elder (bear form, and has to be done in that 
order) which gave me the HUGE and substantial benefits of bear form without 
the big ass. I've since updated the macro to cast snake form and Ursine 
Oracle, but it's the same deal. I get the benefits of my bear form but the 
appearance of a snake.
