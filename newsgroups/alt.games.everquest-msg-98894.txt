There's really no need to go grubbing for freebie quest
containers any more, especially since you'd have to go
all over the place to get enough to fill your inventory,
and most of them hold only small or medium sized items
anyway.

World's best bank container: Trader's Satchel, for
sale in the Bazaar (on Luclin), 1.5p each, 10 slot,
holds "Giant" sized items.  Fill your bank with 'em.
They're not good for carrying, though, as they weigh
25.0 each.

World's best "carry" container:  Deluxe Toolboxes,
for sale in the gnome "pirate" igloos in Iceclad Ocean
(Velious), about 2p each.  10 slot, holds "Giant"
items, reasonable weight.
