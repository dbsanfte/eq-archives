Back when I played a bard I was pulling the house in Unrest (back when
Unrest was a popular zone with more than just druid powerlevelers) and
after 20 minutes or so of pulling I no longer had to go in the house to
pull, the mobs came to us. As we had quite a good group there that day,
the group loved it. Even other people's pulls would exit the house then
make a beeline for our group instead of theirs. Unrest was particularly
bad for this because at certain points along the wall, you could agro
the basement with a bard in the group and that usually led to a zone
clearing train of hags and other assorted nasties.
