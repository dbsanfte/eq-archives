No they're not.  90% of them are there to 'force' progression raiding.

You can argue for or against them but that's what they are designed to 
achieve.

The VT key not only had solo elements, but had elements from 
increasingly difficult raid targets which forced/encouraged your 
guild/raid group to get better and to improve their gear.

The PoP keyed zones are there to force/encourage your raid force to beat 
increasingly complex encounters which require better skills / gear / 
levels as you get further through.

Well, Kod`Taz I can understand, but PoTime doesn't have anything you can 
XP on.  In terms of keeping toons out of locked zones, once 85% of a 
raid force is keyed for locked zones in things like PoP they can gimp in 
anyone they want and give them whatever loot they want anyway, so your 
example doesn't work.

It doesn't really do either of those things.

In PoP the only zones you can't get in through single group activities 
or quests are,

the four elemental planes
plane of time
crypt of decay B (doable with a single group now, but not the point)
plane of nightmare B (doable with a single group now, but not the point)

Can't think of any others.  In the elemental planes, for a single casual 
group, there's virtually nothing to do, other than grind XP.  You need a 
few groups in the EP's to get any decent loot drops (or a group wearing 
gear beyond what drops anyway).

Most locked zones in the game have nothing to do inside them other than 
kill raid targets to open other locked zones.

Plane of Fire is the obvious exception where for whatever reason the XP 
from certain mobs (not all of them) is still, at 70, some of the best XP 
in the game.  That's not a consequence of it being a locked zone, it's 
just something Sony did which we may or may not agree with.

Kod`Taz was always a single group access zone (6 single group trials). 
If you couldn't beat the trials, you wouldn't be able to survive inside 
the zone.
