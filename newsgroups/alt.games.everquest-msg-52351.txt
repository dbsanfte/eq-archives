You seem to be falling into the same presumption made by Ed, and that is, if
someone doesn't want to play the game exactly the way you would play the
game then they aren't playing.

If I chose to spend twenty real world dollars on a couple of thousand
platinum pieces, then used those platinum pieces to outfit my character,
then took that character and ran around killing things with his new
equipment, making friends, exploring, socializing and having an all around
good time..... well, that's playing the game.  I haven't paid to avoid
playing.  I've paid to enhance my playing experience.

This scenario might particularly apply to a person who wants to start a new
character but is a veteran player.  He's already experienced the low end
game and would find the struggle to outfit his character in basic armor and
weapons to wield against fire beatles very boring.  You might suggest he
simply twink from his high level character, and I would agree with this
solution, except that this yields the same result, which is a
disproportionately outfitted low level character.  Also, the new character
might be on a new server so this person could play with his/her friends.

Certainly you are open minded enough to realize that another person might
get enjoyment out of some aspect of this game that you do not.

Best Regards
