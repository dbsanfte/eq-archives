Well, Rumble has posted here for a while now, it's a bit unfair to
call him a newbie. Although I agree that newbies too often jumps
into the pool without checking the depth or temperature. Or whether
the pool is in fact filled with water at all, even...

I used it for posting once, when my ISP's news server crapped out
on me and I needed my Usenet fix. Not too bad an experience, but
I'm glad I don't have to use it all the time...

The biggest problem I see with Google is that their threading seems
to be pretty badly broken. Whenever I do a search -> view thread, I
seem to get just 3-4 posts in what Google claims is a 20-30 posts
long thread.

So is this standard in the US now? Not getting a news account from
your ISP, I mean? That's pretty sad...

I think that he goes overboard on innocent posters a bit more often
than necessary, but he's still not in my killfile. It's worth it for
when he follows up to the deserving. Someone in this group, possibly
you, Lokari, said something like: "Sure he's an asshole, but he's
OUR asshole".

Waaaah, I've never been stalkerized! I want one too, dagnabbit!
I guess I gotta post a whole lot more and be more confrontational
to boot, sigh...
