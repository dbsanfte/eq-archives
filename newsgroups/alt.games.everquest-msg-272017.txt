Joy for all us soloers who work funny hours, prefer to roleplay, cannot find 
a group/guild, prefer a bigger challenge, like a steady pace or the myriad 
of different reasons it looks like we are being looked after.

Grouping can be fun and rewarding and a great way to make friends but it is 
good to see more recognition for soloers.

I am trying to do wailing cave quest and as I mention in another post I was 
easily killed in the second tactician room by three greys - guys I would get 
no xp from. I know they are quest end mobs but why are they grey when so 
tough?
