Logically, it shouldn't work, but indeed I have used those methods on three
twinks.

Sitting and medding while the fight is key to keeping your mana level high
and, as the poster "faned" pointed out, you have to pick a nice target and
location.  I might suggest that you start in Paludral Caverns near the
entrance to Hollowshade Moor.  There's a tunnel with those mini-underbulk
creatures and a shroom of some sort.  The mage is high enough to single pull
them and the lvl 24 pets can solo them no problem.  The shaman will probably
get more than a blue per kill whereas the same mobs outside of Paludral
would give much less experience.

The "Pet Assist" method might be the best cleanest method given the levels
involved.  By the time I was doing the "reclaim" trick, my mage was 50+ and
the mana cost of summoning the level 49 earth pet (200) is very economical
all things considered.

I'd probably give Air, Water, and Fire a try and see which works best in
terms of damage output and mitigation (via air pet stuns).  The Air pet
seems like it would be the best choice.   Since a mob will almost always
choose a PC over a pet as a target, your fire pet's DS won't come into play
often.  Give it a go and let us know the results.
