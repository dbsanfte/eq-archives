I would not recommend a necro/rogue duo to 2-box.  Works great with 2 people
controlling, but is an entirely different story with 1 person.

Fear kiting wouldn't be so hard... so you'd be fine until the necro is
almost catching up toe the rogues level.  Once necro is 60+ though, whole
thing goes out the window.  Necro will mainly agro kite - I would be VERY
impressed if you could keep a necro moving, applying dots, and keeping snare
on, while simultaneously keeping the rogue behind the mob, in melee range,
and backstabbing every time the button pops.

Now if there was a /stick command like in DAoC.... it'd be sweet!
