This is a folow-on to a recent post about asking for a C.S. ress.  Comments
and opinions here led me to conclude it would not be worth anyone's time to
ask for a CS ress ( zone didn't crash - Zone in/out point of JPF was trained
and my system couldn't handle the lag. Ah well.) so when I got back on I
verified the corpses still had ress-time on them, then asked a Vicar in the
zone for a ress for me and my partner.  At 52nd I kept my Lvl XP at a point
where I could die twice and not de-level before I switched over to 100% AA
(the merits of which can be debated later). The first death occured because
of drowning (idiot), and the second in JPF when trained ( idiot again), so
prior to the ress I'm at my '3rd strike' before I'm out of 52nd.  My partner
and I both received the 90% ress.  Here's the weired part:  after the ress
I'm still one death away from de-leveling. My partner also says he did not
see any move in his XP.  Since no one else here or in the message boards I
read is talking about this I don't think there is a ress problem, but I
don't know how else to explain it.  We both did a bug report and went out to
recoup the XP.
