One reason I like to see the numbers is that I can tell where I am likely to
get a group (and therefore which character to play) by the number of people
online, for example:

Logging on and see that there's 2000 people on... I can probably get in a
group in higher level places (for a newbie like me with only a 27th druid).

Log on and see there's 400 people on.. time to fire up the low level
character and kill caimen in the Oasis.
