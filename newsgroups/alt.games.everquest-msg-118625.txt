I don't know if Iksars start at maximum KoS, but all I did was collect
30-odd belts and get a wolf form.
As soon as I was dubious (no more), I started handing in the picks to
Hallard in Hallards Supplies (EFP) to repair the damage to North Freeport
faction that the belts incur. Then I handed over 20 pp (2gp at a time) to
Fabian in East Freeport - he's in a bar between the soulbinder and the
docks. This one gives all good factions including the Antonican Bards. The
Bard faction isn't necessary, but there are some bards in NFP that may see
you if you go wandering from the route to the bank.
In Qeynos there's a female bard who can hit in the 300's and is very aggro
to evil races (bad hair day or 'that' time of the month), so if you plan to
travel to Qeynos, this last faction fix helps. Great for getting the Qeynos
badge of honor, as all my chars have.

Hope it helps.
