The whole Tall vs. Shorts thing was resolved a while ago (I should know,
I started the thread asking about it. =) ) Anyways, it's just the
perspective that makes a Barbarian look like it's slower than a Gnome.
Running side by side, and naked, neither one is faster than the other.
Or is that what you meant, when you said that they SEEM to run slower?
