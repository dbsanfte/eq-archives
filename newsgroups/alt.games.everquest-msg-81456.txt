I'm a firm believer in unleashing bolts of righteous wrath to smite
the hopeless stupid. Unfortunately, I think I passed over the fine
line between righteous smiting and generalized nastiness as I tried to
find the right tone for my audience.

I think that Bizbee occasionally has the same problem. He unleashes a
lot of righteous wrath, but sometimes I see him as a bit hit-or-miss
with who he goes after for what. I think he puts a lot of good
information into the mix too, though. Still, I keep hoping that he
will mellow into a kinder, gentler Bizbee who saves his wrath for
those who have *really* earned it.
