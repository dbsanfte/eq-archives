Thousands of years, millions of years, billions of years.  All
completely meaningless lengths of time if life truly is eternal.

That is my argument when people say god can't exist because he
wouldn't allow misery to exist in the world.  (1) The amount of
misery you'll suffer is tiny compared to eternal life.  It's like
gently stubbing your toe on some chair and feeling a mild pain
for a fraction of a second.  (2) Perhaps feeling that misery is a
necessary ingredient in your "schooling".
