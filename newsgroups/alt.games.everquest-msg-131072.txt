I don't know if it's how anyone else does it and I don't do DL yet but any
shaman can pet kite mobs and use very little mana.  I start by turning off
pet taunt and make sure both me and my pet have SoW.  I then pull with
walking sleep (cheap manawise) and then DoT with scourge,  then I run in
circles until I have very strong aggro.  That's when I sic my doggie on him.
While I kite the mob my pet nips at his heels for mana free damage.  If the
Mob turns i hit him with winter's roar and the start running again.  I can
easily do dark blues with only a bub of mana.
