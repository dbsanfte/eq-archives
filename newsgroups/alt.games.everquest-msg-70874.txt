Better yet, take an add, that has aggroed on your group, noone has hit it
yet, root it.  When root breaks, who will it go after, if noone else has hit
it still?  The person it was beating on before, or the person who rooted it?
Barring other aggro factors, like sitting, very low health, etc.  Of course
Root adds aggro.
