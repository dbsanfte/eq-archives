Best I have been in?
1 Druid
5 Monks

We were 12 - 18 (me 14) in Warsiliks pulling giants at the fort.

Druid runs out, snares a lone giant, DoT giant, run back to group, sit
on other side and med. Giant approaches that nast Druid, passes
through a circle of monks. You hear a loud buzzing sound and giant
chips fly everywhere. Druid heals up the minimal damage and goes to
find a new victim. If Druid went LOM, the 18 monk went to pull.
The giants ranged from 18-23, and we never had a problem. We got wiped
once when at the end of combat a Goblin Battlemaster wandered in to
our camp spot and started cleaning up the yard trash, so to say.
However, this massively red bastard was below half health when we
fell.

I won the roll for the Forest Loop, too... ;-)
