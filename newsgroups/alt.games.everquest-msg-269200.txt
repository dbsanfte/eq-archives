I think this opinion is a result of your rather bizarre (to me) playing
style.  I've been 50/60/65/70 for the vast majority of my EQ playing time.
From reading your past posts here (cleric, bard, magician, berserker...  did
I miss any?), it appears you get to the highest level and think you're done. 
I get to the highest level and the fun part of the game is just beginning.
