Yup, that's right, similarly, if I chose to utter a series of
syllables that our society has chosen to recognize as insults against
you and your questionable ancestry, they're only offensive because
that is how society generally views the meaning of those words.

You can't shrug off societal interpretation as unimportant, because it
is, that is where the meaning of words originates, and thus the
significance of them.  

Similarly, society has decided that stealing from other people is not
acceptable, nor is killing other people to meet personal goals, etc.
It's not your place to say "well, that is not how I interpret
morality," because the decision isn't yours.

Barring all else, simple courtesy suggests that regardless of your
personal interpretation of the word, that you respect others
interpretation as well.  Remember when a former U.S. president drove
around Australia making a Peace sign out the window of his limo?
There that is roughly the equivalent of flipping the bird in the
States.  If he had known that, you can bet he would have respected
their local interpretation of the sign and not made it because it is
offensive to them.
