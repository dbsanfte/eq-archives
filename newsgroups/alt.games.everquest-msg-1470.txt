I finally laid hands on a copy after about a month of /auctioning for
it about 3 times an hour for 3-4 hours a day. It does exists, and does
seem to stack with other poison based DoTs (Venom stacks fine so far),

BTW - I have seen comments that it might have a lower resist rate than
other poison DoTs. Anyone know for sure?
