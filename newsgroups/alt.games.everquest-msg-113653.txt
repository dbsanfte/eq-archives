> How do you go about setting up a profile on Magelo?

1. Go to: www.magelo.com/

2. Click on Register at the top.

3. After you've received your registration email, click
Login at the top.

4. After you've logged in, you will see new options on the
left side. Click on Characters.

5. Click Add a character and fill in the fields. (You will
need to know your character's naked base stats including AC
and ATK.) If you have access to web hosting (a free page
from your ISP or whatever), you can point your Background
URL to a screenshot of your character (or any picture on the
web really) by filling in that field. (Note that the Photo
URL field only shows the character's photo to you, not the
public.)

6. Once you've created the character, click on Manage his
profile(s) to create an equipment profile. Here you fill in
each body location with his gear, then click Save the
current profile to save it.

7. You can add inventory by clicking on Manage his inventory
and then filling in item names in the field and clicking
Proceed. (It's pretty finicky about typing the item name
_exactly_ as it appears in the game.)

8. Bind items to your profile inventory allows you to create
bags in your profile and dump some of your junk there for
public viewing.
