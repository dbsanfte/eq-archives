Sometimes getting a level makes you really happy.  And this is the only way (in
game) to express this happiness.

I soooo hate that.  I can understand if you're getting attack or something but
in general do not use those abbriviations.  They irk me.

Ja.

Ja.  Unless it was an accident.

Don't piss off anyone.  Period.

Well sometimes at the bank and in mass amounts of people you can accidently
inspect.  But personally I think they should get rid of the message that you're
being inspected, hell I don't care if anyone is looking at my "phat azz
lewt"...unless someone tries to buy something off of me because they saw it...

hoo hah!  I sooo agree.  some names are funny (bantha fodder, short stuff, etc)
but I mean really I saw a name tytytytytytytytytytyty and it made me want to
slap the guy.

Agree.  Begging is sooo stupid.  I think it should be banned. (except asking
for a sow or bind in exchange for plat, that should be taken to auction too)
