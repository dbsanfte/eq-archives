You're absolutely correct.  Whether I put time and mental power into bank
robbery or child molestation, I *deserve* to get vacations and other
benefits.

Fool thou art, and fool thou shalt remain.

You *DO NOT* deserve vacation or other benefits from tasks you perform.  If
so, then you deserve vacation benefits from taking vacations.

"Mike" gave his word not to sell the account.  "Mike" is selling the
account.  "Mike" is a liar and cannot be trusted.
