It does not have a deity restriction, unless it was added very recently.  
What level are you?  The club has a required level of 51, meaning you 
cannot equip it at a lower level than that.  As I recall, the message it 
gives specifies that it cannot be equipped by someone of your 
race/class/deity, not just deity, but, it's been some time since I have 
seen the message too.
