How did you get flagged?  Tag along on another guilds Aerin' Dar kill?
That would never happen on Tribunal.  Well I dont want to say never, but
the guild rivlaries seem pretty fierce and only two guilds on the server
have killed Aerin'Dar as it stands currently.  There is a quest to get
in there, but last I heard it doesnt work and its by no means easy in
the first place.

Its a big crock of shit if you ask me.  Mostly where spectral parchments
are concerned, but the loot/xp situation there as compared to everywhere
else in general bugs me.  Aerin' Dar is a tough encounter that only the
top two guilds on my server can overcome.  So not a lot of folks have
access to HoH but those that do get easy, fast xp, all the spectral
parchments they can handle, and DROPPABLE uber belts and a 2handed
weapon that is better than the pally and sk epic.  Nice going!  I mean
really, nice going.  Testing?  Whats that?

The spectral parchment drop rate there is such that people who have
access to it think nothing of trading a 63/64 spell they got from there
for a 61/62 spell.  Hello?  Verant, are you home?  Meanwhile the have
nots, 90+% of the 63+ population, struggle to get into the infernal
consort camp or go on futile expeditions to the caves of PoN (DOGSHIT XP
and loot) to maybe see one drop every four hours.

I think its too late to nerf this zone, but nothing will surprise me
where Verant is concerned.
