Such naivite... you erroneously presuppose that their goals are the
same as yours or anyone else's in the public.

Just a question: how much money do you think the Bushite's have made
with the oil prices being sky high right now, and with the increased
focus on the military? But that probably doesn't have anything to do
with it, right?

If you are swallowing the tripe they serve to provide their casus
belli, *you* are delusional. No credible link between Hussein and al
Qaeda has been found. No weapons of mass destruction has been found.
Read past the propoganda.

I meant threat to economic interests just like I said. The US has no
actual allies in the middle east, only puppets who would turn on them
in a second if they weren't getting fat off the benefits.

Ask yourself why the US supports Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and doesn't
support other arab states. Because of their democratic governments and
welfare of their citizens?

It's *all* about economics in that region.

Since no other benefit is gained from the actions, and there is no
evidence of any other interest in the middle east beyond economic
benefit (the lack of any progress on the abysmal "friendly" arab
nations human rights for example), why should anyone believe that this
is a humanitarian mission? Especially when we know it was being
planned before 9/11?

Very spooky words there. Are you listening to yourself?

What if Russia said it was going to start dealing with what it saw as
threats to its existance pre-emptively and then said it didnt feel the
need to ask or provide proof to anyone else?

Think that would go over well?

Have fun with the terrorist attacks for the next fifty years.
Personally, I think actually trying to stop them is a better idea than
getting more Americans killed for questionable gains is better, but
then I guess I like living Americans more than you do.

American peace, as in world peace enforced by the US under its terms.
That's not a happy thought.
