A roll is when each member of the group which took down the mob rolls a die
(in-game) to determine looting rights.  The command to use is "/random X".
Different guidelines get developed about what number "X"  should be.  Most
groups just use 100.  Others are more wary of risking hackers' influences
and the group leader may say "We'll roll random 477"

The results look something like:

Endurance rolls a die.  The result could have been anywhere from 1 to 100,
but it came up 98.
