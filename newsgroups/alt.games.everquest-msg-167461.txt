As with most EQ bugs, the solution is simple if draconian.  Log out, log
back in.  If that fails, Log out, reboot your computer, log back in.

Occaisionally the problem seems to be with your internet provider, I know
a danish friend of mine went several months at one point without being
able to use chat at all, ever. His ISP got some new equipment in and since
then its worked like a charm.
