> Can certain zone areas CAUSE interuptions?

When standing on the side of a hill it's possible to find spots where
you can't cast because you get interrupted every single time even when
standing perfectly still.  I've seen this happen in a number of
different zones.  It's a bug with being on the hill in that particular
spot I think.  If I move a few steps to one side I can almost always
cast just fine, even if I'm still on the hill.  

If pulling in very hilly areas I think levitate can help prevent
interrupts too.

Sounds like either a problem with the area you're standing in, as
mentioned above, or perhaps lag.  I get more interrupts when I'm using a
slow video card in a Kunark zone because of the lag.  In this case I
stop, turn a bit, wait another half second, cast, and make very sure I
don't move until after the casting time is done.  That usually takes
care of the problem.
