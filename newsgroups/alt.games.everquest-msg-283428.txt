I don't get where people are getting that either - things that weren't
introduced in expansions are likely to be available (no medding,
different spell progression etc. etc. et. al.)  It's a *progression*
server, not a *classic* server.  This is not going to be the EQ that
I started in late March of '99.  

But that still doesn't tell the entire story - the UI changed several
times, with the first big change being with Velious - I very much doubt
they're going back to the old UI.  Also, you bring up a good point - 
summonable focus items were introduced outside of an expansion, as were
the melee skills - but the focus item spells were purchased in the 
bazaar.  So, will they put the spells on old world vendors then?

I suppose time will tell.
