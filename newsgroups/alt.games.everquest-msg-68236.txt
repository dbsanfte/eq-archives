Possibly not, such creatures are basically not really meant to be
killed I'd guess. All of the seru guards I've killed are the same
way.. the stuff is low qual and those cool shields they have are
useable by my druid but are NO RENT and just ac so not really worth
the faction hits. I ran around with one for a big showing off to
people then tried to stick it on some other npc but it did not show on
them. The kitty shield is the cool looking one with a kitty face
right? possibly those are NONE NONE so they don't even have to load
them for players.

So far I've found no guard like normal  peaceful npcs in Luclin who
were worth killing at all for loot.

But there would be no point really since they are not good at the
level you'd get them.
