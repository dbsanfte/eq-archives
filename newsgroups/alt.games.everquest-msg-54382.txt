If you like soloing, EK is pretty good. Its not impossible to find a group
or partner there, but expect to solo. South of the bridge near reaver hill,
by the water shore, is a good place to pull to.

Oasis works well too, if its not too crowded... so it depends on what time
you play and what server a bit.
