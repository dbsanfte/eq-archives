The only time that may not be enough is when you arent close enough to
see the name, or like some mobs (eg rhino) the name is like inside the
mob...

At this rate it will get a big fat arrow pointing to its head or a
huge circle round its feet..... which you can see 3 zones over...

then they will end up doing something so the group mark a main assist,
and that then shows who they are pointing at ....

hehe
