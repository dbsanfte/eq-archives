Welcome to EverQuest!

 > Firstly, as a cleric should I be automatically healing/buffing any 
players I come across.

Only if you want to.  As a low-level cleric your heals and buffs are 
unlikely to be huge amount of help to most of the players you will meet, 
but I'm sure they would appreciate it.  You will find that a lot of 
people will stop to cast a few buffs on you, or heal you, especially as 
a newbie.  It is not 'expected' however, so you shouldn't feel that you 
are pissing people off by not going out of the way to give them free 
heals and buffs whenever they happen to run past you.

 > At some point I am assuming I will need to group to advance.

Yes.  It is possible to progress through the whole game without 
grouping, but it is MUCH harder.  Especially for a cleric.  At lower 
levels grouping is more about learning that it is about getting xp. 
Don't be worried about making mistakes, we all do.  Even at level 65 I 
still make mistakes now and then.  The important thing is that you learn 
from them and have fun!  It is just a game afterall.

 > How long would I be expected to commit to a group?

Totally up to you.  I have know people to join a group and then left 
again 5 minutes later, conversly I have known people who stay with the 
same group for ten or more hours.  It depends how much time you have to 
play.  If you are joining a group going in to one of the zones that 
comes with the expansion 'Lost Dungeons of Norrath' (commonly referred 
to as 'LDoN') then it is usually expected that you will stay with the 
group until the end of the adventure (anything up to 2 1/2 hours). 
However even then if you really have to leave, due to an RL emergency or 
something then people will usually understand.

Hope this helps!
