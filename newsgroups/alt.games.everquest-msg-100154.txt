Get the Ti200.  Yes, the 500 is faster, but so is the GF4 Ti4600.. and the
4400..etc.  I have a 500 and have everything cranked up.. with a decent
system, I see no reason you could not turn everything on with the 200.  If
the 200/500 thing is that big a deal, just OC the 200 to around 500 speeds.
May not get all the way there, but ballpark anyways.  The 200 is a great
QIII card as well, and assuming you keep playing FPS games that are released
new the card will hold up for a bit.  Along that line, as said, do NOT get
the GF4 MX card.  You are MUCH better off with, say, the Ti200 with, say,
the new DOOM or Planetside.
