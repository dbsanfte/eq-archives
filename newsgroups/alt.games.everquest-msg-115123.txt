The other day I was underground in Blackburrow, and I saw some players
walking against one of the walls.  After a few seconds, they disappeared
into the wall, like they walked through it.  Last week I watched a wolf walk
into one of the ice glaciers in Everfrost.
Was this a game glitch, or did I really see people walking into walls?

Thanks,

Connie
