If you rule out OOT and Shout, why include Gsay?  It shouldn't be
possible to communicate in a way thats 100% secure, like GSay is
(nobody will ever "overhear" you), nor should it be possible to
communicate across the entire zone, or worse from zone to zone
across the entire world, just because you are in a "group"

I'd think you'd prefer the current /say, plus /whisper (much
shorter range), and /yell (longer range, but annoying).  I
particularly like the way you can tell the direction to someone
who is /yelling, except that the range of yell is actually pretty
tiny.

Personally, I enjoy the game with the current communications
options... but man, I often wish the same options were available
to me IRL without having to get a megaphone, cell phone, speaker
phone, cone of silence etc...  Without any tinkered or spell
based explanation for the "better than real life" communications
system, though, it is a bit damaging to the suspension of
disbelief.
