I just discovered something interesting in Bazaar yesterday for you serious
traders. On my second account I logged in my Trader mule (Zakerhia) and set
up shop. Well at work during breaks I would pop in and check his inventory
to see how I was doing. Busy day in Bazaar and I did a search on Chest and I
notice he wasn't listed so I assumed he sold the Fungi and a Emerald Dragon
Scale Tunic. Checked some other things some were listed some were not. I
assumed he had a great day so did a Trader Search pulled his name up and it
showed for the most part everything he started with.
Did a search again on Chest items and sure enough he wasn't listed. After a
few tests my only conclusion is there is a limit on how many items can be
listed in each category sorted from A>Z
