Not seen this bought up yet so not sure if anyone else has had this. Since
the last real patch the weapons being wielded by my warrior are not updating
correctly.
EG. I Bow something to pull it and come back to either see myself swinging
with a Bow (that'd be a nice item, 34/46 proc smite 2hd Slash bow) or it
displays both my Sword and my bow.
Like I said, very minor just wondered if anyone else had this problem?
Obviously, when using 2 1hdr's the problem is not there as a the weapon off
hand gets displayed in place of the bow when I melee.
