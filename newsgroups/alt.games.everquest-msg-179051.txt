I hope that last remark was either ironic or has one negative too many...

Still, while I do agree that casters ought to chip in and join in the PH-
clearing, Druids are (after Enchanters and Wizards) one of the least-
capable classes when it comes to clearing hordes of green trash (at 
least below lvl 45 and the mana-free Drones of Doom from the ES 
Vambraces), considering that, unlike Shamen, after lvl 20 most of them 
don't even carry a weapon anymore.
