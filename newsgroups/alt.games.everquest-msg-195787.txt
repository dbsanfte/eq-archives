Go to burning woods and camp the giant fort. At 50 level  most of the 
giants will still give exp. In a few hours you can usaull fill your bags 
with weapons and armor to make a few hundred plat.
Im sure you can go to other place and get more plat and  there are easy 
kills that give no exp but, I think that making some cash and getting 
exp is the way to go.
