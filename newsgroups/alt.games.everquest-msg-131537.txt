}I suppose so.  I haven't done anything like this before, so I'm a little 
}hazy on how it works.  All I know is I'm sick of this:
}/say I'm so bored I'm playing gems. Yeesh.
}Groupmember_01 says "I have a second monitor. I'm viewing high elf porn 
}right now. Heh heh."
}(You get the idea)

Odds are, he's using a second computer.  It's -possible- he's got a second 
monitor hooked up, if hes has, I'd recommend grilling him to find out 
-exactly- what kind of video card he's using, if he had any weird snafous 
setting it up, etc.  It's doable.  What you need is a dual-head video 
card.  You might already have one.  The giveaway would be if you look 
where your monitor cable connects to the computer, if there's another port 
exactly like the one the cable's connected to right next to it, it's 
-probably- a dual head card.  The surefire way to tell, though, is to find 
out what exact model of card you have and ask the company that made it, 
either by visiting their website or actually phoning them up.  They have a 
tendency to as for numbers printed in little teeny script on the back of 
the video card when you do that, though, so take your card out and copy 
every stinking number off it before you call.

Even then, though, Running two monitors off the same card would definitely 
count as Doing Something Clever.  And EQ seems to have a fondness for 
behaving unreliably and creating problems if you Do Something Clever.  So 
it's entirely possible you'd get the second monitor, hook it up, do 
everything right, and have the monitor go completely black, turn off, spin 
around and explode or whatever when you load up EQ.

Sticking in a second card and running the monitor off a second card is 
also probably Clever.  The only way to be really sure it'll work is to 
find someone else who's done it, find out exactly what card(s) they use, 
and go buy those cards.  Which could be pricey.

}> IMHO, if you plan to have the other active so you can do things while in EQ
}> then remember that EQ is a memory hog, so you'd be able to do little CPU or
}> Internet intensive.
}Not much.  Look up stuff in Allakhazams so I don't get scammed in EC so 
}much.  Read an online book while I'm camping something.  Type a letter 
}to a friend while I'm waiting for a spot in a group to open up (HHK 
}needs to be about, oh, 7 times as big)

All of those things, on the other hand, sound like things that don't 
require an impressive, EQ-optimized, luclin compatible computer.  Remember 
back when luclin came out, and you upgraded every third piece of your 
computer and threw all the spare parts in a box that you stuck in a 
disused lavatory in the basement with a sign on the door saying, "Beware 
of the Leopard"?  It's time to face the leopard.  Go get those parts, take 
stock, and see what else you need to build a second computer.  Odds are 
high that with an ATX case ($30-50), a cheapass VGA monitor ($30-50), and 
a couple other things, you can have a second computer.  Or you could ask a 
friend if they have any spare parts floating about that might go with your 
parts.  Or you can check local swap groups and flea markets.  Nothing 
you've listed requires much more than a Pentium 233MMX.  You could 
probably do it with less than that even, but Allakhazam's may be 
insufferably slow. :)

And then, once you've done all that, and you're camping 
Never_Spawning_Mob_001 and reading a.g.e at the same time, you'll start 
realizing that all you gotta do is upgrade machine #2 a little bit and you 
can dual box... :)
