   I have a very similar problem.  Teapray is an old, if not particularly high
leveled character.  And it seems that she's on ALOT of friends lists.  Fairly
often I'll get tells out of the blue like "Hi, how you doing?  Just wanted to
see how you were."  They generally speaking aren't trying to ease into a rez
request or anything, they're just dropping a line.  And invariably, I'll have no
idea who they are.  I'm getting pretty good at noncommittal type banter.

   It isn't getting any better.  Often after I finish a LDoN, I'll hear a couple
people announce that I'm now on their friend list.  Great.  More people to
confuse me.

   My friend list is very short.  Splendid, and cleric named Laughter who I
actually think of as a friend even though I never grouped with and only met him
once.  Raz, Splendid's RL friend was, but then my list got wiped during a recent
"Don't let Tea log on unless she deletes all her .ini files" fit my computer
through.

   I figure that if you're _really_ my friend, I should know who you are.
