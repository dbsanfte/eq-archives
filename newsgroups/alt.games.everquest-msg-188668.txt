Well, I'd like to get it back, but since I'm just about the most ardent 
supporter of naming convention enforcement, it'd be rather hypocritical 
of me to take the issue up to a GM. If the name is released naturally, 
great, if not, so be it. As for Parsifal, it's indeed an alternative 
spelling of Percival, as used by Richard Wagner in his opera:
