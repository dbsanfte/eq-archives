I'd give the same advice to any newbie:

Loot EVERYTHING...loot other kills if it's obvious the person is a twink and
just killing stuff for xp.

After making a couple gold, buy a bag so that you have to make fewer trips
in.
Keep your eye out for any orc/goblin/sarnak/gnoll in your newbie area
because they can drop containers.
Keep your eye out for skeletons because they can drop weapons (vendor loot
for the most part)

BONE CHIPS!!!! No matter WHAT class you play, NEVER EVER sell bone chips to
vendors when players will pay at least 1g each!  Bone chips are the ONLY
spell reagent (err maybe snake skins too?) that you cannot buy from a vendor
in limitless numbers.

If people are buying weird things like belts & such, find out WHY before
selling them.  I know that at least for the Crushbone belt quest the person
who turns them in gets cash, an item and EXPERIENCE, and those three add up
(in my opinion) to more than 1p each.  There's probably examples like this
in most newbie areas.
