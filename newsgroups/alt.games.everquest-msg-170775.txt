I was playing around with charm around Sanctus Seru last night
and got some odd results.

First time, I was IN Sanctus, charming the two guards near the MS
line when I got an Optic add.  My pet near death, I zoned out,
figuring I'd come back in and find my former pet nearly dead,
kill him for the exp and then flee again if the Optic was still
near (pesky thing summons, even though she's blue to 50).  Well I
came back in and my pet was dead and gone!

Shrugging this off, I did some more playing around, when the
second oddity occured.  This time I was working the two guards
outside SS in Dawnshroud, and zoned early on after getting a
beating (pet wasn't having any luck pulling the victim off me).
I zoned back out (after all, I'm not KOS) to see if I could get
things going again... to find them duking it out!  Neither was my
pet, but they were having a knock down drag out fist fight for my
entertainment.  I appreciatively slapped a lute in hand and
played healsong while I waited for them to get hurt real bad.
When one finally broke to run, I mezed his buddy, chanted him to
death, then chant kited the other guy down (didn't remember to
put drum back in hand till I'd been working the second for a bit)

So looking back, I think I saw two instances in a row where I
charmed a mob, got him tangled up with a buddy or two, zoned, and
they kept fighting.  First time, the buddies finished him off
before I came back, second time they were still fighting.. but
either way sure was odd.
