    There's at least two missions (rescue and boss assassination) which
aren't all about DPS. Especially as more annotated maps become available, so
people know when they step into such a mission exactly where to head for the
target NPC. I do agree with you on the collection and "kill X mobs"
missions, though.

    The zones I've been in have required skill to play in. Mobs have a wide
variety of abilities (not just all melees or all casters of one type like in
the past), and pulls are usually multiples. You also have to have good mana
management skills, as constant movement means less med time. What the
binding and porting has done is get rid of the downtime associated with
adventuring. Really, is the challenge in EQ supposed to be running across
West Karana and finding a bind in Qeynos, or figuring out how to break a
room with a druid, wizard, and warrior NPC in it? Which would you rather
spend your time doing when you play?

    Our raiding guild can't get enough of it, and we haven't even touched a
raid yet. Heck, we've just started doing the "Hard" adventures, as we wanted
to pile up the points and get our spells / proc augments before we
challenged ourselves. The fact that the points rewards are very good and
very attainable for characters that couldn't otherwise get gear of that
quality will keep people playing for quite some time, I think.

    What made it great was the immersiveness and the gameplay. Those are
back with LDoN. No PLing in the spot you wanted. No farmers taking all the
nameds. No stupid ooc banter, camp checks, or risk-free soloing in a wide
open plain. Just you, your companions, and a dungeon waiting to be explored.
