Hmm, elves drop elf meat, dorfs drop dorf meat.  I guess you can use
RP to hunt your own kind as a druid, but I think once you cross over
into cannabilism you become a dr00d.

Huh?  I see this being a much bigger problem for Paladins of course,
but as holy-rollers they probably deserve the headaches.

Aha, you differentiate between regular and intelligent race NPCs.
Where do you draw the line though?  Ability to do quests (sarnaks and
goblins both allow this)?  Ability to speak common (frogloks and
undead frogloks and almost any other non-animal/plant classed MOB)?
Vendors (Krak the Aviak)?
I figure if they're not on a faction that I worry about, and they look
at me funny, they're fair game.  You'd be amazed at how many dumb mobs
are eyeballing me right about now.
Hell, I'm gonna eventually have to take down my god Bristlebane just
because he alwasy travels around disguised as a smelly halfling rather
than the witty and urbane bard that he really is.
