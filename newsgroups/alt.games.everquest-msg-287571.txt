I thought it was,

Original behaviour: Client loads all the resources required for the 
entire zone, and receives information about all NPC's for the zone, 
while the 'loading' screen is up.

Changed behaviour (prior to the last patch): Client drops the loading 
screen, but continues loading resources in the background, client now 
only gets NPC information for NPC's within a set radius.  People 
experience a broad range of issues.

New behaviour: Client now leaves the loading screen up until resources 
are loaded, the code for 'not knowing about NPC's outside of a certain 
range' is still in, but until other issues are fixed the range has been 
set to infinity.

The boards do have extensive posts from SKlug discussing the changes, 
and why they are being made.
