Most recent event I've seen was an archery competition the other night
for lvls 20-40. My 23 ranger ( Doryn, Tunare ) won for most damage in
a single hit. Got some 5ac 3agi/wis amulet for it. Actually, his
damage was only 2nd highest ( bow crit for 44 against a lvl 50 target
), but the one that got highest ( lvl 40 ranger ) pretty much swept
all the categories, and they could only award him for one.
