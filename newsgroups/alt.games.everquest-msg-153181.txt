Well, first of all there's very few mobs in the Grey that are over level 49. 
You have to fight the sun revs to get anything 50+ (except for the random
named, but you're not "exping" on them).

Assuming you were fighting the sun revs, hell, assuming you were fighting
anything, the 49 cleric is being PLed with a 60 monk and 60 warrior in the
group.  It almost wouldn't matter what you were fighting at all, anywhere. 
The 49 cleric is gonna be moving along nicely.
