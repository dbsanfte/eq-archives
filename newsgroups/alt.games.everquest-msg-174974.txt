Don't know about your server questions.  I guess because it's new, enjoy it.

There is only one server specifically for roleplaying and only a couple PVP
servers (I think) so I guess the ratio of Vanilla to PVP/Roleplayers would
be pretty high.

If there is I don't know it.  By the way, Druids and Rangers are among the
most commonly played classes.  Seems to me the most rare is Paladin.
