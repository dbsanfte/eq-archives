Definitely, find a decent guild, but don't expect them to all rush in to 
help you complete your epic immediately.  You should expect to have to 
prove yourself to them first, and expect to help others in the guild 
first before you get help.

Actually, with spirit of the Leopard or Panther, the shaman pet is a 
killing machine.  Well, at least prior to the nerf, have not tried 
soloing with him again since then.  I did not even bother to use DoTs on 
the mobs, just keep FA and Leopard on my pup, and sick him on a mob.  
Even for mobs that run, they rarely ran far enough to matter.  I did keep 
my best nuke memmed to help finish off a running mob, but that was it.  
Root was useless, as the Leopard proc would just break it immediately 
anyway, root was handy for CC the few times that the mob did run far 
enough away.

I did a DoN with 2 Beastlords, 1 Mage, Cleric, and a Ranger to tank.  
With leopard on all 4 pets, I didn't even bother to slow the mobs.
