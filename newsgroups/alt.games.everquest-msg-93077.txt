Last Thursday.  I took two nights off from raiding and just powered it 
through.  I had forgotten what it's like to have the EXP bar move.  Just 
one more blue bubble then AA, woot!   (Guild recommends that you maintain 
at least 1 yellow in 60 before you start AA.)

That's true, but there aren't that many place to solo for exp at 59.  I 
was chanting expedition guards and actually getting very good exp; 
waiting for mana to start a charm-kite cycle drags.  I can sit in Velks 
now and solo for exp, though I'm still learning the timing.  I haven't 
gotten it perfect yet, but I think I'm on the right path.  I found a way 
to keep myself close to max haste and still have 50hp/tick regen.  I just 
need to find an old-world dungeon with blue mobs now.  :)
