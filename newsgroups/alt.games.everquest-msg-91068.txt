Lemme get this straight. You don't find it odd that Tech support is not open
24 hours. Who cares if you know its going to be down. I have not seen any of
my post bitching about downtime, have you?

 But I sure bet that if your car broke down at 10pm, and roadside assistance
was only open from 9-5, I'd see you bitching a tad. Don't you?

Talk about clueless some more, your making me laugh.
