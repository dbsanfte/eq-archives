Northern Cal, actually (Marin County). :) The email that you replied to
with your suggestion of how to cope with 4-way stops included me talking
about an unusual quirk of the laws in Finland. (Where my husband is from,
and where I had to learn to drive this past July on vacation.)

<snip explanation of Tort law and where such information could be found>

....ok, I think I understood all that. Woot, I learned a new word! :D
I'll pass that along to him, thank you.
