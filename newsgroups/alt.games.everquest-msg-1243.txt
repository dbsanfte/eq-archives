Well I thought I'd found an entry for this category last night when I
met a Half Elf Warrior.  Then he told me that he was a follower of Inny
working on Cabilis faction because he was KOS in OT due to race and KOS
in FV due to religion.  The guy was having fun walking a path few would
dare to tread, I was impressed.

th
Half Elf Druid
Gnome Warrior
Gnome Rogue
Human Paladin
Sure, I've got some normal chars too, but the odd ones are good fun I
say.
