Not that I'm a fan of the Rathe "ATM", but personally I think it would
be a BadThing[tm] if all loot rewards were carefully scaled to the
difficulty of the kill.  I much prefer a variety of choices, where
different levels of risk vs. exp, risk vs. loot, and exp vs. loot, are
there to be chosen from.  Do you think it's a bad thing that the "easy"
xp route for solo Druids and Wizards (quad kiting in outdoor zones)
usually grants much lower loot rewards than dungeon diving in a group?
Do you think it's a bad thing that the "easy" path for xp grouping in
Kunark outdoor zones gives poor loot?
