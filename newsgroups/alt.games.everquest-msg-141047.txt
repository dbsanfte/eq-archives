I can do that.

The only problem I have noticed between turning Velious models on and
off is that when I turn them back on, I have to remove the piece(s) of
armor with the graphic and zone before I put it back on for the
graphic to be updated. Otherwise, I run around with old world graphic
showing for that piece, and if I take it off or even put something
else on, the graphic is still there. (Obviously, this only affects the
armor my character is wearing, not other people)
