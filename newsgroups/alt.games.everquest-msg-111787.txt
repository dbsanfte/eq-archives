Location:    Exploring Luclin, Tenebrous Mountains - looking at entrance to
Katta Castellum.
Chimp:   In travelling mode: Shadowed, Jbooted, Mage Sheild and Dead Man
Floating.


The Chimp eyes the guards at the entrance to Katta Castellum nervously -
after having dropped Shadow long enough to determine they would like nothing
more than to staple his Dark Elf Necro entrails over the city gates as a
warning to other undesirables, he then re-Shadows quickly.

What to do? Skirt around? He unrolls a parchment to check the alternate
route to Twighlight Sea but quickly discards this option. Deciding to bite
the bullet, he memorises the city schematic as best as possible, refreshes
all the buffs and Shadow, shouts "Banazai" under his breath and races
through the city gates. After zoning in and being momentarily distracted by
the "puuurty" buildings he soon discovers the shortcomings of a 2d schematic
in a 3d enviroment...

Lost. Bugger. Totally.

After about 3 minutes of sneaking around, trying to look in all directions
at once - the Chimp passes through a heavy guard concentration and of course
Shadow starts fading at that exact moment, causing quite an unpleasant
sensation in the lower intestines. Just managing to clear aggro ranges,
breathing a sigh of relief, he changes his underwear to clear the shamanlike
"soiled breechclout aura" and then recasts Shadow. A bit more... scouting...
(read: hopelessly lost wanderings) and he spots The Cliff.

The Cliff.

Not <a Cliff>, not even <the Cliff>, but most assuredly <The Cliff>. He
carefully peers over the impossibly thin ledge snaking way to far
downwards - oh well, a usable landmark anyway. About to set of down the
ledge he stops abrubtly...

"I bet there is half a platoon of guards lined up along the top lip of the
cliff, out of sight but still in aggro range, just waiting for Shadow to
fade again. Why else make such an obvious and log chokepoint? Hah - you
won't get me, I'll cut accross and float down!" he mutters to himself. So -
stepping out....

"AAAaaaaiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee<takes a
breathe>eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee" *splat*

*Loading, please wait.....*

"Oh bugger.....wonder whether these jaunts give me frequent flyer points?"

Footnote:     It puzzled me enough to go back and check the logs as I did
not notice any "you are about to fall" messages. Sure enough - the Dead Man
Floating was stripped off on zoning into Katta Castellum - looks like it's a
no-lev zone...Doh!
