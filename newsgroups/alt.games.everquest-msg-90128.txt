There is also the druid snare pull with DOTs.  instead of fear kiting, you
are pullilng it around so you control the flow.  Double DOT for around 2100
in 10 ticks at 54th level.  5 ticks until you reach partner.  Aggro is
massive.  Even with a wizard druid team with the wizzy full nuking from
first chance, I've had mobs ignore them to come after me with this technique
and if the wizzy gets aggro well, his turn to play chase me and I can nuke
too ;)

As for adds,  simple for a druid.  Snare, pull to side, root.  continue with
main target.  Post 50 actually can be very easy with this technique in a
team and sure beats the hell out of fear kiting because aggro shifts are
instantly and easily controlled.  Just flop down on your arse and have
partner back off when aggro shifts.  You'll get it back.  Fury of Air or
recast snare a couple times and it'll be back on you so you can continue.

As for some fun team combos -- try Ranger Druid or Bard Druid.  very fun and
interesting combos.  Also the Rogue Druid combo is fantastic as well -- here
it comes after the druid and the Rogue has an open back and if it aggros him
he doesn't have to worry about going toe to toe until someone taunts it back
off him -- just back off until druid gets aggro again then continue working
that backstab skill... ;)

Mostly, it all depends on how comfortable and skilled you are with playing
your character.  I've seen bards that are mana generators only, Druids that
can't do anything but DOT, Nuke and haeal.  Enchanters who think that mez,
haste and clarity are the end all be all of their existance and clerics who
think that they are healers only.  Mostly it boils down to knowing how to
play a character well and looking for how to take advantage of lifes little
problems  -- like how come this friggn caster always gets the aggro and no
one can get it off him???  Ok, snare and run around.  We'll see if it dies
before I do..  Neat!  That worked well!  hmmmm.... <grin>
