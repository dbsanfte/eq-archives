Root is not in fact necessary for your DOT to work at full power.

Melee is another option to make a mob stand still, and fear is a good way to
make a mob run but not towards you.

When you consider the mana efficiency of a DOT, by the way, you should
add in the cost of whatever you are doing to keep that mob still.

If you are rooting, then you've got to keep casting your root.  If you
are fearing, you'll have to keep casting that too.  If you are melee parking,
you'll probably be putting DS up... although unlike fear or root, that
won't be resisted and won't wear off unexpectedly.  You'll also want
to factor in healing cost in this case, although I find I rarely heal myself,
as what damage I take generally heals itself while I med... so I'm getting
"free regen" out of the deal, double dipping by regenning mana and HP
at the same time.  Badly hurt, I'll treeform, so you could add that cost
in; at higher levels this will be regen or chloro or what have you.
