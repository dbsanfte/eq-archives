You will need to move your NIC to a different PCI slot. Most
motherboards that have 5-6 PCI slots have this problem. There are not
enough IRQs to go around. Some system IRQs (like for USB) will be
shared with one of the PCI slots. 

If you have the manual for your motherboard, it should tell you which
IRQs map to a given PCI slot. If you do not have the manual, you will
have to move the card and see what happens. If you have other PCI
cards, you might have to shuffle them around as well until you get a
good config with no conflicts.
