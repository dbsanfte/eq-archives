I do know that they're not engaged in combat.  I also know that they
have voluntarily joined a game that provides a social setting in which
communication between strangers is explicitly encouraged.

It changes everything.  Communicating with you when you have voluntarily

is far, far different than blindly ringing your home phone when you're
trying to sit down to dinner with your family.
