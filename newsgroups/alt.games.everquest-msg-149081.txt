I pay for 4 accounts every month because everyone in our family plays, some
more than others. I have been playing for 8 months and I have only
petitioned twice for something that took some time to resolve.  Other
petitions were simply to say that vendors were out of place. (more like
reporting a bug than a true petition)  My son has made one petition, and my
daughter and husband, none.  So, using your math, our family has used $7.50
worth of CS time.  In that same time, we have paid in $414.40.  Seems a tidy
profit to me.

Since complaining about customer service seems to be the topic of the week,
I will say that in my experience it has been pretty bad.  A couple of weeks
ago I petitioned that a merchant (the one in Shadowhaven that sells food
outside of the bank) was out of place.  Three hours later she was still out
of place.  I petitioned again.  The next day when I logged on, she was still
out of place so I petitioned again.  A few hours later, she was finally
fixed.

I can't imagine why it would take so long to fix something this simple,
especially when it seems that the same GM's have loads of time to debate
over whether a name violates policy or not.

I am sure that what's happening is that the money generated from our monthly
service is being used to fund the development of EQ2.  After all, that stuff
is not cheap.
