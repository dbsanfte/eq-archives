Just a thought, that came to me on seeing threads mentioning the bazzar
and silk.

Would it be practical to speculate on the bazzar market ?

(Probably need 2 accounts)

Have account 1 selling only item x (say stacks of silk)
Set the price to be a bit higher than normal

Have account 2 running around and buying all the silk that is under
cutting you
If you could manage to do this for a period you would probably see
prices creap up towards your "high" price. At this point you could
inflate the price again.

I guess this could be a guild activity.

Any thoughts ? or is it just totally inpractical ?

Cheers,

Jim
