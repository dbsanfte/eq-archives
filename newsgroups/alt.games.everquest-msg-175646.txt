	Yes (you can get to 65 in first-teir planes) but you are cutting your own
throat.  Every level you gain reduces the amount of useful content in the
game.

reasons.  You can't use those mobs to level on past 61.  At 61, a third of the
'shrooms in FG are light blue; at 62 they all are.

difficulty in earning flags is capable of wrecking a guild.  Yes, if the guild
doesn't utterly collapse and disband you'll get more people levelled up.  And
then you get to go through this again.
