As I said in another reply, my experience had been identical to yours up 
until our last few runs in tactics this past month or so.  I put my 9th 
coldain ring buff in my top slot, as I always have done in tactics, got 
the rest of my buffs, and never once did I have to refresh the ring buff, 
but I did have to get new conviction, c6, and a couple of self buffs, 
several times during the runs.  It was really odd, and I was far from the 
only one in the raid complaining about this behavior.
