Well, the suggestion was to zone, and not actually kill him due to the
faction hit.  But being lvl 42, most mobs that are high enough to increase
my Defense skill, are usually able to kill me in very short order (minus for
being a cleric I guess =) )  This is part of the reason why I would like to
get my Defense skill up as to increase my overall AC and make me last a
little longer when that MOB gets pissed and decides I'm a larger threat than
the 2 warriors and ranger that are wailing on it.  =)
