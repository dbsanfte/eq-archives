/pet guard me will cause the pet to attack every mob around you. Try use
/pet follow me

I always have /pet guard here and /pet follow me hot keyed, so when I'm in
dungeon, I do /pet follow me when I'm moving, and I always stop and turn
around to make sure that pet is follow me. Check your pet on every turn you
make. If pet doesn't walk in a path that you would expect it to, immediately
do /pet guard here to stop it. Then do /pet follow me again to try again
until pet follow you right.
