Lifetap is not merely a DD, its also a heal at the same time; mob
takes 50 points damage and you -gain- 50 points.  Now you might
think that would add up to 100 points of effect, which would make
it twice as valuable... but you'd be wrong.  Mobs tend to have
lots more HP than comperable level *non twinked* players, so that
50 points of heal is probably the equivalent of 100 points of
damage.  

Still only 3 times the value, of course, while they are charging
over 8 times as much for the thing.  But you have to look at the
costing mechanism they put in place; being higher level doesn't
give you just a little more LDoN points, it gives you
geometrically more.  At the same time, they geometrically
increase the point cost of items.  Now an item twice as good
costs 4 times as much, so you can either be a slightly higher
level and get it for the same basic effort as the lower level guy
got the lower utility item, or you can work 4 times as hard to
get the better item.
