Went and picked up my Battle Cry tome at the vendor in EC while waiting 
on an LDoN group; in fact I ran to the POK book in WFP and went to the 
trainer in POK, handed her the book, and ran back, still making it 
faster than half the group.  Where do these people come from who take so 
long to cross Norrath these days?

I hadn't put any real effort into doing this because I've heard that the 
discipline is universally despised, as it blocks all use of other 
disciplines by everyone in the group while its up.  Nonetheless, as with 
my casters who like to get every spell, I intend to buy every discipline 
and at least test them out for myself.

I cleared it with the group, not one of them actually use any 
disciplines in combat at our level, so I was free to experiment.

Trouble was, I didn't have the endurance to actually activate the thing, 
when an opportunity came up!

At 32 I was able to activate it, uses almost my entire yellow bar.  I 
didn't experiment with it much, logging out shortly after hitting 32, 
but it looked to me as though it not only stopped my other traditional 
discipline, the minimally useful Focussed Will, but also my cool 
berzerker snare, stun, jolt abilities, and my "make throwing axe" 
abilities.

While not being able to make axes, or to use an ability which helps me 
regen a bit faster while not in combat, are hardly crippling, taking 
away my once every 12 seconds ability to do something useful is a huge 
price to pay.

Assuming I can log on sometime today (have to go put a roof on a 
building first) I intend to check it out with a log and see if I can pin 
down how much of a boost to attack speed it is, certainly should be able 
to see the boost to Attack stat.

With a 1 minute duration every 30 minutes, it really doesn't seem like 
something important to normal exp grinding anyway; perhaps in an LDoN 
when we hit a boss mob or a massive overpull, or maybe when I'm soloing 
and hit something relatively tough like the tainted/corrupted mammoth 
pair.  Trouble is, its on mobs like that where I get a lot of milage out 
of stunning as fast as I can, and where the ability to jolt off aggro 
(in a group) or to snare when intimidate happens to work when soloing, 
are most important.  I don't know about everyone else's disciplines, but 
those three are key abilities for a berserker, and I doubt any boost I'm 
getting to attack speed and attack are going to make up for losing them.

Grage, 32 Berserk, Luclin
