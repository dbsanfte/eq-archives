Turn the clipping plane down.
/shownames 1 [this reduces names to first names only. 2 is first and last, 3
is first name, surname, and guild, 4 includes titles too]
/showspelleffects Off [no more pretty particle effects]
/hidecorpses all [hides all corpses- do turn this back on under options when
done in bazaar. having the corpses drawn does cause lag, and i've seen some
spectacular corpse art in the bazaar]
Go under options and turn off bard songs. [I have seen bards rude enough to
leave a spell going, and it can lag some people out of zone]
Stand some place away from most other people- like the back near the arena.

If none of these help, go have a chat with yer ISP and find out why they
can't keep a steady connection when yer idle.
