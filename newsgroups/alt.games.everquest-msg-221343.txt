Evil wasn't hard before, actually (well, at least for Dark Elves...never
tried an Iksar to high enough level to leave Kunark).  Being evil basically
just keeps you out of certain old-world cities, but by the time you've left
the newbie area, you don't really need cities that much anyway.

There are some quests that require you to go to specific cities, and that
can be annoying.  E.g., the Wizard epic had an important NPC in Halas, which
is annoying.

The spell vendors in Katta are annoying, too...they won't deal with Dark
Elves, even though according to the story of Luclin, they should.
