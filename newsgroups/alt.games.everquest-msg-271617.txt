Taunt isn't a problem for berserkers either, chain stun and if there's a 
"real" tank present, he'll have to work at taking aggro away.  Kick 
is... fun, berserkers get that too, but rarely use it because it takes 
the same timer as frenzy, which is significantly better damage, again 
until the mid 50s, when its failure to scale up means it eventually ends 
up being little better than kick.

OK, assuming that all defences and AC are the same, and that there are 
no weird class based differences between the two classes (SOE can't be 
trusted not to screw with that stuff, but I don't think they did in this 
case), you're missing the key difference between rangers and berserkers.

Berserkers get stun.  No mana required, insta cast stun, doesn't get 
resisted much either.

While a ranger and berserker standing back to back fighting two 
identical mobs would both take damage at the same rate normally, the 
berserker's mob will be stunned for about a third of its operating life, 
without diminishing the berserkers' damage output at all.

Slow handy?  Doesn't matter, because the stun effect stacks with slow, 
the mob loses about a third of its slowed damage output.

Once you get into the mid 50s, though, you start hitting mobs that are 
immune to stun.  Suddenly, the berserker's one big advantage drops off 
the face of the earth, and you're left with a guy in a ranger suit but 
no dual weild, no fancy attack buffs, nothing but snare and his own 
version of jolt.  Or you could look at it as a guy in a rogue suit with 
a pale imitation of backstab (hey, at least its usable from the front).

I won't even attempt to pretend its anything like a guy in a shaman 
suit, unless its one who's had his entire spellbook turned into recipes 
for pickled beets.
