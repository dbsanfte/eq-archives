I've given this some more thought, and I think personally I probably would
not make much use of a solo ldon for xp purpose.  I really only enjoy
soloing when I'm doing a quest.  If they could make an adventure into more
of a quest then I'd go for it.  Right now its really more like an xp and adv
pt grind with a quest skirt on it.
