I have a dell inspiron 5000, with 600 MHz pentium, 384 MB RAM, 12 GB
hard disk; CDROM and a broken floppy drive. I run EQ in 800 x 600
resolution.. I use it for a trader mule, zoning takes for ever (2
minutes?), but i can,  in a pinch, zone to pok to go check out vendors
etc. I can also zone to other zones and do quests etc. I can also solo.
But I do spend a lot of time looking down, my far clip zone is 5%, and
I believe I have all luclin models turned off.

Funny..this USED to run pretty good, post luclin but with luclin models
turned off, but it just seems to have gotten slower with latter
releases of EQ.
