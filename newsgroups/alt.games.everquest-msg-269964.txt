There were quite a lot on the server I was playing (Antonia Bayle). I found
grouping really easy. It was the customer service I couldn't stand. I
finally got to the point of asking a GM what the formal complaint procedure
was.

"It's in development."

So essentially SOE hasn't worked out a formal complaint procedure despite
years (when did they take over from verant?) to work it out. Either that or
the gm was lying. He appeared to be asleep at one stage, so maybe he wasn't
fully awake when he claimed that.

Anyhow, at that point, I cancelled my account. I  figure SOE has an
interesting attitude to customer satisfaction. If you are not happy with us,
don't tell us about it, go somewhere else. So I'm hunting for another game.
I like the idea of WOW but i hate PVP, or city of heroes, but i hate kill
stealing. In any case, I've learnt that there might be a MMORG invented one
day, but until then, it's barsh barsh barsh! I don't mind that so long as I
start from that angle and keep my expectations low.

It's a shame. The great majority of quests were great, and there were
technical improvements in the way mobs behaved that I really loved. The
scenery was fantastic, and the crafting better than most (although the whole
inventory space/no offline trading issue was really irritating and made me
give up on crafting to the end, just seems to give an excessive advantage to
people who can pay more for extra alts to acts as bank slots). I might start
playing again if i see some response back from a dev.

the whole argument, if you care to read a rage filled tirade, is here
(parental guidance recommended)

http://eqiiforums.station.sony.com/eq2/board/message?board.id=quest&message.id=17172&no_redir=true

If you don't, the gist of it is that i thought all the manuals should have
had the same advice, and that a warning should have been placed in the
journal on a particular quest that formed a black hole for my favourite
character since Kunark. It all swung on the meaning of the word "undertake".
I dunno, maybe they were working off some really weird definition of the
term.

I shall now undertake a journey to another game, but shall pop in from time
to time in the hope that eq2 improves.

Good luck to everyone,

Eski (retired), ex-antonia Bayle, ex Rodcet Nife.
