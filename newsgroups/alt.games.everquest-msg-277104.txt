Why? We already have property law covering items whose value is not innate,
but related to that which people assign to it via 'the market' (see, say,
stamp collecting) and intellectual property laws which cover nothing
tangible.

Why, by nature of being virtual (rather than say, being the game companies
property) is this not 'property' per se? If, say, a draft of a book can be
stored on a hard disk and considered property, or an mp3?

Shrug. 400$ is big bux in many countries. I can imagine being pretty pissed
if someone stole a months salary from me.
