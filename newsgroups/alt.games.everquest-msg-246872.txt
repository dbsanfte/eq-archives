I, as a former guide, see the ups and downs of this.

Ups:
1. Most guides genuinely want to help people, because they know
exactly how it feels to have a problem and have no one else around to
solve it, whether it be griefers or a problem with the game. More
power would allow them to do it.

2. It would ease the emphasis on the need of GMs in a lot of
situations.

Downs:
You can never be entirely certain that the person with the power that
is not associated with SOE would use it properly. 99% probably would
be respective of what they have been given, but there is always that
1%.

I dunno, I was just so frustrated as a guide (and this is over a year
ago), that all I could do was raise the level from green to yellow to
red for petitions with people who truly had problems. Griefers and the
like know that guides have no real power over them, so they never
stopped when faced with the threat of a "guide". Now, give a guide the
power to do something, and they'd be quaking in their boots..
