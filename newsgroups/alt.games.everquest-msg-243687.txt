For an example of a game where real life monetary investments result
in a stronger play position, take Magic the Gathering.  You -can- play
with a 60 card starter deck... but people who spent hundreds of
dollars on cards would utterly trash you (given similar skill at
playing... yes, a complete idiot could still manage to lose quite
easily with thousands of cards to choose from)


Although they couldn't generate limitless quantities of cards, real
life money was deliberately factored into the game.

I played a similar game online, ChronX, for some time, had a ball with
it... and in that case, there were no physical cards in existance,
just computer memory I was paying real life cash for.  They could
generate a (nearly) limiteless amount of cards, and I don't recall
anyone questioning the legality.

While I don't like the idea of SOE doing the same thing (the game
-wasn't- designed around the idea, and doesn't seem balanced for it,
plus I didn't sign up for that sort of game in this instance), I don't
think there's a legal issue with it.  And as someone else pointed out,
yes, the government does regulate it... via taxes.  SOE makes money,
the US government (and California and doubtless county and city their
corporation resides in) all take a piece of the action.
