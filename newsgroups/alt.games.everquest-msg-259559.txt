OMG, who can forget the first time they ran into that room and fell below to 
what (at the time) was probably a quick death? LoL I still remember that 
first time, one of the scariest I'd ever experienced. I never fell into any 
of the tree traps in Blackburrow, those were somehow more obvious, or maybe 
more well-traveled and legendary. But that trap in Befallen, some sick 
designer there ...
