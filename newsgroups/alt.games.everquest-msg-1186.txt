Neither =) i play a shaman as my main and always prefer the cleric in group
to add his/her buffs alongside mine. most of our buffs stack with cleric
buffs. Cleric's ahve great resist buffs and ac/hp buffs the shaman's ones
are good to but can stack with the clerics most of the time. Shamans do have
the str, agi, dex etc but don't pass up the cleric buffs. My shaman will
cross a zone to get them when they are avaiable.
