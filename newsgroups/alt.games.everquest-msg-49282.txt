Ooops.  I hate to take sides here, but I think Lokari kicked your ass with
this one.  It's like you admitted that you were buzzing around for the sole
purpose of being a nucese and she swatted you away.  Very clever use of the
kill file switch.  Good timing, good form.

Usenet debates are a fascinating game of strategy, tactics, and diplomacy.
It's like.  There really aren't any hard rules, per sei, but you can always
tell when somebody's getting their ass kicked.

Best Regards
