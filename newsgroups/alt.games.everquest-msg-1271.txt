That is a matter of personal preference. The Erudite has hands down the
best INT in the game, and therefore the easiest to raise to 200. After
200, added INT doesn't matter, so you can start adding +MANA gear. The
Erudite casters have the largest conceivable mana pool, which is
important.

Drawbacks of the Erudite are, no night vision. As I am sure you have
already discovered this can be a pain. I think we get Deadeye at 8th
level which will give you Infravision, and there is the Harvester
(retails at roughly 400 plat) that can be acquired via a quest in
Solusek Ro that gives the Deadeye effect. I am assuming that you are
not a twink, so the likelyhood of you having or obtaining this item for
awhile are slim.

Poor AGI. Erudite casters start out with an AGI of 70. If you didn't
put 5 points into it at the beginning, your AC is really affected by
this. 75 AGI is a magic number. Below that every point really affects
your AC. I really hope you put those 5 points there. True this can be
made up for with magic items, but you want to save slots for INT/MANA
items, not AGI.

Other pros of Erudites, is that they look pretty cool in most of their
outfits, they can wear Flayed skin which looks really nice, but doesn't
give much as far as INT. Cosmetic issues normally isn't the driving
factor for most players. It wasn't for me.

All those things not withstanding, someone once told me, it isn't
important how much mana you have, but how quickly you can recover what
you have. That is why I think the Iksar has a distinct advantage over
all of the other Necro Races. Their regen allows them to have the Dark
Pact series in effect (up to Allure of Death, Call of Bones and higher
drain too much HP) while medding and have no or little loss of health.
In fact, the Iksar can have the Dark pact up at all times and see
little effect on their overall HP. We get mana regen before any other
class. At certain levels it is more effective than Breeze/Clarity.
Allure of Death at 20th level regens 4 points of mana per tick. Breeze
only does 2.

So even though the Iksar has a 110 INT to start with, and it will make
a difference at the early levels. I have gotten mine upto 160 (157 with
my Forsaken Pariah Mask on instead of the Sheer Bone mask), and just
hit 29th level. From 12th through 28th there is little change in your
DOTs, you get Shock of Poison at 24th which is nice. Therefore you
damage output vs mana used stays pretty much the same through this
period. Since that is true, I rarely ran below half mana after 20th
level or so when soloing. I have only used a couple of spells so far
from the 29th level, Dooming Darkness and Boil Blood. They use up
nearly twice the mana of their predecessors, and the change is
noticeable. In the few battles I was in (grouped mind you) I was oom in
each one. I am at the point where I need more INT gear. This is the
first time I have seen the drawback of a relatively low INT. At 34th we
get Call of Bones, I hope at that time the spell will change this. My
drawback right now as far as INT gear is I really don't have much cash,
and the slots I have left are the hardest slots to fill with INT gear
(arms, legs, hands, feet, shoulders), there just aren't very many items
out there for those slots that give INT. My monk friend and I are
headed to Guk to try and get some items to sell, we are becoming cash
poor.

Now that I have rambled on about that for long enough, I will get to
your other question of where to hunt. Just hunt in Qeynos Hills. There
are Gnolls standing outside the entrance to BB you can easily solo.
Rabid wolves, rabid grizzlies (great quest for the Rabid Grizzlies, but
I don't think you can get into the Temple of Life being a Necro).
Another option is to hunt in the Qeynos Aqueducts, I haven't hunted
there except to hunt Cuburt for the Golden Ear stud. But they recently
added a 20% xp bonus while hunting there, so get a good map of the
aqueducts and see what you can do there.

Whatever you do, good luck. Just remember don't do alot of travelling
at this level with all of your stuff on you, if you die without your
stuff, who cares about the corpse? And there is a bank in the
aqueducts, as well as a Necro guild.
