>   Where is a good place to go to find out prices on items?

  http://eqprices.com and http://www.allakhazam.com both attempt to do
the job, but it's not really something any site can do successfully.
Prices will change as new content is added, items are nerfed,
improved, have their drop rate altered and as more of them make their
way in to the economy.  These sites can be useful in getting a general
idea of "what is worth more that what", however.

  As noted, the only thing you can really do is pay attention to what
people are trying to auction the items for in sell zones and take that
in to consideration.  You can also ask guildmates or friends if
they've bought or sold the item recently.
