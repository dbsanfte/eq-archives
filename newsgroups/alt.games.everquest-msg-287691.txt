Nothing makes people love you more than when you single-handedly put
an end to turtle AVs or WSGs.
Both factions were had about the same amount of reinforcements (77 or
so) and had only the last two towers to be capped. The Horde was
hammering away at the Alliance at the bridge. The entire Horde team
was on the offensive and the entire Alliance team was on defense. The
Horde kept capping the towers and the graveyard, and the Alliance kept
re-capping them. At this rate, the Alliance was slowly losing
reinforcements as the Horde=92s pressure grew. I was already in the BG
for 40 minutes, so I hatched a plan.I made a break for Stonehearth
Graveyard and ran through the Horde offensive.

I made it to the graveyard and fully drank up. I waited until the next
wave of Horde respawned at the graveyard and ran to the flag. I
hardcasted a Howl of Terror and send the guards running. I  quickly
capped the flag before the guards returned and before the Horde
respawned. The result was the entire offensive teams being sent back
to Frostwolf Graveyard, relieving the pressure, and allowing the
Alliance to mount an offensive of their own. We won, and I was praised
for my accomplishment.
