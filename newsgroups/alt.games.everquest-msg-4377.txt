I didn't ask for a watered-down Cliff Notes version of the question. I
asked what the question was. You see, the phrasing and context of it
may have large bearing on how you were received.

But then, I expect that's why you responded with the Cliff Notes
version.

I did read on, and I understand that you may want to think this is
what you're doing, but that you're incorrect. I think I can safely say
that you haven't inspired anyone to engage in soul-searching. After
all, if this was your gift, one might expect you to have had some
positive impact on Avenger and Getsumj in your history with them.

I'm sure you're right, that they do not know any handicapped people.
The "short-bus" attack is being used because it's precisely the kind
of insult the target can understand and will respond to. That is the
point of making insults, after all - to upset the target.

To make other connections as you're doing is to pretend at political
correctness. From what I've seen, you're not much for PC unless it
suits the needs of the moment.

>My point was that they speak sometimes without thinking

And you consider their targets to be paragons of reasoned prose?

Presume as you will, it won't affect anything. If you draw conclusions
about people based on a fractional picture, that's entirely your
business.

>I have no problem with the "trouble maker" label.  I <do> have a problem
>with the "short bus" reference.

I see. So you're willing to overlook the actions of your compatriots
from FAng, but are anxious to attack people you barely know in a
newsgroup that you've just begun reading.

>The only reason I would categorize you is if you were to prove yourself so.
>Am I to assume that's what you're doing?

I'm not out to prove anything about myself. I'm just here *being*
myself. I recognize that some people may strongly dislike me for who I
am, and that others will like me. Which group you eventually decide
you're part of is irrelevant to me.
