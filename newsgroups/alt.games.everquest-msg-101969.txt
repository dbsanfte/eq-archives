Well, my guild are VERY careful about spectators now, after a raid on 
the General in Kith for the rogue epic. 30+ people are starting to 
gather in Kith, and some level 9 halfling dr00d ask if he can watch 
while we kill General. We of course agree which result in noob dr00d_01 
pulling the entire DE camp at us, and killing around 20 people.
Worst part is that the guy actually asked for a rez.

So now were not so keen on people looking at what we do.
