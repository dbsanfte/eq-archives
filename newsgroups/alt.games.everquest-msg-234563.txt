I've got an AMD 2600 prossesor
768 MB Ram
128 MB video card
Windows XP
Yet While I'm at the Bazaar sometimes my screen goes black...dead black.
(It has happend once when I was playing.)
It has nothing to do with the monator,since my modem would light up when
there is a internet link,and it is dead when it happens.
Whats going on?
Any help wil be apreciated.
Could my system be crashing?
