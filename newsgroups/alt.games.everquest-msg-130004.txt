Ah-um, that would be ME.  And I *didn't* make a "comparison".
My statement was: "somethimes they do funny things - like monkeys".
YOU are the one giving a cute, funny monkey a BAD connotation !!
I didn't use the term "monkey" as a noun, I didn't say they were
a bunch of monkeys or anything like that.  All I did was compare
their "sometimes funny actions" to the cute/funny actions that
monkeys do.  ...Like that dude "beaning" himself in the head
with a rock sling he was spinning over his head. Fuck! that was
funny!!  I honestly can't remember laughing that hard. Really I can't.
