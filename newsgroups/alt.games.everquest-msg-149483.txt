It's simple supply and demand. I'm a parent of a 10-year-old who enjoys EQ.
I play it too. If there were no swear filter then he wouldn't be allowed to
play, ever; and if he weren't able to play then we likely would drop it and
save the $12/month. I wasn't even aware of what the specific rating on the
box was and don't care, I do my own ratings on my kid's behalf.

There are many parents who would agree with the above approach to EQ and to
any other MMO game where our kids are going to interact in real time with
older strangers: no swear filter, no customer here. Whereas the swear filter
may annoy the older player but won't drive them away from the game. So if
I'm Verant, this decision is a no-brainer.

Actually when I'm playing it amuses me sometimes, adds a bit of surrealism:
"You hit the stonebeaker fgr7uir$ri [that is, cockatrix] for 26 points of
damage."
