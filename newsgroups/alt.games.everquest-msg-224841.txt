The large 'public betas' are stress tests, and very little is really 
required of your testers except that they be logged in.

Everything that needs examination is done at the server side (load 
monitoring, lag monitoring, etc)

They should really limit these open beta players to a handful of zones. 
(Think 'Odus') to prevent it becoming much of a 'spoiler' for the real game.

Of course, if they did that, they couldn't use it to sell LoE boxes. :*
