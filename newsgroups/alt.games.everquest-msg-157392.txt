Oh please... Grow up. Speaking as a Druid, and one of the classes that you
so obviously are whining about, PoP is a fantastic addition. So we cant
portf for profit any more.. big deal. We can still level as fast if not
faster than any other class out there, and still have fun doing it.

If you built your druid/wizzy just to skin people by porting, well then
thats YOUR Issue, and not VI's.

Content changes... get used to it.
