Well if you're considering it's parts the whole is still... a game. Wanna
call it splitting hairs go ahead. It's still a correct statement. So you're
saying you must like *each* element of a game to enjoy the experience?
Don't know about you but I like *certain* individual parts of every MMORPG
I've played and have yet to like *all* individual parts.

So? Is it because of the entirety of the game or an individual element. I'd
rather guess it's, more often than not, an individual aspect of the game.

I was recently on a tour of Latin America, and the only regret I have was
that I didn't study Latin harder in school so I could converse with those
people.
