Agree and disagree with what you write.Indeed we Wizards do get snare at
level 29. Bonds of Force is the spell and it's highly resisted! Also, the
AoE spells needed to quad at this level are very expensive to cast. It's not
just case of 'bum a SoW' and be like a Druid, even assuming you have the
Staff of Temperate Flux, which is hard to get at level 29 (solo) you'd
hardly be able quad like a Druid at level 29.

Wizards don't *really* quad *that* fantastically well until level 51 -
Atol's Spectral Shackles is fabulous.

Safe hunting,

Stevie.
