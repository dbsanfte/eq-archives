Huh?  Which game are you talking about?  EQ1 definitely has a
confirmation box on rez.  (And given that, if there's a rez in
EQ2, I'm surprised they left out the confirmation there.)

The discussion up to this point has been mostly examples from
EQ1, though admittedly that wasn't made explicit.  (The bit
about the power-levelled level 65 Froglok was a strong clue,
though. :-)
