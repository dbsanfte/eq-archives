Does everyone realize the person everyone is talking about was 21 years old
and living alone in his own apartment and that he shot himself with a gun
that he bought for himself as an adult?  Everyone keeps talking about this
as though he were a child.  Maybe because his mother is suing; he comes off
as a child.  He was an adult, 3 years into legal adulthood actually.  He
wasn't a boy, he was a full-grown man.  The primary aspect of the story is
addiction by an adult, not the parenting of a child.
