I would not worry about your skills maxing yet. At level 3 there is just not
enough fights between levels to max almost anything. Once it is taking
hundreds upon hundreds of fights to level you will be able to keep all your
skills maxed without any trouble , all you need to do is remember to switch
out a weapon to a different type once one of them maxes, then when all are
maxed you can go back to your best skill , or the one you have the best
weapon in. Dont worry about having the most DEX , as long as it is above 75
there is really not much more need for it to be worried  about. You want
STAM because this is life and STR because this allows you to carry all your
fancy weapons and massive armor . A warriror must live without any spells .
You are given HP and AC and then sent out to stand in front of huge beasts
and fight to the death. The more of each is the more of a warrior you are.
Just for an example I checked on my lowest level warrior and right now just
carrying weapons and armor at lvl 15 he weighs in at 125 . I have armor and
weapons that increase STR, AC and STAM thats it .
Anything else dont concern your self with . In order of importance imo is
STA , this is harder to raise with in game items than any other
characteristic. AC , this allows you to take less damage per hit and get hit
less , VERY VERY important . STR , lets you do max damage on your connecting
hits and lets you carry lots of gear and loot. Believe me it sucks being a
warrior and getting all dressed up in your fancy armor only to realize you
cant even carry any weapons or loot, sucks going back to town .
