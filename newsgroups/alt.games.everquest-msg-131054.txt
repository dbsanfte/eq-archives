You might try Hollowshade Moor,  the girmling chieftain drops the Skull
Shaped Saacrificial Hammer.  Nice weapon for a caster as it procs a damage
shield and being lore they can be had from someone camping the chieftain
when a second one drops (that's how i got one at 16th level).  I later found
another one on a merchant in the same zone for 105pp and bought it for my
warrior to help build his skill (6/24 isn't an impessive ratio to someone
who duals an elder wolf jawbone and a sturdy grimling mining pick but it's
fast for learning).  The weapon is all/all and looks cool as hell too.
