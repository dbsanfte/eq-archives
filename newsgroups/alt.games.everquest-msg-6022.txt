>Now you've got me curious, what did he give you?

I was in BB heading to the SteamFont Mountains. That's a long trip on
foot. I didn't want to really stop, but the ogre hailed me and I
wanted to be polite. He asked me if I wanted some stuff. He used
abbreviations for the stuff he had, but I am rather new to the game,
so I didn't understand most of them. So I said, sure. He handed me
three backpacks. I thanked him heartily and continued on my corpse
run. I got my stuff back and started fighting. After camping some mobs
near the windmill in SteamFont Mountains for several hours, I finally
became overburdened. I went through my stuff. One of those three bags
was filled with food. The second was filled with some kind of belt
that sold for a pretty penny. The third bag contained some kind of
shield that gave me +10 cold resistance. It looks almost transparent,
and I actually have been asked several time where I got it. In that
same bag was some kind of beverage that would increase two of my stats
by I think +5 points. Finally, in that same bag, there was some kind
of minotaur axe that was far better then any weapon I was using. I was
a level 10 dwarf pally at the time. I wish I knew that ogre's name.
I'd like to send him a private tell letting him know how grateful I
really am.
