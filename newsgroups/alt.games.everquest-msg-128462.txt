> so who has research? i'm mega-curious about how random pet summoning is

I don't know but I was wondering that too.  I was having a lot of trouble
finding the right words, so at level 22 I was still fighting with my 16th
level pet.  Most of the time I would summon a pet that conned green to me,
but sometimes he would be light blue and sometimes even dark blue.  It
couldn't have to do with conjuration skill, because then once I had summoned
a dark blue pet they would all be dark blue.

It's probably just random.  Kind of like combining success-but it seems that
there would be some contributing factor or factors.
