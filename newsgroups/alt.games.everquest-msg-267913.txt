I did want to point out that it's doubtful this particular case applies 
because the subject matter at hand wasn't copyrightable.  Motorola was 
merely reporting on the factual aspects of the games themselves: the scores, 
the time remaining, etc.  It was not reproducing descriptions of the game. 
It was merely reporting the facts, and facts aren't copyrightable.  Unless 
you think items in EQ aren't intellectual property, this doesn't apply.
