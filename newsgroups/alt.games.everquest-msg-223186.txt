Who assigns the values for the list?

IF its done manually, there's no way this would be playable, since 
groups can last as little as ten minutes or as long as a few hours, but 
rarely cohere much longer than that without a change of at least one 
person; a new list every (average of) hour?  Who wants to work that hard?

If the list is compiled automatically, then what do you use to assign 
value to gear?  I might want my Tizmak robe because of its stunning all 
white leather look, while my buddy would disdane its poor showing in 
armor class, yet another might like its HP bonus enough to not care 
about anything else about it.  Further, personal preferences aside, some 
classes get mana for their INT stat, while others get it from their WIS 
stat, some need HP more than either, some will find AC of importance, 
others will need focus effects while other classes (pure melee and bards 
mostly) don't benefit at all from focus.

The Value of any given object varies wildly from character to character 
and from player to player.

One possibility would be to let each player code in his personal value 
for his items... but then you'd still face the onerous task of setting a 
value for each item that can possibly drop in every encounter in the 
world.  I doubt I'd like to sit down and put a value on every item each 
of my dozen or so alts currently have on, in inventory, and in the bank, 
I'm Certain I don't want to have to face the same task with a checklist 
of every single drop in the entire world (literally thousands if not 
tens of thousands) and that task would be multiplied by the dozen 
characters since each would, for reasons I've already mentioned, value 
each drop differently... but wait, I might want item X which is low 
value for my character A I'm playing right now but would be great to 
give to my character B.

If I did so, I'd not have a replacement item marginally worse than item 
X to give to the next player in the group.

This is the sort of idea that looks good on the surface, but which a 
working knowledge of the game and a little though will reveal is 
cumbersome and unweildy in the extreme in practice.

That said, I've heard of this very system being used (not automated, but 
more or less as you describe) in small "family style" guilds, in major 
raid guilds, and even in regular groups.  The paperwork to do it in a 
guild must be astonishing, and in the group situations its rarely so 
formal, more a case of "wow, thats an upgrade for me, does anyone want 
this old item it replaces?"

Lastly, your method has another flaw to it.  Item X replaces A's Item 
X-1, which goes to player B.  B gives up his X-2 to C.  C gives up his 
X-3 to D.  D gives up his X-4 to E, E gives up his X-5 to F, and F now 
has item X-6 left over.  Who gets item X-6?  You didn't solve the 
problem of a single loot item going to 6 people, you just changed which 
item it is thats left over!
