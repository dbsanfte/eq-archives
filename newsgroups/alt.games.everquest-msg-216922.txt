game husband is a 62 shammy, but when we met his main at the time was a 
48 beastlord[now in his 50s also]. I also have a 31 bl, and a 22 
necro...i appreciate pets=)

i love having pet classes in the group, any extra dps is worth it. I got 
the chance to play a 65 BL in beta...as a hoot, myself, and a couple of 
friends [playing a 65 SK and a 65 pally] decided that since the 
characters we ha had hole keys to putz around and check it out. We got 
all the way to the tower before we had to leave....made me realize how 
different play is above 60 compared with below 60. The sk and bl pets 
were as good as having a couple of 50 baby tanks along=)

I sort of got out of the habit of rooting if grouped because it can mess 
up someone assuming that at 10% a snared mob is going to turn around and 
stop whonking you...but a good stun gives me time to step back and the 
mob will turn to face me and look away from the poor robe he was pissed 
at. Usually the robe sort of fades back and are replaced by someone who 
will whap the mob enough to get it less interested in me=)
