Hmm mage seemed to me to have one of the best choices of AA, now.

To me it sounds like you definitley enjoy the journey more than the end, at
65 the game becomes mostly about progression to new zones, via raiding, sure
there is lots of other stuff to do but most of it is not level based.

Some quests are good to do, if you like them, shawl, coldain ring, robe of
the oracle, epic, etc are all involving all with good rewards.

Either that or as you say, start over or quit if it is no longer fun.
