No. I post from 2 different ISPs/PCs (hence the different headers)

Personally, I think you should leave the thinking to those who are
better suited to it, not to mention those able to recognise irony
(a_moron) when it bites them on the bum.

That's your argument? Try backing it up with the statistics, the
maths, the formulas... and chuck in practical experience from people
who have played shamans/SKs/pallys/rangers to level 55.

My SK is 52. A good friend's Shammy is also 52. Tonight, I'll pose the
following question (with no preamble explaining it):-

"Would you say that you can tank as well as me?"

I'll let you know her response (verbatiim) tomorrow.

>Your argument:  "Guffaw"

That wasn't an argument. That was a response to a ridiculous
statement.

>Yeah, that's a way to defend your arguments.

You're arguing that black is white. Just how much defence does it
require to refute that?

Entire newsgroup? ROFLMAO
First off, count the number of people who replied. Secondly, count the
number of people who post here. See a slight disparity in the numbers?
Thirdly... nobody (and I repeat, for the hard of thinking) *nobody*
"bitch-slapped" me. Taking feeble swipes at me isn't a bitch-slap. A
bitch-slap would be if someone were to manage a cohesive, lucid and
logical refutation of my words.

Nobody is capable of this. Or rather, if they *are* capable of this,
they haven't sought to do so.

Bitch-slap? <laughing>

Where are they all? I want to see a list of names of people who claim
that "until mid 50s, monks tank as well as warriors". I'd like to
laugh at *them* too... it seems a shame to waste all of this mockery
on one such as you, who lack the wits to understand why you are being
mocked.

<blink>

That indicates bemusement.

Well, I'm sure they've read your words by now... I don't see them all
falling out of the woodwork to back your claim.
