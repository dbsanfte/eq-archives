Well, I seem to be stuck in that rut again.

My Warrior has made it to 35. I have a full set of crafted (minus the boots)
and I am now wielding some pretty good weapons. From my point of view, my
warrior is sitting pretty well. My problem is.....what now?

Grouping seems to have gone away. I see posts and websites asking "Where are
all the tanks?". I am asking, where is everyone else? Over the past week, I
have gone from one side of Norrath to the other. Visited every continent and
zone (well, The ones I can at my level). You know what I find? Nothing.
Headed to Kunark. LoIO, OT, FM, WW, you name it, I went there. No one needs
a warrior. Hell, other than LoIO, most places are deserted.

Went to Lavastorm, SolA and B, NRo, SRo, the swamp, Ferrot and everywhere in
between. Deserted or filled with low level people. The few times I can find
people of groupable level, they don't need a warrior. I even spent some time
in Velious. Found that to be a nightmare. Getting there alone without SoW or
Invis (or even trying to find a bind in the ONLY place I can be bound).
Somehow people are under the impression the Paladins and Rangers Tank better
than a True tank. At my level, I have run out of options. I can solo, but
that would require HUGE downtime to bandage myself and regen. What am I
supposed to do now? For the past few days, I have simply been running around
helping the newbies and keeping them safe but, lets face it, there is only
so much I can do as a warrior.

Is it time to start a new character? Been thinking Shaman. Can heal and buff
(help in finding a group). I can solo Kite (not the best but better than a
warrior) and when I help out the newbies, I can do a lot more than I could
as a warrior and it is probably the only class I have not tried. I don't
want to give up my warrior. I am rather proud of what I have accomplished
with him But I seem to have hit a wall. Without a group, I can't go any
further as a warrior and groups seem to have become non-existant.

Any suggestions anyone could provide would be helpful.

Thanks in advance.

Zacheia
