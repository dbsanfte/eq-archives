OK, this is bullshit, and you should know this.  As has been stated
MANY times in the past, by everyone involved, TCC only causes lore,
magic, or no-drop items to not drop if NOBODY in the group gets
experience from the mob.  The lowest Zol Knight is level 40, which is
still blue to 53 or 54, and gives exp to 55 (I think).  The lowest
level Kor Shaman is 42, and the lowest level Dar Knight is 43.
Granted, it's not entirely uncommon to have a group 56+ in Sebelis,
but I rarely if ever see an entire group 58+ which will be required to
invoke TCC on Kor Shaman or Dar Knight Drops.

Huh?  Permafrost has a number of problems, and has always had these
problems.  It's to hell and gone from anything remotely resembling
civilization (no offense Barbarians, you just live in East Bumfuck),
it is rather confusing, it is absolutely stuffed full of aggro greens,
and you're almost guaranteed to get killed by something casting from
another room if you're anywhere near level appropriate to hunt goblins
there.  None of this has anything to do with TCC.  A zone that has had
design and implementation flaws since the beginning has nothing to do
with TCC.

Of course it would be exactly the same if the lower levels left.
Every account brings the same revenue, level 1 or level 60.  Of course
some of them cost a lot more to support than others.  

I'm not exactly ecstatic about TCC, but as someone who has never
camped greens, I'm certainly not going to get all upset about it
either.  I really think that Sony/Verant has enough brains to realize
that TCC requires them to rethink the way they implement drops for
quests and the like, and I expect that they will eventually make a
couple minor changes like exempting mobs levels 38 and higher from 
TCC (38 just because that's one level above the Rathe Mtn HGs, which
are a benchmark mob for a lot of illogical reasons).  I'm sure there
will be one or two new and desirable quests which will require a drop
from a green mob, and Verant will fix it, hopefully quickly.  I have
seen hundreds of rants about how TCC will break all the quests, so I
assume that even the totally incompetant morons at Verant (you know,
the same folks who are so stupid and worthless that they can't even
write a game with 400,000 paying subscribers that is perfect and
bugfree and makes everyone happy) would know that this may be an
issue.  I don't think anyone at Verant is sitting around saying, "Bah,
TCC won't require us to do anything, our users haven't raised any
issues."
I honestly wonder if most of the folks bitching about TCC were
pre-Kunark.  Before the launch of Kunark, any reasonable high-level
dungeon (except Kedge Keep because of lack of obtainable EB items) was
totally overcrowed almost all the time.  Folks got into the habit of
killing time camping greens for drops.  Other than quest items, would
many folks really have spent all those hours camping for no exp if
they had an option of getting into an exp group immediately?
