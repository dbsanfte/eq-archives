Someone will doubtless correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly certain
that damage shields don't protect you any.  All they do is inflict harm
on the mob hitting you.  In fact, the "reflects" thing doesn't even only
inflict harm up to the limit out of what you are taking... I can take
one point of damage and dish out 6.

Damage shields are handy things when you have a lot of mobs hitting
you fast and preferably lightly; they pretty much kill themselves.

I don't believe "pain and suffering" is a mob, invisible or no.  What
happens is if you take enough damage to almost kill you, you
bleed to death if not healed fast.  This process registers as "pain
and suffering"

You don't see it all that often, because usually mobs that do enough
damage to kill you -really- kill you, instead of putting you down
on the floor.

Again, I could be way off base here, just how it seems to work to me.
