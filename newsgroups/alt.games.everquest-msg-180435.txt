I know several clerics that can and do solo when the mood suits them.  They
don't play Battle Clerics generally.  Highest level one I know is level 60.

See above for cleric soloing.  As for the cost of KEI, the group should not
be paying for it, is the cleric the only one who is getting KEI?  So, should
all the people in the group that bought KEI be compensated for it.
Personally, I have never once asked a potential group member whether or not
they have KEI, and, I have never been asked as a prospective group member
either.  If you, as a cleric, feel that you can't play without KEI, well, I
probably don't want you in my group anyway.

You might want to check with him on what all classes and at what levels he
plays first Scott.  He has quite a collection of characters.  The rogue is
just his most recent one.
