Nope, ShowEQ really isn't neccessary nor wanted for things like that.

Death at these levels are meaningless (just a few minutes of CR time).
You have necros and clerics on standby for SC and rezzes so it's
hardly a major issue.

Even if you do run ShowEQ and get a complete map of the zone, it still
doesn't show you pathing, warping points, mob behavior, etc...which
are FAR more critical than knowing where things pop.

It's really not hard to find mob spawn points in ToV.  These are
generally dragons and wurms, really hard to miss.
