It's only been recently (last few months) that I've noticed folks
announcing themselves to be "twinked".  OTOH, not long after Kunark
was released I saw "two L20 Paladins, both with Ghoulbane, LFG" or
something very close to it in Unrest.  So I'd say the "I'm cool
because I'm a twink, too bad you suck" attitude has been in the
game for at least three years, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear
it had been spotted a few times in beta.  It's really just the flip
side to the knee-jerk jealousy some folks have toward twinks, hell,
it's probably be the same people on both sides of the coin.  For
that matter, it seems to me that much of the bickering about what's
"right" and "wrong" in EQ boils down to "If I like it, it's right,
otherwise it's wrong", and I do not exclude my own dislike for the
destruction of the (already wounded) under-50 game by KEI from that
judgement.
