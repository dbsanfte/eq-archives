Yes, I love stealing experiance form lower level folks.  Heck, every
chance I get I go clean out Blackburrow just so nobody can hunt there.
My evil knows no bounds.  *sigh*  Must feel good to be so morally
superior.

Anyway, I have all 8 character slots full for my server.  It's a nice
old server, always pretty packed, and I have yet to be unable to find
a place to camp for experiance.  And three of those characters are
pure melee (monk, rogue, warrior).

Here's a question, how many level appropriate groups are going to be
able to handle a dungeon like the new Runnyeye?  Even the exp modifier
won't be able make up for the what they lose from mulitple train
deathes.
