Greater PROBABLY (along with the speed DT mentioned) gives infravision, but
since my druid has infra anyway, I wouldn't know without research.

Yup, I used CL for a while, too, though if you have time to cast Combust you
should.  Fury of Air's a really nice spell, however the recast time is a LOT
slower than what you're used to.  You can't chain-cast FoA.  If you insist
on keeping long-term spells memmed (such as Skin, which I'm betting is one
of them) at all times then I'd go with Combust as primary nuke unless you're
hunting in SolA or SolB.  You really should wean yourself off of keeping
Skin/STR or any other buff beyond SoW memmed at all times, though.
