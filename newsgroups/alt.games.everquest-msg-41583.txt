Agree strongly.

Certainly there are times when Verant simply doesn't realize that
there's a problem, which no doubt some would like to paint as hiding
the problem, but you're right - when Verant knows they've screwed up,
they don't lie about it.

As for the oft-repeated situation of blaming the user's ISP, I can
certainly see why that's Verant's first response to trouble.
Considering the installed user base, and that people connect to the
game from *all over the world*, no doubt in the overwhelming majority
of cases of connectivity issues there really *is* a problem with the
user's ISP. Anyone who cannot grasp why this becomes the default C/S
reaction has simply never spent any time in customer service.
