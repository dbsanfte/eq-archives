    It was when I had to be places. Maybe my server didn't have a large 
supply of taxi whores, but most of the two boxers I knew levelled up 
babydruids just because of how stupidly hard it was to find a port to where 
you needed when you needed.

    Yeah, PoK was what made travel perfectly safe. It wasn't the in-game 
maps with annotations, it wasn't a tutorial that spits out level 5 
characters, it wasn't an easy zone (Paludal) off of a non-KOS city zone that 
lets players zoom to 20 in no time, it wasn't full spoiler sites that tell 
you what is in a zone and where, it wasn't a death system where you can't 
lose a corpse until much higher levels, it wasn't Soulbinders in every city 
allowing travellers to rebind along their route, it wasn't the mudflation 
that made someone pretty much immune to death from what aggro they could 
pick up in a zone (assuming they didn't have SoW to simply outrun the 
aggro), hell, it wasn't the knowledge that running along zone walls avoids 
almost every mob in the zone. It was those books, which in almost all cases 
(Gunthak, Great Divide and Nexus books are the only exceptions off the top 
of my head) allow you only to travel from one newbie zone to another. Damn 
them for making a zone that made travel so easy between cities, not that 
you'd care to go to any of those cities because PoK itself has all the 
supplies you'd ever want!

    The books didn't kill travel. It was already dead for every player that 
knew something about the game. Did they destroy the sense of grandness for 
new players? I'd say yes and no. Yes, it made places that seemed remote much 
easier to access. But it also opened those areas of the world up to those 
new players, and made them realize exactly how many places they could go. 
Zones that weren't easy to access were already being bypassed for zones that 
were, because players don't want to spend half of their online time either 
running someplace or finding a port there, then trying to find a bind near 
their new hunting grounds. Books are the life support for most of the 
underused zones in the game.
