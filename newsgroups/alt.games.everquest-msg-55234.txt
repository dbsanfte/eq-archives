I have never understood this.  Most programs that require a key use 36
characters for the key (A-Z0-9) plus, perhaps, something to separate
the key into parts.  Then they often print it in a typeface that makes
it hard to tell 1 and l apart, and 0 and o.

The one time I had to require a key for a program I wrote, I used the
following characters:

 ABCDEFGHIKOPRSTUWXYZ23456789

and then made it so that 1, J, and L would be accepted for I, 0 and Q
would be accepted for O, and V would be accepted for U.

At the cost of making the keys slightly longer (because my keys were
in effect written in base 28 instead of base 36), we got rid of almost
all problems with people persistently typing the key wrong.

(How much longer?  A key that is N characters long in base 36 is
1.075 N in base 28.  E.g., a 25 character key in base 36 would need 27
characters in base 28).
