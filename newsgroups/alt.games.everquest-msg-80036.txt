The exact same thing happened to me on Xev. After around 49 levels or so as
Dominic I got a tell from some guy with his panties in a wad accusing me of
stealing his account. I was /anon at the time so he could see what I was. I
couldn't understand him at first and with his ranting I thought he was
trying to scam me. Finally I figured out what he wanted , took off /anon and
showed him I wasn't a lv 9 warrior. We had to get  a GM to straighten it
out.

The kicker is since lv 20 I had been Dominic Thesilent. I had interacted
with Gm's more than once with no one having a problem with my name. This one
without even discussing it with me changed my last name to a blank space. So
I not only don't have the name I had for almost 30 levels, I can't simply
give myself another one, cause the server see's that I have a last name
already, it's just a blank space. In order to get a new last name, I have to
petition when the head Name GM is online to approve my new choice. I've
never managed to find the right Gm on when I was thinking about it so now
I'm lv 53 with no last name still.

Her complaint? Names can't be titles. God I get pissed just thinking about
it.

Hello all.
Just an FYI...
Over the last few days I'd been having difficulties logging on as my
main character (Tzen) at certain times.  When I did manage to log in,
I started getting tells from level 10's saying "Hey bro, are you ready
to hunt more orcs in EC?".  Now I havent hunted orcs in EC (with Tzen)
for around a year, so I said "erm, no you must have gotten me confused
with someone else".  But this guy said it was yesterday.  I also get
/tells from friends saying a guy with my name was on the server, but
wasn't me.  Pretty strong evidence, to say the least, of something
strange going on.
