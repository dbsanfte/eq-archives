Thanks all for the info.  I was knoll hunting and several Adept books 
dropped.  None were any of my current spells and just wondered if one 
dropped, could I use it or when I leveled and got a spell, if one of those 
books was something I could use, did I have to wait and go thru the App 
levels to use it.
