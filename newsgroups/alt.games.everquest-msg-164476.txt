Since the release of EQIM a few weeks ago we have received a lot of very
positive feedback about this new EverQuest feature. The most common comment
was "this is great, it should be free." At its launch we had planned on EQIM
fees to offset its development cost.
Happily, your very positive response to the release of Planes of Power and
the continued growth of new players has put us in the wonderful position
where that cost is no longer an issue.

A big thanks to the EQ community old and new for their support of the world
of Norrath. Please enjoy your free EQIM.

- The EverQuest Team
