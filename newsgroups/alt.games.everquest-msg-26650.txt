Nor have I.
I'm a 26 solo mage and I about fell over from shock last night when someone
asked me for some bandages out of the blue. I think maybe five people in my
whole time in EQ have ever asked for money from me.

SoW beggars are the druids favorite rant. Really it just breaks my heart
that they have spells that are so good the whole world wants them. Talk
about unintended balance. The good news is that you have spells that will
make you the most wanted group class and will also enable you to solo with
ease. The bad news is that you will be hounded like a dog for free buffs.
