But where?  I'm primarely here for the loot at the moment.  Being a caster,
I need the funding...though at times I'm feeling as if player economy was
making me platinum faster.  I've got just under 300pp total, not including
what I've spent on spells (about 140-150pp total?), and my stein of Moggok,
200pp there.  So I've made about 650pp by LV12, and only about 50pp at most
from selling loot (but that will hopefully increase now that I'm looting
1-2pp items every few kills).

So I ask, where should I go (TO SOLO - due to playing times), after I feel
I'm strong enough in the bank?
