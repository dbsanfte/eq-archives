Lol, well 44% of my co-workers didn't know him at all, and
1 of the other 5 took a few moments to dredge up "He named
his kid Moon or something, didn't he?"

So you'd lose your bet.  I live in Portland OR.  Frank Zappa
hasn't been in the mass media in many years, and even then
he wasn't incredibly popular, so yes, obscure.

I would no more petition Zappa then a bard named Paddy or
Riada.  Heck, I had a bard named Padraic for a short time.
Yet it wasn't an intentional reference, I just like Irish
names.
