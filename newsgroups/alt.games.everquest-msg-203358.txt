I have also had that a lot lately....pissed me off, but i finally figured it
out

The screen is there in the background, click on "r" on the keyboard to check
the never ask this again box and then click "y" key on keyboard to say yes it
should allow access to the internet....and it will continue to work even tho
you can see the pop-up
