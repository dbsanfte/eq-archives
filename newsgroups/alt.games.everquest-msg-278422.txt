The Quest starts in castleview hamlet near the fountain at the top of 
the bell stairs. You are then sent to find another frog on the south 
beach of antonica alas he's not there and you run all over archers woods 
looking for him. You finally find him at the pond and have to lead him 
to a guard tower where he promptly dies. You then have to return to 
castleview to tell the frog there about it. He tells you to come back 
later he has to meditate on it. Thats as far as I have got although  I 
have heard you have to clear out an assassins den and follow the dead 
frogs spirit around ant.
