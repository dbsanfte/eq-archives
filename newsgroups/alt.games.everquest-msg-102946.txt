Sadly, they never made the 2nd part... the narrative was added as an
afterthought.

They ran out of money.

The Animated LotR was mainly made with UK money... and UK cinema in the late
70's (pre- Star Wars, pre-Home Video boom) was dead, so it flopped at the
box office. When the animated film was released to TV and it was clear
there'd never be any planned sequel, they added the narrative to tie up the
loose ends. If they'd waited for maybe 5-10 more years, then they'd have had
video release cash coming in, maybe even more of a chance of some TV network
picking up the production costs.

Nice idea, but bad timing killed it. :o(
