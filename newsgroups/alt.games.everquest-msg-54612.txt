I wouldn't say nothing came out of it.  On Innoruuk Rathe Mtns was
full of odd undead, dropping some pretty nice items, almost all
class-specific and no-drop.  My guild took down the level 50ish undead
Drake that was killing people with a 500pt AE, got a nice warrior
ring, and some other stuff.  Of course we were awarding it to people
who were there helping (since it wasn't as good as what we were
wearing) and some little fucker ninja-looted a piece.  Guess that's
what happens when we try and do something nice.
We did get a AC4, 5 to some stats, 10 to all resist all/all necklace,
think our wizard is wearing it now.  I passed on a 13/26 bard 1hb with
effects, figured there were folks who would actually use it in zone,
and with 180 people there when we left, it seems the word was out.
