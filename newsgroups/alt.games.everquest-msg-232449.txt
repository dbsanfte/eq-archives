Gratz.  My magie just hit 65 not too long ago, too.  I took the philosophy
that levels are most important, so I was woefully short on AA (4 when I
dinged, now up to 6 spent and one banked).  On one hand, I feel a little
"naked" and underpowered. On the other hand the amount of potential my
character has left makes me smile. I thought that I would immediately quit
when I dinged 65, but now realize there's a lot more to do!
