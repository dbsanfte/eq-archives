Congrats on your druid and being able to solo, but everyone knows that the
druid with their DOT spells is much more mana efficient then some other
classes.  I am not complaining about whatn other people do, I am just making
a point that the game was much more playable with faster mana regen provided
my KEI.  Maybe alongside the soulbinder in cities their can be some sort of
mana regen person that can give a player faster mana regen for a price so
the KEI casters who were bothered by all the people asking for KEI will not
be burdened.


>>Why couldn't you expore those same new areas in a 6 member group?  The new
LFG tool, while not being used as widely as I'd hoped, is being used to the
point that I can usually find a group when I want one.<<

I can explore new areas in a group, but as I have mentioned I play solo
because I cannot dedicate 2 or 3 hours to playing in a group.

Just another suggestion...  When you were getting the "tells" to provide a
port for them it would have been pretty easy to type /r I am sorry I cannot
right now.  I have found that works when people ask me for a rez.  But if I
am free I gladly do it for no charge. Did 5 rezzes yesterday alone.
Hopefully something can be done to allow us to play the game without so much
downtime.   Just a few thoughts...
