  Well, from what I can tell, the designers are hoping that griefing and
ganking will be kept to a minimum because overall they want the design of
the game to not reward such behavior.  Towards this end, they are planning
on implementing the following measures:

  - Cities will be run by players/player guilds.  There will be a limit as
to how far you can advance using the GM run cities, as their facilities will
not be as supportive to high level adventuring as player run cities can
become.  This, supposedly, will make reputation a more important concern.
If that low level character you're ganking happens to be in tight with the
guys in charge of running your's favored base of operations, you might
suddenly find himself KOS to all guard NPCs in that city and allied cities.

  - Deemphasis on the importance of gear and gear deterioration.  All gear
will be transistory and require that you maintain it via tradeskill NPCs/PCs
(money sink) so losing or gaining a nice piece of gear is not as big a deal
as in EQ where gear is king and where gear never deteriorates.  Your ability
to own a sword may be more dependent on your ability to maintain that sword,
rather than your ability to initially obtain it.

  - Experience penalties and rewards for dying by the hand of a higher level
character, or killing a lower level character will be small.

  - An overall deemphasis on "individual" achievement and one that is more
heavily centered around guilds and social alliances.  Achieving the "soft
cap" of level 60 is supposed to be pretty easy to do, and gear is transitory
and not the central focus point of the game anyway.  Part of what Wolfpack
is banking on is that people will be more interested in being a part of the
city building and city maintaining aspects of the game, because it carries a
greater connotation of power than will levels and loot.  Anybody will be
able to obtain levels and loot fairly easily by the game's design (from what
I gather)... the real challenge shall be in securing your own Tree of Life
and running a city, or being in a guild which somehow assists in the
maintaining of a city.  Achieving these goals will not be possible through
simple "ganking"... it will require careful planning, a lot of support, or
perhaps trickery and deception.

  It's possible that the members of the successful guilds will be the
gankers, thugs and malicious PKs.  However, which city would you use as a
base of your character's operations--the one that's run by PKs and gankers,
or one of the ones that's run by a relatively free and even-handed group of
individuals who don't condolne these actions and will shitlist anybody who
they witness doing so?  Also, socially, who do you think people are going to
try to overthrow first to steal their Tree of Life... the asshole gankers,
or the people who actually run a stable city?

  It's all theoretical at the moment.  It's impossible to say whether or not
the system Wolfpack has devised will work with "real people" in real
situations, but I will say they have their work cut out for them.  I also
plan on trying Shadowbane as soon as it comes out, it's by far the MMORPG
that has most captured my attention.
