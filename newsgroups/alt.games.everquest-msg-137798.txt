No, not all of them, only a very few of them. They're called
"activists" and it's kinda their job in our society.

There are activists for all kinds of causes. Perhaps you've seen some
recently - might've been a Religious Right activist, or a pro-gun
activist, or a Greenpeace activist. There's lots of 'em, and they're
not exactly the downfall of the human race.
