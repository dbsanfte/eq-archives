In combat, turn off autoattack and use your "hide" skill.  If successful, it
will say something like "you evade" or "you step away from the combat" or
something like that.

The effect is to reduce the amount of hate the mob has toward you.  It's
like the Ranger's "jolt" spell, or the Wizard's "concussion" spell.
