No, probably less.  Dunno what I was thinking.
Must have slipped on my sliderule.  I meant
to say 2%.

Seriously, 10% 20% something like that... thing is when it DOES go
off it usually doesn't mean you live, because its like somebody hit you
with a GHeal or so, a speed bump on the way to death.

DI seems to work more often, and when it DOES work its a total
refresh like CHeal, so if you aren't totally hosed there's a good chance
you aren't dying after all.  It does seem to have a terribly short
duration, though, DP lasted what, an hour?  A useless hour, but there
it was.  I can't see using DI on an exp camp based on what I've
observed so far, even not caring about the 13pp a shot expenditure
