Actually, more fun would be to make it so that casting a powerful buff on a
low level person *usually* works, but has a chance (which goes up as the
level difference goes up) of failing badly.  Possible failure modes, in
order of most likely to least likely:

1. The attempt to focus so much power on the young one kills them.

2. The attempt kills them, with no XP res possible.

3. The attempt kills them, AND leaves no corpse.  (Better put all your twink
gear in the bank before asking a level 65 to buff your level 1 twink!).

4. Same as #3, but the explosion also kills the caster.

5. Same as #3, but the explosion also kills the caster, with no XP res
possible.
