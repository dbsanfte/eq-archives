I don't know about some of you folks but I get really sick and tired of
getting hounded for "free stuff" by suposed newbies...

The beggars that hang at the bank asking for "free stuff" just flat out piss
me off.  I've seen enough liars out there to have become jaded to the "I'm
new..." approach.  Hell, I met a 40th level guy who told me he would gen new
chars so he could get extra stuff by begging...  He would gen a char, run
around begging then turn the stuff over to his main.  Delete the char and
create a new one...

I mean come one damn it...  I go hunting to get stuff for myself, friends
and guildies, not to have some beggar hounding me around the zone "Can you
can spare???" routine.

Don't get me wrong about this, I have no problem helping out newbies but I
look for the ones who are TRYING to make it on their own...  As a halfling
Druid I pass through Mistythicket quite a bit being as Rivervale bank is the
fastest place to hit for me but these friggn guys that claim to be newbies
just get annoying.

A few favorite memorable ones of mine are:
The level 3 warrior that came to IG camp in Everfrost mooching plat and
FS...  Ok, level 3 NEWBIE that knows how to get out to the IG camps AND
isn't intimidated at all by them AND will run to each of the 3 giant spots
asking each person for stuff...  hmmm...

How about the level 1 wizard in Sanctus Saru "can you help out a newbie?"
Yeah.  Sure.  Lemme see, you accidentally ported to the moon then ran
through a couple zones to get here then you ask for help of anyone who
enters zone via tells -- not for ports out -- no way!!!  For "Stuff"...
Yup.  Gotta be a newbie that doesn't know anything about the game there...

My favorite classic gotcha fellow -- a level 1 druid "Hail friend -- can you
help out a new druid just getting started in the game?"  -me- "not now --
sorry.   I'm trying to find out what level Call of Earth spell is I got as a
drop." --him- "Oh, that's level 50 Ranger spell." -me- "newbie eh?"
