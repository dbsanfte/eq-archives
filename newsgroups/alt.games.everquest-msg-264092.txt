There are 5 LDoN camps.  Each has a number of dungeons.  And there are
4 types of adventures.  I'd be willing to be you could LDoN from 20 to
65 and see more variety than the people who follow "the perfect path"
along Paludal LoIO Karnors whatever...

But I agree, just doing LDoNs would probably become a drag.  I did
mostly LDoNs from high 40s to 65 and I had a great time most of the
way, especially with fun groups.  Got some nice gear.  And although we
generally finished the LDoN in 45-60 minutes, I had a few "beat the
clock" experiences that were really exciting.  A couple of times we
had all but given up, and then thru a combination of luck and skill
managed to pull off a win.

I'd have to say that the hassle of finding a decent group and a decent
area to fight had really been turning me off before LDoN.  It was the
real shot in the arm I needed to get interested in EQ again.
