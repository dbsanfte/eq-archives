Just stick to BB, its a great place to level up to 10, 12 or so.... Maybe
you could ask a sweet high level char to kill a Splitpaw Gnoll Commander for
you, I think thats the one that actually drops the Runed Totem Staff in
BB.... or at least one of the Splitpaw Gnolls that are in BB...If I was
there, i would kill it for ya :) I won't be back there on my server for at
least another few lvls....  at lvl 5 you cant kill em yourself, you will
have trouble with those at lvl 15.

Once yer up to 12, you get the spell bind, which makes traveling a lot
easier... get the bind spell, and then go for the journey to FreePort. Once
there, go to NRo to hunt dervs, and from 13 and up hunt Orcs in Oasis til
yer about 18 or so... then head out to Kunark, to go to Lake of Ill Omen,
and hunt there till yer 25 or so...

Thats my suggestion for now :)
