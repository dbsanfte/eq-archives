Sorry to keep the xpost going, but have to get this one:

Basically, pyramid schemes have been ruled as fraud, since they so
often are exactly that. They've been outlawed by the FTC for ages now.
It's not "giving and receiving money". It's people preying on the
greed and gullibility of others to make money for themselves.
