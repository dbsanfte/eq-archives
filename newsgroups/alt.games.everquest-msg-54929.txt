    Speed up recovery. Log in the necro, who only needs one coffin. He
summons a caster (bound outside), caster gets ressed and dressed and hands
his coffin to the necro, who then summons the next caster. The tanks get
their coffins out of the bank and either run back or get picked up by a
druid/wizard. When they arrive, same deal - hand over coffin, get summoned,
res & dress.

    I've been through the "OK, send some folks to buy coffins, oh we need
money, where are the tanks?" kind of CR and it takes forever. By the end of
the CR, there's no desire by anyone to try again and the raid is a
morale-lowering failure. If people see that they can pick up quickly enough,
they'll want to try again and overcome whatever wiped them out.
