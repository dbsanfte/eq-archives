What is this "windowed" mode? I am also in 640x480 and noticed the same
thing about the whole screen not using my full monitor when I changed
resolution. I want to see all this stuff that everybody else is seeing.
What specific changes do I have to make? I really like the full screen
mode with nothing on the screen but then I can't see health bars or
anything.
