I agree.  It's takes a bit of time to understand all the nuances of the game
(faction, aggro radius, etc) without having to worry about twisting and
various bard-centric oddities.  The only reason I felt comfortable starting
a bard as my second character was because my roommate, at the time, had a
fourty-something Bard on Prexus.  That way, I had someone to show me how to
twist and stuffs.

Just out of curiosity, was twisting ever meant to be part of the bard's
repitore, or did players figure out that it was possible, and it just stuck?

I think alot of people are attracted to the phenominal cosmic power that a
bard has.  Problem is, a bard is a creature of extremes.  A poorly played
bard can be the absolute worst thing for a group (I'm not talking about
malice, simple incompetence).  Likewise, a well played bard can completely
change the nature of a group.  The sheer effort work involved in playing a
bard will eventually drive the baka wannabes to strip their bards, sell all
the class specific stuff, and start a druid (which will piss people like
Celano off just as much as they're currently pissing us off).  Oh, and the
druid will, of course, be a halfling.
