I assume by now that people on the newsgroup are avid players who enjoy the
game.  I am considering getting into it.  My only other experience with
MMORPG is one month of Star Wars: Galaxies.  While the game was interesting
it was repetitive, boring, and time consuming.  So, I have a couple
hesitations and questions.

How does EQ compare to SWG?
How are noobs treated on EQ?
How mindless and tedious is gameplay?
Does EQ compare at all to Neverwinter, Baulder's Gate, or Icewind Dale?
Does the game favor hack and slash or roleplay?

Any help would be appreciated.  The cost of the software is hardly anything
but I don't want to get my hopes up.
