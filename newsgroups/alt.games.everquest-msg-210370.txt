I can only assume that was the idea too...The first red player I met wanted
me to port him back to GFay and then got quiet abusive when I tried to
explain I couldn't...don't think english was his first language to be fair
so he may have not understood what I meant, anyway he was offering me a dual
in tells...I did contemplate this then realised I was only giving it a
second thought because I knew I would win...so left him alone...
Don't think I've seen red player that wasn't a mule since...I actually
thought they did this so their name stood out in the bazaar, making them
easy to find but someone mentioned that ppl were getting levitated and
bounced to the arena, apparently /shrug.

My ignore list would fill too fast on any zek server, dick waving (or smack
talk as the alt FoH page would call it) is not really my thing.
Although it does seem that some ppl just play PVP for the challenge rather
than to kill others...I can't say I stuck around more than 7 or 8 lvls on
any zek server.

Me neither, although a lot of ex Quake(2) players I knew that moved to EQ
joined Zek servers (wouldn't say all) and there is a, less than flattering,
view that all PvP'rs are failed Quake players...Not sure how much fact there
is in that but the /ooc and /shout channels could easily be taken off of any
public FPS server.

Well don't hold your breath for 65...As I have no real intention of getting
any of my mains to that level I don't see this SK making it much past 50 :�)
But yes I am full aware I have forgone all hope of ever being buffed or
healed again...As for unrez'd deaths, I take those anyway, always have.
I do worry about corpse loss tho...I don't intend on turning my Necro red
and I'm not 100% sure when SK's get full summon corpse but I have an idea
it's some 20 levels from where I am now and in 2 levels time I won't be able
to summon my own anymore.

> Look forward to hearing more about your SK's exploits.

Well if anything interesting happens I'll let post it...such as I ever run
into another Red player :�)
