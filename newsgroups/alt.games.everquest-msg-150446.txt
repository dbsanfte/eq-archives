I almost *lost* to a Dry Bones Skeleton in Oasis today.  I'm a 55 Wizard,
and I was at 60% mana, so that is very embarassing. :-)

I was running along, and some Gnome passed going the other way, being chased
by a Dry Bones.  The DB decided to attack me, so I rooted it, and went to go
med.  Whenever root would break, I would reroot.

I noticed that when root would break, the DB was not running toward me, but
rather running off at an angle.  So, I thought, perhaps the Gnome came back,
and the DB is after him again.  Or, it could just be the lousy pathing.  I
root the DB again, and move a close enough for /assist to work, to see who
it is after.  It is after me, so I click it, and nuke it.  It does not die,
which I think odd--I thought they were low enough that my standard nuke
would do them at once.  Oh well, nuke again.

It still lives!

Nuke a third time--and then notice that *I* am getting hit by a torrent of
something.  Look at target bar--WTF!?  It says "Adaael", not "dry bones
skeleton".  And *I* am Adaael.  Look at my health bar.  There is a little
bit of life left.

I root the DB once more, expecting the occasional hit of 10 it gets on me to
kill me, and start running for NRo.  About half way there, I decide that it
is too risky, and gate out.

I wasn't actually as bad off as I thought, since my normal buffed HP are
around 1100, so that little sliver of life was actually about 60 HP.

Still, that is cutting it way close.  My nuke does ~670 damage to mobs, so
two of them *could* have killed me.  However, I only hit myself for
200-something, and two for 400-something.
