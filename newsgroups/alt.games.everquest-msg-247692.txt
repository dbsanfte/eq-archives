   I dunno.  Do the baristas in Starbuck's wear leather bustiers on their
appointed rounds?  If so, then I guess the mystery of Starbuck's popularity
is explained.

   No no no.  AFAIK,  SB's just has that nasty Chai stuff they pass off as
tea.  Tea doesn't need help from cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Tea has a
delightful natural taste that doesn't need to be masked by even lemon.

   Tea... ok... don't get me started on tea.  There is a reason I chose
that as my moniker.  I probably account for about a third of the tea market
in North America.  

   But about your comment.. it's the glasses, right?  Those make my avatar
look like she counts her tips between strolling to class in her flats.  I
*like* the glasses.
