Friends of mine regularly double in the 500s .Thats both sks and pallies .
High end equipped knights do about 70-80% the dammage of a warrior. Its not
great but it certainly does count. They usually do a whole hell of alot more
dammage then any of the casters when parsed. The flowing thought items make
a diffrence but casters are still WAY behind the dammage curve.
