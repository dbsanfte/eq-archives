As I recall, yard trash in PoI is about lvl 52-55.  An enchanter with GoK 
can keep it locked down easily (did so on my enchanter at 54).  I'd say 
about 25-33% of the mobs are immune to lulls.  Most of the mobs spawn in 
pairs that are far enough away from the next pair that you won't need to 
lull those as well.  I'd say it's pretty rare that both mobs in a pair are 
lull immune.  The pally, bard or cleric should be able to lull.  If you get 
a mob that's not lullable, try the other mob in the pair and do some 
creative pulling :)

Things to really watch out for are archaic models, which are slow immune.  
You'll want to go all out DPS on them since they don't have many hit 
points.

This is all based on PC servers, so YMMV.

HTH and good luck :)
