Hmmm ... no answer to my last Mr Sisson .. perhaps you would consider
this information as well.  As gleaned from my newsreader XanaNews which
allows you to gather statistics on newgroups.

I took the Remington Stone method of calculating newsgroups as top
posters or not and worked on the one that most people visited in our
thread alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.abit (probably because it was on the
top of my top posting newsgroups that I inhabit list.

The following is a direct dump from my newsreader XanaNews with
annotations alongside each of the posters in the group as to whether
they top or bottom/context post.  You will note that if they post both
ways I made them bottom posters (probably statistically not correct I
should have scrubbed them).  Apologies for the size of the font this is
how they resolved from clipboard.  The thread count is low, for this
group,  but this is the number that was held on my news server at the
time I took the sample.

Interestingly under the Remington Stone method of calculating whether a
newsgroup is top posting (ie you count the numbers of posters not
posts), the total comes out to 57 top posts, 32 bottom/context posts
and 10 questions unanswered.

Guess I will still be called a liar though.  I hate being called a liar
more than anything else.

You can swear now Mr Sisson.
