My official laugh-at-the-enchanters post on this thread. JEWELCRAFT IS
NOTHING! It is cheap to raise! You can actually sell some of the items
created! Hell, at the high end stuff, you can sell the completed jewelry to
a vendor for MORE THAN THE COMPONENTS...no other trade skill allows for
that.

I get long hard laughs when I see enchanters whining and bitching "It took
me 8k platinum to reach 250 jewelcraft! WAAAAAH"...try spending 23k on
alchemy and still not being maxxed.
