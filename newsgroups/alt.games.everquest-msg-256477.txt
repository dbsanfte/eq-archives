The focus item for earth is nearly worthless - just some stat increases 
and no HP.  Focused Water has the HP of earth and no annoying root.  I
only used earth in my 50's waiting for my airpet. 

As far as which is better - firepets resulted in less downtime for me. 
Their DS is pet level + 1, so my 49th level fire pet had a 42pt DS. 
They could literally solo low DB mobs like bloodgills in LoIO - 2 at a
time. Of course, back then I needed to do 51% of the damage - that was
the limiting factor on how fast I could kill them.  I did 49 in 4 hours
and 50 in 4 hours there.  Add in to that that I didn't have the extra
600hp from items and 800hp from a temp.  With those, I think the firepet
is a far better solo pet than water these days. 

Also, remember that when pulling, Malaise/Malosi have incredibly low
aggro. The pet pulls it off you immediately (plus it's debuffed and
ready for nukes)  Additionally it allows you to single pull in spots
where nukes get 2 or more (The Hole).
