Definately the cleric epic... because its a great epic, so every cleric wants
it, every guild is willing to push for it... and there's a bottleneck mob
blocking the way.  My druid friends are getting their epics right and left,
while not one cleric I know personally has theirs or is within -months- of
getting it.

Can't exactly complain about the item itself, of course...
