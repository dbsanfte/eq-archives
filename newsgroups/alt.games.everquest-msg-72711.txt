Well what do you know, no only another one from Morell Thule, but one
of my fletching clientel to boot!  How you doing big guy?!!!

THe largest Cripple I have ever heard of was from a friend of mine.
He had an Oggok Cleaver and did a Crit for 321 in a group while in
SolB and another person in his group also had one on his main and did
a cripple for 601 with it.  That is certainly a hit that will wake you
up and then put you to sleep=)
