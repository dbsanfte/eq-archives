 Alright, your back out of the KF... but seriously consider this analogy...
 
 A group of people gather after work in a tavern everyday. Many have been
coming there for many, many years and have a history with each other.
they all know each other. Bought each other drinks many time, joked around
a lot, argued, maybe even had fist fights a few times. A new guy comes in 
one day and immediately starts trouble. He gets unceremoniously tossed out 
on the sidewalk and told not to return.
 
 Another day, one of the regulars whom all the other regulars knows has 
a bad day or has a bit too much to drink and starts the same sort of 
trouble. They are much less likely to toss that guy out and told not to 
return because they all know him and know that he's just had a bad day. 
Next day he comes in and apologizes to his friends and everything is ok. 
Does this sound reasonable? It should. It's the way humans will interact
anywhere in the world.
 
 Same thing will happen here. No difference. Nobody knows ya, you make 
a scene, you're going to get the boot. Simple psychology.
