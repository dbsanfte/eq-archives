> What city do you prefer and why?

Only tried one good character so far and Qeynos definately looked cheerier. 
All my other characters are Freeportians and the scenery isn't that bad, and 
I especially like the simple layout of Beggers Court which is my home as a 
Half Elf.

I tried a Ratonga but there home town was confusing to navigate and I did 
not like it at all. I like the simple layout of West Freeport with it's one 
major road curving around, but I still need the map to navigate the other 
Freeport zones.

Outside in the Commonlands is nice and easy to navigate around so overall I 
am happy with my lot in Freeport, especially since I get to be Assasin 
instead of some prancing fairy Ranger. ;-)
