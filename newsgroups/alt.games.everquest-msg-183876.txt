So you are agreeing with my assessment that there is little skill
involved in playing EQ?  Don't get me wrong, I think that feature
one of the game's strong points.  Knowledge of minutia and either
good tactical sense or the ability to effectively follow the lead
of somebody else seem to be the keys to playing the game well.  As
opposed to, say, tennis, where the mental aspects of the game are
not unimportant, but they are easily overwhelmed by comparatively
small differences in physical skills and so become more of an "all
other things being equal" sort of factor.
