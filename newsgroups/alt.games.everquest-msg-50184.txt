Did that once. 

My second run at Maggok it was actually much more fun to find a
non-twinked level 2 druid, buff the bewowzers out of her (Rune, Haste,
Str.. everything I had) and then pay her 20p to take the faction hit. She
got mass exp (yellow to her), a mountain of cash for a level 2, and fun
and excitement trying to slaughter a little tiny fish before the paladins
caught us. (which they promptly did ;-)

FYI to the original poster, if you're an enchanter, why on Norrath are you
worried about faction? Illusion Gnome+Alliace will get you any quest in
Ak'Anon you want.
