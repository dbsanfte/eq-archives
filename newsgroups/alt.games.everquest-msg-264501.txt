Another way of thinking about it is that FilePlanet deals with *a lot* 
of files which take forever to download on the non-subscription service, 
so along with being able to get those without waiting, they're also 
eligable for the numerous other Beta schemes FP runs (for instance the 
recent Beta of Ultima Online's new expansion).

So if they only signed up for it for the EQ2 beta and didn't get it, 
that's a bit sad (especially with the much rumoured release date of mid 
Nov approaching) but then there are so many other perks to it that 
hopefully they'll figure that out :-)
