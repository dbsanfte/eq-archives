Just find a very secluded place and do it when less people are on.
Sure it takes a bit more work but I have never had a problem doing it
this way. Sure there is a risk but so far I hav not had any problems.
The brew barrel thing is new to be, i'd be curious to try it, but I
have to imagine people would be checking them left and right.


As far as the $$$ thing goes it does suck, now I just have my druid do
all the buying and selling than drop items off for other characters.
