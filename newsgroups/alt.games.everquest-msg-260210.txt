One thing you can do is choose to ignore those web sites.  That's what a
friend and I did with CoH, the Trials of Atlantis DAoC expansion, and will
do with WoW and EQ2.

With EQ, we did the "visit all web sites/forums/newsgroups" thing, and he
did the "join an uberguild and race to do server-wide or even game-wide
firsts" thing.  With DAoC, we did the "web/forums/newsgroup" thing, but not
the racing to be first stuff.

For CoH, the only times I've gone to the web are when I'm trying to decide
on a new power.  I'll go check the class forums a bit to see how people are
using the various powers I'm considering.

With Trials of Atlantis, I did have to give in and buy the Prima guide,
because for some reason, that expansion just confuses me.  Unfortunately, so
does the Prima guide.  (I know that generally people consider Prima guides
to suck, and so are probably wondering how I could even think it might
help...but I have their DAoC Atlas, and that is awesome...it is like the
best of the map, mob, loot, and leveling guide web sites distilled into a
handy book, so I was hoping they might repeat that goodness).
