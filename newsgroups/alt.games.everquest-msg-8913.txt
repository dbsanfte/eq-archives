I am sure the formula is pretty complicated unless someone
hacked Verant to find it, or did a very detailed analysis of
many many battles.

I do know that AC is a combination of the AC from
armor(known as hard AC) and that from Agility(known
as soft AC.

From the official word about Agility:

AGI: Affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult
it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit.


From playing the game and my experience I can say
the following:

1. Hard AC from armor is better than soft AC from agility
although both are important. Always choose an armor piece
based on its AC not its ability bonuses if you are a melee
class. Serpentine bracers are crap.

2. The is a rear AC penalty in EQ, you WILL get hit harder
and more often if something is beating on your back. Also
your character cannot riposte/block/dodge/parry rear attacks.
Always keep all your opponents in front of you.

3. Multiple opponents seem to lower your armor class. I can
fight a particular type of monster, say a blue goblin, one on one
and kick its ass. But if I fight 2 of the same goblin and same level
its not I get double damage from them but more like triple or
quadruple damage! This is why I think hordes of green aggros are
still so dangerous, there seems to be a 'gang up' factor involved.
