I had a similar problem with my cable modem.

I eventually tracked it down to the firewall program.

Because a new copy of everquest.exe had been loaded with the patch
the firewall had no rule to govern what to do with this program.

As soonas I replaced the old everquest.exe , with the new copy in the
firewall list
everything worked fine.
