Ghu, I *thought* it would, but fully buffed out, and with all my disease 
and poison resist chachkas on I can be at 190+ and I still get hit=\

I have several sets of stat/resist chachkas I swap out depending on 
which resists and what boosts I need, so I can manipulate my stats 
fairly well. I am always on the lookout for good toys=) I am already 
wearing the spaulders but i am hesitant to swap my amulet of insight or 
crystalline torque for the broach as a neck item=\ I like the extended 
enhancement on buffs, and the mana pres 3...not sure i want to give 
either of those up. Item effect balancing when you arent in a raid guild 
can be problematic as many of the focus items I want are not available 
to me without a raid=\ and I don't have serious plat.

Though I did just get the fabled mithril BP friday night, I am one item 
closer to end game gear=) as I noticed a lot of 65s lined up for the BP...
