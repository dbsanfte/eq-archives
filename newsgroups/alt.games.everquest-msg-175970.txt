The huge payday seems to come from plague rat tails. They sell to
vendors for over a plat each. Been too long for me to remember if there
are rats in the Nek newbie zone or not. If not, if may be worth the OP's
time to make the trip to the Painell newbie area to hunt for a level or
so. (Aren't dark elves non-KOS to the Paineel guards by default? Dont'
remember) Either way, get a bind down near the pool by the Hole (no mobs
there) and kill every rat you find in the newbie garden. Save up all the
plauge rat tails you can carry, and trash the rest of the loot. When you
go back home, sell off your tails to a vendor and you'll have more than
enough money for your needed bags, and probably some left over to boot.
