You are not the only one with the problem, EQ has been designed to keep
people from runnning programs to exploit the game, so there are ALOT of
active this EQ is doing to prevent this on both server and client side.

More RAM will help loading of zones, turning on caches helps too, you pay
for it when you initally load the game, but zoning times are noticeably
lower. I think you have the storage mixed with memory...32-bit Intel chips
and the like can only address 4 Gigs of RAM, i think the 28 Gigs in Hardrive
space. Memory DOES NOT EQUAL storage.

No e-mail for you! EQ has you, who needs e-mail anyways?
