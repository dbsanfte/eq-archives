Why did you get a 3 gig?  I've found that it is almost never worth getting
the fastest CPU.  The gains over slower CPUs are not very large, but the
cost is way more.  Consider the following.  I'll take the cheapest price
for an OEM version at pricewatch for the 3 gig, and I'll take the rest of
the prices from www.newegg.com.  I'm picking newegg because they have one of
the highest ratings at www.resellerratings.com, based on a huge amount of
feedback.  The low prices at pricewatch are often from places that you have
to love gambling to buy from (although the place with the lowest price in
this case looks pretty good, based on the feedback at resellerratings).

All are 533 MHz FSB.

    3.06,   $650    OEM
    2.8     $383    Retail (e.g., with fan and heatsink)
    2.66    $300    Retail
    2.53    $235    Retail
    2.4     $190    Retail

Here's another way to look at this data:

    step        speed jump      price jump 
2.8 -> 3.06     9.3%            70%
2.66 -> 2.8     5.3%            28%
2.53 -> 2.66    5.1%            28%
2.4 -> 2.53     5.4%            24%

(Note that this is speed jump of the CPU only.  You won't get an overall
system performance boost of anywhere near that high, since everything else
is running at the same speed).

You will come out way ahead in the long run if you buy just enough CPU to
play the games you are playing now, and will be playing for the next few
months.  I'm putting together my new gaming system, and I'm going with the
2.4.  If a game comes out six months from now that won't play well on a 2.4,
but would play well on a 3.06, I'll buy a 3.06 and pop it in (the
motherboard I'm getting can handle the 3.06), and my $190 + whatever the
3.06 will be in six months will still come out less than a 3.06 *now*.

So, my recommendation to people putting together gaming systems is:

1. Best video card you can afford.

2. Motherboard that can handle the fastest CPU available.

3. CPU that is fast enough for the current games and the games you expect to
come out in the next fix months.
