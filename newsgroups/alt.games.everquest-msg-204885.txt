Yes ... a huge part of the game is missing, the excitement of looting
a good item, or even the possibility however rare of getting an item
from a monster is missing. You know that when you loot a monster all
your going to get is money and maybe some standard armour (which is
just money too). The items that do drop, a level 35 mob drops an item
for an under level 20 character. Makes fighting monsters boring and
repetitive, it's just a job I have to do to make money.
