I don't even try to explain why anymore when someone is obviously trying to
use me to PL them or are rude about asking for buffs....I just say "no"  :-)

Btw, I am a halfling druid and I never charge for SoW or Heals or porting
for CR.  I am based out of FV zone and always give free Sow and Camo to
those making the trek to LOIO.
