With only a couple weeks played, you might want to wait a bit. Find out the
reputations of the guilds on your server, how social they are, how often
they expect you to raid. Also, most guild have a level requirement; mine
would be considered a newbie guild by most in this group, but we still have
a min level of 15.

After another 10 levels you might want to consider a guild. By then you will
have grouped with a large range of players, some of whom may be in the type
of guild you're looking for.
