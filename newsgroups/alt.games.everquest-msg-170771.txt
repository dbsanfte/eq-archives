}I think in many ways, the welfare system itself creates the problem.  Take a
}man with two kids and a menial job.  He gets laid off because his company
}goes under, and starts collecting a check while he takes inventory and looks
}for a new job.  Problem is, he may quickly find that he can't afford to lose
}the government benefits by working.  Now, he's in a situation where he can
}go to work and take a paycut, or stay on welfare and provide for his family.

The problem with this particular theory is that unless he's going to a 
minimum-wage job for less than 20 hours a week, he's not going to be 
taking a pay cut (directly).  The main problem arises in single-parent 
situations, as I see it.  If the single parent gets a reasonable job, in 
all probablility, paycheck > welfare payment.  But in many cases, paycheck 
minus alternate childcare expenses < welfare payment, and in fact very 
close to zero.  

}That goes even farther when you consider a single mother who also has to
}face the fact that her welfare goes down (or away entirely) if she marries.

And this is precisely why I was never legally married.  Well, ok, part of 
it.  The other part being that it would suddenly make me liable for my 
ex-wife's child's $2,000,000.00 medical bill from the day of his birth in 
Minnesota.  Shortly after we broke up, they finally caught up with his 
deadbeat, paid under the table, knife-wielding psycho, mink farmer, dad.  
Ha!  So last I checked my ex-wife actually has a good job now.

Needless to say, she -couldn't- get a job.  Her wages would have been -so- 
garnished.  But you can't do that to welfare payments.  You see, 
sometimes, life just isn't fair.  Amniotic Band Syndrome is particularly 
very not fair.  Having your fate tied to the behaviour of a 
responsibility-evading moron is also very not fair.  And I can't say that 
being punished by the state for having had lousy taste in men would be 
particularly fair either.

}The real tragedy, however, is when the children have grown up in a
}welfare-provided home.  They have been raised on an attitude of victimology
}and entitlement.  It takes a strong person to cast that aside and become a
}useful member of society, it's all they've known.

Strangely, a lot of the strongest opponents of welfare I've met have 
grown up in such homes.  It's sort of like how alcoholism tends to skip a 
generation.

}Even if someone believes that welfare is a good idea in theory, they must
}agree that the current system is destructive to the nation and to the
}recipient.

The phrase 'they must agree' worries me.  You're making a rather large 
assumption about the mental processes of a very diverse group of people 
there.  That said, I'd personally agree that the current system needs some 
major tweaking.  But I do think the current system is better than no 
welfare at all, and hence not 'destructive to the nation and recipient'.

}We need to impliment a system where welfare only acts to raise
}_working_ families above a certain level, and decays as the family income
}rises (say, .50$ for every $1 increase in monthly pay, that way they do get
}the benefit of the raise, while still being slowly taken off the dole).
}This would help to support the poor family, while still allowing them the
}sense of purpose and self that comes with being a useful member of society.

That simply won't work.  It's way too easy to become completely sunk in 
debt if you lose a job for more than a month or two, and frequently takes 
longer than that to find a replacement job.  I do think your 'decay as 
rises' system might be good, and might help ameliorate the childcare 
situation I mentioned above considerably.  But I think that totally 
cutting off those with -no- means of support who most need a safety 
net would be a major mistake.  Perhaps if it decayed over time, as well as 
over increasing wage...?  Perhaps if it subsidized daycare in the event of 
a new job requiring it...?

I also think, though, that these ideas would be making an already 
complicated system even more complicated.  And the degree to which a 
system can be exploited by the unscrupulous seems to be directly 
proportional to how complicated it is... But it could be worth a try.
