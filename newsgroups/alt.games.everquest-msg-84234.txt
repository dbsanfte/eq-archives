As a mage I have to agree :)

The main reason mages are nerfed 50+ (well, 55+ more) is because they
suddenly turn into a utility class instead of the pure-offense they were the
previous 50 levels. And the whole basis on that idea is modrods and CoH.

Dump CoH & modrod, give our lvl 60 nuke 200 damage more (like all other
classes' nukes scale), un-nerf rainspell resists and up the level of the 50+
pets (level or att. as long as it can hit 55+ mobs decently unlike now.
Damage per hit and nukes / BS are fine now).

/magerant off

oh
/magerant on
keep the modrods but make them self only or such, to compensate for the
other changes.
And before I get rants for that: every other caster class has at least some
way to regain mana faster
