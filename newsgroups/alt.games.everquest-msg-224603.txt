    Eventually you get used to them and clear them in a fair amount less
than the 1 hour maximum.

    And rothounds that have returned to active raiding because their
computer has miraculously been fixed.

    We had a rule on the fire focus mask, but that was it. Really, you will
eventually get all of the phase 1 loot you could want and more.

    My rule: if it has +ATK, I don't ask for it. Ever. I'm going to have a
Heiro Cloak when the next expansion starts because of this policy (damn +ATK
added to the Platinum Cloak of War), but that's how I feel.

    Then they should have read up on what the foci do. I'm amazed that
people still ask in guildchat what various effects do when items drop.
Hello, there's been a full Time loot spoiler out for months now. Take an
hour, read the damn thing with Lucy open in a second window, decide what
items you'd be interested in, and wait for them to drop. Plan ahead!

    It was a silly incident. Get over it. Forget the mage even exists.

    /cringe. Well, it worked for you, so I can't really criticize. But ick.
By the way... if one were to look in Lucy at one of the AE's that Terris
used (on Live), then if one were to look at the day the AE in question was
created in History, then if one were to look at the list of all changes to
Lucy on that date, one might find a large number of scary AE's, procs, and
self-buffs. If one were to think about it, I bet one could match those
effects to a certain set of mobs in a place of interest. I bet it could
really help one with things like planning strategies ahead of time, so one
didn't waste valuable rotation time learning what could be learned earlier.

    The blue vortex in each god's area ports you to that god's home plane.

    No Radiant Cure III? No resist buffs for the appropriate resist?

    No crowd control, offtanking, killing adds then returning to Terris? You
guys really better return to the drawing board and get good at things like
that, because if you aren't later gods will have their way with you.

    Any cleric with both elemental arms and the Solusek Ro cloak should be
all over those things. 4% Spell Shield is a great effect to have, and the
Faerune allows you to upgrade your elemental hat when upgrades to that
appear. To put this in perspective: that AE from Solusek Ro, the one the CH
team eats? With those arms and Bulwark of Vie, you go from 3000 damage to
2580 damage. You can pretty much cure that with Celestial Regen and
druid/shaman regen, without ever needing outside heals or group heals. It
stacks, too - as you get more Spell Shield items, you take less damage.

    Ok, here's the deal. The next day, have an officer who was in the raid
all night be the first person to click over to Time-B. That way, your
instance will be preserved. Any time you get to phase IV or higher, your
progress is saved. So when you zone over, you'll have to kill phase one
(with loot), but after that everything will be clear to phase IV, and Terris
won't be up. If someone else clicks that wasn't there before, people either
won't be able to zone over or worse - your instance will get lost and you'll
have to fight through phase one, two and three (PHs and no loot in II and
III) to get to phase IV again. When you get to phase IV, you'll have one
hour per god left standing. So since you killed one god, when you go tonight
you'll have three hours.

    Could be worse. In phase V, we had a person get feared into Cazic
Thule's portal (CT had already died). Yup, you guessed it - ported into a
full pop Plane of Fear.

    The high-number ones are amazingly easy. I find almost half of the mobs
encountered drop what you need, so total mobs killed is now on a par with
slaughter.
