Yeah but you didn't answer my question. :)   Thanks for the info.  The
answers are:  No, there's no reason I should know him; and no, there's no
reason I should give a shit.

I've been playing for 3.5 years and FoH has not influenced or affected my
play in any way whatsoever (besides reporting or finding exploits and/or
bugs that Verant fixed before I could get to a point where I'd be doing that
stuff).  Lots of people neither know or care, so hopefully they don't take
themselves too seriously (at best they're just beta testers *yawn*).

No, Kaev, I don't think I was being facetious if you were implying that I
knew who he was.
