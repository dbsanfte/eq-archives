At level four, I'm sad to say, you aren't going to see squat for money. Yes,
there are some tradeskills you can take up, but the money will still be very
meager and you can bore yourself to tears and/or get carpal tunnel.  You could
try fishing, I guess. Poles are fairly cheap (you should have a couple gold by
now) and bait is only a few copper and you can sell the fish back for a couple
silver, I think. Plus it's free food.
  Speaking of free food, don't buy any food till level 5.  Just let yourself
get killed near your spawn point. Voila! Instant food/drink refill and you
don't lose any xp at that level.
 But for the most part, just get out there and start killing everything that
moves, loot the bodies, and sell whatever you find (and can't use) to the
merchants. The money will come later.
