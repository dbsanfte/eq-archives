One of the stronger bard tactics is to twist dots on a mob
while running it in circles.  Since there is no mana involved,
if a little care is used this inevitably results in the death
of the mob and a bard fully ready to pull the next.

Unfortunately, it can be quite time consuming, which
means I don't use it much for exp work; its good for
killing that one hard mob, and certainly for finishing
off leftovers from a swarm, but mobs per minute
rate really isn't too good.

Thinking about this recently, though, part of the problem
is clear; the kiting nerf at work.  When a mob is moving
towards its target, it takes only 2/3rds damage from DOTs.

Are there any bard usable root items?  Fear kiting
would also mean a 2/3rds reduction in DOT... as I'd have
to leave out a DOT to keep fear up.  Hmm, there's always
Instill Doubt (doubles over with laughter at the thought of
relying on this once-in-a-blue-moon ability)


Course at my level I really only have two useful DOTs
but I'm still not planning to stay close enough to the mob
for AOE fear refreshing
