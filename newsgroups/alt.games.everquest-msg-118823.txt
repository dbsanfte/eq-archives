How do most players treat their pets?  I sometimes feel as if I'm treating
mine more like a slave than a pet or partner.  There is no way anyone would
last in a group long if they treated their groupmate the way they treat
their summoned groupmate.

My pet solos while I med, only so I can stand up and loot the corpse, find
another target for him to attack, sit and med more.

I fight one while he fights another.  He seems to be stronger, though lower
level, so I let him fight the stronger mob.  He hits harder so he often
kills his mob first.  I then let him finish off mine while I loot the corpse
of the one he just killed, then proceed to ninja-loot the corpse of the mob
I was supposed to solo, then turned over to him.

If things are getting dangerous, I run like a coward (better a live coward
than a dead warrior), leaving him to die and give me a head start on running
away.

When pulling, I either send him to the mob, keeping me at a safe distance,
or engage through debuff or damage spell, then send him to stop the mob from
reaching me.  This way if it's a bad pull, well..."sucks to be him!", and
again, the above mentioned LIVING coward act.

If he happens to be too low, or acting too weak for my likings, then rather
then disband him from my presence, I'll use HIM as my pulling tactic,
letting him die fighting a yellow con, taking the damage, while I sit at a
safe distance and attack with magic.

Am I cruel, insane, psychotic, or just the average player?
(By the way, I don't have pets in real life.)
