 Depends on the situation. Some mobs can't be split without spending too
much time at it (Aaryonar and his two pets although I think now that's
changed). Other times if I know we have the force, I wont bother to try
splitting them (Also Aary and his two pets). Just because you have a
Monk pulling doesn't mean you have to only get one mob at a time.
