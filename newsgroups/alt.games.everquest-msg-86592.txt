I set mine to 10% at 51. I have a couple friends that set theres at 100% in
51 or 52 so that they can stick around for naggy/voxx raids. Plus they are
tanks and wanted regen and run - they still solo with their tanks, Ogre tank
with fungi tunic cloroplast and regen skill is pretty awesome for soloing I
guess.

If I was a necro/shaman I would be wanting some regen skill ASAP for the
mana boost it would give.
