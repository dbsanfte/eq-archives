Yup, RV is #1 on the "my god, get the hell away from me, you fucking
beggars" list.

I was in there one night, did a / (shortcut for /who) and saw there were 3
people in the zone, my 52 enc, my friend's 52 dru, and a 46 dru.  I sent an
/ooc saying something like "OMG, the first time I've been in this town and
there hasn't been any beggars!"  The 46 dru went ahead & begged from me,
just to prove me wrong. :)
