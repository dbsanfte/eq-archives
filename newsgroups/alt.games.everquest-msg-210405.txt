For increasing melee damage, the weapons dmg stat has to be more than
half of what the pet hits for max unarmed. However, if the weapon has
a proc that the pet is high enough level to use, then it's still worth
arming the pet. Other stats and abilities such as AC or +HP will also
be granted to the pet from the weapon (or armor even). So, increasing
melee damage isn't the only reason to arm a pet.

Also, the level 29 and 34 pets have to be equipped with two weapons to
be able to use their dual wield skill. At 39, they should start
swinging their offhand even if they're not armed.
