He's naive? A customer that cancels before complaining is not going to
be a return customer, especially at such a small issue.

Also, no insult was present. The account was canceled. The issue was
no longer present. Thus, ticket closed. Move on to the *CURRENT*
*PAYING* customers' issues rather than the one who took his toys and
left.
