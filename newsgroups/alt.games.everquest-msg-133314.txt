So, when are you going to demand that your ISP carry each and every
newsgroup?  After all, they may not be carrying some for political reasons.

Not good at reading threads, are you?  You know that wasn't what that was a
response to.

I may have to power to do that, but that's not the route I'm choosing to
take.  If you don't like that, gee, that's too bad.  Maybe if you weren't so
busy trying to protect freedoms that aren't even being put at risk, you
would see that it's not a big deal.  If nothing, you've convinced me that
I'm doing the right thing.  If your little flames, and cute attempts at
intimidation are the best you can do to counter my objection, then your
point of view must be from very shakey ground.
