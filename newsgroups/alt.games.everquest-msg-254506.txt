The best resource, I find, is in game. Most people in PoK or the Bazaar
aren't actively engaged in anything and may well take 5-10 minutes out of
their game to answer a few questions. If you are in your teens, ask someone
in their 30's what they've been using. Ask a level 65, and he might remember
:-) Ask if they were twinked or not - no point in lusting over a 10kpp sword
if you've got 60pp in the bank.

Bear in mind that you could get to 50 originally in the old world, and that
bronze/banded/cured silk was adequate. It's hard to avoid gear envy, but
better gear doesn't automatically equate to a better player.

This NG is also an excellent resource, but remember to take a large dose of
salt for the posts that go along the lines of "if you're not lvl 65 with
epic and 100 AAs in 3 days played with 200kpp in the bank then you suck and
should go back to solitaire" :-)
