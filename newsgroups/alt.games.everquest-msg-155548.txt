    You forgot the part where PotG doesn't stack with a cleric's HP/AC
buffs, including Aegolism. When you combine buffs, you can have
Khura's/PotG/Symbol of Marzin/Bulwark of Faith, or Aegolism/BAotR. One
requires me to bug other people for two buffs, the other I do all by myself.
One takes four buff slots, the other takes two. There's also Ancient
versions of both Aegolism and BAotR which IIRC give equal or greater HPs
than the four-buff combo. Did I mention Symbol of Marzin fades in under an
hour, versus the two and a half hours on Aegolism and BAotR?

    Now there are fights where you want PotG instead of Aegolism, and
buffing the clerics that always forget to click off BAotR for AoE PotG is a
pain. But this seems like a silly change if it's just been done for the
benefit of AFK and/or clueless clerics.
