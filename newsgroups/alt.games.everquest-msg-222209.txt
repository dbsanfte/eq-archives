When you compare the way SoE implemented dynamic dungeons to the way
other games have you begin to see how backwards LDoN is. All I can say
is I feel for you and its causing a lot of people frustration. LDoN
was it for me haven't logged back on since my last attempt at having
some fun weeks ago. 

Spend a week with AO  (not saying its a better game only an example of
the way dynamic dungeons should be)  and you begin to wonder what they
were thinking about in LDoN. The lack of Solo or even Duo and Trio
missions(adventures) is a crime. Unfortunately grouping just flat
sucks and EQ makes it worse than needs to be with LDoN.
