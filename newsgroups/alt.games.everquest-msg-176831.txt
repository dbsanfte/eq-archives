The "POP Alert" window that pops up when you check the box to delete
messages off the server after download.  It warns the user that all
their read mail will be deleted.  And as far as I know, the default
setting is to leave mail on the server forever.  This *could* have
changed in Jaguar.  I'll have to double check that.

The Junk Mail filtering in Mozilla 1.3 (I think it made it for the
cutoff) is pretty incredible by all reports.  I haven't had time to test
it, but I plan on it when things calm down a little at work. :-)

Don't get me wrong.  I love OS X.  The Mac Mail thing is the only thing
that annoys me so far.
