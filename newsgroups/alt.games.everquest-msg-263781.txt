Hrm.  Presumably in the same time you could instead 'grind out' a
level 7 in both?

My gut instinct said yeuchh, but on further consideration it's not
that bad.

Hrm.  If it's interactive enough to be a game in it's own right - ie
the possibility for the player to affect his character's
success/failure rate and speed thereof-  I'm all for it.  OTOH, if
it's just 'grinding' for levels with nice graphics and a time-delay,
I'll pass.

Sweeeeeeeeeeet.

Options would be nice;  say you're hit by Daydreaming: being able to
choose between "Snap Out Of It" to negate the effect quickly, or
taking a more risky approach that might let you finish faster or with
highter quality.  This would make it less of a 'pay attention and
follow the script' and more of a 'pay attention and play' effect.

Is something like that implemented, on the drawing board, or something
I should try to convince random betatesters to promote?

Having 'experiment' option as a high-risk answer to some of the
events, thereby allowing you to come up with your 'own' recipes, would
be way cool.  IMO, of course.  I could see it being appropriate to
either Daydreaming or Wrong Ingredients, maybe even Mislabeled
Ingredients (just with a higher risk of failure.)

Eh.  With the risk of dying in there, it doesn't seem (from an
outsider perspective at least) to be any worse than farming monsters
for profit.  Just make sure the risk for vendor-profit items is
appropriate to the profit.  

Ideally, a way to base the vendor-price off the playermarket price -
deflated, of course - would be perfect.  But I suspect that would be
somewhat difficult.

Hrm.  And this might create a psuedoniche for resource gatherers as
well.

What this needs - and I'm going off both my previous comment and my
past enjoyment of UO here - is an archetype geared towards resource
gathering.  Mining, Lumberjacking, Shepherding or the like, with
skills that increase the odds and/or reduce the time consumption..

I dislike the whole 'encourage muling' aspect you hint at there just
as much.

This is one of the areas I like skill-system designs better:  you can
lessen some of the dependency by choosing complimentary skillsets or
you can deal with the dependency in other ways and free up skillpoints
for something else - ie. choose self-sufficient focus, or
interdependant utility.
