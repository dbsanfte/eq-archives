What risk vs reward? Are you even in kt yet? Do you know every named in
there shares the same basic 8 or so item loot table, and the ikkinz
trial mobs basically share the same too?

Yay, more time added to an expansion where getting someplace is already
way more of a time sink than anywhere other than tov.

Easy to say when you're a class that can solo verix now. Maybe you've
forgotten how long the average drop of verix's piece is in kc basement.
I haven't. I sat with groups there trying to get people their pieces for
8+ hours without one verix spawn. Lots of fun when 4 or 5 people in the
group needed it.

Sure it does. Unless you like endless camping of key parts or have never
actually got an alt past 30. Again, as a necro, your perspective is
probably warped by being able to solo things for your alt other classes
need a group for.
