You won't be able to make any of the tier 2 planes, so I can pretty much
limit myself to responding about the three tier 1s.

The "yard trash" in Plane of Nightmare, Disease and Innovation all is around
level 47 or so.   It has a reasonable amount of hit points for it's level,
(not super high) but everything has a max hit that is well into the 300's at
least.  Compared to level 47's in say Sebilis or Chardok, which would have a
max hit of around 150 to 180(?).  The increased difficulty is compensated by
giving the entire zone an almost insane exp bonus.

As for when you could begin hunting there... If you have a regular group,
higher level friends or guildmates, your cleric could probably begin hunting
there now.  You would do ok, and CH is more dependent on the target than the
caster, really.  If you are relying on pickup groups, your cleric might be
able to get a group sometimes, but would often be passed over for other
higher leveled clerics until he gains a few more levels himself.

For your monk, (or really any class other than cleric) you could probably go
in a "friends" group in the mid / low 50's, but you're unlikely to get any
pickup groups at all prior to 56, and not regularly until 58 or so.  (From
what I've seen in the lfg shouts).


Perhaps this will change if some low 50's begin froming good groups and
moving in for the zone trash, while the 60's move down to the harder stuff,
(or finally make it past the Trial of Waiting in Endless Lines, and get to
another plane) but it has not happened yet.


As a side note, a friend who is a 54 Rogue joined our (mostly 61) hunting
group last night.   When he did so, our "safe" pull spot in Nightmare was no
longer safe.  Wanderers would aggro based on his level, and cross hills for
what seemed to be miles around to come kill him.
