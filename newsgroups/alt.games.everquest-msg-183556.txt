You rez another cleric before you die (they get the box but don't click it),
then when everybody is dead, and the monk/rogue says its safe, the cleric
then clicks "yes" and rezzes the raid.   When the raid is wiping and people
are dieing all around you, there isn't really much more time you can delay
before giving the cleric a box.

Commonly during a wipe, you try to at least kill as much of the train as you
can before you die... you *know* you're dieing - whats fm gonna do when
you're dead?   May as well kill some stuff, so the next pull is a mob or 2
less.... So you unload on mobx y and z while it kills more people (once the
clerics are dead you're just throwing bodies at it) before it eventually
kill's you.

This "resistance" could actually be harmful now, because from the minute a
cleric got a box the clock is ticking, its better to just click every buff
off, sit down, and die asap... the longer it takes to kill everybody, the
less chance you'r cleric can still rez in afterwards to save the day
