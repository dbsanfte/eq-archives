Primal is by no means the best weapons nor is kael armor the best armor.
Most primal weapons are 12 20 and proc a shamn type massive stat buff.

Monks get a 15 20 primal , sks and pallies get i think a 20 20 primal (but
are limited to one hand)

In contrast the best of monk drops ( the ones i know best since I have a
monk ) are the fist of lightning 15/18 41% haste off eashen of the sky,
wurmscale fistwraps 14/17off another ntov dragon, a 14 18 off the thought
overfiend in the deep and several mistake weapons that have crept in (3/8
,4/11 , etc. ) I have also seen some 45/'30 paladin sk weapons out there.

The advantage of primal and priceless is that it is fairly easy to get. 18
people is more than enough to easily handle nameds that drop primal and you
could can farm priceless with 6. The warders themselves are actually tough
fights and have great loot instead of just good loot and these warders are
removed entirely when the sleeper is woken on a server.
