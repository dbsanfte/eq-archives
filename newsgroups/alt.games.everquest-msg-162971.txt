Sadly, the existance of a 2 hour plus mana regen buff thats readily available
pretty much kills the usefulness of your C2.  This leaves you with a haste, and
now you have to compete with other chanters, bards, shaman, and beastlords for
the "haster" spot.

If you can also mez, charm and otherwise perform chanter duties, then your class
is still desirable, but for PoP zones you may have a lot of trouble using these
lines on anything tough.  If you stick to "yard trash" mobs then I can't think
why you wouldn't be perfectly useful, but you'll probably have to form the group
yourself.  I do see quite a few 55 to 59 people lfg in PoT (the group forming
zone), they are hoping, like you, to be picked up by a high level group to fill
a hole... however if you log in during a busy time, you might very well be able
to convince them to band together and do the easier stuff.

To easily get into PoP groups, you want level 60+
