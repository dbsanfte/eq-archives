I would think that it is a problem with Win95.  Both EQ and Optical mice
came after Win98's launch, so I would take a gamble as to say that might be
the culprit.  I have a Logitech Optical also running on a dual-boot 98/2000
box and have no problems.  One other thing...You might have a program
running in the background called something like EM_EXEC.  If it is running,
shut it off.  You will lose functionality off the scrolling wheel, but it
might be causing the problem.  This worked for me with Giants:Citizen
Kabuto.
I got a new Logitech Optical mouse and installed in on my system.  The mouse
works fine but not with EQ.  On the game screen, the text scroll bar
continuously move up.  This makes incoming text information hidden.  One can
scroll the text screen to the bottom manually to read the text, but as soon
as
one let the scroll handle go the handle just moves right to the top!

I talk to Logitech support and they told me to get a patch GAME_WHL.EXE to
fix
the problem.  But it didn't fix the problem.  I checked to see if the patch
worked by looking at the WINDOWS Registry.   It has, and changed
MouseHookDLLEnable=0.

Does anyone have answer to my problem?  My system is 233Mhz PC with WIN95
OS.
