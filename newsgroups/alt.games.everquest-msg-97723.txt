Jesus fucking Christ Ben, give it up!  Not everyone feels the same way 
that you do.  Some people LIKE the fact that certain things are hard in 
the game.  You just asked to find ONE person who doesn't think the 
spellbook is a bad idea, one showed up, now you call him an idiot, why?

You have completely forfeited any accrued goodwill with that comment.  You 
sound like a complete and utter moron now.  We all agree that most of what 
we're discussing is opinion, and then you flame someone for having a 
different opinion, AND THEN PLONK THEM?  <boggle>  Oh, by the way, how do 
you feel about the death penalty?  If you like it you must be a fucking 
retarded son of a crack-whore, since NOBODY could ever see anything good 
about losing EXP.
