Yes.   In what I consider "uber" gear (Ben might consider it "ok" gear) a
warrior will be pushing 1500+.   If you just substitute Kael quest amor for
Skyshrine quest armor, you're looking at 1300'ish right there.

Or at least they would be easily if AC had an effect.  The focus on HP and
Stamina means that the warrior usually won't bother to push it past 1300,
unless the AC gain is incidental with the better HP...

I find it a bit telling that when I heard of Furor (sp?)  bragging about his
warrior's gear on the serverwide warrior channel, he mentiond 6000 hp and
1350 atk unbuffed.... but didn't even bother mentioning the armor class.
Every tank has all they need.

Unless something has changed...  from what Sang posted a while ago, tests
and extensive parsing had shown that a 100 point increase in AC was about a
10% overall damage reduction, until you were over 1200, at which point you
get almost no further reduction.

You're still in the AC range where it is making a real difference.

*shrug*  I may be overestimating some, as the monks that raid with our
public raiding group (most of the monks that I deal with on a regular basis)
are the most twinked out class of people we have with us.  (Luclin was
*very* kind to the monks.   Almost every ubermob drops a ton of Monk / BL
only shit, thats better than anything a warrior can wear or wield)  I don't
think I'm overestimating by much though, if at all.

Might very well be.  At the very least, I think Ben has a valid point about
the problems caused by the trend in endgame armor to "All / All" eroding a
lot of the advantage that warriors had, while the weapons not following the
same path has preserved the other classes' advantages.


(Sorry if that came out jumbled, I'm a bit too tired at the moment to be
coherent)   Maybe I'll think about it some tomorrow, while I'm at work : P
