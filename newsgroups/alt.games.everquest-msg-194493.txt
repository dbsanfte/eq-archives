Well, it happened to me.

I put my trader on, went out, cam eout 10 hours later and my char was bare
naked in PoK (bind point). Went back to Nexus and summoned my corpse. I
could loot it, but I couldn't rez it anymore and I lost a severe amount of
exp. Of course I petitioned, but till now, no responce.

Any similar experiences? (this all happened on CT server.

Regards, Dirk
