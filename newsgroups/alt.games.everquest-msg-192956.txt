Get a sharpening stone (maybe several) and sharpen the rusty sword in
a forge (put sword and one stone in forge, press combine, if it works
you should get a tarnished [or was it sharpened in this case] sword
back, if not it will still be rusty, pay attention to the message in
the chat box). Go out and collect a large King snake skin and a gnoll
fang and take everything back to Pinewisper in SFG. Give him
everything (sword, skin, and fang) and get back the Pine Scout
Longsword.

It's a pretty good sword (6/27 with ST and AGI adds and magical).
