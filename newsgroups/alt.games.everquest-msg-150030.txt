The Darkness line is a snare, not a slow, with a DoT component.
Insidious Retrogression is a 560-point nuke snare. Use those, your pet
and lifetaps at a minimum. If you can coordinate with your clerics,
use Bond of Death / Pact of Shadows to do patch heals. Screaming
Terror is a good emergency mez/stun. You have the best Root
progression in the game. Oh, and keep twitch up.
