step 1: Do a command prompt only boot of windows, run scanreg /fix
step 1a: Pray something doesn't go fubar.
step 2: Find the motherboard chipset drivers for your MB. Install/reinstall
latest.
step 2a: Pray something doesn't go fubar.
step 3: Uninstall the catalyst drivers completely. Maybe see if there's a
cleaner on guru3d or something
step 4: reinstall the latest catalyst drivers
step 5: reinstall Direct X
step 6: Do a thorough file check in the patcher
step 7: Pray.
Also, check DxDiag out, see what it says.

'No 3d device found' is usually a corrupt system file, corrupt base driver
file, or a registry screwup.
Occasionally it's a bad call from the program (corrupt program file).

And can you go like, say, 2k? 98SE is so... 98.
At least it's not 'WinMe'
