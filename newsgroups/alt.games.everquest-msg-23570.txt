Well, I finally found the stout, at the tavern near the gate
that my rogue used to frequent, since they didn't hate him
so much as everyone else.  Sure, I'll sneak up behind
vendors selling weapons and supplies, but a halfling likes
a chat with his ale!

Now, though, I'm stuck finding Taldrik.. hired a ranger even,
no sign of him in Oasis.  Sure its Oasis?  Some kind of annoying
rare spawn?  Hunted to extinction?  Ranger just blind?
