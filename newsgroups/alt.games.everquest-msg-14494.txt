I just tried this last night, and as I expected, it does not
work.

[Tue Jun 12 01:05:46 2001] You no longer have a target.
[Tue Jun 12 01:05:49 2001] You say, 'Hail Manik Compolten'
[Tue Jun 12 01:05:49 2001] Manik Compolten says 'Greetings, young one. I am Manik
Compolten, High Watchman. Are you a [new warrior] or an [experienced fighter]?

    <so far so good, I could speak a "hail" to him without having
    him targeted, and he responds as expected.  Now I'll clear
    my target and try to speak the quest phrase to him:>

[Tue Jun 12 01:06:02 2001] Manik Compolten says 'It is always good to see new
blood amongst the Gemchoppers. I have a small task for you. Take this keycard. I
will give you only one at a time. Use each to obtain blackboxes for the C series

bring them all to me. Let me know if you need another keycard.

    <Bingo>

I tried various combinations, and he would NEVER respond
to the quest trigger phrase unless I had him targeted at the
time I uttered the trigger phrase.

Bizbee, you imply that you're able to have quest conversations
with NPCs after clearing your target -- what's the story?
