Wizards solo great up to at least 52.

As for being appreciated in groups, the highest level person I know
says he loved having Wizards in his groups.  Perhaps you know more
than he does, though, since he might have missed some aspects of the
game while he was busy killing the Avatar of War, and working out
strategy for waking the Sleeper, and stuff like that, when he was one
of the main Clerics for Legacy of Steel.  I'm willing to listen if you
can post some reason for me to believe you are more qualified to
discuss the usefullness of various classes in EQ.

As someone who has played both games, and finds DAoC much better than
EQ (EQ has more content *now*, but DAoC has a better system, and I
think Mythic can fix content easier and faster than Verant can fix
their system), I bet you will come to dislike your DAoC Wizard, if you
play one.  The DAoC Wizard is a subtle class.
