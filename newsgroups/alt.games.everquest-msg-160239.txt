Yesterday while in a group at OT the druid and I ported to nexus and both
got KEI. The druid is a dwarf lvl 34 with wis bace of 114. I am a human
cleric lvl 36 wis 140. When we returned to our group the druid and I
comparied our wis. The druids wis was at 235 and mine wis was at 165. I
don't understand. We were in the same KEI group and got the same KEI hit. So
I am at a compleat loss for understanding why this happened. I would really
like to figure this one out. All my equipment is wis and mana based with
nothing taking wis away. Anyone have a clue?
