Thanks to yourself and to graeme, the upgrade worked and eq looks stable.
The pin problem was complicated by a front end connector occupying 4 slots
and using 2; thus blocking a power switch! I can live without a hard drive
light... it was just confusing because the manual never mentioned anythin
beyond "attach connectors appropriately" and the case has no label i can use
to search for a reference, and the illustrations on the net always showed
cables with the polarity labelled. No triangles! No oblongs! No
hyperspheroids in ultraviolent and infradead colours. Just "+" and "-".
Sigh. I hate computers!
