Total buffmaster with increases to about every stat and of course SOW. Only
class able to make potions via alchemy.

One of the two classes able to port, the only one able to port to the
planes. Gets a solo god at higher levels being the only only truly able to
quad kite. (Also gets a wimpy pet at lvl 55 or so IIRC). Is very much
unwanted at lower levels, but is a necessety in groups at higher ones.

Nothing more to say :)

The other class able to port around. Also gets tracking (not as well as a
ranger, but still) and IIRC forage as a class ability. Has some buff spells,
but nothing like the cleric's or shaman's.
Gets upgraded versions of SoW to travel around very fast.
Ideal race: Half-elf or wood-elf. Most I've seen are wood-elves because of
the theme.

Has some good anti-undead spells as well. Essential to any groups above lvl
30 because of complete heal and ressurections.

Soloing is really crappy, although it can be done. Master of crowd control
with mezmerize and charms. The mana buffs and resistance buffs/debuffs make
him essential to higher level groups, who appreciate his crowd control as
well :) Pet is too wimpy to be of much use, and is known to pull trains and
break mezzes because of no control.
Only class to efficiently make sellable Jewelry because of the enchant metal
spells.

Group: 5 out of 5

Only caster to have no root spell. Is totally dependant on his pet for
defense, but has offensive magic only surpassed by wizards. Has a nice
debuff and the best damageshields in the game. Can pick from 4 different
pets to suit the situation. The mage epic summons the best pet in the game.
Call of the Hero used to be a much sought after spell at higher levels, but
the remove-aggro effect was removed so it's a lot less useful. Very similar
to a necro, but functions less solo, but better in groups.

One of the best taunters in the game. Has the best means to fight undead,
both with spells as with weapons. Can function as off-time healer.

Good damage output, but very weak defense. Best class for pulling mobs
outside because of tracking and proficiency with bows. Can cast SoW starting
lvl 30.

Probably the best taunter in the game, with the Paladin as a close second.
The lifeleech spells, pet and feign death make it also a competent soloer.

> Bard

> Group: 5 out of 5

Second best crowd controller in the game, only second to an enchanter. The
fast switching of songs and twisting make the bard the most versatile
player. Much wanted if no enchanter around.
His speed song is the fastest means of travel after ports.

> Ideal Race: Ogre

Often refered to as "Meatshield".


> Rogue

> Ideal race: Halfling

> Group: 3/5

Has the ability to sneak and hide with which he can go anywhere. Mediocre
damage dealer until he gets in a group and attack from the back. Stresses
the taunting ability of any tank.

> Monk

> Ideal Race: Iksar
> Solo: 4/5
> Group: 3/5

Best puller for indoors because of feign death skill. Can't carry much
because heavy weight reduces his armor class exponentially. Only second to
rogues in damage dealing, with the note that monks don't need to be at the
back of a mob and can use a variety of weapons.

Maybe if someone collects all the posts here we might put up a better
description then the ones on castersrealm and such :)
