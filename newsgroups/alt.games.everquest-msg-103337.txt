I don't treat alcohol as not being dangerous.  But I do not consider it a
hard drug.  As for morphine, it is given under strict conditions, something
that isn't very easy to get a hold of where as alcohol is.  Also, in the
basis of addiction, depending on the intake, as some have mentioned, you
don't get hooked hard on the physical addiction that alcohol gives to a
person.  Hence the feeling and notion of it not being a hard drug.  Yes, a
person can get alcohol poisoning, yes, alcohol is a drug, a depressant at
that.  And while alcohol impairs judgement by drinking too much, it is
going into it, you use common sense and self control to prevent yourself
from going too far, too fast to allow it.  At the same time, you can get
people who get shitface drunk, but not become an alcoholic or need a daily
fix of alcohol to feel like they exist.  This is the point I am making
versus smoking or actual drug use.  There are people out there, who can
drink responsibly, who aren't alcoholics, and can use common sense and self
control, does it mean all drinkers are automatic alcoholics?  No.
