My guild is holding the even described above, and due to too many people
having no slots free on EMarr, we are considering disrupting someone elses'
server.  If one of you kind people out there has a bind capable person and
would be willing to volunteer your server, and some time to bind a bunch of
level 1 gnomes outside CB, please contact me either in game, or by email.
You would be welcome to participate as well, and would be welcome to keep
any of the uber loot we get in CB, as none of us will have much use for it
on your server.
