Oh, and, by the way, there is no rule specificly against copyrighted
or trademarked names. There is against pop culture referrences and
referrences that fall out of the time period/fantasy setting. Also
against names taken from popular literature, movies, etc. The "brand
name" Lokari falls under none of these classifications.
