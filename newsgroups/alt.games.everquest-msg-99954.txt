Depends on what's on the bottom.  *laugh*

And that's fair for both parties, I think.  They're rid of someone they
didn't enjoy playing with, and you're rid of a group you didn't like.

I've played both casters and melees up past the 20s, and this is how I
handle it.

From the puller's point of view, bad pulls are sometimes hard to avoid.
Derv camps in NRO at 10-13th can be really hard to break properly.  Pulling
anything from a populated/semi-populated area is tricky.  At least half of
it is luck.  When I've made a bad pull, I don't expect my group to back me.
I tell them to run like hell.  8)

From a caster's perspective, I handle it two ways.  First, I guess it helps
to mention that my caster is a 'Chantress, and is thus on crowd control
detail, Tashing detail, sometimes dotting and slowing and hasting detail,
and so forth.  For me, gating is a matter of degree.

One add?  Hm.  Mezz resists?  Eek.  Both tanks down?  GATE, GATE, GATE!  One
particular instance I remember was in the Sarnak Fort in LOIO.  We'd had a
fight with three really scary adds, all of us were LoM/health/whatever when
some jackass pulls something very red and very nasty.  All the casters gated
the minute it entered the room.  We knew we'd lose, and so we evac-ed as
best we could.

In many ways, this dynamic changes the more you level.  At 10 or so, you're
kind of expected to stand and die (esp. if your the cleric or warrior)
trying to salvage the pull.  Age a bit, and you'll find that most folks are
more willing to accept your judgement under reasonable circumstances.
