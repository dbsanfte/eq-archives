Well, can't get shawl #8 for 100pp, I'll happily admit. I guess it's nice
that there's at least 1 of the 8 prayer shawls worth wearing...  And qeynos
badge #4 has a cool effect. But badge #3 is gathering dust in my bank bags.
And is anyone actually wearing coldain rings 1-7? Or are those yet more
"oooo, thank god that's over with, *bank*"?

... wait, I reread what you wrote and now I'm confused. So are you saying
that the prayer shawls and aid grimel quest *are* worth doing or *aren't*
worth doing by the time you can actually do them?
