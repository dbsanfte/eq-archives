I was there in EC when that guy/girl was there complaining about the person
that was after him. It would be one thing if the name was some swear or
other vulgarity, or if some gm themselves catch it. Other than that I
personally just do not understand the motive to do that? Did that name
really interfere with your playing in some way? I know there is people who
like to roleplay, but 99.9% of people who I've ever met in the game do not
_in any form whatsoever_ roleplay, just seems to me like petitioning peoples
names for that reason is like trying to mow your lawn with a pair of
scissors (and forgive me if it is not your reason, I just can't imagine any
other unless as mentioned above its flat out nasty).
Anyway this is obviously a touchy subject, Im not trying to get any fight
going, if it's against the rules then I suppose it will always be your right
to petition names like that, but since you asked I figured I'd give my
personal opinion that I will never like it when people do that.
