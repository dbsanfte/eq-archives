Once again your wonderful reading comprehesion is showing.  I was relating a
story which I was reminded of after reading Remington Stone's reference to
having taught a 4 yr old about monocots and dicots.  You asked a question of
me, and I gave you the answer, becuase I respect your right to ask
questions.

Simply becasue my childern were older than 2 at this point in time does not
give any credence to your belief that young children, even those as young as
2, not only express curiousity in the form of questions, or that they do not
deserve the respect to have their questions answered.
