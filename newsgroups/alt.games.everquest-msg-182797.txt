    I was fighting in cobalt scar last night with my BAH. Quite a number of
my double hits read like 141 170....

    How the hell can a dot that takes a minute to do as much dmg as half of
them be considered vaguely relevant. Hell I wouldn't be casting dooming
darkness if all it did was the 300dmg. Not one single mob lasted long enough
to eat a whole cast of that, not even when our ranger pulled 4 death-parrots
at once.

    Heh, couldn't care less about grief-play most of it's reportable.... It
would just REALLY annoy me to be killed by dickheads all the time...

    On the other hand there's been a number of cases where someone's KS'd
off me that I would LOVE to just cast one snare on them and watch the mob
pound them into the earth... I notice snares cancel your sow..... ouch

    I'm fully aware of that, but I coun't 170dmg over a minute to be so
vanishingly small it may as well not exist too. Seriously, at this level
mobs have what, 2-4k hp? Please to be break-giving?

    Yeah, I've started buying that stuff up. Actually, the best thing is
buying the bits and making it myself. My alt's smithing is 152, need it up
over 200..... long haul but worth it. Want that DE cultural armour :)

    Don't see how druids would, but shaman and necros do seem to like their
pet holding agro. Actually necros tend to fear kite so i doubt it counts too
much for them, and shaman probably kite anyway, their pet hits hard but can
it tank? I don't know I dont play a shaman and when I play WITH one their
pet sure as hell isnt tanking hehe.

    Besides, clinging darkness having more agro than the 400 point agro
spell you get 20 levels later? Sorry, but thats just ridiculous.

    Well, when I started using it and whenever I fear kite in fact, I don't
do it without c3, and I can't see how it would be viable without c3.
Possible yes, viable no. And c3 at level 15 is just as good as c3 at level
50... wish I'd known...... ;)

    Well, I'll try it out but I bet it has only a minor effect on the
outcome of a battle :)
