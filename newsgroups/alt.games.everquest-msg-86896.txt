Don't know any multi-player games like EQ, but Daggerfall and the Might and
Magic Series have the same "feel" to it; free movement, non linear gameplay,
lots of sidequests, but you can also totally ignore quests and just hunt
monsters :)

Daggerfall is really old by now and the M&M series has serious outdated
graphics as well. If you want to buy one I advice M&M 6 (VI). 7 and higher
actually has smaller worlds and less "playtime".
