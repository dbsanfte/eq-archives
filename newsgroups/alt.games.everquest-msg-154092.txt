I don't have EverQuest, but this may be your problem:

I and others have found that on certain machines NIS 2003 prevents
Direct3D games from running fullscreen (minimizing them at startup). 
Since EverQuest can't be minimized, my guess is it just crashes.  You
can test if you have the bug by running the DxDiag 3D test.  If it
says the test was interrupted by keypress than you are experiencing
the bug.

The program is with ccApp.exe which is part of Norton AntiVirus 2003. 
You have 2 choices.  Either kill ccApp.exe before running EverQuest
(but this disables NAV) or try the following:

Before running EverQuest switch your desktop resolution to whatever
resolution the game runs at.  I've found that this lets me run games
on my system.

The only permanent solution is to uninstall NAV 2003 or wait for
Symantec to patch it, but so far they say they've been unable to
reproduce the problem.
