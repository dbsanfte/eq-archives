"Go on the Test server and see for yourself."

"Go to www.everquest.com and read the Developer's Boards."

"Go to http://eq.castersrealm.com and read the head lines."

It look me less than a few seconds to type each line.

"You stupid, son-of-a-bitch! Why the hell can't you go and research this
sort of thing on your own instead of pestering me, or asking for information
on a newsgroup? I mean, god damn, it's not like you learn things by asking!"

Surprisingly enough, it took me more time to write a paragraph to bitch at
him, than it did to write one sentence to point him in the general
direction. And to think, I'm not even counting the time it takes for you to
argue with me over something like this...
