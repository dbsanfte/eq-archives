You started playing after the bazaar was already up and running, huh?
I remember EC when *it* was the *bazaar zone*.  My level 22 druid responded to
a "/auc WTB hand made backpacks".  I /tell the guy I have 2 for sale, 70 plat
each.  He responds that he'll take both, he needs 10 slot bags for bank
storage.  My dreams of riches fades.
I /tell him he can buy cheap 10 slot boxes in Iceclad for a few plat each, much
cheaper for storing stuff.  His response, "what?".  So I send him another tell,
explaining that I would be happy to sell him both, and would even give him a
discount, but I hated to take advantage of a new player.  He tells me to meet
him at the tunnel. 
Next thing I know, this fancy clad guy is casting a multitude of buffs on me -
buffs I've never even *seen* before.  Its the BUYER!  He says he still wants
the 2 bags.  I put them in the trade window and he puts in a stack of jewels. 
I ask what they are.  He tells me they are peridots and quite valuable.  I am
totally clueless of what a peridot is, but decide to trust the guy.  I hit
trade, all the while knowing I'm going to kick myself in the ass over this
deal.  Then this *BEAR* comes running up.  I move to attack him and realize
that the BEAR is casting buffs on me too!  
I know for a fact I gained 3 levels before those buffs faded.  
I miss those days...
