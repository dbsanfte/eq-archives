Never tried but there is a JavaScript command (something like window.close)
that allows you to close a window. Usually its done with popup windows, you
click a button when you're finished reading their contents to close them.
I've not tried but maybe you could combine this command with the onLoad
command to close the browser (because it would close the current window).
Good way to keep people with JavaScript out of your site. Not sure why any
inteligent person would do this, but it might work.
