There are many places where broadband simply isn't an option.  And not
always just in the rurals and hinterlands.

For instance, I had a (sic) real job as a director at American Express
living in the Phoenix, AZ metro area.  At that time (3 or 4 years ago)
cable and DSL still were not options and ISDN was damned expensive.
They got cable to my neighborhood just as I left (/cry) and,last I
heard, DSL still wasn't an option due to the way the phone lines had
been implemented in the neighborhoods (some techno-babble about
optical mini-relays or some such).
