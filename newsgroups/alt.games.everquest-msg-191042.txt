The only thing training points are useful for is to "initialize" skills that
you get after level one, and you only need one for each skill. You can get
skill points by practicing your skills in the field.

The only other time you would really want to use practice points is to
quickly bring up a skill you have missed or neglected, for example if as a
paly you have concentrated on 1hs and 2hs and suddenly find a sweet 1hb you
want to use, but cannot cause enough damage with to effectively fight things
that would give you skill points from the melee.
