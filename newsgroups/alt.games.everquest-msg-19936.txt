I'm fuzzy on what /report actually does.  If I'm right it sends a transcript
of the visible ten lines of text on your screen to a Guide or some other
Verant CS apparatus.  Basically it creates a record (that, unlike your log
file, can't be altered) of the last few things you've seen/done.  It is
particularly useful in cases where player Fuckhead_01 won't leave you alone.
He curses you, you tell him to go away, he keeps doing it, and you hit
/report.  His stream of invective is now stored for reference.  If you then
/petition, the Guide could look at the report and verify that what you say
is true, and what Fuckhead_01 comes up with to defend himself with is a lie.
Otherwise it would be your word against his.

If I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will be around tout de suite to say so.
