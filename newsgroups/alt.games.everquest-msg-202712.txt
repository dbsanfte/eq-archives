It's always been an interesting question. Wizard DPS is so hard
to parse and dependant on so many other factors such as agro,
resists and mana. Also the pull rate has a large part to play.
I suspect that a monk still probably beats the DPS of a equivalent
wizard in a fast pull XP grou. On a raid, especially in PoP, the
wizards rule.

Flying kick does more than chaotic stab I believe. However since
neither of these should be tanking in PoP, nor even standing at
the front (riposte is insane in PoP) it's fairly irrelevant. In
real terms flying kick is always competing against backstab, and
there's just no comparison.

I've been very impressed watching a skilled bard pull. Extremely
impressive in the hands of someone who can juggle the mass of
abilities they have. Add in a guaranteed mem-wipe if they need
to abort the pull and it's pretty safe.

Though to be honest for an xp grind group any complex pulling
just slows things down too much. I'd rather just pull a couple
and have some CC and lots of DPS.
