Ogre.

Make agil at least 75, with a bit of a cushion.

Max stamina.

Put any left into int though its no big deal really. A hybrid's
main thing is not their mana pool.

Don't buy int gear for mana. "good" sk gear you can buy in the bazaar
pretty cheap will have AC/HP and mana on it usually, perhaps even int.
A lot of cheap accessory items are pretty much made for paladins and
sks. If you more or less go for the largest AC and HP item you can
reasonbly afford, per slot, It will usually have mana or int also.
