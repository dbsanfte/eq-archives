My Iksar had no problem getting out of the water at any of the
openings down in that maze, but when I tried to do it with an
enchanter, I was unable to find an enchanter race which could do
the trick, not even an erudite (tallest of the chanters).  I
think it probably has to do with the incredibly high swim skill
of a starting iksar, probably I could get out of the water on
other race's characters if they had their swim skill high
enough.  

But since the point was to bring in an alt and get exp off the
level 1 to 3 mobs, and to level up a chanter I wanted to try,
that wasn't working out.  It -might- be possible to make the run
you describe, down thru the SK guild, but I'll wager some of the
SK guildmasters see invis and that won't be pretty at all!

I've been there many times as well, its a bit of a trick to jump
across to there but not really all that hard.  With the new LOY
maps avaialable for everyone there's no excuse for not being able
to find them.

For more fun, try getting your note to the guy in the shaman
guild in cabalis, back before you appeared in front of him.  You
have to climb up a ladder and then jump across from there...
usually falling flat on the floor below.  Whats up with that!
