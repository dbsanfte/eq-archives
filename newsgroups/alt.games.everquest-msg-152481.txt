I have a strange Bazaar story also. I, a Wood Elf, Ranger, was shopping in
the Bazaar when I looked up at my health bar. To my supprise there was a pet
health bar beneath it. I clicked my pet button (which I never use lol) and I
had someone's warder as my pet. I couldn't get it to obey any commands
though; it just stood there looking at me. I tried to send a tell to the
owner but she was off-line. Pet forgot to log and hooked up with me. Strange
bug.
