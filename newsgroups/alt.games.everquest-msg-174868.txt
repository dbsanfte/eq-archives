Well, what with Paludal, it normally doesn't take me long to solo a
character to 23.  :b

My poor wizard is lagging terribly on test though, mostly lack of play, but,
I have to admit, I am finding it more difficult to solo him, completely
untwinked, than I did all my twinks on EMarr.

To get back on the subject though, I was just saying that you should not
rule out a spell or an ability being one of the best in the game strictly
based on what level it is obtained at.
