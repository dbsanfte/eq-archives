I think most news servers will carry a group if they get requests for it 
(especially if it has no binaries); the point I was making was that 
people would naturally come here because they don't see see the EQ2 
group, and we'd then "intervene" by suggesting they ask their news 
providers to carry the EQ2 group.

If I'm wrong about how easy it is to get servers to carry a group, then 
that won't work.
