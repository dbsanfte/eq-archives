   He is wrong and wants to argue a position that is wrong, no doubt about it. 
But just holding and defending a wrong position doesn't automatically make him a
troll, I think.  

   Now, if he had gone into rec.pets.cats.anecdotes and posted this position,
then yes, I would vote for the "he's a troll" title.  Actually, it's kinda
interesting to see him twist things around 180 degrees to support his position. 
I'm not arguing the point with him anymore per se either.  It's kinda like
arguing with someone who insists that the apollo missions were all faked.  All I
am doing at this point is pointing out when he twists Lenny or mine words.
