Offhand I would suspect that it is related to the power saving
features of the laptop. Is your Harddrive going into sleep or power
saving mode while you are playing? When you attempt to zone the server
may think you are LD due to the fact that the HDD doesn't have
sufficient time to spin back up. When you first enter a zone most if
not all of the data you need is loaded at that time into memory. If
you spend 15-20 minutes in a zone it is possible that your HDD may
spin down due to inactivity.

Cheers
