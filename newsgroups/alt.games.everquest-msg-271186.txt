We're talking about the general question, "Is it good to allow people to cast
buffs on others not in their group?"   Or at least that's how the discussion
started.

Someone a few days ago posted a complaint about EQ2 because they were not
allowed to buff people not in their group.  I said that this was a good thing,
because buff whores had hurt EQ1.   Then a few days after that this person
came along and provided too good of an example (of one of the arguments
against it) to pass up, so I pointed it out.  Which is what began this little
thread.

Even with EQ1's current limitations on out of group buffs... (recipient level
limits), there can still be no doubt that because of it, this poster is going
to arrive in his 20's or 30's with no clue how to play his class.   Before
there were those limitations in place, it was common for people to arrive at
the maximum level with no clue how to play their character.

And that's not even touching on the other problems that out of group
uberbuffing causes, including effects on group desirability of various
classes, and destroying all challenge and fun in the lower level game.     If
you want to see the arguments in full, search Google for posts to this
newsgroup about KEI and "nerf".

Buff whores selling buffs hurt EQ1 badly.    Even with the current limitations
on them, they are still having a negative effect.   EQ2 does not allow out of
group buffing, and in my opinion EQ2's stance is better.   The player
interaction from giving and selling buffs to non group members is in no way
worth the damage it does to the game.
