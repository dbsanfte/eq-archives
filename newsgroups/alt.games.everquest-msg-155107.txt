I group with just about anyone that is of appropriate level, and that I
know.  I almost never do pickup groups.  If I pay for KEI, it's because some
enchanter has set up in Nexus, and is casting it for plat.  I then go off
and solo.  This makes my soloing more efficient, but, I still go off and
solo even when I can't find someone casting KEI.  It might affect other
people in the way you mention, but, it has nothing to do with my decision of
who to group with, or not to group with.
