Remind me of something I read on rinkworks:

Tech Support: "Oh, that's the problem you need the latest version." 
Customer: "Ok, how do I get it?" 
Tech Support: "Well, just transfer the file via FTP." 
Customer: "Well that would be nice, but I can't connect to the
Internet." 
Tech Support: (sounding exasperated) "I told you just to FTP the file
sir." 
I hung up.
