This just irks me to all get out.  Trueshot lasts for 2 min? So you
are saying in that 2 min you continue to get the bonus from the Disc?
Monks Thunder kick lasts for 6 min... BUT, it only works for the Next
kick that lands... and most of the time the damage is less than Id get
out of a normal flying kick...  How the hell is that a balance.  I
could understand if they limited the T-Kick time to like 2 or 1 min
but allowed you to continue to get a critical kick durring that time.
Monks disciplines are rather Pithy... except Stone stance.  rest (well
up to 55 just now so havent used any others) are just lame.
