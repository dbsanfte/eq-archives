Yes I had considered all of those . Yes I think some can all be applied. Yes
its a huge mess . I think they are avoiding the issue because a court case
that recognized a property interest would be diastrous for Sony . I also
believe that that property interest already exsists it has just not been
enforced yet by the courts.

Bankruptcy laws protect from a failing game just subchapter the game itself.

Most of the game balance issues should be protected though really obvious
stupid ones wouldnt be ( only enforceable in the case of negligence).
Banning is a real problem though . It represents direct financial harm and
if it is done for something found unenforceable (the eula) they could be
found financially responsible for all harm done.
