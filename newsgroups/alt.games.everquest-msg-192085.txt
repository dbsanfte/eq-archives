I was of the understanding that those masks are infact player made.
So the only reason the trader had them was someone sold them to him, they
are not part of his "normal" stock.

This means theat when the trader resets he dumps off all the items he would
not normally sell.

for example ...

Trader Boris was born into the world to sell
Rat ears
Batwings
Firebeetle eyes
Flasks of water.

Ranger Bob wants to work on his tailoring, he makes 34 acrylia masks (a
popular skill up item) he sets up all night in trader mode in the bazaar
only to sell 2, gets bored and goes and sells the remaining 32 masks to
Trader Boris.

Now anyone who inspects Trader Boris will see him selling
Rat ears
Batwings
Firebeetle eyes
Flasks of water
Acrylia masks

Sony in the meantime feel guilty for messing with the faction issues from
illusions and decide to patch.
All NPC's are reset

Now anyone who inspects Trader Boris will find hes back to only selling
Rat ears
Batwings
Firebeetle eyes
Flasks of water.

And everyone is happy ... kind of.
