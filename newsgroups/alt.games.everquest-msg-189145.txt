Just an FYI on this part....   go to:
http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/

but do this before logging on... download the zip file which has all
the available zones.

Extract to map directory...   Then log on to EQ... otherwise they will
not be there untill you connect to EQ again.

thats why they wouldnt show for you.

Good hunting
