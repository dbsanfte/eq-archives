Just checked out the prices for pre-ordering EQ2 on the SOE store site and
one other place that I know ships to the UK and has a price for EQ2.

SOE's store was a few dollars cheaper, about $4, but of course you do get
the starter kit. I decided to go through the ordering stage to see how much
it would cost including shipping from SOE as the other site is free shipping
worldwide. I couldn't believe what I saw ... $33 for shipping ... and it
would take 4-6 weeks!!

So basically I'm paying around an extra 30 bucks for the starter kit and to
wait at least a month after the release before I can play. The free shipping
place orders usually arrive within a week btw. I'll be buying from dvd box
office for ï¿½27.47 and do without the starter kit I think ... unless there's
somewhere I don't know of that has a better deal to the UK?
