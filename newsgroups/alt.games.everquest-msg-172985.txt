    Ethereal Silk Swatches, for the PoP armour quests. Two strands of ether
and an ethereal curing agent, combined in the PoK loom. You can't attempt
the combine unless you have a modified Tailoring skill of 220 or higher, and
they go trivial at 212. Since I have those shears from Shei (+15%
Tailoring), I had a modified skill of 220 when my actual skill was 192. So I
could skill off them big-time. Strands cost roughly 2.5 plat each off a
vendor, and most vendors in PoK and PoTranq have a stack or so. The curing
agents are a pack of Paeala Sap, a Soda, and two Celestial Essences and are
also skill-restricted to 220. So I had the guild officer who was paying for
me to do this log on a monk that has 250 Brewing and he made them for me as
I worked.

    158 to 176 on Soft Fur Padding? I guess since you can solo the stuff
it's OK, otherwise I'd call you nuts. I did most of my work up to 192 making
acrylia tailored goods. At least on my server, there's still acrylia studded
(cloak, tunic, sleeves) and reinforced (boots, tunic, mantle, leggings)
items that sell well enough to recoup costs even over the crazy amounts
charged in The Bazaar. Studded goes trivial at 188, though, so you have to
watch that. I picked up cobalt drake hides when I saw them for cheap because
cobalt drake hide armour is pretty cheap to attempt for velious tailoring,
and the belts (a two boning piece) still sell for 1 K each if I got lucky.
I'd have done some othmir attempts, but I never see the furs for sale
anymore. Stay away from arctic wyvern, it eats cash compared with solstice
robes (speaking as someone that can imbue his own emeralds, YMMV). When you
hit 210, you can do what I did to get to 212 - those swatches are the
cheapest combine I've ever seen in post-158 tailoring.
