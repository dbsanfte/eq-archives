I group for xp, solo to do certain quests (other quests fly by in a group),
and to tradeskill. Solo xp at my level (16 brawler) is not great, but i do
know heroic opportunities seem to solve the power issue. Of course, it would
also help to be able to see exactly the effect of different food drink to
regen rates.

I tend to like wandering about harvesting and bashing ... e.g. i have to
kill orc scouts, there's a line of nodes, i'll wander down the line
harvesting and slaying. The harvested items i've been trading straight away
for items or skills i need, using the crafters channel, although due to the
aforementioned lack of food/drink stats, no-one seems to be specialising in
it, so those items tend to get chucked.

If you want to make money and nothing else, you can make a lot solo, by
crafting and doing tasks for your wholesaler, but i am lazy. Collectables
and so forth do sell well.

Another thing about soloing in eq1 was that there used to be a lot of high
level mobs in low level zones... fighting orcs in the oasis, and being
trained by spectres! Now, if you are trained, who cares, leave the mobs
alone and they wander away. They have relatively short aggro radius so far.

I don't find the people on antonia bayle to be hard to group with at all, at
least in the commonlands. There is always someone starting up a group, and
if you don't have a perfect mix, it doesn't really matter. So long as you
have someone in the healing group of classes, someone to tank (as a brawler
i do ok, but i miss the eq1 feign death, eq2 watered it down), it's nothing
like eq1 where i might get turned down from a group.

The fact that a lot of people have as a quest "kill 30 orc pawns" means they
want as many people as possible, because whatever the individual xp is from
the pawn, it's the quest xp that is not divided. Besides, people get
obsessed with finishing quests and clearing out the journal. I do, anyhow.
The way you can rez a priest class if they cast this spell before hand is
funky, so if things wipe, i can fd, then rez the priest. This makes groups
very flexible and desirable.

If you don't like the people you are grouping with, try getting to know ppl
on the chat channels first, then grouping with them.

Good luck anyway, and use feedback politely with positive suggestions, and
they will listen and not dismiss you as a ratbag.
