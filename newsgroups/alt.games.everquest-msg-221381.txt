Hmmm...here are three possible abilities that could be useful to give EQ
Warriors, along those lines.  Since I'm ripping these off from DAoC, I'll
the same names they have there:

1. "Guard".  When you guard someone, you have a chance of blocking melee
attacks directed against them.  This could even be tied to one of the stats
that is kind of worthless now in EQ, like DEX, to make that stat useful. :-)

2. "Protect".  When you protect someone, aggro from offensive spells,
or from healing or buffing, or from mezzing, is split, with part of it going
to the protector.

3. "Intercept".  Put this on someone, and you take one melee hit for them.
One shot thing, reusable something like every 15 seconds.  Probably not that
useful for EQ (although maybe if it could also deflect a HT or DT, it could
be useful for the Warrior to use on the Monk who is pulling).  (Very useful
in DAoC in the frontier, where a Warrior-type can use it to to protect a
caster from an opening arrow that might otherwise nearly take them out).
