REF :PATCH MESSAGE, JANUARY 15, 2003
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Item Links are once again creatable from Items and from other Item
Links. Please do not attempt to "mine" the servers for undiscovered
items. Links now have a built-in mechanism to prevent those who would
go on fishing expeditions by sending up many bad links in an attempt
to discover new items. These invalid links are logged, as are the
accounts of those who create them. "
