   Maybe it isn't my imagination that you've been even more
querulous and petty than usual.  Nothing like stressing about
money to bring out the worse in someone.

   It is bad in California, no doubts about that.  Lenny, who is
good at fixing computers, had to find a job as a security guard
instead.  And it wasn't enough for us to make it here.  Good
riddance to California.  The weather is nice, but the rest of the
state is out of whack.  

   Speaking of security guard, have you considered that, DT?  The
work sucks (though Lenny likes it) and it only pays a smidgen
over minimum... but it _does_ pay.  And since if you do go this
route, you'll probably be working at night, it will leave the
days open for you to follow any leads for better jobs should any
present themselves.
