Which is why I'd not do it. So we agree!

So I'd never make a cartoon which seemed to do that within that
context.

Yep. I understand the artists intent, in fact I like his comics. But I
think he went about it in a bad way. Obviously he doesn't meant to
say, 

"Warrior with indo bp and some cobalt, played by large man eating
chips in parents basement, is akin to firefighter risking life for
others!" 

but the viewer can get a comparison like that from it. It ends up
seeming like a sarcastic joke in a way. I guess it kind of depends on
the first feeling you get from it. Those were my first feelings.

In a caption contest for that cartoon, instead of what it says above
them, I'd pick things like:

"Real life hero:
There simply is no comparison!"

"Lives in video game for 12 hours a day,
Risks life to save others in shifts that last 12 hours a day." 

I guess that I'm not very subtle ;)
