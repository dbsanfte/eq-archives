I'd like to point out that WS means ranger are sometimes BETTER tanks 
than SK or paladins, who have no way to prevent all incoming damage. 
When you engage a mob that does outlandishly high damage, particularly 
preslowed, having a class use some disc that gets them out of damage 
entirely will give you time to position, or slow, or even to Burn It 
Down (some mobs have small HP and high DPS).

As an SK, I can only look on in chagrin as Warriors, Rangers, Monks, 
even Rogues tank mobs that would lay me out in seconds.

Admittedly the 20 second duration on ranger WS, coupled with their 
relatively poor mitigation and AC/HP totals mean that once the duration 
is over they drop like an SK successfully FDing, but that 20 seconds is 
often long enough to get the job done, and its often 17 seconds longer 
than I would have lasted.
