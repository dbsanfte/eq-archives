So these were old games that just didn't sell ... or even get marketed?  I
did think they were like Gems.  Something they created on the side and then
threw in.  I couldn't understand why they didn't just assign these
programmers to make more content to fill up the extra space.  Would have
loved some unpublicized islands off the main islands that players would
eventually stumble over and then spread the information about through the EQ
grapevine.  Or another dungeon on Velious with an unpublicized secret
entrance that players would have again eventually discover.
