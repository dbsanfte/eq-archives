At your level, the root and nuke technique is pretty much all you can do.
Use you biggest DD nuke to get the mob to almost no health, then finish it
off with a smaller nuke. Pretty simple.
You might want to put up your Lesser Shielding spell, for extra protection
also. Shadow step is also good for a quick escape. Things will get a lot
better for you at level 12. You will get better nukes, and Bind Affinity.
Bind Affinity will make traveling (and dying) a lot easier on you.

As far as training goes-
Evocation is your most important thing right now. Put some points into it.
Later on, research will be very important to you, so you might want to think
about putting a few points into that also. Don't worry about training
Conjuration. You can get that skill up by casting Halo of Light, and Eye Of
Zomm over and over again.

Tradeskills are not that important to a Wizard, but they are fun. They can
be good, if you are tired of the grind, or if you don't have much pp to buy
food/water with. Some people do like to make cloth armor for their Wizard. I
just bought a newbie robe, until I could afford a better one.

Your casting gets interrupted because your Channeling skill is low. As that
skill gets higher with each cast, your casts will get interrupted less
often.
