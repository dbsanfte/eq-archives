First off a couple of facts....

You can hit magical with your special attacks (round kick, tiger claw,
etc). At level 30 your hands become "magical" and you won't need an
item to hit magical creatures. Look for a pair of Split Paw Hide
gloves for 10-15pp. They are a little heavy, but they will allow you
to hit magical creatures like wisps. You could also kill the frogloks
(levels 4-6 I believe)  in the Qeynos Catacombs. They drop netted
armor (including gloves) which will hit magical as well. You will need
a map, so look at www.eqatlas.com There is an exp bonus applied to
that zone so look for a partner (or two) and hunt the smugglers till
14-15. At 11 you should be able to kill the thugs, but I don't think
you will get much exp.

What you "need" the most is levels. As a monk you are not as dependant
on equipment as other melee classes.  Armor wise look to upgrade to
cured silk and then progress to Wu's or other light weight pieces as
you come across them.
