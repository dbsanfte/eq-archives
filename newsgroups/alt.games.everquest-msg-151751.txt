I've been 54 since Sept. 3. Granted, I've got my XP divided into 50% AA.
I've made 2 AA points as of last night just this level, and still only have
77% of this level finished. I *might* ding 55 by the end of the week. And I
tend to play straight XP grind average of three hours a night. I'd say more
on the weekends, but usually I get some grinding in on top whatever raids
I'm attending (which usually tends to be negative XP).

I'd say yer being optimistic about 1 week a level in the 50s.

It gets slow. It gets REALLY slow. You really have to love that class, and
want to keep playing just it. This is also why you get something new each
level post 50- I think murders would be commited if we really had to wait
another 5 levels for spell upgrades at that point! And the mob levels make a
huge difference with each level increase. Did I mention it gets slow? Think
mollasses. In January.

Go ahead and learn to quad that wizzie, and have some fun with him. Ignore
the XP bar and the ding gratification- play for the joy of playing. Play
alts if that is what makes you happy and come back to him. Just whatever you
do, DON'T DELETE him. You never know if/when you'll come back.
