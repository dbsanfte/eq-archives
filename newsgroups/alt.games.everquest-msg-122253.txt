Still doesn't answer the question, though... What makes "shit" any
more rude than "crap"? I've seen explainations from plenty of people
on why I shouldn't use the words, which all boil down to "because
they're rude", but I have yet to see anyone explain why they are
considered so bad.

The only conclusion I can draw is no one really knows. I don't see any
reason why they should be treated differently from any other word. You
say using them without intent to be rude is kind of stupid, I say this
fixation on them being so bad is extremely stupid.
