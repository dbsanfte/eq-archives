That statement is not always true.  Depending on what's available for
your caster to kill, doubling your mana pool could make an enormous
difference.  Consider, if you have 80% of the mana necessary to break
a spawn it is worthless to you, if you have 160% of the necesary mana
you've identified a viable hunting area.  The easy stuff is often
contested, so having more choices can make quite a difference to how
fast you gain xp.

All of you are forgetting that under 20 (and especially under 10) a
caster can melee very effectively in twink gear, giving him a clear
edge over the lowbie melee because he also has his spells.  I was
astonished at how easy it was to level an Enchanter to 17 when I
played one for a while about a year ago, better gear is cheaper now...
