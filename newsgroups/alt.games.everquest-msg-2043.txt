I'm afraid so. You need to be able to put no-drop items into ovens,
forges, etc., so they can be used in recipes. However, you have to
combine and use them, or remove them, before clicking done. Otherwise,
someone else could open it and remove the no-drop item. This would be
an easy way to transfer no-drop items between players, defeating the
whole purpose of having no-drop items.
