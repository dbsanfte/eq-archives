You will find your 1hb and 2hb are mildly useful later on.  I find it
likely that you could level to 65 (or 70 in a few months) and get
hundreds of AAs and never once, ever, find a need to use H2H...or at
least need it to be above around skill 15 or 20.

Occaisionally you will be attacked by a level 6 orc while naked and
would like to kill it.  Even then, a relatively low H2H skill will
take care of the problem.  Outside of this rare occurance, there is
pretty much no reason to even work on H2H.
