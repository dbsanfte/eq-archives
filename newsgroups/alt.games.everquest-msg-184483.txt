Several years ago my father lost his job when the arms budget was reduced
during the Reagan administration.  He spent almost two years without a job
except for part-time work as a school bus driver.  The rest of his time he
spent listening to Rush Limbaugh and talking on his HAM radio.

The point is, it wasn't Rush Limbaugh or HAM radio that was addictive, it
was his depression and insecurity about his future that kept him from
getting a job.

Although I really hate to compare EQ to Rush Limbaugh, I think you all get
my point.
