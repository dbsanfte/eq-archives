I know I know... but as well as being probably the most impatient person in
EQ.. if im trying to make mana, making some mana only to spend some of that
mana to make more mana isnt what I call optimal.

I hate, i mean HATE downtime.. if the downtime is because my shaman is oom,
I'll start canni'ing, but I'll ask the ranger im grouped with to regen me..
or the cleric to heal me.  if im the only shaman on a raid it means I have
to g.focus, g.sta and g.agi the entire raid.  G.focus alone takes over half
my mana, and whilst im always clicking canni, I at least ask somebody else
to keep me healed.. it speeds up the mana process no end.

Obviously if its just the monk/shaman then I do canni and torpor.. I like to
be lazy though!

Im also a class leader (for monks that is) which means im often pulling, or
showing somebody else the pull.  Can't do that while im constantly clicking
canni on the second comp.

I remember our old ST days (when we used to raid the place every 2 days (i
mean EVERY) for a long long time), we would only have 1 shaman there and
after buffing the groups she would canni down, whilst her "monklings" would
bandage her back up.  It might not have made a super time difference, but it
did speed up the raids (at the same time the clerics were all medding)..
for us ST was a place we wanted to be in and out of asap.. all about maximum
efficiency.. even 5 mins added to the raid from the shaman medding was 5
minues too many !!

Our main guildie shaman has Canni 5, and it does indeed kickass (long
re-cast on it though) but remember, im a monk not a shaman.  Getting meem
rapid FD 3, ambi dex, critical mend, all the other aa abilities he has, was
more important (and fun) to me than getting the shaman MGB and Canni 5 asap.

As it stands meems at 125 or so.. my shaman has 4 aa levels, and the cleric
has 9 heh.  Heck who knows, maybe some day both will have MGB, and my wizard
will have manaburn (not likely)...  maybe my mage and SK will finally level
again heh.. (i play something to make it level 60.. not necesserily because
I still enjoy or need the class)

I had about a 2 month break from exping though (maybe an hour here or there
a few times a week.. prior to that it was several hours of solid exp per
day.. every day) so perhaps I will slowly start to get those other aa levels
up.

I also helped a guildie get through level 59 recently.. oh man did i forget
just how bad that level is!
