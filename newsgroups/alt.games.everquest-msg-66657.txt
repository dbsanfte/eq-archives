Are you sure you installed the new textures? On installation it gives
you an option check box with those other boxes as to whether you want
to retexture the old EQ areas with new textures.

I notice a difference even though I have textures set to LOW to use
less memory (and to have all the new models on ;)  ) The main
difference is the detail of the ground.

Don't confuse "all new 3d engine" with "all new 3d geometry." Engine
is just something the user does not actually see which runs/renders
the enviornment. The old world areas have not received a geometry or
3d change at all, but just have higher res textures if you install
that option.

I really noticed a difference in qeynos, the freeport dock, and
rivervale. Wooden things like docks especially have more detail.
Some of the lettering on the signs in the upgraded areas has changed
too, like in freeport the sign in east freeport saying "to west
freeport" is now in a different script like a semi old english font.

The top of this page:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/features.jsp

has screenshots compariing the old textures to after you install the
new.

This is the NEW freeport bank:

Not sure what you expected but I looked at those shots BEFORE i bought
Luclin or installed the new textures. Afterwards I went to the
freeport bank and it is like that.

I suggest loading the old one above into your browser, copying the
link to the new, look at the old one for  a bit then paste in the new
and hit return. The changes are pretty obvious. The wood grain is
higher detail as well as the grain on the stones and the ground has
detail. Note the lettering also is changed on the sign in the way that
I mentioned above.
