wrap *this* around your ego, the majority have decent systems, and we
shouldnt suffer because 10% of the players cant go to 100% clip plane.


I myself run a p4 2.53ghz with 512mb ram, a VERY crappy geforce2 mx video
card(next on list to be upgraded) and a sound blaster audigy2 platinum. I
can run 100% clip plane everywhere but bazaar. and I suspect when i upgrade
my video card Ill be able to handle bazaar at 100% too.

My only point im trying to make, is that those of us who do have the money,
and were willing to spend said money.. deserve the option for better
quality. otherwise whats the point of ever buying anything new.
