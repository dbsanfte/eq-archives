Personally, I like Velious a lot, certainly a lot more than Kunark.  Back 
before they revamped the zones for Luclin the lag and the video in Velious
were both MUCH better than Kunark, at least on my computer.  Nowadays I don't
notice any difference, but nowadays I also have a much better comp.

Once I got Velious I didn't spend any time at all in Kunark, and not much
in the "Old World".
