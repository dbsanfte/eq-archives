Perhaps he knows something that can't be trusted with a bunch of
lefties.

History has been littered with traitors. 

I find it hilarious that Tam "I love russia" Dalyell was asking Tony
to step down.

These whiners also seem to fail understand that in international
politics, one has to support the enemies of your enemies. This says an
awful lot about France.

America will take on Iraq, and it will fuck the government there. From
where I'm standing, it looks as like America's realised that with
dictactors they lose more than they get in the long run. (The ones
that turn become very costly.)

I imagine, women being given jobs in Iran, and Libya suddenly
admitting that they did Lockerbie after all, (despite all the leftie
whiners saying the states changed its target to Libya for political
reasons) has an awful lot to do with the fact that it's clear America
has overcome the inertia. Previously fucking over Gaddafi meant
invading the country, and he wasn't worried. Fucking him over now,
means exactly the same thing, but once they've done Iraq, all the non
democratic governments must be just shitting themselves in case
they're next.

As it happens, I can't see why Russia and China aren't supporting the
US, because long term, democracies cause enormous amounts of trade.
This through food and aid, but because so many dictatorships result in
third world conditions for the people. Countries may be good targets
for weapons sales, but the money you can make from a country such as
Iraq through arms sales, is nothing compared to the money you'll make
in 20 years time, if all the people had money (first world style) to
spend on televisions. Ironically, 20 years from now is when Russia
will be up to speed technologically, it's actually in Russia's best
long term interests in my view to install democracies. They lost the
cold war, partly due to the impractical bollocks that is Communist
Theory, but mostly due to the efforts of firm friends and the like.

From where I'm standing the chinese government, despite still having
massive problems with human rights, stands to be one of the big makers
too, if all the world is rich enough to buy goods. So it surprises me
that they're staying out of it.

It doesn't surprise me that France opposes America, as they hate their
culture, but I thought Russia and China had got over their
disagreements. When you take into account all the non-democracies and
tin pot dictatorships that exist, if you look at what happens, sure
the Russians, Chinese, Americans, France and us, may sell them a fuck
of a lot of arms during the early years, but that then is wasted in
aid, that the lefties say we should forgive them interest payments on,
and also it inevtiably falls, then the people are too poor to buy even
a secondhand car. Half of them living there, also realise how shit
their life is compared to ours, and so boat loads of them turn up,
expecting to be fed.

So I wonder just which little tin pot dictatorship after Iraq's, will
have it's people freed to buy our tvs, in ten years time. Korea seems
to be shitting itself, as does Libya.
