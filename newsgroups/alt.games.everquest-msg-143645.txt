That'd be nifty thanks ^^ Rogue is still 35.  Have sat him, sulking, in 
EC now. :)  Anybody wanting a 35 rogue who giggles with glee over high 
backstabs is welcome to send me a tell *g*  Might have to send Novasina 
a tell as, well, like I said, Taellaar is parked in EC waiting for me to 
drag him around the world looking for groups again :)

Ryou
(and I'm up for any kinda raid)
