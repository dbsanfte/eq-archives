  This part is a little suspicious:

I tell petitioner, "Ok, do you see a hotkey on the screen that says 'Sense
Heading'?"
He replies, "no"

I reply, "Hit the arrow buttons one by one until you see one."

It was a guess, but an educated one.

He replies, "found it"

  If he had bought the character, then there shouldn't have been any hotkeys
pre-made for him, since that information is stored in one of those .opt or
.ini files.  Though it's possible that whoever sold him the character set
him up with those.

  An amusing story nonetheless.
