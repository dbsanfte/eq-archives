I've been in front of a computer at work all day and at home most of the 
time for way too many years to count, and this only happens when I play EQ.  
Even when I quit EQ, I was still in front of the computer, just playing 
other games or programming.  If it weren't for this, I would agree with you 
that a bigger monitor would help in my case.  The only major differences 
between twitch times and non-twitch times are a) what is on the screen  b) 
how much sleep I am getting.

I plan on getting about 8 hours of sleep tonight, which is better than the 
5.5 I'm working on now.  Then again, the best laid plans...

I'm getting a 19" monitor at work very soon.  My wife keeps asking me what 
I want for Christmas, and I tell her nothing... but, maybe this -is- a good 
time to get a 21" for home.  Thanks for the present suggestion!

Of course, I was kinda waiting for the next line of GeForces to come out so 
I could afford a top-o-da-line GF4, but my GF3 has no problems, whereas a 
21" monitor will make a noticable difference over the 17".  Size -does- 
matter.

HONEEEEEE!  I KNOW WHAT I WANT!
