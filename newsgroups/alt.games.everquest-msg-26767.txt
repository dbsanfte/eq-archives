Hehe, roleplay help a LOT.
A newbie halfling rogue on Veshaan was so nice and so good at roleplaying that
me and a friend save all the stuff we get to help her. Still run around with a
HP 5 ring and a Serpentine Bracer for her.
Also had a lot of fun taking her on a sightseeing of Norrath, since she only
been in Misty and Rivervale.
