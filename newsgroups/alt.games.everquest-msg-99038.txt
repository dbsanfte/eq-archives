I didn't set up any port forwarding options on my RT314 at all, so
perhaps you might try wiping any such out.

Are you running a recent firmware? I'm using "V3.25(CA.0) | 5/4/2001".
There may well be an even newer one by now. Seems to me that I've read
where the firmware and user settings can get 'dirty', so you might try
updating the ROM and wiping the user settings (ROM updates usually
come with a 'zero' file).
