I like to do this also, but the hardest part I find is actually getting
newbies to realize that you are doing a quest. If you start out RPing, most
of the time know one answers, until I literally had to spell out what I was
doing, then start the RP again.

Oh, and Bonda, I just noticed you have an AOL email addy.

I'm sorry.
