  So I'm hanging out in with my pals in the safty of our hideout
in Echo Caverns.  I'm kinda pissed off, because I'm a mutant, and
I'm outcast!  At least I've got my buds here to keep me compan...

   Hey!  Someone just shot Charlie in the head with an arrow! 
Damn!  It was that goddamned troll.  Hold on Charlie, I'm with
you!  Ok, the plan is we both swing at him at the same time
till... HEY!  My feet are stuck!  My feet are stuck and some
bitch dark elf in PINK armor is say "Back."  And that troll is
backing up so I can't hit him!  WTF??  Oh, I am SO going to kill
her when my feet get free.

   Come on, come on... Charlie is taking a beating and that
goddamed Pink wearing Dark elf is HEALING that Goddamned Troll
and... Yay!  My feet are free! Hang on, baby, Poppa is gonna
flatten you like... damn...
my feet are stuck again.  And now Charlie is falling down... just
as me feet come free.  It's all that Bitch dark elf's fault! 
Take that you b..  HEY.. the damned troll started hitting ME
now!  WTF!  Hey!  My mother did NOT make a living that way! 
Bastard.

   Ok.. I'll kill him THEN her....

Annie
