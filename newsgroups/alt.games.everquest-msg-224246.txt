    The music one threw me.  I didn't care for any of the answers.  I picked
"classical" because of the choices listed, that would be the one I would tune
in.  But in reality, I don't know much about it and listen to it rarely.  But I
don't even know what "gothic" music sounds like...  Halloween stuff?  

    That listed needed Golden Rock Oldies or Popular top 40 Pop.  Hell, I would
have even picked "show tunes" had that been an option.
