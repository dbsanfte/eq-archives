Bzzt.  Try again :P

There are always exceptions to every rule, and the surest way to win an automotive pissing
contest is to throw lots of virtual money into the pot.

I decry your choice of the ubah rare Porsche 968 Turbo S as unfair competition for a
mass-produced boy toy, model such as the Vette.

I challenge you to name 1 naturally-aspirated, mass-produced 4-cylinder car in the $20-30k
price range that can match wits with a run-of-the-mill, 4-year old  Vette C4.  Hell, how
'bout against a run-of-the-mill Mustang GT?  Z28?

Nope, you gotta pressurize the intake manifold to get the performance out of a 4-banger.
But that DOES NOT mean that I think 4-cylinder cars suck, not by any means.

Here, let's have some fun: name 1 supercharged or turbocharged 4-cylinder car in the
$20-30k range that will compare favorably among my suggestion competition.

Heehee, I can name 2 examples right off the bat - but NO HINTS. :)

And a moment of silence, please, for the Buick GNX ;->

Best regards,
