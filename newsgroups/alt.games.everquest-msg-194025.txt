I was just in Gunthak, and noticed that the lizard drums come in different
sizes and colors.  I assumed the sizes were race based (i.e., you wouldn't
want to put an ogre on a small lizard), and thought the colors were just for
aesthetics ... you mean there's more to it than that?

If I may ask, where were you reading about lizard selection (what comes
standard, and what are options)?  Maybe I can get a 2-door convertible ...
