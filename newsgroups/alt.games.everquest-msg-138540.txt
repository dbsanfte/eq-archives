Thanks for advice!
Very helpful indeed.
I spent a few hours last night soloing in Eastern Wastes (Walrus and
Uthorks) and doing fairly well.  Getting used to the spells and pet
again and gaining back my confidence.

I was quite envious of the Bards, Wizards, and Druids there...finally
saw Quad Kiting first hand! Simply amazing...the time it took me to
take out one- they would drop 2 or 3 out of the 4.

Good hunting!
