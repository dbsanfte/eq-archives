You can change the text colors in the .ini file; the file
"eqmanual_supplement.doc" in your EQ directory has information about the
various settings in your .ini file.

The easiest way to edit the color settings is with an editor program.  I
used Pasketti's editor to set up my text colors, but the web site seems to
be down at the moment.  His home page is at <http://www.cws.org/~pasketti/>,
or you could look on the EQ web sites for other editors; there are several
out there.

Also, using the '`' key will toggle the shading in the text box; that can
make it easier to read the text against certain backgrounds.

You can move the inventory display to another part of the screen to reduce
or eliminate the overlap.

See the manual supplement for information about rearranging the screen and
related topics.

There's a slash command (listed in the supplement) for changing the size of
the text font that's great for the full-screen display mode, but I honestly
don't remember if it affects the text size in the windowed mode or not. (Got
everything set up the way I liked it a long time ago, and haven't fiddled
with anything since...)

You might try different text colors to see if you can find ones that will
make it easier to read the text; not sure what else you can do other than
get a larger monitor or lean closer to the screen.  :-(
