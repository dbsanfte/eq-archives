YOu "gave up" trying to explain because you realized your point was
flawed and decided to backpedal out like a common troll, too stubborn
to admit you just might be wrong. Now you're playing high and mighty,
trying to make me look like the bad guy. I see no "gratuitous insult"
in my reply. Frankly, the statement made IS blatantly ignorant. If
your widdwe feewings were hurt by my saying so, that's your problem,
NOT mine.
