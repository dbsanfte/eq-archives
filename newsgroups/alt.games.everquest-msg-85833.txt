Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I BELIEVE that if you want to call ID
generally useful, monks are the only ones who CAN make it work fairly
consistently (even if "consistently" means 1 out of 5 times).  I BELIEVE
that monks are the only class with both increasable Kick skill AND Instill
Doubt.  And lastly, I BELIEVE that the kick at the end of ID is what
determines if it's successful.

My twink monk is languishing at level 20 or so...for the last 6 months,
obviously I admit that I could be wrong.
