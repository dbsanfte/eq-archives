I'm trying to remember if you were always such a VAK, or if this is a

Oddly, having spent levels 12 to 18 on my current lizard project, I
haven't found one piece of gear that I've equipped which is better than
what I bought with my bone chip and silk money. (The armor that drops
off the better mobs I can kill at my level in Kurns is reinforced Rhino
Hide. Each piece has lower AC than the banded I purchased. I've seen a
grand total of three bronze weaons, inferior to what I have, and the
rest have been rusty or tarnished.) And for level 18, while I had kept
two of my skills maxed up until then, I had only maxed one in level 18
while the other was still lagging behind.  Time will tell if this trend
continues through 19. I think your statement is a generalization, and my
experience hasn't been consistent with that so far.
