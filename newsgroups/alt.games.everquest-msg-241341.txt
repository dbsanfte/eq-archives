Yes, I'm aware uber is a borderline troll... but even so I have to
agree with this complaint. I have no real objection to needing a 3
person group to obtain leadership xp...

However, a 2 man group should still benefit from a leaders abilities,
and no its not just regen, everything from mark to show npc health, to
spell awareness... duos would benefit from all.

Hell spell awareness at least should work even if you are solo.
