    At this point I don't even ask for a donation if someone's doing a "drag
to your group" deal. I just accept whatever they give me, and make
judgements about their character based on whether they valued the res or
not. Having some monk give me all 53 plat he has on him is worth as much as
a rich fellow dump 200 pp on me - they both tried.

    I don't go out of my way much anymore to res people who send tells. My
play time is restricted enough that I'm usually busy. I'm ALWAYS too busy to
drag a corpse to safety before ressing it or to go to some god-awful place
like Timorous Deep. If I run across a fresh corpse (yay corpse /con!) on my
way somewhere and I'm not pressed for time I'll check if they're on and res
them if they want it. I don't expect anything for those - they're mercy
resses.

    I'll do it if travel is an issue. When I checked one dead druid's corpse
in Oasis, I saw him in Qeynos Hills. He was level 13. He was getting a res.
Note that if you're anon you can't possibly earn my pity this way.

    You ARE a high-level cleric!!! Welcome to Club Cantankerous! (And they
think it's because we're dwarves. HA!)

    Lower levels (so when Kunark was the current expansion), after I got the
49 res, zone of Lower Guk. Sometimes you need cash for the latest tradeskill
push, and that's as good a way as any to do it. I was also easy about
payment, though - I learned Thieves Cant on one of those trips as payment,
for example. And I still frown on people with click sticks doing the exact
same thing, although that might be because I don't have one and didn't sit
through a Rage camp.

    Amen.
