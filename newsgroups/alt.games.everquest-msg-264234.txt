I don't follow your logic here.

Spam is a plague.
Some mail services have policies that help spammers send bulk mail.
So you... what?  Contribute to the amount of spam flying around by 
leaving your email domain intact, while protecting yourself by using a 
fake name?

What does this accomplish?  The bandwidth is still used, munging up the 
net for all of us.

And -your- email service is getting hit with tons of spam which they 
have to spend time and resources on.

Here's the problem I see with this idea: 90% of spam is coming from 10% 
of the services; most services have features and policies in place which 
prevents spammers from using them (at least to some extent).

If you are using a service which still encourages spammers, then you are 
feeding their behavior, even as you simultaneously try to discourage 
them in general.

If you are using one of the services which discourages spammers, then 
you are punishing them for something they aren't even doing!

If you want to fight spam, it seems to me the simplest step would be to 
move to a server which discourages sending spam.

But you've thought this thru more than I have, maybe there's a point I'm 
missing, or maybe I'm very wrong about the whole "servers which 
discourage sending spam" angle.
