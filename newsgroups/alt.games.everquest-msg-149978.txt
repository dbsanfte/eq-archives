Oh, and one more thing -- if you remember your original
username and password, you can just reactivate your original
account (without having to remember the CD key) by trying
to log into it, then filling in new billing information
when it complains about your account no longer being active.

Furthermore, even if you forget the password (but
remember your account name) you can have the password emailed
to you (presuming you still have the email address you
registered with the account way back when) by going to the
appropriate "account info" section at www.everquestlive.com
