How much AC are you really sacrificing though?  Lets say you replace a
10AC belt, which means 15AC total, compared to probably around 1000AC.
You are giving up a whopping 1.5% of your AC, not that big of a deal.
Now look at damage output.  A FBSS increases damage output by 22%,
that's a significant change.  Not only do you do more damage, which
means that fights end quick and healers have to heal less, you hit
more often, draw more aggro, and ensure that the mob isn't hitting
other folks.  Now your cleric can watch your health, time CHeals
correctly, and use very little mana.  Or you could just keep the damn
15AC, not be able to taunt, let other people get hurt, force the
cleric to heal all melee types, and think you're helping the team.
Sheesh, I know warriors have low INT, but come on.
Also, item haste stacks with spell/song haste, item haste stacks with
spell/song haste, item haste stacks with spell/song haste.  
I can't believe there are melee folks who don't understand this, but I
had a very similar conversation with an otherwise excellent SK just
last night.  He's got 1200AC and high WIS (he's an erudite) so I
figured he would know, but the FBSS we gave him last night was his
first haste item.
