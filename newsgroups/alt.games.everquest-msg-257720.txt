Not necessarily...

1) Can people not engaged with the mob affect -me-? ie could I have a 
pile of clerics running a CH chain behind me, hitting me for ch every 
second of the fight, not to mention people tossing me hastes, damage 
shields, symbols, runes, stat buffs... etc etc etc

2) If that can happen, then is the cleric immune from pulling aggro 
since I can't engage the mob? ie I can drag my 39th level Complete 
healing cleric along with my 65 group, and there is no chance of him 
pulling aggro as long as he isn't grouped... 

3) What happens if I -do- 'call for help'? Can the help do 49% damage 
and still give me the xp? Can the raid destroy it and random off the 
loot. (ie if the point of killing the mob is to get its loot not the xp, 
can I just call for help and have everyone zerg it like they do now ... 
ie the developers have no control over how many people are fighting if 
the puller can just 'call for help')
