But 50's not a hell level, so it's not all that bad.
I breezed through 50 pretty quickly, personally.

Hell no.  Many post 50 levels are hell levels, or "quadruple hell".
Doing level fifty 18 times is a hell of a lot easier than "level to
59 and then level 18 times more".

Not only that, but as you climb higher in actual levels, you get
bigger bites of exp from every "normal-to-you" mob.  So getting
the number of points of exp to "get through 50" at, say, 58 is
faster than trying to do it *at* 50.

They're long term projects, not overnight gratification.
