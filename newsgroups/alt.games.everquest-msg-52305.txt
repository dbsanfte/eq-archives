There is a way, to do everything you want, but it's through the use of
another program
called Xylobot.
www.xylobot.com

I haven't used it, but many people swear by it.  However, if you get too
sophisticated
and start making your character so that it runs unattended, and Verant
catches wind of
it, your account will be terminated.  I know a guy who has a druid that all
he does is sit
there and med.  If you hail him, he stands up, casts a bunch of buffs on
you, then sits to
med again - all without someone at the keyboard.  Robobuff!   This was done
by using
Xylobot.  I don't know what the character's name is or on what server it is.
