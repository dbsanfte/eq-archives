Here's what I do.  Make two hotbox's

Hot key one.
/bonk say Have you herd of /assist?  Hellow

Target him first.  Ok realy only need one hotbox

The real one  Cal it Ann & Mez

/g Im mezzing %t leave %o alone
/cast 7

This assumes that Mez is gem 7.  This is one of those things that just save
you one step.  One step may not sound like a lot, but add them up and you
could probably have walked around Norath. =)

Wrighting like that should have value to everyone Except the PKing Punk's on
the Zek servers that will never get a life.

I personaly injoyed your story, and hope to see more of them in the future.
Just make sure you tell everyone it's going to be a long one. =)
