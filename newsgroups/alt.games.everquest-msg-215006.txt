It is, admittedly, not a good expansion for a casual player who
doesn't have 2 hours of free time to commit to an adventure but that
still means it's a godsend to a lot of casual players.

At 65, the dungeons do seem to be fairly difficult if you don't have
_any_ DPS classes but that's a far cry from saying that DPS is king. A
group with 4 or 5 DPS classes can tear through the dungeons but they
also have a much higher chance of wiping which costs time. A group
with mainly low-dps Defensive/tank classes still has a good shot at
finishing. They'll take longer to kill stuff but have more of a safety
net when things go wrong. Also, people will learn which adventures
favor each group makeup and plan accordingly.

It's hard to take you seriously about dumbing down EQ when you're
singing the praises of PoV in a previous paragraph. PoV is the epitome
of the dumbing down of EQ, easy outdoor zone that takes almost no
skill whatsoever. The hard part is gonna be teaching the 30 day (PoP)
wonders how to act in a dungeon environment.

I was one of the biggest naysayers about the time limt to the dungeons
but it seems to work pretty well from what I've seen. There are times
that I'd like to have the ability to take a dungeon with maybe a 2 1/2
hour limit for half points. ... for those times when you don't feel
like grouping with strangers and only have 4 people, for those times
when you don't want to be in a hurry or know someone might have to
leave before 2 hours is up, for those times you'd like to try a hard
dungeon where you have no chance to succeed in 90 minutes. 

This expansion hasn't been out for a week yet, I think they did a good
job of initial balancing and who's to say that a few weeks/months from
now they won't open things up a bit more.
