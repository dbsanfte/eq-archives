Someone has a serious brain fart going on.  Worst case would be package
refund (if newly purchased) or refund of any outstanding balance (pre-pay)
including current month.  That's it -- and if they want that, they can
probably call and talk to the customer service dept and get it without to
much fuss...

Unless someone wants to try for some form of "mental cruelty" due to the
"addictive nature" of the game.  In which case it may get EQ classified as
non-healthy and then the kids parents may just pull the game fearing it as
some form of mind control or techno-induced addiction...

Hmmm...  not a bad deal...  Get the kid campers out of the way so the
grown-ups can play... Sue em!  Sue em!

<grin>
