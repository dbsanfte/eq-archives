Greek and Norse gods were not able to be killed by 40 humans afair.  They
killed each other.  To say that there can be no atheists because anyone can
see that there are gods is quite a stretch.  Anyone can see that there are
beings that call themselves gods, but if you have no definition of what a
god is then anyone can call themselves a god.  Atheism is certainly tenable
in Norrath.

If godhood is not immortality/omnipotence then what is it?  How do you
define godhood?  Does it just mean someone that is very powerful?  Is
superman a god?  Or do you define a god as someone who has x number of
worshippers?  Does he then lose godhood when he falls below x?
