I would agree that both places have good prices, but I take issue with
the level of service at both stores.  Best Buy is worse, but they both
suck.  Employees often know jack shit, and depending on what time of the
day you go, the lines are huge because they have a handful of registers
open to service a multitude of customers.

My biggest pet peeve is with Best Buy though.  I despise how they
attempt to make you line up to have your receipts/bags checked.  If its
just me, ok no big deal it takes like 5 seconds.  But on a busy day?
Hell no.  You just made me wait to give you my money, and now you are
going to try and make me wait so you can inspect my purchase?  I dont
think so.
