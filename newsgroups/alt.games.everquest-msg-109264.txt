More important how? In what venue? What if the person really is more
important? What if a third party determines that one person is more
important than another?

Consider a hypothetical situation, where Jonas Salk and two children
are inside a burning building. Salk has just that morning discovered
the cure for polio and knows it will save millions, but hasn't yet
told anyone else. He can either get himself to safety but leave the
children behind, or he can save himself. Would he be evil because he
considers himself more important than the two kids?

The concept of "more important" is so vague and subjective as to be
utterly meaningless in your definition.

>the degree of the evil, not whether or not it exists.

By your first definition above, evil is a boolean value. There cannot
then be degrees of evil. One is either evil or not.
