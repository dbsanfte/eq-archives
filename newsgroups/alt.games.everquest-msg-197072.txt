If you are on stromm its going to be much harder.

As people said, /ooc that you would like a shadow knight or necro to
help you find a corpse. Remember where you are though, there are not
often a lot of those in GFAY since the locals might not be friendly.
They could also be attacked while trying to help you find the corpse.

Outside of that, find the potion merchant or whatever if town who also
has the bone rod. Its a 4 plat or so item which has 4 charges ( I
think) of locate corpse)  Wait until you are down on the ground again
and somewhere near where you might have died. Next, right click on the
rod (which has to have an inventory slot, not be in a bag, I think)

You will then turn in the direction of your corpse. Once you turn, try
not to move except FORWARD. That way you may get to your corpse on
only one charge. If you do, PUT THE ITEM IN THE BANK NOW (the rod)
then you wont have to buy another. Otherwise, if you have to move
around trees and stuff and get messed up, use another charge.

In the future, since level 10, get used to typing 

/loc

before a fight where you might die, like with a wisp. Or if you are
somewhere and something attacks you in passing hit /loc if there is a
good chance it might kill you, such as a hill giant, if you have time.
Then after you die you can see the /loc coordinates.
