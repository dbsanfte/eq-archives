I very much agree.

Agree here too. Being first to a segment does not mean you'll be the
last standing. And those who laugh at the X-box to date will be wrong
in the end. Gates is in a marathon, not a sprint, in that space.

 New investments currently underway are

Absolutely. Scale lets you spread your risk. A small player today has
no hope of competing broadly. The best they can do is make good
product and look for either a new distribution channel, or seek
shelter under a behemoth's umbrella.

Everyone ignores COGS changes and a total revamp of channel realities.
In the early-80s when I was buying games from hobbyist retailers they
were happy to get me in the door of their strip-mall storefront and
personally tell me about Wizardry I for the Apple IIe. They'd played
it. Now PC games are a 2x2 ad in the BestBuy circular, fighting for
life next to the DVD ads.

 In the beginning when you

I was paying $45 in 1983 dollars for SSI hex-based wargames. And happy
to do it. Would I pay $130 for a game now? Nope. Not unless I can play
it on a holodeck.

 But it didn't take long for the COGS to jump

When they finally got some professional business management. And then
the true fans called them weasels. <g>

 And then

It's become like book publishing, which is really a blood-donor
program with a different sign over the door.
