I have a couple of characters at mid 20's and I am looking for a good
place to level them (warrior and cleric).  I prefer not to group
because I cant spend the time required due to RL situations,
constantly find myself playing for half hour sets then have to stop,
grouping with me is not great for others so would not put them in that
situation.  Any Idea's would be appreciated.
