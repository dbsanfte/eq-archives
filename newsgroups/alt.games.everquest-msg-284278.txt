As a casual player that sorta recently returned (2005 after leaving for
semi-good in 2002ish) --

The flags and keys required to do stuff makes it so that a casual
player will most likely not see tons of end game content.  That being
said -- there is always bigger and better content for anyone to see.
You could probably get back in, get into a F+F guild, do some small-big
stuff, and then find out if your server has any open raid groups and do
bigger-big stuff with them.

One of the things I have issue with is knowing that with my current
play schedule and style -- I will never....*NEVER*....see a lot of the
end game content -- but I can still have fun and kill stuff that is
challenging.
