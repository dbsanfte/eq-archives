I cannot answer as to how much faction you actually need, other than I am 
almost certain I was not max ally when I finished mine, but I did all the 
steps, some more than once.

Iksar Broodling, level 1 iksar, one smack and it's dead.  You only need 
to kill one of the golems to spawn him, if all you need is one tear.  Two 
of them will spawn a broodling, one will not, don't recall which is which 
off hand, but, the non DTing one is one of the ones that will spawn the 
broodling.

Should not be a problem, don't get agro with the mage, let shaman die, 
camp, bring in cleric, start fight.  You have 30 minutes until he 
despawns as I recall.

Personally, I would want more there to do it than those two, as they have 
changed things with resists and such some time back, and from personal 
experience, despite what I have seen posted, the mage fire pet is far 
from immune to the AoE.  (yes, the mage debuffed to under 100 FR).  YMMV.
