A necromancer I know escaped from a fight, bandaged himself up as much
as possible then cast Allure of Death before re-casting his buffs. Buffs
back he sold his loot in Shadow Haven then went to the Bazaar and died!
Seems he forgot that Allure of Death was still working thus Pain and
Suffering killed him. 

Cheers Watchman :)
