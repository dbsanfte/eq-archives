There is one other thing that that hasn't been mentioned
(although, given his apparent lack of intelligence,
I'm not sure why I bother) and that is that these
CPU's have a tremendous advantage in floating point
math, but they lose a lot of it on integer operations.

I'm not sure I see much floating point usage in:

1.  x86 code translation
2.  Network code
3.  User interface code

There is one task the client performs that is
inherently both parallelizable and has a large
amount of FP operations - but the graphics 
are already off-loaded to a piece of parallel
hardware with processors designed specifically
for the tasks they perform.
