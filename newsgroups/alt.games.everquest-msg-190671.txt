I have yet to figure out how to prevent this sort of thing. All my characters on
one server seem to have one hat that they share/fight over. If the hat shows up
on the monk, none of the other characters have one showing. The ranger seems
best at snagging the hat, which is impressive, since she's a short little Wood
Elf, but the Beastlord seems to be able to hold onto it the longest (must be the
claws).
