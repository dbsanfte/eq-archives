How rare the drops are probably isn't an issue since the Thurgadin armour
drops from a *much* easier place (Kael) so you should focus on trying to
get yourself into pickup Kael raids while most of the giants are still
blue.  In fact why not hunt at the Wakening Lands zoneline in Kael for xp
and you might get lucky?

As for Skyshrine armour I'd be somewhat uncomfortable joining a pickup
Halls of Testing raid and expecting things to go at all well, expect a fair
percentage of the raid to die running through Siren's Grotto and Western
Wastes for starters.
