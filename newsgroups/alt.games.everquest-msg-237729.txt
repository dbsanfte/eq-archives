It's Taelosian Memophic Staff...
Looks like a REALLY neat 2hb staff, much like the staff that the
priest of discord has been holding all these years, in reality is only
a stat buffing item, adds like +5 to all resists IIRC.

Really great to twink a noob caster with but not that great, since it
has no dmg/dly at all.  It can be held in primary, secondary or range
slots, although it's not visible when placed in range.

Be prepared to have some heart-wrenching offers for this staff.  I
kept getting people asking me to Link the staff.  It doesn't link (ok
I couldn't get it to link) so then they would ask me about it.  A lvl
65 necro offered me, 3kpp for it, (He liked the looks of it)

Anyways you WILL get pestered about it all the time, and alot of
people will holler and call you twink, but it does look REALLY good :)
