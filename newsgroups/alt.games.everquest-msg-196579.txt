I'm not convinced I wouldn't have been a better tank (*well, sponge, really)
with level appropriate equipment.  We aren't talking "tank classes" here,
rangers and monks aren't made all that  sturdily, and don't come from races
with high staminas.  I'm a chain class, ranger is also chain class so
"should" have roughly the same AC, while the monk is a leather class which
"should" have even less AC than me.  I'm a big heavy troll who deliberately
dumped a lot of starting points into Stamina, while they are what: human/half
elf/wood elf/halfling and human/Iksar, respectively.  Only the Iksar could
possibly have racial regeneration like my troll.

I didn't deliberately set out to build a MA shaman, this was a surprise to
me, my intention was to build a soloing shaman, and as far as a grouping
shaman, one with a large HP pool instead of mana pool, knowing I could canna
from HP to Mana as needed.  Regen seemed a vital component of this plan.  The
fact that at low levels, a combination of large HP and high regen makes a
pretty good sponge was serendipity.

That said, I also have to agree with you to some extent, a well twinked
character may be better at things his class is generally worse at compared to
untwinked characters who are supposed to be the best at them.

Then again, I know people who are drastically underequipped for their level,
and worse at what they are supposed to be good at than the "wrong" class
would be.

And I think you'll find that talent and skill also come into play, I've found
in many cases while working with groupmates (and better, with partners) that
I was able to radically improve their game play by making a few suggestions
from the perspective of someone who's either played that class before or
partnered with that class and had lots of discussions about it.  I'm
"twinked" with knowledge about the game and how the classes work and the mobs
react.   There are certainly others who are "better" twinked that way, just
as there are people who have better gear than I ever dream of dropping on my
shaman.
