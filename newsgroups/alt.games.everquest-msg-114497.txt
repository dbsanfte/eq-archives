No way.  I hunted bone binders in FoB and averaged maybe 1.5.  Never saw more than
3, and often saw none.  Right... the approx level 18 black and red ones, not the brown
ones which are about level 6.

I think the best spider silk drops are in East Karana with the crag spiders.  They are about
level 22.  Someone mentioned the spiders near FV, which are about level 36, but I don't
know if they drop normal spider silk.. it might be drachling silk or some such thing.
