So why should he have to pay extra to transfer to a server with other 
characters on it. SOE can 'foot that bill' as far as I'd be concerned. 
(And since we know there isn't even a real cost associated with it 
anywhere near what they are charging... its not much of a bill either.)

No. He's still right. Paying for character transfers is ridiculous. SOE 
has an obligation to solve this problem, and billing the players a 
seriously inflated transfer charge isn't it.
