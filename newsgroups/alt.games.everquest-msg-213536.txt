Another thing ZEM doesn't show is mob difficulty.  Your method of determining ZEM would work great,
but if (for example) in zone A it takes 5 minutes to kill a level 20 mob and med back to full mana,
and in zone B it takes 30 seconds to kill a level 20 mob and med back to full mana, then zone B is
going to yeild a lot more exp per hour if both have the same ZEM.

What mobs are best to kill varies depending on your group/solo character skill set; my bard, for
example, tend to charm or swarm, and wants mobs that hit hard but have few HP.  My druid, who would
quad kite or nuke kite, wanted mobs with low HP, how hard they hit was irrelevant. My warrior wanted
mobs that hit like wimps and had few HP.  My cleric wanted Undead mobs with few HP.... common thread
was that we wanted low HP... except when my bard was charm soloing, instead of swarm soloing, he
wanted mobs that hit hard and had -tons- of HP, the classic "undercon" mobs, same is true of my
enchanter, when he's fighting with a mob pet, he definately wants the most powerful mob he can find
