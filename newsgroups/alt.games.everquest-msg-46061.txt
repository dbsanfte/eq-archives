Well first off, you can buy a velium weapon. Same stats as a fine steel, but
it's magical. It also procs velium shards at lvl 24, but by that time you
should have something better.
As for other weapons, I'm not sure how much a Black Alloy Longsword goes for
on your server, but on Vazaelle I've seen them go for 100pp.
BALS is a pretty good sword which should take you to lvl 30 at least. Stats
are 10/29, +3vs Poison 1hs.

Don't worry about that. Warriors have a damage cap of 30 damage up to level
20. Plus they also probably use 2hs weapons. Try to get one of the velium
2hs swords (again, 6 to 7pp) to get that skill up. It's stats are 12/43 (i
think) which means you hit for rougly 24 damage most of the time.

My twinked lvl 23 warrior uses a Babs, a 24/39 2hs, which normally goes for
350pp or a bit above that. Gives you something to look forward to :)
