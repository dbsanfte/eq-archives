why  would u want  a no drop haste item instead of a droppable haste item?

the  non-quest haste sky  belts are very easy to  get.  all you basically
have to do is show up  on the  raid.

flowing  black silk sash is  easy to get or buy.

hangmans noose in trak doesnt have very good haste btw.

if i  was going for a starter haste item, i would get the fbss.
