I would like to Compliment the Tech Support team of Everquest. Reading this
group I have seen a lot of posts complaining on how the customer service in
this game sucks, well today I contacted them via E-mail because I was having
trouble logging into the game for a few weeks now and couldn't figure out what
the problem was, within 2 hours of sending them my e-mail I received a reply
from them that solved my problem and allowed me to enter the game once again.
My one and only experience in this regard has been positive in my opinion and i
would like to thank Chris Gould
at Sony Online Entertainment CSR for his quick reply and help with my problem.
