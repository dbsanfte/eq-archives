Have not checked with my ranger in quite some time, used to be level 
limited, guess that was changed.  Regardless, for tracking Gore, he will 
want to use the highest level druid or ranger, unless the ranger has 
higher tracking than the druid hardcap.  It's not really necessary to 
sort, just handy, better to have the added range of higher skill level.
