My Necro just got to level 49 over the weekend and is looking for a
couple of Words so he can research his new spells. The Words and/or
spells I am looking for are as follows:

Bond Of Death - Words of Odus & Grappling

Invoke Death - Words of Acquisition (Beza) & Requisition

Lich - Words of Ethereal


Can anyone tell me where they have seen these drop?

Also, if anyone reading this is on the Brell Serrilis server & has any
of the above, could they look up either Sarmandar or Nephandus (my
charachters)? I would love to be able to buy those words/spells and I
have a bit of money to spend...
