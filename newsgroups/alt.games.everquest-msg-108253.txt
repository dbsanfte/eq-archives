Nah, the sirens outside don't see invis.  If your invis holds up, you'll 
make it in just fine.  If your invis falls, and you are reasonable high 
level (level 50 might be cutting it close) the sirens shouldn't give you 
any real trouble... even when they charm and nuke you still usually have 
plenty of time to make it to the zone.

As far as I know Esorpa of the Ring is like GOrenaire only in that they 
share faction... ie, if you are KoS to Ring of Scale, you are KOS to 
both.  I'm not aware of Esorpa having any issues with illusions.
