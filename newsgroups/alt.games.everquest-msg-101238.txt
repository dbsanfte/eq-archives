Again, relative to where you live.  Yes, housing *is* at a premium here, and
they *are* looking at rent controls, these issues hit the papers and are on
the radio daily.  People here are constantly screaming over lack of
affordable housing (not to mention that next to Hawaii, we pay the highest
gas prices in the nation.)  Are you from the US ( the way you say US$ makes
me ask), where so, New York? Because NY City (Manhattan and the like) and
San Fransisco (a huge area generally referred to as the Bay Area) are higher
than we are, but the point is it's still mighty damn expensive.  We (and
when I say "we" I mean *my* family, trust me we are on the cheap end of it.)
are in a cheap apartment for here, with no amenities what so ever and
parking for one car per apartment.  Our children have a cage to play in,
literally a 6 by 15 corner of the parking lot covered from top to bottom
with wire fencing.  It's that or play in the street.  While I am sure that
lots of people lots of places have that situation, I wonder if they are
paying over 25% of their take home salary for it.
