It lists zones by continent though, so you need only look at Odus, 
Faydwer, and Antonica to see the "old world"... and as a double check, 
if you find a zone on one of the other lists, well then its not "old world".

I'm too lazy to look and see where they put these zones, but Ocean of 
Tears and Erud's Crossing should also be Old World, as they were in 
original game and lie between those aformentioned continents; Timorous 
Deep which lies between Oasis (Antonica), Butcherblock (Faydwer) and 
Overthere or Firiona Vie (both Kunark) should -not- be, as it came with 
the ROK expansion... even though it can be used to travel from Faydwer 
to Antonica.
