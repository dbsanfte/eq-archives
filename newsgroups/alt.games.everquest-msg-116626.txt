Thank you all for your responses....
	We started off by zoning in and doing a rampant run to the
North Camp...   well I of course died as well as many others... but
the designated Camp Cleric got out fine and the two FD'ers were good.
Our main cleric has her click stick so recovery was mainly trying to
find corpses of the lost individuals (those that had never been there
and don't know what north is).
	1st day went real well with only one wipe out, our numbers had
diminished by 3 AM, (besides the break in)  and that was on the last
golem.... we called in a brother guild for assistance... and golem
dropped with no issues.
	2nd day went about the same without any wipe out.. and I got a
Dawnfire Mace... Whoot...

Thanks all again

good hunting.
