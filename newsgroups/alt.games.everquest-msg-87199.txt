Really?  Sev?  I know we've dropped him with 15, and we're really not that 
uber.  As in we dropped him with 15 3 days after getting our first warrior 
epic (and after that newly epic warrior left, another story for a 
different day).  
Though we did have a rather heated arguement in /guildchat last night 
about if we should even attempt our VP runs if we don't have 36 logged on.  
I'm getting a bit miffed at the whiners.  We can kill Silverwing with 24, 
have killed Hoshkar with 30, so why can't we do it again.  Clerics, can't 
live with 'em, can't shoot 'em.
