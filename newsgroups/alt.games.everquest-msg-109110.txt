Here's my $0.02 on Allakhazam's:

If it was a lot of money, it would be better to spend the extra time it
takes to gather up all the information from various sources for each quest.
But at $10 for 3 months of service...even saving as little as ONE HOUR makes
the price worth it.  I can tell you, I've saved MUCH more than a single hour
going straight to Allakhazam's over scouring around trying to find who has
the right information for what.

Unless you're really, dirt-scratching poor or are a student or something
with your day time mostly free, the $10 spent for 3 months service is a
pittance compared with what you get back out of it.

Now, for some people, searching around is part of the fun...and that's fine.
But for someone who has a brief, fixed number of hours to play in the
evening, searching around the various sources of information cuts
drastically into play time and Allakhazam's recovers that play time very
nicely.
