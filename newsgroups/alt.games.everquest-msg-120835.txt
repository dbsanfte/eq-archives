I was grinning whilst reading it too ; )

I think the choice of items was brilliant. It is an alternate route to
power - to gain power in focus items you can take an easy route and
sacrifice traditional strengths. It is also a route that actually also
benefits those who have no interest in the "FoH uber road to assholery" game
style. Maybe that is what is generating the ill will? That powerful gear is
now availiable to *anyone* ~ can't have commoners swimming around dirtying
up the pool?

Some of the focus effects are on already Uber gear - some of it is on old
school yard trash, would it really be better to make it <all> out of reach
to the non dragonslaying? The positive side is if you <are> a top end
player - you can get the same focus effects without making huge sacrifices
in stats etc as the "commoners" do.
