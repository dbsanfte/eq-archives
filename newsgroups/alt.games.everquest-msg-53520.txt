It does not bother me. I still find it rude but that does not make it bother
me. People are rude to me all the time in real life but I do not let them
bother me either. Why should it bother you that it bothers other people? It
obviously does otherwise it would not be such a hot topic. Now my question
still stands. Why would anyone absolutely need to inspect someone? Limited
graphics is not the answer. Just because you can not see the earrings why
would you need to know someone is wearing any? I am just curious. Someone
really needs to explain a very good reason for inspecting someone.

Oh and to answer your question. I care! =P
