Wasnt my point, and I guess thats a matter of opinion. I dont consider that
a lvl 1 warrior in full crafted has "got their items legitimately". If you
think that they are still legit despite this, then thats your opinion. I
dont think its clear cut enough to be throwing around insults. My point was
that as a melee class, you *need* (needed?) to twink to have a decent chance
at this game, and that is wrong.
