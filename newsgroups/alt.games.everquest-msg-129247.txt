That's right, but I may have unique views on the subject of stupidity.
Lazyness and ignorance are definately not stupidity. they can be very
frustrating to deal with. Willfull or intentional ignorance
especially.

That's about 90% of what comes in a call center. You do need a handful
of really skilled people, perhaps 5-10%, to handle the odball stuff,
but a talking monkey could do most of the work.

You hit that one on the head. I find company policies more than
anything restrict me from giving customers the type of service they
deserve. The only time I've crossed company policy is when I'm asked
to lie to a customer. You would be surprised how often this is a
problem. "There are no known issues with our product." "We have no
knowlege of a virus on our installation disk.", etc. Working for an
outsource company makes it a bit trickier:

Customer: So, where are you right now?
Me: I'm sorry, but I'm not at liberty to answer that question.

I know that's what he wanted to do but I think he picked a poor way to
do it. I view this type of humor the same way I view racial humor.
It's the same thing and just as inappropriate. If you doubt me,
replace the word "customer" in his post with the racial slur of your
choice.
