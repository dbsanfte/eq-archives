Tracking is great for finding whatever you may be looking for, named mobs,
farming mobs, anything.

Yes, rangers can sort by con, distance, etc and get a much much larger range
to see things.

Under 20, not really much point in bow kiting since the damage you'll do is
lower than if you were to melee in a group.

All depends on the level of the ranger.  If you're not worried about dying
over and over while you try new things, then chances are that you'll be able
to solo very well at most levels.  There are many rangers at 65 that solo in
PoFire with relative ease (and at 10%aa per kill it's great!!)
