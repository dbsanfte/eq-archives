Last year, SOE promised us a bunch of new spell effects.

They introduced some of the new effects on the Test server, and people
thought they were pretty cool.

Then they slowly fitted the new spell graphics engine in along side
the old one but apparently using the old particle effects in the new
engine, at least for some of the spells.  While other spells appear to
use the old engine still.

Well, the state of spell effects seems to have gone steadily downhill:

1) We don't have any of the fancy buff effects that were promised with
the new engine.  What happened to those??

2) We have two engines, and two mechanism for reducing particle spam. 
Neither of which can completely eliminate spell effects if you don't
want to see them at all.

3) Many spell effects are just plain broken.  For example the Fire
bolt spell from a Wizard has no fire bolt anymore.  Gone.  Poof. 
Bards have no spell effect on the mob for any of their DoT songs. 
Nothing at all.

Further, SOE hasn't said word one about fixing any of these things,
though I've bugged most of these.

Anyone else frustrated with this?  This has been going on for months.
