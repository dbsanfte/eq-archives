No, you fight pretty much constantly and get xp, joking and laughing
with your friends while you do it.  But most folks lose interest after
one or two sessions, the mobs don't stand a chance and there's no
actual risk involved unless you decide to add some by being extra
stupid.

Sorry, but if that's all you're thinking about it already is a grind.
What do you do once you've mastered your current set of abilities and
opponents?  The time it takes to figure out how to play effectively
is only a tiny fraction of the time it takes to advance a character
far enough for tactics to change, you're describing the basic, boring,
xp grind, which I have no patience for.  If I wanted to focus on
some tedious problem requiring careful attention to near endlessly
repetitive activity I'd do something healthier than a computer game.
Sadly, what you describe seems to be the norm, tedious and carefully
sanitized boredom punctuated by occasional adolescent dickwaving.
That must be why I solo so much in spite of the inefficiency.  At
least then I'm free to chat with various friends, or go sightseeing,
or just watch other folks play (peoplewatching in EQ = toonwatching?).

Kaev <--- who can't remember the last time he grouped his main for
anything other than helping somebody take down an epic mob
