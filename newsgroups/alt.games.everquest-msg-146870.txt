Compare this with, say, "Do unto others ... "

If you decide you have no problem being killed, then you would be perfectly
justified in killing others. Go suicide bombers!

The facetious point being, I guess, Wiccan killers need to be delusional
to have a clean conscience; Christian killers merely need to be fanatical.
I don't see the big win here either way.

But if you're going to boil your philosophy into less than 20 words, you
shouldn't be too surprised if your new morality soundbite is easily
misrepresented by those with a vested interest in doing so.
