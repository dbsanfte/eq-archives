I recall playing around with this back when leadership first came out, 
and forming the impression that leadership xp was Not fixed, but rather 
was a percentage of your current level.

I can't recall what made me think this, but the test that comes to mind 
now would be to run a level 10 character with leadership on and see how 
many leadership points he gets in a level, and then run one at level 50 
with leadership on and see how many leadership points -he- gets in  a 
level.  (or any two other wildly disparate level characters you happen 
to have handy.

I recall concluding that it was best to work leadership at low levels 
till you capped it out...  but I don't have my notes and can't really 
make any claims to the accuracy of my vaguely recalled conclusion.
