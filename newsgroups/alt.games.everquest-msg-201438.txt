My thoughts precisely - when I log in I have to switch to
Summon Spiked Ring
Summon Glowing Bauble
Summon Sapphire Bracelet
Summon Coldstone
Summon Gift of Xev
Summon Muzzle of Mardu
Summon Blade of Walnan
Summon Belt of Magi'kot

Then I do a HUGE amount of
summoning (including several
sets of pet gear)

Then I swap out the last 3
for -
Xegony's Phantasmal Protection
Shield of the Arcane
Greater Conjuration Earth

Buff my self and pet canni to full
Then swap to
SoFB
FoT
BOV
Pet heal (Transon's)
Pet heal (44 pop one)
Flameshield
Mod Rod
<Swap spot> anything ranging
from summons to recasting my buffs
to Malosini - always embarassing
when I've swapped in a summons and
forgot to swap back in Malosini :/

Thing is, my book is VERY organized,
but they are organized by type -
pg 1 and 2 pet summons
pg 3 and 4 pet buffs and gear
pg 5 and 6 general purpose
(invis, coh, malosini, see invis etc)
pg 7 and 8 NUKES
pg 9 and 10 Buffs 
pg 15 and 16 most common summons
pg 17 and 18 next most common summons

So setting up some of these spell sets
requires many page flips.
