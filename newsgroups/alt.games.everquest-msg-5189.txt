I've hunted shadowed men in West Commons, Lavastorm and Lesser Faydark for
various reasons and found no difference in drop rates (they are in other
zones too).  The patch of shadow was *very* rare though...I would estimate 1
drop in 3 hours of continuous pulls on average.

You didn't mention your levels but the last time I hunted them you needed to
be about level 40 to single pull them, which is easier.

Shadowed men cast hard, as you learned, so prepare for that <G>.
