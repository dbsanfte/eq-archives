All,

Ah, this is where I need to ask. I'm an old OLD player. I've played
off and on since Day One. I quit right before PoP and I just
restarted. I bought PoP and LoY just because I "have" to have all the
expansions. I've always been that way and I've always had character
re-start-itis. Highest level character I ever had was level 20, even
tho I had Velious, Kunark, and Luclin (iirc). I always played in the
"old world" because I've never been anywhere else, even when I had
other expansions. I deleted all my old characters when I quit so I am
starting new. I have a level 11 Shadowknight, Human, on the Rodcet
server.

Now that I've re-activated, I have no idea where to go, since I've
never visited anywhere outside the old world. Even when I was playing
back just before PoP came out, there were some people in Oasis. Now it
is dead. I can solo there but man is it slow and boring. I've been
playing Diablo 2 while I med.

I dont like large groups, just 2-3 people total, but right now, I have
NO idea where everybody plays.

Where exactly should a level 11 Shadowknight go to find other
characters to group with?

Thanks,

Lewis
