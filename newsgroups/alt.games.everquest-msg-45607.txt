Mozilla's Gecko is easily embedible as well. So I found a browser that 
emulates the look and "feel" of Internet Explorer, but actually uses the 
Mozilla rendering engine (Gecko)

"What looks like Microsoft Internet Explorer on the outside, but employs 
Mozilla's Gecko rendering engine on the inside? It's a new open-source 
browser called K-Meleon."

"K-Meleon doesn't require Mozilla to be installed to run. The K-Meleon 
interface tries to mimic the IE MFC interface as much as possible. For 
convenience, it also uses the IE bookmarking system."

lol, get this, even the MSN (Microsoft Network) Computing Central gave 
it high marks:

"Like most of us, you're probably using Netscape Communicator or 
Microsoft Internet Explorer as your browser. But you'll find slimmer, 
faster browsers out there available for the times when you feel the need 
for speed."

"IE users will feel right at home with K-Meleon from the very first time 
they use it."

"The full version is still only 2.85MB; the light version weighs in at a 
petite 183K. The installation took just a few seconds, and we 
encountered no major problems."

"Even if you're happy with your current browser, you should put K-Meleon 
on your 'must try' list for later on."
