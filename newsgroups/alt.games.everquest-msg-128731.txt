Sure - I'll enterain that. In act, I'll meet you half-way.  You get the
Pali's to stop the violance, and Israel will leave the land. In fact,
that was offered (aka Clinton/Camp Davis), and the Pali's said: Sorry,
no-can-do, that involves a peacefull solution (and all they want is havoc)

Again, I'm all game for that.  ...But what will you do assure that
the Pali's will stop the violance ?  For as it stands, the *only*
thing that works is the ole "Cork in bottle" routine: March Israel
tanks into Pali areas and the bombings "stop".  Pull the cork "out"
and the bombings start. Seems pretty simple to me, no ?
16 days now, and no bombings.  ...Time to pull the cork for another test?
