First of all, read Richard Burge's post :)
The best thing you can do now while you're young is to get some skill
in all three arts, like the guide said. Raising them at high levels
when you should not be tanking can be hell, and you never know what
you're going to get a good weapon in. However, odds are that you'll
find a good 1hb before finding a good 1hs, and the 1h weapons free up
your off hand for a shield or stat item. (Basically, you won't get a
1hs with stats until you're 46+ so I wouldn't invest money in a runed
falchion or anything like that)
Once you have a certain skill level in each art, you can get any
weapon without worrying about whether or not you'll be able to use it.

Some druids stop meleeing after 20, some after 30, some (like me)
still occasionally swing at a mob post 40 and hold a weapon rather
than a book or paw. But for the teens and low 20s, porcupine (damage
shield) melee is a nice tactic, a druid with a good weapon in their
teens can do noticeable melee damage even in a group with tanks, and
you won't necessarily want to blow all your mana on killing a mob
through magic alone.

You melee skills cap at (level+1) x 4. Get an 1hb of some sort,
concentrate on 1hb until you hit the cap for a given level, then
switch to one of the others for the rest of the level. When you can
afford a magic weapon or one with stats, start prioritizing that
weapon more, be it 2hb or 1hb.

You won't really be all that different from other classes until at
least 20. From 9 to 13 and from 19 to 23, you have the same healing
spell as a cleric (they are 10% more efficient casting it, though) and
I still do primary heal work at 43. There is also no law saying only
wizards can nuke - if you have mana to spare, toss a nuke now and then
in a group. Nukes just become a low priority if your mana is better
spent buffing, healing, and snaring.
You can always be primary or secondary healer in a group. Starting at
low levels, your special gifts are snare, harmony, strength and damage
shields - you also have skin buffs(AC/HP), which compare to a cleric's
valor line of spells. Later, there's sow and regeneration. Your snare
and root can be used for crowd control, you have stuns, you have dot
spells and AC debuffs (flame lick being the first). And, while you're
young, meleeing in a group when you have plenty mana will make a
significant contribution to damage.

 You don't have to start grouping as low as level 6. Waiting till at
least 8 (meditate) or 9 (more spells, like a damage shield and better
heal) might be a good idea.
