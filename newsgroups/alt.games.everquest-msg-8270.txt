i didn't accuse him , i asked him. Com'on it was highly suspicious-no big
deal to ask. And I let him know that I believed him when he said that he
didn't. Totally diffusing that minor issue.

Its like in quake:
1st guy: u using a hacked pak?
other guy: no
1st guy: ok

> i mean is it a suprise to you

because of what he had said before -yes. He said he didn't take spawns from
people who go linkdead. He said it was disrespectful.

the training remark was just a bit of an angry joke. i wasnt fuming just a
bit pissed off. i didnt train him and went back online and buffed the two of
them with my Rapacious Subversion spell (take 200 of my mana, give 60)

a little more growing up, not a lot m8. i have acted entirely honourably
imo.

btw as an aside, i got a few norrathian 2nd hand car dealers in my notebook
who i will most definately be training (PCs who rip you off for things like
Words). nothing childish about that imo. i wont be giving them evidence to
petition with beforehand of course.
