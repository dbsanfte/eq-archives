Heh, yep, when I re-read my post, I realized the potential
for miscommunication there.  Oops...  :)

I try to avoid the "elitist vs. noob" thing altogether by
always making myself clear.  If my mage summons stuff for
another player, I always take the few seconds it takes to
say, "This will dissapear when you logout."  Why ever risk
an unhappy customer or hurt feelings?

It could be a kid playing his dad's account for a while,
or it could be someone who soloed his way to level 16 in
just a few areas, and still isn't worldy wise, or it could
be someone has very little time left on their corpse timer,
and the extra 2 minutes run from BBM to GFay could make
the difference.

It just seems...polite.  So I'm still with the OP: the druid
should have made it clear the port was to BBM.  I almost
never agree with the elitist attitude, "Sheesh, you moron,
druids wear leather, not robes!  You should have known!
Noob!  Stupid noob!"  That attitude is just obnoxious to me.
