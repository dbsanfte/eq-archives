My Druid is 33.  When grouped, Ensnare hasn't been necessary, but
when root/dotting or fear kiting solo it is nice.  In dangerous
zones (the best kind, heh) I often mem both because Ensnare is
just a tad too quick casting to benefit from Spell Haste.  This
makes the old L1 Snare quicker to cast, which is a great help if
I get lag-jumped at a bad time by a fast mob like a Snow Griffin.
