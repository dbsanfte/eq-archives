I can't figure out if its only Beast Lord pets that are dumb as bricks or
the others as well. While in Black Burrow I assumed it was the dungeon
pathing. I found its not so. When I was making a return trip from Oasis to
Rivervale, all along the way my pet wandered off ( yes I have a hotkey setup
for follow and guard me). He didn't attack or was attacked by any mobs, just
decided that the hotkey commands didn't apply to himself. Hence , wandered
all over the place until I hit the next zone and zoned with me. Do the other
classes have this problem with independently thinking pets ?
