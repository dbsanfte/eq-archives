I would like to start targeting some of my adventuring and/or shopping
towards improving my resists and other stats on my warrior. Ideally, I
would like to eventaully have a couple of "kits" for regular
adventuring, with stuff to switch out if I know I will be facing a raid
against a particularly tough mob with lots of fire/cold/magic attacks,
etc.  But first, I just want my basic travelling/fighting stats maxed
out.
   I am wearing crafted armor for the bracers, BP, gauntlets, and
greaves and most of them seem to have decent stats, though I woudl
certainly be willing to give them up for an upgrade. I have a giant
warriors helm for the head slot, a frost giant beard in the face slot,
and (sadly) a combination of banded/bronze in the other "body" slots. I
have a pair of cougar claw earrings for the ear slots, and for rings I
think I have the reed ring that the Frogloc Realist dropped and some
other +2 AC ring on the other side. That's about it. In the bank I have
a symbol of loyalty to Vox for Cold based mobs.
  Any suggestions of where, as a level 39 (nearly 40) warrior who
regularly travels with a cleric and has access to a good group of like
level people when needed, I should be looking and/or hunting and what I
should target getting? I definitely want the best overall AC and STR I
can get, and MR would be really nice, with some swap out pieces for
other resists.
Thanks.
