When did I ever say that?  Please check out some of my other posts on this
topic.  I am not claiming that Druids can do "nothing else".  I'm claiming
that they have made superfluous a defining (if not THE defining) feature of

Of course not.

It DOES leave us with a GOOD DEAL less that we had though.
