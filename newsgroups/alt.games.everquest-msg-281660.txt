You're running XP without Service Pack 2 and without the XP Compatibility
kit is my guess.  This thread started because when EQ was first 'certified'
to run under XP, Microsoft specifically listed it as 'non-compatable' and
hence the windows key, alt-tab, hardware mouse, and a number of other
directx features were not available.

Sony then made changes to EQ to allow it to be compatible, but it was still
listed under XP as not being so, and hence the need for the XP
Compatibility kit.  However, Microsoft made the change themselves with the
release of SP2.
