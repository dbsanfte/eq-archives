I'm just curious, why do you think you deserve to be GM rezzed? Why don't
you just get a cleric to 96% you and in the same time you will be sitting
around waiting for a GM to show up, you can get that 4% xp back plus alot
more I am sure.

Do you know why it takes GMs so long to show up? Becuase they have to run
around rezzing people who think because they fell off a wall they deserve
it.

You fell off a wall. Suck it up, learn from it, move on.
