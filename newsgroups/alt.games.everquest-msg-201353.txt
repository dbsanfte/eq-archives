I slowly played my druid over the years and finally reached level 29
recently.  Years past, I had no second thoughts about getting the solo
teleport spells to the various old world spots: Butcher, Common, Tox.
But now with Planes of Knowledge being the staple of traveling for a
great majority of the players, would it be worth the bother to even
get those solo and group teleports?  Or limit the number to the focus
points like Knowledge and Nexus and just run to the stones required?
Since I do not twink my druid, I have to stretch my coin to the best
possible purchase and these spells are not exactly cheap.

Thoughts on the matter?
