I believe you can find out for certain if any gms are on at
all by doing using the command line /who all gm count

It won't tell you names, but it should return the number of
gm's online.  count only works with all, and will not return
names, but if looking to see how many barbarian rogues are
on say, if you use who all barbarian Rogue count you should
get a something back that says, "there are X barbarian
rogues online.
