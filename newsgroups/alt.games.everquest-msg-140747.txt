I found a tracker's water extractor in fungus grove.  It was in the
hands of a vendor.  It looks like a pump and has two slots and a
combine button.  I tried putting foraged roots and berries in it but
it gave the can't be combined message.  Just from the name I would
guess it's a way to make water.  I looked on all the sites I could
find for information but no luck.  I kinda figure it's a tinkered item
but couldn't find it listed in any of the site that cover tinkering.  
Anyone know about this item?

Thanks,

Qiset
