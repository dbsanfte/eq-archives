Zone Alarm does indeed work, and with a minimum of fuss.

The pop-up windows occur when Zone Alarm sees a program that it
doesn't already have in its approve/deny list trying to access the
Internet. Once you answer the questions that ZA asks (should I let
program X do this, and should I remember this answer every time),
you'll have no more problem.

One thing to keep in mind is that the EQ executable gets patched from
time to time, and so each time it will appear to be a different
program to ZA. So, after patch day, ZA will often ask you about EQ
again.
