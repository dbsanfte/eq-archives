    Well, it certainly is moving in a direction.  It seems to me that most
if all of these aa's are geared towards making life easier for the upper
end high leveled characters.  Players are going to have plow through at
least 50 or 60 levels before they can earn things such as the extra spell
slot, permanent see invis, and all the other goodies.  Of course, this is
true with any other set of aa's.  It certainly isn't going to dumb down the
game for anyone that is just learning how to play.

   I'm very curious what, if anything, OoW is going to offer for lower
leveled characters.  I thought that the extra spell slot might be it, but
now it seems that might not be true.  My write up for the FAQ when it comes
out might just have to be "offers new zones and aa's geared for higher
leveled characters".  Well, we'll see when the reports start coming back to
newsgroup when the expansion goes live.
