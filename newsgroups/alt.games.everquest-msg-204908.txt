Gobble,

Hey! I used to play on Apoc in the II - IV days ... I quit right as V
was coming out. I was Varnra on there. I made two inter-related zones
on there, Outer Aurvuron & The Buildings of Outer Aurvuron. Basically,
it was the Anti-Paladin city. Do you remember the Zone? I don't even
know if they still have it, but it was fun to make.

Anyway, best wishes!
