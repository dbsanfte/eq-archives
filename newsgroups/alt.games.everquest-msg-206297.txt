I bet you installed EQ, and later, installed an expansion.
I bet the expansion got installed into a different place than
the original EQ you loaded.

Check for something like this:

C:\Program Files\EverQuest

And:

C:\Program Files\Sony\EverQuest

(The "Sony" part may be "Sony Online Entertainment" or something else.)

This happened to me once, when an expansion wasn't "smart" enough to
realize it should install itself into the same place my original EQ
was installed (my bad for clicking Next Next Next through the installer
without paying attention).

I ended up having the same problem you did.  The most permanent, best
fix was to uninstall everything, and then re-install everything, making
sure to tell the expansion to install into the same place as original
EQ.
