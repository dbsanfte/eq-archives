Easy grouping died out in my mid-twenties, briefly came back in my
lo-thirties, and again in my lo-forties (Dreadlands: when you just
want a group, any group...), then faded for good.  It was frankly
rather absurd.  For example, the group that <had> to have a Warrior
for their tank at the FM Giant fort would be the same folks who had
watched me soloing the Giants for the last hour and a half (slow
and painful, but patience, a sharp eye out for wandering goblins,
and my mithril two-hander were sufficient for the job).  Nowadays
it's hard to even get a response by stopping near a small group and
saying hello (it's tough for those 3-boxers to keep an eye on the
chat window, I guess).

Judging by the high proportion of idiots I saw playing Paladins
during the time I did some grouping in DL, it may be as simple a
matter as everybody assuming that any Paladin they don't know is
a clueless PLee.  Now it's worth noting that the other night I
finally got a Seb key and went in with a guildmate who pulled
together a group and then had the misfortune to go LD and not
return.  So I ended up grouped with a total of 8 strangers during
a reasonably successful evening.  I seem to have done allright
(kept the casters mostly interrupted including all attempts to
Gate), judging by the fact that the group broke up when it was
time for me to leave (I figure if they didn't think I was
contributing adequately they'd have cheerfully replaced me instead
of deciding to break it up).  Also learned the Tunare slang for
master looter, we had a "cleric commie" (short for "common loot"
I guess).  Anyhow, maybe my problem is more where I've been
hunting than anything else, there seem to be a lot of caster mobs
in Seb that need stunning.  Our only death at the camp was when
the MA/Puller got dropped by a string of max/nearmax nukes from
a wiz that stopped short to drop bombs on him (happened very fast,
caught everybody off guard, his health dropped from 60% to zero
in two casts).  There was also a chanter frog that single-handedly
had us on the ropes for a bit by mezzing me, the MA, and our
enchanter, but then it learned the hard way that PCs get Wizards
too.

Kaev <--- hoping that things are looking up at last for grouping
