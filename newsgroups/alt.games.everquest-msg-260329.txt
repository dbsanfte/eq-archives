If I had to name three things about the game that were completely broken,
but will never be fixed, which hugely negatively impacted the game... those
would be it.  I think medding in combat was the lesser of the three though.
I can even understand how they screwed up on CH... just not thinking about
the future, and what mudflation would do to that spell after three
expansions.  Slows though... I can't understand how they didn't see what
that would do to the game.   Huge mistake.
