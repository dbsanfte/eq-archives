Well shows ya I don't run it ) But thought client got it to move bar
or it was moved server side.

Anyway no need, xp is down and down hard no doubt and it was a BAAADDD
move. XP was slow enough as it was...now 50's suck even more. Verant
shoulda waited for PoP to do this then at least would have relieved
the high end crunch if its not another Luclin Lag Fest...hmmm time for
a rant

/rant on

Ok right or wrong the luclin zones are a bust for half the people out
there, even those running reasonable higher end pcs. THere is NO
excuse for the lag and other problems (crashing on zone in etc etc
etc) in these zones. Count JPF in this too, its horrible outside the
caves. Thus the reason so many 55-60 still xp in older norath zones. I
dont care if you dont have the problem but I will wager a SCHW about
half or more experience it spades. So in an lame attempt to move
people out of these zones they cut the xp at the same time they jocky
the 50s hell levels, "without fixing the problems that caused this to
occur"!!!

If PoP continues the trend of sloppy graphics performance, (why should
it be any different), the crunch will still exist only worse. See no
one can say do this or that and it will fix your problems because the
problem is not your graphics card, memory, internet connection, or
wind direction. The problem is horrid code, and that cant be fixed on
the client side. You can improve performance by spending considerable
money on high end video equipment, memory, and connection but it just
hides some of the problems till the next "improvement". Sheesh a child
could see this...so why does verant pretend it cant?

/rant off

Sheesh now I am depressed .. going to go kill something blue and watch
my xp bar not move.
