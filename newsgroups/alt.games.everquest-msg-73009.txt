If you want your off hand weapon skill to go up faster, get a faster
weapon, say a gnoll hide lariat (3/20 IIRC) or something of that
ilk.  While your Dual Weild skill and/or the weapon skill of whatever
you have in that off hand are low, the damage ratio of that weapon
is really quite unimportant, what you need are more skill checks, and
that means the lower the delay the better.

Course an even better way to get 1hs to go up would be to put that
1hs in your main hand while working on easy prey, and swap in
your heavy hitter piercer for the real targets.  What a fast off hand
weapon does best is get that vital Dual Weild skill up faster!

Common melee wisdom suggests that you should keep -all- your
melee skills capped out.  You will, in your carreer, stumble across
all manner of weapons, and if you end up with something far better
than your "usual" weapon, but in a weapon form you have neglected,
you have a long hard row to hoe getting skill up.  Better to swap in
less useful weapons when your main style caps out each level, while
working on lower priority targets, that way you only have to suffer
5 skill checks per style per level, practically no effort at all once you

get up a ways and leveling starts to take forever.

Course as a rogue, this is less likely to be critical.. it would take
a stupendous slasher to beat out even a halfway decent piercer
in your main hand.  Still, adding in something like that lariat for
stuns once you get a good dual weild skill, you'll be able to enjoy
occaisional stun procs thrown in to battle... As you adventure,
you may find yourself stumbling across other more significant
proccing weapons worth off hand weilding or even "primary till
it procs" weilding, and you'll be happy you have the skills to
make use of them if you do.

Delay on the weapon in each hand is entirely independant of the delay
of the other hand.  Dual wield is a skill check that comes up each time
your off hand weapon's delay comes up.  If attack is on, and delay is
up, and you succede on your skil check, then that off hand weapon
swings... at which point it checks your skill in that weapon.  As you
can see, with a low dual weild, your off hand weapon won't get
many skill checks!

A high level character with good dual weild can demostrate this
in action, putting a very slow weapon of one sort (say a piercer)
in his primary hand and a fast weapon (say a slasher) of another
sort in his  secondary hand; if you have melee spam "other's hits"
on you'll see him scoring more slash hits than pierces.

Now you try it, with a very low dual wield skill.. even if you have
1hs and piercing -both- maxed out and are attacking greens, and
even if that piercer is twice as high delay as the slasher, you'll
see far more pierces than slashes.
