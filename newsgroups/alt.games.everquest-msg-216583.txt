I don't have any set group.  I go for long periods of time (like, months)
without grinding at all, I like to 2-box and I like to solo (er, liked,
since Sony destroyed that ability), so I never got into any regular group of
the same people.

My "group of friends to hunt with whom my style of pulling is acceptable" is
generally anyone in the top-10 guilds on the server that happens to need a
monk.  People at that level appreciate efficiency with a little more risk
over monotony and no risk.  The level of risk that is tolerable almost
always directly corresponds to what rank the guild they are from is on the
server, with some rather bizarre exceptions in both directions.

And anybody in my guild would gladly (well, gladly might be the wrong word)
let you know that I joyfully take full credit for any wipes I cause.  As a
raid puller for a couple years, there have been plenty.  :)
