Unfortunately this seems to be the norm any more for
mistmoor.  Some group or guild decides to raid the castle,
and rather than try to use invis past all the green stuff,
they just go and slaughter it all, then pull trains and
repeat.  Very frustrating to be a lowbie there any more.  Or
the idiot paladins who don't read up on their ro armor quest
so keep pulling the two gargs that are low level in the lake
area, and then shouting about wanting to buy mistmoore
granite, etc.  Even after shouting it drops inside the
castle not out here.
