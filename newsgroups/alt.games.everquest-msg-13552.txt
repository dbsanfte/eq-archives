"pls" sounds like "pulse" if you say it (well, if I say it at least).

I'm not going to try and attempt what "thks" sounds like, but
something just ricocheted off my monitor.

I disagree. They aren't trying to look cool. Remember, all of their
peers will be pretty much using the same style of abbreviation. The
letters they choose are the ones which produce the closest phonetic
sound to the original word in the shortest space.

Your example of "ty" being fine......?

The first time I ever saw that, I was in Nek forest and I'd just given
a (genuine, I hope) newbie a nice (for his level) piece of armour. It
made me feel good, as altruism usually does (which is why I do it...
and hey, I'm honest).

What do I get back as a response? 

"Oh Wow! Thank you so much!" nope.

"That's awesome, thank you!" nope.

"Thanks!" nope.

"ty" yup.

Took me a couple of seconds to realise that he hadn't done a typo and
that "ty" was, in fact, "thank you". 

I felt totally indignant (and cheated of the warm glowing feeling deep
inside) until I realised that this was probably the closest he got to
showing real appreciation... and at least he *had* shown appreciation,
albeit with only 2 letters.

<shrug>

Horses for courses. It isn't how I would have thanked someone for such
a generous gift, but who the hell am I to dictate to others how they
demonstrate their emotions.
