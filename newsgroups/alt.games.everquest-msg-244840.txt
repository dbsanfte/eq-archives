Livid is a very cool word.

Etymology: French livide, from Latin lividus, from livEre to be blue; akin 
to Welsh lliw color and probably to Russian sliva plum

I like the image of being blue with rage.  Very descriptive.  Like a 
Celtic warrior, bedecked in his battle woad.

And spelled backward, it's one close vowel away from being 'devil'.  I'm 
as pissed as a backward devil!

Add to that that it has all the energy of the 'live' sound at the front.  
It's an active word, it's going places, it's striking out at what angers 
it.

It isn't just marking its territory, like 'pissed off'.

If you're pissed off, go ahead and say you're pissed off.  But I reserve 
the right to be livid, if that's how I feel.  Some days I'm enraged, or 
ired, or irked, or peeved, or angered, or steamed.  And sometimes, I'm 
pissed off, too.  But the full spectrum of my possible disgruntlednesees 
would be incomplete without lividity.
