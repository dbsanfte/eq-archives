I can agree with that.  All I have to go on is what you posted here.  =) I'm
assuming there must have been more to the story other than you being pissed
that someone "legally" beat you to something (no matter how much I might
consider it to be in poor taste, I will never fault someone for playing by
the rules, even if I don't like the results).

So if you find that there was a valid complaint with the system that
required an exception, why do you assume it would never happen again?  If it
would *never* happen again, it's favoritism.  If there's a possibility of it
happening again and requiring an exception, it is just good sense to modify
the existing policy to deal with it.

I wouldn't want to be a part of any company or guild that would make an
exception without investigating whether such an exception indicated a policy
change was needed.
