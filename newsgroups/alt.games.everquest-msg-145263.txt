Actually, they had little intention in keeping church and state apart, the
only desired to prevent the state from interfering with the churches, or
from endorsing an official church.

"We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human
passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge, or
gallantry, would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale
goes through a net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious
people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."
-- John Adams
