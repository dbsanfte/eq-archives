I remember saying a long time ago that the Beastlord is what the Druid class
should of been if done correctly. The druid class is a faulty designed
class. It should be renamed, and the Beastlord should be renamed to Druid.
Verant designed two classes out of the same area of profession. The
Beastlord class is just a sales gimmick imo.
