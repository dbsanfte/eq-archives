}I'd be shocked if most people were as smart as you give them credit for.

I'd be shocked if most people remember which store the scary rat people ad 
is for.  I didn't, until I saw the thread title.  But then, I've never 
been to a Quizno's, and ain't likely to, either.  My choice is for a more 
subtle reason, though.  I can never remember if it's them or that other 
chain with a green and red logo that took over my favorite cafe and made 
it a lousy place to hang out.
