Trouble is, he wants to work on defense and other melee skills... which most
groups won't let a cleric do.  Exp isn't his principle goal here, nor is loot,
although
I'm sure he won't whine about either.

My suggestion would be to get an understanding partner or trio together with
the stated goal of letting him melee... full group of six isn't likely to do
that,
but small groups can be formed for almost any purpose.  Druid or Shaman
partner would give him regen, which helps a lot when you are busy getting
smacked around on purpose.

Trouble is, most clerics overlook their defense skill.  Yes, after 44 or so,
your melee capabilities start to look silly compared to what you could
do by nuking and medding.  But Defense contributes directly to AC,
and clerics are capable of very high AC values.  Most clerics piss away
a third of their potential by avoiding melee entirely, meaning that their
Defense never goes up... I went up literally 200 points in AC when I took
my Defense from 30 to 190 in my mid 30s.  Unlike shaman and druids
(and rangers and rogues, for that matter) clerics can wear plate class
armor, and get AC values high enough to count.

Later, when you are in a group and there's an overpull or Add that comes
in and slaps you around for a while before the group gets it under control,
that AC may well be the difference between a live cleric with his paint
job scratched, and a dead cleric... which probably means a dead group,
but even at best means a CR; oddly the group doesn't have a cleric there
to res you!
