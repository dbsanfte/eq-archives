There is no point to have them in EQ. Races in this game are simply
just not very different at all. The half orc would basically end up
being a troll in half orc clothing, without the regen. 

I think verant is smart to probably not make any more races and have
vah shir be the last hoopla. It was a "cute" race after the ugly
breastless iksar that few people wanted to play. If you take away the
vah shir's sneak, infra and 100 racial safe fall you end up with a
barbarian. It even has the factions of a barbarian for the most part.

There might be a point to race in EQ2 but due to stats
not making much difference in this game its nothing but
cosmetic. An ogre SHOULD be the ultimate damage dealing
and damage absorbing warrior, even a dragon should quake upon seeing
one arrive in full gear backed by some clerics. This is not the case
since they end up being the same as a gnome one. In the same way,
gnomes and halvlings should be able to deal far more precise/rapid
damage and hit the mob better while mobs much larger than them take a
negative to hit them due to their small stature. None of that is the
way it works in EQ.
