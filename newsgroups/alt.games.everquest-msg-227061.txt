So while the 7 warriors compete and spend their hard-earned points on items,
the magician gets handed everything for six months at no cost?  How is that
fair?  If the magician *really* wanted the item, he'd bid, otherwise I'm
just fine with letting it rot (and do, regularly).  :)

No "alt bidding" against mains.  Our bidding goes members-first, and if
nobody interested it opens to apps and alts.

We don't dictate what classes can bid on an item.  If you are able to equip
it, you can bid.  I'm a classicly "AC" monk, whereas other monks in my guild
concentrate on hp or atk.  Nobody flinched when I bid against a warrior for
a ring of destruction or helm of truevision.

We have a guild bank for droppable items.  Granted, not a whole lot of stuff
at my level is droppable so this isn't a huge issue.  To buy something from
the guild bank, you spend the base RP for it.  You can also sell tradeables
back to the guild bank at 1/2 RP to make them available to others.

It's officers calling the raids.  As a rule, due to the fact that we are the
more hardcore players of the guild, we are some of the best equipped and
thus even that much less likely to have any desire to abuse the system. 
Anyone else calling a raid sets up their own loot scheme (which does happen,
as the BoT towers are farmed now and then by a couple groups who just random
NBG).

The valus *are* artificial.  It's called making a system that works.  You
have to balance it so that RP spent is comparable to RP earned.  The base
value for a raid is 1 RP.  If we have 50 people on a raid, 50 RP is earned. 
If we have three items that drop, an SK sword that only one SK wants, a
magician item with only one magician there, and a bard item that one of the
two bards there already has, that's 3 RP spent.  That's inflation.  However,
with base values that becomes 30 RP spent in a worst case scenario, thus
mitigating the issue of inflation.
