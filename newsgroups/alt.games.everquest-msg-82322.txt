AEing will break mezzes.  why that 17 30 monk staff gets ruined post 30th,
because it AE's.

I sort of like wizzies.  if they know what they are doing, it saves alot of
time to have them blasting things.  they can help the exp bar move along
quite nicely.  Better than any other DDer around, because they blast things
the hardest.  Also because they only do a few things, wizzies will
consistently blast.  Unlike other classes that need to do tons of other
things.  its either blast or evac, for casting at least for wizzies.
Definitely as an Enchanter I have no problem with wizzies and think they are
very useful.   Of course if your blasting the mezzed mobs or evacing when no
reason to (generally any class that doesn't know what it is doing fits this
category), you'll wear out your welcome or ruin the group altogether quite
quickly.
