Pretty much all classes are soloing classes at low to mid levels these
days unless you're in Unrest, PC, HK or a high ZEM zone..  You have no
choice, you'll be the only one in the zone.

I've spent about 60% of my time in groups.  About 90% of my groupmates
are high-level players only interested in PLing their highly twinked
alts to PoP levels.  I've tried to get a Guk group together in PoK
many times and have received almost no interest.  Trying to get groups
together in any other zones is useless since they're abandoned anyway.
I've traveled to mid level dungeons many times hoping to find a
pick-up group and 9 times out of 10 I'm the only person there.   The
other  1 time out of 10 is when there's a level 50+ farming.  The few
times I actually meet someone who is relatively new to the game and
make friends with them, they often don't last because they get
frustrated with the things I'm ranting about and quit.

I've never seen this mentality.  It's more like "I want to level my
alt as fast as I can so I'm going to  PC or HK.  Already been to
Befallen with my main so it's a waste of time."

Exactly, that's why high-level players love to PL their alts there.

The only places I see people LFG these days Unrest, PC, and HK.  Mabye
a few other place like Dawnshroud and Overthere.  But it's always just
a bunch of alts sitting by the zone point pulling mobs.  And since 10
players is considered crowded for an average zone these days and I
almost always get an invite, I don't think the class matters much.

I often hear players ranting about toons that suck on raids and how
they can tell within 5 minutes whether a player grew up in dungeons or
not.  It's kind of tough when you have to go from sitting at the zone
point pullin mobs to high-level raids suddenly.

Because they are alts of high-level players who just want to PL.

No biggie... I've already been in 5 or 6 of them and they don't do
anything.  A couple have attempted to get raid groups together but
only a couple of people show up and it gets canceled.

Yep... Guild issues I never got a chance to learn in kindergarten.
Got to go straight to the pros.

If there was nothing all that different then high-level players
wouldn't be complaining about toons with no dungeon experience so
much.

I'm downloading it now... I'm hoping it makes the game fun again but
I'm already seeing nothing but LFA 50-57 and such.
