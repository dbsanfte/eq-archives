Sometimes when I zone, the server will change ports and Norton (NIS 2003)
will think it's an attack and cause me to lose connection.  I read in the
knowledge base that I should configure NIS so that it allows all udp ports
>1024, but I can't figure out how to do that.  I see that nis has an area to
add http ports (is that the same?), but they must be added one at a time and
not as a range.  Can anyone tell me how exactly to make nis stop blocking eq
from port switching?  I do not want to shut nis down because I know that
operations can continue in the background even when eq is running so I dont
think that is safe.
