I had the exact opposite opinion. I didn't like it at all. I quit 
playing very soon after completing the tutorial and entering Qeynos. 
It's look and feel, play-wise, was so similar to CoH, a game I disliked 
immensely, that I guess my experience was tainted. I got the distinct 
feeling I was playing CoH only centuries earlier.

The characters all have a "sameness" no matter what race or class you 
choose. I spent a bit of time creating my Gnome Mage, got a look I 
really liked and the first "hooded" robe from a tutorial quest changed 
the look I had created completely. Very annoying.

Nothing "caught" me like in the original EQ. I felt no sense of 
adventure like those early EQ days. No sense of being in a world. It 
feels like a video game pure and simple.
