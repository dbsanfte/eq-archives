There are three misconceptions in that position:

1.  That hackers do things for money.  A large number of them,
    probably the majority, do things just for the challenge,
    like the guy whose excuse for climbing a mountain was,
    "because it's there".

2.  That a hacker who was ALREADY sniffing packets (for credit
    card info or whatever) wouldn't be the one to file away
    all the EQ accounts that passed through as well while
    he was panning for gold -- to get screwed, you don't
    have to wait for someone who sets up a packet sniffer
    *just* for EQ accounts.

3.  It probably wouldn't be for "selling EQ stuff on eBay",
    it would be for fleshing out the guy's own EQ character.
    How long do people quest in the game for good items?
    An EQ player with a good hacking background would quickly
    see that it's a HELL of a lot more "profitable" (time-wise)
    to hack someone else's stuff than to get his own in-game
    via quests and camping (and more fun/interesting to boot).

A more likely scenario than the one you describe would be
a hacker who already knows how to get things done, hack-wise,
and is in a position to do it (either with access to a router,
or any number of other "all your data are mine" situations),
who happens to be an EQ player.  Imagine the temptation to
take by hack that which is a pain-in-the-butt to earn within
the game when you already have the means and opportunity...

Also remember that many types of hacks will gain the
hacker not just one password, but hundreds or thousands
if he attacks the right target.  One good hacker can
compromise a LARGE number of accounts, it doesn't take
an army to wreak widespread havoc.

Furthermore, all this focus on high-end hacking has
distracted most of you from the far more common, far more
accessible, far more problematic low-end hacks.  Like,
for just one example, some young hacker-wannabee who knows just
enough to download a keystroke-logger from the internet,
and installs it on his father's/brother's/wife's/whoever's
computer to snarf their EQ password the next time they
log into the game (or on every computer in his dormitory
at college, etc.)

It doesn't take a master criminal to grab passwords,
and even aside from debates as to exactly what percentage
of "I've been ripped off" complaints stem from password
sharing versus not, I think it's safe to say that overall
there are going to be a lot of people out there who have
gotten their EQ stuff ripped off, or bug-nuked, through
no fault of their own.

Consequently, I still maintain that it's a *lousy*
"Customer Service" policy to ban anyone whose account
has been compromised.  What in the HELL are they thinking?

At the very least, they should now change the name of their
department to the "Customer Disservice Group".
