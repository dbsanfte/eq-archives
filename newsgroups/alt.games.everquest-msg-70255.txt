Well, there are the Paladin-only Deepwater Gauntlets...  But I
suspect that won't be much help to you.

Other than that, I don't think so.

But as long as we're on the subject, a handy item along
the same lines is the Golem Metal Wand, from the Steel Golem
deep in the gator pits in Cazic-Thule (it's his common drop).

It has five charges of Pillage Enchantment -- each cast rips off
about five buffs.  They're a lot of fun in PvP.  When I dueled
a guildmate's Shaman, he had spent about three full minutes buffing
himself silly, including SoW and bear form.  The instant we started
dueling, I rapid-clicked the Golem Metal Wand (it's instant cast),
and suddenly he was utterly buffless.  Surprise!
