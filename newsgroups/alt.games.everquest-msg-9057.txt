This quest originates in Ak'Anon with Narron Jenork at the Gemchoppers
Guile, but I don't think you really have to start it there. You need good
faction with the Gemchoppers to complete the quest. There is a gnome guard
named Watchman Dexlin that sometimes spawns at the stone bridge in North
Karana. Bilbis Briar is his placeholder, and he is a fairly rare spawn. Hail
him and he says he's in need of a brave warrior. Say I am a brave warrior
and he will tell you that he is looking for the remains of tiny skeletons.
If you have aimiable or better faction for the Gemchoppers he gives you a
box with 4 slots and tells you to collect the remains (and you will take a
hit with your gemchopper faction for some reason). After he gives you the
box tiny skeletons will spawn between the stone bridge and the gypsy camp
somewhere. They're around level 15. Kill them and they drop a crumpled
skeleton remains. He tells you to return with them before his sundial
reaches 8, and I have been told that if you don't do this fast snough he
will not give you anything for the box, but I am not sure how the timing is
supposed to work. The tiny skeletons are hard to find, they're as small as
brownies so a ranger with tracking would be a big help on this quest. When
you get four and skeletons, combine them in the box and give it back to him.
He will then give you back a box and tell you to return it to Narron Jenork
in Ak'Anon. When you do, he gives you a nice pair of Watchman Boots.

The boots are AC5 STA5 with one charge of SoW.
