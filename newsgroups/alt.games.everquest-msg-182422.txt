Well, the real question is do you want to play in a world where everything
is predictable (e.g. Derv 1 is always going to have 3 level 9-18 critters on
the dervish faction)? Would changing things around make the game more fun or
less fun? On one hand, it might add a sense of exploring the unknown back to
an experience grind. On the other, it might mean that you have to spend time
searching for a good hunting spot cause your old one has been taken over by
something too easy/too hard/wrong faction.

A related question is does the ability to affect the world make the game
more fun or less fun? Would having the barbarians take over BB after it's
been cleared it out for the 10th time in a day be good or bad? It would make
the experience grinds tougher but would it give you a feeling of
accomplishment after a long day of slaughtering gnolls to see the zone
change as the barbarians take it over?
