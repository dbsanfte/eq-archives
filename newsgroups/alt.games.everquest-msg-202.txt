THis situation would be radically different than
the complaint I thought was being addressed.

I've never ever been attacked or seen anyone
attacked before they entered a zone, and
would be shocked to see it happening.

I -have- been killed because I went afk
for a soda while waiting for the load from
a gate, only to find my bind spot was in
the middle of a train.

If you are being damaged before the load
is complete, I'd petition and bug and
report and email verant and otherwise
bug the crap out of them till they boot
you out of the game.

Try this, open log, start the port, do
a /time, then take a screenshot.  On
arrival immediately take another
screen shot.  If you can capture a
seriously dinged damage bar with
no mobs hitting you, you will have the
sort of backup that will probably
be required before anyone takes this
seriously.  Still won't be proof, as I
can think of several ways to fake these
pics, but at least it would be indicative.
