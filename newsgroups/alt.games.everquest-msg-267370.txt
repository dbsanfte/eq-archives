Undesired.

The various incarnations of D&D / AD&D all live together in
rec.games.frp.dnd, I see no reason why this group needs to splinter.

It's already been done before, after all, with an assortment of
a.g.e.thisthattheother in existence.  Relatively few people use them,
as far as I recall.

Simply marking which game you're discussing should be more than
sufficient, and it allows those of us who still play both to gather
material more easily.  Also, face it, sooner or later EQ1 will die.
Or perchance EQ2 will tank.  Maybe both.  I believe that 1 week is
hardly sufficient time to decide that we *must* split the newsgroup.
