Jazz, Found this on Illia's Beastiary:  True Spirit Faction
Link is:  http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=181

I was planning on advancing my epic when I got stopped at Camin in Erudin
with an apprehensive faction. Went to all website and all I found to raise
my faction with True Spirit was a post about the shaman quest with lesser
spirit on Gormit Island. Verant, however, in their infinite wisdom had
changed some things since the quest was last done and it was not functioning
with camping to get a 15 seconds indifferent faction with all mobs when you
relog.  Being apprehensive to the lesser spirit, I couldn't hail him to
obtain the gem I needed to raise faction. I decided to go around the
obstacle with this old trick.
Most information you will find bellow were already posted. The person who
posted it remained anon for some reason. To whomever that may be, thank you
for the basics of the quest. I just edited his post to match what I did to
raise my faction from apprehensive to indifferent.

1. Ask a high lvl Enchanter friend of yours if he can help for an hour or
two.

2. Take boat to OOT, go to Gornit Island and bind yourselves at loc. p680
n5325.

3. Set up the following hot keys. I numbered mine 1-4 just to make things
easier.
1. /say yes
2. /say he threatened my life
3. /say who are you
4. /say I wish to know more

4. Kill Capt Surestout. He is in the tent. Lesser spirit spawns.

5. Enchanter now charms the lesser spirit. That will make him indifferent to
you.

6. Hail him. Hit your hot keys in order. No need to rush he is charmed. He
should give you a tiny gem.

7. Port you and your Enchanter friend to N Ro. run to N Freeport to the NW
corner of the zone. (Near the building where they sell muffins) Jump in
water swim through tunnel a short distance you will see a break in the wall
with an NPC named Bondl Felligan. His loc is P460, N20.

8. Now follow the order precisely here: 1- Hand Bondl the Gem. DO NOT HIT
"GIVE" BUTTON RIGHT AWAY! If you are apprehensive you will lose gem. 2- Ask
your enchanter to cast invis on you. Once invis, you become indifferent to
him. 3-Now is time to press "GIVE" button.

9. Your faction with True Spirit got better.
You gain party experience.

10. Gate to bind point, repeat. Lesser may still be up for a couple of
trips. Check faction till you are indifferent to Bondl(Remember the spirit
is charmed and will con indifferent to you.).

Final notes. I had to do this quest 6 times to get from apprehensive to
indiff. Binding there helps a lot because of downtime that would be caused
by the boat ride. Once you are indifferent you no longer need the help of
the enchanter to charm the spirit and invis you in NFP. The Enchanter
helping me did the quest along with me. Why not? He is there and has to go
both location of quest. Good faction with someone cannot hurt you can it?J
Thank you Elvorfing (Enchanter extraordinaire) for helping with this quest.

Good Luck to you all

THEN this reply:

Good quest tricks.  But two things.

It doesn't have to be Capt Surestout. Killing any of these 4 will spawn the
lesser spirit for starting the shaman epic:
Capt Surestout (Ocean of Tears)
Blinde the Cutpurse (Rathe Mountains)
Peg Leg (Butcherblock Mountains)
an Iksar Manslayer (Field of Bone)

You don't have to make a macro with all 4 lines. Just the final line to
receive the gem: /say I wish to know more


Hope this helps.
