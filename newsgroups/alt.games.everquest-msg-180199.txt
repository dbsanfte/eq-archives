Dark Elves known in Norse Myth as Dock-alfar/svartalfar, were at one
time white elves that have been corrupted by Loki. There skin is shiny
black with purple or dark blue eyes. But the few that live on Loki's
home plane , tend to be a pale white almost vampirish in color.
They live in Svartalfheim, which is one of the Nine Worlds of Norse
Myth.

Not Celtic, not a goblin, not TSR, not DragonLance.
