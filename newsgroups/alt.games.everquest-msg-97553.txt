    The low level BST twinks on our raids have used their warders to great
success, managing to break about any mez we land. (Why non-pet classes
decided to start a pet class for raiding is beyond me.) They also scoop up
the excess BST/MNK only loot. In terms of what they bring to the raid, other
than lag, we're not sure yet because none of them is level 60 yet. Once we
get one to level 60 and get him Savagery (which looks to be a "must-have"
melee buff), we'll let you know. And we haven't yet had a problem with
warders in big mob fights. Yet.
