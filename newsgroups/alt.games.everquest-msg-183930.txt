Well, a druid soloing nightstalkers camp take some skill. Anyone can 
root/dot it, or even quad them (Which also take some skill), but the art 
of snaring, rooting and killing 6 sow speed mobs at a time DO take some 
skill to survive.

Or chanters, chanters are a GREAT example on who need skills. Got a 
chanter on our server (name withheld for not making her look even more 
stupid, but if you play on Veeshan, you probably know who i mean) who 
got absolutely NO skill or knowledge of the game, and since chanters are 
one of the hardest classes to play, in 2 weeks she was the only chanter 
i ever seen who could sit in DL or KC and shout LFG for 3+ hours because 
everyone knew her and knew she was a total moron.

Or take monks for example. Take skill to FD pull mobs, or even finding 
your way around a new area sometimes. A monk formerly in our guild were 
pulling in ToV, and we had to learn him about Sneak (he had 5 skill or 
so in that), how to correctly FD pull, and he had to learn to find his 
way around the area (reported that someone was there stealing our mobs 
because he had run in a circle and saw our raid from behind).
