>>> They are used for making potion bags.  Potion bags allow alchemists to
stack potions which are unstackable without the bag.<<<

They are also useful to casters to hold regeants. My necro has one, and she
keeps it filled with stacks of bone chips.

20 chips per stack X 10 slot container = fewer trips to the newbie zones to
stock up.
