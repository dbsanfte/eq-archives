Agreed, and I think pretty much common knowlege.

> Or level 60 = 2.23 AA points

I don't get your math here.  I run it like so:

2.5/4.5=100/x  x=1.8 

So level 60 is the same exp as 1.8 AA levels.  

However, the showEQ numbers I've seen indicate a 1:1.62 ratio.

Assuming that the 1:1.62 ratio is correct, then the correct split would be 
38.2:61.8.  Since I can't figure out how to get any more granular than 10% 
increments, 40% AA, 60% regular experience is close enough.  I am willing 
to wager quite a nice droppable item that a 40/60 split will keep the two 
bars moving at almost exactly the same speed.
