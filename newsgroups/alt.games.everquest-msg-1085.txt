It pretty commonly drops off the flying monkeys (Holgresh), in the Wakening
Lands... I was there about 3 hours, and saw four copies of it.... no other
spells unfortunately.  =/

They con low blue/green to a level 50, but they're almost all casters
(wizards, magicians, etc.), so backup is generally needed.

Good luck.  :)
