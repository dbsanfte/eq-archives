Well try this on for size.  My main char is a Bard that I have been
playing for over a year now.  Well recently I started an enchanter
alt.  Now when I play my bard I find myself, when wanting to sit down,
opening my spell book, even going so far sometimes as to type /book. 
It takes me about thirty seconds to realize DOH why didn't I just sit.
