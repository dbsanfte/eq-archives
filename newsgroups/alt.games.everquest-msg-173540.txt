No VoG/SoV would have hurt DPS for sure and yes 240 is max.  At least one
other class has a higher archery cap. /sigh

The 11+4 arrows are nice but have some restrictions (not least getting
resisted).  However effectively keeping Avatar up *ALL* the time makes up
for the no-longer-uber ratio on Primal (disclaimer: never had Ferine on me,
not personally aware of any Shaman who has it even so that doesn't wash).

Bow of Storms is ok as an upgrade to Bow of Doom or something but
absolutely miles away from endgame gear itself and unless you want to
constantly swap in Primal for the BoS to keep Avatar up (and possibly
micromanage your buff slots as well) then you'd be much better off swapping
in Primal for the 32/29 that drops off a Tier 1 PoP mob.

Khal is decent still but Gold Runed Mithril Knife beats it, Dart of
Immobility, Gargoyle Talon,  Bloodbath (perhaps),  Ifir, the Call of the
Assassin weapon will for sure, I'm sure there are more.

Yeah you can use melee 100% of the time, archery is very situational.  How
many times does this have to be explained to sink in?
