Point :) True, those lines WERE too long to be hotkeyed, but I once
watched someone play in paw. His group had to zone, and when they came
back in, a monk was being powerleveled and was clearly busy setting up
phrases for begging sows while he was sitting there.

I had typing lessons in school. Years on MUDs gave me speed but also
more inaccuracies - I'll let typos slip when I am chatting (I sanre a
lot of mobs). Fortunately, I am also fluent in reading typo :)
