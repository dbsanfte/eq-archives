On Morell Thule, TUath and War Crim inals are fighting a guild war.
Full PVP, it's a lot of fun. It goes away in two weeks, and this is
the second week. I would like to do it again.

Well yeah we all agreed full PVP, I lost exp being trained by the
Halas guards, some lost by getting DOTs on them. Both guilds play
Everquest, not levelquest. We are NOT Fury's Edge. We don't level up a
char in a week to 60. That doesn't make sense AFAIAC. I enjoy the ride
up, I don't want to cheat myself out of the fun.

I got a Barbarian with a Serrated Bone Dirk, it procced and procced
and never held. My Gnoll Whip procced and stuck repeatedly, as did my
Retinal Deactivator poison. Of course I got good backstabs in as well.

We all agreed full PVP. No restrictions.
