How does it ruin the environment? It's not someones name that warrants their
actions...actions speak for themselves...I've seen more people with goofy
names that are upstanding players...I've also seen many more complete uber
dickheads with name generator names that ruin the atmosphere of the game by
shouting obsceneties and calling people fags...not to mention things like
training...ninja looting...and being pretty fucking stupid in general...

I just don't see the naming policy being the most important thing on the
list...
