}I'm still 14 AA points from Dire Charm, but I have some questions 
}already... One, is it resistable?

I have not had it resisted yet, unless the mob was flagged uncharmable.
Of course, the odds of a level <=46 creature resisting a 59+ AA ability 
cast by a level 65 character can't be all that high... It may just not 
have happened yet. :)

}And two, if you use it on a creature 
}that happens to be too high for it to stick on, does it become 
}unavailable until it cycles, or does it remain available for you to try 
}again on another critter?

No, it remains available.  However, the too-high level creature it didn't 
stick on tends to take exception to the attempt... The same happens if the 
mob was flagged uncharmable.
