Totally agree, now i can finally walk around in peace without people 
begging me for ports. Hope they added some at all the popular hunting 
spots too, so can can actually go to Sebilis without getting 10 tells 
from people who want ports out.

Oh, not to mention that ill have to spend a LOT less time porting 
guildies around for raids, or having to leave raid to get people.


Just hope theyll add some buff machine NPCs in newbie areas so i can go 
to Kelethin without being begged by 30 newbies waiting buffs.


Oh the negative side, its too bad i cant use my favorite "reject begging 
moron who dont understand 4 NOs" phrase: "Sorry, im a soloing druid, so 
i never bothered buying the group port spells", since the beggars will 
probably take the ports after the first couple of no's.
