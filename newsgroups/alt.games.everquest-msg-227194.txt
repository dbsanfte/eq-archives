Naw the thing is that theres only a limited number of each kind of mission
going out a time. Everyone else is doing slaughters so bam no slaughters for
you to do. I hardly ever do slaughters, mainly do collects and rescues. If a
slaughter would pop sure we would take it but
click-decline-click-decline-click all we get is collects/rescues. Why?
because everyone else is eating up the slaughters so all is available are
collects/rescues. And its the same group every night so if it worked that
way we should get a slaughter every once in a while but we dont and we do
two adventures a night. Anyways I would rather get in a dungeon and work it
than sit in camp clicking a recruiter for 30 mins just to get a slaughter
becaue its *faster*. I have done some rescues and collects in 20-30 mins so
slaughters obviously are'nt the fastest missions.
