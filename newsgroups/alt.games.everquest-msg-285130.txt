It has been a while since I visited the group. Good to see that it is
still around.

RL demanded attention and I haven't been playing EQ (or any other
game) for quite some time now but I am thinking about coming back at
least part time.  When I left I had a 65 druid in the top (or one of
the top depending on who you talk to) raiding guild on Terris-Thule and
a couple of younger toons.  SOE was at its peak subscription level.  I
have the expansions through GoD.  I'm hoping you would be willing to
answer a couple of questions about how things have changed.

1.  I had a level 1 trader sitting in the bazaar with all my money
(about 80K plat) and a bunch of goodies.  I read that she's gone.
Please tell me it ain't so or that there is some way I can beg/grovel
to get her back.
2. Since I don't have the time or inclination to do the dedicated
playing required for a raid guild or getting my druid up to snuff, I
was planning on exploring the lower level (levels 0-65) content.  Do I
need the more recent expansions?  Since the answer to my first question
is likely to be "you're screwed" (and broke), should I go to the
progressive servers?
3. With the attrition and consolidation how hard is it to get into
groups at the lower levels?  How about finding LDON groups?  Should I
expect to have to do a lot of soloing as a casual player?  If so, what
are the good solo classes nowadays?  I assume clerics, chanters, bards,
and rouges still aren't that great.
4.  What's happening with corpse recovery?  Someone wrote that it has
gotten easier and mentioned a guild lobby.  Can you fill me in on where
this is and how to use it and any other feature added in the last
couple of years?  A guild hall where you can buy ports was also
mentioned.  Is that the same place and the guild lobby?
5.  What are these veteran thingies?  Are they permanent?  Are there
options that one can choose from?  If so, any suggestions on what the
most useful ones are?
6.  Are North Freeport and Oasis of Marr gone?  If so, what did they do
with the content that was there like the paladin guild in NP or the
vendor that sold the research book for casters in Oasis or the raft
that went to Kunak?  Are there any other areas that have been
significantly revamped in the last couple of years?  Do they still have
the boats?
7.  What kind of interface changes and new features have been added?  I
pretty much used the standard interface in conjunction with mouse.  My
peers were pushing me to just use the keyboard.  Since I'm restarting
and can develop new habits, what do you suggest?   Do you use the
keyboard or the mouse?  Any tips or suggestions on how to interface
with the game?
8.  Are the spells still hard to find or can you get them all at the
POK vendors .  I seem to remember having to go to the bazaar to find
one vendor for a spell and the far reaches of the moon for another.
