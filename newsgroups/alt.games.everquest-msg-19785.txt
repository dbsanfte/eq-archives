Not in the sense of the "sales" economy, no, but imagine the
morale effect on a relatively young server, where no one has yet
gotten close to acquiring their epic weapon, when a dozen people
suddenly transfer in wearing full Skyshrine quest armor and
wielding epic quest weapons (all of which are No Drop...)

Items on a server should be earned on that server, in order
to maintain the prestige of the high-end items.
