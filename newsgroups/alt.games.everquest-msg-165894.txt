Just built a brand new machine for my wife this week and for the first
time installed XP (home edition). I didn't change any settings from the
defaults picked by the OS during installation, and it runs EQ just fine.

Is there any particular setting you're concerned about that you'd like
me to check on mine? Might help. Or then again, I might just fuck it up
for you worse than it is. ;-)
