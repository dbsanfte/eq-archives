Honestly, the market for ports close to newbie cities is fairly slim.
10pp donation if anything usually. The "big money" ports are places
like DL, CS, WL, and such. Nowhere near newbie cities...

Still, if they provided free access to teleports to all the
druid/wizard ports, I'd only have on thing to say as a level 50 druid:
Thank goddess. No more "moron tells you, 'd00d port plz!11!1 d00d! itz
ur job'"
