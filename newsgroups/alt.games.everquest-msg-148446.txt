When you find that you really do need to worry about resists, it is not
expensive to get some decent resist gear to swap in.  You will take hits on
AC and other stats however.  I paid a total of 650pp or so to get my fire
and cold resists both above 100.  Some of that gear has all resists on it,
some is strictly for fire and/or cold.  I could probably get any one or two
of my other resists over 100 by paying a similar amount of cash.
