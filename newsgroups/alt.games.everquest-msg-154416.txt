"Remove" is worse than useless.  Because it does not clear the
price your item will be back up for sale the next time you do
"Begin Trader", which creates a totally unnecessary opportunity
for you to sell by mistake.  Setting an absurdly high price is
easy and utterly reliable (as Martin pointed out, it's pretty hard
to trust setting the price to zero).  If "Remove" cleared the entry
for the item in your .INI it would actually have value, and it'd
supercede the ridiculous price method because it would be easier
to do.
