Been trying to get the Druid Spell  Improved Superior Camo with no luck at
all.  Seems to drop from the Shardwurm Matriarch in GD, but have never seen
her up!  Does thsi spell drop anywhere else?  From any other mobs?  Is there
a trick (or PH) to getting the Matriarch to pop?

Any tips or info on how to get this spell would be much appreciated!

Thanks!
RH
