A very kind 'wolf' did the same for one of my characters, handed me quite a
bit of plat and said buy something nice... well my girl lives hand to mouth
so to speak, most of her earnings going for food and new spells and she
isn't 'tarted out' at all, having only the basics, a weapon, a shield and
native intelligence. Anyway... pass on your good fortune to another char
just starting out, if you just drop the money on the ground someone who
doesn't need it will probably end up with it.

Just a thought...
