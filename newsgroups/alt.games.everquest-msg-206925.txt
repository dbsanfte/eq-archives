The enchanter will lose no experience when he dies; he can't go below
level 1.  If he is anywhere near the SK, the mobs will want to snack
on him for being such a low level.

The SK will get the same experience as if he was solo; the level
differences are too great between the characters.  Experience can be
shared if the lower level character is within 2/3 of the higher level
character. Get the chanter to 20 to group with the SK. The 20 chanter
may still get level aggro, but a 30 SK has a lot of tools to garb
aggro from the chanter.
