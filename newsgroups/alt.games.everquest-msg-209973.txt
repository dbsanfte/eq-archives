I have heard that faction messages are presented in order of
decreasing magnitude when an action results in multiple faction
changes. I can't confirm it is true, although casual experience 
indicates it might be so. For example killing a frost giant lists 
-Kromrif, -Kromzek, +Coldain, +ClawsofVeeshan in that order, and 
that seems likely to be the correct order in decreasing magnitude. 
So, while absolute magnitude can't be judged, it may be possible 
to get a relative idea.
