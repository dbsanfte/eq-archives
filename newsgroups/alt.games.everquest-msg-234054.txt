Probably not. I'm at 'They couldn't like you any more'
and have killed him a few times and it's only taken me
a few kills to get back to that. The thing is, unless
you're very lucky, it's not going to be just one quick
and painless kill to get the earring. He doesn't drop
it every time. As I said, I've killed him three or four
times now, still no earring.
