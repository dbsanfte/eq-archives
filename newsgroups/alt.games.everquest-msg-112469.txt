What do you mean by "when verant decides it should"?  Are they AWARE then, that
this war is going on?  Do we need to let a GM know or will he care?  
We are only there to get a perfect owlbear pelt.  Everything is green to us. 
I'd buy into the "fun" and "sport" aspect to it if there was ever anyone in the
zone.  
This morning I was the only one there.  Last night during prime time there were
4 in the zone.  Probably 4 or 5 there the day before.  That includes my
partner, me and one other guy also waiting for Owlbears to Respawn.
