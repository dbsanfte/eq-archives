Ok... Ill run with this... of course the tank is gunna taunt, because
he wants to keep the cleric alive, for heals and the possible death..
That is the tanks Job.... as is the clerics job to res said tank,
mage, rogue, beastlord.  
As with all things we have our own opinions... yours nor mine are
incorrect, because they are our opinons.  
I have been a cleric... and it was Always my job to res, of course my
first job was to prevent the need of a res..... even if the individual
I was resing was incompetent... after the res... I would leave or
insist that the individual would be tossed out.
I as a monk would not group with someone if I were in doubt of them
performing their job, refering to res at this moment.  If somone in my
group was a cheese dick and died by fault of their own or not... and
the cleric refused to res the cheese dick... I myself would leave.  If
they resed the cheese dick and he was not removed from the group... id
leave.... 

good hunting to ya DT
