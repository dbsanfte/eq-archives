Yep, mentioned elsewhere in my post the buff extensions do affect them.  
I'm at 25% extension now, which is still just one extra tick, which still 
puts Stoicism lower on the mana efficiency rating for me, although not by 
as much.

On EMarr it's the other way around.  Torpor seen as low as 20 or 25k, 
Quiescense still at an obscene 70k.  I've been working on the research 
pages, I never see the needed ones for Torpor.

It's not a spell I use while I am actually in combat, I use the faster 
casting heals if I am being beat upon.  In which case, at 6 seconds, 
Stoicism is still kind of slow.  OTOH, 2k is perfect for when I am 
canning back mana, or healing my pet, which is what I actually use it 
for.  Even when soloing, if I have my pet, I step back, cast the spell, 
step back into melee range, or, if not using my pet, the mob is rooted 
anyway, so the casting time is relatively moot.  I have enough hp self 
buffed that I can take full advantage of the 1950hp/75% max of Kraggs.  
At level 60, I needed to have a PoTC/G or Aego to have enough hp to make 
it worthwhile.  OTOH, I did not actually have Stoicism until it was 
reasonably useless to me, so, Kragg's was still my best bet.
