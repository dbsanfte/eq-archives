ALL in all it's probably not the best PR move for an atheist cult to dub =
its first offspring Eve. It might look as if they think they're God.

who would have thought.

Besides, the biblical, or even the Darwinian Eve, was the mother of us =
all. The girl whose birth was trumpeted as the first-ever clone would be =
the daughter and identical twin of one of us.

well i guess we should give her the due worship she deserves now that =
you finally have a female god to worship.

Still, the Raelian believers and scientists get credit for their 15 =
minutes of fame and their half-hour on CNN. When Brigitte Boisselier, =
the Raelian bishop and midriff-baring CEO of Clonaid, announced that the =
first clone was born by Caesarian section to a 31-year-old American, she =
had the stage to herself for at least half a news cycle before the =
skeptics weighed in.

Frankly, the company established by Raelian scientists to clone humans =
always struck me as a dubious enterprise. Clonaid? It sounds like a =
cross between a rock 'n' roll fund-raiser and a nose spray.

Clonaid began life as a mailbox in the Caribbean and upgraded to a =
fly-infested lab in an abandoned high school in West Virginia. The =
scientific notes reportedly kept by a researcher didn't inspire =
confidence: ``We went to the slaughterhouse and got some ovaries.'' =
Thankfully, this was when they were doing research on cows, not women, =
but you get the idea.

Sounds like a reputable scientific venture. I think I will put all my =
savings into their stock, that sounds like a wise use of my money. Maybe =
i'll hit it big and can go to Las Vegas and watch the dancing girls.

Boisselier's report that five of their 10 clones were successful strains =
credibility. It took 277 tries to get one Dolly. Her description of the =
other clone babies due to be born offers an all-too-perfect rainbow of =
diversity. One lesbian mother, an Asian surrogate and the clones of two =
dead babies? Where, oh, where is the partridge in the pear tree?

This sounds like a recipe for disaster!

As for Rael and the Raelians, where do we begin? Claude Vorilhon, a.k.a. =
Rael, the French-born race car driver, journalist and author of ``Let's =
Welcome Our Fathers from Space,'' met the 4-foot-tall, dark-haired, =
olive-skinned aliens with almond-shaped eyes near a volcano in 1973.

There, he reports, they explained how our species was cloned from theirs =
(hold the green skin) and would clone ourselves into immortality. We =
would download our personalities and memories into our adult clones and, =
zap, eternal life. I can't wait.

immortality, cool that means I can play the Sims Online forever while =
being repeatedly stung by giant wasps and I won't be able to die? =
Whoohoo!!! Bring it on!!! Sounds like real life Everquest!! I can make =
swords and fight the monsters and get experience and become a god!

Rael is a man of apparent good humor -- which you need when you dress in =
white space clothes, believe that Steven Spielberg stole your story for =
``Close Encounters,'' and wear your hair in a topknot. He remembers one =
of the aliens saying to him, ``Aren't you sorry that you didn't bring =
your camera?'' You betcha.

It would, however, take more than a camera for credibility this time. =
The only way I'll believe in Eve is if I'm personally standing there =
when they take the blood samples and do the DNA testing.

Nevertheless -- you knew there would be a nevertheless -- this story got =
our attention because today's hoax is tomorrow's possibility.

Over the past decade, one offspring at a time, we've learned that we can =
fool Mother Nature. From a ``test-tube baby'' named Louise to a little =
lamb named Dolly, to half a dozen other cloned critters, we've gradually =
created the reproductive technology of cloning.

Now all we have to do is create hundreds, probably thousands of =
defective embryos and fetuses, dangerous pregnancies and genetically =
deformed children to get (maybe) a healthy clone. That's all, folks.

Wow, that sounds like the risk involved maybe worth it. we could use the =
fetuses for stem cell research anyway.

Since Dolly wobbled onto the stage in 1997, we've had plenty of folks =
willing and eager to experiment. Dr. Richard Seed was the first to =
announce that he'd clone himself and have his (post-menopausal) wife =
carry his little seedlings. That blessed event didn't, blessedly, =
happen.

Today, along with the Raelians and their little Eve project, we have two =
other fertility doctors also claiming that they have pregnant women =
ready to give birth to clones. Sooner or later is getting sooner.

So, yes, the story of Eve registers high on the hoax meter. After all, =
Clonaid was designed in the words of its vice president ``to create =
controversy.'' But the alarm is, in fact, long overdue.

A spokesman for President Bush, who greeted Eve without the requisite =
politician's kiss, said soberly that it underscores the need for a ban =
on cloning. He didn't mention that our government deep-sixed just such a =
ban, rejecting an international agreement outlawing reproductive cloning =
to create humans, because it didn't also outlaw therapeutic cloning to =
cure diseases.

At home, a similar all-or-nothing opposition to cloning has created a =
congressional stalemate. Many legislators can't seem to distinguish =
between the promise of therapeutic cloning and the threat of =
reproductive cloning.

Here's what we've learned from this ``dress rehearsal.'' We need a sharp =
simple ban on cloning humans now. Leave the thornier questions of =
therapeutic cloning for another day.

The Raelians want us to welcome Eve into the family. I think we ought to =
raise Cain.
