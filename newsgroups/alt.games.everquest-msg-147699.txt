Dear trolling jackass: people aimed it at you not just because of that
post but also because of this one:

>You and Rastus have just shown how fucken stupid you are.
>I guess your lucky that you didn't know anybody that was killed.
>Because my friend you would be thinking different. I'd like to see you
>and Rastus stand next to Ground zero and shout "who cares".. because
>as far as your comment , that's what it means to me,.. you don't care.

Don't try to snake yourself out of the hole you dug, hypocrite. You
got exactly what you deserved, hell people went easier on you than you
deserved.  You accused everyone who didn't agree with you (starting
with the two names here but not ending with them) of not caring about
those who died a year ago because we don't give a crap whether or not
Verant has a banner for it.

You will never raise above the level of a jackass because of that in
my eyes, and I am sure in the eyes of many others. You don't play EQ
anymore, and suffice it to say you certainly don't add anything to the
group and by your post count, you never did.

Just go. Slink back in that patriotic hole of yours and nurse your
bitterness.
