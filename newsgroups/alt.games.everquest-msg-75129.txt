     It seem that every time I run past the Freeport
soulbinder I see some idiot whacking on him.  For
some reason, the soulbinder is unable to fight back.
The PC can just whack and whack on him without taking
a point of damage.  And whack and whack he must, 
since it seems the SB has a ton of HPs.  In fact,
I've never seen him at less than half health, though
to be sure I don't stick around and watch.
   Is this a phenomena of just the Drinal server?
And if not, does anyone else have a problem with
this besides me?  It pisses me off that some 
inconsiderate jerk would make such a genuinely
useful NPC unavailable to other people so that
he or she (but so far, I've only seen he's doing
it) can capitalize on an obvious exploit.
    I report them when I see it.  I've had the
guide respond very quickly when I do.  One told
me that Verant is very aware of the problem,
and is treating like any other case where PCs
are using an exploit.  Why they don't just move
the SB I don't know, seems like it would be a
very easy thing to fix.
