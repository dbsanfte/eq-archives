The way those things hit a Pal unless he or she is in the upper 30s will
likely be needing root and if that is resisted they are in worse trouble
than a druid who at least can run and get away.  I really don't think this
change helps anyone, and as far as people getting the blade like I said
blades have always been easy to get as they are found on dead gobs all the
time.  If anything it will make it worse on Pals.  Now all they have to do
is lower the drop rate of the blade and you will find yourself with a long
term camp yielding nothing put pain and tedium.  In the long run I think it
is the Pals that will be hurt the worst by this since they will find doing
this quest to be far harder.
