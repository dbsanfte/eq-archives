    The SK did have to do a fair amount of work, including attacking with a
Primal until Avatar procced, then attacking with a JStick until Tash procced
so he could Fear. There were a few Feigns in there, too. Once he got Fear
going, he used one of the big SK weapons that procs a lifetap effect to get
his health back up and keep it up for when fear broke. It was on the big SK
board, whatever that is (I never visited it except for that one report).
