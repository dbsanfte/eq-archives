Incorrect.

When items are returned to your inventory, they go in from the trade
window in the following order:

1   2
3   4
5   6
7   8

It doesn't matter what's in the slot, the slot's contents go in in
that order.  So, if slot 1 has an individual item, and slot 2 has a
bag, then you're getting the item first, the bag second.  If slot 1
has a bag, and slot 2 has an item, then you're getting the bag first,
the item second.

To solve this, ALWAYS put bags in the top slots of the trade window,
individual items in the bottom slots.

Now, you can still screw yourself up if you're showing WORN items and
you don't have enough (or the right size) bag or inventory slots to
take the items back.
