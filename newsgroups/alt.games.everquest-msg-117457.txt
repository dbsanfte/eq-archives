Hey all,
After hearing everyone gush over Firiona Vie, I have decided that I just
gotta give it a try. So my only question is, what one char would you folks
choose to ensure you could always find a group?
I am thinking about trying a cleric, but I guess if they are commonplace I
could try something else. Obviously I want to get the most out of FV and try
to group every chance I get.
Thanks all
Chaos
