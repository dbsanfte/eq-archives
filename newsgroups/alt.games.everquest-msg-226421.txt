I feel like a bit of a n00b right now.  For all melee classes, isn't the
ratio 1 STA = 6 hp?  And so going up 15 in STA (from 174 to 199) should
give me 90 hp, yes? (15 x 6 = 90 last I checked)

Yet my hp most assuredly only go up 72 when I add a bracelet of fortitude
with 15 STA.  So I'm thinking that the cap at which the ratio decreases is
something lower than 200, or the ratio is not actually an even 1:6.  

Anyone know why I'm not getting the normal ratio?  I clicked off all buffs
to make sure my STA wasn't buffed...as I said, this is going from 174 to
199.
