Thanks a TON for all the replies, people.  We have some ver intelligent 
clerics in the NG here.  I've been playing my tank recently, so I'm 
learning that side of the game, and everything you guys said jibes with 
what I have seen from the low level perspective.

One more question, though:

Does anyone dispute Lance Berg's information on using the HP buff to 
refresh itself and heal ( assuming you have the time ) instead of the heal 
spell?  It sounds like a -great- idea, Lance, and I will surely check it 
out.
