First of all thanks to everyone who has helped me in this message board with
my non-stop questions =),  as I try to give my input as I can.  Anyway, I
heard that this quest was bugged back in January.  Has this been resolved
yet?  If so, do you think a 50 Druid would be able to do the entire quest by
himself, or is there a certain part I should have some help with?

TIA, Danny
