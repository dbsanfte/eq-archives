Not as far as I am aware.  As Horus says I believe there was a way to do it
some time ago, if you were grouped with the dead person and didnt leave the
zone, but in that situation you are either going to be next to die or near
his corpse anyway.

So no, rangers cannot track dead things, only the living (and undead :) ).
