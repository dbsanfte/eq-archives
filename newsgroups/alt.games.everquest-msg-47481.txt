The best pet for this is a Coldain, perhaps with some Coldain tracking wolves
added in.

Make sure TBoots are active.

Pull with a nuke

Drag the frostie down to the plains and find a coldain to do the hard work.

Root the frostie and let him duke it out with the coldain.  If he kills the
coldain
don't worry, they make more, nuke to kill the frostie.  If the coldain gets him
running
(the root will have worn off by now) then you get the tricky part:

Root the coldain.

Kill the frostie

Atone the coldain..  If you are a different sort of dwarf mage than I am (it
says
Cleric on my green card) you may want to zone out instead... but then you
didn't
have the means to root the coldain in the first place.
