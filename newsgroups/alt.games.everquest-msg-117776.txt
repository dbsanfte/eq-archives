A couple of possibilities:
Are you sure you had the mob targeted throughout the melee portion of
the fight? (Strange to ask, I know, but it happens. You can sometimes
target a *different* skeleton and not realize it.)
You *have* a warhammer, but did you have it equipped? Don't laugh, I've
gone a good way through a fight without realizing that I still had my
fishing pole equipped.
Were you "ducked"? You can't go into autoattack mode while ducked.
