Posted yesterday by Moorgard in the official Sony forums:


"Yes, it turns out there is a code issue that causes hate to be 
assigned to the recipient of the ward/reactive heal rather than 
the caster. In other words, it's not that druid heals are bugged; 
they are, in fact, the only heals (aside from instant-resolve 
ones) assigning their hate correctly.

Wards and reactives do generate hate on their initial cast, just 
not over subsequent heals like they were meant to.

Now, this revelation probably causes some shamans and clerics 
concern, because they see us fixing this issue and the result 
being that they get pounded on. After talking to designers about 
it, we realize that a huge change to healing aggro probably isn't 
needed, just a more equitable middle ground.

We're going to evaluate the way hate is generated and will likely 
make it so that wards and reactives generate somewhat more hate 
than they currently do, and probably make regens generate somewhat 
less. We don't want any type of healer to be shunned because they 
draw more aggro when healing for the same amount of health. We'll 
also take a look at taunt skills to make sure they're behaving as 
we intend them to.

Keep in mind that healing, like nuking, shouldn't be done with 
impunity. A healer needs to play with strategy, just as much as 
any other class. The priest who pounds the heal keys without 
thinking about it will take a beating, just like the careless mage 
or the thoughtless scout or the witless fighter. Because as sure 
as the sun came up this morning, at the first hint of a healing 
aggro change in the update notes there will be countless "SOE made 
healing useless!" threads, despite the fact that skilled players 
will continue to play their priest classes just fine."
