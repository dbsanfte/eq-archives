Oh, use a little imagination ferkrissakes. I had to go there to pick up
a friend in Qeynos yesterday. I cast West Gate (to WK) followed
immediately by Lesser Evac. This takes you right to the QHills zone
line. You're really closer to Qenos than the druids are at that point,
since they still have to run out of Surefall, zone, and run the full
length of the hills to get to town.
