Several of those mobs that he might aggro if he runs off half-cocked are 
level 55ish and quite capable of harmtouching.  Two or three of those 
equal dead beastlord.  You're much better off with the 
kill-the-one-skeleton plan.  There are one or two greenie skeletons that 
see invis, one at the dock for sure.
