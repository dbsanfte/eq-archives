And yet another time someone puts words into my mouth. Nowhere did I
say anything about SOE. The "right" I'm referring to is more to do
with in-game etiquette. "Community" rules rather than official.

Last time I was there with my 50 druid (which was some time ago), less
than half of them were light blue, the rest were green. Logicly,
there'd be even fewer that weren't green 4 levels later.

They're getting xp AND money. Yes, they're sacrificing some xp, but
they're getting considerably more relative for their level.

How so? Seems they came out with more money and xp in their time
there. So sorry that can't run out as soon as they can pay for a KEI
and go quad Wyverns, that's just a little over their capabilities...

How many even know that lizardmen PH HGs?

Mostly they're there for the combination of xp and money. The xp alone
isn't worth the effort, no, but the combination more than makes up for
the shortcomings. And, yes, they are getting benefit out of the xp.

Personally, I think one of 2 things needs to be done: Either make HG
loot a little less crazy (And, yes, it is crazy for a level 35-ish mob
to be dropping 35pp in coin alone) or make it so all giants are so
rich...
