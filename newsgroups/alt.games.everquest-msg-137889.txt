The exception is graphic changes... Loading an XML is fine and dandy, but 
loading a graphic(.tga) is not. That requires zoning. Also, hotkeys will be 
bugged- any hotkey that is a direct action or combat skill (bind wounds, 
sense heading, thrown weapon, whatever) will now show as #, where # is the 
slot on the sheet it is in. This also is fixed on zoning.
