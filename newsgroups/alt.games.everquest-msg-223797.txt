You can also join the general "Chat here and wait for a raid to be
announced" channel, if you want.

It hasn't been around long enough for many (if any) to finish thier flags
due to that channel, but thats one of the many problems I suspect they'll
have with it, yes.

The raiders there are in it for thier flags and nothing else, and many make
that very obvious...  As one said in the chat channel "WTF, you people are
doing some stupid loot raid??? I need Rydda Dar and Bertoxx!!!"

They'll come to kill (or rather wipe out on) flag mobs, but anything else
and they're not interested.  No interest in doing raids just to get raiding
experience, or to gear up so flag mobs become beatable.   Just the flag mobs
themselves.
