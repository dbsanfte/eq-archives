stop... got a question if you have the time..
so is it ok for a level 30 to buy a KEI from you if they offer to come
to you etc?
I, with my 30 druid, do a search / all ench 60 and look for one not
anon and in a non active zone (read not hunting)  such as the bazaar,
nexus, Gfay, etc...etc..  and send them a tell.
example:
/t enchlevl60innonbusyzone  Pardon the interruption, would I be able
to come to you to purchase a KEI for 50pp?  Please be aware I am to
young to receive directly and would need to group with you to receive
your blessing.

now if this were you, would I be on your shit list, because I'm under
50? or that I sent you a tell directly? or what ever reason?
