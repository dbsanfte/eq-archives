What times do you play that are so odd that there's nobody else around?

That's certainly your call, but I seem to detect a large degree of 
hyperbole in that statement. In fact, in the interview they say pretty 
much that the new expansion is optimized for short playing sessions, of 
less than two hours... And at *no* time (and I play at fairly odd hours 
too, being on GMT) have I found that there's nobody to group with. That 
I wasn't interested in grouping is a different matter.
