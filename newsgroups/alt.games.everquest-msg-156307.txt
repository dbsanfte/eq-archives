LOL. Now I understand why most parents go to this provider, but for most
people AOL just seems limited by what it can and can not do. Of course I'm
speaking on the time that friends of mine used AOL 5.0 and that was just
plain nasty!!  I just couldn't understand why people were limiting
themselves to such a narrow use of the net.  Maybe the new AOL has changed,
but I just can't bring myself to use it.  Seems too restrictive.
