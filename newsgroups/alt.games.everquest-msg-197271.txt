Can't you merely help them get flagged? Why do you have to get xp for 
that? Why would *anyone* have to get any xp? Just help 'em get flagged, 
right?

I agree there.

It obviously has to fall upon the guild leadership to schedule it and 
muster support.

But only until the under 60 people get to 60 and get flagged, right?

It doesn't have to be that way though. If the higher level people in the 
guild so desired, more people could get flagged on a more regular basis. 
They don't so it doesn't happen. That is not the fault of the game's, it 
is a black mark on the character of those who won't help guildmates.
