OK. I think you may have been right about non KOS faction at one time when
the dungeon first changed over. I remember running my mage through there,
who had killed several thousand<?> gobbies, and got an indifferent con from
the new Runnyeye gobbies.

This is apparently no longer the case. I created a halfling druid/karana and
in addition to being attacked by surface gobbies in MT, was crushed by the
first Runnyeye gobbie I crossed paths with.

I created a new Qeynos ranger/Karana and didn't get past the gorge. Mudites
and minos all scowl and KOS, took a 21 point fall damage<lev *is* important>
followed by a 34 pt mino attack and "loading". Never got all the way to
Runnyeye.

Then created an agnostic human enc and ran them up to level 4, so as pointed
out to me I could get invis, and ran them to Runnyeye/MT. KOS to both the
surface gobbies and the ones in Runnyeye.

I realize is isn't perfect, should have got the ranger all the way into
Runnyeye. My point is it is quantity sufficent. You have halfling/Karana
getting killed in Runnyeye, human Karana getting killed from falling and
minos in the gorge, human agnostic enc KOS to both types of gobbies. I am
satisfied that both ranger/druid types and human agnostics will have the
same trouble.

I spent about 6 hours doing all this testing. If you want to test something
else I will take it under consideration. As of now, all my statements stand
as I presented them. I did the testing on Durinal<sp?> which seems to be a
less populated shard. When I passed through Runnyeye on numerous occasions
on E'ci there were high level mobs exactly as I stated on the zone lines.
