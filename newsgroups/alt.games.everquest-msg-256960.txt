For casters.  Non-casters can't go over 305.

There's a separate formula for mana over 200.  Generally, you get a 
buttload more mana for increasing your int/wis by a point up to 200, and a 
trickle for a point over 200.

Still, I raised my int from 315 to 325 last week, and found that it gave 
me 68 more mana.  So not a completely insignificant trickle. :)

Higher int/wis also improves your odds of skilling up on tradeskills much 
more linearly.  So if you're trying to do that, it's much more worthwhile.
