Yup, Gnomes small stature and bald head makes them excellent tanks, but only
when the sun is reflecting off their shiney pallet.
Erm, no a Gnome doesn't make "the best" Warrior or Rogue but if you like
that race, who cares, play it.

Rogues aren't tanks.
Tanks are Paladins, SK's and of course Warriors

Monks and Rangers can fill the role of "meat shield" in the same way as a
druid can be the party healer in place of a Cleric.
Rogues could also do this but as their primary ability to dish out damage
(and they do that well) is to have the mob facing else where, a rogue
tanking is a bit like having a Paladin as primary healer, ok maybe not to
that extreme but you get my point.

CF
6th level, when groups didn't require a cleric, everyone melee'd and healing
involved sitting down for 5 mins :ï¿½)
