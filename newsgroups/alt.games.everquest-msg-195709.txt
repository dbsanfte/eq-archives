My take on this when I found out the overseer of the very "heroic" women
is a woman was one of two things.  1) She herself is small and is
compensating.  2) More likely, she never had any close male friends, but
instead has all sorts of assumptions about men and mistakenly thinks she
is catering to them.

That, or the guys who work under her are just really really stubborn and
odd.  With all my years of leafing through boyfriends' porn magazines, I
find it hard to believe that many guys are attracted to flat-assed,
hunch-back, scowly, balloon-boobed women with eyes as close-set as GW
Bush.  Am I wrong?  o.O

posture
