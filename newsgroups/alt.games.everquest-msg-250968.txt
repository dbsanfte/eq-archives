I agree with the above statements and hereby would like to tell the op
to lick my balls!

I have friends who almost cry when they have to miss a football game, I
have friends who even after seeing the game in real life they still feel
the need to watch it on video and read the paper about it even though
they witnessed it for real.

You are a dumbfuck and it is sad that someone like you thinks they are
some how helping others by bashing what they do in their leisure.

There will always be the 'nuts' of anything including EQ but if someone
lets their marriage fail for an online game well then that marriage must
not have been very good from the start.
