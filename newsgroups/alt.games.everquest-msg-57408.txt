Well it was a year ago but beside that.  Lots of times you see a guy start
a guild thinking, (wow this is gonna be cool)  only to find out its work.
Some guys in turn find out that its more of a hassle than they wish to deal
with and pass it on.  Then you meet the guy who stays guild master just for
the sake of being one.  It doesnt often take much to get these types to
turn over guild.  It was a burden he couldnt handle
