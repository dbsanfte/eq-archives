They don't need to know anything about it - they just need to toss $40
for the software at the local computer store. Many computers come with
the anti-virus software already installed.

The threat of computer viruses and security breaches are one of the
favorite bugbears of the media. The average user *does* know the
threat exists, even if they don't believe it applies to them.

I'm sure you're right about that - and by announcing this position,
Verant has pretty clearly stated that their customers who don't know
about this sort of stuff need to take a few minutes to get educated.

that.
