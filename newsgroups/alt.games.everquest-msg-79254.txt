I am glad to see I'm not the only one with the boat graphics problem.  I hadn't
seen it discussed before and feared that I had a unique problem.  My fear now
is that they will resolve the issue through ATI, and ATI will issue a new
driver.  However, they won't issue new drivers to their partnership companies
such as Gateway.  Which means I'll be stuck thanks to the damned (OEM) ATI
Radeon VE DDR 64mb card from Gateway (which they never identified as such when
I bought it of course ).

Here's to hoping they update their drivers for Gateway ATI cards ;)
