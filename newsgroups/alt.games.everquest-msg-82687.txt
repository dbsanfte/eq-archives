I logged out 4 days ago with my dwarf pally Ankylbytr who was wearing a full
suit of red fine plate armor, carrying a serrated blade and 100plat plus
tailored large bags in every slot full of loot and when I logged in today he
was in a totally different zone with NOTHING. I asked around in Butcherblock
where I CAMPED safely and someone said they saw my corpse in a totally
different area. GM said it decayed so I get NOTHING back even tho it was
their bad. Feel like deleting it all and throwing EQ in the trash right now.
What's the use of working your character up just to have EQ trash all your
hard work? It took me MONTHS to get all that.
