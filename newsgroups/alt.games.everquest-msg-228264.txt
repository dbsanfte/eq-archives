Part of this is that its relatively hard to get pets off things, and 
relatively unimportant to do so right away; since pets in a group with 
melee rarely take any damage, letting them soak up a bit from an add 
doesnt' hurt.  But if people see the pets still in there fighting, they 
get confused as you suggest, and wade back in themselves.

In a regular group with friends I'll be seeing again, I frequently use 
pet to park adds in the same way you use root; heck, I can often solo an 
add with my pet while the group worries about its target.  But in a 
pickup group, its very likely a single well meaning melee will jump in, 
soak up all the damage from that add, splitting the healer's 
attention... and making my heal spells useless: I can heal about as well 
as a druid (pre Incomplete) as long as all the damage is on my pet, but 
a well meaning ranger makes that capability useless.

Same is true for my cleric (root parking) enchanter (mezzing) bard 
(mezzing -and- charming) and of course shaman (root parking again).  I'd 
say at least 33% of the population just do -not- get the whole add 
parking idea, not in any form.  Mezzing, while worst when its broken, is 
probably the one most respected, the more esoteric root parking or pet 
parking are much harder to get over on people.  Beauty of charm parking 
is that at least they can't screw that one up so much, but then again, 
half the idea of charm parking is to deliberately injure the pet as well 
as the mob he's fighting, so both are easily killed, anyone at all 
adding in to the melee (even pet casters) can screw that half the deal.

I had (have) a druid friend (now a shaman) who used to be the best 
parker I know, outdoors.  She'd bring in mobs, root them near us, DOT 
the hell out of them, and run off for more, but somehow always was in 
range as mobs died so we didn't lose exp.  Mobs were all partially dead 
and losing HP still when we'd get to them, much better than mere mezzed 
mobs...and there was always another available the second we killed the 
one we were on, with never a worry about what it would do when we broke 
mez; there was no mez to break, just engage in melee and you were good 
to go.
