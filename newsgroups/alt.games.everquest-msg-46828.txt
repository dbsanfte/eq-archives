I am running XP and everquest won't get past the server page....keeps
disconnecting me.  i think it is due to my SB Live sound card.  Had the same
issue with win98_se until i downloaded the latest liveware for my soundcard
and all was better, unfortunatly there is no liveware for XP and win 2000
liveware doesn't work  :(   maybe gonna have to reinstall win 98 or go to my
buddies house to get my EQ fix for the day
