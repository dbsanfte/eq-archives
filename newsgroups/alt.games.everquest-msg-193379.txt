Hmm the old Brass dilemma...
AFAIK it is only possible to up instrument skills when they are actually
DOING something.
So, you can get skill ups in Wind with Shauri's Sonorous Clouding, cos it is
always working (You stay invis...)
For Brass, you have to be doing damage or affecting something - so higher
level would allow that thar Brass tune which adds haste and such to give you
skill ups.
I say AFAIK as I have ONLY had brass skill ups when playing DDD etc...
whilst affecting mobs.
I may be wrong, but I tried for skill ups when nobody was near, left my PC
on ages and... Nada, Nowt, Nothing, Zero, Zip. No skill ups.

My favourite pace is the Pit in Shar Vahl. By the mushroom shaped rock
formation to teh NW of teh bridge at the south of the pit there is a spirit.
It is affected by Brass, but takes no damage (or too little to warrant
noting, and its untargetable, I think.

Anyway, brass maxxed there in a few hours of playing, and I littered the
area with low level mobs too, nice for newbs for their quests!

Give it a shot!
