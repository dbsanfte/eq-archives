Actually it takes a lot less than one minute. Have you ever even been to
Cobalt Scar?  There are at least 20 Wyverns all with in visual distance of
one another.  On average it takes between 10 and 30 seconds to aggro 4 of
them and have them rounded up.  Feel free to Make a character on the Ayonae
Ro server and i will port you to CS (you no longer need a key), invis you,
and you can watch this it work.

Never have to beg for a Sow, i have Jboots.  The new innate run ability is
another option for wizards who do not have them.  Inever have to beg for
clarity, if an enchanter is there i will take one...if not, it is far from
needed. (At lvl 54 our familiar adds 2 points of regen per tick, Manaskin
adds 1, and our epic adds 3.  that is 6 points of mana regen per tick, equal
to clarity i believe)  Buying food is trivial since the otters on the beach
in cobalt scar sell food and water. And i never buy food/water more than
once a week real life time.  I just stock up on it, i fail to see how you
can call that downtime.  As for your last point there.  I very rarely get
hit. perhaps once in a 6 hour session due to lag or a mistake on my point
and that has never caused me a death.  Infact i dont remember dying from
soloing since around level 45.  The only deaths i have had have been in raid
situation in the Temple of Veeshan, Kael Arena and such.

Get out more? I wont even bother to answer that.

At least i have presented some facts...where are yours?
