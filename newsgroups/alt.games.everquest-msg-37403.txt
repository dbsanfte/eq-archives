    The only alternative with equal or better INT are the Molten Cloak, and
that rare quest cloak that starts in Unrest. The Prince drops this cloak -
he's level 18. Between the time he greens and the time when one could get
the Molten, Kunzar, or Ry'Gorr Oracle cloak is a fair pile of levels, no?

    And the hat you had to hand in to Azzar is No Drop. And drops in The
Warrens.

    Only if someone who's deemed worthy is there to help them.

    That's only part of the issue, Dan, and you know it. (It is a big part,
though. You've seen what folks charge mages to MQ the Pegasus Cloak - you
can imagine what'll happen with restricted phat lewt.) The philosophical
thing that gets folks angry is that the code is counter to everything we've
always thought. If you're good enough, you can achieve your goals in EQ. If
you can't achieve them now, you can work towards them. I can't work towards
that belt - I can only HOPE that people are camping the quest item, and
doing the quest.

    Compare this issue to melee binding. In both cases, other players must
be present and want to take the time to help you, and you can't do a thing
towards your goal until that happens. If I want a port, and nobody is
available, I can walk. If I want my XP back from dying, and nobody can res,
I can start killing mobs again. If I want a bind, or to camp a Coded item, I
MUST wait on others.

    The thought that there's so few alternatives available in EQ that
camping that belt is actually profitable for a level 45 pisses ME off.
