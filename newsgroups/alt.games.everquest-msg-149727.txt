I nearly always group with people who know me. Normally, I ML. That
way I can pickpocket and still split it at the end. If I'm not MLing
(i.e. when I dual bot my cleric,) I'll still pickpocket, then split at
the end when the ML splits.

If I'm grouping with strangers, I try to remember not to pickpocket,
but make a note of how much coin I have when the group starts (almost
always exactly 100 plat,) then check again at the end of group and
split the difference. If people have a problem with me after that
because I acknowledged pickpocketing, then there are enough groups
that need my DPS that I don't need to deal with those in desperate
need of a proctoentemologist.
