Because the are 25 stones each.  IF you got 8 of them you would have to have
your STR at 200 just to carry them, not to mention what goes in them.  They
work great in your bank.  That's what everyone I know did.  6-8 TS's in the
bank and a couple handmade or better backpacks on your toon..  There are
better and much more expensive containers out there, but you have to be able
to make then or buy them and for one buying the tinkerers bag can be quite
dangeros untill you get your character up in level's.
