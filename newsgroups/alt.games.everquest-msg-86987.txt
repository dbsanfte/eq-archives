You will not evade me, Just Jekke <JekkeFILTER@from-nyc.co.uk>:

Well, this one isn't last words, both because I didn't die and because
I didn't say anything, but...

Your target resisted the Fixation of Ro spell.
Prince Selrach Di`zok says 'You will not evade me Celaeno!'
You have been summoned!

The princeling proceeded to punch me a few times before...

Prince Selrach Di`zok begins to cast a spell.
You are stunned!
You are trapped within a whirling wind.  You have taken 100 points of
damage.
You feel as if you are about to fall.
You tell your party, 'whee'
You are unstunned.
Prince Selrach Di`zok was hit by non-melee for 26 points of damage.
Prince Selrach Di`zok hits YOU for 250 points of damage.
You freeze in terror.

First I got to spin around under the ceiling, then I spent the rest of
the fight blind while the prince got killed. Also, I asked a guildie
what she thought of another guildie's Elysian armor while I was
spinning, and I just now while getting this out of the log noticed
that she told me she thought it was *gorgeous* while I was blind :)

Conclusion after the Prince fight:
You told gorndax, 'lesson learened from that... do not try to cast
fixation of ro on prince until he is at least half, and someone else
has fire debuffed him : )'
