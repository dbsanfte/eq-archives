You didn't quite understand what I was saying....
I am talking about the raids I finially do GET to attend.
When I do manage to attend a raid and something drops I would like,
even a badly needed spell... I don't stand a chance  in hell of
winning cause other members have attended a dozen or more previous
raids and have the points.

Some folks don't seem to have a life other then EQ and play all the
time and attend ALL the raids.  I unlike some, I have to go to work
occasionally, and can't schedule EQ around work.  If there is a really
good raid  somewhere and its schedule far enough in  advance and I
really want to  attend, I can take a day of vacation from work.
Hehe..  but can;t do that too frequently.

Thats why I think point system is   kind of unfair.
Some seem to think, the more raids you attend the more guild
supportive you  are, when in  fact it just may be that they have all
the time in the world to attend them. IE... award those types more
points. Those that have a RL to manage are just SoL.

No matter what type of raid it is nor  where its at, I think loot
should be FULL  random with NBG in mind.
That is the FAIREST way to award loot.  That way the casual player
that finially  gets a chance to attend a raid will get a chance at
winning something and those that attend all the raids or a lot more
raids will have MORE  chances of winning something.

Another reason  that point system is unfair is due to the fact that
some characters are played by multiple people.
IE...  husband and wife team that play same character or siblings
playing same character (so character is online practically 24/7) vs.
my character that is only played by me!!
