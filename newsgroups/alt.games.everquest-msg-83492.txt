Well, the only reference to obscurity in the naming policy is the following:

13. Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from popular existing
media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Tanis).

Lokari, clearly violates the 4th guideline.  As to whether or not she would
be forced to change it, that would be up to the GMs on her server.  Mind
you, I don't know who started using the name Lokari first, the company, or
her, and that, perhaps, should be taken into consideration.
