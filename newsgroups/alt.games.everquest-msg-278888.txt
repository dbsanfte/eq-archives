The old hsp [host signal processor] modem (or software modem or 
winmodem) vs "real hardware" modem is just that:  OLD

Yes, it made a big difference in 1999 when you were doing pretty good if 
you had a 233MHz cpu. Back then the HSP ate up 10 to 20% of your cpu, 
which was ok for email or the web but really took its toll on games.  

The important thing to realize is that was 10-20% of 233Mhz... the 
actual processing requirements for HSP are fixed, and do not scale as 
the processer speeds up.

Flash forward several years and the cpu load on even an aged P3-800 it 
will hardly matter... on a modern 3GHz cpu it will barely even register.

In other words, you only have to really care about hsp if you still use 
a pentium II for online gaming. For the rest of us the "cpu hit" of hsp 
simply doesn't matter any more.
