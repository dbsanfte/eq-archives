*chuckle* Sadly, I just couldn't make it quite work in any way.  The top 
works not bad, because it looks like a sleeveless turtleneck jumper when 
dyed dark blue.  But the sleeves won't actually 'dye' white (boo >:(), 
and off shades just look silly.  And the skirt and legs dye the same 
color so I can't make like say a blue kilt and white stockings.  I still 
love the stripper boot look I can accomplish, though :D  Maybe I'll make 
em bright red - too bad vinyl ain't a look >;)
