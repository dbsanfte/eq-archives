Back 2 1/2 years ago or so I was somewhere near the tunnel in EC as I
remember with my first character, a lvl 5 or 6 Wiz, when it got dark.  So I
decided to play it safe and hide in a shed till morning since I didn't yet
have a Greater Lightstone yet.  I sat with my back to the wall, facing the
only doorway in and guess what...  yep sure enough...  bing, bang, bing I
was looking down on my corpse for the 10th or 20th time but this time I
really wasn't sure exactly where I was!  Gezzz what a bummer that was..
never did find my corpse and the couple of decent peices of gear a friend at
work and his sister gave me when I started were gone forever!  Taught me a
valuable but expensive lesson.  Two actually...  mobs can go thru walls and
always try and know where you are incase you die. :)
