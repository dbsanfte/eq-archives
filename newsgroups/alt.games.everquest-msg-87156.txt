You do know that GMs can put themselves in as members of your guild, be 
standing right next to your whole guild, watching your actions, reading 
your guildchat, and you will never know it, right?  Somewhere there is a 
screenshot posted of someone doing a /who after some minor kill, and one 
of the people listed is a GM (not a guide) with a Methods of Madness tag 
after his name.  I know that we never guilded him, and I don't even know 
what he was investigating, but he was there.  Or maybe he just wanted to 
be Uber.  :)
