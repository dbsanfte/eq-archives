Did an ldon last night with chanter (me), cleric, wizard, druid, beastlord, 
and warrior.  Did hard collect and we were levels 52-57.  We moved along 
slowly but were keeping pace in order to win.  Getting towards the end we knew 
it would be close.  The warrior was pulling and he pulled and got a named add. 
 The named could not be mezzed and during the confusion of all switching off 
the normal mob to the named so I could mez the cleric died.  First annoyance 
is the cleric was still bound in POK.  So we have to wait for her to run all 
the way back.  We move slowly without the cleric with the druid 
healing.  Finally cleric shows up and I immediately cast Clarity 2 on her 
since she lost her KEI when she died.  So now we're ready to keep moving and 
finish this when the message in groupsay comes across 'C2 please.'  I said 'Oh 
WOW, you rezzed yourself.'  She just says 'Yup.'  So we just went from being 
able to keep killing to having a cleric with no mana.

End of the mission we have 3 minutes in order to collect one more item.  
Warrior says he needs a paci and I say 'Just Pull them'.  3 mobs come and I 
lock 2 of them down.  1 minute left and finally the first mob dies and the 
looter runs over AND THERE IS NO DROP!!!!  Literally 2 seconds after she 
looted we get the failed message.  We proceed to kill the other 2 mobs I had 
mezzed and they both had the drop we needed.  Certainly bad luck on our part 
for picking the wrong mob to kill of the 3, but also very bad judgement on the 
clerics part.  #1 If she had bound outside the dungeon we wouldn't of had to 
wait 15 minutes for her to get back.  #2 If she hadn't rezzed herself we would 
of had plenty of time.  /rant off  Other than that the cleric did heal very 
well.
