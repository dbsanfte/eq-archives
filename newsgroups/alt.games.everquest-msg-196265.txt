I prefer an enchanter for crowd control usually, but, a good bard is pretty 
amazing to have around.  Up to 3 mobs is not a major problem for a good 
bard to keep mezzed.  Sure, it keeps him from playing other songs, but, 
having one mob beat on the MA instead of 4 more than makes up for that.  If 
you don't find that you, as a bard, are pretty good at CC, you need to take 
some lessons from a bard that knows how to do it.

In addition to CC abilities, of course, the bard also has great songs for 
helping the group out in other ways, haste, attack buff, mana/hp regen.  
This is all from the perspective of someone who has had the pleasure of 
grouping with some awesome bards, not from someone who has actually played 
one.
