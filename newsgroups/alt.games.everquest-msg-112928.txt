Actually, it's not that bad.  Only the exit is perma camped.  Occasionally a
group at the bridge or observer.   We don't camp though, very much prefer to
wander around.

Shhh... they'll hear you.

The Deep is empty.  I guess it's too dangerous for some, heh.   Acryllia
Caverns is another completely uncamped zone, unless an AE group is in there.
Akeva in my experience is always overflowing with players.   Only about 3
groups can fit in there without going into the trapped section or the mind
worm section...  and those three spots fill up really fast.    Tiny hunting
area.
