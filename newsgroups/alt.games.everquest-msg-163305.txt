Yeah. I don't get the KEI addicts. Some druid in Chardok today trained
undead stuff from gate on me just by running from zone in to zone out,
asked a couple minutes later "I didn't train u did I?" and then
proceeded to ask if I'd hold his camp for him while he went to get a
new KEI.
Anyway, my warrior has soloed to 22 and counting with no KEI
whatsoever. So there!
