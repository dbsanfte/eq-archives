Sounds to me like I've been participating in an interesting philosophical 
(and unnecessary) debate because the FAQ is describing exactly what I 
thought the system should be like. When Mark mentioned the need to be 
grouped to recover the shared portion of the debt, I was surprised because I 
wasn't aware of this dynamic. He's either mistaken or the system is bugged 
and not performing to spec (more likely the latter). As I said elsewhere, I 
believe the only portion of debt that should be shared with the group is 
that portion that is not recoverable with the shard, the rest should go to 
just the player owning the shard. If I'm correct about this, and the game is 
operating per the dev statement, then there should be no issue with having 
to be grouped to recover any shared debt (probaby in some part at least 
based on the reasons I offered in my reply to kaev).

The part that throws me off in your snip is the assertion that a party wipe 
should be no more painful than dying on your own. I can't swear that I've 
tested and calibrated this, so I could be wrong about ths, but I've died 
enough times on my own that I'm pretty certain that a party wipe is leaving 
me with more debt *after recovery* than I would have had alone. This might 
also just be bugged right now, there must be 50 ways to miscalculate that 
result. But coming out of a party wipe a couple of nights ago in Vermin 
Snye, I saw quite a bit more post-recovery debt than I ever see when I die 
solo.
