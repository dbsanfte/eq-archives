There will be some skills you won't get till later levels, such as
channeling (level 4), meditate (level 8) and dodge (level 15) where
you will need to put one practice point into so you will learn the
basics, then the skill will go up on its own.  Generally any skill
that you don't get at level 1, but instead at a later level, you will
need to put one practice point into it.  

Also, if you're interested in learning a trade, such as tailoring, you
might want to put some practice points into it so your failure rate
won't be as high when you start doing it.
