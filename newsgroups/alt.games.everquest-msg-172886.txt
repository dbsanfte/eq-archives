Hey there..I have sound in the game, but no spell casting sounds...I have
upgraded my sound card, I downloaded Direct X9..nothing works..I went into
my options,everything looks good...anyone have any ideas...WinXP, sound
blaster 128, and I have scars of velious, and ruins of kunark...The game
seems so quit..unless I'm attacking there is no noise for the most part..

Stormi
