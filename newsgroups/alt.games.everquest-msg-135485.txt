As one who has spent a very significant number of his 184+ days of
played time on his main as a merchant I can tell you that it will
affect it and it may go both ways.

On one hand it will have a good chance of lowering prices on most
things because there is always a good chance that someone else has one
3 stalls down.

On the other hand, many who sell things cheap have done so because
they hate auctioning and just want to get rid of them.  Viola!  No
more auctioning them, simply adventure and have a ball.  When you go
to bed at night or must go to work to make money to pay your EQ bill,
park yourself as a vendor and make money as you sleep.  This would
entice many to set higher prices than they would if they were looking
to get rid of stuff quick.
