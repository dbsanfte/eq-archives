}Actually, when this discussion started, I specifically mentioned the
}2-5 age group. And all my discussions since then had been regarding
}the 2yr old age group.

Yes, they have.  And it's been very amusing watching you thrash about 
trying to insist that two-year-olds should be consideed part ofthe 
intended audience, wen your -own- research has revealed that they are not.

}It is extremely telling that the same argument ya'all used with the 5
}yr old group, you wanted to apply to the 2 yr old group.

Same question, pretty much the same answer.  If my answer, to the child, 
begs another question, because they are ready for more, -then- you wil see 
a different, more complete answer.  Break it into bite-size chunks.

}And that is why I say your argument is a fallacy..

That in no way follows logically.

}However, that being said... It is true that, according to research,
}Sesame Street DOES gear it's programming towards the 3-7 year old age
}group.  
}I still think that 3 or 4 is too young to introduce such a complex
}topic as AIDs and HIV.

I think you think there are parts of it that are too complex to introduce.
I don't think anyone else involved with this, Sesame Street included, is 
going to introduce those parts.

What's unfathomable is your insistence that there is -no- part of it that 
even a very young child can understand.  You have no confidence in your 
children, even?

}This comes from Sesame Street's own web site.
}"Sesame Workshop and Sesame Street were created as an "experiment" in
}1968, and the show debuted on November 10, 1969. The series was
}designed to use the medium of television to reach and teach
}preschoolers, and give them skills that would provide a successful
}transition from home to school. The show gave children a head start
}and provided them with enough confidence to begin learning the
}alphabet, numbers, and pro-social skills. "
}
}Now, how and when did Sesame Street become a medium to teach Political
}Correctness to our young kids???  How did SS go from "learning the
}alphabet and numbers" to teaching about HIV and AIDs??

Did you somehow miss that 'and pro-social skills' at the end of what you 
quoted?  It's interesting that you would label all attempts to teach 
pro-social skills as Political Correctness.
