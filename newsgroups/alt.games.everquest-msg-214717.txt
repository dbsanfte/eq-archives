Not sure what it "means".  But if true, then taken with Faned's
comment elsewhere in the thread about being unable to remove a
particular curse except with Greater Remove Curse, it suggests
that there's some funny business going on with the "counters".
Perhaps the various cures have no effect if they take down less
than X% of the counter value, or some such.  That's speculation
though, would have to test it to determine if true.
