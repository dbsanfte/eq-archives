Aye, I have much the same problem with a monk the same level as you.
The problem is that many people seem to have this aim to cram as much
xp into their characters as possible, and they deem the best way to do
this is to solo non-stop.  They tool up with Temp, then get Healing,
Haste, Clarity and Skinspike potions and slaughter away.  The new
downtime regen really helps too, as getting 4% hp/mana regen per tick
means you are back on your feet very swiftly.

Then, when they hit 45-ish, and start finding it that bit tougher to
solo, they wonder why no-one groups with them any more.
