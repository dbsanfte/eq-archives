Bizybody, just because you can't see past your ample ass doesn't mean
everyone has the same problem. If you'd like to trade insults I will gladly
oblige you. Now you illiterate dweeb, there were a few refenences made to
petitioning the person in L Guk over their camping 3 spawn camps, weather
you care to believe it or not that IS evoking PnP. And if/when a GM/Guide
shows up to answer your petitions he/she will first try to have all parties
involved come up with a solution and failing that they will enforce their
own solution .
Now you halfwitted little child, I would suggest you get the pole out of
your ass and maybe actually THINK on what was said.
