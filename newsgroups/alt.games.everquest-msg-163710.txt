Simple - in a manner which is more inline with what the typical player
may expect. That is, if you can't get any better making an item, then
you should be successful much more than 50% of the time making it.

These questions are purely regarding the length of time it should take
to learn to make something. It doesn't matter to me if you can get to
that point in two minutes, two days or two weeks, so long as once you
do, you are proficient enough to make it somewhat reliably. Otherwise,
it's just a cheesy time sink severely lacking in terms of role-playing
value.
