Working just fine. In fact, for "somethings popped" type messages
we even have a mailing list to "push" to people. But, whatever. 

People use these tools cause they're too stupid to use the alternatives,
yup yup, that must be it. Really. Its the only explanation.

In fact I'm not sure why I even bother replying to this sort of
meaningless content free message.... no, no, dont tell me, you're
not sure why I do either.
