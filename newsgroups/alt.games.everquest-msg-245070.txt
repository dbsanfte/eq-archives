It seems to be a serverwide issue. There are threads (opened by admins) on
EQLive that ask for dbg.txt files if they experience PoK crashes. I also
experience PoK crashes, I cannot stay in PoK for longer then about 5
minutes.

I have a P4, 2.53 Ghz with 768 Megs of ram. When the PoK crashes my machine,
I am able to alt-ctrl-del out of it, and kill eqgame.exe with the
taskmanager. The mouse does not respond at all but I know how to work the
taskmanager with keyboard commands.

The problems regarding PoK only started happening after the April 21st patch
with me.
