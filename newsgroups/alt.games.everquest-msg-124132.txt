You were most of the way there at the king's room.  You stay to the left
side of that room and go out the door......then go around the wall to the
right........down that tunnel to some big bats,sometimes the Cavebat Lord is
standing on the hill, avoid him if you can...behind that hill is an opening,
go thru that........turn right and go thru the tunnel to right....if you see
a giant Bear named Mighty bear paw you turned the wrong way...if you keep
running from the king's room you can make it to the zone, just don't stop
when they smack on you, I ran thru the warrens many times with my ranger, I
could do it in my sleep.  Stonebrunt is a fun zone...umm make sure you have
optional zones checked in your patcher, stonebrunt is one of the optionals.
I usually was bound in the pool room if I was lucky or I'd have to run from
Erudin soulbinder thru the warrens naked to retrieve corpses...so it's not
that hard to get thru there.  Gonna take my baby druid there as soon as I
find the last durn heart for the initiate of tunare quest.
