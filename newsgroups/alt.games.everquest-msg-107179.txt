    The letters are connections. Look, for example, for the large section of
map with the letter "I" on it. When you get to "I", you go to the small
inset area and are at the point marked "I" on there. Go down through the
three rooms, and you get to "H" - and come out at the "H" on the large
section of map. It's there to show folks how stuff connects up, because
Velk's is very 3D - lots of passages on top of one another - and a standard
top-down map would get confusing fast.

    This is actually the best map I've seen of VLab yet. Thank you for
bringing it to my attention!
