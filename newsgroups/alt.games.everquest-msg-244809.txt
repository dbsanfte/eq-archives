When you are just establishing a guild, especially one with lower to
mid levels, you're going to have some people that become impatient
with guild progress and look at options where they can raid and do
what they want to do.  Some may have friends in another guild yet feel
obligated to the guild they are in.  Some may move alts around to see
what else is out there for them for whatever reason.   I wouldn't take
it personally but I would definitely have a guild meeting with the
officers and find out if they are committed to growing the guild.  You
can't do it all on your own and most people just want the officer
title and not the commitment.  Those are the ones you need to weed
out.
