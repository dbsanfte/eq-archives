This is one of nice things about having this resouce available online (even
if inconvienent at times), if errors are found, they can be corrected and

www.eqatlas.com !!

I got me a DSL/Router thing so I can share my 1 DSL connection among my
other PC's, so now I have maps on-demand, as well as chat, internet, etc.
