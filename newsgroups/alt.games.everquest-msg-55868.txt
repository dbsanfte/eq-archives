Canceling your move
Our Movelog does not have a "/movelog no" function for canceling your
decision to move. That is something we'll look into in the future. In
the meantime for the move to Antonius Bayle we will be allowing people
to 'cancel' their movelog to the Antonius Bayle server IF you send an
email to here or send an email directly to eqmail@soe.sony.com with a
subject line Cancel Movelog BEFORE Wednesday at 1 pm (pst) ï¿½ which
21:00:00 Wed Nov 07 2001 in GMT, I think. As long as the email arrives
before 1 pm our time we won't move your character. You must provide
your station name and the name of the server that you moved from and
to (no, don't send us your password). Please also clearly state that
you would like to cancel your move to the server and make certain that
the subject of your email is Cancel Movelog.
