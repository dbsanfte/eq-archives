Sounds like you might be looking at trying to set up a similar gang...er,
"business" as that group who is currently suing Mythic for the right to farm
items to sell them for RL cash.

Difficulty with these gangs...er..."businesses," is that they encourage
groups of people to hog certain camp spots for their drops.  People in-game
on certain servers might eventually have to fork out real money to get a
certain needed quest item, or go without it, 'cause some organized gang of
cash raking goons are always there.

It has the potential of developing  into a mafia style system, where if I
want the goods, I have to go to a contraband source to get it...if I don't
fork out the cash (US Dollars, not plat), I can't get the item.

By rights, I shouldn't have to pay cash to someone outside of Verant to gain
access to any item.  I pay Verant for the right to play, and I shouldn't
have to pay anyone else to get access to an in-game item.

That is the wrongness of the organized selling of in-game stuff for RL cash.
