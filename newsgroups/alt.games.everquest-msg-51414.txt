I think it's a matter of choosing whether or not the helm owner WANTS
his helmet to be seen. And after seeing the wood elf stormtrooper mask
and hearing about the dark elf bullet helm, I suspect my gnome is my
only character that might consider helmet graphics. (Unless, of
course, I make my halfling uber and get her a helm, but not counting
on that)
