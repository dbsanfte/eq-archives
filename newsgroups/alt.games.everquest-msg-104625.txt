I do, as it happens. Only alt I really have. Well, apart from
my super-twinked rogue, but level 11 doesnt count ;)

And why doesnt everyone? Last time I looked near as dammit everyone
*did*. Druids all over the freaking place.

Nothing at all; but just dont expect everyone to agree with you ;) I
would agree druids need rebalancing *in line with all other casters*
to be more useful on high end long duration uber-mobs, but I dont
agree that they're "useless" or ludicrously behind the pack in utility.

There may be a perception of that, but I think thats largely brought about
by two things:

1) Druids constantly claiming they suck, and 
2) Many druids (possibly the ones in 1) having no idea how useful they are
   because they soloed for 60 levels and are clueless about group and raid
   dynamics.
