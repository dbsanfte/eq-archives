Hunting in EK for a change of pace yesterday and I'm up towards the
hilly/mountainous area at the gorge leading to HP.  I see this one larger
mountain - well maybe not a mountain but it's a LONG way up - and decide to
run up and get a view of the zone as the sun is setting.  As I'm nearing the
top of this huge hill, I start seeing some players sitting about med'n -
some names I'd been seeing for awhile toying about with each other in /ooc
alot like raiding parties seem to do when suiting up in zones waiting to go.

Anyway, I get to the top of this hill and there are quite a few /con red
PC's to my 25 druid (everyone is con red to me I think) and a group or 2
running about in wolf form.  Of course I'm in wolf form too so I have to
sniff about and investigate as do the other doggies heh.   I figure what the
heck and hide/ctrl-b to make up some mana.  Cool place to hang out!

Then all hell breaks loose.  Something named 'Dark Elf Corruptor' appears
shouting something about everyone dying - RIGHT next to me, oh with a couple
of really tough looking 'Dark Elf Reaver's backing him up.  I've never seen
so many colors on my screen from spell effects - stuff was flying
everywhere.  The DEC went down first and the reavers were rooted off to the
side, patiently waiting their turn.

After the mop up, the crowd is congratulating one another and I'm sitting
there just blown away, and can only manage "whoa, what just happened here?'.
No one answered so I thought I'd ask here because heck, if that mountain top
belongs to that DEC and whatnot, I'll just avoid it thank you very much.
