I'm a SCAdian. Nothing wrong with that. =) Of course your guild may be 
upset with you for being gone for all Sat. raids. ;) That cranberry 
stuff sounded tasty.

I'm firmly in the no boil camp. You may want to try boiling the water, 
turning off the heat, and then adding the honey to dissolve it. Honey's 
aroma and flavor is damaged by boiling it (IMO). If you can't tell a 
difference, do it whatever way you like best. 1.5 lbs of honey is very 
light for one gallon, but if that's the way you like it, Prost! I aim 
for 3, but have done up to 5 lbs per gallon. I do cringe at Fleishman's- 
I use a wine yeast- either champagne, flor sherry, or cotes des blancs. 
But with a lighter amount of honey, you can try your favorite ale yeast. 
It's amazing the difference the flavor of yeast can make. As always- you 
are making it for *you* so do it as you like.

As far as carbs go, drier = fewer carbs. I was on Atkins for a while. 
Dry wine fits in ok, if you limit your intake to one or two glasses a 
day. Honey ferments about 97% clean, so it's less carby than grape which 
goes 95% clean. (And malt goes 60% which is why it's so carby- all the 
left over sugars that aren't digested by yeast.)
