Wizard translocates Cleric to North Karana.  Cleric uses manastone and
complete heal to get all mana back.  Cleric gates back to fight.
Cumbersome, yes...but still *way* faster than medding back to full,
even with the best mana regen items and spells in the game.

Even restricted to the old world, a manastone is one of the most
powerful items in the game.
