Bad news is that ship captains before a burial at sea before zoning out 
of the ocean so your corpse is at the bottom next to the zone line.  You 
can either take the ship and jump off near the zone line and swim for it 
or try petitioning if you can't get help for that CR because as a lvl 17 
pally I dunno if you'll have the swim skill to get to corpse without 
drowning.  If they haven't changed it CS staff used to help with this.
