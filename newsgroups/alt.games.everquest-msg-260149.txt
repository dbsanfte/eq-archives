    In Conquest's case, the accusation was that they were fighting someplace
that pathing did not allow the Warder to access. The Ixt here gets the
command "run towards the Champion" when the Champion hits 20% health. If you
can intercept him, he never gets aggro on the raid. This is different from
another encounter in Qvic, the animal herder, where the adds all get linked
aggro (all mobs are aggro on one, and only one, person) when one add hits a
certain health percentage. SOE has the capability to ensure that the Ixt
gets aggro on the raid, but for whatever reason has not done so. My guild
has never used this tactic to split them up, but I don't see a problem with
it from the "exploit" point of view.
