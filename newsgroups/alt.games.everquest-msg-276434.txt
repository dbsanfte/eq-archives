Sadly they have now added a fair number of Gnolls wandering in the
vicinity, and they spawn all over the place where most people used to
sit and pull from.  You have to be very careful in there now, compared
to how it was in the days when you just settled comfortably in front
of a spire.

There's a couple of named Gnolls that con lt blue to my 54 Beastlord,
as I noticed while heading through.
