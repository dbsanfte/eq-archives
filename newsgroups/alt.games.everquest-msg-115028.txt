Hunh? Missed the first post I guess. There will be a limited
number of jedi or rather people using the force at all?

I could see this pissing people off, but after reading the faq
about how you can choose to be a "healing type" character I think I
will go that route. With everyone and his brother probably wanting to
be a "jedi" force/combat type my guess is that a healing type char
will be desired for optimal grouping.
