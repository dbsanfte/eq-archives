    You're the second person to note this, so my post must have been
misleading. My server is Quellious, and has no list (and thus constant
contention). Bergh's server is Morel Thule, and they have 70 clerics waiting
and no contention. My apologies again if I wasn't clear.

    The sad thing is, so do the clerics that still need their clicker. :-/ I
*think* that if the backlog of clerics was cleared that the current rate of
epics entering the world (2 to 3 per week, Ragefire being the bottleneck)
would be sufficient to meet the demand. But until the backlog is cleared,
it'll stay an ugly EQ experience.
