Before I quit the game I had several successful spawns of the AC in S Ro.
It took two game days one time when I did not have a tracker but everytime I
had a tracker I got it to spawn.  The strategy I used was to kill every
undead mob and desert madman mob in the zone.  If you have a tracker then
there will be a time in the evening when there is NO undead left on track.
Then shortly after there will be either an undead spawn, Sand Giant or AC.
Kill the undead or Sand Giant spawns quickly during this time.  I have seen
the AC spawn anytime between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m. game time.  Sometimes the AC
spawned north of the DE camp and other times South of DE camp.  Also, while
killing off EVERY undead in zone kill any and all Sand Giants that spawn.
