L58 ranger alt in the guild yesterday commented how his 4 melee stats
were 255. I'm currently 290+stam fully buffed, but of course, the last
~35 stam don't do a thing. Warrior AC is comparable to other classes,
and higher damage output from others will only make taunting more
difficult. I don't begrudge these classes improvements in the slightest,
paladin and SKs certainly deserve them. Rangers probably will take the
'most popular alt' crown from rogues with these changes.

As for warriors, what I'd like to see:

1: Rumoured SoL 'extra taunt' buff, in and working 

2: Autoriposte working against flurries

3: Fortitude working against spells

4: Taunt capped higher, without making agro management trivial, but
making it possible when slowed. Maybe a slow recycling taunt disc on a
seperate timer from usual discs, or a 'critical taunt' random huge
taunt.

5: Something to help soloing in the 50s. Traditional solo capable
classes are getting group friendly enhancements, so why not group
dependant classes getting soloing enhancements. Maybe something like a
hp equivalent of meditate, or a forage-recycle-time skill where you heal
hps at the start, but are slowed/rooted/blinded/stunned/whatever until
it refreshes

As an aside, I'd love to see more high end latent haste on other than
back or belt (Dragon gloves, Cowl, and I think a CoV faction bracer are
all I know of) but that's just a personal bug-bear hehe
