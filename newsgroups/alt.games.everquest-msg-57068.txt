OMG pure evil. Genious. Did you Pally get found out? if anyone of the dwarf
guild reads this he is probably done for with them.. lol
i was at a wedding once on one of the zeks and a opposing team attacked the
wedding, figure surprise time. we were not drunk nor naked. and we kicked
there asses good.  the gm just laughed at it. we asked her if she could wait
for 10 min to rez everyone back to the wedding (like all 6 of them, we
killed about 20 of them) she did, wedding went on,
Right on top of the opposing teams corpses =)
