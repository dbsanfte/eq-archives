Greetings,

256M of RAM is not really enough for SoL - yes, get 512 total (note
windows98 does not handle >512 well)

Virtual Memory (VM) is something else - when RAM (fast) is low, Windows uses
hard drive space (slow) to look like memory - i.e. "virtual" memory.

Here is how to check your VM settings:

My computer (right click) -> properties -> Performance -> Virtual memory

Windows usually handles VM - but make sure that VM is using a drive which
has LOTS of free space - i.e. a Gigabyte or so...

Or, you can set VM yourself - in that case I suggest setting it to:
* your Fastest, largest drive.
* fixed amount - min & max at 512M or maybe 1024M (i.e. the same or double
as your RAM amount)

The message probably means your VM hard drive is LOW on space.

(Note also, EQ uses lots of hard drive space if you enable SoL Texture
cache.)
