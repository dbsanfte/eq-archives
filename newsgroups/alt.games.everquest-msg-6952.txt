Today after the servers came up, I logged in as quickly as I could and
high-tailed it to QH from NK, in hopes of being the first to get to
Pyzjn.  When I got there there was a druid who left soon after I got
there, and a mage sitting in front of the ruins.  Instead of taking
his camp spot I ran around the SFG area, looking for the elusive
Pyzjn.  Sure enough, right after midnight I saw her walking towards
the ruins up the hill that is between the ruins and SFG.  I killed her
pretty easily, and lo and behold!  She dropped the GBS.  I couldn't
believe it...not only did I kill her after only 10 minutes, but she
dropped the stone, which drops 1 out of 10 times I heard.  Talk about
luck!

So, now I am trying to sell the thing, since it's of no use to me.  I
went to EC and GFay and auctioned it, but most people tried to trade
me for it.  I don't know much about the price values of items except
for those ones I try to afford in my price range (i.e. less than
100pp, I'm pretty poor), so I am only selling it for plat.  I've heard
it go for up to 20kpp, but if I can't find a buyer at that price I'll
sell it for around 15kpp.

What's the best way to sell it?  It would seem to me that very few
people hanging around EC or GFay would have that kind of money, so
should I go to a zone with a higher number of high levels?
