Hello all, how does a level 10 Ranger with no magic weapon beat a
will-o-wisp?
I need a Lightstone to complete my armor quest.
I have managed to get the Trueshot Chainmail Boots and Gauntlets which give
me
a little extra oomph, but still, these guys hit hard and often. Kicking and
punching one
of them to death takes almost 5 mins, all my mana and leaves me with 20%
health.
Better yet, would someone have any advice for a newbie as to how I can get
my
weapon enchanted or "magiced"? What class is able to do this? What is a
polite way
of asking someone to enchant a weapon? What is a good magic weapon for a
ranger,
one that I have to work for, not just buy? Thanks to anyone who can
enlighten me.
On a side note, I swear that I will never die in the Crushbone Throneroom
again,
then go linkdead, then have to get my corpse back ungrouped.
