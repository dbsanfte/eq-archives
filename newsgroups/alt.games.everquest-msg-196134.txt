I think some of the female models are attractive.  Art can be sexy
too.  Not in the same sense a real woman is of course.  If that
makes me a bad person, so be it.

You get 1 point for being too mature to find any redeeming qualities
in the female models.  You can also get points for: claiming you're
married and not attracted to other women; claiming you don't like
pornography; and claiming you never masturbated as a teenager.

Go for it, kaev!  Score all 4 points!  You are ubah mature and we
have every faith you'll score all 4 points.
