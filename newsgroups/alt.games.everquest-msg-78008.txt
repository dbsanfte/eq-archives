You get 5 pts to 'train' in your skills (not stats) at your class
guild trainer.  For instance, I believe (iirc) you're a Half Elf
Ranger, so head back to Surefall Glade - first guy in the first big
building is your trainer.

All your stats are listed in your Inventory screen (assuming you've
hit F10 to change to the "full screen" view...  you can watch stat
effects easily that way.

Right-click and hold, an information window will pop up.

Run back to where the body is (yes, you may have to swim).
