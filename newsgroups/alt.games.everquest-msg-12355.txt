I came across the same problem at your level...but kunark was still new then
so not so many people were there yet.....anyways what i ended up doing was
start a new character and i played him about 6 lvls and got sick of it...so
i went back with my warrior to Sol b.....this is when the Everlist
started....you get on a list...run your errands in game and hope by the time
you are done you are called...if not...time to break out the lowbie...but
for the most part in the higher zones i play in such as Karnors Castle
(gotta get that cobalt!) it seems i get bumped up the list for being an all
out tank...one thing that helps is...get to know the zone somehow...be the
best puller...i made a name for myself in Guk and KC and other zones for
bein a great puller...find the maps and print them out...memorize the zones
and you will be put up top of the lists after a couple nights of playin with
regulars to the zone...and just think...when they move on and they see you
in the next zone...they will remeber you....take this time to make a name
foryourself.....its hard the next 10 lvls or so...but if you make it through
it will be worth it :)
