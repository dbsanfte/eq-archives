You have this backwards.  The game had its settings ramped
way past my normal settings.  I was choppy, doubtless because
as you suggest the video demands were too high.  Then I
turned off those models (no idea how they got turned on) and
most (ok not all, but others in my guild reported that the day
was choppy, possibly due to some servers in Europe being
down)

I doubt that windows XP decided that it should go in to my
EQ account and turn on the luclin model for ogre females...
not that XP isn't zany like that from time to time, but its
never shown any interest in ogre females before.

I propose that for some reason EQ itself decided it was
tired of my refusal to try all the bells and whistles of
Luclin when it was clear that I could support them all
based on my machine specs... whenever I go to Options
its always whining about how little I let it display.  "Look,"
it says, "you can use High Textures, Social Animations,
more models... do you know that those animators worked
their mouse fingers to the bone coming up with this new stuff?"
"What do you want to go on raids for anyway, turn everything
on and go sit in an unused zone like Steamfont where the game
still won't be choppy!"
