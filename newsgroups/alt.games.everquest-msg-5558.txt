To be honest I was having quite a time trying to get a handle on the 
time frames in the original post.  Yes, someone who who is an asshole 
one day and still an asshole months later, is usually someone who can 
be counted on to be an asshole ANY day.  But you must never forget 
that assholes have been put on this planet for a reason.  Without 
them, regular people would be assholes.  Just something to think 
about.
