Hah, a case of "the grass is always greener"; I made an enforcer so as 
to try out my melee specialist theory.  There's a little something to 
it, to be sure, but the melee weapons I've managed to come up with so 
far are all either inferior to my starting one, or are the wrong kind, 
or I can't even equip them due to being a little "slow".

Atrox enforcer, big and dumb as a box of rocks.  Special nano ability 
gives a dramatic increase to one hand blunt skill.  So much for the big 
two handed hammer, but we also start with a baseball bat.  Never did 
come up with a better weapon than that bat.  Only did a couple levels, 
so I didn't get close to the point where I could dual weild bats, or 
carry a shield for that matter.

Melee means having to actually get to melee range in order to pick a 
fight; the mobs in the newbie zone almost all won't do a thing till 
attacked.  This means the labor involved in killing doubles.  In the one 
area which does have mobs which attack, the rollerrats, its difficult to 
attack any other mob without a rat add, while with a ranged weapon its 
relatively simple.
