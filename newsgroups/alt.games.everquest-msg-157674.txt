You know, I was talking about that to an ex-guildie of mine, this past
weekend.  As far as we're concerned, the current bard system is perfect.
It's like the 'net back when DOS was still the enterence exam (that, and the
AT commands for modems....).

I'm convinced that nobody in SOE plays a bard, nor have they tried to any
significant extent.  For that reason, they know how to code the class, but
not how to balance it, or how to nerf it.  Either that, or Sony's resident
bard is in on the Code of Silence.  Either way, they're scared to mess with
the class too much, and that's alright with me.

Seriously, though, with the exception of drums that didn't play like a lute,
when's the last time bards have asked for anything substantial?
