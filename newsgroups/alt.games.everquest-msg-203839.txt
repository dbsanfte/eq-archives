Nah.  Competent EQ players just have fun.  They sit when they want to
and fight when they want to.  Unlike you, we are capable of setting
our own pace, choosing as we will between steady combat or alternating
furious chaos with entertaining chat or however else we wish to play
at any particular time.  You, OTOH, are The Perpetual Moron Machine.
Trapped in a timeless moment of whining you cannot learn or change any
of what you say or do, you just keep going, and going, and going, ...
