The other day I logged my ranger after a few hours of grinding.  The
next day, when I logged back in, my ranger was exactly where I left
him, in good health, and with all his stuff.  But I got a message
saying I had a corpse in Shadowhaven.  Out of curisosity I headed to
Shadowhaven, but so far I've found no corpse.  Now, each time I log in
I get the same message saying I have a corpse in shadowhaven.

Anyone else seen this?
