My favorite part is:

"Because being welcome by the customer, We have been delaying a 
long-time special offer!"

These guys should be on www.engrish.com

I'll tell you, though, I'm getting leniant in my old age; while once 
upon a time I'd be incensed at this kind of offer, now it does seem 
merely, as you put it, sad.

Of course, even sadder, the fact that they don't actually offer this 
service for EQ, yet thought advertising it on the EQ newsnet group would 
work out for them.

It doesn't even make sense, because they are offering their rates on a 
per level basis, yet over a wide variety of games.  I don't see EQ or 
Anarchy Online on their list, which are the two I'm familiar with, but 
leveling to 60 in EQ would take about 10 times as much effort as in 
AO... and since AO goes to 200 levels (sort of to 230) would also mean 
about ten times as much.  Are the games the -do- list all so similar in 
level range that a set price makes some sense?

I'm also envious, if I could figure out some way to make real world cash 
while playing a game, I'd probably do so.  Of course the rates they are 
looking for equate to something on the order of 52 cents per hour, which 
is doubtless "executive pay" in whatever third world country they are 
located in, but wouldn't keep me in DSL service, much less pay the 
mortgage.  I guess I'll have to keep making swords for a living.
