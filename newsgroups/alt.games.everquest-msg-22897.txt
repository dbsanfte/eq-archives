I am wondering because Im a cleric at 31 now on the Quellious server.
I have a set of earrings that give me +2 each for Wis.  and I have another
set that give +10 each for mana.  Which to wear?  And as I get higher in
levels will that choice change?

so to the basics is there an easy way to figure out which to use in this
instance and in others that may arise....

Your time is greatly appreciated.
