Provided that I don't want monks to do less damage than warriors, I'd 
still play monk over a warrior, here's why:
1) FD is awesome. Actually awesome is an understatement. It's 
spectacular. Even after the level 35 nerf
2) 90% of my equipment costs under 1k, alltogether. The only expensive 
items I have on me are cured tizmak shirt, fbss and wu stick. In other 
words, monks are much easier to equip and maintain
3) monks are much easier and faster to level, due to #2
4) until level 55 monks have a choice of tanking better than the warrior 
(no I don't consider taunt or damage output a tanking quality)

Yes, and I'd love to see their damage increased, though I'd still love 
my monk one way or another
