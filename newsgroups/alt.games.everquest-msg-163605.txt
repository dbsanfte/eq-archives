Oh don't worry, you'll get yours for this pet abuse later on ;)  I've
just about finished at the gnoll spires at level 34, but usually what
happens is that I'll use my pet as an extra "dot" while fear kiting
the spawns, but the damage he takes adds up after a while, so I'll
tell him to sit down and drink a sow potion before the next spawn.
Then I snare-pull, dot, run-and-dot, dot, run-and-fear, and run back
to my pet and sit down to med up again.  Fear wears off, and the mob
JUST manages to run up to my feet before dying right there for my
looting convenience.  After a couple of those, my pet is ready to go
again :)
