I don't think you'll find many (if any) shaman that actually like
playing main healer in PoP. The margin of error is just too slim if
anything goes wrong. Slow does get resisted after all, and all it
takes is one bad run of resists to loose your main tank, unless your
MT is either exteremly uber compared to what you're fighting or can FD
to shed agro when the inevitable happens and something goes wrong.
Once you hit 60 and get malo it gets better but I'll still take a
druid or cleric (prefered) to cover main heals if I have any choice. 

Rgds, Frank
