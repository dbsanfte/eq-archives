I would also suggest checking out www.computersurplusoutlet.com  got a new
system from them and I love it.

Although all systems do not come with a OS system installed you will need to
have windows emergency boot up floppies .. and a bootable CD of your
favorite Windows platform.

My system is now 1.7 gig, 576 meg ram, Savage Pro 3d, 40 gig HD, 10/100
tbase.. and more.

When I bought the system it was 497 plus tax and 89 for a 512 SDram chip.
Now the 2.0 gig is running for 497 and same for 512 chip.  As I mentioned
before you will need an Operating system and a Monitor.
