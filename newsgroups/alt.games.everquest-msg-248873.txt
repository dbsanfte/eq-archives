I have often Light of Life, Yaulp II / Divine Purpose, Ethereal Cleansing,
Pacify, Divine Aura, Stun, Holy Might, Force.

Divine Purpose lasts only 15 minutes and need to cast often.
Brell's Steadfast Aegis lasts 2.5 hours and Divine Might lasts 1 hours, so
they can be memorised when needed.
I try to use always Virtue, so no need to own buffs.
If you don't happen to have better haste than 30% then you may need to use
your own Valor of Marr.
I try to be in a group where someone casts snare and other mezzes, so there
is no need to root.
Force of Akera is same than Stun, only uses 90 mana instead of 35, but it is
first stun to over level 55 mobs.
As a 53 pally mobs over level 55 are problem, because Pacify don't work to
them. You must load Force of Akera to them.
I use usually 3 stuns, but only one hot button to them. What more do you get
with separate hot buttons?
