    Oh... _insult_ you.  Sorry, can't without 
becoming a hypocrite.  I remember the time I
told my RL friend that my untwinked Barbarian
shaman had a bit of good luck..she had sold
a HQ bear skill to a vendor for several gold!
Since at the she had about 2 plat to her name,
this was a major windfall.  
    I wondered why he just looked at me, not
congratulating me on my good fortune...
