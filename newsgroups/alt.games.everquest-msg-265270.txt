Oh it worked flawlessly.
In beta.

Once they started stuff like stress tests, it went to hell in a hand 
basket. Actually... I remember what blew the whole mess apart, it's when 
they had to regress the version on the database. That's when the whole 
'I'm walkin and everything spawns behind me' mess started in earnest.

When things are running great, takes no more than a second for anything 
that you would bother to interact with to appear in SWG in interaction 
range. Alas, the servers are aparently overloaded, and I've seen stuff 
appear behind my jogging character constantly on some days.

Every single object in SWG is it's own database item. Your blue shirt is 
different from every other blue shirt in existance. (If it came out of a 
crate, it will exist as object serial number 134ud9um14t9asdgj with 
these modifications in your personal char database) Even though you are 
wearing it under your closed, red jacket so noone can see it, it must 
still be looked up, positioned, sent to the client, for the client to 
decide not to draw it.

AC you could use teleports, they caused you to load things while 'in the 
port' (funky tunnel effect)... And you had to use the teleports to get 
into dungeons, but the surface was apparently zoneless.
AC2 ... dunno about it.
SWG did have 'server boundries' on each planet where you could, by 
looking at certain telltales (ways things behaved) tell that you had 
just hopped a server. One of the well known bugs for smugglers was 
caused by server boundries (if you start slicing an object on one side, 
finish after crossing, it bugs your slicing and you can't do it again 
until they reboot the servers). Most of the popular cities had their own 
machine (hell, I think 1/10th the game's population at one time was in 
one of the cities on Corellia... I could turn everything down on my 
machine that would do 30 fps all day long, and walk into that city and 
watch the frame rate counter stick on 1
I think the one where you could exploit 'zone boundries' was DAoC, but 
it was only certain specific spots, and only using wierd methods. Had a 
guy at work was a midgaard pet class type... dunno which I never 
actually played. I remember him describing his pulling technique where 
he would never get extras across the zone border at some spot. I could 
still be wrong.. and this was very early in DAoC's history, they may 
have fixed it.

UO is zoneless, but had some server boundry wierdness sometimes. They 
fixed that by putting server boundries in out of the way places. out in 
the water, that sort of thing.
AO did a lot of instancing, so I would assume zones.
Jumpgate:TRI (space game not on your list) had zones. You'd fly across 
big empty stretches to get to a jumpgate, or some piece of astronomical 
real estate. One test I did satisfied me the zones were 'big enough'. I 
headed directly away from the center of the zone when I jumped in, 
towards empty space, and never 'hit' anything. Did get attacked about 15 
min after I ran outta fuel though, by the marauding aliens
EQoA uses zones iirc (had friend in beta)
Earth and Beyond (I think... defunct space game by EA) had zones, 
similar to jumpgate (you warped or something between them)
I played lineage II in beta but can't for the life of me remember what 
it used. Course I played 2 whole hours.
