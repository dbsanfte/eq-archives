With Roadrunner when you turn on the computer and get an IP address from RR,
the cable modem looks at your NIC and gets its MAC address (the
almost-unique "serial number" for lack of a better word).

Some of the cable modems remember that number for a few hours after you turn
off the modem.

The trouble is, you get the same symptoms as you mention.  The first
computer has no trouble connecting.  The second cannot until you either turn
off the modem for a few hours or call RR and have them reset the MAC
address...and that's assuming you get a tech at RR that'll admit that it can
be done (good luck!).

A simple hub may not help...dunno.  I have all 3 of mine going through a
broadband (cable/DSL) router (Linksys in my case, NetGear is just as good
and a bit cheaper).  They are almost a no-brainer to install and work great.
Hopefully someone will chime in who also pays for 2 IPs and knows whether
the hub will do it.
