I seem to have come across a copy too. Don't remember where...

It was bogging on the HP 3GHz GF4 MX machine I ran it on. Just clicking 
on the menu items was tediously slow. I assume they are aiming higher 
than the they did with the really low requirements for the first EQ, but 
I was pretty surprised at how slow it was.

The art is just 'eh' I was certainly not filled with any desire to 
pre-order the game or count the days to release.

I can't decide if it is just the fact that I am so familiar with the 
first EQ's world and art or the new EQ stuff really is just not as 
exciting. I remember seeing my roommate playing EQ shortly after it came 
out and saying to myself I want to be in the world, now. There just 
isn't that burning desire with EQ2.
