Hold it there, you've swapped criteria in mid-stream.

Drake implied that Bizbee et al may flame someone "who sincerely
asks a question or for opinions".

You switched to "not a dumbass".  That's a different thing entirely.

Bizbee, especially, will often flame the crap out of sincere
but ignorant people who come here to ask honest questions,
if the intelligence level of the question is deemed by Bizbee
to be below his (sometimes unreasonably high) standards for
newbies, so Drake does have a point.

On the other hand, it has been a while since I've seen Bizbee
do that.  For a while though, he was making a career of it.
