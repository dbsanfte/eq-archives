It's a balance.  You're saying that you only want to roll on the items that
are an upgrade to you, which may be none.  You're also saying that you don't
want anyone else to roll on them (assuming they can't use them).  Equal
Oppertunity proponents neither demand the exclusive right to loot (again,
assuming only one member can use it, for simplicity's sake), nor extend that
right to others.  So far, neither side has the "selfless" advantage.

Ideally, the loot should break down evenly over time.  You'll get some loot
you can use, some you can sell (and theoretically turn into loot you can
use).  EO looting will be more consistant over time, since it's not
dependant on what drops.  NBG loot will be a bit easier, since it removes
the step of trading for what you need.  Again, neither side has an advantage
(and neither side can be called greedy).

OTOH, take a look at the situation where someone comes into a group who's
relatively poorly geared (as I tend to as a result of extensive soloing).
With a NBG system, I would get alot of the stuff that I could use, at the
expense of the other members of the group.  I consider that greedy because
they want more then their share.  Why should my group take a loss to make up
for my decision to solo?  They've got their own upgrades that they have
every right to work towards.

Dunno, I've just always had a bit of prejudice against systems that reward
need...
