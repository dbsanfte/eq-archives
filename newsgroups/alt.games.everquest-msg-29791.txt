Cougars are cake. Hunt on Gnome Island or, if too crowded, ToFS Island
staying away from the gaurdians.

You can single pull cougars almost every time since you are non-KOS
and have harmony.

Since you are non-KOS you can bind at the gnome camp!

Here's how to do it:

Before 35

Solo: pull to the dock side of the island with snare. (Not to the dock
unless you like to piss people off.) Dot and fear. Sit and med. The
cougars swim out into the water and won't cause any adds. Repeat as
needed, just don't let them die out in the water. Finish them off with
a nuke or damage shield/flame lick when they come to shore low on
health. (Don't try this on Midnight--she swimms too fast!)

Group: if you pull to not quite the start of the downhill slope on the
dock side, you can pretty safely cast fear assuming they are snared.
Cougars hit fast so damage shields work well. Flame lick is always a
good spell if you have tanks in the group.

35 until they start to go green

Quad-kiting cougars is great xp. You basically want to regen and ds
yourself and then pull with ensare. I just stand there and let the
first couple hit me until I have three together (for some reason the
4th won't join the other 3 if engaged in melee). Round up a forth and
pull them to the ToFs side of the island. You can run back and forth
without getting in anyone's way unless someone is already kiting
there.

If you ave crap for range slot item, you might want to pick up a
Frosted Gem -5 str +3 int +30 mana.

1. Go to dragon bridge and zone into EW (you will need to be invis to
make it safely.)
2. Follow the bridge to the bottom watching out for snow griffins.
They are faster than wolf form and kos.
3. Now find a snow dervish on track. The spawns you want are a couple
that will be not too far west of the base of the bridge, slightly
north.
4. Common drop seems to be chill dagger, frosted mantle, frosted gem,
or nothing.  Should only have to kill a few to get any of those items.
(Note: those items seem to be a rare drop in Iceclad, but a common
drop in EW. I heard the same thing about Cougar Claw Earrings, but
can't verify that first hand.)
