Once Agi > 75 don't *worry* about it
If you are a melee class then dont worry about int and wis
Also if you are melee how much do you really spend at merchants, thus
don't worry about cha.
The effect of strength to damage is so tiny don't worry about it, just
so long as you can carry your AC, oops I mean armour.
You can't even remember what dex does (not much) so don't worry about
it.

That leaves STA.

So what's your point ?
