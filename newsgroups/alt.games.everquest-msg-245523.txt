You and DT both seem to think that the latest movies flopped.  You should
check the box office figures.  All 5 of the movies are in the top 20
grossing movies of all time.  Phantom Menace is at #4.  That's just
domestic, I can't find a good list of worldwide numbers off hand, though I
did see that Phantom Menace achieved it's domestic gross again in worldwide
markets (and my god, check out the worldwide numbers for Titannic).
