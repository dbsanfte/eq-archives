First time I met him was at the inn by the lake (with the two guys fishing
for the Testimony quest).  He may have been trained there, though.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
