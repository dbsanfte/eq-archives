on my server, a lvl 60 druid went in after fear was empty, waited around a
few hours, then began to solo the re-pops around the fear break-in area.
did about ten mobs like this, then left, just to say that he was able to do
it.  so a 60 druid can solo in fear... then again, there was no mobs to
begin with initially.
