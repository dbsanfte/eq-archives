I joined a group the other night where the 65 chanter had been ebayed.  Others
in the group *used* to know the guy, and said so up front so I knew what I was
getting into.  65 Newb was clueless, and would now be #5 on my ignore list
except that he often /ooc's C3 in the POK.  And so far he hasn't screwed that
up.
But I'll never group with him again and do battle
