Yes and no.  What actually happened is you "died" mid zone but are wearing
some armour/weapons with +HPs which saved you.  If you cut it really,
really close you will appear at the designated "safe point" for that zone.

All debuffs,  DoTs or buffs are stripped when either of these two things
happen.
