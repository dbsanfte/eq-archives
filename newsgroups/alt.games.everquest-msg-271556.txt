Hi All;

Cleric level 20 fluff spell; Faerie Fire

Before coming to the NG, I did a search for this spell.  I found one 
reference to where it was, the scribe in the tree, in Elder Grove.  He 
didn't have it.

Could someone please point me in the direction of where to buy this?

Thanks in advance for your time and help.

Doctorzoid
20 Cleric
