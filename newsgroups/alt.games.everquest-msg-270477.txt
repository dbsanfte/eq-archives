That's exactly my point. Whiney little purist crybabies bitching about
shit that doesn't affect them only lead to unnecessary restrictions
such as these on the game for the rest of us.

PLing annoys me, too. But, it's not worth crimping my game to stop
them. They're gonna find ways to do it. As long as they're not
exploiting bugs, leave them be. And, like I said, it's not like
stopping PLing all together will mean that you don't have to group
with people who are idiots at high levels anymore. There's always
sites such as IGE. There are always people who "inherit" accounts. And
there are always people who are just plain idiots.
