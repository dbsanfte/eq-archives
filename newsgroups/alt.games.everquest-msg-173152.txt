She's not too tough, but she procs slow, which makes aggro management
harder.  She doesn't blind like the reavers do, she's magic immune
(except lures).

We usually pulled the reaver into the 2nd house, ran through the
reavers, waited on the house to repop, then killed Neh.

Remember - she and Rak are non-KoS, so you can just leave her
until you're ready.

We did Neh with a 56 (57 maybe) ranger tank, a 56 or 57 druid,
a low 50's cleric, a 55 mage (me) a 54 ranger and a 54 wizard.

IIRC you have a 60 ranger and 54 pally?  Clerics, haste (you're
an enchanter?)  A wizard - you should be able to kill her.

She drops a mage epic item, and the Ornate Runed Shield (decent
caster item - all our usual group folks got one on a greed roll,
I traded mine for a BWS :) and a key to elevator.

That key is the key to how we did reavers without a rogue - 
I got gfluxed up top, CoH'd folks to the top of house 2.
We'd drop down to the walkway corner, clear the walk and 
the 2nd house.  Then we'd move to the 2nd house and use
either proximity aggro to pull the reaver (the ranger would
stick his nose through the wall in wolf form, aggro a goo,
then drag it close to the reaver, then call for CoH - I'd 
CoH him in, while the other ranger tagged the reaver)

From there, we'd drop to the entrance in the wall, and pull to
the little room in the corner.  Single pulling Ghiosk's reaver
was easy - splitting the ones up top required a few CoH pulls.
