I have an Enchanter who has made it to level 8. So far, I've been
enchanting silver for my own personal use. Recently someone in my
guild has been needing enchanted silver. I've just been trading out
with him (he gives me silver, I give him equal enchanted silver),
because we both need it so rarely that I usually have plenty of time
to purchase it and enchant it over time so that it really isn't a
hassle. However, other people have started asking for enchanted
silver, and it got me thinking about cost. Many have asked how much to
enchant their silver, and I've been saying "Don't worry about it." But
it's getting so that it IS something of a hassle. I figure I should
start charging for two reason. 1. It'll give me another method of
income. 2. It'll hopefully reduce the number of requests I get once
people realize they have to pay for the service, thereby reducing the
hassle to me. So, what would be a fair price for enchanting silver,
assuming they supply the silver?
