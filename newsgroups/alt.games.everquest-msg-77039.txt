Sorry, I think this is asinine.  The economic reality is that hosting a 
site like EZBoard is extremely expensive, and with the collapse of the 
Internet advertising market, only pop-ups bring any real revenue.  I use 
EZBoard daily, so I pay for my account and I donate to my guild sitefund. 
 I end up spending about $5/month on it, and it's money well spent in my 
mind.  I can't think of anything that costs me less per hour than 
EZBoard, except for maybe EQ.
