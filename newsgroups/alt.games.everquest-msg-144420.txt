You die, you show up at your bind point.

Its called ranger gate because rangers tend(ed?) to do it far far far
more often than any other class.

Rez a body and back they come.  There are circumstances where you wish
you had a COTH handy for the puller, if you don't, you can always use a cleric
to do the job, as long as the puller has a dead body in front of the cleric.
You
can also have people die, then have a rogue or monk drag their body to the
fight spot, and rez them, or group with a necro and have them summon the
body to the fight spot (long a way to move around the plane of Air, for
example))
Yet another common use is to duel someone, die, run quickly in to the bank, get

cash, to a vendor to buy some needed item, then get rez to return to the
fight.  Clumsy?  Yes it is, but there you have it.

The warriors port is deliberate. Ranger Gate is the result of a pull the
ranger couldn't handle... while other classes Gate out of such a disaster,
rangers Die out.  I've used the term "cleric FD" to describe the same
method of losing aggro on a mob.  Death has a remarkable way of
getting mobs to stop following you around.

I'm just kidding around with you, reveling in the fact that there's someone
out there so out of the loop that jokes that got old before the release
of Kunark can still be pulled on you.  Do you want a Hertz Donut?
