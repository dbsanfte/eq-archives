For those who only use their room for vending and don't care about the
freebie furniture you got, do the following:

When you get locked out, relinquish the room and then re-purchase.  Purchase
is free, after all, and relinquishing loses you whatever's inside, but you
can replace your market board for less than a silver.

Or, don't wait until you get locked out.  Just pick up what you want to
keep, walk out, relinquish, re-purchase, and walk back in.
