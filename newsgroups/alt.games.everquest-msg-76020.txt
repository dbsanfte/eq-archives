I didn't get to go after all last night, I was babysitting my sister in law
as she played her druid. Sounds like I should be glad that I didn't go,
then, from all the negative posts. Not sure why my ex did so well there. He
was about my level when he took his druid there and I think he said he got
to 20 or so before he left. I'm sure he died... I think I remember him
telling me that a couple of Tidal Lords got him. Ah well... maybe the
karanas to kite gorge hounds and dark stalkers.

thanks for the replies all!
