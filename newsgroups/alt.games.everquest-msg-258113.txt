No.

Some merging lanes -merge two lanes- and some merging lanes merge into a 
dominant lane. Freeway entrance ramps are typically the latter type. 
Around here the latter type is by far the more prevalent type.

It sounds like your talking about true merging lanes. (e.g. which occur 
after toll booths for example), frankly, I've never had much trouble 
merging in these sorts of lanes because they do in fact -merge- and its 
much harder for asshats to block your merge... because they'll drive 
right into your right of way. On the latter type of merge, its much 
easier to block merges because they have legal right of way at all 
times.

Only when two lanes are actually merging. (And even then fault is nearly 
always usually split. After all, if you refuse to let someone in and she 
drives right into you as a result, you can hardly credit her with 
driving safely, properly, and defensively.

I do agree that actions against being an ass in merging traffic ought to 
be more enforced than it is, because it causes far more accidents than 
running a red light at 3am after stopping and looking both ways.
