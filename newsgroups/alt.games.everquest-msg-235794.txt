Never could understand why people act that way. everyone pays the same
amount (per account, anyway) to play (unless of course you're a guide, then
you pay nothing but time)

at any rate. all im trying to say is people have as much right to play the
game the way they want to as you do, you pay to play, so do we, deal with
it.

Also, as if I was on topic to start with, im drifting further from it now..
Its been my experience that people dont berate pl'ers until they ask to be
pl'd themselves and are rejected. THEN it is a crime.


Back in the day, I actually let someone into my group to be pl'd, after a
few minutes he wanted me to kick my friends char out that I was 3boxing so
that he could get more xp. well, someone got kicked alright but it wasnt my
3box. ever since then ive drawn the line at completely ignoring all
non-guild requests/tells when im pl'ing something.


Thanks for reading my rant! I feel better now. you may proceed to flame me.
