I'm far more intimately familiar than you are with it, actually you rank a
zero on this scale.

Given such, please continue to go on and demonstrate how well you can speak
through your hat.

well try it out, maybe you'll like it.  At least that way you might be able
to provide an input which is somewhat informative rather than one which is
either, in the case of Blizz, based on something you know nothing about, or
in the case of pussy being used as a synonym for coward, based on a
"bleeding heart the world is out to get me" attitude.

I know I didn't have to.  But I'm a caring type of person who after
realising that the blindingly obvious hadn't managed to work its way through
your thick skull decided to take it upon themself to point it out to you.
Alas, to no prevail.

ok your line would have gone really well as a one line retort in sometihng
like "Cheers" where the retort shows just how stupid the person making it
(that is you FYI) really is.

you provided the information, I simply got too close to the mark, tough
break for you.

yep ...

Look you've gotten to the boring stage.

You talk about things you clearly have no experience of.  You base your
ideas on falacies and either do so for the sake of being argumentative or to
sate your own feelings of having the rest of the world against you, both
very poor reasons.

I've shown that "pussy" as "coward" has nothing sexist about it - go on
imagining that it does if it makes you feel better in some perverted way.

If you're interested in WoW or even Blizz, then make the trip to agw and I'm
sure you'll get some good answers to any of your questions.  Come without
the "all men are bastards" and I'll happily contribute what I can myself to
those answers.
