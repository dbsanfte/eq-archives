	Do you have splurt yet?  Or any of the faster LDON DOTs?

	The things you complain about mostly go away later.  You get
faster dots, mana free FD, and can take hits better.  Personally, I
send the pet as soon as the mob's in camp, wait till 90%, then pile on
the dots till I get summoned at which point I FD.  Wait till the things
under 50, get back up, and twitch the cleric :-)

	Aren't the poison dots, venom etc. fast enough so that they're
resonably useful even if cast when the mob's at 60-70%?
