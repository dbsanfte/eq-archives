Far from foolproof unfortunately.  Some factioned mobs produce no faction 
hits at all, some produce multiple faction hits, leaving you to guess 
which one is the correct one.  Would not surprise me to find out that 
some produce faction hits, but not on their own faction, but I don't know 
of any off hand.
