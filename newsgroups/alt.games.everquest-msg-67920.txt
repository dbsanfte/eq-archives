Sad part for some guy is, I saw him in the Bazaar zone /ooc'ing he'd like to
trade for one of these.  I saw him there off and on for about three hours.
He cautioned that he is low level and can't offer much.  I only went to the
stable boy to see what my char would pay for those horses (way, way too much
for the near future).  When I scrolled down, I saw the very sword.  I almost
sent him a tell about it, but curiosity got the upper hand and I checked its
stats.  And that was that.  Better luck next time to him, I suppose.  But I
do wonder what this should really be worth.  For my level 17 warrior, it's a
lot better than a YAK, since the YAK's proc won't work forever for him
anyway.  I'd probably have paid a few hundred for it.  But 10K?  I don't
doubt there are some who would pay it, but that sort of price won't hold up
long, I'm sure.
