Been there, done that.

I was doing some trading with one of my sales mules when I
noticed my chat channels were broken (known bug, no known ETA
on fix).  I knew that zoning would fix it, so I ran over and
zoned into Shadowhaven for a moment, intending to zone right
back into the Bazaar.

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
You have entered Shadow Haven

Ok, time to turn around and run back.  Um.  Did I /sit
accidentally?  Oh, crap -- 289/95.

I leaned on the "forward" arrow key for about a minute
in the hopes I was just going 0.001 mph and I could
reach the so-close-I-could-touch-it zoneline by moving
one pixel every 30 seconds, but no luck.  I was simply
STOPPED.

Tried hopping while pushing forward, that didn't work
either.

Luckily, a Druid friend was nearby, and he came and
cast his big STR buff on me.  That allowed me to *craawwwllll*
one foot to the zone line.
