    Incorrect on this part.  If they build EQ and SW to have the same
massive login server then it will be detected and you can only play one or
the other at any given time.

    'Ever tried to log your account on twice in EQ?  No worky worky.

    As for the other stuff, you are correct.  They can do what they choose.
I am stating that they will have to change their wording on their statements
and they will have to come up with new wording on how they defend the
software vs. monthly because they way that it is now, my strategy (above and
before) is still in line with their statements.  Capitalism in America is
brimming with saying things correctly or you get lawyers involved.
