I'd go

SK (ogre)
Cleric (dwarf)
Shaman (ogre)
Ranger (whaterver)
Wizard (whatever)

you are going to a server where you don't have access to twinkage, so
you need characters that are usefull from the beginning, without heavy
twinkage. That's why I'd go ogre wherever possible, the starting
sta=HP is just to nice to pass up.  I prefer the ranger/wizard combo
over rogue/druid because rangers put out nice damage and add a lot of
utility with their spells and long range tracking, over a rogue/monk
that need high level weapons to do their best damage wise. And with a
shaman you don't need the extra heals from the druid, go for max
damage in a short time with the wizard.
