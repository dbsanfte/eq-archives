Your in db? Thought not...you are wrong :p

Hardly makes us the worst guild on the server, which seems to be the
impression most people have.

Ever heard of Peace of Formosa...oh wait they got disbanded by GM's...so
they formed Family of Peace...oh wait, they got disbanded by GM's again,
so they formed Temple of Dag...oh wait...

Years ago, yes, there was quite a bit of exploiting (not just by DB).
Since, however, it has become virtually non-existant. If you think
people go on /gu, "haha i just bank killed such and such", and everyone
else goes "wd!", you *really* are mistaken.

You are right we live with an exploiting legacy, which is abused to
almost the point where anything we do is written off as "exploiting",
whereas in reality its far from the truth. And yes, I do know that for a
fact.

Sorry I just can't believe you....my wizard is unguilded and ports
around a lot, and I don't think I've ever seen a Darkenbane specifically
camping a portal. I've occasionally seen Darkenbane's AT portals, but
then I see East power, The reg's, Begotten, SoF, MiM, PB etc etc..do
that too.

Put it this way, if you are not in darkenbane, and you are sitting at a
portal, and you get attacked by a Darkenbane that walks along...thats
"portal camping" and an excuse for a big whine. Yet if you are in
Darkenbane, and port in to find 3 known fuckwits casting spells on you,
its ok and justified and obviously not portal camping.
