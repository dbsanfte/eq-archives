I didn't see a contract legality statement. Please clarify what
specifically you are agreeing to. My disputes are solely with
copyright allegations, and I haven't addressed any argument to
contract legality.

Meh...possible. Unlikely but possible. They'd have a tough time
establishing damages or even that damage had occurred. But that
doesn't mean that I don't think a contract violation hasn't occured,
selling plat for $$ is a violation of the EULA, to be sure, and the
EULA were it upheld could in theory allow Sony to pursue damages.

But, for breach of contract, I think Sony would (and does) simply act
on the path of least resistance and ban the account, a recourse
stipulated in the EULA, and one that would put the initial legal onus
and expense on the ban-ee to dispute.

I assumed the OP of that statement was refering to the EULA, which you
and I have both noted does not pertain to copyright.
