With fungal tunic and haste all the melees can solo right to 50 and
past.

My ranger soloed to 50 using that and the only downtime I ever had was
after every twenty fights or so when I finally ran out of mana from
the fears, snares, and occasional rebuffs. My meditate STILL isn't
maxed out. Up to 40 I didn't even have to bother with animals, I could
straight melee everything and just regen the lost health back in a
minute. Could still do that to some extent at 50 but the regenning was
starting to take too long and the fights were getting closer - animals
were far better by that point.

The ranger paradise for high 40s is a surprising one - emerald jungle.
Full of nice dark blue animals and controllable pulls. Always good to
expand your hunting horizons.....
