But how much damage could everyone have been doing by continuing to 
unload on the mob during that 10 to 20 seconds? Much more than the 
benefit of a successful HO would be worth, it would seem.

Maybe, but apply that to a general DPS or utility class, and it becomes a 
much less equitable relationship.

In that case, I'm back to the thought that they don't provide enough 
benefit to offset the interruption in DPS they require.

So there are solo HO's that aren't affected by the actions of the rest of 
the group?

By trigger symbol, I assume you mean the initial HO graphic before it 
changes to the action wheel. I guess that part would make sense.
