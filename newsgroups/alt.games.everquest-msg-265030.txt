Something doesn't ring true about this.  MMORPG's should cost more for
a variety of reasons:

1. MMORPG's need to be more "bug free" than single player games.
   That's because players wouldn't tolerate servers crashing as often
   as players would tolerate single-player games crashing.  Also, bugs
   that lead to exploits can seriously harm the enjoyment of other
   players in MMORPG's.  On the other hand, bugs that lead to exploits
   aren't as big of a deal in single-player games.

2. MMORPG's need two separate code bases: one for the server side and
   one for the client side.  In many areas of software development,
   this doubles the work involved.  Also, chances are the server side
   is running on some kind of Unix, while the client side is running
   on Windows.  This means you often need two software development
   teams that are good in their respective areas.  In a single-player
   game, you only really need one software development team that
   specializes in Windows development (with proactive apologies to Mac
   and Linux users).

3. MMORPG's require a different kind of thinking.  Not only do you
   need to convince customers to buy the game, you need to convince
   them to keep playing.  Single player games only require that you
   convince the players to buy the game once.  It seems logical that
   MMORPG's should require extra design time because of this, which
   translates into more money.

4. MMORPG's require servers, which require people and resources to
   design the server solution, acquire the resources to accomplish the
   solution, implement the solution, and maintain the solution.  This
   too costs money.

These are just a few things off the top of my head.  I'm not sure what
data you're looking at, but it seems unlikely your average single
player game could possibly cost as much to develop as your average
MMORPG.
