I use it interchangeably, and don't miss a beat if I hear either.

For what its worth I wouldn't have 'gotten' the reference to 'being 
porked' depsite being fully aware of what 'sow' can mean in another context.

Like any normal person, I live in a world of context, in EQ, sow is 
'spirit of wolf'... and Can I get a sow, or Sow Pls, or Sow wearing off, 
etc etc all refer to Sprit of Wolf....and that's all there was too it.

Since either pronunciation is perfectly legal, and the word itself is 
just an acronym there is no basis to contend that either is more 
correct... and since it was an spontaneous acronym not an invented one 
we can't even look to the inventor for his intented pronunciation.

As such I'm happy to accept either pronunciation as valid.
