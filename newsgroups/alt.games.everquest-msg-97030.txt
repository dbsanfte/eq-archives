A good rule of thumb is to treat something as "rumour" until at least a full
patch cycle after implementation on live servers.

Test server should really be renamed "Friday Drinks Idea" server seeing as
how "tested" changes invariably screw up on live servers. The one thing you
CAN bet on though is if the screwup happens to benefit the players then the
live servers will be pulled down and the issue will be addressed within
hours. If the screwup is detrimental to players then it will be "addressed
in future updates" sometime down the track....whenever.....oh well --
"maybe"....
