If you have used /loc for more than 5 minutes, have a map in front of
you, then you should immediately be able to place your eye on your
general, if not precise, location almost instantly. I learned to use a
compass and read maps at a very early age, so that may make it easier
for me. MapX, while giving a precise location, benefits me only by
clearing up the clutter on my desk. No more paper maps everywhere.....
That is also it's only benefit. It doesn't make gameplay any easier.
