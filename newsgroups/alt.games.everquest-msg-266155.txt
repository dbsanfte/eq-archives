Not sure if you would want to do this but I would say thaw the dinner out 
side of the refridgerator for oh say 48 hours or so, make sure it is close 
to the experation date too and then let the thief take it.  Then if it does 
come out that it was your dinner you can play it off like you didnt know it 
was spoiled.
