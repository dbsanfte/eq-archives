Even since the resist patch, resists don't matter too, too much.  Certainly
they're worth buffing, but it's not going to be enough to save you if thats
all you have.   Anyone level 60 or under 55 probably shouldn't bother with
the PR gear.  In either case it's not too likely to have an impact.

You cannot treat Trak as you would most big targets.  You should definitely
still have a main tank, but make sure the healers know that they will almost
certainly have to assist heal instead.   You have to cut your MT's "build up
aggro" time from 20 seconds to about 3 seconds...   His AE is that damaging,
and even if your raid is out of range of the AE, he will just Trak Touch
whoever is holding aggro and port them to the shrooms.   Poof the clerics
are all wasting time healing an out of range warrior.

It can sort of be classified as a zerg, but some mobs, like Trak and Dain,
won't work in other ways too well.  If you don't adapt to how they have to
be fought, you die.

Make sure your tank knows what to do when he does get ported to the shrooms.
Left, Right, Left, Right, keep switching directions at each turn off (or is
it Right, Left, Right, Left?)....  anyways, try to get back through the door
before you die, so you can be dragged instead of summoned.

(Last time I MT'ed Trak, he landed about a total of 3 melee swings on me
before porting me out.   I made it all the way to the bridge... then stopped
and waited for everything to catch up, so I didn't train the raid.  He was
dead before I made it to the bridge.)
