If America never fought in unjustified wars, we'd have no need of a
military.  It is easy to argue that each and every war since and including
the Revolutionary War were completely unnecessary and the same ends could
have been accomplished through other means.  You'd have lots of people
disagreeing with you about some or all of those wars, but you could still
make an argument, and you can be sure that during each of them just such an
argument was made.
