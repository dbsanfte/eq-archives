Have No Idea what the keys are but Dragon Tooth is required to be on you so
you can port to GD WL and CS. There is a Dragon Tooth for Greater Divide,
Wakening Lands, and Cobalt Scar. The Wakening Lands Tooth works for WL and
GD while the CS toothe works for CS, WL, and GD. These Theeth will stay with
you if you happen to die also.
