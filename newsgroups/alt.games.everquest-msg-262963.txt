I used to play an Ogre Warrior, until I retired him. I happen to think
that he was quite well equipped. (Not quite Vex Thal level of course,
so that means he's hopelessly out geared by raiders.) He was never
dropped from a group because of his HP/AC, but WAS relegated to the
DPS role (which warriors don't especially excel at) due to being
outclassed by just about every Knight that joined the group.

Now, as much as it pains me to say, the equipment of the MT has the
SINGLE BIGGEST IMPACT on the success of the group. (With the exception
of the Cleric lacking CHeal.) This is not really as true as it used to
be now with OoW they are starting to go back to less damage more HP on
the mobs. But when mobs could practically one-round my warrior in
places like Tipt or Vxed, and in many of the nastier places in PoP,
kill my warrior so fast that the cleric can't keep him alive, even
chain casting CHeal, there is ample reason to ask the question, and
relegate the PC to a non-tank role if the answer is unsatisfactory.

This is SoE's fault. Their game design is what really requires this
kind of thinking. However, that doesnï¿½t mean that people that take
that kind of mindset out of Vexd, Tipt, Elemental, and bring it into
LDoN or OoW aren't asshats.

I will have to say that I come a lot closer to those kind of people
than I'd like to be. I don't like to run a hard LDoN without a Tank,
Cleric, and Chanter as a pickup group. If for no other reason than we
will likely fail it or wipe several times pushing ourselves too hard
to try and do it without the proper skills available. This is not to
say I'll refuse to do a hard LDoN if the rest of the people have a
good attitude about it. If they have the attitude, that we might fail
it, and it won't be easy, but it should be fun, then they have my
support.

I've come close to beating hards (and regularly beat normals) with a
ranger on tank. Last night in fact. It took me and a cleric to keep
him alive, and the other shaman to slow while the chanter did CC, but
we came within 2 minutes of beating it, and we would have if we didn't
get a really bad pull and the cleric hadn't gotten killed in the
beginning and caused us to loose about 10 minutes on the adventure.

There are people who insist on having the "Holy Trinity" to do a
normal LDoN, or a normal EXP group in places like OoW. These people
are asshats and you really shouldn't worry about what they say.
