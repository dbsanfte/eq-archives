I am fairly new to EQ... so don't shoot me.

I have my EQ resolution set to 1024x768, but when I'm in the mode that shows 
the full interface (like all the wasted space for all the buttons and the 
little shield/sword icon in the to left), it seems to drop back to 640x480. 
When I go to "half-interface" or "full screen" modes, it seems to actually 
use 1024x768. The switch to jump from the 2nd two mentioned screen modes 
back to the "full interface" mode takes approximately 2 seconds on my 
monitor, maybe 1.5 seconds.

I could live with this, except that it does this CONSTANTLY when I "loot" 
corpses. Why can't it just autoloot the corpse stuff into whatever places it 
will fit without bringing up a stupid screen? Also why does it do this even 
if there is NO LOOT or only money loot?! 

Is there any relief here? I love the higher resolution and more visibility 
(less wasted interface), but the delay of switching video modes is too much 
to bear, so I end up playing in boring old "full interface" mode all the 
time. It sux. :P

If there's no fix now, is this planned to be addressed in an expansion?

BTW, I have only the Kunark full version. No Velious, but if this is one of 
the fixes from Velious, I am SO THERE, baby. :P
