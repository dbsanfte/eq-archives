You would be unlikely to get SoS from me, I would have to hunt for it in my
spell book, I would be casting Charisma, a much better buff.  I would also
be quite likely to just ignore a tell, if you ask in ooc, or in say nearby,
I am quite likely to cast the buff, and I would not accept any payment for
it.  If I am in the area doing shopping anyway, I will often cast Charisma
on people I notice nearby doing the same.
