Yeah, that's a good point, but having a JBB is likely to have much more of
an effect on your playing than even a full set of planes armor, especially
since there probably isn't going to be much competition anyway as a shaman.
Now that the price is down to 20-25k on many servers it's not very difficult
to get one by the low-to-mid 50s even for an untwinked character.
