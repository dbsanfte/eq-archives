Well, not quite true. You still have to zone at the river and there are
often spiders patrolling that area. Also, if you decide to cut across
country directly to the zone, there are often froglok variations around that
can see thru invis. Also, my characters have ben killed by spiders several
times when there has been no "you are starting to appear" type message,
invariably when there has been some close contact with a spider, which makes
me think that there is a possibility of  even some spiders sensing you (oh
yes, sorry, you did say "most of them can't see invis". Any ideas which ones
can?).
