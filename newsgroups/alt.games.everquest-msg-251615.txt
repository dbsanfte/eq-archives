If you are having problems with a mob and want help, use /yell.

If you are under 10 death doesn't matter, other than losing whatever buffs
you have. Which is only a problem for those that can't seem to play without
temp after handing in the newbie note. A lot of  people nowadays just fight
until dead, respawn, fight until dead, etc. It's the quickest way of getting
a full health and mana bar. I often suicide after a close fight, just
because it's quicker. The seemingly indifferent player who let you die might
have thought that this is what you were doing.

And with regard to your journal, the Kobold charm only gains full strength
once you have seen each of the people in the tutorial. Your character with a
+3 to everything just hasn't spoken to everyone, whilst the ones with +5
have. If the character isn't above 5, pop back into the tutorial and chat to
them all. If he is above 5, but under 10, I'd delete and restart him, but
that's just me. The Kobold charm is a nice item for a slot that is way under
used, IMHO.
