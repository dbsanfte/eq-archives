Ok; this is freeform meandering, not a coherent and thought out
argument, and its off the cuff - I'm looking to chat about whether
this *is* a problem and am bound to say at least a few totally
ludicrous things ;) forgive me ;)

The "problem" from a game design perspective rather than a game
*players* perspective is that your existing content becomes
uncompelling for new players without constant manpower devoted to
enhancing its rewards to remain attractive in light of the continuing
increase in availability and power to lower and lower levels; why
go hunt in guk for a yekesha when someone will sell you a much more
powerful weapon for a few hundred pp? when a lamentation goes for
4k? A wurmslayer for 1 or 2?

You need to bear in mind despite the decrease in pricing on *items*
the influx of platinum remains fairly constant for genuinely untwinked
lower levels, and increases for the server as a whole as the
poopulation levels up.

Now; there are some other issues here too. As people find, more and
more, that its just not worth their time selling stuff because
nobody wants to buy it the item market begins to lose liquidity;
people wont trade for items because they wont be able to offload
it, and so all of a sudden you've removed a large pool of potential
currency from the market, that inherent in the items values themselves,
and are reliant on a very small pool of actual pp, further depreciating
prices as you reduce the amount of cash available to people, and
further exacerbating the issue of lower level players no longer
seeing any point in engaging in the Ivy armour quests, because hey,
rygor is 200pp a piece, at most.

This in turn means folks arent doing some of the more engaging and
*very* manpower heavy content of the game; helping buddies quest
for armour, weapons, etc, as the reward isnt worth it - it reduces
the game further to kill kill kill kill med kill kill kill, and
socialising in closed groups.

I dont think this is healthy for the game; it removes some of the
motivation to get out and about and experience the world as a world,
and reemphasises min/max playstyles that focus entirely around areas
with item drops at the very high end you can actually use or sell,
or good cash/gem drops.

It also removes an element of immersiveness - when every level 15
player in highhold is equipped with rygor and ebony blades, or
equipment equivilant to that previously used only by people many
levels higher the excitement and risk of running through that damn
place is lost; it becomes just another supermarket hunting ground,
totally safe and overwhelmed by the relative power of those fighting
within it.

Final thought; it massively accelerates the pace of advancement
through the lower levels resulting in less skilled and experienced
players crowding your (capped) higher level hunting grounds faster
and faster, getting everyone cramped into the end game content at
a quicker and quicker rate, resulting in more and more dissatifcation
and competition for fewer and fewer actually valued resources
(content).
