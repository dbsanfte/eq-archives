Did you even bothered to read what he said?
The issue isn't that he's trying to take something away from DOA, it's
that by killing Vulak the way they did, it leaves open the VERY strong
possibility that Verant will upgrade those mobs.

*THAT* is his big complaint.

But you know what?  Fuck it.  I know my guild will kill Vulak and be
able to continue killing him.

However, if Verant decides to upgrade him because people tried to gimp
him, fine.  I know my guild will still be able to kill him.  Others on
the other hand, well guess I shouldn't try to take away their
acheivements...
