Speaking of Specialization .. A druid in my guild is having a bit of trouble
with hers. Something bugged out, and she has two Specializations that are
stuck in their 90's, two in their 60's, and one down at 10 or so. I
suggested that she reset her Specializations and try it that way, but
haven't heard any news of it.

Any ideas why her Specialization is bugged out?
