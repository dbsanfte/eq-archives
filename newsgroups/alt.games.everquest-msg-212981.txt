Just to give everyone a heads up.

Shared platinum slot may be bugged, at least it was for me.

I logged into one character, put some plat into the shared slot and
now I can't log into any other character on that account.

Even tried removing the plat from the slot but no joy. I have 2 accounts and
it happend on both of them.

I sent in a /bug report on both accounts and told the chat GM.

Hopefully will be fixed soon. If not I will be playing a level 9 naked troll
warrior tonight. =)
