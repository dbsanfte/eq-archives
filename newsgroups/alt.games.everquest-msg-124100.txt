You realize that that's actually a cliche, don't you? The Greeks went as far 
as to actually calculate the diameter of the Earth with notable precision, 
but I haven't heard of any civilizations for which it was dogma that the 
Earth was flat, because the fact that it isn't is actually self-evident 
(when you walk anywhere, you start seeing tall landmarks rise above the 
horizon, rather than just get bigger... This ought to be evident enough).
