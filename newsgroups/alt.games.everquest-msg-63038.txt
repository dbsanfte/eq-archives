Not anymore, the new patcher uses WININET.DLL which is in your system 
directory, but only if you have IE installed. Very annoying, my Win95b 
install doesn't have any version of IE installed on it. I took a lot of 
care to insure this. It now has a couple of IE's dll files in the system 
directory... At least it doesn't require IE to be installed. /sigh
