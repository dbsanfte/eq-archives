Yes, as I said, I'm familiar with the "multiple haste icons, only one haste
working" phenomenum from my bard alt, who frequently gets people asking him
to play haste even though they have a shaman or chanter  haste on them
already.  At 40, I don't have a haste song that stacks haste on top of spell
haste... but they've seen the icon and been told bard song stacks, so thats
what they want.

I'd wager YV -isn't- a 25% haste that stacks on top of spell haste, since the
best bard "stacks on song haste" is what, 10%?  Maybe 15%.  But I'd really
like to know for sure, so I can make better descisions as to what to ask for
in terms of buffs.

Hmm, even more interesting, assuming they don't stack... which haste takes
precedence?  Highest?  Lowest?  One cast first?  What happens when (as
happens a lot with YV) you have one of the hastes going on and off repeatedly
during the run of the fight?

Another stacking issue; I had some high level shaman and chanter buffs on me
last night in a HS group; my dex was at 215 without YV... and at 230 with.
That would flicker back and forth, so YV wasn't killing an icon, but I sure
wasn't getting full effect out of it either.  This suggests to me that the
dex portion of the spell doesn't stack with the dex portion of something
else.. anyone know what?
