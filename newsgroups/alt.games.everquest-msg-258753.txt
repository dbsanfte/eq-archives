The exceptions have to do with multiple procs and very very slow
weapons. You can only proc once on a swing even if you have three
different procs (innate, weapon, augment). Under 99.999% of
circumstances this means delay has no effect on proc rate. However you
are less likely to have two procs potentially successfully make their
roll on the same swing the lower your delay is. Since one proc is lost
if that happens, there is a tiny effect from delay. It takes a
gigantic parse to actually see any difference.

I only included the "mostly" to avoid some knowitall pointing this
out. :-p

No, I am saying you proc the same amount, but you are more likely to
get that proc on the important rampage swing if you aren't doing any
other swinging (btw just turning off attack doesn't help :-p ). If the
proc, which has made its check to see when to go off, has no choice
but to go off on the next swing because there are *no other swings* in
question due to high delay, then it will. You want the proc when you
hit rampage. That's what you're trying to do by slowing yourself in a
warrior earthshaker ae group.
