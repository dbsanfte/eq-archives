I don't think swg was a lot of competition. SWG is more UO like, by
the same very poor designer dork. 

It might be more due to people like me closing both their accounts
because they are bored of the "get friends and pack a lunch!"
direction of EQ. LDON even goes further in that direction, with pickup
groups being a lesson in patience and failure.

I'm waiting for Final Fantasy Online right now. The pc one should be
pretty well done since the PS2 one has been out for so long. You also
get the expansion pack with the PC one. From what a friend in the beta
says, you have no big downtime and can get lots of appropriate quests
right for your level and such as well as quests when you have new jobs
availible (like classes sort of, but you can always switch.)

Value in EQ just kind of continues to decay as time goes on. The game
gets more and  more outdated and expansions for the few just cement
that.
