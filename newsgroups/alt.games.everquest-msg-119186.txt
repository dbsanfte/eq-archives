Any guide above apprentice has the ability to "nuke" a mob away
through a single command. The mob poofs, leaves no corpse, and no one
gets xp off of it.

However, the planes are zones where guide presence is restricted, only
allowed when they cannot solve a problem from outside the zone. They
are to leave IMMEDIATELY after solving the problem. So, as I see it,
if it was a guide, their presence in the zone itself would have drawn
too much attention to them for them to risk something so stupid.
