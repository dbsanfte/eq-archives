If you can work out where any given mob will path on aggro you can
sometimes single pull out of a small formation of mobs, use Jolt to
pull at the maximum castable range you can as it'll give you the best
possible shot of a single.  If your targeted mob paths over or very
near another mob that'll almost certainly come too, since some recent
pathing changes mobs love to warp right onto you if their way is
blocked, this can be used to your advantage...

One more person who can pacify mobs indoors (Cleric, Enchanter, Bard,
Paladin) would make a vast difference to your chances of success to
be honest not to mention the other benefits those classes bring.
