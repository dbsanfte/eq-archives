Copied from the patch mesage:

HOTSPOTS

- the Castle of Mistmoore (20th to 30th level)
- The Lair of the Splitpaw (35th to 45th level)
- Dulak's Harbor (40th to 45th level)
- The Tower of Frozen Shadow (30th to 35th level)
- The Gulf of Gunthak (35th to 40th level)
- Hate's Fury (55th to 60th level)
- The Crypt of Nadox (50th to 55th level)
- The Torgiran Mines (45th to 50th level)

Though I couldnt notice the xp bonus in Dulak with my
42 Enchanter.Echo Caverns looks the same to me
regarding xp,and its much more convenient.
(He,I am the Pally with 0 swimming)  :)
Mobs in Dulak seem to have a lot more hps and hit
harder,so if there is a xp bonus it will be eaten up
by the fact,that you need more time to kill a mob.

Lately I found The Deep gives great xp in the low to 
mid fifties,much better than PoI or Ldons,I can actually
see the xp bar move after every kill.
Too bad its a "Bring your own group zone"
