I think alot of the trouble is *gear*.  My ranger was my first character and
had really crappy gear because she was really broke.  I think I still wore
pieces of my *made-to-order* banded armor in my 30s.  I didn't dream of
starting an alt because I couldn't afford stuff for my main!
OTOH when my beastlord was playing in the Oasis at around 16 some guy ran up
and handed her a Treeweave and some fancy boots  
Kids sure have it easier these days.
