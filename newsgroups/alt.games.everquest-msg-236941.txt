You can nuke anything to get skill ups.  He can skill on a green con;
it's the major difference between melee and magic.  The undead nukes
would have to be cast on undead.  

Befallen has lots of undead and is pretty deserted on my server so he
could blast singles until the zone was cleared of undead.  

He could also use the nukes to pull in CoM if he wants to get exp.
