http://groups.google.com, I think you will find that you can review as much
of the old posts there as you care to, probably quite a bit more than you
care to.

I use a GeForce2 MX400 with 64MB.  It works very well, I have everything
turned on, I run at 1024x768 I think, might be higher.  In Luclin city
zones, it pretty well sucks, anywhere else it works nicely.
