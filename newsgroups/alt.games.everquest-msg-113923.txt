This is strange.

I have a small LAN at home sharing a cable connection. At any one time 
we have up to 4 players playing EQ without problems.
Now my girlfriend plays at her house too using a modem, and experiences 
the same LD problems you speak of. Her ISP is an ISP I used to work for, 
so I know their network and equipment and am definite its not them. I 
tried changing the datarate to 3 to see if it helped, but it didn't. I 
was suspicious it may be her modem but after reading this I am not so 
convinced!
