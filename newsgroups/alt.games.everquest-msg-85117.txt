Many versions of Windoze muck with the virtual memory (swap file) 
intermittently for several minutes after boot for no discernable reason. 
  Waiting 10min would make sure that Windoze wasn't messing with the VM 
too heavily while you're playing.  In case you haven't noticed, neither 
Windoze nor EQ is exceptionally stable (has more to do with the variety 
of hardware platforms than any coding deficiencies, much as I'd like to 
blame it all on microsoft), minimizing the chance of both of them going 
after the same resource at the same time will reduce your risk of lockup 
and/or crash.
