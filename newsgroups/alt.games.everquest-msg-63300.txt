Forget any other drops from the king, get your piece and be thankful.

He is usually a 72 hour spawn but will go "buggy" of Naggy pops. It resets
the the spawn timer. But usually (and I mean usually) he appears after 24
hours of Naggy dying.

It is the FG's every 8 hours you have to kill. And if you let them pop and
cannot take them out at 3 AM your time, some other cleric will try to
contest your camp and try to take it from you.

Most servers either have a list, OR as soon as comeone gets their piece you
have to get a gorup in place and hold the camp, and then wait...and wait and
wait.
