SWG had more bugs than WoW on release, AO had more bugs than WoW on
release, EQ had more bugs than WoW on release, Vanguard had more bugs
than WoW on release.  None of these other games had remotely the
resource behind them that WoW did.  It's not rocket science.

Vanguard had 1 [ONE] person devoted to QA so it's hardly surprising
the enormous resources behind WoW were able to do better HOWEVER
unless you're some sort of rabid fanboy or didn't actually PLAY WoW on
release then to claim it was even remotely bug free is purely and
simply delusional.

Of course what would I know I only actually PLAYED all these games at
release, eh?  I must have imagined the showstopping loot lag, mob
warping, harvesting freeze bugs and mysterious-without-warning
disconnections every 20 minutes in the first week of WoW.  Not to
mention the "oops, seems you don't HAVE any characters on that server"
and all the other fun stuff even getting logged in.  Hell, it was more
stable the last week of Beta.

All this in a very much 2nd generation game.
