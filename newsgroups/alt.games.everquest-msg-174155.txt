Two ways of looking at it, and neither one bodes well for the Palestinians.

1)  The Palestinian attacks are not legitimate acts of war, and are thus
terrorism.  Isreal is justified in removing them from the face of the
planet.
2)  The Palestinian attacks are legitimate acts of war.  Isreal is now
engaged in a conflict against an aggressor who will use what means they have
at their disposal to harm Isreal.  If they want to end the killing, Isreal
had best get tough and remove the Palestinians from the face of the planet.
