How will they know it is addictive?  Will there be a testing board before 
the game comes out?  Will somebody have to shoot himself first?  Will it be 
valuntary, in which case it will turn into a simply marketing ploy?  I can 
see it now "Rise of the Robots 4!  The Surgeon General says this game is 
DANGEROUSLY FUN and MINDBLOWINGLY ADDICTIVE!  Our game just might be TOO 
DAMN GOOD for you to handle.  Please play with care."
