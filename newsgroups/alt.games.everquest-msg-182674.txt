OK, I have 2 PC with EQ on them. My main runs EQ just fine, no
problems there. But a while ago I tried to run EQ on my secondary just
to get all the patches that were due ( I hadn't touched EQ on that
machine in months). Well it would just kick me to the desktop after
getting to the server selection screen. So I blew it off figuring I
just needed to upgrade drivers or some crap like that. SO I finally
get all the new drivers and It still kicks me out at the same place.
So I delete EQ and just go for a reinstall . Well then , I go to load
up Old World EQ and it gets up to 98% and I get a "SEVERE" windows
error box every time ( I reloaded OG EQ 3x ). But it does look like it
installed so I try to log on with just old world, I get the patcher
and get all the new files, I hit play,blah,blah,blah and again I get
kicked out after the server select
screen.

I can't seem to figure out what's going on.

machine is a:

P3 500
Windows 2000
256 ram
Geforce 4 MX420
Sound blaster Live 5.1
running on cable modem

And yes, it did run EQ just fine before.
