As a monk, I have a few tips I have found useful.

Faster less damaging weapons generate more aggro than slower less damaging 
ones.

Procs can generate aggro, ESPECIALLY ones that stun or debuff.

I have a hotkey I call "DEAGGRO". It is:
 /pause 5, /attack off
 /pause 5, /doability # (Feign death, forgetting the actual # ATM)
 /sit off
 /attack on
The chance of the FD memblurring, plus the 1+ second I am not swinging my 
whack-'em sticks, tends to help a lot.
