No its not though... firstly if your in ST they are going to get primal
sometime anyway

Secondly, how many 60 ST key shamans in your guild are happy to keep
recasting Primal Avater?  We have 2 shamans with ST keys (about 55 keys
total) and I don't see either of them in a million years, keep re-casting
Primal avater on a raid

Agree about the stronger guild bit.. but still heh.. the games about fun,
and doing ST every 2 days as a caster sure isnt fun :p
