Being the deeply paranoid and mistrustful person that I am, I'm obviously 
very concerned about my security online.

With that in mind, does anyone have any hints or tips on how to run 
EverQuest through a firewall?  I'm currently using Norton Internet Security 
which I'm having to disable each time I play - and since I play for a 
couple of hours at a time I'm not too happy about how vulnerable that 
leaves me.

The initial stages are easy - the patcher program appears and NIS asks me 
whether I want to permit access.  It tells me that EVERQUEST.EXE is trying 
to access the net.  So I give that file complete access.  And then I get to 
the logon screen where NIS obviously pops up asking me to authorise 
something else.  The problem is that since EQ won't permit task-switching 
the message appears behind EQ and I can't see what it is or how to answer 
it.

So if anyone has any advice I'd be very grateful.
