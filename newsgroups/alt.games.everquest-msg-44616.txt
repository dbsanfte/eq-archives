This is from Casters's Realm.  You can read the whole article here:

Can you please direct me to the location of zone / dungeon experience bonuses list on the EQ website. If there isn't one, could you
please give me a listing or possibly have a listing placed in the EQ_manual in everyone's eq directory. I'm sure other players would
benefit from this information as well.
I realize that underutilized zones and dungeons receive an experience bonus to entice players to go to zones / dungeons with poor
loot, poor access for melee binding, poor pathing, etc. I'd like to hunt for experience and so would benefit from knowing which
underutilized zones / dungeons give the most experience.

Sure. Actually, the best place to find the recent increases are on the web site. Head to EverQuest.com and look under the Producer's
Letter. There's an archive at the top. Choose the Producer's Letter from January 14th, 2001.

I'll copy the relevant part here. After all, we want people using these zones, it won't hurt to remind everyone that we've recently
increased the experience gain for them.


In this case, we decided that the most appropriate action for several underutilized dungeons would be to increase the ZEM; that is,
increase the amount of experience that everyone gets when adventuring in the zone.
As of the next patch, you will receive additional experience (per kill) in the following zones:

Droga increased by 12%
Nurga increased by 12%
Solusek's Eye (SolA) increased by 13%
Najena increased by 13%
Befallen increased by 13%
Paw increased by 13%
Permafrost increased by 13%
Kaesora increased by 18%
Qeynos Catacombs increased by 20%
Runnyeye increased by 20%
Kerra Ridge increased by 20%
The Hole increased by 25%

Hope that helps.
