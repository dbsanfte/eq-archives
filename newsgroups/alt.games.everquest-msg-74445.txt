While fighting in the Sarnak fort today, I had two near TPW's in two groups.
In one, I was the last one standing.  In the second, myself and a wizard
were left.  In both cases, we had a wizard gate on us.  Could have used the
help, but we survived.  Neither wizard will ever group with me again.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
