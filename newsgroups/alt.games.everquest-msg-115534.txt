Yeah, well, I was about to get cracking on it when I found out that
only the first completion of the quest was special. So, now I am
waiting to see what the reward is changed to after patch. I don't need
the earring and if the other means of getting the scroll are to go to
a vendor or something...
(Speaking of unneeded earrings, I got a sarnak earring of station last
night. Tried to have a guildie run there and get it, but he didn't
make it in time and I looted it myself with 1 second to spare. Wearing
it would be a downgrade since it has no hp/mana, so I think I'll just
wear it when I want to make tanks cry or something *evil grin*)
