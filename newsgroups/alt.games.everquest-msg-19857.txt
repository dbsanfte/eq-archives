Given the number of things most Rangers I know would rather be doing than
tracking something down for someone they don't even know (or even like, for
that matter) I'd think the pricing scale goes more like this:

4pp per hour up to level 10
8pp per hour up to level 20
Ranger's level in pp per hour up to level 40
Ranger's level in PP every ten minutes past level 40.

Of course, if you know a Ranger who likes you, they may very well do it for
free if they aren't busy and you ask them nicely.  Especially if you offer
to pay teleport fees if they have to travel to reach you.
