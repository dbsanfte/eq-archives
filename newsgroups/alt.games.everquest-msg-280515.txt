I used WinEQ and EQPlayNice with my current machine (2.8GHz, 1GB RAM,
ATI 9700 AIW).  It worked ok for the zones I was in, never took it to
some of the more popular lag zones.

The one thing that caused me to stop doing this was zoning.  If I
zoned toonA I was unable to switch to toonB until toonA was fully
zoned, which could take a while.  I quickly learned to auto run toonA
to the zoneline and switch before he got there.  But it was a pain and
I forgot it a couple of times when in a full retreat.
