It is up to you how you want to play the game in the end and I am sure no
opinions expressed here will sway your ultimate true intentions.
Personally, I feel if you are fickle and wish to try out many different
races/chars, then by all means do it.  I personally wouldn't do it until I
at least had 1 character way up there with access to getting some mid-high
level items in order to twink.  I must commend your reluctance to twink
though and wish you even more luck due to that.  It can be rewarding if you
have the time and patience to do it, and really want to do it.  I am
incredibly fickle but also quite lazy and that pretty much restricts me to
2, if not 1 character at a time.  I am in the process of building up my
first character as well and just thinking of building another character up
again at this point seems futile and frustrating.  I attempted a Paladin and
got them up to level 8 before deleting em.  I do have plans to play other
characters eventually but it will probably never get done.  Through 2 years
in Ultima Online, I did build up 3 characters, but 2 were after power hour
was put in the game so it was not a chore at all.  I see myself sticking to
one character here even though I'd like to expand.  Right now my personal
list is:

Male Human Warrior, Level 28.
Female Halfling Rogue, Level 2.
Male Iksar Shaman, Level 1.

Perhaps if I am really really bored with my warrior someday or if I ever
reach the high level game (yeah right!), then I will work on another
character.  But quite frankly, the game is very tedious and most of my time
is spent socializing and fooling around with guildies and other players.  If
it was not for the friends I've made within my first 2 months in EQ, I
probably would quit after my initial 3-month subscription, but I am having a
blast just socializing.  You can see by the test I took, Socializing does
far outrank ACHIEVING and EXPLORING. ;)  Doing the exp. grind and starting
over with a second character does not seem appealing in the least and I have
the utmost respect for people able to do it.  But then again, I guess there
are many people who somehow enjoy the actual game.  I do, but only to a
point and it seems there is only so many times you can kill a Giant.

As far as keeping all your characters in Freeport... I'd recommend against
that.  If you are going to do this, you at least want to be spread out
throughout different locations and experience difference camps and hunting
grounds and zones.  I'd figure it would be pretty boring to have 5
characters all at once camping Dervs.  Prepare to rip out all your hair.
