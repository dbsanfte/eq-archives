I disagree, monks are one of the DPS classes, and handy for that
purpose even if they never FD once; their ability to FD if they
do get unwanted aggro, and to Mend up the damage they do take
(from getting it accidentally, or from short offtanking, or from
ripostes if the mob isn't positioned well) means the healers
don't really have to worry about them if they aren't pullers.


I just meant that the use the Prima guide suggests for them seems
to be unimportant, not that they are useless in LDoN as a general
rule.

As a non MT melee, yes.  But the melee that's the MT is all about
helping the casters, by grabbing aggro and keeping it.  If the MT
doesn't get hit consistantly thru the mission, then he's not the
MT, he's just another guy in there swinging.  If a rogue, monk,
or ranger is getting the aggro, though, then he's not really
helping the situation much; trading one easily killed target for
another, at the cost of 15% of his damage output (more if he's a
rogue)

Bah, cleric group heal isn't all that, you must be thinking
paladins.  Clicky Rez Stick won't help much either, given that
most people agree that "just loot up and move on, get rez after
the mission is over" is the best strategy under the time
pressure.

Aye, Mana regen is nice, but presumably the entire group
(probably including the warriors) already have it, thats my
point.  I already gave them CC, no use trying to get me to argue
that one.  BUt they dont' mention slowing or hasting or stunning
at all, which is another point against this description of the
utility of the class in LDoN.

Good points, good uses of the class... they are not mentioned by
the Prima Guide though.  I'm not arguing the utility of druids,
I'm arguing the Prima Guide silliness.

Again, good point, one that totally escaped the authors of the
Prima Guide though.

Yep, porting away from LDoN is a good use for wizards... and for
druids, but somehow the guide implies that only wizards can do
this.  TLing out, though, not so much, there's little need for

Umm, what?  My statement didn't say "shaman pets are lousy off
tankers" or "Shaman slows suck"  or "shaman can't heal worth
beans".  It only said "Buffs and debuffs are the only things
shaman are good for?  Are you crazy?" (lose translation, but you
quoted what I actually said).   Yes, shaman are indeed all that
and a bag of chips, in fact they may be the best class in the
game... but thats not what the Prima guide had to say about them.

Yep, again, they didn't mention rogue's as damage production at
all, unless they meant as "tanks" where they said whatever class
that was would be both primary damage dealer and caster
protection.  Rogues aren't much good at the latter...

Necros are a great class... but they left out beastlords and
mages too, and really didn't do at all a good job of covering
melee classes, mentioning only two by name.
