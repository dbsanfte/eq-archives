Just a thought but that wouldn't be overly bright of VI to block downloading
like that.

Every zone has changed in the game.  Even if you did a full install, the
patcher still has to replace almost every file so, what's the diff loading
200k to dowload vs loading the full 4 CD set to do it (base, Kunarak,
Velious, Luclin).  I HAD to do a full reinstall of the game when I got my
new machine.  Guess what, virtually the enitre thing was dowloaded anyway...

All they would do by blocking the 200k folks is postpone the dowloading from
full up front to full in a few minutes (dependant upon client bandwidth).

As for cost of bandwidth, your 200 k loader would still do what they want,
just in a few shifts.  No matter what it still costs VI the same wether they
pay now or pay later...

Nice thing about your post though -- you do point out where that $10 a month
goes and why they need to raise rates...  Bandwidth, quantity of servers,
staffing (where is Customer Service?)...  with well over 1400 machines up
and running, plus bandwidth to support some 80,000 online simultaneous
players...  that takes a bit of funding...
