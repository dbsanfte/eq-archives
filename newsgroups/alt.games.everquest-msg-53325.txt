Well, honestly, I type how I speak. If I use a word that is yet to exist (yeah,
I do that sometimes) I'll spell it phonetically or however it should
sound...thus, when I'm scanning a  line of chat,  "plz"  and "thx" come out as
unpronouncable gibberish. Of course I make exceptions for common abbreviations
of long, or harder to spell words for those who have problems (not everyone can
be an english language prodigy)..but "please" and  "thanks" really shouldn't be
 that hard. This is, of course,  just an opinion.  To each his own.
