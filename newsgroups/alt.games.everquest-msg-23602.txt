I have had this problem. Not always, when I do crash
(blue screen), it is almost always just as it starts
raining. Turning off the particle effects has helped
some, but it really comes down to having a video card
that is unable to handle the game. My solution has been
to get a new computer, which was shipped today and should
arrive some time next week.
