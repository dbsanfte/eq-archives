One could argue that that's one of the benefits of playing EQ in the first
place.  The fact that it could (pre-latest-patch) be run on a wider variety
of systems than any other game of it's type, thereby increasing the
potential player-base.  You'd be amazed at how many people out there haven't
botherered getting anything faster than a P166.  The beauty of EQ was that
it could be run equally well on a P166 as on a P3-800, or faster.  By
manditorily uping the requirements, they're potentially alienating a rather
large userbase, and all the revenue they'd otherwise get from that userbase.
It would have been better to make it a two-tier system or some sort, which
would allow people with lower-end systems to keep on playing, while allowing
people with higher-end systems to play on the same servers, with the option
of downloading a graphics upgrade package (new textures, better sounds, new
models) that requires DX8.1 or higher, and a better system to run.  All this
could be handled serverside, although it would take an update on par with
the one they've been doing for Luclin.

So....  Alienating loyal players with lower-end systems = bad thing.

I have a P3-800 with lots of RAM, but I use it almost exclusively for C++
and Java coding, debugging, testing and photo manipulation, and don't want
games contaminating the system with unnecessary files, so I've delegated the
task of playing EQ to my P233 MMX, since nothing more powerful is really
needed unless you plan on buying Luclin, which I don't.
