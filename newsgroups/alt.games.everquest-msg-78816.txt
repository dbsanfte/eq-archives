This is a fairly common topic on my servers messages boards (prexus)
The general concensus is bards are the most difficult to beat, which unless
you know their class probably won't understand why.

Necros suffer from resists.. when I was 59 I duelled a 60 necro for the
first time (expecing to get my ass handed to me) and the necro just couldn't
land anything except lifetaps (im a monk)

Rangers can be tough (nuke, snare, DS, root, TS), even druids.. fight a 60
druid with a 32point DS, with 2 1hb's and your gonna be dead before they are
(not to mention their heals, nukes, debuffs)

Good paladins can make fearsome duellers, good hp/ac, self heal, LoH, blind

I personally have never lost to a cleric... but a 60 rogue friend lost to a
57 cleric (I beat the cleric in the next fight) and that rogue would
probably hand my ass to me in a duel.

99% of duels is down to the player skill/tricks/knowledge.
