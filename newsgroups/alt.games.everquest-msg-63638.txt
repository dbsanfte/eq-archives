I just started playing again after a 6 month hiatus...I used to use a java-
based log parser that I quite liked...it'd tell me what my current skill 
levels were vs my current cap and various other detailed statistics on 
damage, fizzle rate, etc...

Anyone know what the name of the program is?  If there's something better 
available by now, that would be even better.
