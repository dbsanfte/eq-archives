	No, appeasement is when someone threatens you and you do what they say.

	Boo hoo.

	If our leaders have the will (and I freely admit that Bush probably
doesn't), yes.

	Remember Khadaafi?  He got reaaaaaal quiet all of a sudden after we
dropped bombs all around his palace (which, contrary to popular opinion, did
not miss their targets).

	Survival is a universal instinct.

	I don't care how they think.  I would only care what they think if they
were rational actors that could be negotiated with, and they've already shown
that they're not.  What matters is that we're bigger than them, we can hurt
them worse than they can hurt us.
