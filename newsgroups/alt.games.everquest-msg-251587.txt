An EQ truism for a long long time has been, soloing giveth the
experience, grouping giveth the loot. I see no reason to change this
(though by 65 most classes do better exp by grouping now anyways). The
stuff on PoFire minis is damn sweet but I don't argue that since I
don't have time to raid I should be able to solo for it.

If it makes you feel any better, the charm from PoP is better than
anything in LDoN or LoY by a factor of a thousand or so and is free to
anyone who reaches L50.
