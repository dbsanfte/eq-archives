I don't understand the fascination with knowing someone's legal name. 
Does it somehow tell you more about them?? unless you are into stalking
or want to sit in front of their house. Who cares whether I am StanMann
or Diana365 or Xena23 or jomomba.  As long as I keep the same handle.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when

aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
