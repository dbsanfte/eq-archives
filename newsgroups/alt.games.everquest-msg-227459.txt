DKP is the only way to go, whoever works hardest earns more points, bids on
more items and yes over time gets more loot makes more contribution to the
raiding guild and obviously will make greater use of the loot.
 There are a certain few items that most guilds would insist on a Class only
bid such as Enraging Blow weapons go to Warriors first, when all Wars have 1
then the rest of melee's can bid, who the hell wants a Ranger getting agro
??? These few items would be listed and well advertised to the guild.

Random sucks, as an example, a guild is working really hard, its there first
Vindi kill and whenever possible the guild races to Kael Drakkel to make an
attempt, sometimes there is another guild there first /sigh but after 4
attempts they now have the right strategy, all is planned for Fridays Vindi
spawn and the guild camps out Thursday night in Kael. Firday comes and the
guild clears to Arena and spends the next 3 hours clearing mobs waiting for
Vindi to pop, Johnny Comelately a guild shammy who hasnt played for 3 months
and is only a casual player logs in then races to KD, he gets a CoH to arena
just in time for Vindi to spawn, the pull is made and its a wipe, rezz re
buff and pull again, w00t !!!! Vindi down !!!! Gratz all well done, The
Vindi BP is there and the guild are Jubilant !!!! all that can use the BP
roll a random 5 555. Thug the 62 War that plays everyday and has Tanked
Vindi on every guild attempt rolls a 60 =( Johnny Comelately rolls a 501 and
walks away with a new BP and is not seen again for another 2 months.
 What use to the guild or the shaman is that ??????
