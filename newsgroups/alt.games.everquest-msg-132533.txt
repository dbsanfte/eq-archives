If your 2 y/o child (as opposed to some strangers child which your
poorly phrased question is open to) is asking you about AIDS or sex,
then you damn well better have some answers.  Do I expect you to provide
them with graphic depictions of sex acts or detail the horrors of AIDs?
No, but you damn well better have something to  say cause that kid is
asking you.  If they know enough to ask they are old enough for answers,
perhaps not the detailed answer you might give a 20 y/o, but answers. 
"Not now, when you are older" ain't gonna cut it, well not unless you
want your kids learning about life on the streets rather than at home. 
Once the bottle is  opened, once the question is asked, you can't stuff
the genie back into the bottle no matter how much you don't want to have
to deal with it.  Sure you can ignore it, but the kid won't.  If you
don't provide them with answers to their questions they will find their
own answers.  Of course if all you had in mind was to teach them hate
then again we find that maybe you do have the right idea, learning on
their own can't be worse and may be the best solution.

The parents who are shocked when their kids shoot up a school are the
ones who told them "not now" when the kid asked questions, the ones who
let the kids raise themselves rather than get involved in issues that
might force them to actually deal with their children.  Answering your
children's naturally curious questions is a far cry from giving them
complete freedom, but in that it does offer you an opportunity to free
them from ignorance and prejudice I can see where you might find a bit
too much freedom involved.
