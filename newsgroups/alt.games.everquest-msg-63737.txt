Well RAM aint that much of an issue, a 256 stick can be obtained at my
door for about 20 pound (30 dollars). The video card may become..irksome.

I am running a number of games under direct X8 already and they seem fine
so Im hoping that EQ will fly at least until such a time as I can get a
new vid card. However having said that my machine is supposedly below the
specs on a number of the FPS games I play multiplayer (operation
flashpoint for one) and it does still run like a dream..........

Maybe I just have to avoid the ol EC auction zone.....though I still cant
work out how to turn a channel off.... /channel auction doesnt seem to do
anything, nor did /channel auction off
