Do you mean cheaper because Iksars can't wear the Jaundiced Bone
Bracer and so don't have to spend the cash on one? :-)

I also have a question for higher level shamans--is the JBB really
that big of a deal?  I know some players have stated they chose not to
pick Iksar as their shaman race because they couldn't wear it, while
other players have said it's a nice toy but it's not that essential of
an item.

(but Iksars also have highest base WIS of all the shaman races, plus
have their own Scaled Mystic armor and some cudgel quests that are
supposed to result in a nice 1hb weapon)
