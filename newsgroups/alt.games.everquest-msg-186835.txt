    You should find the following procedure always works:

(1) Form the raid, no unflagged people, and zone all but one person (flagged
as a group leader) into the zone.
(2) Invite an unflagged person, have them zone into the target zone, then
disband from the raid. Camping resets the 3 minute timer, so while they wait
people may have to camp-cycle the timer a few times.
(3) Repeat step (2) until everyone unflagged is in zone, then invite the
unflagged into the raid.

    We've found that there's actually a bit of a buffer, in that you can
have less than 85% of the raid be flagged and people won't be booted. This
is likely to prevent a single linkdeath from porting 15% of your raid out.
Again, if you get in trouble with number of people, have the unflagged folks
start to camp-cycle until your numbers are back to what they should be.
