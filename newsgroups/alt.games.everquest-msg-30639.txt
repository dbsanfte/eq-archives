Absolutely not.  There is some free-for-all attitude in terms of competition
for some of the high-level quests, but as a newbie you have a year or more
before you have to worry about that.  Grouping is pretty standard in EQ.
Most classes are in fact incapable of soloing (for you nitpickers out there,
let's say ALMOST incapable) after they reach a certain level.

As an example, I usually group with two RL friends' characters.  One
character is a shaman, so the group gets buffs, damage spells, curses,
cures, and primary healing from her.  The other guy has a warrior, so the
group gets a powerful front-line combatant to pound on the enemies
hand-to-hand, and take damage so the flimsier characters don't have to.  He
also keeps  enemies off the shaman so she can continue casting.  My
character is a paladin, which means he fights close-up like the warrior, but
not as well.  However, a paladin also gets clerical magic, so he can
function as a secondary healer or toss the occasional Blind spell on a pesky
foe.  If the shaman was alone, she'd find it hard to keep groups of enemies
out of her face and continue casting.  If the warrior was alone, he'd have
to wait a looooong time after fights because he has no way to heal himself.
If my paladin was alone, he'd find that he couldn't quite hold his own in
close combat and he couldn't take out enemies at range, either.

Each of us does something the others can't, so the turnaround time for
healing and recovery is much lower, meaning the corresponding rate of xp
gain is much higher.  In AC you can build "do-it-all" characters, but the EQ
classes need each other for complimentary abilities.  You will constantly
see characters of many classes advertising that they want to group.

Note that many players are idiotic enough that you won't want to group with
them, but that's a different kettle of fish.
