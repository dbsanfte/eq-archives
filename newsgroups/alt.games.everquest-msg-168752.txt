I beg to differ.  Enchanters are the best soloers. - if you mean by what
they can take on and how much XP they can make, there's nothing that can
touch them.  If you mean *safe* soloers, well enchanters are about the
most hair raising experience for soloing out there.

I've charm soloed about half my levels - up to 54 so far, and still
taking out yellows, got a bit bored though after 50 when I realized I
could get to 60 this way, just the investment of time.  I still make
more than half again as much xp solo as in a really good group in a
really good spot.

As far as most wanted, I'd have to agree clerics are most wanted.  You
can also consider warrior, but IMHO thier soloing potential is even
lower than clerics, although I've known a few in my time that were very
good at it - especially trolls.

Pretty much I'd say play anything you want, and if you are any good
people will remember you and want you in groups.  Even if you are a
ranger... 

If you want to get in alot of groups, I'd probably avoid ranger and
druid, they are a dime a dozen, everyone seems to like to play the
nature boys - some people have problems with necros and mages as well,
as most don't know how to handle thier pets in a group.  And I know a
friend of mine has trouble with his wiz, not sure if thats his playing
or just wiz stigma.  Actually it's probably because he's on a modem
still and goes LD all the time, drives me nuts.
