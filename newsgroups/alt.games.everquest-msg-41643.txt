I couldn't bear to watch TV at all on Tuesday.  I couldn't bear to hear
about it.  I was too upset.

I'm grateful that I did have a world to escape to for a little while.
Norrath was a peaceful haven in which I could get my mind and heart to be
still for a while.  For many hours I stayed in a world that made sense.

I'm dealing with the tragedy better now.
