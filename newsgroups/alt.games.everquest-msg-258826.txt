That's what I'm hoping, too. Mostly, though, I'm just an MMOG junkie and
this is the next fix, I gotta try it. ;-)

Aye, SWG is at the top of the list of  "Biggest Disappointments" in gaming
history (next is probably Moo3). I try not to remember that the same
leadership team that was responsible for SWG is releasing EQ2. Maybe they've
even learned something from that launch. Rationalizations aside (see above),
I'm still looking forward to trying it.  There's always WoW around the next
corner, too.
