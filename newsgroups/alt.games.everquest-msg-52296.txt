Until the last patch or so, I was able to "Switch" back to EQ.  Lately, and
I'm not 100% sure it was the last patch that changed things, but now when I
switch back, I get a black screen.  I can move (I hear the sounds of my
feet, etc) and I can type blind but otherwise I now have to camp or quit and
restart EQ.

Anyone else with Win2K been having problems?
