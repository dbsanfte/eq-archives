Sony mentioned a week ago that they were testing out a new enchanter 
ability called "Swarm" or something like that?  Does anyone know how 
this ability works.  If you also know of some interesting skill and 
spell changes in store for ENC's over the next month or so do not 
hesitate to post the info.  I'm just curious because I have not found 
worthwhile group purpose or use for my level 59 ENC other than buffing 
and PLing.

Happy
