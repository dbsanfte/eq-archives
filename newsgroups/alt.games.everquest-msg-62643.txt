I had serious bugs after downloading the new patch
Installing an older videocard driver (12.41 instead of the newer 12.81 or
12.83) fixed any video problems.

I noticed the black-background-with-fires bug as well and reported it
in-game. No other glitches seen other then that one.

As a side note, my mouse-look speed is now fixed with the new DLL, woot !

I still have the slow-down when spell-particle effects are showing on-screen
though. This shouldn't happen with my pc I think:
amd 1.4GHz
1.5GB SDRAM
Creative GeForce 2 GTS
Soundblaster Live!

Oh well, I can live with that slow down :)
