I made a wizard and I PL'd her w/ my enchanter all the way to 55.  Then she
became a grouping kind of wizzie.

I was surprised at how easy it was - I used the color line stuns and then
did a PB AE w/ the wizzie.  Got her to 55 in 3 days.  I think I got wizzie
girl killed twice, but damn, people did hate us in zones when i would wipe
it out.  Also, it helped that the wizard had mind candy at all levels.  She
never really had to sit and med until about level 35-ish.  Then I got her a
horse and some flowing thougt, oh sorry, mana regeneration items.  She only
had about FT 4 from levels 1-35 and I put FT augs on her stuff as well.
She's only an alt, but she is max FT.  now her gimp mana pool is whole other
story...
