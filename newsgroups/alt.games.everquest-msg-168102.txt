I am talking about soloing with only small amounts of downtime.  Need lots
of bandages, bandage up to 50%, kill another blue.  I suspect in another
level or two, they will no longer be blue.  I can handle a single add as
well in this case.  My warrior is in mostly crafted, plus Skull Shaped
Barbute, and one or two other odd pieces.  Wielding an Ebon Razor, and
something else underwhelming, can't recall what off hand.
