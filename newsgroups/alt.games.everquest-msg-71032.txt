Yup, I understand their reasoning but it's flawed.  They still screwed up.
They should have actually tried to come up with some other way to handle it
than to say "bite me."

They could have given them the choice between that and compensated for time
lost + a bonus...a month of free access.  Doesn't make up for the $100 a
legit person is out, but it shows that they're taking responsibility for
their screw-up.

A couple ideas for evidence that they're using Win95:  A Xerox of the Win95
CD or CD case + a dxdiag.txt with a date/time that is exactly the same as
the file date/time.  Neither are proof but it's enough of a runaround that I
don't think most people would bother unless it was legit.
