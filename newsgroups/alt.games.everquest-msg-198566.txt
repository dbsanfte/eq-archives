Oh, I'm sorry but I have to disagree. Many people at those levels are
massively stupid. Take a look at Enron, Arthur Anderson, or the guy at Coca
Cola who decided "Hey, our unique product has kept us on top for about 100
years, but people in blindfold taste tests like Pepsi better. We have to
make Coke taste like Pepsi!" Hint: people don't by soda with blindfolds on,
DUH!

Have you ever read about a Fortune 500 company dismissing a high level
executive for poor performance, only to have a different Fortune 500 company
hire the same guy for an even higher position because of his "experience"?
It happens frequently.

People get to those levels for a lot of reasons other than their own ability
or intelligence. If you've got experience as an exec at another company,
you're in. If you have an MBA and belonged to a certain fraternity, you're
in. If your family is well placed socially or politically, you're in. If you
have a lot of money, you're in.
