I play a 53 Wizard.

As others have suggested, you set a cut-off point.  Chat to your raid leader
to make sure this is enforced.

Normally, once the groups have been formed and buffing has started is a good
point to choose.  Kindly inform those wishing to come that they should make
their own way to the event now, as they were not at the meeting place in
time.

Be flexible if whoever is coming is required for the raid (i.e. high level
tank with Defensive, enchanter....).  You don't want the raid to fail just
to prove a point.  :-)

My current annoyance:

People that want a port, hand over the cash, then say, "Oh, wait, I need to
buy X from (adjacent zone)".  Don't be surprised if I port the rest of the
group and leave you behind -- I am not being messed about.

Tris.
