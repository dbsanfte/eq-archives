Hi All

This is old news I know. But here is the confirmation EQ is dumping DX8 
for DX9 with no support available for older cards. But an Upgrade your 
video card discount deal available if your card cannot run DX9.

------------------------------------------------ Insert SOE Press 
Release ---------------------------------------------------------

Sony Online Entertainment has exciting news for all EverQuest players. 
As the world of Norrath evolves and expands, so too does the technology 
powering EverQuest. Sony Online Entertainment is making significant 
upgrades to the EverQuest engine which will allow SOE to provide players 
with the great game, but on a much more stable and efficient platform. 
SOE anticipates patching in the new engine sometime during the next 
month or two.

Part of this change will result in the need for all EverQuest players to 
upgrade to DirectX 9 (DX9), the latest version of Microsoft's 3D 
software. As best as SOE can determine, a very small percentage of our 
current EverQuest player base (less than 1%) may find that their older 
video cards are not compliant with DX9. To find out if a video card is 
DX9 compliant, players should check with the manufacturer of their card 
(video drivers may need to be updated as well). Players can also consult 
the EverQuest tech page on Sony Online Entertainment's website, located 
at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/tech_support.jsp.

Sony Online Entertainment is very concerned that even a small number of 
our players may have issues running EverQuest. To address this, SOE has 
worked out a deal with NVIDIA and eVGA.com to provide current EQ players 
access to discounts on a number of newer video cards that are DX9 
compliant. eVGA.com will be offering EQ players discounts on several PC 
video cards that utilize Nvidia technology, from the affordable GeForce 
FX 5600XT all the way up to the GeForce FX 5900 Ultra. Current EverQuest 
players can go to http://www.evga.com/eq/ to take advantage of this 
special offer.
