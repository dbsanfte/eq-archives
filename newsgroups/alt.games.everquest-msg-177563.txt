Nice try but doesnt hold water, these bugs scaled very nicely. 

What you are saying is that the way EQ is being patched is stupid and
thats ok cause its just a game. Problem is that from Sonys point of
veiw its not a game its a business. Which makes things like this even
more strange. I think we are all being used to test code for EQ2 sans
grapics. They needed to reduce bw load to make EQ2 work is my guess. 

Notice they have stopped bragging on setting account records,
subsciptions are dropping as is Sonys rep with its current customers.
Not good when bringing 2 new games to market soon.
