> I saw the below on EQ last night.  Has anyone been witness to "unique
> events"?

I was in my first GM "event" this past weekend (Sunday I
think) in OT.

The "event" involved them turning the sky red (yay) and
spawning dozens of normal Sarnaks (yay).

Talk about lame.

Oh yeah, I did a couple shouts to see if anyone had gotten
anything fresh from these "special" Sarnaks, and people
only replied that they got the usual loot (primarily plat).

Yay...

I don't know, maybe I'm too caloused, but I just can't get
excited at something as simple as spawning dozens of the
usual mobs to slaughter people (and, in case you're wondering,
no, I did NOT die and that is not the cause for "bitterness").

I've heard of GM events (events, not "events") where they
actually spawned Firiona and put-on a play with dialogue/etc.
That is an event.  Increasing the spawn rate of normal mobs
is an "event" that even my Mom would find lame.
