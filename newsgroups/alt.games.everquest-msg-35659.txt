*shrug* I feel it's my right to judge people simply by looking at them, or
if they do something a little differently.

"ty" coming from a stranger means "uh, I guess I should say something that
sounds sorta positive 'cause this ingrate who doesn't know that mana is free
is probably (actually, "prolly") expecting it, even though he doesn't
deserve it."  From a friend I don't even expect "thanks," so it doesn't
bother me.

Yup, "plz" is said by idiots.  Every single time.  Yup, my opinion, yup,
judging them by 3 random letters they choose to use to abbreviate "please."

"k" doesn't bother me in the slightest.  "kk" does...I mean, how cutesy and
stupid is that?

I have so many look-alike names that the only way people can avoid sanity is
to just use the first three letters.

I'm allowed to judge a book by its cover and I'll continue to do so,
thankyouverymuch.  And if you ask me to join your group and call me
"chanter," then I'll decide whether or not to ignore your lazyassed request
depending on what other offers I've received (and I usually get multiple
requests).
