I love it when people say stupid stuff like that.  I was in a group on
the Orc Hill in CB leveling up my new character and trying to get a
SBS.  The trainer and some cents spawned and we killed them.  Just as
we killed them some k3wl guy runs up and asks if he can loot the
trainer.  Really, we want to give away a chance at the SBS to some guy
who just ran up... what are people thinking?
