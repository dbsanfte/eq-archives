It's down to some hidden spell attributes.

Duration Formula

The game engine uses different methods to determine the 'chance' (#)
of the root lasting the maximum coded duration.  This might be broken
somewhat, maybe an uber Druid would know.

(#) perhaps it only performs the 'break check' every other tick, I
have no idea TBH, never seen it documented anywhere.

Resistance Check

Roots are checked versus Magic, the level 24 version is +25, level 39
is +15 and +0 for the level 49 version, the lower the number the
better chance you have of getting the root to stick.
