Ahah yeah, I was on the solusek ro server, one of the first ones. I
feel sorry for the people who powerleveled on it since Lower Guk was
kind of the only thing around for them to do and Sol B was not even
around for a while. I was level 27 I think on my slow leveling
character before the fear and hate plane were added even. I remember
because back then there was no minimum level to enter so a friend with
planes shaman boots called me into fear when more dropped, I missed
the arms by like half an hour when I logged = /.  I later went to
tribunal on a new character though and that shaman with fear plane
boots is now on Ayone ro (or whatever) just for giggles, though I've
never really played there.

Stuff is so cheap on an established server, I routinely sell things
like jade chokadai prods for 500 plat or less.. cause I get tired of
trying to sell them in 37 zones now. A shaman can easily afford 500
plat or so by the time they are level 30 or before even, untwinked.

Yep, I remember on trib server when my then new 22 level or so druid
constantly did the langseax quest which was made much easier for a
druid back then when spirit of cheetah worked the OLD way, cast JUSt
before zoning, run and cast AGAIN just before zoning in the next zone,
really cut down on non TP travel time along with being bound on one
end of the cycle.... I got so many langseax I was selling them for 10
plat each eventually and giving them to necro friends for their pets.

I sold a lot at like 20 or 25 plat at first, it was really the cat's
pajamas back then on trib. Now frankly I'd be embarrassed to even give
a newbie a langseax ;)

Darn good stuff is so dang cheap, even cleric quest armor and crafted
is sold super cheap on established servers and really its easier for a
newbie to save for those items  than to do the quest at the proper
level. I'm amazed when I see a newbie beg, everything comes so easily
now anyway.

Anyway, no matter what people say no high levels are going to be
career farmers of the CRAP that drops in the warrens or stonebrunt.
The only item they might farm in stonebrunt is from something blue to
them. In fact, my FIFTY FIVE druid attacked that blue to me gorilla
there and it RESSED my ensnare and root 99 percent of the time. Later
I noticed a 56 druid had engaged it and seemed to have no trouble, it
was certainly blue to him also. I guess 56 was the cut off point sort
of ;)  The thing is, for being blue to me and so hard that mob drops a
PIECE OF CRAP which also happens to be ONE OF THE BEST ITEMS IN THAT
ZONE. Again, I have to wonder the purpose of the trivial loot code
there. Oh, wait, thats right the purpose is so my 55 druid even has no
reason to kill stuff that is blue to it there (since the loot SUCKS
ASS and is no drop TO BOOT) yet I can't do any of the quests there to
raise kejeken faction simply for fun. OH YEAH but If I did the quest
I'd surely be SOMEHOW stealing kills from a lower level person WHO IS
STRANGELY ABSENT AT 2 AM WHEN LIKE 10 PEOPLE ARE IN THE FREAKING ZONE
AND ITS TOO DAMN HARD IN THE AREAS I WAS RUNNING AROUND FOR ANYONE
THAT LOW ANYWAY. That zone is so screwed up, with red mobs that are
super fast hanging around the blue mobs a lower level would kill. You
literally see the landscape littered with corpses.

The trvial loot code is not helping people in that zone. Its not
helping lower players, in fact its hurting them by not even having
high level support players like ressing clerics in that zone since 
THERE IS NO REASON FOR THEM TO BE THERE since they can't even have
"faction building fun break time." The trivial loot code is also
certainly not helping the higher level player who might want to raise
factions and certainly doesn't want any of that crap, not even really
from the couple mobs who ARE blue to him/her.

Brad McQuaid is dead wrong also when he says if anything it keeps the
info from hitting the spoiler sites. I mean all the freaking info was
on Allakhazams of every dang drop or quest practically TWO FREAKING
DAYS after the zone went up. OH YEAH BRAD, BOY GLAD THOSE NEWBIES DID
NOT HAVE IT SPOILED FOR TWO FREAKING DANG DAYS. Most newbies could not
even make it to the zone in that time, way the hell over there in the
middle of BACKWARDS ASSED NO WHERE LAND. 

GIVE ME A FREAKING BREAK, I'm so tired of these mmorpg makers and
there bald faced lie PR crap. The funny thing is they actually fool
some players. Or maybe they actually delude themselves, he SEEMS to
actually think that it really MAKES a difference. God.. Actually I
just looked and Aug 29, the day the zone was live or the day after,
Allakhazams has a ton of stuff up. Aug 30 he has the rest. This is
like only 12 days or so after he suffered a death in his family also
so his site might not be the most updated in the world. 

Oh, and here is the POS gloves, one of the two best items from that
zone from a mob blue to my 55 that it can't snare:

ac 3 str 4, dex 5, sta 2, all all.

AND THEY ARE NO DROP, ahaha. The 56 druid did not even want them and
asked me if I did, of course I did not either, finally he was calling
out to lower levels to loot them. 

OH YEAH, BOY THOSE WOULD BE FARMED TO DEATH BY HIGH LEVELS. Oh wait,
only high levels can get those.. so what is the point of the trivial
code again? OH THERE IS NONE.

The footpads of the tiger, only item that drops in this zone is off a
mob of about level 40. That means its going to still be blue to a
level 52 or so I think so once again farming is not really going to be
prevented at all. He is also a rare meaning a druid or ranger of
around 52 will spot him quite fast if actively looking before some
level 35 or something group does.

AAHH oh in fact the quote under themis by a 51 druid, so I am close in
my ASSumption:

"Killed it twice in the span of about an hour tonight. The first time
he dropped TWO pairs of these. They are lore so could only grab one.
The second time it dropped one pair. I gave mine to a druid and then
looted the pair on the tiger for myself. I got exp both times as a
level 51 Druid. I could not snare it. I just feared, dot'd and hit it
repeatedly with starfire. It went down fast. If anyone knows the price
on these I would love to know. 

Footpads of the Tiger Ac 6 Str 10 Agi 5 Hp 15 MNK BST"

Guess that makes them best boots for monk short of planes, kind of.

http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6898&mid=99923024745664

The stuff seems pretty snare resistant I guess, but there is really no
difference between a level 60 killing that mob or a level 51 to the
other people in the zone. The level 60 probably would have better
things to do anway, so between this and the no drop POS gloves we can
see that the trivial loot code only really accomplishes one thing in
stonebrunt:

It keeps my druid from doing some crappy quests which won't hurt a
single other player which I want to do only for faction fun. Its not
even faction that has a POINT AT ALL since its ONLY FOR THINGS IN THAT
ZONE! This makes it not even likely that many other people would
bother.

God, if stonebrunt is a semi preview of Luclin - which will also have
that code, it will really suck. Its really kind of ironic, seems like
the POS gloves should be droppable (might get 20 plat out of them, if
lucky) while those boots should be no drop so only a monk or beast
lord wants to get them. But, what do we see happening in both of those
cases? That is right, we see the problem solved by the OLD RULES of no
drop rather than by trivial loot code which is moot.

A further irony of what Brad and Absor say? Absor says your other
characters can experience the content in trivial loot zones (oh yeah,
cause someone who works 40 hours a week and has a level 52 character
they want to play ONLY, really has the time to level a few more
characters to 20, 26, 35, etc.) yet BOTH my cleric of innoruuk level
37 (glower dubious) and my troll sk of cazic level 31 (SCOWL!) can't
do the quests with the kejeken at all and  NO KILLS raise the faction
to a point where you can. My dark elf MIGHT be able to if I collect
stuff then use that one use halfling mask from her cleric quest, but
the troll is SOL. At least the troll has fun killing the wandering
kejeken SONS OF BITCHES who are blue to it and don't like it, VIVE LE
TRIVIAL ASS COMBAT CODE!
