As it appears again.. you missed it.... it was a joke...
I myself sometimes refer to usenet as a board.... that is because I go
back to the BBS days when there wasnt an internet...
Apple ][e is the days with my applecat modem... 900 baud... hacking my
way around the world...

Jeezz Satnmann,  Lighten up.... life would be so sweet without the
petty comments and bitching...

Peace
