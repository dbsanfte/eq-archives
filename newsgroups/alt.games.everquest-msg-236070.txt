> the train increased logarythmically 

I think the word there you want is "exponentially" - i.e. the train
got bigger as more and more mobs got aggroed, by mobs who got aggroed,
by mobs who got aggroed by you etc. :)

But seeing as logs and exponents are related (they are the inverses of
each other) I guess your point is gotten across no matter what word
you use :)
