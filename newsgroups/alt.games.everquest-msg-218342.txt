I'm being the fucktard? You're the one who seems to feel that the
parents are to blame for a result that they could very well have had
*NO* way of predicting. That's not only completely naive, but
pig-headed.

Parents have full responsibility for the upbringing of the child, yes.
But they have no control over their own genetics or what traits come
through in their offspring, especially for traits that either are
uncertain to be genetically linked or weren't known to be until only
recently.
