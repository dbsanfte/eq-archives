}60Hz is also synchronous with A/C current switching rate (in North 
}America at least) and is the refresh rate on your regular old 
}televisions largely because it is 'adequate' and electrically convenient.

Yea... Actually, that is a good argument for not using a refresh rate 
close to 60Hz, as you're likely to run into beat-frequency problems.  
Especially as others have pointed out, in conjunction with fluorescent 
lighting.

}FWIW - In Europe the PAL format is at 50Hz.
}Nobody has ever, in my memory, complained that the refresh rate on their 
}television was inadequate on either continent.

Heh.  Never hung out with a European forced to lookat our substandard 
televisions, eh? :)  I think the issue there is more the interlacing 
someone else mentioned, and America's completely inadequate number of 
lines per screen.  PAL is noticeably better, but I don't think the refresh 
rate is the issue, really.  Refresh rate makes a handy red herring though. 

}Clearly anything over even 50fps is nothing to get that excited about.

Well, not quite -clearly-, but this does lend weight to that argument. :)
