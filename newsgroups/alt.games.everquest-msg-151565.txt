In the hole last night I ran into a 51 or 52 Shaman and a anon character.
Being there wasn't anyone else there I (60 Warrior) and my alt (48 Cleric)
and a 50 Druid. I was killing everything upstairs. When this Shaman and his
buddy try to Claim the Crusaders and the Golem. Quoteing Verants PNP I had
to Share the camp so they were taking the lower half. I told them they are
welcome to the Warriors. They then take the wandering  Crusader when he pops
and we moved to the area of the Golem. Next thing I see is this Crusader
headed down to the pit with a pet chasing it down and the 2 of them
following. Doing a /who I see the Shaman and his partner are LD hear the pet
die and 3 Crusaders all over the Cleric and Druid while I am engaged with
the Rock Golem I manage to Taunt the Crusader off the Druid so he can Succro
us out. Later that night I bring up my Cleric to give him some stuff to sell
while logging the warrior on he gets trained, When my Warrior gets on I see
the Shaman running back in the Hole looking for his Alt and here comes
another train. I swim for the zone with the Shaman in front of me. I ended
up zoning first and the Shaman pops in just as I am about to zone back.
Needless to say an Ogre Shaman blocks the zone for a Barb Warrior I as him
to move a couple times and he says he is medding. I end up drowning and he
is wondering why I am pissed and says I should have an Enduring Breath Item
to fight in the Hole. Results 1 dead Cleric in WL and 1 dead Warrior in the
Nexus.
