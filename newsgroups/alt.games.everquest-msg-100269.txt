 Because it's up and we're bored. Not much else to kill 4 days after a
patch. Plus there are still a few upgrades for people there. Phara drops
a few nice items. We have a lot of casters ourfitted in Azure Sky robes.
The green scale can be sold for 100k or whatever for guild peridot
funds. Veeshans Peak is just fun, really. It's fun to see how fast it
can be cleared these days.
