Cats can't be enchanters, as far as I know, so you're stuck going to the
expansion (or original game in your case) that sells those spells...for the
most part.

You can get all your non-research spells except Kunark and Velious spells in
your starting city (some require a trip to HHK).

You'll have to go to Kunark to buy Kunark Expansion vendor spells.
You'll have to go to Velious to buy SoV Expansion vendor spells.
You'll have to go to Shadowhaven to buy SoL Expansion vendor spells.

Katta (Luclin) also has a vendor you'll want to see...he sells some
research-only spells.  I don't happen to recall if Mesmerisation (AE Mez,
level 16) is one of them.
