  Hm, I remember the conclusion most people came to that it was either
problems with EQ's engine or people's hardware drivers, and not DirectX that
was causing the problems.  DirectX, to my understanding, is supposed to be
backwards compatible with previous versions.  If it weren't, MS would
probably give us a supported option to revert to a previous version of
DirectX, which they don't.  I think the reason a lot of GMs, Guides and
techs were recommending reverting to DX7 was because, frankly, they did not
know what the hell they were talking about.  Such chaos ensues after these
sorts of patches that they scramble to come up with ANYTHING which MIGHT, on
some rare chance, fix their problem.  And if it doesn't?  At least it keeps
the "whining players" out of their hair for a little while.  I could be
wrong, but this was my perception of the situation.

  But you're probably right that there is no real need for EverQuest to
utilize the VERY latest version of DirectX.  Whenever I read a hardware
review for the GeForce3 or RADEON 8500, when the reviews go over the merits
of their "full support of DX8/DX8.1", they always comment that "no games out
there utilize these features yet anyway, so...".  I doubt Verant is THAT far
ahead of the curve.
