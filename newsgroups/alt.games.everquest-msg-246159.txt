You run 3 EP chars with plenty of AA's, but don't know how DT works?..

Any old world DTing mob isnt limited by range or damage before they cast DT
(Luclin DT is different.. but thats not really DT)

Nope its much more common than that.

Yes

No

305?

Not a lot.  Last time I did PoF demis (3 r/l people, a few 2boxed chars) I
could tank without heals until the point I got DT'd.  Any melee class with
minor healage will be suffice here.  My rogue (gimp hp, like 4.x k unbuffed)
tanked it after my monk eat a DT

> 4. Do you think this is possible?

Group makeup was me+rogue, cleric+ranger, enc+wiz.

Enc or Ranger took initial DT (you need to sacrifice somebody to pull it).
The casters were of limited use (immune to enc nukes, highly resistant to
wiz nukes except shit ratio lures) Then we burned it down, taking 1 more DT
before he died.
