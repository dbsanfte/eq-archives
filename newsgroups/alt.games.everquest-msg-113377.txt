Ah the great biz belches LoL
Not for me to decide the manner a person chooses to test his limits
nor is it yours outside that tiny mind you pack around. In my day we
tramped the friendly land and skies of Southeast Asia at government

man aint crazy and I think its cool what he did..so why does that
disturb you? Thanks for your support and kiss my arse on the way out.
