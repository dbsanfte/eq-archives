I just didn't loot period, to have money to need changing.  When I did start
looting, PP was the only thing I kept.  Sure trading gold to PP would be
nice, but it generally wasn't worth the hastle, and the minute I went
overweight, all gold, silver and copper got dumped on the floor

Oh yeah, virtually every PP attempt agros me.  I was raiding on Patch day
(zone crash bug) and trying to raise PP skill on my rogue....

PP shadowhaven guard

Its raised to 4 in Echo, gave the red message about no traps, but still
skillup

I think ima sweet talk my hon and get her to raise it.  She likes doing
trade skills..  same difference huh.   (Rogue isnt on my main acct (which
nobody has access to) so im a lil more open with this one!)   Ditto for
poison stuff!

Yeah sounds like what I need to do.

> I can't see why not, but then, this is EQ.  Ask in rogue channel?

No clue what the rogue channel is... anyway Id bet it was like the monk
channel..  a LOT of people, mostly dipshits, spamming "WHATS BEST HUMAN OR
IKSAR????!?!?�!?�?!?�?!�?!?�"
No thanks.

Anything more than ~15 ppl in a channel and it gets difficult to follow.. my
friends channel is upto 7 ppl (and about 20 bots haha), and we decided altho
xxx,yyy,zzzz would be nice in there too, its just gettin too big

You need to get into PoP planes then.

Hehe that would be amusing.

Im multi-skilled.. I pull, I heal, I kill !
Why not just shoot at mobs as they come to camp?  If the group won't let you
pull, they can't stop you doing that at least.

Ditto.. but I think throwing will be best, cuz we can right-click summon
throwies..  but I don't see a rogue usable tolans bracer!

Seems like too much of an exploit really.
