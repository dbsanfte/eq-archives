I'd credit him with a bit more integrity, to be honest. I doubt that he
would go from where he was before the summit, to where he was
after the summit just because Smedley bought him a beer. Particularly
not when the testimony of other people that were there corroborated
him.

Well, we'll see in time, won't we? Hey, I'm not just pointlessly playing
Devil's advocate, if you go onto the official forums, even, you can see
how much more open they are being about communicating with the players.
That's an improvement, because you can actually have a say in what
you think is wrong with the game and what can be improved. If all
people have to say to that is "Ha! I don't believe it" or "your DX9
engine sucks and you should scrap it" or "EQ's dead", then I don't
see that line of communication staying open for long... but hey, you
do with that what you will.
