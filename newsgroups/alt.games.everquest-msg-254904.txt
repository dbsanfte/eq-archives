I've completed an adventure sucessfully where two people have dropped
out. I'm about 50/50 on sucesses when people have dropped out. It all
depends on when the person has dropped and how hard the mission is.
Besides, just disband the person befoe you complete the mission and
they don't get any points anyway.

There are some people that can actually open them safely. Though
honestly I've never bothered.
