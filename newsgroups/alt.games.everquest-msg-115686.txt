Don't have SoW yet ( and I don't beg buffs ) so it takes me alittle
while to get from Kelethin to the docks in BB. Got on a boat to
Freeport, planning on getting off the boat and swimming to rocks.
Never saw any rocks !!   The first time the boat zoned right back into
BB, like we never left the harbor. Next time we zoned, we dropped
right down to the bottom south position and I had to ride all the way
to freeport.  Decided to ride back and see what happened, no rocks.
One more try, no rocks on the way to freeport, and zoning actually
kicked me out of the game this time. Got back in, still on the boat,
this time I got off in Freeport just so I could gate home.  Run over
to orc hill and kill the first orc I ran into just so I could say I
did something in my 2 1/2 hours online.  What's wrong with the boats
??
