If you think it sucks on your system (I presume you are playing on a desktop
system with a mouse?), try it on a laptop!  I sometimes play on my Powerbook
(point in favor of Blizzard on general principle--WoW comes with both PC and
Mac versions in the box, and, unlike EQ for the Mac, the PC and Mac players
are on the same servers), and dealing with the fixed window positions with a
trackpad is annoying.
