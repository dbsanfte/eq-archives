It doesn't. It just puts it in perspective. Microsoft didn't invent cut throat business.
People act like they are the only ones doing it.

Its like be outraged at the local liquor store for watering down the whiskey
and going to the sheriff, when the sheriff has been embezzling local
taxes, and expecting to get justice.

Our government has stolen and wasted more of our money than Microsoft
could do in a hundred years. Yet people go crying to the government about
how 'unfair' Microsoft and Billy G are and demand justice. I find that very funny.
