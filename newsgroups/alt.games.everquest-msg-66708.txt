Umm... Are you from Lanys?
Do you play any chars there that I might know?
Or was it just because I might have mentioned such
a thing here in the group?

Can't remember...
Thing is, I didn't movelog on the first wave, but
then on the extended movelog where you had to apply
via email....

Am kinda wondering about the attention I was getting from you there :)
