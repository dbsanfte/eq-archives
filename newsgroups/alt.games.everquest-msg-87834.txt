    I imagine the spawns in question are raid targets like Vindi, Velious
kings, etc. Not the sort of mob casters take down solo. :-)  The old problem
was as follows: patch ends. People in time zone X log on as soon as patch
ends, kill mob Y that spawns every Z days on the dot. People in later time
zones never get a shot at mob Y, as it always spawns at the same time of day
(when it gets killed by people in time zone X again).  Since the people
complaining about this are American players, you knew it would change.

    This ends all whining to GMs about "it should still be ressable,
really!" or "Why did it poof? Oh, I WAS logged on another server...." Always
look for the other reason. :-) There's a few things in this patch that are
actually large-scale nerfs of shady tactics.

    Heh. Wasn't any water for trade skills like Smithing. It was an
oversight, just like the hilt molds being removed from Freeport during the
vendor expansion there.

    Note: "limited supply". They will sell out. And HQ Ore is of use for
Ornate Chain (which has no use, and is a poor substitute for Fine Plate for
skilling up) and Human Cultural.

    Of the two products listed above, one (human cultural) still requires
Tempers. Tempers are still buggers to get.

    Pelt and silk vendors would do about as much for smiths, believe it or
not. Leather Backings are the big holdup for most smiths that want to power
skill up.

    Bet it was an even better surprise to the first guild that used it to
get mobs from behind locked doors.
