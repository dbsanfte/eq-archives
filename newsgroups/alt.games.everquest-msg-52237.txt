Some people still can depending on your vid card and drivers.

This is the way that you can do it using EQ only (if you can with your
graphics card):

You go into general stuff (in EQ) and change "show same size res" to
OFF or NO or whatever. Then you need a regular res that is not 640x
480 in EQ. What happens then is when you go inventory or change view
or something you go to the 640 x 480 one. 

So then you alt tab and eq will be minimized on the task bar and you
are in windows. to get back into EQ, you click on it on the taskbar
and hit that change view or res or whatever key again (don't know what
it is originally but on mine it is F9.
