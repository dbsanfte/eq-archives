While the space warp is an oddity (happens to me occaisionally) the debuff
thing is a "feature."

If your current HP when you zone is less than your natural HP with no
equipment or buffs, then all your buffs get stripped off.

As the past couple characters I've run have both used a substantial
body of HP gear, I've learned to know this little feature well.  I'll
literally stop at the zone line and cast some heals on myself if I
can manage it.

If you aren't twinked, but do happen to get some powerful HP
buffs from a passing stranger, this is a bigger concern than usual.
While my druid is annoyed to have to reapply his barbcoat and
wolf form, thats just the price he has to pay for the safety of the
zone line.  On the other hand, he'll do almost anything to avoid
zoning heavily injured if its going to cost him clarity (unless he's
grouped with that chanter, of course, then its back to inconvenience)
