Actually, you should have gone ahead and bought the whole package. (The 
CDs themselves, nor the keys give you accounts. Your money does.)

When you install, the setup checks your system and installs only what it 
needs.

For example, I have been downloading the files for OOW for the last 
couple of weeks. When I installed from the CD, nothing was actually 
installed. In fact, the only program that even started was the setup.

In fact, all you really need is the key, not the CD.
