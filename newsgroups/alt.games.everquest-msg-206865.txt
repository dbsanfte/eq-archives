I don't think its a requirement for TiV, much in the same way I don't think
a warrior is an absolute requirement.

We did a 2 group TiV very early on in PoP, so he's by no means difficult -
but every little helps when a guild is struggling to kill him.

Btw im not even sure we had RC when we first did TiV, let alone GRC!  He was
the first mob we killed in Luclin (killed him the same day as AL(i think?) -
whenever he very first died serverwide), back in the days of him being
pullable.
