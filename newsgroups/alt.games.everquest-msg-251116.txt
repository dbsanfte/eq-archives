I guess it all depends what matters to you in a theater.  There was one in 
Oakland I absolutely loved, called the Parkway.  First, they showed movies 
I wanted to see, mostly cult classics.  Second, they didn't have the usual 
theater seats, they had couches with tables in front of them, which made 
it sooo much easier to cuddle with your date comfortably.  Third, and 
possibly most importantly, the concession stand sold beer and good, 
fresh-cooked to order pizza, which the ushers would bring to your table 
when it was ready.

Damn, I miss that place.
