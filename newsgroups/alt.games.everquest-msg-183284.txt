Well, like any expansion the new zones were packed, Gukthar crashed on
BB...hardly surprising with 130+ ppl in it. Bazaar had on 35 traders up when
I logged in...Guess all the second PC's were running Froggies and getting
P/L'd.
Less problems than expected, every new feature (I tried) seemed to work and
I didn't end up looking at my desktop at any point, while wondering WTF just
happened. I don't think I'll bother with new zones just yet, let the novalty
wear off of the farmers first. Frogs have invaded every newbie zone there is
My Dark Elves birth place is full of homeless Troll refugees and his home,
Qeynos, is full of Frogloks..lol, I don't want to see Innothule Swap, must
be like Cane Toads in Australia's NT.

Only complaints I have about LoY so far are that the Armour Dye seller looks
like the Erudite version of Pink and there is a rather off puting animation
on the Female Troll's breasts when they get hit which I had never noticed
previously...Ok so I had never hit a female Troll previous to LoY but if
it's new to the expansion then someone in SOE has far too much spare time
and needs help :�)

I wonder if SB mnts will now get some use or will it just become a
thoroughfare to get to new zones.

Oh and the loading screen shows a Troll swinging a 2hblunt weapon with both
hands, obviously not an ingame screen shot then :�/
