Based on Clintons intel? People were coming up with intelligence left
and right, and when we went in there were none. Many say they went to
Syria.

Supposing they had to rip you apart to get material to do research,
that has not provided one positive result as of yet. The Nazis were
executed for performing experiments providing data that we now
currently use. Are you suggesting we repeat those experiments?

In the 1800s we assumed black people were animals, and we treated them
like less than humans. If a master murdered a slave, no matter the
circumstances, he pleaded his right to do what he wished with his
property. We fought a war to define humanity. We fought it again in
the 1960s.

Just as a man is a man no matter the color. I think a human being
starts life at conception.

It vanished with 9-11. An economy bouyed by low taxes and interest was
the only thing keeping us afloat in the post 9-11 recession. We lost
many jobs on 9-12.

Most Democrats will act as if 9-11 never happened. Anything Bush did
in response to 9-11 never happened. America knows a lot better.

The previous tax cut was Reagan, are you calling the prosperity that
Reagan started magic? No it was good economics. When business have
lower tax loads, and lower taxes means more money can be invested,
everyone does better.

It kept America afloat. Most businesses are having problems geting
people to work in the plants. In Florida, you would not believe the
job openings for engineers and factory people.

Talk to some Iraqis. I have. The dead enders are a minority, and
mostly foriegn born terrorists. There are forces trying to hijack the
Iraqi people.

There was never a plan to take oil for the invasion. This was denied
early on.

Everyone thought it unlikely. How many intel reports of plots do you
think the government gets?

Kerry is the candidate of Osama Bin Laden. He thinks he can dance
circles arounds us while Kerry thinks he can negotiate with people who
simply do not want a strong America. It if helps us, they are against
it.

As we speak Kerry is dumbfounded by OBL speaking to America endorsing
him for President. I think that is the best free ad to make this a
landslide.
