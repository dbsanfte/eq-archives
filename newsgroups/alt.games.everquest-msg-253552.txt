Dad's sentiment is charming, but I swear it sounds like a rehashed Garrison Keillor line.

You can not hope to build a 4-cylinder motor that will produce as much torque as a V-8
built to the same level.

Torque is what makes streetable cars fun to drive.  It kicks you in the pants when you
stomp the gas pedal, it pulls boats up ramps, it hauls 80K# tractor/trailer combos over
the Rocky Mountains (although a lot of road tractor motors are big I-4s or I-6s).

Torque > all IMO.  And torque in copious amounts is never found in streetable 4 cylinders,
or in small V-6s.  The torque monster lives large in streetable big V-6s and I-6s, V8s,
V10s and V12s.

Fast and the Furious be damned - those kiddies in the hot-rod Civics with all the vinyl
stickers on the doors never run straight-line for pinks against anything with more than 1
catalytic converter.  They're smart - why give some other guy a free lunch?

Still, there is something to be said for the weight savings of a 4 over an 8.  That
translates directly translate to handling prowess, in a properly set-up chassis.

But if your chassis isn't set up correctly....well, that's why a $20k 4-year old Corvette
drives circles around a Civic SI with +10k of aftermarket mods.  All the polyurathane
bushings and exotic-alloy sway bars in the world don't mean a thing when that big V8 is
popping that heavy car out of a switchback like gas through a funnel, or eggs through a
hen, and you're back at the apex of the turn, fighting peaky understeer and violent
chassis shake from those hodge-podge suspension upgrades.

And don't even get me started on "streetable" +3 tire upgrades, when the rest of the trick
suspension parts aren't in the mix.

That being said, there is a point where horsepower wins out.  Particularly, wherever
you're looking for sustained output in a narrow power band.  Think Brickyard and you're
headed the right way.  Swimming pool pumps, too.
