Brewing is the easiest tradeskill to raise to 250 (although pottery
and baking are rivaling it now). For the 8th shawl, you'll also need
to learn the potentially expensive jewelcraft, the new PITA smithing,
easy fletching, and the utter heartbreak of tailoring. 7th needs drops
from stuff in Kael and SG, and 8th needs drops from geonids and velium
hounds, and ends in escorting a coldain around iceclad and protecting
it, something you don't need an uberguild for but do need people of
some skill for.
