I have DSL Connection and 3 computers in the house all using that connection
from a router. LYNKSYS Brand etehrnet/cable router and a Wirespeed DSL modem
that the Lynksys router is connected to. I have 3 accounts and myself , my
wife and my son can all be on together at the same time and not even notice
any difference. The Lynksys Router has a built in firewall and each computer
is also using black ice defender for extra protection . No problems at all .
