That might work, however people dont like being told the value of something
they want to know it for themselves.  Also due to the fact that eq does have
an economy and prices will fluctuate it makes the game more interesting.  EQ
often releases a new weapon and then afterwards tweeks it because they dont
know exactly how its going to be used or how its going to perform in the
many settings its going to be used.  Sometimes an item is revised years
later because Sony finaly gets it through thier heads that it needs to be
revised.  I still think that a web site that actualy shows dammages for a
weapon real time would be popular enough to even out the economy and effect
caps on weapons and items that are way overpriced.
