Is it an ability you can live without? If so then I think it should be an
AA, as most AA's skills are things you can live without but add an edge to
your gameplay / style.

Ranger ranged damage, seems like a basic ability, why isnt improved archery
damage inate? (takes 45aa to get to eq/am3).

BUT rangers CAN live without eq/am3, but with it you have an extra option,
like pet hold.

In terms of importance to the relevant class's, yes, eq/am3 is probably more
of an asset to a ranger than /pet hold is to a pet class, but both are not
required by said class to function well, imo.

Another 7am post so again, bare that in mind ^_^
