I have been playing for almost 2 years, I used to never roll on items
not usuable by me.  But if you ever level 10-11 (can't remember which)
youd know that spells are expensive. 102pp for all the level 12 spells
Thats approximately 600 cloth armor (which is your average loot at
this level). Thats a lot of orcs.  considering 1 in 3 with drop that.
You could carry rusties, but the time running back and forth will eat
the profitability. Everyone will race you for a chance of a cracked
staff too. Bonechips currently see there for 1-2pp a stack (used
mainly for exp/faction quest which yeilds 2 rusty weapons).  All this
you would perhaps understand, if you hadn't ebayed.

As for reputation, I have absolutely no trouble getting groups.  I
usually get about one tell an hour from previous groupies.  Mainly
because i do my job and participate 100%, and add real value to a
group, which people respect.  I receive compliments on my playing, and
pretty much now only playing with people i've grouped with before.

But, NBG is something that is a deciding factor for me in a group. 
Why would i want to camp somewhere for something i can't have? Am i
selfish? of course.  No one is going to buy my spells for me, i must.
