About 20 of us started newbie gnomes, turned in our PvP books and started
running for Erudin.  The fastest two people made it there in an hour.  I
took an hour and a half 'cause I died once and had to start from scratch (of
course).

Yeah, I'd have to agree that running from EC to NK without SoW ain't no big
feat.
