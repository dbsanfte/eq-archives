Then you haven't been listening.   Allow me to repeat seconding his opinion.

You have "some idea."    He has actually experienced it, as have I.

Yep, you could say it.   You'd be dead wrong, but you could always say it.
Qualified enough to comment, maybe.   But you're not just commenting, you're
attempting to armchair quarterback something that you have never done.
Experience is one hell of a better teacher than reading short summary
descriptions of what is involved.

I'm shocked.  Or something.

No, you apparently don't.   Yes, the words are all there, but none of the
comprehension.  Your comments on the trials make this clear.

And now we come full circle.  What you're actually suggesting in this
sentence is guildwide guilt trips on the small group capable of passing the
trials.  We can't do it without a tank... well, the guild only has one tank
with a really good shot of tanking the executioner successfully, so get him
over here yet again!

Or were you suggesting random tells to every level 65 warrior listed on
/who?     Once again, I'd like to see you try this method before telling us
how sure you are that it is just that easy.

So you just spent an hour or two flagging a shaman.  Great!.  That will give
our overworked warrior a good break.  We'll just run a 2 shaman trial group
instead.

It just doesn't work that way.  A family guild spread out among a range of
levels will generally only have enough members (of the correct levels and
classes) to make one good trial group.  When you can barely pass it with
your best "first stringers", what chance do the second stringers have, which
were powered through one at a time by the first group?

Well, the fact that they spent the 6 months prior to the release of PoP
farming Vex Thall may have had something to do with it.    When your tanks
have weapons raising them to "damage class" levels of DPS, and your
spellcasters all have Flowing Thought 15, it's a hell of a lot easier to get
everyone past.

Those of us without that advantage leveled up, in some cases all the way to
65, while making repeated attempts to get past the trials.

Odd, you said just that to me in another message.

In response to me saying that I was the best tank they had, and was thus
everyone needed me if they were going to get past, such that if I helped
every single one I would never do anything else...  your response was...

And what do you suggest, oh expert on the high level game?   Should I go
hold a gun to thier heads and force them to play more hours per week so they
level up faster?   Attempt to impose some kind of guild sanctions on a
player that dares go for AA over regular leveling?   Try to get people to
leave thier passwords with me so I can log in thier character to exp?

And to respond to your other message all at once.....

Once again, great in theory.  In real world applications it just does not go
down like that.
