Kiss your account goodbye. Anyone who plays EQ knows that Verant
frowns on hacking, and is heavy handed on the punishment, which is a
good thing. If they weren't, there'd be tons of cheaters out there.
Just from the number of people that have gotten banned in the past for
things like this, you should have known what the outcome would be.
While I'm not sure if your address and credit card are blacklisted, I
am sure that you will have to get another account, which means you
will have to buy another set of game CDs.
