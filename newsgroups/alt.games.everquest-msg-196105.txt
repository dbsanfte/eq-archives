Don't that just beat all?  It wasn't enough that Horses were next to
useless for melees (especially non-hybrid melees), they had to go the
extra mile to ensure that, contrary to historical example, they are
strictly disadvantageous to melees in all circumstances.  So now
Horses in EQ are just a goofy Meditation aid for casters and a
patheticly limited travel aid.  They oughta just shoot the poor things
and put 'em out of their misery.
