Well, I went through some -very- old screenshots, and found a couple of 
places that now qualify as -impossible- to reach. :)

This may also provide some insight into why I occasionally miss the 
featured attractions of these pictures.  And the first case revels in 
the joy of the now nearly useless faction system.  :)

There's also a picture at the bottom of the most stylish gear zinny has 
ever sported.  It's an Insidious Robe.  No, really!  Yay that time the 
cache thingy got bugged. :)

(Note, I spent 12.67 seconds making this webpage, so you may have to 
scroll down for pictures #2 and #3.  My apologies.)

>Anyone ever manage to survive a jump to the bottom of the Hole?

Oh yes.  I made a newbie erudite SK for precisely that purpose, named 
Plummet. :) She survived provided I hit /q and relogged at exactly the 
right moment.  I also seemed to survive fairly regularly with a level 5 
Halfling Rogue of Brell, provided I tossed her an SLN first.
