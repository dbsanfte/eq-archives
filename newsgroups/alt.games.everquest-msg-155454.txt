My point was that <only> KEI lasts long enough, and that even so there's
no assurance that I can be fighting for xp and/or loot soon after.
Sure, it's easy to get out of Nexus quickly, and then you get to your
real destination and find it packed and your ride down has long since
gated away and...  Just isn't worth it for a hybrid unless you have a
group waiting for you, a pet porter, or (best case) a group including a
porter <with> you.
