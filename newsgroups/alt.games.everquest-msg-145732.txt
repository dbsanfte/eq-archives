    Bracers are good fillers if you get the STA, WIS, or INT ones. I'll
guarantee you there's a main that will wear it - it's good stats and resist
gear all rolled into one. The other bracers, well, grats peridot fund.

    Most arm slot items are pretty weak - maybe 30/30 HPs/MANA and minor
stats. Losing that usually isn't a horrible loss, and FT is FT. I wouldn't
wear one, but I'm fussy that way. ;-)

    Dunno what was up, but he was warping on top of the bard that was trying
to kite him away. Then, once he was pulled away, the kiter would run into a
bunch of caster mobs and get his naked ass whacked.

    We usually get one non-Master, then a Master and one add every two
pulls. That's a far cry from the stream of adds that Monual was seeing. The
tribal guys seem to be pretty clustered around the zone area, but in the
open area what few path by can be single-pulled and cleared as the puller
runs out. I pull them single for XP when we do Rumblecrush, and I don't have
Feign. ;-)

    That never works. Lots of tanks wait for heals to start on them before
taunting, disarming, and whatever other aggro-adding things they do. So you
assist and you get the nimble tank, or some poor caster, and start a crazy
cycle of re-assisting until you have the person you want. If you need a CH
chain on someone, and the first person to CH finds the target by assisting
the mob, that someone is likely gonna die.

    I've done it once with a sub-optimal group, and we'd finish clearing one
pillar just as the next one finished repopping. It's a fun place once you do
the break to actually start going around the area.
