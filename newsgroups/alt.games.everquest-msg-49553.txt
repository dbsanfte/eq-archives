The Wraith or placeholder wonders on the ledge around the tower you've
describe there (this is the third locked door, and has the final reaver
inside it).  It takes multiple groups to fight up there, but since you
don't have to kill anything inside the tower or the room, I bet just a few
people can hold the broken bridge and kill the ph.  I've seen that reaver
aggro through the door though, so a FD puller would be a good idea...
