Why do the online RPG's need a monthly payment to play? No other genre does
as far as I know. Yet some of the others must cost an awfull lot of money to
run (Diablo2 for instance). What I'm saying is, you've already payed for you
game so why do you have to pay again and again? You know where this will end
up don't you? You'll have to pay for every game/demo/patch and test you use.
