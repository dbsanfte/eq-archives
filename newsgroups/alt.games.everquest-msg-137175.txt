Maybe Cabilis is the place to meet moron monk beggars.  Last night on Tallon Zek
(as I was stripping my monk in preparation for a move to another server):

Lizaris is inspecting you.
Lizaris is inspecting you.
...

Lizaris tells you, "u got anything i can sell?  im a newbie been playing
only two weeks."

Lizaris is inspecting you.
Lizaris is inspecting you.
Lizaris is inspecting you.
Lizaris is inspecting you.

I tell him "no."

Lizaris moves around inspecting everyone.... then
comes back to me again.

Lizaris is inspecting you.
Lizaris is inspecting you.
Lizaris is inspecting you.

Lizaris tells you, "do you have anything for me, plz?"

Jesus... he's like level 8 or so and obviously has begged his
way into some really nice stuff already.

Sigh.  I guess begging works.

Just say no.
