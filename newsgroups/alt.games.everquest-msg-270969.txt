If you dig deeply enough into the online help, there's a note on the list of 
supported cards.  The GeForce4 MX chipsets are not supported.

I printed the list before going shopping.  I remember when the MX chipsets 
were about to hit the market, the DOOM3 developers were advising people to 
avoid them since they're really a step backwards, more like a GeForce2.

That little blurb on the box, DirectX 9.0 support, is the hitch.  The 
chipset supports 7.0 and some of 8.0.
