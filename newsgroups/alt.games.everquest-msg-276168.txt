Worse yet, do not run onto the boat.  I did that once and died on the 
boat.  Your corpse ends up at the bottom of the ocean at the spot where 
the boat zones out.  I ended up riding the boat a couple times to 
determine the location of the zone out, then swam out and go the corpse, 
was quite an adventure.  I did use a chipped bone rod to point me at the 
corpse even then, as it was still difficult to get the exact location.
