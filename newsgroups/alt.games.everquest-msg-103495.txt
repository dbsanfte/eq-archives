Do what I do.  Any time someone "thanks" me with TY, I promptly ask
them what TY means.

The thing that most of the PLZ apologists seem to miss in their
arguments that urgency requires abbreviation is that "please" and
"thank you" are almost invariably used in non-emergency situations.  I
can fully understand not using "please" / "thank you" when in the
middle of combat, and the use of other abbreviations to get the
message across; you're fighting for your life, after all.  But when
there's no urgency, then yes, they should be typed out in full.  If
you're not currently being beaten to death, then there's no reason for
using PLZ.  And if you *are* being beaten to death, then I fully
understand your not using any form of "please" as you are busy.

So, if in combat, "please" goes by the board, as it's understood
you're busy.  If not in combat, "please" gets used, because you're not
in imminent danger of dying, and politeness counts.  So when should
PLZ be used?  NEVER.

(Side note:  I type somewhere in excess of 40 WPM.  I find it amusing
that when someone who I care about levels, I can get off, say,
"Congratulations, lad" faster than others can get out "Congrats".)
