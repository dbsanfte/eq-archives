Thank goodness you are lvl 18 insead of 48.  But at 48 you would probably
know that thwe corpse has both a 'rez timer' and a 'loot timer'.  Not sure
the time on either, but I'm sure someone else can supply that info.  Anyway,
sometimes you can go to the bazaar and watch the wts(want to sell).  You
might even be able to bargain.  Or, if you're in a guild, beg their pity and
get new stuff from them.
