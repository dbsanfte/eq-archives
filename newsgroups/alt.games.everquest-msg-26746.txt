Personally I thought this was also an annoying feature of
Velious.  Snared mobs path really odd, and seem to keep
moving, even unsnared ones tend to (for lack of a better
term I will borrow this one from sailing) Tack.  As a rogue
I found this especially annoying.  I found the tizmaks did
it too, in GD, but only when outside, not in the caves. 
It's very hard to stay behind a mob and backstab it
succesfully when it keeps changing direction constantly as
it tries to run away.
