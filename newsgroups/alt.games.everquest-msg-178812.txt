You really need to farm HG at off peak times. Complete waste of time IMO
doing it at or near peak times. There is one good thing about having a
couple of uber people farming HG's thought.  They generally will also be
killing the numerous HG PH, spawning more giants more quickly.

Pull it to a safe spot before fearing. If you fight on the plateau expect
adds and death. Get sow pots or ask a druid there to sow you.

Sounds unlucky. I also used to loot absolutely everything, especially the
fine steel, but words runes etc too. Nip to merchant huts sell all the junk,
buy peridots untill all I had left was PP, then resell the dots. Allows you
to stay in RM for a lot longer before needing to go to a bank, tho you do
lose a bit converting all the copper-silver-gold.

Yes extremely mind numbingly dull. Most of the HG's were green so atleast I
could get a guildie with me who could just sit down and AFK  wherever I was
pulling to and get all the xp :)
