Its sold by most gem vendors - look at www.eqtraders.com under jewellery
supplies to find out where they are. Also, there are various vendors,
usually in caster guilds but also in places like a hut in EC, who sell a
selection of common spell components, malachite, cats eye agates,
peridots, batwings, fire beetle eyes, fish scales etc.

Malachite looks like a green blobby thing with a '1' in the corner,
since it's stackable.

I can't tell you exactly where to buy it since I don't know where you're
based.
