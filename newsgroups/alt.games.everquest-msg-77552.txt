Stuns will stop mobsin their tracks.  Once a cleric gets their 3rd stun,
chain stunning mobs is a piece of cake.  Then there's the symbol and shield
line of spells that reduce the damage taken by a tank.  The HP buffs will
add ungodly amounts of HPs that the tank has to begin with.  Also, clerics
can fear with the best of them,  The biggest problem is the lack of a snare
which is why the Cleric/Ranger combo, to me, is an excellent combination.
