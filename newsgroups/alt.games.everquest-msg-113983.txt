There I was in Oasis with my necro.  Sitting alone by the computer with the
shades drawn, lights off, Molson Ice riding shotgun....
I knew I was approaching level 17, but hadn't looked at my exp bar in a bit.
Killed off a dry bones skeleton, then it happened...

DIIIIIING!!!

Jesus, it knocked me clean out of my seat!  Tipped over my chair, spilled my
beer, wife comes running out from the bedroom wondering what the Hell that
noise was (me being ejected from my perch, that is).
I don't think I'll ever get used to that sound!  Why the Hell can't they
nerf the volume on that?  Christ, it's louder than every other friggin'
sound in the game!

Getting over it but fearing the next DING!,
Sean....
