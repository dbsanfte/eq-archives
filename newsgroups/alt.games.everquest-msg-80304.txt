Sorry guys, I did take care of this. Yes, I WAS at fault, and I let the GM
know that I knew I was. I apologized and he said it was cool. Now I only
have to find the other player in question to apologize to him. If he ever
lets me. In any event, as I have said about 119 times now, I WAS at fault.
But I also am trying to make it right. I know it was stupid, and I have no
excuse, so I won't even offer one. I'll only say that I'm going to try to
make amends to the player in question.

If you want to flame, firesuit on and ready to go ;)
