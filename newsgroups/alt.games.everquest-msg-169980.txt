That may be true, but I'm reasonably sure both Shaman and Necro could do
fine in MM. A warrior and a wizard however - not really a good team
anywhere, but I can see why they wouldn't do very well in MM.  

As a side I'm thinking with the way things are now at the lower levels
(and even some at the higer levels) a good duo can way outdo a group, or
solo (well my enchanter still solo's at 1+1/2 times any grouping or duo
on the xp side so far, the deaths take that down to nill if she can't
find a rez, just about every day though).  The setup, and dicking around
that happens really cuts into your killn' time, and when you've only got
a few hours a day that makes it even worse.

Hmm thanks for the info.  I'd go back, but right now I'm having a much
better time in MM.

There were usually one or two other people there, but they didn't want
to group.  I get up at about 7:30 AM PST and log on (weekdays).  Never
very many people until somewhere about 10-11:30 am, when I have to log
off and go to work.  Even at the peak times there were always fiends
available, but they green out before the bandits.
