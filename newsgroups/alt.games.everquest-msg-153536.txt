It occurs to me that the upcoming changes, if they go live
as announced, will make Wizards with Manaburn hugely
desirable for raids targetting high HP mobs.  If the modrod
nerf prevents (or makes very difficult) keeping your MT and
other melees alive indefinitely, then a Manaburn rotation
(interval determined by how long the new aftereffect stops
another Manaburn from landing) will extend the size (in HP)
of the mob your raiding force can kill.  Another likely effect
would be an increase in the value of healer usable FT items,
as well as relevent focus items (wonder if they'll remove the
CHeal exemption).
