My main is 41 ranger and I still use my SSOM (off hand) and SSOY in
the main hand (I know SSOM has a lower delay but I like the Ykesha
proc).

However, I don't know if one L30 char can take out the Ghoul
Messanger.  A group of two maybe.  I know I tried it at L31 and got my
ass handed to me on a plate.  By sheer luck when I was on my CR
someone shouted that they had killed the GM and they let me loot it. 
Sweet!.

To answer the original post - if you could stretch to 200pp (maybe
250) you could get a set of Icetooth Claws (11/29).  I used them from
L19 to 30.  They used to be more but they are very common now.  In my
off hand then I had a Sarnak Eitchatka (i.e. off hand claws) so I had
the Wolverine look :).
I got them in the Lake of Ill Omen at level 23 (They dropped from a
Sarnak Adherant and I won the roll).

With the upcoming changes to 2HS combat, it might be worth investing
in a Two-Handed practice sword.  I neglected my 2HS and 2HB skills and
at 41 I think it may be too late to try to get them maxed.  Ah well,
at least I have hit the caps on 1hs, 1hb, piercing and have archery
maxed :)
