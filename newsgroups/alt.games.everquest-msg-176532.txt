Another thing that is quite important that no one seems to mention is time!
I wish I had the time to get into a regulat D&D game, but between working
(even if I am posting here while supposed to be working), family and 100
other obligations EQ is a great way to be social, have fun and play when I
want. (or more realistically, when I can!)
