Which I only see as a good thing, these days.  There was a time when I
prided myself on setting the jumpers on my motherboard, and downloading the
best freeware to handle every little task, hell I even played with Linux for
a while.  Now days, I just reach for the PnP motherboard, slap Windows on
it, and pray it works (which is more likely than it used to be).  I've got
better things to do with my time, and Microsoft allows me to go ahead and do
them.  Hooray for bundling.

So, by tying, one of the competitors is providing a better service for less
money.  I though that was the point of competition.  If that's the state of
the market in your area, than some of those water and coffee companies had
best merge to stay competitive.

Nobody's being forced to do anything.  Nobody needs to be in the beta.

Dunno, I guess I'm just too free-market for this type of thing.
