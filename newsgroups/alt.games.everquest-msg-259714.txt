Well...

Cleric BP's were near and dear to my heart for a while.  Now that I have a
Time BP, of course, all sorts of cleric-useable BP's of equal or greater
value are dropping in Uqua+ zones.  =/

Before I finally got my Time BP, the Royal Attendant BP was the only BP that
seemed reasonably accessible.  I was saving up for one when I got my Time
BP.

If you have a family-style guild with a few 65's, you ought to be able to
farm the BoT towers and the HoHa trials for loot, and perhaps even get your
paws on an Ornate BP mold.  Right-clicky BoR is useful.  =)
