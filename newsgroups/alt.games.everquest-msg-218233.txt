There's a subtle difference between what I'm doing and a "straw
man".  In a straw man argument, you take a false or distorted 
argument and attack that instead of the real argument.  I'm doing
the reverse, eliminating all potential differences between your
position and mine except the one that I'm interested in.

I'm doing this not by distorting them or by falsifying your
position, but instead by agreeing completely with everything you
have to say with the single exception of the issue under
discussion.

When you tell me your position is NOT what I think it is (ie,
always pull at 30% mana minimum) I change to match that (ie, ok,
you pull at a varying mana level which may be lower or higher
than 30%;  we'll pull at 50% more mana than you whatever your
mana level is, instead)

So to demonstrate that my argument is a straw man, you must show
that I am not using your actual position.  The closer to my
position is to yours, the more you seem to object, but thats
precisely what I MUST do to avoid the straw man fallacy.

IF you state that your position is different enough from what I
think it is that my argument collapses, I may still not be wrong,
as I said much much earlier, its entirely possible that you agree
with me, and we just think we disagree.  So far, however, I don't
see that happening, its pretty clear that you really think that
staying relatively LOM is somehow actually superior to playing
the same way, only with more mana.  Thats the opposite of my
position on the matter... so its hard to see how we can be
agreeing.

Try again.

We play like you in every way EXCEPT for the one difference under
discussion.

Its like saying "my tuna sandwich is made with tuna, mayo, and
bread; your tuna sandwich with tuna, mayo, bread, and an
aardvark" is describing two identical sandwiches

Do you not see the aardvark?

AARDVARK:

Just like you (tuna sandwich) except starting with 50% more mana
(aardvark)

This concludes aardvark hour

Tune in tomorrow for exploding purple banana cream enema hour
