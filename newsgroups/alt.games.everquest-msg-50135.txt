Hi,

If you dont like what Biz has to say, Killfile him. Hell, I've
considered it a few times. But some of us (me in particular, true)
are interested in how FV is shaping up. Once the rush has died down
I may well move there, and find out for myself, but for now it helps
me evaluate whether giving up my live play server with 2 years
invested in a character is worth it; to find out whether FV will
really BE a roleplaying server.

When it comes down to it, in this case all Biz is doing is offering some 
insights and opinions as to how the server is panning out; you dont
have to agree with him, or even read them, but simply shouting "NANA
NANA I DONT LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I CANT HEAR YOU SHUT UP SHUT
UP SHUT UP" not only makes you look like a buffoon; it is intended to
deprive all of us of some much needed content in this group which
we might be interested in.

We're all able to decide what we want to read; you should be able
to do that to.

Go on. Kill file him. You know you want to. Hell, I want you to.
I'd rather remain able to read your posts myself on the off chance
you post something of relevance to Everquest in the EQ newsgroup.

Sui
