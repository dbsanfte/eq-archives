    First let me start off by saying that all the below is my opinion
only.  I have no special insights, and everyone of my guesses and
assumptions here could be wrong.  I don't particularily want EQLive to go
away, and I will go on record as saying that I think it will be around for
at least another five years, if not considerably longer.

   Ok, now that the disclaimer is done...

   I believe that sooner or later, EQLive is going to decline in player
base numbers to the point that SoE will make the call to start merging
servers.  I've seen several posts over the years here that lead to me think
that I'm not the only one.  So, given what we know now, with WoW, EQII, and
whatever else is certain to come down the pike, when do *you* think this is
going to start happening?

  Pick a day and year when you think that SoE will first announce a server
merge.  Please pick a unique day from everyone else, as the prize for being
right cannot be split (it's a reconditioned, flower painted VW van!  With a
working radio!).  I'll compile the list from time to time so everyone knows
where they stand on it.  

   I'll go first.  I say that the magic day will be a year and seven months
from the release of EQII.  And since we don't know for sure exactly when
that will be (things happen, you know) I'll go by the projected day of Nov
15th.  So I say that the first server merge will be announced on May 15th,
2006.  (Crosses fingers that math is right)

   I really hope I win cause I don't really have a VW Van to give away.
