I wouldn't dream of playing in a Zek server (when I feel psychotic, I 
play Myth III with my coworkers... unfortunately, I'm getting too old for 
Quake), I don't think something that drastic is required. Their original 
idea of allowing the Evil team to figth each other would nicely take care 
of it. I don't understand why they didn't implement that after proposing 
it.
