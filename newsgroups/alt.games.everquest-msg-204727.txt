Oh, and to see this effect at work, go to a zone where others are killing and there
are faction hits.  If you ever see a faction hit without a corresponding exp
message, you'll know someone else killed something that hated you.

This used to happen quite often in LOIO, where aggro is passed around like mad and
there were always dozens of groups killing things, it got to where I made it a rule
to camp out or log out any time I got one of those phantom faction hits because I'd
been hit by waves of Sarnaks too many times to ignore it.  What made it worse was
that due to the twisting nature of the fortress, a mob with me on its list could get
close enough to aggro, but have walls in the way that made it path off in the
opposite direction, running a course that brought it thru piles of friends who would
add on and all come barrelling down the corridor in my direction all at once.

Sadly, there's little by way of faction in POJ to give you this sort of warning.
