Dan,

  You've lost me here.  There should have been 5 questions regarding guilds
overall in the message you replied to, but, I'm seeing some very odd message
content in some of the replies, such as "rezes" and "porting."

  <shrug>  I think my message might have been chewed up or atleast somehow
crossed with another message. :)

  These are the questions that should have shown up in my original post
along with what you did reply to:

*******BEGINNING OF CUT********

    I won't bother kidding anyone by pretending as if Im not going to use
information from this thread in order to better the guild in which I am
currently leader of. :)  However, I'm really curious to know everyone's
opinion on the following:

1.  What traits do you look for in a guild?  (this is a broad question,
however, just point out the key traits, unless of course you wish to list
them all)

2.  What type of recruitment do you consider most favorable? (ie.
Invitations via tell to those non-guilded persons, open /ooc or /shout
advertisement/invitation, etc.)

3.  What do you feel is a guilds key to success?  (ie. member base [number
of])

4.  What type of services should a guild offer you the member?

5.  What features should the guild offer on their website?


    I've already asked members of our guild questions 2-5, however, as I
mentioned I would like to get the opinions of all of you, regardless of
guild, server, class or level.

    Those not wishing to reply via the group (of which is your parogative),
please dont hesitate to send a reply via email.

Sincerely,
Jacobson
