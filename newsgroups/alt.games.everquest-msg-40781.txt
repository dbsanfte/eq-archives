6 and up is the bigger time, straight from horses mouth (though I've
also heard of level 5's who had a corpse still... weird.):

"p.20: The bottom half of this page outlines corpse decay times based
upon level and login status. The times provided are incorrect. The
player-corpse decay times are as follows. Please note that all times
are in real time, not Norrathian time: 

Level 1 � 5: 30 minutes
Level 6+: 24 hours of online time, or 1 week of offline time (or some
combination of both). 


Empty corpses (with no items) have a different timer than those with
items:

Level 1 � 29: 3 minutes
Level 30+ : 3 hours (total, online or offline).

*Note: It is best advised to get your corpse right away. Also note
that when considering corpses that are not empty one-hour in game is
the same as seven hours out of game, and that the timer on a corpse
ticks down whether you are in game or not. If you have a level 12
corpse with items on it in the game and spend 12 hours playing and 3.5
days out of game, that corpse will be gone. Also, be advised that
leaving your computer at the character select screen or play on
another character on that same account counts as time in game as it
relates to the corpse decay timer.

"


Notice the 12 hours playing and 3.5 days out of game. In other words,
that 24 hours of online time is subtracting days every few hours or so
from that 1 week of offline time. The mix can screw you up and some
people think "oh i have 24 hours if online all at once so I'll play
for 12 hours and log in like in 5 days..." As they show the 12 hours
online will be half a week subtracted from the offline time.. ouch,
since that 24 hours is the same as 7 days. Somewhat confusing if you
are trying to keep track with some on and some offline time. 

As he suggests I have never logged off without a corpse, never in 54
levels of one char and several twinks. If you have to for work or
whatever I'd say get it as soon as you are done and back on. Never
leave a corpse and go on vacation or something.
