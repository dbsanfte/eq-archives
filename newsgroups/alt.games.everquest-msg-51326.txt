well on tholuxe paells we were one of the last servers to get this gm event
so most people knew it was coming. in there were at the high point 20+ all
sitting at millers farm waiting for it to happen so they could be in on it
and have a chance. the person who won it on TP was a person who sat there
for over 20 hours and when the event was on used her tracking skills to help
others with smudge sticks find an unlit brazier. she also roleplayed and
thanked the gm for holding such a well done event before getting the item in
her box. so being there in right place, how long she waitied. how helpful
she was how well she roleplayed (and kissed up to the gm lol) got her the
item IMO
