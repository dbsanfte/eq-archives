No. It is that the enemy with <nothing to lose> is the most dangerous. The
more you have to to lose, the more vulnerable you are to the boxcutter set.
What are you going to do? Kill them? Hello? Sesame street today is brought
to you by the term "assymetrical warfare"...

And yet still fail to comprehend why you shouldn't. That is what has both
friend and foe nervous.

You won't be able to stop there. Do that and the entire world and your own
people will be justly be against you because will be <become> the monster
that we already fear. The only way to remove terrorism is to remove hatred.

In other words, it can't be stopped, it can only be controlled, and not with
guns but with actions.

Arabs? Israel? You have the approval of a few overeager world leaders who
have not even had the chance to answer to their own constituents yet. Your
keeping your theatre of operations rather naively limited there aren't you
for a hawk?

You can't buy peace. Didn't Vietnam teach you hawks anything?

Yawn - the world already knows that during the process of the talks in
question, US special forces were at the very least "sitting back" watching
Afghani allies perform mass executions. No surprises there.
