No doubt there best solo spot for 45 is the 3 spawn camp of abitor giants in
FV....these gimpy bastard are easy to kill and get you through 45 in about 7
hours of play time....plus there loaded with loot....simply bind and the camp
and when you fill your packs up run to FV sell...i could not do since i was
"evil  troll...but i hired a runner who sold for me i made about 250pp per
trip..and came out with 3 forest loops....good luck
