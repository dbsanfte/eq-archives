->I'd like a new video card, but I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to go
->top of the line or go price vs performance. GeForce2/Radeon7200 seem great
->for under $100 !! Any suggestions?

-When it comes to price ATI offers some interesting choices. The older
-Radeon cards have been given new names. The Radeon VE (now called the
-Radeon 7000) does "NOT" support Hardware T&L. Avoid this card if at
-all possible. It is a crippled version of the original Radeon. The
-original Radeon 32DDR and 64 DDR are now called the Radeon 7200. The
-7200 cards are the same gereration as the GeForce2 GTS.

You left out the R7500, which also comes in OEM and full boxed flavors. 
It's a 64MB card, supposedly GF-3 level (like the 8500). 
The only 3d game I play is EQ, and this card is priced right for me.
