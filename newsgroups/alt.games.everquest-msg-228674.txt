Archerbear is right. Go with the INT and pump everything into it that 
you are allowed to. Later on in life, your wizard will care about one 
thing and one thing only... mana. It's your lifeblood. My sorcerer was 
well past the 3K unbuffed mana pool level by the time he was sixty and 
whether you are on a raid mob, or just soloing or in a group, there will 
be times you want every drop of mana you can squeeze out.

Hit points can be very nice in your first ten to twenty levels before 
wizards begin to come into their own, but that passes quickly. Later on 
in life, HP aren't going to matter to you. You're not going to be the 
one taking a beating from big mobs, and if you are, it will be 
mercifully short beating.

Then you go loot your corpse after your rez. ;-)

Go with the mana. This is your mantra.
