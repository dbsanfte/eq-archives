Can you imagine the xp that could be gained if your lowbie character could
just whack on high level NPC's, knowing that they can't/won't fight back?
Even if it is just for the skills, it is still an exploit that
inconveniences other players.

I could see if someone accidently hit the Soulbinder a time or two, that
he/she might be the forgiving sort... but after a few swings, when it's
obvious the attack is deliberate, a nice translocate somewhere inconvenient
might be appropriate.

I say after a few swings, because not everyone who attacks an NPC does so
deliberately.  A case in point is when my brother went to visit his beloved
Dwarven king for the first time as a newbie.  Humbly approaching his
majesty, he proceeded to type out, "H-a-i-l..."   This was before he knew to
re-map his auto-attack key........my brother was turned into a grease spot
within moments after hitting the 'a' key.

To make it so anyone who attacks a Soulbinder is instantly
translocated/bound someplace nasty would be unjust for the innocent newbies
and the occasionally careless or accident-prone veteran.  Make it so the
Soulbinder does that after reaching, say, half hit points....that would make
the surprise even nastier for the exploiters....
