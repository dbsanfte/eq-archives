> Erudite Shadow Knight?

    not having played any other class extensively (i have a 41 human sk) i
cant really judge but based on the math and my experiences shadowknights
certainly are difficult to play, if lots of fun when you work it out. They
seem to be about adding together lots of tiny advantages to hold your own
against another class.

    Of course around about level 54 the advantages stop being so tiny, and
by 65 they're a little on the terrifying side. An erudite SK would be even
harder to play than a human one until the SK spells start to really kick ass
in the higher levels :)
