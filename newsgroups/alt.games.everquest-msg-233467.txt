No, you don't lose XP.  You just take longer to get your reward.

Let's take a simple case, using entirely made-up numbers, to illustrate
this.  Suppose you are a certain level of XP.  Your goal is to ding, and to
get one AA.  Suppose it will take 1000 XP to get the AA, and 3000 XP to
ding.

This means that to reach that goal, you have to earn a total of 4000 XP.
Let's first consider going 100% AA, then 100% regular.  Your future looks
like this:

        earn 1000 XP, get AA point, switch to 100% regular
        earn 3000 XP, ding

Now let's do a 50/50 split.  Your future is:

        earn 2000 XP, get AA point, switch to 100% regular
        earn 2000 XP, ding

Notice that you reach your goal (ding with an AA) in the same time as with
the 100/0 initial split.  The only difference is that by going 50/50, you
take twice as long to get the AA.

Same goes for other splits.  Let's do a 25% AA split:

        earn 4000 XP, get AA and ding at the same time

The above is assuming that the AA doesn't do something to help you earn XP.
If you are going to spend the AA on something that will make you earn XP
faster, then the first case, where you get the AA after 1000 points and can
benefit from it while earning the 3000 to ding, will take less time than the
other cases.

There's also this possibility for our goal of one ding, one AA: go 100% XP
first.

        earn 3000 XP, ding and switch to 100 % AA
        earn 1000 XP, get AA point

If dinging will give you some new spell or ability that will let you get XP
faster, then this order might save you time.

The general point is if you have a set of level and AA goals, and list them
in the order you want to reach them, then in general you are best off going
100% in the kind of XP necessary to reach your *next* goal.  Anything else
simply puts off reaching that goal, without speeding up reaching the
subsequent goals.
