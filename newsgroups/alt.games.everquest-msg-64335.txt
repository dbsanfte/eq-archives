WEll i can deffinately realte to not being impressed with the technology
side of ths. In addition I must admit that I am not really impressed with
the implementation of the new patch either. I am having the same problem. I
have gotten through about half of the .exe and then it just hangs... A
couple of times it wouldnt even get to half... just the first blue line and
taht was it. Think maybe it would be safer to try this on Friday. Then
again... maybe not. And yes i know in advance that I am going to get flamed
for this post. /e shrugz. What can you expect when there is no age or mental
competency requirement?
