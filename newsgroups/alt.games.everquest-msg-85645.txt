Whoa. That's disturbing.

Even if the other, contradictory, statement (Legends-specific stuff 
won't go back with you if you drop Legends), is correct, there are 
some issues they need to address.

For instance: the existing character transfer policy dictates
that when you transfer a character to a new server, that character's 
gear and cash doesn't go with it. Legends just opened up a bit fat 
loophole there, except for nodrop gear.

* Uber Char A wants to go from server A to server B.
* Char A rolls up an alt, Char B, and passes droppable gear 
  and pp to Char B.
* Char A gets transferred naked to server B.
* Player subscribes to Legends, moves both Char A and Char B to Legends.
* Char B passes the gear and pp over to Char A.
* Player drops Legends. Voila, Char A goes back to server B
  with all his droppable gear and cash from server A.
