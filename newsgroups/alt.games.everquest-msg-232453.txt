I'm coming up on buying my second LDoN silk piece with Type 1, 2, and 3
slots and realize that I'm confused about adding augs.  My big question is
whether augs have to put on in order.  On my first piece, I put an FT2 item
into slot 3, then a +Int aug on that went to slot one.  If I then want to
put another aug into slot2, will the aug in slot1 "block" it and have to be
removed?  My question is basically the same for the new piece of equipment.
I'd like to eventually put a FT2 aug in Slot 3, but right now only have a
+Int aug for it.  I'm assuming that the +Int aug will go to slot 1 (good
assumption?).  When I'm ready to put the FT aug on it, will I have to remove
the +Int aug to "unblock" the path to slot 3? TIA.
