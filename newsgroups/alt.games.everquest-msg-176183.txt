I wouldn't put Rangers in there with the knights, especially post-40.
Yes, they can tank.  But they have fewer HP than the knights, they
have a lower Defense cap, and as a chain class their armor doesn't
count for as much as the true plate class tanks (WAR/PAL/SHD), all of
which means that they need significantly better gear to tank as well
as a same level knight.  If you want to be a damage dealer, on the
other hand, high level Rangers are way beyond the knights (Paladin in
particular, Shadowknight gets ATK buffs and DoTs which lift it above
Paladin in that area).
