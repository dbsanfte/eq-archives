Well, let's try calculating it.  If your average hit is for 1.5x base
dmg plus bonus then the Wurm works out to (25*1.5+6)/40 = 43.5/40 =
1.0875 dmg/dly at L45.  A Jade Mace (9/18 better than those I mentioned
in my previous post) would work out to (9*1.5+6)/18 = 19.5/18 = 1.0833
dmg/dly at L45, so the Wurm has only a tiny edge with the 1.5x average
hit presumed.  Now that 1.5x is very close to what I observed for my
Paladin in his mid-40s, but my Paladin is a Half-Elf with an 80 base
STR.  A Barbarian Warrior is gonna be substantially stronger and have
higher Offense skill plus higher weapon skill, all of which boost your
damage somewhat, and so he's gonna have more like a 1.6x or 1.7x avg.
multiplier, which will favor the Wurm more:  (25*1.7+6)/40 = 48.5/40 -
1.2125 vs. (9*1.7+6)/18 = 21.3/18 = 1.1833.  That's only about a 2.5%
edge for the Wurm, probably doesn't matter nearly as much as losing
agro just once at a bad time would, heh.  So, from that I'd say that
by mid-40s a Warrior probably would be better off with a decent fast
weapon than the Wurm, except while solo (when he'd be better still with
a decent 2-hander).  On my server Jade Mace's are 2.5kish, about same
as the (overvalued, IMO) Centi LS, looks like the OP would be well
served to try to get one sometime in the next 5 to 7 levels (or even
right now, if he's let his 1hb skill fall behind).
