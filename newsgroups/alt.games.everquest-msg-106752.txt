I agree ... kinda...
On the other hand,  I was in LOIO the other day and there were 3 guys there,
level 12 and 13.  They had no idea how to use /LOC.  They had no "sense
heading" to speak of.  One of them didn't know where he was BOUND for cryin out
loud.  
They weren't iksars.  
(Of course they were begging for a port out.)
I'm just wondering:  for a true NEWBIE, is this a good thing or not?  If they
don't learn how to do a corpse run when they are level 1 - 5 when they have
NOTHING TO LOSE they are sure going to be sad when they lose the gear they HAVE
earned at level 11.
