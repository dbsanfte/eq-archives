They could put code in it that you would have a limited time to attack
a KoS PC that is in your aggro radius. After that time you would get a
charm like state and start attacking. You would be free to continue
attacking, but if you stopped the timer would restart. Cooperation
with PC could be harder.

As far as cooperation with other MOBs, thats what it is all about
isn't it? Just think of camping the gates of Neriak or Grobb with a
party of Shadowmen.

Or, attacking the docks of Oasis with Spectres, uh, nm that happens
all the time...
