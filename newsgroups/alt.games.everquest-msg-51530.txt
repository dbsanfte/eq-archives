I'd say probably SK myself, but thats not based on much other than
personal/guild experience. I've got a good friend that has a 33 Erudite SK
and can still solo experience giving mobs relatively well.

Heh, and for that matter, SK's are mighty tough in a duel. I don't duel
much, but on a lark we decided to give it a try at level 30 between the SK
and my 30 human Monk. It was a complete route, with the monk having his ass
handed to him so fast it wasn't funny. With the monks naturally low magic
resistance, fear caught EVERY time, and it was a simple matter for him to
fear and lifetap me down, while I was slowed by darkness so he and his pet
could fear kite me around Toxxulia forest.

At the end of the fight he was at 85% health and had never even had to use
HT... embarrasing. It only takes a couple of times experiencing something
like that to realise just how unbalanced the classes are in EQ, at least in
certain conditions. On the other hand, the next time I offered to duel him
was when we were both naked and weaponless on a corpse run... he declined =)
