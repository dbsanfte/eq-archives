I think of winning in Everquest when you've pretty much done and seen
it all, or enough to know that getting to that last big mob will seem
pretty much the same as killing a dragon like Gorenaire did a while
ago. I have a 55 druid and already feel pretty much like I've "won." I
mean except for Luclin and sleeper's tomb I've pretty much seen it
all. I could get to 60 and maybe get full skyshrine armor on the way
but its almost like going through the motions, I already know I can,
its not new or exciting.. etc.

One other poster made a comment that when play Ad and D or boot hill
his parents would say "did you win?" when he came home, as if they had
a way to win or an ending. However, there is one very large difference
between such games and EQ: 

the content can change as often and be as original as the GM wants it
to be.

EQ can't do that. Velious is new at first but like 4 months later it
is old had already. You don't get the staying power. I know that if I
log on tonight the frost giants in Eastern wastes will not have
suddenly erected huge fortress there complete with some quests from
them and the dwarves in the area and that it won't be there next week.
Even the sickness in the karana's is not like that.. instead it
happens one night when you log in after a patch but when its still
that way after 6 months it gets kind of old. 

So I guess to me winning is when you've seen/done pretty much all of
it that you'd want to see and do.
