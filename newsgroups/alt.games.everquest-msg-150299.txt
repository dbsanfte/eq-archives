You're talking apples and oranges.

An awful <insert class here> is visible.  The wizard is drawing
aggro or sitting out fights, the mage has his pet on the wrong
mob, the druid isn't snaring, whatever, you can *tell* that
they're awful.

A 'great' rogue, always behind the mob, always doing his part,
never holds aggro, etc can still be pick-pocketing half the
mob's coin and a ton of non-magic loot and you'd never know
if you don't know the average drop rate for those mobs and
aren't keeping track via a master-loot system.

A rogue can skim half the coin drop for a night without ever
letting anyone know or doing anything else that anyone would
ever consider improper play for the class.

If you kill 100 mobs in a night that drop 3pp each, that's 300pp.
The rogue can walk away with 150pp *without you knowing* and
you get, after split even with the rogue disbanding first "because
he doesn't care about coin" 30pp.

You go ahead and "let them prove themselves."  A rogue's pickpocket
skill isn't visible to the group unless they're an idiot.  I'd
prefer not to take the chance, myself.  One night in Rathe Mts
killing hill giants, that 'great' rogue may walk away with 500pp
while you get 100pp.  And you'd *never* know...
