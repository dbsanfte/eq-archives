Well, I am certainly not one of GW's strongest supporters, and 
personally didn't vote for him.  But, in hindsight, I am very grateful 
that he is now pres. instead of Gore.  I personally don't think Gore 
would have handled this situation too gracefully (to put it kindly.  
hehe)  But, I do support GW's handling thus far since 9-11 (although I 
think it ridiculous that Ari Fleisher tried to pin the Isreal/Palistine 
issue on Clinton).  And as far as the prison camp goes, it is a lot 
better than the enemy has treated it's prisoners (um....execution 
anybody???)  I feel they have been treated fairly, and since they don't 
qualify for the Geneva Conventions concerning POW's, they aren't 
entitled to POW priviledges.  And if they want to starve (although at 
last count only 3 were still fasting) because they can't wear a turban 
(which I agree could be used to conceal a weapon) then that is their own 
fault.  But you non-US bleeding hearts can whine all you would like.  
Maybe next time then can fly a plane into the Eiffle tower or the Royal 
palace or some other "great monument" of your country and let's see if 
your views change then.
