I just bought the EQ Triology and had just a few questions.  I am very
interested in the ShadowKnight class but I noticed the character creation
screen said this was a difficult class to play.  I am really excited about
EQ so I dont want to overwelm myself with a hard, complex class to start
off, is the ShadowKnight really difficult to play?  Will I be able to play
solo with a shadowknight (keep in mind I wont know how to do any of the
advanced tactics like most)?  I basically want to play a fun class thats
mostly melee with some spells and I need to be able to play solo for awhile
as I have no friends in EQ (yet?).  Now one last question (sorry, I'm
exicted here, hehe), I think this Firiona Vie server sounds like loads of
fun, is this too much for a newbie?  If so, could anyone tell me what is the
newest non split server?  Thanks so much and if you have any wisdom to pass
on, I am all ears!

Thanks
