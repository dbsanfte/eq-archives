: Bah. The experience that made me instantly addicted to EQ was being lost

: the very day of release, and EC *was* dangerous.

For me it was the Barbarian Shaman blind as a bat trying to make it through
the tunnel into Black Burrow and getting smacked by the gnolls hiding in the
dark (those bastards have fealt my revenge every time I am around there).
And grouping is what really helped me get into the game, learning from those
that had been playing for the few months the game had been out before I
started.
