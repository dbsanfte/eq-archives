OT is fine but the shuttles have been a trainwreck for quite a long
time now. Perhaps they are better though, haven't used them in a
couple months.

Just be glad you weren't a guide when they tried to fix the boats a
year or something ago and completely broke them for a couple weekends
(IIRC they tried twice). We had to summon anyone who asked and
somebody was always on station just to do summons for several days
straight. That was painful, especially since plenty of people ignore
the MOTD and would be in a bad mood because they had been sitting and
waiting for an hour.
