There are many that are in that catagory.  Of course, verant could help a
bit by making outdoor raids, along the lines of Gornare (sp?).

And tanks being Meetshields, and clerics being healing and rez whores.... oh
wait.  Everyone's got their roles to play.  That druids don't have one is
their price for being so easily soloable.

Personally, I tend to perefer soloing, but that's because of my work
schedule.

So, you don't take advantage of one of the major benefits of your class, and
that's supposed to justify your wanting to unbalance things?  I could wear
nothing but leather armor, and complain about a Paladin's pathetic AC, but
it would be my fault, wouldn't it?

If you're not going to quad kite, why not play a shaman or a ranger?  Is it
just so that you can be relegated to a taxi service?  You're not matching
your playing style to your class, and you're demanding that your class be
changed to match your style.  Sorry, but that's one of the drawbacks to
playing a druid, and I think it's quite heavily overshadowed by the
benefits.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
