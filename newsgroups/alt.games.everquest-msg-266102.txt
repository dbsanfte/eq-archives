No they think -persistent- harrassment is a problem. They've drawn a 
line in the sand that says they'll tolerate a certain level of 
harrassment before they'll take punitive actions.

I've snipped it because it has no bearing on the conversation. We aren't 
defining harrassment, we're definng kill stealing. The only bearing 
harrasment has on the conversation, is that amongst the many other forms 
of harrassment possible in CoH, the activity that players call 
Killstealing is  one of them. That you can list other forms harrassment 
is really irrelevant.

Good thing that's not what this is about then.

Now your starting to get it. I -am- insisting that when a customer 
complains about something, that it be dealt with more professionaly.

If Powerleveling using technique X isn't against the rules, but enough 
people complain that its unfair, unbalancing, and is ruining their 
enjoyment of the game then CoH will probably address it. Of course, for 
them to -know- that its become a widespread problem they would have to 
keep track of how often players are complaining about it. So telling 
players that its not against the rules and disregarding all complaints 
on the subject isn't very constructive.

We've pretty much run this one to death. Its you that is insisting a 
particular definition is the -only- correct one. Its me that is 
insisting (and have already demonstrated) that a broader definition then 
the very narrow one you'd like to use is in use by the playerbase in 
CoH.

ROFL. What are you saying? That kill stealing -is- an epidemic problem 
bothing massive amounts of people, that people would be complaining 
about in huge numbers? But instead because its not strictly against the 
CoH rules, they're largely keeping quiet about it.

Perhaps they could solve all their other problems by just changing to 
the rules to allow it, and then people would stop complaining. I'm sure 
even you realize this is ridiculous.

Actually I provided proof. But don't let that stop you. You're on a 
roll.

How many non-customers do you really think are making a lot of 
complaints?

I think the folks at CoH are doing a fine job overall. I even think the 
rules are fine overall. CS is a little bureaucratic and clueless, and 
that could use improvement. 

I'm pretty sure they could manage it without bankrupting the game too.
