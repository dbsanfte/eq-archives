Well, you have five more levels until you get dual wield. You could look 
for a good deal on a better weapon. Make sure you have a fletching kit and 
other bare necessities of course. Beyond that, if you're just itching to 
spend it, I would look for an armor upgrade which would provide you with 
the greatest stat increases.
