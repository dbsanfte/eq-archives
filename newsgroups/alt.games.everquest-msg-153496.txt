On Tue, 08 Oct 2002 23:17:27 -0300, Trev <tsmith1@tru.eastlink.ca> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Everyone surprised MB is feeling the nerfstick raise your hands.


>Complete Heal is being reduced to a 7500 hitpoint heal. 

I wonder what caused this? Even the best equipped tanks didn't get
much over this.

THIS is going to be the one that really hurts.

I never noticed a problem.
