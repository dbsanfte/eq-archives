    I could never afford to buy veksar stuff in the bazaar... we dungeon
crawled all mine - except the helm that was a gift.

    The mask drops of a REALLY irritatingly uncommon spawn (is a placeholder
more often than synthrax's spawnpoint is) and the named can either drop the
mask or a slightly less cool neck piece. It's probably never in the bazaar
because people camping nobles still want it for themselves.

    By the far the *most* annoying piece is the boots though, the slave camp
is very slow experience for a bunch of 65's and has a lot of bad, bad
habits. You're also limited to one or two nameds while you're there, just
from the sheer quantity of mobs you're buried under.

    Well, it makes sense to me to get tanking AA's before stamina, but it's
going to take me a hugely long time to cap it without spending those last 11
points on it... we'll see, many many AA's to spend before im at that stage.
Maybe my guild will be seriously raiding by then.

    I'm kinda pissed at tradeskills atm. I *did* enjoy doing them once upon
a time but every time I put a major effort into one the bottom seems to drop
out of the market when im 3 points away from my goal <g>

    Thanks for that advice I might have to think about that one, and I've
got a friend who hates tradeskills who's been thinking about it... so ill
pass on your words to him.

    Hmm that is a nice helm and the effect would help - although if im
wearing my gear and am not buffed at all my neckpiece is a lightsource in a
pinch.
