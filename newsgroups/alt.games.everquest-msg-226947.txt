"Dont blame the clerics when you die, you just dont have enough hit points!"

Thats a quote I remember reading somwhere or other. I have always felt that
when things go wrong its a problem with the group. With people getting aggro
when they shouldnt, people not using thier abilitys to full potential, or
people just not paying attention. People die and some things just go awry
theres no escaping that. The guy got a rez and you completed mission so to
me thats a success story. As you get more time in deaths start to matter
less, especially when you get your epic.
