Hi,

if you are familar with Great Divide maybe try Eastern Wastes ?

Try to hunt the Ulthorks and Rygorrs. Great exp and especially loot (many
research components for your chanter and money). The next thing to say is
that the hunters and warriors dont hit hard for their level so less downtime
.... and as you will have many different mobs there too it wont get boring
=) If you might wnat to bring up tradeskills a bit too, here is a great
place to collect intregients (mainly used in shawl-quests).

Hope you will have fun =)

Christian
