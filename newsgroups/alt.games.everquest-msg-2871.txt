Hey, assholes self destruct. After spending most of his time in jail,
he will go back to UO. Don't you wish the L33t had a tag above them so
you could tell who to avoid grouping with? In a way, this becomes it.

allyourbasearemine says "Hey, want to join up to hunt tigers?"

Hmm, I guess I read it differently than you. Only the perticipants in
a Pk fight can report, and the one who initiated the combat cannot. So
if you pick on 3 people, win or lose, then you go to jail. You try to
get a bunch of buddies to report you, and you realize that you are all
a bunch of morons when the guide dropps you all in jail for a bit..
assuming the guide has the ability to do so.
