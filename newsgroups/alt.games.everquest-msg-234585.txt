I think it has to be in the ammo slot. I have a ceramic totem of the wrathe
in my ranged, been charmed a few times now and never had any problems with
it.

Also, I think it needs to be a weapon that was meant to be thrown in the
first place. like even if I  hit ranged attack I wouldnt lose my totem.
