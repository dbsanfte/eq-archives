But they aren't. The complaints are about people using "thx" and
"plz". I would personally differentiate between beggars (scum of
Norrath... burn them burn them) and buff beggars. Mainly because *I*
am an occasional buff beggar, yet I would never dream of lowering
myself to begging for cash.

When I refer to myself to a buff beggar I mean "Excuse me, hardy
adventurer, might you be able to spare the mana for..." which is
in-character and allowable within the constraints I set for my
characters :)
