I started in the orc group at Highpass as just over LV15 (less than a
bubble).  First night I got up to 16 (had a few deaths).  This past session
(about 3 hours total of good grouping), I went from 1 bubble into 16, up to
1 bubble into 18.
    According to my log parser, tonight only I have 308 + faction hits for
Highpass guards, putting me into Dubious.  I was keeping track, and after
about 150 faction increases, I went from scowls to threateningly.  After
another 250 (at about 400 total), I got to dubious.  Now after 548 from
orcs, and another 22 increases from turning in scalps, 570 total increases
(not sure if both are weighted evenly or not), I'm still dubious.  How much
do I need to have gotten to apprehensive?  Though I'm kicking myself for not
looting my share of bronze and ringmale because you can't sell to merchants
as dubious, then finding out the 2 closest merchants are on that
universal/hard to screw up/almost always indifferent faction (the ones
selling the food with the oven by then).
