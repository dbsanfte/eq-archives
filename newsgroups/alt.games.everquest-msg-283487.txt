First off - no LDoN, no Nexus, no cats, no BL's, no berserkers, no
lizards to start AFAICT.  

With all the newbie armor they added since launch, things may not favor 
the equipment independent classes (mages, necros) as much as they did at 
release.

Also, remember that alot of the things we endured in early release
will still be gone (spellbook during medding, random level pet summons,
waiting 4 levels to get your spells).  As a result, a lot of mages
think that that will be *the* power class - at level 8 IIRC you get
a guaranteed level 9 pet - pretty potent.  Although, you can no 
longer buy research levels with training points, so that may be
interesting.

I have just about decided to come back for this - I've cleared the space
on my HD and will likely reinstall this week on both my machines.

Now I just have to decide what 2 classes I most want to try duoing.
