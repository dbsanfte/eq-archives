Yep.Which means for max damage, I'll have to go with the BAL in the
offhand.  However, since I was unable to figure out how to hack the
weapons files in Copeland's analyzer, and the program doesn't have most
of these, I still have no idea if the KK is going to do me better in the
primary hand, or if I should put the Icetooth claw there, and put the KK
in the offhand, or just shove the bastard in it's scabard and give it to
some younger warrior in the guild.
