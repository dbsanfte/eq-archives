Note that in both EQ2 and WoW, you can generally cast while in melee.  You
can get interrupted in EQ2, like in EQ1, but it is much less likely than in
EQ1.  So, if the healer gets aggro, he can still keep right on healing
himself and others, while the tanks or CC people get things under control.

This considerably reduces the complexity of group combat compared to EQ1 or
DAoC.

Not quite all mobs.  There are some places where they don't want you to be
able to use ghost form to explore, so they have mobs that see and attack
ghosts.
