I'm not having any problems with 21.81 det4's on a P1.7Gig, 512MB RAM,
Geforce3.  The only problems I ever had with detonators in EQ took me a
while to track down - basically I can't use the antialiasing options without
weird things happening in game (flashing borders looking at spell book,
mouse pointer disappearing from last 3 inches of view, etc, etc) so I just
now leave antialiasing off and have never had problems since.  You may want
to try this and see if it helps, though its a long shot.
