Well, as an Enchanter, if you stand up and try to attack a critter,
I'd disband you from my group.
 So, simply put, Yes, casters do give up combat. Med and cast
depending on your class and role. For you, crowd control and aggro
management are your first concern. Never running out of mana is your
second concern.
If, for some odd reason you were full mana at the end of the pull and
wanted to build defense, I would allow you to mez the last one to piss
it off at you, then melee it for a bit. This is only if the entire
group agrees ahead of time, of course.
