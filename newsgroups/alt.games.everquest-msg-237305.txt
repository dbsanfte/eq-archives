  Tuesday night, Adastraea's guild, After Hours, had a Plane of Fear raid
scheduled...for 4:30 am. Way too late for me. I stayed up too late as it
was, doing a couple of LDoNs. But I left them to do the Fear raid without
Ada.

  Wednesday, I log on to find the Fear raid was a disaster. Presumably,
then, I didn't miss anything; I will have another chance at the Broken
Golem. I do some skill work before logging for work.

  Wednesday night, I log on to find one of our other wizards, Ecnegilletni,
is in Fear. He's observing Essence of Darkness raid the place; he is
stationed where he can keep an eye on the Broken Golem's spot. He suddenly
reports it pops, just now! I head to the Fear portal and wait.
  Guild leader Sorladar shows up. After Ecn reports EoD has engaged CT, he
goes into Hard-Assed Leader mode and issues the call: drop what you're
doing, finish your LDoNs, and get your butts to the Fear portal. We form up,
me in Fear as an observer, though uI probably should have ported back to PoK
and gone back to the portal myself; I forget where the zone-out is.
  Eventually, EoD decides they can't handle Cazic Thule, and call it for the
night. AH then goes in, straight to BG. But alas, Ecn has one part of his
epic already, and Sorladar says he will get the BG encounter this time;
another Fear raid is scheduled for 11pm Saturday, a time convenient to me.
So I will wait. Ecn gets his epic drop, and I log.

  Thursday, I do laundry, and not much of consequence on EQ. That night, I
log on, ready to help the guild. I do a /who all guild...

  "You are not in a guild."

  Ugh. Dread fills me; what have I done wrong? I change to an outside camera
angle; sure enought, Ada has no guild tag anymore. She is a free agent.

  Okay, then, let's get an explanation. /who all After Hours..."There are no
players on Everquest matching those who filters." It seems unlikely that no
one would be online, so I check for some known members. There are a few in
the Plane of Innovation. I head there.
  They don't have guild tages, either. They direct me to a chat channel,
where it is revealed that After hours is, as they put it, "re-forming to be
better". I suspect Sorladar got tired of running a guild, or there was a
revolt against his leadership, or something, but no one will give me any
details. They are waiting for a GM to approve their new guild. Meanwile,
they play on.

  So will I. Now that I am a free agent again, I am beholden to no one, and
can work on Neuveniu and Tosev. I may join the new guild. I may join
another; I hear Knights of the Green Order is getting huge, over 300 members
(no required raids). I will likely be unguilded for a while working on other
characters, but I do want the companionship of guild life for some things.
