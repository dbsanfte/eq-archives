Baking can be a very profitable skill. A new level 3 charachter can get
baking to 125 in about 2 hours.
That then allows you to makefiskcakes which you can sell to vendors and make
about 60 plat an hour which is pretty good for a level 3.
Its very boring though, youre better off spending the time leveling and
worrying about money at later levels when you need it but have it.
