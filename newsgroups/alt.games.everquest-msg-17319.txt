They are all on allakhazam's under Thurgadin.

Frost giant toes is first, giant heads second and feeding the coldain third.

Fourth quest is Saving Tanik

Fifth is Silken Prayer Shawl

Sixth is Embroidered Prayer Shawl

Seventh (and currently last) is Runed Prayer Shawl


Depending on your class and level, some of the shawls are quite nice - the
7th shawl has Flowing Thought I as an effect, which while minor is nice to
have if you spend a lot of time soloing I guess.

However, the quests are not really in the same vein as the Ring quests for
melees (except maybe the 4th one). Mostly, they involve a whole lot of
farming and raising trade skills to high levels - you can solo them up to
the 6th one depending on class/level if you don't mind the tedium. You might
be able to solo the 7th too, but that involves some No Drop items from
Sirens' Grotto, ugh.

If you get as far as finishing the 7th one, you'll probably be a master
baker, brewer, tailor, smith (not directly used but required for high-level
tailoring), fletcher, jeweller, potter and probably fisher. If you aren't
already a master of several trades, figure on spending about as much time
(and a few Kpp) on raising skills as you do doing the quests.

Still working on number 5 myself (and trying to convince guildies to spend
all their time in Velks gathering threads for me :) ).
