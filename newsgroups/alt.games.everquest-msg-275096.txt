Regarding this change, I am certain it does come from listening to the 
community.  No longer will I be force to pay exorbitant prices for the 
privilege of advancing my Sagecraft.  Alchemists can still make the melee 
equivalent of what I can make as a Sage, they just do not get the added 
benefit of being the only ones able to make inks and washes and such.  As 
a sage, I expect to lose the sole ability to make patterns, and, quite 
frankly, it will not bother me in the least, as I will no longer be the 
one who is slowing down my guildies from advancing their tailoring and 
armormaking.

What you see as ruin, I see as making things fairer.  I already have two 
tradeskills covered, and was contemplating making an alchemist in 
addition just so that I could actually get the items I needed without 
having to pay so much for them that I could never make a profit selling 
the resulting items, or having to wait on a poor overburdened friend to 
make them for me.
