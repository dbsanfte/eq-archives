Another point on this is that some items get you more tribute than others.
Hardened Chaink Links get you 19k for example, and can go for as low as 4k
or so in bazaar.  Thunderous Drums of Karana go for about the same if you
camp BoT, and Architects Bejewelled Breatplates get you up near 25k tribute
points.

For me, i just but a spare set of hardened link legs and dump em in a shared
bank slot, and hand em in when my tribute gets under 5k or so.  See them
often enough that its a 5 to 1 return on the investment.  Tradeskill items
(ie racial armor) gets you a lot of trib points as well.

Overall I'd say its not worth worrying about until 60+, but from that point
a few of the buffs available are handy - an extra 150HP, or FT5, or regen
10, etc etc.  Or for bards, having level 1 of wind instruments for CR's so
they can invis wihtout a flute as a simple example.

Really only worth it though if your in the position to be able to blow 4-8k
on an item for the tribute pts.
