The Gargoyle guards in skyshrine drop eyes, some stackable some not.

boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp
no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant
companion of your walks."
