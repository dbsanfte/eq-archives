And soloed there, and not died much? You are Qeynos I presume ;) ?
Have you fully explored Nek and soloed there? The fact remains there
is an on-the-rails aspect to EQ2 that does not exist in EQ, DAoC or
WoW. It is not a wide-open free ranging world like these games. Very
many folks feel this way too....I still read the EQ2 forums. I may
well return to EQ2 at some point if some of my grievances with the
game have been addressed. I have nothing against it and there is much
good about it.

I knew they were doing this, I hadn't realised how far they have taken
it. Is it the same in dungeons and mid/higher zones?

I can't agree here. This is a much banded rumour about WoW. Yes
leveling is very fast at the start. In fact levels 1 to 20 are *meant*
to be a long tutorial, transparent to the player, and this works very
well indeed. Once you hit mid to high thirties though leveling slows
way down unless you are a power gamer, grinder etc. spending
ridiculous hours playing.  If you are an ordinary player you will
certainly not reach near the level cap after a couple of months.
Especially not if you are following the story line, doing quests and
dungeons, gaining faction, crafting etc. Even when you do max out
there are the high level dungeons and instances, lots of them and the
defending/raiding aspect. Oh and the honour system, battlegrounds etc.
with more in development. 

And another myth; I have *never* had to wait in line to play. This may
have happened at launch, yes. What MOG launch goes really smoothly?
This may also happen only if you are stupid enough to create your new
characters on a server marked as heavy/maxed but there are plenty of
servers with lower populations. I have never, ever had to wait to
play. 

I'm amazed I'm defending WoW so much. I  really am no fan boy for
*any* game as I realise there are lots of different tastes to cater
for. I actually held off trying WoW myself until over six weeks after
its release because of the rumours I'd heard. When I actually
installed it and got down to playing though I was *amazed* at how much
bullsh*t had been thrown at it by fans of other games. 

Again I stress I am no WoW fan boy, far from it, I just don't like to
hear these inaccuracies fly around from folks who most likely either
have never played the game or are the manic grinder types for whom
getting to max as quickly as possible and being uber is all. It's not
about getting there....It's about the journey :).

The fact remains that the original poster wanted a game where he could
explore freely and solo well whilst doing so and not getting killed
too much. Given this I cannot see how EQ2 can be recommended over WoW.
I am *not* in any way saying WoW is a better game than EQ2 or any
other, I'm simply stating that in my opinion WoW meets the desires of
the original poster more than EQ2 does. Just the way I see it based on
many years of playing MMORPGs.

And I really don't want to get into this game is better than that game
type flame wars which are worthless and puerile. That was definitely
not my intention in trying to help the original poster out ;).

BB.
