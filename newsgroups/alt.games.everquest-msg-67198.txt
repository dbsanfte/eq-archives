Uh oh, hitting on a pet peeve here.

The reason that most people don't know the laws, is that it is pointless to
read them, you will not understand them, not to mention there are just way
too damned many of them to know them all.  I am a reasonably educated
person, and I have tried to read some of the laws on the books.  Hey, I
know, we need a new law, if a reasonably educated (nonlawyer) person cannot
understand a law, it should not be enforcable.
