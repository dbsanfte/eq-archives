Agnostic is not atheist.
Agnostics do not deny the existance of God (or in EQ's case any Gods) only
refuse to believe without proof, in EQ's case I would say the character has
no interest in worshipping or pledging allegiance to any Gods because if it
was a matter of proof then the first heal you got that saved your bacon
would pretty much convert you.

Given that worshipping a Diety now has some advantages it might be an idea
to allow agnostics to quest for the chance to worship one....Although this
quest should not be an easy one but should be achievable without requiring a
raid force to do it. Something a bit more RP than just killing some big mob
at the end of it.
