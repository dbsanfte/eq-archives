Alternativly play the market.
Buy low sell high.
If you have an always on connection and are willing to invest 2k for a
while in the bazaar you should be able to turn a nice profit.
Especially if you are willing to trawl for people who dont have sol
enabled.
Cause it would work better with a second account.
