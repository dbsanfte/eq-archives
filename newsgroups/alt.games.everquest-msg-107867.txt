Moonfire is NOT ancient. It was originally extremely rare and very crappy
(as in 1/20 drop rate on one monster and the same mana/dmg ratio as Frost);
about 3 weeks ago, it was fixed to have a better ratio, and increased drop
rate, Moonfire now can drop off of the Luclin bosses and minis (documented
drops from: Doomshade, Fyrthek Fior, Grieg, Rhag's 1 and 2)
