I was playing the other day, and someone had some loot from a high
level enemy that he was giving away to some lowbies. He said the
person who rolled highest would get the loot. I rolled a 99 with a
/random 0 100. After that, someone started squawking about how there
was a bug with random when the range is 0 to 100 (incidentally, the
guy that was squawking had rolled a 0). He said that it was more fair
to roll between 100 and 200. Did what he said have merit, or was he
just trying to get a free re-roll?
