At those levels, your talking about 4 groups (at least)

Hes a big fire elemental, 32,000 HP, hits for (been a while) 5 or 600, fire
AE.. resists will help a lot here.
Also something that may help, magician fire pets are *immune* to his ae

The raid should assemble at the Skyfire zone line, and after he's triggered,
pull him to here (ranger works well for the pull)

Hes slowable afaik, so make sure a chanter or shaman is present.  If you can
get any level 60.. a warrior will make SUCH a difference for you.. more than
anything.

Last time I killed Ixi was rather different, I pulled it with a druid,
tanked it on my monk (while healing on my cleric), while 4 guildie wizards
MB'd him and killed him flat.

/mourn MB.. I miss those days :(
