Our guild is a small family type guild that would like to begin to do some
raiding.  With the help of some friends, we killed Vindi last night in Kael
Drakel.

I'd like to know what the general progression is for raids.  I searched the
forums, but couldn't find anything like this.

There are some great guides for planar progression, but we need the little
stuff before that level.  We are looking for some targets to work toward
over the next few weeks and months, but we don't really know where to go.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Bcarshaman
