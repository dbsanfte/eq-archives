Some soloers are still fucked. For example, me. Yeah, the xp penalty is
gone, super. But that group xp sure looks tasty, and I *cant* get any. No
matter how they play with xp bonuses, some classes just arent needed/wanted
in groups. I'll still be soloing, sitting at a zone entrance for 8 hours
trying to get into a group is no fun.
