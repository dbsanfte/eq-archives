I've no clue when druids start. They shouldn't even do it. ;-)

Wizards.... well, that's up for debate. At 29 you get BoF so technically
you can do it then. I did, practicing on the gnolls in SK. Problem is,
your "best" AoE spell at that point is complete ass. Then, at 34 you get
Circle of Force and your'e off to the races.

That's not to say that you can't quad before that, if you are *really*
insane. I made several valient attempts at quadding spiders in EK before
I got BoF, because I had jboots and the spiders are slow.

But for the most part, yes. You need to hold off until you get your AoE
snare to do it efficiently.
