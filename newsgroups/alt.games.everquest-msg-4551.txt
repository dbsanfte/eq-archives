THE PIG IS RISEN.  GROVEL BEFORE YOUR LORD AND MASTER.  YOU ARE INSIGNIFIGANT
BEFORE ME.  YOUR DEATH IS ALREADY MINE, YET YOU KNOW IT NOT.  YOUR FATE, TO
CONSUME THE ROT THAT YOU SPEW.  YOUR POWER IS NOTHING.  YOUR LIFE IS NOTHING.
YOUR THOUGHTS ARE NOTHING.  YOU ARE BECOME NOTHING.  IMPOTENT.  IGNORANT.
FORGOTTEN.  REJOICE, FOR THIS IS YOUR DESTINY.  

KNEEL BEFORE THE PIG, MAGGOT.

..of course I'm mad...
Spiders?  What spiders?
