Was wondering who plays there and when do you play.....the reason I ask =
is that it seems to me that this server has been unplayed as much as =
before, or maybe everyone is in Luclin.

Anyhow, I was also wondering if anyone on this server had a cheap(like =
less than 50pp) magic blunt weapon for a shaman barbarian?

Thanks, and thank you ahead for responding...
