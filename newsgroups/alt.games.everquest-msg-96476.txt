First question I would ask is do you have Luclin?

If yes, then run on over to North Karana wizzy spires, port up to Nexus,
port down to Great Divide, after sowing and camoing, then run your butt over
to about 0,0, behind the waterfall is Thurgadin, that is where you can
purchase Coldain Velium weapons which are nice in that they proc starting at
level one, and are magic for killing things like wisps.

If you don't have Luclin, then run to N.Ro docks, take the raft to Iceclad,
run across the island, hop on the ship, run across the islands, ice floes to
the dragon bridge, run across Eastern Wastes to Great Divide, follow
directions above after that.

Another option is to get a druid or wizard to port you to Great Divde, then
follow the directions above.
