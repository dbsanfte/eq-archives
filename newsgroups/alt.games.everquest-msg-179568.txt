Oh, good lord, you are desperate, aren't you? Usenet standard is to
snip parts of quotes you aren't responding to. I snipped what I didn't
feel was worth my time. Childish babbling isn't worth my time...which
makes me wonder why I quote ANY of what you say.

You know, there's been a new kind of "troll" that has emerged over the
past few years, and they're damn common here. The kind that doesn't
*start* threads to begin flamewars, but the kind that turn other
people's threads into flamewars every chance they get. Makes it so
much easier for them to accuse others of being the trolls...
