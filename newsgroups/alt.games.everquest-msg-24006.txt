I have a lv 45 monk and frequently play with both rangers, warriors and
rogues so I think I have some valid info on this question. While it is true
that at the post 50 game, a well equipped rogue can , in the right situation
out damage everyone, it only applies to certain situations. I do enough
damage and have throughout the game since I started grouping around lv 10 ,
that it's very rare for anyone , warrior or rogue to taunt a mob off me. One
of my guild members is a lv 41 rogue and he can't even come close to the
damage I do in a fight together. But forget about who does the most damage
in a full group with everyone doing there jobs, I can still solo and get
very good experience doing it at lv 45. How many rogues do you know that can
solo anything  for exp at level 45? Or rangers and warriors? My bind wound
skill is at 200, I do 50 points a bandage and at lv 51 the cap comes off and
it will do 80 points a bandage up to 70 percent. But now with the cap at 50
percent I can bind and mend and be at least at 80 percent health every 6
minutes, while killing mobs solo. And I'm not a twink, this is my first
character and everything on him has been earned the hard way.
