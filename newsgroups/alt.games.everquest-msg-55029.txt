Poison yes, since the only dragon with a poison checked AoE is
Whoashit and Trakanon, neither of which is all that difficult.

However, disease?  No way.
Very, VERY fucking critical at higher levels.  Both Hoshkar and Zlexak
have a 1250hp DD + 70% turgur effect disease based AoE.

That AoE is REALLY sucks.  I mean in a way that has to be experienced
to be believed.

Your melee damage output goes from pretty good to pretty much nothing
once that AoE hits.

If you plan on ever hitting VP or ToVN, might consider putting some
disease gear in the bank or on a mule somewhere just in case.
