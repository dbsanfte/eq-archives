   Indeed I am.  It seems that most of the MMORPGs borrow heavily from one
another, taking the good parts, and leaving the bad.  This system is one of
the best features of CoH, I believe.  And one that should be pretty easy to
transfer to other games.

   I may be wrong, but I got the impression that Kaos is saying that since
you and I have never seen each other face to face, or heard each others
voices, we cannot be friends.  Online relationships simply don't count for
very much.  Now me, I personally couldn't agree less.  People have been
known to fall in love and then get married on the basis of a relationship
developed in chat rooms and email.  I think that humans are adaptive enough
that if we can have any sort of contact with one another, we will develop
the full range of relationships that are possible, excluding of course
physical ones if the medium of exchange precludes it.

   Course, this goes contrary to his "they aren't very good friends if they
don't play exactly as you do" statement, so I think we will probably have a
fundamental philosophical difference on this issue.
