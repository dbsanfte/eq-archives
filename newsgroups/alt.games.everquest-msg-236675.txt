Yes, a party can be wiped by bad pet control, /pet hold removes the need to
concentrate so much (read: at all) on pet discipline, but I still dont think
it should be an inate skill. Not everything is reliable 100% of the time  ;p

Am not saying its isn't a major pain without out, which is why I question
your statement that it is 'a basic function' what it does is basic, but what
it means you can do with your pet, isn't.

Not really, /pet back off provides an adequate means to control your pet in
most situations, /pet hold provides total control of your pet. Quite a power
/ convienence jump, yes?

To put it another way, did you feel it was a waste of AA points to get /pet
hold ? (if you have it, that is). Not totally relevant I guess, but a few
class's probably feel the same about some of their own AA.

Anyways, you will get no sympathy from a ranger main on this costing too
many AA...am3/eq is 45AA ffs!! To be able to do  good ranged damage :P
