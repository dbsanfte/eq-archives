It looks to me like lots of people are labeling their messages.  Other
people will pick up on the convention/habit just fine.  Give them 5
minutes to adjust, will you?  Sheesh.

By the way, Usenet convention is a blank line between the text you're
replying to, and your response.  If you're allowed to break that
convention, other people should be allowed to make EQ2 posts in this
newsgroup without an EQ2 label.  :P
