Well, those are fun to flame about too, sure, but why not also flame about 
top posting, then?  And err... survivor?

In general, that's what happens, actually.  The flaming usually doesn't 
start in earnest until the 'waaah, I can top post if I want to and you 
can't stop me' post.

}I still think 
}the flaming in response to the hello newsgroup was entirely off base. 

Some was, some wasn't.  It should be clear by now that very little of this 
thread has anything to do with the new gateway anymore. :)  There are 
legitimate concerns to be had about the new gateway, and they were 
addressed, -mostly- politely.  But yes, some folks did fly off the handle 
prematurely.  Of course, they're partly the voice of experience:

Aye, that part of the argument was quite silly.  But I think most of the 
posts about who was welcoming whom were somewhat tongue-in-cheek. :)

}I know it is general etiquette to lurk, but many people dont feel like 
}lurking. 

I'm sorry, but Translation: "I know it is good manners to keep your feet 
off the furniture, but many people feel like putting their muddy soppy 
boots on my nice clean white upholstery."

}I could post the link and a welcome letter bi weekly, and post 
}it if I notice someone new popping up [like the hello group posts] and 
}when I notice a new top poster  *if* people will let me have a go at the 
}top posters before flaming them.

Well, but then, what do we do if you don't happen to be on?  We can't just 
let the top post sit there unchallenged!  Some other newbie might flame 
them before we get the chance!  Then where would we be?

This is also drifting dangerously close to "may I please moderate the 
newsgroup?"  There are plenty of moderated forums for discussing EQ.  Some 
of us like having one where we can say "fuck" and mean it.  Besides, I 
suspect any would-be moderator would go positively insane after trying to 
sort through all the drivel in here for more than a day or two.  

Feel free to be Faq-posting-person, except Graef may have beat you to it.  
But if he forgets, go for it.  Feel free to race the flamers to say 
'please' before they say something rude.  You may even win once in a 
while.  But I really doubt you're going to actually get flamers to wait 
more than an hour or so. :)

No clue.  Get a real newsreader! (j/k) :)
