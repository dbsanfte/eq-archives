Oh, you're perfectly free to sell the game. However, you don't own the
account...

Their primary reason for saying no selling accounts is so they aren't
expected to get involved in any way if someone rips off someone else
on an account sale.

It also has to do with their copyright and such, but that's another
argument.

(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with the term witchcraft.)
