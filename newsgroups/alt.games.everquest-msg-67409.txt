I hadn't planned on getting SoL, but when the WonderfulWife(tm) and I are 
at the store and she see it and says "Hey, why don't you get that?  Isn't 
that another EQ add-on?", what can I do?

So, I installed it and it works just dandy.  Loving the new models so far, 
especially the equipment.

I made a Cat just to see the town, and decided to go with a Rogue.  I know 
nothing about Rogues, so I went out on a limb and put 10 points in STR, 15 
in STA, and 5 in DEX or AGI, can't remember.

All I have done with this char is the first quest runs that you get sent on 
to learn the town, so I don't mind deleting it and starting over.  I will 
be visiting the SafeHouse soon, but would like your opinions on how I 
should allocate points on a rogue, please.
