What you do is called an exercise in stupidity. I've been 30+ ft in the
air on a double jump and have never missed but maybe once in my
lifetime. Even then I only got scraped up a bit. The better you get on
bikes the less time you spend on the ground. If you really do what you
talk about, which I doubt, you are displaying ignorance not talent. It's
not impressive, it's pitiful.

Avenger.
