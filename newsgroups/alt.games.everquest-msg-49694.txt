Well, again i can only say that the exact same words was used to describe AO and
look at how people flee from it.
You can not in ANY way judge if DAoC is a good game before it have run at least
a few months. Then the startup problems "should" have been sorted out, and you
can actually start to see how the game works. Thats when people started to leave
AO. I wont be surpriced if people do the same with DAoC.
