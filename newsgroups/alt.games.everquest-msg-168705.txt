    ND 1, 2, 3 gives you 2%, 5%, 10% total increase on your HPs due to STA,
base HPs, or gear. So if you got a STA buff, the 10% boost from ND 3 would
apply to those HPs, but would not apply to the extra HPs from Aegolism. If
you want to play around and see how much benefit it would be for you
unbuffed, Magelo does the calculation correctly. So make a dummy Magelo with
your gear, then give it some level of ND and see how the HPs change.
