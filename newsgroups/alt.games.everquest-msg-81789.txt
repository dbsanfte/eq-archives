Ok, I see. I guess I'll probably not have that problem, since I never group
anymore. (tried it with my dumbass sister in law a few days ago and she got
me killed within 10 minutes!) I was just wondering. I'd never even looked at
my own line of spells for higher level, since I figured it would be awhile
(at the rate I'm going!) before I even get high enough to take a last name
:) And I've never had a cleric older than 5, so I wasn't sure what was
involved in the cost.
