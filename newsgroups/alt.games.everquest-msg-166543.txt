You know what would really stop me from selling my level 56 druid for
400 bucks? If I did after like 156 days played, over four years or
something, the 3744 hours would mean that I was paid roughly 11 cents
an hour. I just could NOT feel good about that. I also don't think I'd
even get 400 bucks anymore.
