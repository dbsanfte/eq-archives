LOL, don't be sorry...the first year I was down there I had moved 
from Rohchester NY with a fiancee who turned out to be seriously 
physically abusive, and after a year of being out from under his 
jackbooted heel [metaphorically speaking] I met my husband, and 
we were there for another 6 years before they shipped us up to 
Groton.

I have memories like getting up at oh my fucking god and taking 
Rob to the base and heading out to go fishing and crabbing at the 
Lynnahven Fishing Pier [$2.00US for 24 hours. A $1.00US package 
of chicken backs, 3 tidewater nets and a fishing rod = 3 of 4 
bushels of blue crabs, and a cooler of croaker and flatfish, and 
an occasional sea robin + that little fish market down by the 
Anchor Inn = 1 bushel of blue crab, a selection of fish, a bag of 
mussels, clams and oysters, a couple pounds of shrimp and 
scallops and some corn meal for making hush puppies ... and a 
bunch of guys from the division making a good old seafood gorge=)

Walking on the beach right before sunrise and watching the crabs 
looking nervous while scuttling sidewise...

Sailfest at Waterside, sitting on the balcoy of the british pub 
hearing some unnamed irish folk band and chowing sown on the 
stuffed baked brie, and killians red...

Getting my open water 1 and 2 - diving teh channel bridge and the 
tower - pulling up shellfish and other goodies and seeing a pod 
of dolphins swimming around us.

Nantucket sleighride out fishing for amberjack.

Watching the subs coming back into the barn, with the sailors out 
on the topside in dress whites. Change of command ceremonies with 
punch, cookies and cake followed by a BBQ party at the 'boat 
house'[where 7 or8 guys off the boat shared a huge rambling house 
over in Newport News] with Taflinger passing out and getting 
*decorated* with a lipstick 'hi mom' on his butt [OK, you sort of 
had to be there]
