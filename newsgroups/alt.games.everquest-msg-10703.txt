Knowing how Verant operates (ie Forcing players to group and
interact), I am sure it will all be done with Wiz or Dru
teleportation. Since Wizards are the most unwanted class in Norrath,
they will most likely be the only one that can transport you to
Luclin. It will probably be the same type of bone tossed at Wizards as
teleportation to certain planes.

Wizards are by far the least wanted class in a group. Their only value
in a group (besides evacs) is clean up hitter on half-dead mobs. I
wouldn't put it past Verant to launch Luclin and say, "See Wizards are
needed. They are the only class that can get you to Luclin."

I'm not trying to put down Wizards. I am just stating the common
perception, and pariah class status they have been given EQ.

Cheers
