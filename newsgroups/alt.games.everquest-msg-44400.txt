There's a "magic number" for weapon damage, which is basically 2 x
base_weapon_damage + 1.  So an 8/24 Ykesha for example has a magic
number of 17.  Beyond level 28, meleers get an additional one point
bonus each three levels, so a level 50 warrior would then have a bonus
of 8, giving a magic number of 25 with that Ykesha.  This bonus applies
to the main hand only, and only melee classes get this bonus, casters
do not.

There's also a maximum damage you can do with a weapon.  Someone put
together an extremely informative chart based on a lot of log parsing
showing the damage distribution: the *vast* majority of hits will be
clustered around the magic number.  A small percentage will be at or
near the maximum weapon damage.  I can't find a link to this article
now, but I'll keep looking.  Maybe someone else can post it here?

The only thing STR affects is the maximum weapon damage: increasing STR
increases the maximum damage slightly.  It has no effect on the magic
number.

This is why STR has such a minimal effect on your damage output: 100
points of extra STR will only improve your damage output by a couple of
percent, simply because the proportion of hits at maximum damage are
very low compared with hits at or near the magic number.

Don't think so.

>  3) Also, how do the damage caps work?

Capped at 19 until level 10, and at 29 until level 20, then no cap.  I
do recall seeing the odd hit at 31 or 32 with my troll warrior when he
was in his teens - I think this is his naturally high STR raising the
maximum damage by a point or two.  Very uncommon to see those 31/32
point hits though.
