Yes, I do. EQ is a poor soloers game, aimed largely at groups. At some 
level though EQ is a guild game, because pick up groups can only get so 
far... this is one of those cases. Because a you can get a guild group 
anywhere... but you have to slum around the hot spots to get a pickup group.

A good guild at least would be be willing to run with you through the 
theme of your need. (Hell... there are *surely* other necros in your 
position... who need the same theme).
