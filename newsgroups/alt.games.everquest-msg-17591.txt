AFAIK no one has ever found a staff of mastery for fire -

The effect of the staff of mastery is different from the
lower focus items - they increase your pets level by 1 and
it's max damage by 2.

There is an explanation of focus items (not for you Marc,
I assume by 40 you know, but for the other readers who
are interested), Staves of Mastery and a great chart
that has pet level/max damage and a partial HP chart,
plus special abilities gained by level.
