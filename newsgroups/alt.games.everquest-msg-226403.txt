This wasn't a problem with "alpha male syndrome".  This guy was being a jerk. 
He was pulling *while* you were pulling?   Huh??? Why in the world would you
*want* to group with a guy who put your group in a dangerous situation more
than once?

Your *great* bard wasn't just whining to the other groupmembers in /tell he was
also whining on his /guild channel about you.  I was in a group one day where
we had a druid one day who was /telling me about what a shitty chanter and
warrior we had and how the necro played like a newb.  He was also /telling the
shitty chanter what a shitty cleric we had.  Little did he know the shitty
chanter is my BF and was sitting right behind me.  I don't know what *makes*
people like this, but I added him to my ignore list.
