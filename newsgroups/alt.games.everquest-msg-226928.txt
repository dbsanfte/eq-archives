Don't you get Divine Light at 53?

1: Increase Hitpoints by 880 (L53) to 910 (L56)
Mana:350
Casting Time:4.50

or did you mean 52?

Also do you keep Blessing of Faith up on yourself, cause this sometimes
makes the difference between life and death in LDON.........

1: Increase Spell Haste by 10%
2: Limit: Max Level(61)
3: Limit: Spell(Complete Healing excluded)
4: Limit: Min Casting Time(3.00 sec)
5: Limit: Effect(Percentage Heal excluded)

Anyway, that said, I keep the biggest healing spam heal loaded, in LDON -
don't really think Sup. heal is cut out for the job at 53 - more time
efficient to use the bigger one as you have to factor in the damn recast
times as well.  The more HP's you can dump on someone quickly, the better.
I'd use the above two spells I linked.

All spell data above from Allak's.
