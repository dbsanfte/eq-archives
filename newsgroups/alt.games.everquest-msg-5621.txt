The char of mine who gets summoned the most is my cleric, though my
shaman got a nice steady chain of like 10 in a row the other night in
SF.  When the cleric gets summoned by anything other than a big dragon
he likes to taunt them verbally... you know...  "Say my name!!" and "Who
loves you baby??", but when its a big dragon I maintain steady focus and
as soon as I feel myself being pulled hit one of the invulnerable spells
asap.  I was summoned 3 times by Naggy before dieing last raid using
that technique heh, managed to get a barrier off the first two times and
get out of range before he finished me.  Even when I do get killed its
just so silly (and unavoidable) that laughing makes much  more sense
than being upset about it.  Seems odd as death is normally no fun at
all, but dieing like this is just a crack up.
