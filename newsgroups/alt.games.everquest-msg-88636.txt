It summons a mob from a mob type available in zone. Hill giants and
cyclopses are the same mob type, aviaks and spirocs are the same mob
type, jungle spiders and carrion spiders are the same mob type,
goblins fire goblins and aqua goblins are all the same mob type.
Hence, you can get cyclopses in WC, spirocs in SK, jungle spiders in
WK, and aqua goblins in Lavastorm.
