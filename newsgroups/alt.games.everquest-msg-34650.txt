That is mean, I love Ann Landers (not really though, bahahhah)

Ann needs to be schooled on this issue, I may write her and I think
other people should also. She has no understanding of the MMORPG crack
(from the post there is probably a 95 percent chance the game is
Everquest) Ann is working from the standpoint that its a "hobby" so
something must be lacking in the wife's life and as you say almost
suggesting it is the spouse's fault.

If a husband wrote in that his wife was hooked on heroin or crack, did
heroin or crack for hours and talked to some other user/supplier on
the phone for 2 hours you can bet that Anne would not say "Take your
crack whore out to dinner and show her a good time, that should work!"
Instead Anne would probably say to seek professional help, therapy,
drug counseling, treatment centers, etc. The same would be true of
something relating a spousal booze addiction. 

Anne does not get the MMORPG crack thing. She needs to understand that
it is like drugs or booze with nearly the same life altering effects.
It is something new of course since well, they were not here like 4
years ago were they?
