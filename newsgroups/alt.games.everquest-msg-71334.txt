From the Patch Message:

*  Soulbinders *

A new group has appeared in Norrath (and on Luclin as well).  Rumor has it
that these 'Soulbinders' have dedicated themselves to research on the power
and essence of our inner being.  Some call them fanatics, as they claim that
knowledge of the spirit that dwells within will lead them to an
understanding of the whole of existence.  Citizens often treat them with the
same respect and distance that they treat the Priests of Discord.  However,
these Soulbinders  have dedicated themselves to public service, and for them
that service falls along their lines of specialty...

The next time you find yourself far away from home, you might seek the
services of a Soulbinder.

/ooc: We've added these "Soulbinder" NPCs to all cities that player
characters can start in, as well as Shadowhaven and Iceclad at the request
of players.  It is our hope that these new NPCs will help players by
reducing the time it takes to find a bind from another player character.

I hope this works as the folks at Verant seem to intend.  I have no problem
paying for a bind, and will still offer that first.  On the other hand, I
sometimes play at odd times, and have trouble getting a bind in some of the
more out of the way places (like Halas).
