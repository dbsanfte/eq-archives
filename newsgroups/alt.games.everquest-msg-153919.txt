I have 2 main chars. One is a Druid and the other a Paladin. I made a Druid
char just to enjoy going all over the place and solo mobs how ever I
like.(root rot, single kite, fear kite, quad kite) The Paladin however is
more a group char, and yes I can solo nicely with rooting the mob and heal
yourself once in while.

The Druid did group yes, not that often and mostly in guild business. Now
I'm thinking of creating a group char, Rogue/Bard/Cleric and see how that
goes...

Also have a baby Necro and gonna solo him as long as I can.
