Subject: Is there a list of Beastlord Guild Quests somewhere?

I'm playing two different Beastlords, one Barbarian and one Vah Shir. I was
wondering if there was a list of Beastlord Guild Quests somewhere, preferrably
telling what you get as a result of completing the quests.

I'm currently still trying to make the leather straps for my Vah Shir (failed
at making the straps five times so far), and am starting to work on the wepon
quest for my Barbarian (have the hunting bow, but still need the gnoll and
snake fangs).
