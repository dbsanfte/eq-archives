Depends on how you count, I guess.  The wizzy spires in WK have only 3 zones
"between" them and Halas or Perma (QH, BB, EP).  I hope they don't add
anything in Everfrost or QH.  I like those areas being remote.  But I
suppose if they ever add zones in that area (unkempt woods, etc),  they'll
end up putting at least a druid ring around there.

If they allow some sort of auto port to and from luclin, I hope the "from"
is to only one location.  NK would be the logical choice, so I'm sure it
would be Stonebrunt ;-). In any case,  I hope they avoid the firepot room
scenario mentioned earlier.  Otherwise every melee in the game will be bound
at one point...heh heh
