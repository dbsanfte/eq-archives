After the damage cap lifts (at 20) your damage is distributed like this
*                          *
*          ****          *
*        ******         *
*   *************    *
*************************

The first spike is your minimum damage (before 28th level that's 1)
The 3rd narrow spike is know as the "magic number."  (before 28th
level that's (2*(Weapon Damage)) + 1.
The scattering of hits above the MN (magic number) range up to Max
damage.
The rest of the hits are distributed roughly normally between MIN and MAX.

After level 28 melee types (warrior, rogue, monk, ranger, sk, pally) get a
damage bonus on the primary hand.

At that point MIN is 1+ (Level Damage Bonus) and the MN is
(2*weapon damage) + (level damage bonus).

Max damage is
[((Weapon Skill + Strength)/100) * (Weapon Damage)) + (Level Damage Bonus)]

)

So, if my usual weapon is a walrus tusk (6/22) and I'm not hasted -
My minimum damage is 1
My Magic Number is 12 or 13
and I swing it (poke it?) every 2.2 seconds
(Not counting any double attacks, and in
the primary hand)

If I grab a rusty dagger on a CR (3/22 ?)
my  MIN is still 1
my MN is now 6 or 7
and I swing every 2.2 seconds

A great piercer for warriors and rogues (and the int casters if you're still
meleeing) is a walrus tusk (6/22 - magic with a couple of +3 to stats)

You can pay for it, or get one for free by running down to the Eastern
Wastes, go to 600, -2000 and hang around the folks hunting Ulthork.
The tusk is Lore, so once they've looted one, they let the rest rot.  Ask
*Nicely* if you can loot one.

For the second weap -- I'm not sure.
