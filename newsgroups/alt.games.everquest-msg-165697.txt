Sure they do, picking up a welfare check doesn't take much time.  The
extreme ends of the spectrum (the gainfully unemployed, ie not looking for
work, and the rich) have the time.  It's the working stiffs that have to put
in hours of overtime to make ends meet that don't have the time, and
personally, I wouldn't call them loosers.
