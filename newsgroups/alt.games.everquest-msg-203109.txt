This always cracks me up.  Lots of people seem to think that the
"right to free speech" is some sort of absolute.  It ain't.

Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, but
you're perfectly able to abridge it on your own, for example by
entering into a private contract which forbids cursing.

If you want to maintain your "right to free speech", don't enter
into any contracts which limit it.
