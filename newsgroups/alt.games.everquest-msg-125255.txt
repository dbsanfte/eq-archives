Ummmm, guys I wasn't trying to throw grease on a fire here. I thought
the original question referred to a guide, is all, and guides definitely
can't do it. GM's can. As I said, I also have no clue as to whether
Seniors or the Elder (for the what....? Two servers that have an elder?)
can. No clue there. I also suppose I can't "prove" anything for DT as I
don't even have a screenshot of anything. Never saw any point in looking
for one. But if you go back to the screenshots of the Conquest incident
(closest I can think of to "proof" if it really matters) you'll see a GM
answering in /say to a direct comment made in /guild.

Seriously, it's not an issue. And if you stop to think about it from a
purely design perspective, would *you* build a game where the potential
for abuse among a guild was a consideration (as it sadly must be watched
for, in some cases) and your paid CS staff had a whole channel of
communications that they couldn't access if the need arose on the spot?
Sneaky, sure... ;-)  but smart design if ya ask me. 

Oh god. Did I really just type that?
