yep, on Lanys it's Market - had 52 people in it this morning.  I'm
trying to float the idea of a Taxi channel for people offering/looking
for rides.

On foci - WOW :)

my big nuke at 51 is the 49 lava bolt (810 dam)  The middle tier
damage bracer ( I can't summon the top tier one yet) got my max
to 972 (20% increase) although that wasn't common.

Middle tier ring (spell haste) is 15% reduction in cast time -
Summon Vocerate Earth goes from 10sec to 8.5.  You can verify
this by right clicking on the spell icon and holding.  It gives
normal cast time and your cast time.  This is also the middle
tier one.  The bottom tier one has the same reduction - Bug?
I gave one to a cleric, but didn't have much time for feedback.
However, reducing C Heal from 10 secs to 8.5 would certainly
be worthwhile.
