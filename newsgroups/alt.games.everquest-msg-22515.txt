*That is the only way you will get justice.*

If you consider a life sentence getting butt-raped justice...

It's easy to rationalize things to your particular needs. Like a world wide
conspiracy of jocks. lol. Harder to realize that by doing what you suggest,
you're the lowest of the low. Just get through fucking school and get to the
real life. Remember who you are is what you make of yourself. Blaming others
is a bad case of pussyitis.
