    Ah, ok - that can change things. We have one strong Japanese guild, and
a smattering of Euro/Asian players, but not enough to do things like set up
AoE groups and own large chunks of zones. Late night in Sebilis is one
non-North American group at NG, and some unemployed North Americans.

    Soloers and duoers rarely touch the Dregs or the Fungusbeasts. They hit
too hard, don't cast like 'Shrooms, and in the case of the Fungusbeasts are
too annoying to pull. I could see folks camping the nearby mushroom patches,
though.

    If you get endgamers, remind them they need to kill them for their
Serubane weapons and Vex Thal key shard. :-)

    Callers is wonderful fun, if you have a group. Semi-challenging fights,
chance at some loot beyond cash sellables, and you're far enough away from
others that you don't have to worry about being creamed by an AoE group's
train/pull. The only concern is the kill rate might be slightly too fast or
slow for your group (not very customizable).

    There's a reason for that. :-)

    Depends where you set up. There are places people don't camp - or,
rather, before the Vex Thal shard there were.

    Heh, the times I've been there I see them in ooc but never in person.
Turn off ooc and they disappear. I can imagine servers where they swarm all
over looking to loot stuff, though. <shudder>

    CoP. The spell every melee begs to get, the one that has large effects
on damage output vs. XP mobs in Luclin. My class only has the one buff too
that folks want, and we're a buff class. You also have SoW outdoors,
although some other classes have that.

> and you yourself have denigrated Ranger damage output and taking.

    Not output, just the taking part. For output you're fair. I still think
rangers should be set to 1.05 times a warrior's damage output as a target,
but you know VI.

evaccer?

    Not a lot. With AA abilities and gear these days, a lot of folks just
aren't challenged by dungeons like they were. I can remember when Sebilis
was a dangerous place. Now, I ran down with the wizard I went there with
from zone-in to Chef, where two enchanters were waiting for us so we could
AoE everything from Gangrenous to us. Invis? Why bother? Just pull any mobs
along the way with us, so we can warm up on them. The places that *need*
evac now are the places that cannot be walked out of by a melee, places like
The Hole and the lower pit area in Velk's.

> (Technically none, if your fighters all have gate potions, I know.

    Naw, that's unrealistic. But the days of "evaccer for safety" are mostly
over.

    More should. Making Thurg gate potions is an important skill if you're
non-KOS to Coldain.

    Where do you get this from? They can't even keep up to the melees in
their group!!

    Ok, now you're really off your rocker. Wizards are one of the most
end-loaded classes in the game. Until 29, soloing is a painful experience.
Until they reach 34, soloing is still relatively poor (they have snare but
lack a credible pillar AoE, so you're looking at a lot of snare-kiting). All
through the 50's, all they get is versatility as opposed to power. At 60,
they get all the power nuke toys and become the powerhouse they are regarded
as.

    Fighters can take hits from mobs, casters crumple like tin foil if they
get aggro.

     A fighter paired with a healer can kill until the cows come home. A
caster paired with any mana pump class you could name cannot match that kill
rate.

    Casters MUST use mana , and fairly significant amounts of it, to earn
experience. They have enforced downtime. Fighters, properly twinked, take
minimal damage soloing low blues, and thus have almost no downtime. Once
twinked, that fighter can go anywhere he wants and not require anyone else -
the twink caster requires someone to support him with Clarity if he wants to
match the low downtime.

> Casters solo mobs four at a time

    TWO casters do this. Most casters crumple if they get an add when
soloing, compared to the twink melee which is merely forced to use extra
bandages.

> fighters aren't supposed to be solo at all.

    It is trivial to solo a ranger with Panic Animal, a Shadow Knight, any
flavour of twink warrior or monk.... About the only melee that really
doesn't solo well is the rogue, and you can even get him pretty high with a
Fungi and solid weapons/haste. When a friend decided to level up a cleric,
do you think he went and root-nuked undead? Hell no! He gave his cleric a
FBSS, Fungi, and Iksar Berserker Club and meleed his way to 30 in a few
days. Melee damage is what EQ is about.

    Now I wonder about your AoE experience. Typically, a wizard pulls.
Warriors like the one in my guild, with Flurry and Earthshaker, are rare.
Shamans and Necromancers typically have no role in an AoE group, and druids
and mages are avoided in favour of clerics and wizards where possible. The
"standard" AoE group is a three-class deal, and that excludes pretty much
everyone else.

    I'm sure you can. Lord, I didn't realize the class envy was that bad.

    By who, disgruntled melees? Kunark was the melee expansion - melee
damage went up by leaps and bounds to easily surpass caster damage output,
even on raids. Mobs began to get the excessive resist rates we see today -
how many spells land on Trakanon, again? Spells in Kunark mostly added
utility to casters, not power, and in some cases pre-Kunark spells were
nerfed so the Kunark spells would be upgrades (Turgur's, pets...). I will
solidly agree that pre-Kunark casters were more powerful by degrees of
magnitude, but not since. SoL is just bringing things back into balance, and
even then only at the top end of the game.

    Resist rates were much more detrimental to casters than the 32K cap
being exceeded. It's one thing to say "my damage contribution as a
percentage of the whole has decreased", it's another to say "I can't land
any spells on that mob so my damage contribution is nothing".

    What are you smoking? Go someplace and try to get a group as a mage,
necromancer, wizard, druid - nobody wants you. People want clerics, to heal
the multiple melees in the group; enchanters, to mez adds and haste the
multiple melees in the group; and shamans, to slow mobs and buff the
multiple melees in the group.

    Incorrect quote. Eliminate the "a melee" part. With the exception of the
MT and the CH chain, any other person could likely go LD and nobody would
freak out. That changes in the more extreme fights, where roles like
"feeding mana to the CH team" or "offtanking adds" become crucial, but in
general it's true.

    You don't even have Monk HPs, though. Try and get those.

    Velk's named dog is - upper and lower dogs are the two best camps for XP
in Velk's, excluding some aberration where there's only one group doing the
spiders. Sadly, for my guild right now, Ssra trash mobs are also our
standard XP fare. Booooo Emperor keys!
