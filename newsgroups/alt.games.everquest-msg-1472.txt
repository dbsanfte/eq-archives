Pul-Leeze! I get jumped by an ice-boned. I think "Need to get back to
my partner so we can kill it." Then I think "Wait, that group of people
who horned in on our camp might possibly get trained if I run by then."
Then I think "Okay, let me run the LONG way around so that doesn't
happen."

Right.

Ah, but.. if I zoned some poor unfortunate might get killed. So it was
my responsibility to fight until my last breath so that wouldn't happen.

Oh, that isn't how it works? People train to zone all the time? Wow..

Must be all that sun that makes people crazy once they spend too much
time in Oasis. Me, I like the zone just fine. 'Course I'm a clueless
heartless newbie who doesn't know better. I train people on purpose and
get them killed (all the time). I spit on their rotting corpses and
laugh. I can't wait 'til I get high enough to train spectres to the
dock all day long. And sand giants, too. What fun!!!
