Head to the caves outside Dalnir in warsliks woods, there is a 3 spawn
cave and 2 spawn cave of brutes(assuming you have the kunark
expansion). Non-aggro, non-social mobs, and good exp til about 30. Exp
starts slowing down at around 30, you could stay through 30 but it
gets boring but its very safe. The loot is not bad either. The millers
had my necro feigning death more often than not at 27, especially if a
guard was aggroed.

cheers!
