Suggestions:
* Use /usercolor to adjust the fontcolors to more readeable colors. Took
some time to adjust them, but works well now.
* Play in 1024x768 and adjust the detaillevels/clipplane if neccessay to
keep framerates decent. In 1024 you can have have inventory up without it
overlapping the itemwindow.
