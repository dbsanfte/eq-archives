I just bought a PNY PCI Verto GeForce2 MX400.  I have a Creative Sound
Blaster X-Gamer sound card.  It seems these two cards don't want to
work well together.  I am running a Compaq 7588 (Pentium 3  550Mhz)
with 384 MB memory.  My OS is Windows 98 SE.  

I installed the latest drivers for both cards.  I've changed the
positions of every card in my system, putting the graphics card at the
top now.  I've fdisked my hard drive and reinstalled everything from
the ground up.  Everything worked just fine until I installed my sound
card drivers.  Now, whenever I try to open any program and the window
opens it takes forever for it to display.  Parts load and then my
system pauses for a few seconds... then more loads, then pauses and so
on and so forth until the application loads.  If I try to scroll the
window up and down everything moves a bit and then freezes for a
couple seconds and then scrolls a bit more.  Sometimes when a sound
plays I hear a loud sqwelching sound instead.   I've been fighting
this for days now and I'm at my wits end.

Yes, I tried calling PNY tech support about the problem.  I called the
moment their tech support opened and was told there was a wait time of
over 15 minutes and therefore had to leave my name and number and
they'd call me back.  Two days later... still no call from them.  So,
here I am posting this message hoping someone who knows more than me
can help.  If anyone has any ideas or knows how to flat out fix this
problem, please help me.
