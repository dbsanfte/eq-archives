    That reminds me.  Does that female who was obsessed with Legolas in
the LotR movie still hang out here?  I've forgotten her posting name.  I
vaguely remember her posting how she was nervous because she cussed out
some poor slob who was killing guards in the commons, and perhaps a
guild as well, and might get suspended for it.  Anyways, if she is still
around, she might appreciate any slash you have regarding the elf.  Or
maybe not... might be entertaining to see her reaction either way.

Annie <--- Not at all interested in reading any slash at all
