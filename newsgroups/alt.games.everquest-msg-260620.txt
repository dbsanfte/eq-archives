Which is why I don't like it. It shows an appalling, if not truly
disgusting lack of imagination and creativity on their part. I know
not everyone is blessed with a first class mind and creativity.
Particularly in a MMOG since it is a primarily visual medium, and
attracts those that can not make up worlds of their own where Pen and
Paper games take much more practice (i.e. playing old school D&D) but
people should either take the lore that is already presented in game
and go with it, or take some time to come up with something at least
somewhat unique.
