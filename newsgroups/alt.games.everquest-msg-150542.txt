 There is no such thing as a "full group bonus". Never has been. But the
myth of such a bonus has persisted for a long, long time. The only "bonus"
you get is having a full, well rounded group. In such a group, XP is gained
much faster simply because the group is more -efficient-. That is the way
Sony/Verant designed the game and is intended to be played.
