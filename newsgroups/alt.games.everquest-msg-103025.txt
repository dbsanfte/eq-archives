actually one of the fastest ways to raise all the factions in katta is once you
are dubious to validus custodus due the twilight sea quest right outside of
katta they raise all the factions in katta a lot went from my original dubious
with my ogre shaman too indifferent with 4 pieces.Only the quests right outside
katta will raise these factions the ones in the enchanters castle wont.Also
rallos zek is not considered an evil god so if your warrior  ogre is a rallos
worshipper the only thing you need to worry about in katta are the coterie
vampires.
