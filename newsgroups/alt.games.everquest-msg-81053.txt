Wow.  This is a big one.  I don't think I can remember a patch that has 
so many items affect me personally.  I think my guild will be happy too.

Nice, but I think I'm gonna miss the old camp.  Our entertainment officer 
already had a new deck of Trivial Pursuit cards.

Nice, I assume Beastlords are leather class.  We should be able to pretty 
much equip our one 55+ BL with our leftover drops now.

Damn, this has only been broken since the game went live.  I wonder if 
they fixed all the bard mail quests?  

> - Increased the spawn rate of Brother Qwinn tenfold

Hmm, is he in Rathe Mtns or where?  I've seen him up fairly often, but as 
a tracker, I often don't realize I've seen an almost mythical mob until 
weeks after I run across him.

Nice, though looking at the stats as the were before, I'm not really gonna 
be using any of this armor, unless it's changed to be better than Kael 
quest armor.

> - Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces

Bah!  Now we can't tease our BLs about their 6ac Wild Lord trousers

Aha, nice, this was mentioned on the bard boards yesterday.

Yay!  I can finally work with throwing weapons again.  I haven't had a 
ranged weapon hotkey since I got my RBF because I didn't want to possibly 
lose it.  Finally, I've got another combat skill to work on.  Woot!

Nice, especially since I'm still wearing one of these.  Hmmm, why don't I 
have a WW Talisman?

Aha, human bards will be happier now.

Is this proc level?  If so, a nice change, though not really that 
critical.

Nice, will make those 2 cleric groups effective again.

Yeah!  Finally!  This one finally makes travel reasonable from anywhere to 
anywhere.  Especially since I took a TL to GD rather than GF because I was 
teasing the wizard the other night.

Very nice, was afraid that Luclin was going to be limited to only a few 
decent items dropping in select places, and I didn't want to get into 
competition with LoD, AV, and TD for the Ring of <foo> battle.

> ** Horses **

Bah, horses, ptui!  Bards don't need no steenkeen horsees!

I think I'm going to be happy when my Luclin songs work in the planes.  
Now if they would work in VP, I'ld be really happy.

Hmm, this was supposed to be fixed a couple patches ago.  I know they 
fixed the instrument skill ups, but my singing has been maxxed, so I 
wouldn't have seen if they had changed singing skill improvements.  An 
issue since October or November though, glad it's fixed.

> ** Visual Issues **

No more screaming chihuahua battlegroups?  Harrrumph!

Hmmm, might be a good idea to find a face you like and pick it now.  They 
will probably be locking in faces very soon.

Yep, this one is minor but got on my nerves.

Nice.  Is this the same issue as happens in Velk's Labs, or are they two 
different bugs?  I've seen it in EJ and PoG, never really hunted enough in 
WL or SoNH to see it.  Was noticing it at CE in Velk's last night though.


> ** Performance Issues **

> - More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones

Nice, though my zone times for Luclin are probably as low as zone times 
pre-Luclin now, and my non-Luclin zone times are faster than they've ever 
been.  Optimization is a good thing.

> - "Hitch" created when player characters enter a zone should be gone now

Only noticed this very recently.  Is this a recent bug, or was it 
generally limited to Luclin?

Nice, especially if the higher resolutions cause you to crash to desktop.  


Arolpin
hmmm, EQ SoL post-beta release 1, nice
