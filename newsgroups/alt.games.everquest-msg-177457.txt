    Ok, I'm not reading this whole thread, so I'm probably gonna repeat
this, but as far as removing the boats go, you must know of some other way
to get to OOT that I don't know. (Not being TOO sarcastic here, if there is
another way, let me know, it'll save me the 20 minute wait).  Maybe they
could put some gnomish motor on the boats.  I'm up for bringing back the
translocators.
    While I agree with the basis of what you are saying, I'm gonna argue a
different standpoint.  I'm only able to play for a few hours a week, I don't
want to spend a quarter of my time sitting on a dock waiting for a boat.
And so you know, I've played since a month or so after beta, so yes, I was
around when you had to brave all of the dangers to run across norath, and if
you have the time, I think that's a wonderful way to view the game, but I
wouldn't CHOOSE to do that anymore.  Some people can, though, don't use PoP.
Sucks when you tell someone 'i'll meet you here in 2 minutes', though, and
it will take you 40 to get there.  /sigh.
