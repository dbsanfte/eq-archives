Subject: General in Kith Forest for Rogue Epic

So, I'm working on my rogue's epic, and I've heard rumor that it's possible to
spawn the general twice in a row (granted both people who need the general's
pouch have the sealed box to spawn him). Another rogue friend of mine is also
working on his epic, and organizing one raid to kill one guy twice in a row is
much easier and convenient then trying to organize two seperate epic mob raids.
Does anyone know if this is true, or just rumor?
