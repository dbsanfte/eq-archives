    The following types of armour: Tolan's, Donal's, Blood Ember,
Mrylokar's, Cobalt, Deepwater, Jaundiced Bone, Singing Steel, and whatever
the hell the druid armour is called. Yeah, the stuff that mostly drops in KC
and Sebilis. The bracers from those sets sell to a vendor for about 225 pp,
as another data point. Oh, and Skull-Shaped Barbutes sell for 63 plat - I
saw one being sold for 50 last night and left it for you. ;-)

    Do a search in the Bazaar. Most of those are already priced above 333
plat, especially on the sought-after sets like Cobalt. But every so often a
price war starts on something common like Jaundiced or Donal's Arms and
you'll see prices dip to the 300 plat range or lower before another trader
like me comes along, scoops it all and vendors it.
