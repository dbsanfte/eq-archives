Well - today in a flash of inspiration I came to the realization that I
finally have a Character ready for planar excursions as well as dragon
raids. Now I realize that many deaths shall be in my future in these places
regardless of my knowledge base, but I would nonetheless, like to learn as
much as I can about the regions before I jump headfirst into a mixed raid of
idiots (or make myself look like one)! EQ Atlas has long been my primary
source of information for zones and such but I am unable to find any
information on planes there. Thus the point of this long and rambling post
is - could anyone kindly point me towards some good websites for information
on Raids and these upper level excursions. Thank you in advance and let me
briefly apologize if this is a common topic, I do hate to be redundant.
Hunt well and Be safe....
