Okies... Did some experimenting in odus...
Warrens indeed was a pain.. Everything on the entrance was too green, and
the other end was capped with a black/white kobbo which i wasn't able to
solo at 15. Managed to somehow struggle the last bits of lvl15 up there
(Atleast i learned how to use charm :)). New pet and DDs were a relief.
On saturday i was going to make it to lvl17 in stonebrunt. But, oh woe, my
plans were ruined when my pothead friends decided to pop in and waste my
whole saturday by conquering my computer and net connection for their
selfish purposes of leeching crappy pothead music videos. Oh well....
Atleast this time they brought their own munchies instead of raiding my
fridgerator. :)
Krhm... Back on the topic.
On sunday i started playing with my guild buddie in stonebrunt. He is a
lvl21 druid and i was lvl16 enchanter so we thought first this wouldnt work.
But how wrong i was. I flew through lvl17 in no time, and druid got pretty
decent exp too. No deaths at all. Friend had to leave at some point, so i
continued soloing the stuff near zone to warrens/stonbrunt (both sides of
zoneline).
Before i had to go to sleep i managed to make my lvl18.
Actually, pretty sweet exp.
Just conned the kobbo camp at the side of the river on the way to cat city.
It was now yellow to me. Sooo.. I'm going to make 2 lvl's more near the
zoneline and then move to that camp when i get my new spells&pet.
I think i dont have to go anywhere from this zone before lvl30 or so. :)
Also while i was eating and watching the declaration of war on the BBC world
(I dont have any other international news channels), i ran around the zone
invised and followed some mobs.
Seems that atleast part of the roaming routes are fixed so i think it is
fairly safe to take a camp once you have memorized the nearby roaming routes
and dont sit to meditate on them.
