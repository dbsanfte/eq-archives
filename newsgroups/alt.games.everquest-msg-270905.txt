The last time I ordered anything from Best Buy (when I was getting
my spouse a copy of CoH back in August), they confirmed they had it
in stock, and I arranged to pick it up at the store.  When I got
there I had to wait half an hour while the sole person running the
pickup desk dealt with another customer.  Then she checked around
and told me they didn't actually have the game in stock.

The crowning insult was that they continued to send me emails for
the next several days reminding me that I had an item reserved and
hadn't picked it up yet.

p.s.: You'll notice I did say it was the last time I ordered anything
from Best Buy...
