This past weekend I decided that enough was enough.  I didn't like the
surname that I gave my wizard...it's the first name of my primary character
and the name isn't at all aesthetically pleasing.

So I petition and am told (by a level 20 apprentice guide) that names are
only changed if they violate.  Now, chances aren't TOO bad that this newbie
guide didn't know what the hell she was talking about and I meant to
petition later, when she wasn't on, but I forgot.  Hopefully I'll remember
to re-post my results when I get them.
