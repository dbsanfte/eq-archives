True, I don't use it, and I don't personally have any experience with how
good or bad it is.  What I said before was that IF you are going to go back
to a version of Windows 9x, don't go to Win me, go to Win 98.  I made no
recommendation whatsoever regarding XP, which is not a version of Win 9x.  I
have heard that some people do have issues with XP, usually to do with
installation of the OS or drivers, but then people also have issues with
such things on any other version of Windows.  I do know, that issues with
other software aside, Win 98 seems to be one of the best choices for running
EQ.  Despite that, I continue to use Win2k for EQ, as it is so much better
than Win 98 in other regards, such as stability.  Eventually, I anticipate
that I will upgrade to XP, but I'm in no hurry.
