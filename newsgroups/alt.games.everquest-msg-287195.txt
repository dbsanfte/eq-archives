While I shouldn't admit this in an open forum, my... dog, yeah, a 
creature with no legal existance, it was my dog.  Anyway, I, er, he, set 
this up and got ten other people, er, dogs, to set up their own channels 
and make similar invite hotkeys.

We, no they,  all spammed at once, about 80 times in a row, nothing 
happened. (each using a hotkey to do a 5 invite.  Tested this out by 
spamming my bot with it and it does work, no delays pumps out 5 invites 
for each button press and spams them as fast as you can press the button)

I've heard that this trick relies on overwhelming the connection of the 
target, and that it requires a large force to do so (someone said 40+ 
people), and that it only works if the target is on a slow connection, 
perhaps Dial Up, certainly not a T3.

I don't know how good the connection is for the spammers, but I can at 
least report that its better than the spam power of 10 puppies.
