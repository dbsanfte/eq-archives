Hi, I'm the admin of Zebedee MUD.

Firstly for the record let me point out Zebedee is non-profit. Any 
player donations are voluntary and go towards renting server space. 
Typically on a monthly basis, payment is from my own pocket.

Given the competition for online players these days, particularly from 
massive games backed with huge funding such as EQ, it is increasingly 
hard for us to attract new players, so we need to use any medium we can 
to advertise.

I'd like to thank others in this group for their support in particular 
Dave Weller. However I do appreciate Darktyger's complaint - if every 
MUD advertised frequently here in this way, your group would be 
overwhelmed.

As such, for newgroups such as this, where although the topic is 
related, the newsgroup does not exist for advertising, we keep our 
postings to an infrequent basis.

Finally, thanks for the extra publicity we got whilst you argued about 
us. We need it ;)
And if you get bored of EQ, then please try us out.
