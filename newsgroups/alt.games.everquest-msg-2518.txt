Not only do I have some, but I've got 3 of them.
Also I've got other quest items too.
Large Scorpion Pincher
that bag that looks like one of the sack containers (large sack - 6 item
container, or small sack - 4 item container).
the 4 leaf clover thing
charred bone chip
a cracked femur from a high LV skeleton
muck skipper fish (2 or 3 of them - foraged fish)
some NO DROP named fish I caught
That's all I can think of right now, but I've got 4 backpacks (8 slots each)
and 4 sacks (6 slot each) in my bank, only 3 of the slots total are free,
others have stacks of items in them.
