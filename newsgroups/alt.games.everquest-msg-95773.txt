Should be fine.

No.  They share similarities, but some are better/sturdier/easier to mess
with/etc.  Best bet is to go to a place that has a lot of cases on display
and see for yourself.  If not, try: http://www.casedepot.com.

The AMDs burned up because the motherboard manufacturers did not correctly
implement the logic to detect an overheating cpu.  Make sure that any
motherboard you get correctly implements this.

DDR.  Avoid RAMBUS.

I've never understood getting a DVD drive in a computer.  If I want to watch
a movie, I'll do it on the TV, where I can sit in my comfy chair.  But if
it's just as cheap as a CD, go for it.
