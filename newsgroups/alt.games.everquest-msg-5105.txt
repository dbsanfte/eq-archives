A couple of months ago, there was a glitch that took every piece of
inventory from me (8 slots and all bank).  Because of my availability of
play, it took almost a full week before I could get things straightened out
with the GM-Admin.  He 'restored' my character from a backup and any xp I
gained during that week, and items, were gone.  This was still preferable to
trying to scrounge up all new equipment.

Try a little patience.
