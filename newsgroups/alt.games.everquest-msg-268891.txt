Relating to just your original comment, there is nothing stupid about
"gay pride". What made your post stupid was what you preceded it with:
"Not to be homophobic, but...". That clearly implied that there was
some sort of issue there being hinted at... As if it was a bad thing,
and pointing out the association would lead others to believe it's a
bad thing as well.
