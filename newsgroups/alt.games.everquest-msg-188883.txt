You would worship a god who would punish an infant because his parents
didn't join his fan club?  How utterly pathetic. Do you not se the irony
evident as you go on about how miserable your life has been and how it was
all the fault of other people (i.e. your parents, your non_conformist
friend, et.al) and now you turn to the giant, invisible space daddy ?  Same
crutches, different wood.
