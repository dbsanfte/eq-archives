Does anyone have any thoughts about stopping at 55 or so and getting a
few of the better AAs to make yourself more powerful for your level? I
realize that you would get them slower (much slower) than at 65 but
you could use them for hte next 10 levels where you wouldn't have them
otherwise.

That way you can beat mobs at your level or thereabouts and get xp
faster to level faster?  Also means you will be fighting weaker sets
of mobs in LDoN as their level is based on your level regardless of
how many AAs you have.

Thoughts anyone?  Am I missing something here?
