I know that if your Agi is below 75 points you receive an AC penalty. I
wondered if there were any other 'sweet' spots to aim for with Agi, where
you got an AC increase?

If not, would increasing levels of agi help a caster class dodge blows? I'm
wondering about this as I am about to role up an erudite enchanter and put 5
points in agi to boost him to 75. However those points could be potentially
wasted later on with the enc's agi buff and +agi equipment so I'd like to
know if increasing agi actually helps.

Thanks :)
