WOW! So it is not a box when collapsed? AWESOME. Does this mean I can put 
it in a WR bag? As I am a monk, this question is highly imporatant to me :)

Of all the tradeskills, I think tinkering is probably the coolest. No other 
tradeskill (aside fromn Alchemy of course) provides anywhere near that many

By the way, I have a Spyglass. It is cool, but I want something with better 
magnification. Is there such a beast?
