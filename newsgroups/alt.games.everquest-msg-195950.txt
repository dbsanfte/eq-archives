I soloed a rogue for a bit (hahah what a nightmare) around those levels in
solb, pick a zone line from sola to solb and set up camp, with some care
alot of solb can be soloed if you steer clear of the usual train paths. Plus
you'll have a far easier time of it then I did as a rogue with your fd/mend
and better bandaging skills, far less downtime and easier pulls then I had
lol. (Played off hours and was on stormhammer... rogue is hell to solo and
if i could solo her there a monk should have no problems with it). Nice exp
bonus in there.

Other places off the top of my mind, Kael/EW zone line, either in Kael or
the manowars/walrus's outside. If your on Kael faction, and not caring if
you mangle your dwagon faction alot of skyshrine can be soloed at those
levels as well, the basement around the bank is a good area and several
rooms in the upper front half of zone.. steer clear of the back half of zone
and the maze area for a while though!

Unless they have been changed, alot of Neriak guards can be soloed around
those levels as well for decent exp/cash, seens everal guides on good
pulling areas in Neriak, although majority of them are casters guides (only
spot I have ever tried was the very back of  Neriak 3rd gate number 11 area
on the map http://www.eqatlas.com/neriakthirdgatemap.html ) Sadly I can't
recall exactly what lvls I soloed back there as it was quite some time ago,
did it with a barb shammie in either high 40's or low 50's.

Plenty of areas that can be soloed at those lvls and are usually not hunted,
depends on your personal playstyle and skills though, those are by far the
easiest I can think of for the most stress free hunting.
