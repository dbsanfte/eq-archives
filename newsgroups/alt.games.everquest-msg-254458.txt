My understanding is that if you don't worship an Evil god -- and Tribunal
and Mith Marr wouldn't count -- you can't get to non-KOS with the shaman
guild. The shaman guild is in the same building as the beastlord one. And
I'm guessing that like for most other races, the beastlord guild is on the
same faction as shamans. So I wouldn't bother trying with the Barbarian.

I don't know about Rallos Zek. I bet an SK board would have comments about
it under Greenmist quest, since shadowknight guild is in with beastlords
and shamans. And for an Ogre, I'd try the LOIO explorer knife quest for
faction rather than bone chips. Much faster. Blows your FV faction too,
but as you're an Ogre, who'd care?
