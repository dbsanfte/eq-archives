Sounding off against dishonesty means I'm on a high horse? What exactly 
*can* a person denounce and in doing so *not* be considered by you to be on 
a high horse? You might as well get used to walking in horse crap.

Also, who's whining? I'm stating fact. Dishonesty sucks and makes the world 
a worse place. Thanks for sounding off as to which camp *you're* in though.
