I would tend to go with a variation off the Castersrealm
recommendations.

5 points into dex to get it to 75 and then the rest to agi.  At lower
levels agi produces a significant effect on your AC.  It also allows you
to approach the next bonus level(100) for agi and the shaman/ranger buff
kitty feet will put you easily into the next zone.
