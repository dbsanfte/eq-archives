Well, after my post a few days ago, it appears there's hope for us paladins
as posted on the EQ Developer Forum today ...

-----------------

We have reviewed Ghoulbane and SoulFire and will be making some changes to
these items with the next patch.

Ghoulbane will become No Drop and SoulFire will require the proper
Race/Class to activate.
We wanted to make you aware of these changes before we made them. These
weapons are really intended to be holy weapons, and these changes should
make them exclusive to Paladins. We will also be reviewing the quest to make
certain that it is working after the patch.

Alan

---------------

Presume next patch will be next week ....
