Oh, now I've forgotten the name of that classic movie - 
it was supposed to show the evils of marijuana use, but
now is shown as a form of comedy.

Don't for an instant believe that I don't understand the
dangers of drug use in our culture -

- 50% of people who die in accidents while driving passenger cars,
  light trucks, or vans have been drinking
- 30% of fatally injured motorcycle riders have alcohol in their
  systems.
- 50% of fatally injured adult pedestrians have a blood-alcohol
  level of 0.10 or more at the time of their accidents
- 38% of accidental drownings are linked to alcohol
- 35% of fatal falls are alcohol related.
- 45% of fire accidents resulting in death are alcohol related.

Alcohol is also implicated in - 
- Cardiomyopathy
- Cardiac Arrhythmia
- Cancers of the tongue, mouth, esophagus, larynx, and liver.
- Brain cell loss
- Birth defects due to the mother's drinking during pregnancy.

I just feel that criminalizing it represents some of the worst
societal hypocrisy imaginable, and puts a huge burden on our 
society.

Thanks for the references, I'll poke around the library when
summer term is out.
