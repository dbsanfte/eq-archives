Might be good in theory, but my experience with zones such as loio/dl/ot is
that twinks *do* know how to play the game better than new players (big
surprise).Its us (yes im a twink) that has the job of educating them before
they get to KC and start getting people killed. Im playing an enchanter at
the moment, so I had to spend quite some time educating the newbies.
