How true.  I think most of the more aggressive beggars are either veterans
of EQ or other MMORPGs. When I first started in the game, the thought of
just sending a tell to someone and asking for plat or items never occurred
to me. Why would it - I certainly hadn't learned to walk up to people and
beg for stuff in real life.  Being an EQ beggar is a learned behavoir.  I
think most players (not all) have a bit more modesty than to get EQ as their
first on-line game, setup the character, then immediately start panhandling.
