Yeah.  Especially when the difficulty of some of the epics is so far out of
whack compared with the other ones.  And then there's the Ragefire camp,
which is a hell in a class all by itself.

But some of the epics are really worth it.  The cleric rez stick in
particular is so powerful that you have all kinds of anti-social behavior
going on to get it:

Stick an epic-equipped bard in a group with a bunch of tanks, and watch the
swords fly.  But my god the effort for this.  There's a bard on Povar that
stayed at level 52 for months, leading one Vox raid after another to get
that scale.  He finally got it.  He also got damned good at leading Vox
raids.  I went on several, and they all succeeded, except one where some
idiot trained the ice giants onto the clerics from behind.

After repeatedly going OOM hasting tanks on raids, I'm actively pursuing the
enchanter epic.  Only 5 more drops to go, hoping to get 3 of them done by
this weekend.  Then all I have to do is go on a lot of Hate and Fear
raids...  Sigh.
