I would say that honour is a very complicated thing, and really has no place
as an argument here. It is an appeal to the emotions, rather than to the
intellect. Most people consider themselves honourable. I'm fairly certain
that Al Capone would consider himself so.

Some people may believe that they have dishonoured themselves by clicking on
a EULA, and not abiding to it to the exact letter, others may think that
they might only have been slightly naughty. Some might not even read it, and
just click to make the screen go away. I don't think it is a subject to hang
your honour on.

It could be argued that everyone is dishonorable. Simply ask any person
whether they have lied or not. If they say no.... well, you can guess the
rest.

I think that both sides of the "selling on E-bay" thread have some good
arguments, but arguing whether it is honourable to do so isn't one of them.

Dispersion made some very good points, before the thread degenerated into
flames. I would like to see (hear?) some decent points made to counter his.
