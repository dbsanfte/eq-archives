I have tried everything (in my power - called EQ<no help> read boards, asked
questions, changed settings) when I bought the game I exceed the minimum
requirements and yet I either hang in a lag or when it finally does long in
it boots me out.

We I first started (a week or so ago) everyone was having this problem, now
I don't see any mentions of it.

I can't go and change video cards, motherboards, videocards, memory... it
worked the first day I bought it and I can't afford to spend this kind of
money.

After a stressful day the last thing I want to do is get frustrated by a
game - lol I want to kill things.

I will have to call EQ today and cancel my account I just know it... :-(
Anyone out if you can help I will wait with the call.

Thanks in Advance!
