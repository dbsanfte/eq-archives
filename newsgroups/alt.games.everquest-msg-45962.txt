Yup - they've been sucky rogues.  If I'm not actively evading I can
out-taunt a same-level warrior or monk through sheer damage.  Problem with
Rogues is their absolute dependence on equipment and groups.  If I don't
have a decent piercer (not just 'weapon') in hand, I do pitiful damage.
Rogues in toe-to-toe melee (ie soloing or main tank) do approximately 30%
less damage through lost backstabs.  HP are low to balance our damage (no
complaint there, makes sense to me).
All in all, I think rogues are a *very* well balanced class.  Only thing I'd
like to see added would be *some* kind of "escape mechanism" (for lack of a
better description).  Other classes have different edges (high HP/AC,
self-sow, evac, FD, etc).  My idea would be some weak chance at a Mem Blur
(ie FD) when a successful evade is done well outside of the mob's agro
range.  Thus, it wouldn't work within melee range and would require that the
rogue got a decent head start, paused for lag, Hide.  This would paralled a
"complete Hide in Shadows" and, like Evade, would only be good for a single
target.
