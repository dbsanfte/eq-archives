One thing that has worked for me on occasions has been to kill the tower
spawn this could be a skelly, zombie or just about anything i think but
killing this "seems" to spawn either the little sand giant whoes name i cant
remember, a sand giant, a sand mummy, terrorantula or the ancient cyclops. I
am not saying this is his definate ph but it may be one of a chain and i
have got lucky on a few occasions but its worth a try.
