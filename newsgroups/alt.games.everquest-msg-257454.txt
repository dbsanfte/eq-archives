Windows XP, 2 different machines (depending on which one wife snags to play
on), one with ATI card one with nVidia, both 512M RAM, never have trouble in
windowed mode unless the screen saver goes off.
I can alt-tab to my browser, editor (though I have not figured out how to
get new hotkeys to load without restarting character), etc. I obviously had
to use the windows compatibility toolkit but all is good.

Note a couple of things, the mouse does disapear and not show up until I tab
back into EQ if I tab out while zoning or logging in a character.
