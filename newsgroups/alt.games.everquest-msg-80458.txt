Uh-oh, I'm on a roll, this might get long!

So here's the deal, I've convinced my friends that the great outdoors
is boring and sun is bad for you, and we've started hitting dungeons
fulltime. Today was our first day and we went to Cazic to test the
waters, as it were. We're four RL friends; cleric, warrior, wizard and
shadow knight, all in our 30s. We had great fun in Cazic, ported in
and just started laying waste to the place, and the casters discovered
the joy of AoE spells.

We hit a couple snags though, not least of which was my beatiful troll
body getting stuck in the Archon pyramid. In the confusion, the SK fell
down to the alligator pits and got eaten while I waited for a GM to
unclog the drains. Guess I should've let the wizard port us back to the
maze in hindsight, but I was worried that the spell wouldn't have taken
since I was technically in water when I was stuck...

Anyway, I pulled the SK to the zone line, we rezzed him, and kept at it.
Ooh, a fatty warrior pulling a corpse through the alligator caves, that
was fun, in a heart-pounding terror kinda way... We decided to try to
pull the Avatar, and got the entire room of course, and had to evac out.
Gee, wonder if a crowd controller could've been of use there? Naaah...

So, question time!

1) We went to Cazic hoping to get some of the SK armor quest drops, but
didn't find any crusaders or whatever's supposed to drop that stuff. We
will be returning though, so if anyone has any pointers for finding the
suckers, I'd be grateful and stuff.

2) We're outgrowing Cazic! Any suggestions for replacement dungeons are
welcome too! Old-world and Kunark only, please, the SK doesn't have SoV,
and none of us have gotten SoL yet. My thoughts so far: Kaesora (hard
without crowd control?), Lower Guk (any suggestions for camps we can
handle?), Mistmoore (real hard without CC), and Dalnir (or have we
already outgrown that?). I'd really like to go get some EE bags for us
in LGuk at least, we should be able to do that easily, right? Right?

3) Phat lewts. Got any? No, wait, that's not what I meant to say. Which
level-appropriate dungeon would you go to if you wanted mucho moolah and
nice trinkets? Naw, scratch mucho moolah, just nice trinkets for mostly
untwinked or moderately twinked players.

4) In your opinion, how much longer can we keep doing this without crowd
control? Another friend of mine is currently playing a bard twink, but
he was level 26 last I checked, and won't be much help. Since we're
hitting level-appropriate places, we can't single-pull, so the chances
of a TPW-size train are pretty big.

5) If you're a shaman on AB, I'm on the lookout for shrink potions in a
big way! Or diet pills, whichever works.
