Aw, he's mad. How cute. :-)

All of which are unintentional or random changes, which means you (of
course) missed the point.

*cough*

Apparently not only are you poor at understanding other people's
posts, you have trouble with your own. Much is explained....

Ironically, I'm probably ten times the writer you are. *shrug* I can,
at least, understand the usefulness of emoticons rather than dismiss
them outright in some pompous display of superiority.

You mean, "that expression of emotion annoys me to no end, so much
that I have to behave like Winchester from MASH on his worst day"...

How droll. *rolls eyes*

Are you now claiming you're not being pompous? Do you even understand
what you are posting or are you just flaming randomly hoping one will
stick?

Go back to school, kid. You missed a lesson or two.
