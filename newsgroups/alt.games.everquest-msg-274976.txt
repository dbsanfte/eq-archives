Actually, I believe the primary reason for expansions was to have a
physical box to put on store shelves and generate new customers. It
also makes EQ look vibrant and prospering if new expansions are still
being developed, rather than it being "that old game that came out 5
years ago".

There are fluff games that are fun and fairly forgettable, and there
are challenging games that can often be frustrating, yet still provide
more exciting moments than the fluff games. Early EQ had more of the
latter, but I agree that failing to keep the game vibrant forced the
developers to instead eliminate frustrations in order to keep people
interested.

EQ, for better or worse, raised my standards for MMO games to the
extent that none of the current crop can meet them. Ironically, much of
that was a result of what EQ didn't do, as much as what it did do.
