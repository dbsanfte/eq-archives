The trick to not getting aggro between mobs in OT is simple; pull
out to the walls and med there.  No wanderers, no roamers, no
nothing.  Pulls are a bit longer of course, but thats the price
you pay.  Alternative would be to Hide to med, if you happen to
be a race/class with hide.

Not Knights or Berserkers, and if you are killing sarnaks in OT
as opposed to HG in RM for exp, then those are what you are
pulling.  You'd have to go way out of your way to get anything
else.  And there are other other mobs, sabretooths, cactus,
rhinos that you can also chew thru.  HG, everything else you kill
is a green (or maybe cyan) placeholder, very annoying
