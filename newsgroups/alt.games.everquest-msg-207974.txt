According to an article in the July 12, 2003 edition of London's "The
Guardian" newspaper, the government of Thailand has become concerned
about the rise in on-line game addiction (in particular, a Korean
on-line game called Ragnarok Online which is popular in Thailand).
They plan to introduce a curfew preventing players from using games
servers between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., as well as curbing the business
hours of Internet cafes, for a trial period starting tomorrow, July
15, and lasting till September 30.  EQ is also mentioned in the
article.
