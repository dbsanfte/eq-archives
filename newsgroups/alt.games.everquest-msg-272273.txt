Pretty much. As a Paladin, I have slightly fewer aggro-holding
abilities but more buffing, healing, and 'I take damage when you get
hit' abilities. The new training options allowed me to buff up my
taunt and nuke to increase aggro, so I can hold it better...I did that
because I usually am MT in my guild hunting groups. If I wasn't, I'd
have buffed damage or my self-buffs.
