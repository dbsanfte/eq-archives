That is the thing about role play. If you stop and think about it, the
character that you create is an alter ego, or another persona. While you
control him/her; you really try to act and respond as the charater would in
the environment and context that you created it. As such, it really is
another persona from you so I think it is fine to refer to your character in
third person. To get involved to the point of refering to a character/alter
ego in first person would, by extension, be much more worrying as that could
indicate some reality blur...

My 2 cents anyway and I am sticking with it :)
