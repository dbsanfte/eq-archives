I don't know - tough call. If it were a server problem, wouldn't
everyone on that server be having the problem? I find it easier to
believe that there are several ISPs flaking out out there (or a few
major pipelines sending you hopping through some crazy routing treks)
than the possibility that there is a problem on the server which only
affects a small percentage of users. Someone had posted a link at some
point a while back that would take you to a page where you could view
the activity on the largest internet pipelines at any given time. I
visited it once and was surprised at the number of red lights
indicating packet-loss or collisions or some such on several of them.

All just food for thought though. I'm not currently having any trouble
with it.
