Erudite Enchanter.

If you want some of the cultural armors and weapons then you have little
choice on the race, or class if you want to be self sufficient, but other
than that, Erudite Enchanter gives you the highest combinations of (INT or
WIS) and CHA.  You can start a High Elf with better CHA, and thus get better
prices, but you will not skill up as fast, asn the Erudite will have the
highest possible starting (INT or WIS).

Of course, you may find it boring to play 8 Erudite Enchanters.
