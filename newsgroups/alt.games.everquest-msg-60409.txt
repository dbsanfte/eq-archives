Try this: 

After trying stuff like they suggested such as the bios updates which
might be the best way to solve the problem, see if their is already a
direct X or other updates for XP. Also there may be new nvidia drivers
for XP, in fact I know the newest geforce one is 2.813 or something
(go to the nvidia site and get them) Upgrade the video and sound
drivers after the newest direct x 8.1.  

Then if it STILL doesn't work make an empty file in notepad called:

nosound.txt 

and drop it into your EQ dir. Not sure what you mean by "running EQ
with no sound" but that is the only way to do it where it would be
helping. 
Outside of XP your system should be great for EQ, probably even
Luclin.

Then as a LAST resort, install just enough of win98 to multiboot or
something if you still have it.(put it in a totally seperate folder..
or even partition if you have one) You should be able to then upgrade
to kunark from 98 or rather make your new account (EQ does not have to
be OS installed at all, in fact after once installing up through
velious I just burned my entire EQ dir onto a couple CDROMS, then just
dump them into a dir after I reformat my drive, highlight all files
and click off "read only" (something the coming from a CD does) and I
can immediately play EQ again) then play in XP once that works if the
only problem was something that happened when hitting make new
account.

It should just have better XP support when it goes to a direct X 8
engine. I'm sure they've tested Luclin with XP.

I have up to velious running great on mine with the newest nvdia
drivers from:

www.nvidia.com

the newest direct x 8.1 from:

www.microsoft.com/directx

And I'm in original 98 fully upgraded via windows update and with only
a p2 400 and a tnt 16 meg agp and 128 meg ram, I have no problems.
