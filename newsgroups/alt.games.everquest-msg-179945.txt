Geforce 2 mmx. Driver date november 2002

Ever since the last patch i get random white flashes. I have made sure i
have the latest driver for my video card, and have no problems with other
games. It happens when the pc is just turned on, or on for hours, and i can
just be staring at my own feet and get it. At least the desktop icons are
gone. It's very annoying.

I contacted eq tech support and they were as useful as they have ever been.
I reported it as a bug and hadd no response. Any ideas? How do i make sure
it's a video card problem, or is it an eq problem? I talked to someone else
with the same issue but i couldn't find out what sort of video card he had.
