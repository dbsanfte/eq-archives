Since it's most likely that you're trying to get a Shadowed
Rapier for the JBoots quest, and since any Shadowed Man camp
is pretty much the same as any other, I'll mention that
there's one at the south end of South Karana.  If you hunt
there, you'll have a pretty short trot over to Rathe Mountains
in order to find Hasten Bootstrutter for the final turn-in.

If you have a Druid handy, on the other hand, the WC camp
seems to have a few more spawns.  Once you get the Rapier
you can be ported to the druid rings in Feerrott, which is
even closer to Rathe Mountains.
