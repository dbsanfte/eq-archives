Got Luclin loaded around 1:00pm cst, waited till around 4:00pm before the
patcher started to patch.  After rebooting 3 times, patching was finished
around 6:00pm cst for me.  I logged into WC and noticed the old world looked
pretty fresh with the new skins installed.   I headed out to NK at a run
since there were just 2 others in WC at the time. It was QUIET.  No OOC, AUC
or SHOUT.  Only 1 guildy was on with me and he was in DL at the wizard
spire.  Made it to NK and waited at the wizzy spire for my port to Luclin.
There is a new NPC there you hail to get a free port stone.   With the port
stone on your person, you will be ported to Luclin approx. every 45 min.
The zone announces a countdown at 5min, 3 min and 1 min before port.

Made it to Luclin and zoned into the Nexus. Nexus is the "arrival depot"
into luclin.  No mobs and 4 exits leading to different parts of Luclin,
There are also portals out of the Nexus porting to all four Norrathian
continents excluding Velious.  Adjacent to the Nexus is the Bazaar.  A
no-MOB trading and commerce zone.  Has two! banks with 4 bankers each and
about every type of item you could want to buy.  Even saw coffins and
reagents next to bank.  There, you can buy horses.  I priced them from 10k
to 123k (123,000 plat for the newb's like me).   Off the south end of the
Bazaar is Shadowhaven.  This is a huge town filled with merchants, trainers,
skills and has zones to two Mob zones.

My first task was to move out.  I headed at a dead SOW run out of
Shadowhaven and into PC, where I wound my way up north and into the newbie
zone adjacent to the Vah Shir city.   I entered the kitty city to find only
two others there, both low level kitties.  I found them and gave them each
10pp as seed money and wished them the best.   The said that I was the first
Norratian to make it that far too. :-).   I took an alternate route out and
after a few new zones, made it back to Shadowhaven where I finally
remembered to get bound. (DOH!).    There I met up with a guildy and two
more and we headed to Echo Caves to hunt.   Most where light blue and blue,
easy kills at level 52.  We found a "named" snake spawn and killed him,
Dropped a fair face item and a range slot mana item.  We also discovered the
zone to "the Deep".   We entered "The Deep" and con'd two mushrooms at the
zone in as blue.  We decided to give them a whirl and the 54 sk pulled them.
DOH! hit for 130's and cast dd's on us. I saw the SK run to zone and turned
around myself.  Standing where my guildy was was a BIG MOB!   I ran and
zoned myself.   I arrived back in ECaves with the SK and wondered where my
guildy shaman was.  He zoned in almost dead and said "thanks for waiting for
me!"  I said "thought you had zoned already and where did that BIG one come
from?"      "that was me!" he answered.  He said he had be hit with a spell
that changed him into a mob, removed ALL his shaman buffs and Rooted him.
The other  two mobs then started beating on him while we had zoned.   He
eventually broke the "illusion"? and was able to zone! wow.

Our shaman had to camp so the SK and I decided to head out and explore some
other zones.  We headed to that zone south of PC if you have seen the atlas
maps and poked into that "Unknown Zone" zone listed on the atlas map.  Never
made it to the zone as that corridor was filled with lava and the mobs there
KILLED me. Doh! I was stupid, 7 mobs, all blue to me, I conned 6 of them as
indif and the hidden 7th "Master" argo'd me and the others joined in.   The
SK was able to drag me away and later, I managed to lead a cleric out to the
frontier to rez me.  Such be the life of dumb explorers.

In summary...

I had a blast for about 6 hours.

Saw the sky with Norrath filling a good portion of it (AWESOME).

 Zone times were horrible (I have ALL extras set to load).

 Lag was bad in the city but was ok in the Mob zones.

New character appearances are GREAT!  didn't miss the old ones a bit.  Even
got the change my face, options for beard style, color, hair style, color,
face style and eye color.

Other than the hell patch, loved it.
