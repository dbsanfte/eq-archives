One time when we were hunting in Umbral, one of the named spawned.   It
dropped a pretty nice helm, which was a small upgrade for me.

I put the helm on, and learned that it was a very pale *pink*.  Not only did
I not wear it... I gave it to the troll warrior in the group next to us ; )
He wore it for about 8 months, and I'm still wearing the helm I had before
it dropped. ; )
