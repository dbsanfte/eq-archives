/role toggles roleplaying.  It does nothing except turn your name purple and
hide your level and class.  And let other roleplayers know that they can spout
ye nonsens olde englishe at you :)

You can turn it on or off as often as you like.  It doesn't affect
communication at all - they were either afk or just not paying attention.

This applies to EQ1 as well as EQ2, by the way.
