At a certain point it stops calculating damage and just says you died (20k).
As to why he didnt and you did - there is something of a bug or poor method
of calculating damage.  Instead of using distance fallen, the code relies on
time falling at full speed.  So if you have a bit of lag it can be a longer
fall and more damage.  A second possibility is that the bst was a cat.  All
