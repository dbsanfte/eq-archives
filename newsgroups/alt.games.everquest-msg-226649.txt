An excellent response from Lance - couple of bits I'd add

Summoned Pet
This is excellent for farming greens!  Whether its for pp, quest items
or tradeskill components a dual wielding animation is very handy.  I
use mine a lot (AE2 helps as I dont need to get hit first), if I cant
blag some summoned items from a mag for him I generally just bung hin
a couple of whatever junk weapons I can find (FS or something like
that).  The pet regens very quickly so a couple of handy tips - to get
argo off the pet wander into range of the mob - it'll always turn to
you then your rune can take some damage off the pet.  I generally
melee back as my staff procs 400dd reasonably regularly with 270 dex
(self buffs only).  To get the pet off altogeather just mez the mob,
let the pet regen then break it & start again. A summoned pet with NDT
& SoV i'm told is doing about 30 - 40 dps.  Max hits are 60.

DC Pet 
These are less attractive than they used to be since the introduction
of PoP.  Used to be excellent for soloing but less attractive these
days as the level difference between pet & mobs is generally too great
to be effective.  There are still some places where I use them,
although unless I'm farming this tends to be to assist the group dps
rather than for soloing.  There are nice giants to be had in Kael for
farming the arena (not done that in a long time!) & the lessers in BoT
are great pets too.  Max hits are around 150 - 160 from these.

Charmed Pet
High Risk High Reward stratagy.  This is where the serious exp is to
be had, despite being hit with the nerf bat some little time ago. 
Theres many stratergies as to the best way to opperate with a charmed
pet, whether to keep one pet for some time or take a new pet from each
encounter.  The latter does result in more exp per kill but can lead
to longer between kills.  The former has a higher risk involvement. 
There are a few goldern rules to remember whichever way you go:

1 You will die along the way - dont believe anyone who tells you
otherwise so don't let it come as a shock!

2 Always do at least 1pt damage to the target.  That way you get
2/3rds of the exp from the mob.  If you want 100% you have to either
out damage the pet - if you could do that why are you charming! - or
kill your pet before it kills the target mob.  This involves a lot of
messing around with invis, mez & nuking - personally I dont bother.

3 Always have the target mob rooted & stand well back - when charm
breaks its easier to deal with 1 angry mob than 2.

4 use SoW/SoE/Greater Wolf Form/Illusion Scale Wolf - anything to let
you outrun the mob!

There are some awesome mobs to be had using this method.  I managed to
out damage the top 2 group members combined with my pet in HoH the
other day (guard mob from by the hohb zone) he was one of the better
pets I've had, hitting for over 500 a go.
