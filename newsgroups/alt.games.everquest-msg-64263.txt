Subject: Since we're all bored waiting for EQ to come back up....

....i have two questions:

1. What's the most damage you've ever seen inflicted with one attack by a
Player? The most I've seen so far is about 13000 damage, by a high level Rogue
who backstabbed a guard in Freeport.

2. Are there any weapons that have a greater chance of scoring a critical hit
than other weapons? 


Can't wait for EQ to come back up; I need to go buy Scent of Dusk and Leach for
my L12 Necro!
