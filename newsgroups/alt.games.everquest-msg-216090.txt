But I never liked grinding at all.  Anything that makes that a little bit
faster paced is fine with me.  If I want a challenge I'll go hang out in
PoP.  Or maybe set an adventure on hard, though the jump from normal to hard
at 65 is rather intense and not kind to the 3 monk, shaman, wizard, bard
(and other assorted "bad" groups) throw together groups you can do the
normal adventures with.
