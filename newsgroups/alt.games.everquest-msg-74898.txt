Not that your questions aid at all in my initial post, but just so you can
sleep tonight, here goes:

1 - I started playing eq when it first came out
2 - I quit eq shortly after purchasing the first expansion (Ruins of
Karnark)
3 - I just started up again several weeks ago before the release of SoL.
4 - Re playing to 45 and not knowing about drop spells.  Well, I would say
that 95% of my class spells are vendor purchased, so there are in fact quite
a few clerics who do not know where these are dropping.

So, in the year I took off, that 2nd expansion has been released of which
I've heard no mention except once in a conversation as to where a fellow
cleric found his celestial healing spell.

Pleasant dreams.
