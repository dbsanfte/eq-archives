Nice, you'll notice the bit where HE offered YOU and not the other way
around, you didn't take advantage of his situation, he was obviously
desperate to sell it and you, asking to buy low end items for 20pp, are
obviously not a twink.

Nope, I've seen level 9 Warriors with Lammys and Cobalt, you paid for that
item yourself, you are not a twink, as the rest of your equipment shows.

Where is and enjoy it, after selling this do you think he's sitting there
thinking damn, I lost out on 60pp? Not likely he's prolly feeling good that
it went to a non twink who's working their way up from the bottom (like he
had to, once) and wondering if maybe he shouldn't have just given it to you.

CF
Much better he sells to you cheaply than to someone like me who'd sell it on
at a profit
