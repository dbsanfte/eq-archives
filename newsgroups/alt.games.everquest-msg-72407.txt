Point taken, however i was merely stating that i have the mana regen of
clarity anyway, since Dennis made a point that i needed to spend time
looking for Clarity, but i dont.  This is certainly not "needed" to solo
effeciently, but is always just "nice" to have.  As i have stated elsewhere
it is viable for a wizard to quad kite from level 16 upto level 60, by
choosing outdoor zones and finding the mobs that best fit the quad kiting
criteria.
