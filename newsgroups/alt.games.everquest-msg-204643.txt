Yeah but it is more different than just having static mobs. Diablo
stayed fresh for as long as that type of game could. The key is
randomizing it enough, such as the way SWG is saying hotspots all over
the maps will make up enounters based on the number/levels in your
group. If you then take further steps like having the hotspots
continually move, you have a lot more randomness than "lets go to that
big tree over there and kill the level 35 thing that will spawn after
we kill the 4 placeholders loads of times."

Diablo is also a good example of non static loot. If you have non
static loot, randomizing it by having it take several possibles off of
a table, dropping from non static mobs you really increase randomness.
You then have people going out to aventure "wherever" and kill
"whatever" to see what happens. Anything they don't need can be
traded/sold for things other people find. Diablo did this well enough
on a small scale to really make me think about how it could be in an
mmorpg.

Yeah that is the problem, it becomes an economic problem. They need
LOTS of money and man hours to essentially come out with an entire add
on game every six months, which they then sell to recoup those man
hours. That leaves precious few "free" man hours left to totally
revamp old zones so they still fresh. Static design is just to hard to
keep redoing. Nothing would satisfy me except changing content
constantly, which would be impossible if it is static unless every
couple of months every user paid 35 more dollars to have general
content upgraded, without getting so much as a box. I don't see them
doing that. As it is now SO much of the old zones end up being dead
air.

Perhaps a mostly random mix of the two would be good, so they'd still 
mad more add on areas every few months to sell but old content would
be continually fresh. I just found it very odd that someone would say
"not static enough. " I think he needed to quantify that more, like
how?
