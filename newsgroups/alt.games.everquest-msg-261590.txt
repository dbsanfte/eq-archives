Gotta have a good computer to do this in FV.  Not quite as hard in OT.

Where?  In Kunark?  The land of no bats?   =)

Granted this is being devil's advocate (as I can run straight through either
town and then stand and take the beating, I always was), that requires
another expansion.  The reality is you could stand there for a while and
eventually catch a wizard or druid coming through (probably...  DL doesn't
get the traffic it used to).

I'll add my emphasis to this.  It's not impossible, but by the time you were
un-KOS in FV, you'd either be level 60 or be level 30 and have been killing
greens for weeks.  =)
