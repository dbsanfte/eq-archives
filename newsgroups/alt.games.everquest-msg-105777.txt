Thanks for trying it, I am very happy to be wrong. Unless you are part
of the "Vast Verant Conspiricy(tm)" :-)

I moved it to my on hand and put away the CG I had. I whipped a mummy
and an orc raider both times I got a "your will is not suff" at 20
(rogue). Before it proc-ed at 20, not it doesn.t You say it procced at
27, maybe 25.

Who else has one and when did it proc? Can we fix the proc level?
