Well, of course.

If you had infinite time to fix bugs, programs would be released
bug-free.

You don't. And there's a constant pressure, esp. in MMORPGs, to add
new features (which means new bugs) all the time.

If you're waiting for a bug-free game, you'll be waiting a long, long,
time.

I just said in an earlier post: Every product you buy was shipped with
a list of 'known bugs' on some developers desk. It was determined that
it was 'good enough', and that was that.
