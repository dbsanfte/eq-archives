A few days ago Interplay's Black Isle Studios division permanently
closed its doors. Black Isle debuted in 1997 with the ground-breaking
role-playing game Fallout, and proceeded to single-handedly revitalize
the RPG genre with huge hits like Baldur's Gate, as well as classics
like Planescape: Torment. As part of the studio's closure, its
yet-announced Fallout 3 project was canceled. So, a moment of silence,
if you please.
