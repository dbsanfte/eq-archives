As if finding out that Goblin Traitor and Angry Goblin are not infact in
FM like some said they would be, but are now in a 50-65 zone with what are
probably see-invis mobs (just got to warmly with chardok last night), I
now have to face the fact that I may not have a snowball's chance in hell
of getting at least Rak's 7th cudgel before they rape Charasis (only
rumour I've heard said 60-65 zone...which could be wrong, but gives me
ulcers nonetheless), nevermind his 8th cudgel.

I need to find me a nice china shop right now...*hefts amy war
staff*  I just hope no coworkers give me grief before I get this
frustration outta my system.
