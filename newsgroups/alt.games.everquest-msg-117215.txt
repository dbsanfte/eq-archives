 It's kinda hard to see that as being the case here. Did the cleric
never get any loot or just not that particular item? No idea. To me it
sounded like the cleric wanted the item, thought she deserved it, and
deguilded in a huff when she wasn't awarded it. Like the other person
said, "Good riddance." However, if I put in the time, attended the
majority of raids, and saw the majority of the loot going to the same
group of people, I'd more than likely look for a new guild. I wouldn't
consider that lootwhoring.

 Sounds to me like people don't trust your officers to make the proper
decisions. We've been awarding for at least two years now. We have had
our share of loot disputes but just about every guild does. People
quitting EQ has had a much larger impact on our guild than the
occassional loot dispute ever did.

 I'd have a talk with them and say they either up their attendance rate
for guild raids or they find another guild.
