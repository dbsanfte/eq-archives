Run fast.  :b

The entrance to CC is located on the far side of the keep from the 
entrance.  You run around the building, inside the walls to the back, you 
will see a building in back with a gate, open the gate, and click on the 
crystal inside the building, and you will be in CC.  Don't know about your 
faction standing with the dwarves inside CC, but, in order to get to them, 
you will have to go through a lot of Rygor first.

Easiest way to get in is to invis first.  Bring a Cloudy Potion, purchased 
at any one of a number of vendors, or bring a friend that can invis you.  
None of the Rygorr see through invis.  At least none of the ones outside 
the main building there.
