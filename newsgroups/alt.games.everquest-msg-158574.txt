Any heal at all can be the difference between a tank dead with his CHeal hitting
just after he's gone, and a live fully healed tank.  Anyone with a heal should at
least be thinking about healing the MA when you notice his HP bar has dropped
below half a bubble.  Rangers, necromancers, I dont' care who you are or how
crappy your heal looks, we just need another second of life!

A smart cleric will already know better than to heal a necro or shaman unless he
has nothing better to do.  If things are going bad, heck, I'll let you die.  If
they aren't, I'll assume you are LHP on purpose, probably until too late!
Setting a threshold helps a lot, if someone says "I never drain my hp to lower
than 60%" then I know to watch for you to cross that magic line and consider
healing if convenient (which means the group is better off with you living so we
don't have to rez you and buff you back up... and the chanter and MT are not
going to get killed because I was paying attention to you)

On the other hand, I very often do heal necros and shaman... if I'm FM, there is
no more mana efficient spell in my book than my heals.  I can "transfer mana" to
you by slapping a HOT on you and med it back up fairly quickly.  I call this
"reverse mana pump" and it can be very effective, much more so than me directly
nuking mobs, for example.
