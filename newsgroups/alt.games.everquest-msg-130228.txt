I've been amusing myself by keeping score of ABC radio news --
the one that plays at the top of the hour on some radio stations.

They're savvy enough not to exhibit *too* obvious a bias
(that would lose them syndication subscriptions), but they
still work it into their broadcasts in subtle (perhaps
even unintentional) ways.

My favorite is that throughout most of the Clinton administration
their coverage of some new presidential initiative was of
the form:

   "The White House today proposed..." (often with presidential soundbites)

   [followed only about 50% of the time by:]
   "Republicans said it stinks"   (or somesuch)

The other 50% of the time they didn't even present the
opposition's complaint at all.  And even when they did, the
counterpoint was usually tersely paraphrased instead of letting
the Republicans have their own soundbites.

So then Bush gets elected, and the form changed to:

   "Democrats objected to today's White House initiative."
   [Soundbite of Daschle or Gephardt declaring that Bush
   was about to commit cannibalism or whatever]

   [...followed by finally describing or soundbiting
   the new proposal, as if as an afterthought.]

Um...  Since when did political rebuttals *lead* the news,
followed by the actual story the rebuttal was responding
to?

ABC radio news also sometimes uses the traditional "story,
then counterpoint' ordering, but it's amazing how often
they do the "rebuttal first" style.  It stands out like
a sore thumb, and they *never* did it under Clinton's
tenure.

It's as if no matter who's in charge, the writers at
ABC consider Democrats to have the Most Important
thing to say, and the Republicans have the
Barely Worth Mentioning (or We'd Rather People Not
Hear This) viewpoint.

NPR is famous for this sort of thing too.

I haven't read it yet, but Ann Coulter's new book,
"Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right"
is reportedly chock-full of similar well-documented
examples.  And like her last book and her various
written columns, it's bound to be hilarious and witty
even while it covers serious topics.  My favorite
Ann Coulter passage was written in regard to
the left's disapproval of the war in Afghanistan
against the Taliban/Al Qaeda:

  "We've finally given liberals a war against 
  fundamentalism, and they don't want to 
  fight it.  They would, except it would put 
  them on the same side as the United States." 

Hilarious, sarcastic, *and* trenchant.
