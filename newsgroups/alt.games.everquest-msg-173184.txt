I've heard that Bin Laden hates Arafat for talking peace with the Jews in
Israel.  I've heard he hates the Saudi royal family for allowing the U.S. to
maintain bases on Saudi soil.  But I have never seen the claim until just

> No...I dont see the connection.

And yet, they have more oil than Iraq.  Which is it then, we attack Iraq for
oil or we *don't* attack Saudi Arabia because of oil.  The oil argument is a
feeble one.
