I'm sorry, were you under the impression it was a copyright issue?  It
may be, but I never mentioned it as such.  If on the other hand you came
into possession of that data because you were a part of the guide
program then it was a violation of your own personal honor to break your
agreement not to distribute it if nothing more.  If you read my post you
may find that was what I was saying, that doing so  is not only
inherently immoral, but also a detriment to the playing community.

Again, sorry if you thought that was a legal judgment, it wasn't.  It
was a moral judgment in which you were rightly condemned for your acts
against the players of EQ.  Your self serving aggrandizement can lead
only to additional burden  on the guide staff by those who love ever so
much to play rules lawyer.  Something I have a feeling you are quite
familiar with based on your claims regarding copyrights in this post.

Answered above but in case you weren't able to figure it out I'll put it
in very simple terms.  RULES LAWYERS.

What a crock of shit this is.  VI may terminate your rights to access
the game at any time for any reason, you agreed to that when  you first
played the game.  Though if you agreed not to  distribute the guide
manual I guess we have seen that your word means little.  In further
response to this tripe I would like to say that some things that come to
mind are Captain Crunch, baby kittens, SPF13 and the 16th amendment to
the constitution.

Do you use a shovel to apply this or just back the spreader up and drop
the load?
