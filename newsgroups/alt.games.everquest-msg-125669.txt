Nope. If they truly believe it is the right thing to do - not just
being a coward - then I don't see where that is offensive. Besides,
they are not strolling into the homes of those who may be offended and
proclaiming their passivism.

Only when done under the noses of those who find it offensive.
 
> People who eat beef are wrong?

Again, only when done under the noses of those who find if offensive.

Don't try to make it a more complicated issue than it is. You wouldn't
drop trou and take a dump in the middle of a pre-school playground
would you? I mean, everyone craps - it is a natural thing to do, but
it is offensive and just one of those things everyone knows would be
wrong to do without having to be told.

Sure, if you are an anarchist. It seems that it's much easier to do
what you want under the justification that it's incorrectness/rudeness
cannot be objectively qualified. Rest assured, we may as well throw
the whole notion of world peace out the window with that attitude.
It's selfish. "I don't care if it bothers you, there is no reason it
should, so I'm going to do it anyway."

Like I said, it's not so difficult a concept to grasp.
