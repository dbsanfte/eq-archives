As a relative low level character I was hanging around the Qeynos gates a
few weeks back and I saw ahuge number of high level folks doing all sorts of
bizarre things. One character had changed into some sort of semi-bipedal
werewolf ( at least that's what it looked like )

Anyone know what the name of this spell is and what class it belongs to?
Just curious really.

Thanks in advance
