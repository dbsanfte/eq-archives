I think it would be better if buffs had a "recommended level" not unlike
weapons, rather than level restrictions. That way you could drop a KEI on a
lvl 22 char, but they'd only get 7.5 regen per tick instead of the 15. Same
with Temp - Cleric gets it at 44, so make that the recommended level. Cast
it on a 22, you get 400 HP and 24 AC instead of 800/48.

Could take it further, and have required levels at the level at which the
caster receives the buff - SoW 14, Breeze 16, Clarity 29, Temp 44 etc.

That would go along way towards making people fight with buffs appropriate
to their level (heaven forbid casters learn mana conservation) and likewise
people could do LDoNs where there might actually be some risk involved,
rather than not going in until they've got a Temp and completing a normal in
30 minutes.

It would also, unfortunately, cause so much whinage the game would become
unplayable.
