Tell me I am missing a joke here and you really don't think that it's DT's
responsibility to help newbie guilds.

We had a, new, member who kept asking how does he become a "leader" means
officer. Tactfully, he was told by one officer that there were not enough
members to warrant any more officers and then less tactfully told he's not
going to become one because he wants it to much (kinda what everyone was
thinking, just no one wanted to say it)
