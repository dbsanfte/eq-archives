Lich in the bazaar? This isn't the Gimp and Chimp we're talking about here.
Though I guess I could see it happening. Actually the more I think about it
the more likely it's happened repeatedly.


BTW: That reminds me of the guy that /ooc'd to zone he could stay alive in
skellie form longer than anyone else, and would bet 500pp on that fact.

I give him some credit, he gave me the money when my enchanter outlasted
him.

Silly gnecro.
