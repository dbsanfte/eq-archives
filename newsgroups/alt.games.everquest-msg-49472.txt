Considering you can get a character to 50 in about 1/4 the time, it
makes sense.   Its not like everyone is hanging out in Guk anymore. We
are chain pulling big xp mobs in risk free groups.  I barely even
remember lvl 30 to 45 on my cleric, took about 3 weeks.  45 on the
other hand was a bear. :)

compare this to 2 weeks to get thru lvl 35 on my pre-kunark enchanter

side thought - Anyone remember when we couldn't rearrange spells in
spell book?  that sucked.
