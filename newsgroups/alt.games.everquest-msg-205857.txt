What does this message mean?  I'm an almost lvl 21 Shaman and it seems when 
I'm chasing a mob or having a mob chasing me I stop, cast and then get the 
interrupted message.  The mob is still too far away to hit me.  Or if it's not 
even trying to attack me I still get the interrupted message.  Seems I have to 
cast most of my spells at least twice before they even work.  What could it be 
that is interrupting my casting?  It almost seems I've got a better chance of 
my spells working if a mob is actually beating on me.
