If I have trouble logging in, before, I would load up my server
scanner. If it's peak hours, and all the servers are down below 1000,
I know there's a problem and I should wait before trying to log in
again. I've talked to guides who say they check the population of
their server before logging in to decide whether to go into their play
account or pop in and see if they're needed on their guide server. The
guides can't even see the server pops anymore now...
