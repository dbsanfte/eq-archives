First, remember this:  The reason that some people on EQ act
twelve years old is often because they *are* twelve years old.

Next, several times you directed your complaints in the
direction of people with "high levels".  But in my experience,
there are dickheads at every level.  There's nothing special
about high-level twits versus low-level twits.  A high-level
jerk is just a low-level jerk who has played the game 6-12
months longer.

Finally, as a "high level" myself, I've gotten more than my
share of grief from "low level" people who think that just
because I've got a few more levels, I'm somehow *less* entitled
to some parts of the game than they are.  Sure, I may not get
exp from certain kills, but that doesn't mean that I don't
have a legitimate reason to be there.  I may be collecting
quest items, or tradeskill components, or faction bumps,
or simply cash (high-level people need cash, too).  Or I might
just be goofing around for a bit of fun in a zone that used
to kick my ass, now that the tables have turned.
