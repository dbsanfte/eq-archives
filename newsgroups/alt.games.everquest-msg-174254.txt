I've been playing the game for about a year and I didnt' even get Luclin
until about 6 months ago.  Yes it makes travel easier, but you don't NEED
it.  I was able to travel to many zones and do a lot of things without the
expansion.  Now days the most important thing offered by the Luclin
expansion is the bazaar.  When I started playing the main trading center was
Freeport.  Now that the bazaar has opened, no one goes there so if you need
to buy or sell something you are really handicapped by not having Luclin,
but again, you don't NEED it.  You can still buy/sell in other zones, the
Bazaar is just a convenience.

They probably will do that.  After a new expansion has been out for a while
they usually offer a combo-set that includes everything.

There have been a LOT of changes to make play easier for newbies in just the
year I have been playing.  When I started playing even a 1st level character
had to make a corpse run.  A lot of us didn't bother because we didn't have
much of value on our bodies, but as soon as I acquired a little armor and
decent weapon I was going on corpse runs. Top that with the fact that under
6th level your corpse decayed in about one day vs. seven days and being a
noob was really tough.

There was also experience loss for death at much lower levels. (can't
remember what level it started though)

There was no built in compass. (I was lost about 75% of the time for the
first three months I played)

As a caster when you sat down to regain mana you had to look at the inside
of your spell book.  You couldn't see what was going on around you.

There was no KEI.

It' s now easier for newbies to make money and low level gear is cheaper and
easier to get than ever before.  Items I paid 400pp for a year ago now sell
for about 150pp.  Most noobs by 15th level have better gear than I had at
40.

POK exists.  Yes, you have to buy it, but at least it's there.  Any first
level player can travel safely all over Norrath.  Luclin made travel easier,
but there were only two spires in newbie zones, G Fay and Toxx, so only a
few starting races could take advantage of them.

Right before I started the Soulbinders were added.  Before that you had to
bum a bind off of a caster anytime you needed a bind in a new city.

There were no newbie armor quests.

Like I said once the expansion has been out a while they will probably
include it in a set.  It has only been out since Oct.  There is plenty to do
in the expansions that you have.  Take a little more time out to see if you
really enjoy the game, and if you do then invest in the other expansions.
For me the cost is negligible (even when I have to buy three copies of
everything-one for each family member that plays) because when I divide the
cost by the number of hours I play it's very cheap.

If you are just checking EQ out and don't plan on really getting into the
game I wouldn't bother making the investment. But, after you have played a
couple months, if you really like it, then buy POP, you won't regret it.
