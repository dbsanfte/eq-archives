It's nothing to do with your modem.

It's *possible* its EQ itself. The latest patch was a disaster of
ginormous proportions.

If you did scandisk and defragged and its still happening then this
was going to be the next suggestion.

You can try reinstalling EQ too.

If that doesn't work and its not actually a problem with EQ itself
you've probably fried something, either memory, harddrive, or
motherboard.
