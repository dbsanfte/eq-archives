It is.   There is a bonus attached to each mob, which is based on your
individual level compared to the mob's level.  If the mob is within 5 levels
of you, you gain more experience for killing it, and additional experience
for every level over that it is.   If the mobs you're fighting are around
level 57, staying 62 vs 63 means a large exp bonus.   If they're higher than
57, it means a moderate bonus.   If lower, no change at all, and your
original idea is then correct.

The split is not a significant factor.   A 62 in a group with everyone else
level 65 would get 16.02067%  of the experience for the kill.   A 65 would
get 16.666667% of the experience.

The level based difficulty bonus is greater than 6 tenths of a percent.
Much greater, with a 3 level difference.

Of course, this analysis ignores any extra kills over a given time period
that your increased level could give your group, and the value of increased
safety from negative experience (party wipeouts and death).

Overall, IMO, it makes a lot more sense to get 65.   But with the way the
numbers work out, and a touch of greed...  a significant amount of players
will stay lower leveled to allow thier group to carry them to get what they
believe is a faster AA gain.
