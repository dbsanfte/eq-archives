But they are claiming 250,000 new subscribers per year.  The total has been
in the low 400's for a long time, and that would seem to mean that they must
be losing about 250,000 per year.

That's both good and bad.  It's good in the sense that it means there should
indeed be plenty of newbies available, so someone starting out might
actually be able to play with fellow newbies, instead of just twinks.

On the other hand, it's bad in that it indicates that people coming to the
game are, in a large number of cases, not finding it worth sticking with.
This could explain the "crank out the expansions" strategy--with that much
turnover, they might be making more on expansion sales than on subscription
fees!

Other interesting things in their anniversary information:

They say the youngest player is 9.  Wasn't there someone here a few days ago
who has a 4 year old playing?

They say the game world is over 350 square miles.  I'm not sure I believe
this.  Let's take Antonica.  Here are the relative areas of various Antonica
zones outdoor zones:

    48.1    South Karana
    22.5    North Karana
    15.0    East Karana
    51.6    West Karana
     7.2    Qeynos Hills
    17.1    Everfrost
    10.0    Lake Rathetear
    16.9    Rathe Mountains
    11.3    The Feerott
     7.3    Innothule Swamp
     7.2    Southern Desert of Ro
     7.3    Oasis of Marr
     8.3    Northern Desert of Ro
     9.4    East Commonlands
     7.8    Nektulos Forest
     7.5    West Commonlands
    10.9    Kithicor Forest
     4.7    Lavastorm Mountains
     5.6    Misty Thicket

Those add up to 275.7 in the units I was using.

Let's figure out the size of South Karana in square miles in order to relate
those numbers to square miles.  Running across SK in the long direction with
jboots takes about 260 seconds.  It's about 150 seconds in the short
direction.  Let's be generous, and assume an EQ character's normal running
speed is 25 miles/hour (around top human sprinting speed), and so that puts
jboots at 34 miles/hour).  260 seconds at 34 miles/hour is 2.46 miles.  150
seconds at 34 miles/hour is 1.42 miles.  That gives SK an area of 3.49
square miles.

That gives the outdoor Antonica zones a combined area of 20.0 square miles.

Starting from that, anyone want to try to estimate the rest of the game?  
I don't think outdoor Antonica is so small as to only be 6% of the total!
