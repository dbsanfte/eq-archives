   /assist just grok'd on me a while back.  I never
used it before, after almost a year of play, then I
got in a group where the leader specified at the start
who the main /assist person was.  I used it, and in
a very short order of time learned to love it.  I
really like that if you /assist a mob, it targets the
party member the mob is beating on.  Beautiful.
   Um...sorry... got off track.  What mod would I add?
Well... I've not got the Vision, so any thing I 
would do would probably fuck things up.  I think I
would vote for unlimited space on both my friends and
ignore list.  Oh..and an enemies list...  for those
you don't want to necessarily ignore, but want to 
have on your "bad karma" list.
