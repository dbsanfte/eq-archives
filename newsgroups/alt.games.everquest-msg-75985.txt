I would not think PC Zone has their own servers. All servers are run by
Verant/Sony/the guy with the big hat. Anyways... It is a lot cheaper if you
wait till Electronics Boutique has some copies of EQ in store, though it
might take a bit longer. Without it, you're not missing too much, Kunark and
Velious. You can level and explore perfectly well with only the Original
EQ... Just my 2 coppers.
