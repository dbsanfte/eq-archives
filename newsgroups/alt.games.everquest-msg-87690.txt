>>> so since Verant is screwin me outta my money <<<

OK, let's analyze this:

EQ costs $10 a month to play. I'm going to assume a 30 day month, to make
math a little easier.

That means you pay approx $.33 a day to play EQ. From what my guildees said
last night, the servers were down for approx 4 hours.

That means you were screwed out of approx $.055.
In case you missed the decimal point, that's five and a half cents you were
screwed out of.

And if your life is so pathetic that it hurts you to be screwed out of five
and a half cents, then you need to find another hobby.

BTW, the scheduled patch this morning is going to cost you approx $.083. How
will you ever pay your rent.
