Trouble is, there really *isn't* that much else along that line.

I did think of this, after our exchange.  I know you hunt in SF a lot
and I thought, I'll bet Biz is talking about some
bored-out-of-his-mind cleric camping Rage, who would undoubtedly look
upon *any* interaction with another human being as a plus,
compensation or no.  Poor bloody bastard.

But may I suggest to you that SF isn't the norm?

Fact is, if I'm not in a town, I'm in a group or running to meet one.
If I want to do tradeskills, I'm in a town.  If I'm resupplying, I'm
in a town.  Catch me for free rezzes then.  If I'm *not* in a town,
I'm grouped, fighting, probably low on mana and while I will probably
rez you if you ask nicely, you are impacting my group and, yes, some
form of compensation would be nice.
