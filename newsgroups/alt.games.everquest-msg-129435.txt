I soloed my first HG at level 29 with my magician.  It wasn't easy, and it
took me multiple unsuccessful tries before I got it working.  I did it just
to prove that it could be done.  That was before Kunark existed, though that
probably doesn't matter all that much to casters.

I'd guess you just won't have the mana to finish one off until you're 30+ as
a druid.
