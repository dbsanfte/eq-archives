EIGHTY-TWO BUCKS??  I sure hope that was for 2+ years...I just paid $35 for
mine (one year) and it comes with unlimited web space (like I need more than
1MB) with one caveat...a banner.  Not an annoying one, but a banner
nonetheless.  In a few months we'll move it to a friend's server to dump the
banner.   www.names4ever.com   It's a .com.
