What Video Card are you running?  I had a Geforce 1 and saw the new textures
and was a little bit let down.  But the jerkiness of the video inspired me
to go and get a Geforce 3.  Now, things look a whole bunch better.  Textures
look much smoother.  Also, do you have the bitperpixel set to 32 or to 16 in
your eqclient file?  Going from 16 bits to 32 bits made a big improvement in
the graphics aswell.
