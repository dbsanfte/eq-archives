Charm breaks on disconnect.  Try fighting a swarm of mobs as a bard sometimes,
eight bad guys versus your champion pet, only to disconnect... you come back to
a grease stain every time, since that means all 9 went after you when charm
dropped, and the AI doesn't know to fire up selos and run to zone!

Or try using bard invis sometime.  Disconnect, you log back in and even if your
invis is still up, its only going to last a few seconds, and you can't start it
again without breaking the one you have.  Zone, the same thing happens, if you
zone in to a hostile area you have to hope you can move to out of sight before
it wears off... but somehow the clock's been running during the zone process, so
instead of 18 seconds you probably only have two or three left.

Necromancers have pets, as do enchanters and shaman... I won't count druids,
who's pet is very wimpy by the time they get it; if they had a pet up and lost
it it didn't cost them much.
