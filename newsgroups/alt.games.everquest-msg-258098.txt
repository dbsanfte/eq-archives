You would think so.   But it has not been my experience.   In any sizable
raid force, there are always at least a few who are paying more attention to
the football game on the TV next to them than to what they're doing.    Pet
classes seem to be particularly prone to this, as a lot of fights they can
get away with doing little more than hitting thier "/pet attack" key at the
beginning.

*shrug*   I'm suprised you don't know already why it matters.    I learned
pretty quickly after watching a few wipes.

*shrug*   Shit happens.  Enough room when you begin pulling isn't always
enough room when the actual mobs are chasing you.

You'd have to be a pretty strangely balanced guild to have pets be a sizable
fraction of your DPS.   Sure, it can happen...  my first guild seemed to be
40% rangers, 40% druids, and 20% everything else...  but not too likely.

And a very strange guild in other ways, for the majority of your pet users
not to have this AA already.

Although I suppose if its not required for you guys, I guess it's an obvious
place to slack off in favor of more "fun" AA's.
