	I believe this is a straw man argument.  You're postulating an
exploit that is at the same time so powerful and unbalancing that it
requires an immediate emergency fix yet so subtle that an innocent
player could naively execute it in the course of normal play and not even
notice.

	Can you give me an example of such a thing?  And do you believe
that such instances occur often enough to explain the frequency of
emergency downtime we see?
