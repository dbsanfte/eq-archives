For tradeskills, which include Fishing, and some other skills, could very 
well include sense heading and swimming, the highest stat of either INT or 
WIS is used to determine the chance of a skillup.  For most melee skills, 
DEX is used to determine the chance of a skillup.  So, yes, INT can have an 
effect on skillups in certain skills.
