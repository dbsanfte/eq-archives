    It's very out of the way for folks of the level range to go there. At
level ten I'm trying to get cash for spells and armour better than cloth,
not trying to get a port to a distant city where I'll also need a
precautionary bind before rushing past the guards, then a real bind outside
the dungeon. It's too bad, too - having a newbie dungeon be right off the
city zone is REALLY convenient, especially a city zone with essentially one
faction that's raised in the dungeon in question. ( FYI, Duriek Bloodpool
and a human NPC at the "ruins" both /con dubious to my Ally-in-Paineel
necro.)

    I think the Warrens loot code is aimed mostly at lower-level zones than
this, and ones which have "named" spawns that can load quality loot. Droga
would have been a solid Warrens candidate, because of the Idol, but because
of the idiocy of the zone point design NOBODY of correct level goes there.
Because nobody at mid to low levels really wants to go through a long,
complicated corpse recovery.

    They're changing nothing, to use Verantspeak - these are NEW zones,
which will ALWAYS have the Warrens code. Haven't you learned how they
respond yet? ;-)

    Hopefully there will be a strong dungeon where the Loot code can be
proven or disproven. IF Verant added a new zone off Oasis, say, (there is a
zone line-area on the west wall) THEN we could see if a well-designed zone
that is easy to access would generate interest. It's sad, really, that so
few areas have good enough XP and strong enough loot to draw people to them.
