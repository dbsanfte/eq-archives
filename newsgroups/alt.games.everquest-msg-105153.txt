You need to work harder. I'm sure my 24 wizzy beats that in percentage
and raw mana. Let's see, he's an Erudite, level 24, with base INT of
135. So what's his naked mana pool? (I forget the damn formula just
now.)

Then, with his gear on he's got an INT of 203 and another 135 in +Mana
items.  I need to run and find the formula to do this conversion. But
yeah, he's a little twinked. Throw in the jboots he has, the Staff of
Temperate Flux he'll have tonight, and you might even say he's a *good*
bit twinked. He he he he.
