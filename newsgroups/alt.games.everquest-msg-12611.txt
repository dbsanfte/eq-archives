Ok, I'll bite. Why is stealing mana from others something that only
enchanters, and possibly SK/necros can do? What is the rationale for
this statement? I don't see any storyline reason why wizards, being a
class that lives or dies by their mana, should not have some ability
to tap magical potential that exists in others around them. Why is
this an enchanter schtick? Enchanters have the sole domain of
illusions, and charms, and mind control type spells, they should also
have sole domain of mana stealing spells? Why?

To be honest, I'm not real concerned about adhering to any "class
vision" bullshit. At this point, I'm talking about actual gameplay
balance and playability issues. If you want to talk about "class
vision" why do healer classes like clerics get any form of direct
damage nuke at all? I'm not trying to slam on clerics or any class,
but the fact is that clerics get DD that rivals that of wizards.
Wizards never get ANY healing spells at all, much less healing than
comes close to what clerics can do. Clerics can actually come close to
wizards in the damage they can do with direct magical attack. Doesn't
it seem a bit odd that clerics get nukes that do as much damage as
wizard nukes? I heard one cleric justify this by saying, "yeah, but we
get that nuke 6 levels after the equivalent wizard nuke" Fine, give my
wiz complete heal 6 levels after clerics get it and we are even.

Or what's the "vision" behind druids? A nature worshipping class that
gets access to practically every spell line. Funny that a tree lover
has so many direct fire spells at their disposal. That really seems to
fit the class image, NOT. Same with Necro's, how did being a dealer in
undead, translate into being able to give mana to others? Verant was
even able to justify a mez effect for necros and called it screaming
terror. Did necro's need this skill to be wanted in groups? Was it
imperative that this ability belong to necros because it defined their
class? I don't mind if necros get a mez called screaming terror, but
why is it unnaceptable to give wizards a freeze spell that has the
same effect? For that matter, clerics could have the same thing, and
call it epiphany or something (mob finds god and stands around looking
stupid for awhile). Any class at all could have this ability, and have
it be "justified" for class reasons, but not be balanced for gameplay
reasons. Warriors could get a skill that let them stun their opponent
with their blinding weapon skill. Druids could imbue a target with the
desire to be a vegetable. Mages could place a cryptic symbol before
the targets eyes to confuse them. You see what I mean? Any class
differences can easily be skirted just like what was done with
screaming terror. So it's past time that people sat this nonsense
argument aside, and focus on balancing gameplay.

People try to pigeonhole wizards as dealers in damage, and use that as
an excuse to deny them any buffs from spell lines that are not
directly related to causing damage. Well, that would be fine, if you
just remove all nukes from healers, remove all crowd control from pet
classes, remove all mana buffing effects from everyone except
chanters. In other words, act consistently across all classes. Not
consistently fuck wizards in the ass.
