They've received a lot of love from Sony/VI in the past 18 months or so.
They're the tank of choice in PoP xp groups because they can grab agro
instantly, allowing everyone else to unload their damage immediately without
danger of getting attention from mobs.  With warriors they usually have to
wait to let the warrior build agro.  It's all about maximizing xp per hour,
and it's better with a pally/sk than a warrior.
