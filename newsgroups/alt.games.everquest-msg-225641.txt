Doesn't bother me at all. There's no rule against it. People have every 
right to sell their stuff for whatever price they want. 

That said, price fixing doesn't work. I don't care how many people might 
get together and settle on a price. There will always be someone else to 
come along and undercut them all. It will happen enough that the "fixers" 
resolve will crumble and they will be at each others' throats once again.
