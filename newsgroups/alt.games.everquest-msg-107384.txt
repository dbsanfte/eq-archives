Help me out here, th, since maybe my reading skills aren't up to snuff.
Where exactly there does it specify (and by that I mean the specifics)
of what information and resources the guides, seniors, and GMs each have
access to. (The example from this thread would be to state who can and
can not see /reports)

I see *one* mention of reports on that page. Same one that's always been
there.
"How can I handle verbal harassment by another player?
The best course of action is to immediately use the /report "playername"
command. It is a player's most powerful tool in these instances. If the
harassment continues in another form, (the person follows you throughout
the game attempting to injure or annoy you), /petition your incident
immediately."

That's it. That's all they say. This could leave it open to pretty wide
interpretation that all guides, etc. would then have access that
information to decide issues that are petitioned. But they don't. So why
not just have a simple page of "Here's what Guides, Seniors, and GM's
can see and do if you are having issues in the game."?  Could clear up a
lot of confusion and probably improve the rep that the guides get.
