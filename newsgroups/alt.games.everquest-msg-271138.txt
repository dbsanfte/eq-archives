Similar numbers on Tunare.  My bazaar mule has zero LDoNs, he's
gone from ca. 12200 to 9330.  Up until the day of EQ2's release
there was a slow increase in the number of characters with one
or more LDoN win, since then there has been a steady decrease.
Similarly, there was a slow decrease in upper-50s lower-60s
LFG, starting after OoW came out in September, since EQ2/WoW
numbers dropped much more noticeably and now there are rarely
more than 4-6 in that range except during prime-time.
