Eep again, you have to supersede with the same newsreader that posted
the original message. Otherwise it'd be way easy to forge supersedes,
and edit others' posts into saying something inflammatory or libelous.
And believe me, lots of people on Usenet would do that a lot...

But look on the bright side, how often do you really *need* to edit a
posted message?
