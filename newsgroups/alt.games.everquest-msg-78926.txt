 Well faction reasons for one. Most true 'Newbie' guards have been
buffed and normally are not killed. What particular guards was someone
killing? Guards out in Commons are about the only wimpy ones I can
recall. And the Neriak ones on the way to Lavastorm. 

 Anyway, if that was me I would have simply done a /report and put you
on ignore. Seems you were the annoying one here and not the person
killing guards.
