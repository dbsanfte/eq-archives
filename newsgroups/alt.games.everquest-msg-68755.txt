Being logged on and sitting in Rivervale doesn't exactly qualify as
"playing" as far as I'm concerned and I suspect for the vast majority
of EQ players.

Until the recent patch, you couldn't stay connected to the server for
more than 90 mins in some of the "fun" Luclin zones because the memory
leaks were so severe.  People were LDing consistently due to memory
leaks.

Lag was so severe due to those "pauses" in many Luclin zones, it was
impossible to fight.  

These were bugs, they were bugs VI introduced and fixed just last
night.  The sad part was these were bugs that were already known.  I
know I sent in /bug reports when they sent out the notice to test the
new DX8 library for the graphics engine.

I saw the unbounded memory leak with that engine and also the
momentary pauses.

Check again.
Are those /who all for the guilds in zones like ssatemple or akheva or
umbral or templeofveeshan?  Because those zones were damn near
impossible to play--I mean you would turn and have a 10 second "pause"
before anything happened.

Unfortunately, this is false assumption.
SoL is an expansion. It's not a standalone product.  

Trying to hit the Christmas ship date is probably the reason why we're
seeing so many bugs.  And the irony is, I don't think the number of
"new" EQ players that purchased SoL is even remotely close to the
number of existing EQ players that purchased SoL.

That would imply that even if you released SoL after the New Years,
folks would have still bought the game.  Basically, in my opinion,
they rushed a product to hit a ship date that really wasn't meaningful
for the product.
