Well put!

I'd also like to say that if you *want* to be twinked, it really isn't
that hard.  Get to know other players.  Make friends.  That lvl 1 druid
that's swatting at Wasps with a rusty scimitar might have a main that's a lvl 52
Cleric that has lots of platinum and has so far decided not to twink his lowbie.
If you make friends, he might well offer to get you a leg up... some
nice leather armor, for example, or some nice weapon.

The main reason, though, to make friends on the server is to have fun.  If
that gets you twinked, and you want that, all the better!

Personally, I haven't been twinked much, but my wife who has a tendency
to be a bit more verbal with other players has gotten some real nice equipment,
esp. for her level: a crystal grinder piercing weapon, chain mail, various
leather armor, a velium war hammer, and a hunting knife with nice stats (I don't
recall the name off-hand).  And I know what you're thinking... it's because her
cartoon is female... well, one of my characters is a female too and hers gets
twinked more than mine does.  It's mostly the friend-making working, not the
sexy pixels.  I should mention that this was all on server where the
generalization is that the players there are selfish - Tallon Zek (PvP teams)

Have fun
