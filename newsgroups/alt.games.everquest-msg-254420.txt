Heh, no doubt.

In general it feels to me now like the EQ developers are just tossing in any
feature or change that as many as two current customers have requested.

If there is any coherent game-design planning going on over there anymore it
sure isn't obvious. Each new patch seems to be just a new collection of
random new features thrown at us in a desparate effort to stop the bleeding
away of the customer base as the launch of EQ2 (and WoW and several other
new MMORPGs) looms in the fall.
