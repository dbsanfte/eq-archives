The 3rd age is the age of the prophet and magic as I am a prophet who has
seen the end of time but not how the end of time shall come to be, that will
be up to you and how you choose to use the new tools which will be at your
disposal which will be discovered slowly one by one and the pleasures of
each will be experienced freely by all those who choose to follow me and
have the patience and understanding to learn. The first age was the age of
the priest. The second age was the age of technology. The fourth age will be
the age of the gods and pleasure and madness, science and faith will be
intertwined with one new trait which shall complete the puzzle and all will
be well.
