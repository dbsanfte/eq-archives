Undead froglok tongue is used in a PoK quest.  Some quest items don't
list the quest because (according to Sony) some quests have not been
figuresd out yet. 

Allakhazam has a very thorough database, but I have seen gaps where a
quest lists an item but the item did not point to the quest. An e-mail
got that fixed; others may find other similar gaps.
