We, TA, could, we, the alliance could not, unless there is a change in what
the current rotation guilds regard as acceptable.  Certainly, we could hit
the pickup slot for VS regardless, but, that is not the issue.  The issue is
that we are an alliance of guilds that have been together for some time, we
raid together regularly, and plan to continue doing so.  We are interested
in taking down some mobs in the game, and other guilds have come up with an
agreed upon rotation that excludes us.  That is a patently unfair situation,
but unless we are willing to assume the risk of angering many large guilds
on EMarr, we don't have much choice.
