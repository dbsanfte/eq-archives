True.  Liberals fawn/fawned all over people like Joe Stalin, Castro
and Pol Pot.  They have this bizarre attraction to mass murderers and
tyrants.

Jimmy Carter was supposedly the "smartest" American President (we
heard the same drivel about Clinton too).  Carter will fly to the ends
of the earth to humor and kiss up to Castro, Chvez in Venezuela and
Kim Il Sung Gook II in North Korea.  Maybe Carter can go build houses
for these despots.

Carter is a super intelligent liberal half-wit.
