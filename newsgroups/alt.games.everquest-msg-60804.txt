I'm an 8th level Necro (about two bubbles short of 9th level), and my group
tactic is to basically stand back and cast Poison Bolt at the current target
while my skeleton helps the other tanks take it out. If the Poison Bolt is
resisted, I don't try again, because it probably won't work, anyway. If more
than one creature is pulled by accident, then I use Fear on the others. If the
current problem is a target, then it gets a dose of Clinging Darkness or a
Lifespike. Other than that, I stand back meditating until the next target is
ready.
