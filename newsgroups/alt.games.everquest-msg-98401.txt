The hidden (or perhaps simply "conveniently ignored") difference is this:

(the following numbers are totally made up)

Pre:  Blackburrow (dungeon), level 5-15:  1200 kills
Post: 600 kills

Same total experience points rewarded...half experience actually earned.

They need to start everyone at level 11 and require 10 kills per level until
46...that'll give lots of people instant orgasms.
