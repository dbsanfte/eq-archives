Your reaching.

"game knowledge and experience combined with good grouping skills" avoid
ever being in this "situation" you are talking about, C3 or not.   If we
have these 4 mobs, then we are using some sort of crowd control.      If you
keep pulling when in danger of running outa mana, that can happen on thr
5th, 6th, 7th mob....  C3 or not.    The risk just happens later with C3.

Nope, C3 doesnt make the game easier, just lets ya kill more stuff.
