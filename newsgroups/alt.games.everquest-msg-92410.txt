Maybe it does matter.  Maybe NOT moving your corpse allows the GM/guide to 
get an exact reading on what location you were at when the bug struck.  
Maybe they're trying to pinpoint why this happens, and having the exact 
loc will allow them to check their zoning code, or the RNG, or some other 
minor process.  
I'm sure the collect brains on this newsgroup could come up with 100 
reasons why the GMs would want you to NOT move your corpse.  I just assume 
that if they ask me not to next time, it's for a good reason.
