The unattractive alternative to DD kiting and Root Rotting, a twisted
sort of DOT kite, is not only a bit zany, but actually inefficient, because
a mob that is moving towards you takes only 2/3rd the normal damage
from a DOT.  If you are root rotting, when root breaks your first priority
is to re-apply root if the mob isn't injured enough to run.

DOTs are for mobs that are Rooted, stationary in melee, or running away
in Fear or from low HP totals.  One popular shaman option is to root,
DOT up, then wade in swinging when root breaks, confident that thier
DOT plus pet plus hasted melee output will win out against thier target's
slowed damage output.

As a cleric, until recent additions of some undead only dots, with no snare
(except for DE clerics, like the shaman item you mention) I had to do
a sloppy root/dd kite, where I lay on a fast root, back to max range, nuke
till root breaks (often on first cast) move back while spells cycle, and reroot
to repeat.
