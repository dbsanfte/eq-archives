I've been providing you information.  You continually twist it.  I'm just
trying to clarify if this in unintentional and I should change my vocabulary
and examples, or if you're just trying to be evasive.

No I have done no bragging.  You asked about my children's ages and
abilities and I provided the information.  IMO children asking questions
about the world around them and wanting answers to those questions doesn't
indicate a prodigy, it indicates that the child is alive.

OHH, I'm so scared. He called me a braggart. Let me run and hide now.  I'm
still waiting for you to begin debating issues.  So far you've called me
names, stated I was lying, stated I didn't know about what I spoke of,
twisted my words, and refused to acknowledge what I've actually said. When
you're ready to engage in disucssion I'll be happy to begin one. (My
apologies for the circular and run-on sentences -- it's late, I'm tired, and
I dont' care to try to think).
