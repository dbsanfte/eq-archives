OK, then let me rephrase myself ...

Edit
"I just wish it would save lists ... I get tired of adding the same 25 songs
every time I start EQ"

to read
"I just wish I knew how to save lists ... I get tired of adding the same 25
songs every time I start EQ"

But if you can loads an entire directory by typing *.mp3, looks like all I
need to do is copy all the songs I want to hear into a new folder, then fire
up that folder when I need it.
