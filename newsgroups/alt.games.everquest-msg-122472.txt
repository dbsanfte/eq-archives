There was some debate on wether bow+arrow range was capped at 250... dunno
if it was ever proven, tho.

Reason for the doubt was that some Rangers with Darkwood Bows (range 150)
and 150 range, Fletched arrows (total range = 300)couldn't hit targets that
a Mage casting Flame Bolt (range 300) could.

Anyone know anything more?
