Heya

A friend of mine has been taking an intrest in my EQ activitys of late, and
has expressed an intrest in playing, So I have decided to help ease him into
the game by creating a level one toon to work along side him, leveling up
and questing.

But I was wonder what combination of 2 toons would work best ?
Both of us would start at level one, and other than weapons we would be
untwinked, at first I thought of spending 1k on each char to get them some
nice starting gear enabling them to shoot through the low levels but I
remember how satisfying I found it to kit my own toon out in a full set of
either self quested or self made armour and I didnt want to take this
expirence from him (But most the low level weapons are rubbish dmg/dly
ratios so I will spend about 500pp each on a weapon)

But anyway so what class/race combination would make a good duo ?
Both accounts have all expansions (Well except LoY) so travels not a
problem, nor is selling/buying ...

I was thinking SK and Druid ? (Snare, Dmg shield, Fear, masses of DoTs,
pets, Charm, evac, High ac + High hp tank)

Monk + Shammy (DoTs, High dps, Heals, pet, root, Awesome melee buffs)

Necro + Mage (Pet power, High mana regen, mana transfer, Powerful nukes,
free bandages/weapons/focus items)

Bard + Cleric ( Rezzes, HP + AC buffs, Mana regen, haste, DoTs, Selos, Fear,
Charm)

I doubt they will get beyond the mid 30's so I'm not too worried about the
High end game, we are just looking for a fun and noob-friendly combination
really, any suggestions would be great =)

Thanks for your time
