This is inaccurate.  I have resed at least a hundred people who were
well over the three hour limit.  Many of these, I was present at
time of death and actually wrote it down, knowing a long CR was
coming.  In those cases I can be certain that 3 and a half hours or more
passed between death and res, but an hour of that time was in chat.
Further, I have on a couple occaisions found res impossible due
to time out at 3 and a two minutes while someone who died a minute later
was still resable at 3 hours 45 minutes... as the first person insisted on
staying to port people and coffins around, while the other guy logged
out and spent the majority of the time in chat.

In addition to those cases I could directly verify, I've done any number
of res where the person reported logging out the night before, longest
case I know of was 18 hours and still resable, but he logged immediately
on dying and it didn't take him ten minutes to find me and arrange for
me to res him.  In at least one case like that, a RL friend was the dead
one, and I woke up in the morning to find an email asking me to call him
and then log on and res, that gave me a time of email (death must have
occured before that, unless this was an elaborate scheme to convince
me the 3 hour/24 hour clock is accurate when it is not) putting death
at -least- 8 hours before the res.

3 hours logged on to any server, any character, on your account.  24
hours in chat and or logged off your account completely.  Proportional.
Really.  I am not (as Dave Barry always puts it) making this up.
