Programmers are NOT customer service.  In fact, I think with very, very 
few exceptions programmers are the LAST people you want doing CS.  The 
general concensus on this newsgroup is that Verant losing several very 
senior people is what initiated many of the popular customer service 
changes made recently.
If you actually think that the loss of a coder has ANYTHING to do with 
how the CS side of the house works, you really, really need to move out 
of mommy and daddy's house, get a job, and see the real world.  My 
biggest headache running ISP backbones were customers who didn't 
understand why I wouldn't do <foo> for them.  At least working in a 
corporate security department I can just say 'it's insecure' and people 
look for another solution.  I'm not the best person to do CS.  
DAoC had the most sucessful roll-out ever.  They did many things right.  
My guild lost three people to DAoC, two of them are back.  My original 
guild lost about 10 people to DAoC (a much more casual playerbase), all 
but two of them were back within a month.  
If you go to the DAoC site, they mention that they sold 200,000 copies, 
since release.  Even if 100% of those who bought the game are still 
playing it, that's still 1/2 the size of the EQ playerbase.  Based on the 
responses I've seen and people I know who play it, I would be suprised if 
they have more than 100,000 active accounts.  It's not even in the same 
league as Everquest at this point.
