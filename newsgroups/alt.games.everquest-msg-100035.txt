teehee


And once you get REALLY high you'll have monks pulling mjust so they CAN
pull massive trains. Got bored in chardok. Had a group of 2 hierophants,
2 phatasmists and a Sorceror. And me.

AoE just makes me feel so insignificant ;)

Or the evaccer... we've started playing with a /disc weaponshield rotation
as well as a CH rotation for when things go wrong. Pretty much guarentees
a cleric camp out or successful evacs.

And actually, this is a lot of fun. When you know theres a rez coming 
playing that last-ditch hero to get the cleric out is exhilerating. 30
or 40 massive critters on you, training them away to die and screaming
at the clerics to camp out before you die and they all come pouring back.

Its an interesting curve. You get slowly better at a particular style
of play through the lower levels until suddenly everyone understands what
they're about (usually when you finally find a good guild or set of regular
playing partners) and suddenly you actually have the safety margin to start
pulling really goofy shit again, and you go back to the chaos of the
original "no idea what we're doing" groups, except you enjoy it ;)

Thank the gods you're not an enchanter. Tash, Cripple, Slow, *splat*

They die a lot.
