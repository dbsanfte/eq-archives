What good would a wizard do?

Bring you naked back to where you died, where the see invis mobs will
just kill you again
while you try to get the first body?  A druid could do that just as
well.

What you need is a necromancer and a coffin... though if you don't have
access to
170pp or so just for the coffin, that's not going to help much either.
Oh, and if you
can arrange that, -then- you need the wizard or druid, because you must
be
in the zone for that to work.
