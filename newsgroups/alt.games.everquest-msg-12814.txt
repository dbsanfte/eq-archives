Right click on another play at close range and you can view their equipment
(but not their 8 inventory slots.)

They do it because they are curious.

It does no harm.

If it bothers you, there is a command to turn off the "so-and-so is inspecting

Some people get offended by unsolicited inspections. I can't see why, but they
do, so try to be polite about it.
