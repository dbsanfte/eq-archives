I play EQ using the game card. $60.00 Can for 3 months. This works out to
$20.00 per month, I know it is a lot cheaper using a credit card but pfft...
what is an extra 6 dollars or so. This compared to my last hobby has saved
me a lot of cash. Before I started played EQ, I played alot of pool.... and
I mean a lot.

Saturday - $5.00
Sunday - $10.00
Monday - $6.00
Tuesday - $7.00
Wednesday - $10.00
Friday - Anywhere from $20-$40.

This was just every week, every month. This does not include the amount of
smokes I went through (and at $5-$8 a pack it adds up) over all I usually
spent about $150.00 a month doing this. Personally if ya can't afford to
shell out the $12-$20 per month, then don't play.
