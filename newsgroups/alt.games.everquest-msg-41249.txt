I"ve been using the firepots as a principle means of transport for
several characters now, a hundred levels or more of swimming
TD, and I"ve never seen a thing in the water.

Faydedar has been nerfed, he no longer randomly spawns, you
will never spot him out by the firepots though his ledgend does
still stop non-porters from using the best public transit system in
Norrath.  He appears only at the hidden inn, and only when
purposefully spawned.

Spirocs are fun, and they are an easy hop from Oasis,
or for non binders Freeport, with a barge available to
take you back or a boat to take you on to Kunark
if you prefer when you are done.

Raptors, on the other hand, are a good long swim,
meaning a long CR, though a safe one.  You will
be near the Firepots when done, though, so pretty
much all of pre-velious Norrath is yours for the
taking when you decide to leave.  They are
Mean, though, and there's limited fear kite room unless
you pull em out to sea, perhaps.

Seafury Cyclops are good hunting, good exp, passable
cash loot... keep an eye on the AC island, though,
and take that camp when it opens up.  In between
6 minute spawns of the AC placeholders you can
pull Seafuries from the next island over just as easily
as from their own island, and you will eventually get
JBoots out of the deal, without the pain of camping
just the AC!
