I've seen a dozen rumors as to how this was done, but the idea behind
all of them was that someone found a way to turn platinum into More
platinum, whether by duplicating it (take 1000pp and turn it into 2000,
and so on) or by multiplying it tenfold.  In some cases it was described
as a method to make the system leave your original cash by quitting the
game just after putting it somewhere else, so you got both copies of the
amount, in others, a banker giving incorrect change on conversion
operations, in others as a trade skill combine that sold for far more
than the cost of the components (to a vendor)

Only the first sort would be correctly termed Dupe (for duplication),
but the term is generically used for all methods of exploiting loopholes
in the game to generate large amounts of wealth rapidly.

Yet another rumor had it that some mob was dropping 10kpp each time he
was killed, or some other amount.  This wouldn't be duping at all, but
it would still dump large amounts of cash into the game.

Splendid
