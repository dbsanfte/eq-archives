I know the video card discussion has been here before, but since the
company I ordered from has not worked out, I have to reorder from else
where and am again looking at my options.   First, the Nvidia GeForce
was highly recommended in the Ti series. Having a 1gig pentium
processor, I orginally ordered a PNY GeForce3 Ti200. The company has
had them on back order for a month, so I canceled the order and am
looking at other sources.  I now see that I can get the PNY GeForce4
Ti4200 for almost the same money. If cost is not an issue, would I not
be better off with the Ti4200 or is the Ti200 a better card ?
AND, in the 200 dollar range, is the GeForce still the best choice ?
Sorry for all the questions, but want to get this right the first
time, don't think the wife will let there be a next time :-)    .
