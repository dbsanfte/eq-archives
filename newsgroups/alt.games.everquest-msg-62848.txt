You don't know how passenger pigeons became extinct, do you?

Summary: they existed in billions and billions in North America, but
weren't very smart. They were incredibly easy kills (especially young
birds) and tasted good, and excessive hunting reduced them from one of
the most populous species on the planet to a couple zoo specimens in
less than a century. The last female died in a zoo in 1914.

Let me know if you still don't understand why he compared the
'abundance of free map sites' to the former abundance of passenger
pigeons.
