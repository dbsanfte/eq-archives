According to the smithing trade supplies page at www.eqtraders.com, there are no sharpening stones in FV.   However
that may have changed since Verant said they rounded out the trade supplies in some of the zones.

If you fail to find any in FV, head over to the Butcherblock Mtns. on the boat, and go into Kaladim.  There's a guy inside
the mine named Bloam Norkhitter who sells them (along with other smithing supplies).
