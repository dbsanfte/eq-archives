Guess I'm unsure as to how this constitutes an exploit. So, by avoiding
aggro we're exploiting? If Martar Icebear's walking along and I scoot out of
his way, am I exploiting? He's not aggro on anyone at that moment...

I sincerely hope we're not amid 300,000+ people like this. The game would
get real lame real fast. Do they need to deal with exploiters? Yes. Should
there be some kind of understanding as to what comprises an exploit?
Definitely. Did they overreact in Conquest's case? Yes. We'll see how many
people actually leave... there are games on the horizon; people may figure
it's as good a time as any.

I, for one, am selling out. I'll be staying on. But, in terms of my
principles, I'd be gone. Man... I'm lame.
