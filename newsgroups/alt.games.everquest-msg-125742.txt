When you talk to that guy in Solusek Ro Temple, he mentions a wand that adds
FOCUS and such. But after completing the quest, this wand only adds +3INT,
and no focus skill at all.
Is this item bugged, or is he reffering to FOCUS due to it adds +3INT?
Also, he seems to give back the Bloodback Rod and says he doesnt need it.
The wand also has 2 charges of "Strip Enchantment". Is there anyway to
charge the wand up again?
