I'm currently playing a Barbarian Rogue, who as a result can't be very 
roguely in the night due to her lack o'night sight ;)  She has her GLS to 
keep her from walking into walls, and her trusy Shaman (hi Sorem!) 
companion keeps her in Serpent Sight as much as possible, but she's 
wondering what items she could buy/get that would help her. 

I've heard about the Glowing Stone Band which gives permanent Serpent 
Sight, but before she wanders over to EC to see what she can find, I'd like 
to have some idea of what I should be looking for.  Any ideas what items 
are out there? I tried searching on Allakhazam's but I can't search for 
night sight and it'll take me days to go through each and every item *lol*
