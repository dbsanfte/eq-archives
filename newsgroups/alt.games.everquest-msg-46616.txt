I keep my Win2k install up to date by regularly checking the MS site.  The
problem occurred when I updated both DirectX, and my video drivers.  As I
mentioned, I intend to try just the video driver update tonight, at least
that is easy to backtrack on, unlike DirectX.  Hopefully that will cure the
freezing problem, if not, I can live with it, it's not that bad, and doesn't
happen all that frequently.  Hopefully Luclin will work properly with
DirectX8, and my video and sound drivers.
