I thought so too=) and separating it from epics was a nice touch. I 
think in 3 months we romped through about a dozen epics, 2 mage, 3 BL, 2 
monk, i think we lived in the Hole for a month.....

I know that there were 2 raids called for Kael drops, and one in 
permafrost using raid points. Muadd and the epic leader kept things 
running fairly seamless.

I never used my raid points, but it was nice knowing i had them. Oh, you 
could accumulate raid points on the epic raids, you just couldnt call 
for an epic raid using raid points...
