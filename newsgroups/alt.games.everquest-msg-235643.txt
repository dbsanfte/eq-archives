In the rural communities the farm is traditionally handed down to the
children. This is a common dream of parents. Even in urbania from law
firms to drycleaners... many fathers groom their children to work in
the family business. How many farmers today really "chose" to be
farmers.. and how many of them were indoctrinated with their duty to
take over the family farm from birth? This happens all the time. Is it
inherently bad? I don't think so.

The lure of the outside world coupled with teenage rebellious
tendancies would indeed prove to be a difficult challenge. But that
hardly makes him a nut... Amish and Hutterite colonies struggle with
these same problems.
