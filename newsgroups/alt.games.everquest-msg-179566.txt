More points per bandage formula is your skill level/4 I believe.

The health bar thing is a long standing bug - don't worry about it.

As for getting bandages I urge your to get an Embalmers Skinning Knife from
the Tower of Frozen Shadow, it's a piercer with crappy stats but summons
(your_current_level/2) amount of bandages (up to a max of 20) when it procs
and puts them on the mouse pointer

The mob in question - Cara - has dropped the knife every single time I
killed her so it should be possible to buy one in Bazaar if looting is not
an option.
