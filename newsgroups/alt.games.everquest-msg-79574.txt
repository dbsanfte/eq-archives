Hey, fantastic for you!  I know people that got their Jboots
when the AC was up just standing around in an empty
zone, too.

I know somebody that got a Glowing Black Stone back
2 years ago and asked in /gu "who's this Pyzlin chick?"

I have a pegasus cloak from running to Rathe Mountains
to help a guildee look for Hasten.

Would I ever in any conceivable shape form or fashion
have time to "camp" these guys?   Will I ever be able
to help "camp" Ragefire?  Kill, yes, if I'm lucky enough
to be on when he pops for a guildee.  Sit for more than
6 hours online doing anything at all? Nope.

I'm happy for you.  I've helped several guildees kill
Brother Z because unless Raster popped in the
2 or 3 hours a day or every other day they can play,
it's not going to happen.  So we grab 20 people and
kill Z.
