  Another thread (Zebedee: Online multiplayer rpg game) wandered, as threads
around here almost invariably do.  Fooboy made mention that a former roommate
had a pic of eating creamed corn out the can in an art galley (it made sense in
context, I assure you).  I half jokingly begged him to link the photo, saying
that if he did I would even put up a website called "The Faces of AGE" and let
him be the posterboy.  Two other people (Ken Andrews and Celaeno) then link pics
of themselves, and I started thinking "Hmmmm".

    I have pretty crappy webmaster skills.  I'm self-taught HTML and really only
know the basics, I don't do java, scripts, and about the graphic skills I have
are being able to do simple manipulation of existing images, such as cropping
and basic color/gamma corrections.  There are monkeys that have better skills
than me.  But I like putting up silly little websites anyways!

   The idea began to take hold.  Other newsgroups have websites associated with
them (well, I'm pretty sure rec.food.cooking does, at least).  Why the heck
shouldn't we?  Then I had another notion.  This website wouldn't just have to be
our RL pics.  I could do a section of Character pics, a EQ FAQ, post the AGE FAQ
(anyone know if that is still being maintained?), links, tips, screenshots,
favorite quotes from AGE posters and whatnot.  Given the number knowledgeable
players we have here, there should be no trouble coming up with at least some
interesting content.

   So, I'm seriously thinking about taking a stab at it.  I would be hosting it
on earthlink, so no pop-ups.  No cool domain name either, unfortunately, this is
just something I'm throwing together.  I would reserve the right to crop or do
minor corrections of any pics submitted.  And I'd love it it someone would help
a bit with the content (some of which I am thinking of culling from the
newsgroup itself, of course).  I'd submit the link for the website to various EQ
venues, but I won't be paying to advertise it.  And I wouldn't be doing anything
too terribly time intensive.  I do play EQ, after all.

   So, what do you all think?  Worth doing?  Lame idea?  Ideas of what I could
have in there? Pics you want to send?  Let me know!
