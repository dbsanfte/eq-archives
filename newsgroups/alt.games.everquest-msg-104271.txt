Ah, I took it to mean they don't group. Not saying NO druids group, but in
my experience more groups solo than not. I figured that's what he was
saying... and then, when they DO start grouping, after soloing to 30,
they're a menace. That last bit is mine, not his. :)

BTW: I've played druids for as long as I've played EQ, and I'd rather group
with just about anybody than another druid.
