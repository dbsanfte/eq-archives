I was wondering if anyone had had any problems with timers in LDoN
adventures.
I was in one last night and we were down to two minutes left (or so it said
onscreen), had just about killed our mob when we received the message that
we had failed the adventure.  When we looted the mob, it was the last drop
we needed to complete the adventure.  Not a bunch of happy campers....
