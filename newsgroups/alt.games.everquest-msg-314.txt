Must have been grouped with some really poor healers or really terrible
tanks. My husband and I both play his cleric and we have only lost 3 players
to death in 35 lvls in a group situation. These deaths occured in HK when
the tanks wanted to pull warrior room and raider room (we were lvl 26 - 32),
kept telling him to stop but to no avail.
We never nuk/stun/root unless we are the backup healer and then only to 50%
mana. Most of the time when its a bad situation (tanks drop below 50%
health) it is due to the tanks. For example, 3 tanks all attacking one bad
guy and ignoring the fact that the healer is saying "get it off of me."
Can't hardly heal when being slapped silly by the rest of the mob. Example
2,  I say "hows buffs" response "don't waste your mana on buffs just heal"
any tank that doesn't want buffs and wants me to save mana for heals is just
an idiot waiting to die. I get out of that group ASAP.

Worse is when you lecture a cleric when the appropriate time to cast a
heal is (my advice, When I lose my second bubble of health) and they
still just stand there when I'm at half health and dropping. Made even
worse when they insist on casting stun and strike more than heal. :-(
