Jim,

I've read the other responses, except I can't download Evilsofa's
posts, and there's some good tips there.  Here's my own advice:

Don't give up.  Armed with the right knowledge, you'll reap great
rewards (exp!) from Velious.

Be prepared, before porting there, with both your HP/AC buffs up, as
well as SOW (those mobs by the dragon ring aren't faster than SOW).
If you plan on heading East from the dragon ring (such as to the Tower
of Frozen Shadow), have levitate up.  Have gate, snare and Superior
Camo (some mobs see through Camo but not Sup. Camo) memorized.  When
you arrive, invis yourself.  If you're attacked, just ignore those
snow dervishes and start running to the bridge.  You'll only take a
few hits (before you run out of their range) that can easily be healed
after you zone accross the bridge.  If you were attacked, invis
yourself once you've got some distance between you and whatever
attacked you.  This will make it easier to get to the bridge.

Once you cross the bridge, there are a number of great areas to choose
from:

Head South a short distance to the "Mammoth Fields".  Why unload all
your mana when you can "ask" a mammoth to do the dirty work for you?
Ensnare mammoth1.  Charm it.  Ensnare mammoth2.  Tell mammoth1 to
attack mammoth2.  From here you have two options.  1)  Keep fearing
mammoth2, so that you can re-use mammoth1 for a number of kills.  If
you do this, it will be faster if you use Feral Spirit to haste your
pet.  Or 2)  Wait until both mammoths are almost dead (mammoth2 will
be trying to run at this point).  Tell mammoth1 to back off, then tell
him to sit down.  He'll start to wander; back up and Invis yourself to
break your charm.  One or two nukes and BLAM!  Mammoth1 is dead.  One
or two more nukes and mammoth2 is dead too.  Liberal use of the
low-mana-cost Fear Animal (or Terrorize Animal) makes it easy.  Don't
forget to kill mammoth1 first after breaking charm, because if you
don't, you won't get the experience for killing mammoth2.  BTW, using
method 2 means you don't lose 30% of the experience to your pet for
killing the first mammoth.  Mammoths will NOT join in to fights; if
another walks by while you're fighting one; it will ignore you.

Not sure if you're high enough, but near either the bridge or the
mammoth fields, you will sometimes see Snow Griffins.  These also make
great pets (they are considered animals, so you can charm or fear
them) since they are spell casters!  Druids, in fact.  While charmed,
they will buff themselves up with Skin and Thorny Barrier, they will
DD and DOT your target (and sometimes root), and after a fight they
will heal themselves up.  Just remember to Ensnare it before charming,
so that if charm breaks you've got some breathing room for casting.

On the North and South coastline of Eastern Wastes are walrus fields.
These, too, are animals, and you can use the same method as with
mammoths.  They may be better than mammoths for you at your level.

Other "animals" you may encounter regularly in EW and use charm or
fear on are: kodiaks, rhinos, dire wolves, snow cougars, and snow
leopards.  I have HUGE success using charm in EW, and don't worry
about Charisma.  Mine is 45.  With all these animals, it's a druid's
heaven!

Get levitate up and go accross Eastern Wastes to the Great Divide, to
the SouthWest corner of GD to hunt bears (kodiaks).  Although these
bears aren't "animals", and have no loot most times, they give
INCREADIBLE experience, and you should be able to kite them easily.
None are spellcasters.  Too bad they're not considered animals, or
it'd be even better.  Pull singles onto the ledge outside their caves
and kite them along there.

I wouldn't recommend using wolf form in Eastern Wastes, until you're
used to which areas have dwarves wandering around.  There's no dwarves
near the Kodiak caves in GD though, so you can use it there.

A few hundred feet south of the bridge in Eastern Wastes is a fairly
safe spot to bind yourself, if you're hunting in EW.  If hunting in
GD, bind just inside Thurgadin.

One last note about porting there; you can always ask someone to group
with you so they can invis you while you cast your port spell.  They
disband before the port goes off, and Presto!  You arrive in Iceclad
invisible.

Hope this helps, and good luck!
