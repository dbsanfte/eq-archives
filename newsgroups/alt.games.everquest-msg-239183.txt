There's a wood-elf illusion mask that's all/all.  Look up the quest by
zone in Allakhazam.  Which zone you ask?  Well, you will need to get
faction with the live frogloks in Guk by killing tons of undead
frogloks in Lower Guk.  Depending on your level, that could be a good
exp camp for you.   

There are masks rogues can use for almost every player race, but
someone already posted those links.
