Any body with an Invis and Sneak could get the potion done.  The only thing
Thurg-specific is the Purifier from the one NPC in town.  There's no items
to give her, just a text prompt to get it, so I don't know if that would
even drop Invis.

The rest of the potion can be made at any kiln and wheel.
