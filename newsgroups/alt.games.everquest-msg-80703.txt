I'm a level 19 Troll Shadow Knight (the best race and class in the
game, IMNSHO). I've pretty much hunted the heck out of the Oasis. I'm
sure I could get one more level out of it without too much trouble.
However, I am tiring of that place and want something new. I once had
an Iksar SK that I got pretty high in level, and most of his time was
spent in LOIO, so I'm still tired of that place (even though that
character was deleted more than a year ago). Someone had mentioned
going after all the humans that used to kick my ass in Innothule
Swamp, but I wandered around there for an hour last night and didn't
see one human to kill. Well...there was Dark Dethsinger (I think
that's his name), but he was still red to me.

So where else could I go to hunt? I just want to try and get to level
22 relatively quickly so I can try out some new spells. I bought SoL,
so if there is a place in Luclin that I can go, I'd be willing,
especially since I haven't gotten around to getting my new SoL spells
yet.

Until I hear from you, I guess I'll just hang around EC trying to sell
my Woven Frost Giant Beard, Drakkel Icereaver, Lumberjack's Cap, and
Chitin Shell Armor (yeah yeah yeah...I know...good luck selling that
stuff, eh?).
