When you petitioned were you told by your guide that answered the petition
that you should email your server GM?  I lost some items awhile ago, and
when I petitioned thats what they told me.  I mailed him, he got back with
me after checking his logs, and voila I had my goods back.  You mail from
the EQ home page, at a place that says mail your GM.  As for the GM event
going on...usually that is the guides of the server having a little
scheduled fun, or someone from a team that is enjoying themselves.  Good
luck dear, hope to hear that you got your goods back.
