I never said I wouldn't change and use ">".  Good thing, too, or I 
would've just made myself a fibber. :)

I would rate "But if those are what you are going to choose from, might as
well keep what you are using now." as close enough to what I said you 
said. :)

Aye, like all the folks in the late 80's who all decided to not conform 
together by wearing black motorcycle jackets, even though they didn't own 
motorcycles.  But that wasn't my intent, regardless. :)

Bah, every freak on USENET calls people an asshole every post.  That 
wouldn't be original in the least.  I prefer your 'asshat' variation.  Or 
'fucktard', that's a pretty good one. :)

Aye, except the issue wasn't just 'non-conformance', as I believe I 
explained.  It looks better to me, and having a unique quote marker served 
a purpose for me, however trivial.

Good thing my true educators in this matter are M. Vondung, Bradd, and 
Andrew, then. :) Bateau is just that guy making unhelpful noise in the 
backgroud.

True, but it's in widespread use and isn't Outlook, so I'll go along with 
it. :)
