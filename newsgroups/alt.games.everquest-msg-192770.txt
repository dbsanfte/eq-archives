Thanks for that list of files.  I have not actually purchased LOY yet.  I
just started playing again last night after a six month layoff.  It is
funny.  After only six months, my control over the EQ interface is very
rusty.  I spent all last night in Befallen getting use to the controls
again.  Nice quiet zone.  I did not want to just jump back into a zone like
The Dreadlands without some pratice.

BTW.  Where is a good zone that a 42nd Warrior could easilly find a
pick-up-group?  Dreadlands is nice but is there any zone in the POP or LUC
expansions that would be better for a 42 warrior?

Later,
