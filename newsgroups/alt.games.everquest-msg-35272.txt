Corporations take advantage of the legal system every day. When
somebody who isn't rich and has no real power makes a minute amount of
money ($600K is not even a speck of dust in the American legal system)
off of it, then I say 'more power to them'. It's called exercising
your rights. You always have the option of being a complete fucking
retard and trying to prove a point by not taking advantage of your
legal rights, but you are only hurting yourself. Don't think for one
second that the IRS would cut you any legal slack because you cut the
legal system some slack.
