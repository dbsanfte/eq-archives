I ran into him in Velks last Saturday in Velks, on the Seventh Hammer.
I didn't interact with him at all (bar fend off some lame accusations
of pulling from the Frenzy camp, which apparently is every mob not on
the ground floor), but he seemed his normal, usual self.

Tzen,
55 Outrider, Steel Thunder, The Seventh Hammer.

P.S. I heard (2nd hand) that a guildie of mine is a RL pal of his.
