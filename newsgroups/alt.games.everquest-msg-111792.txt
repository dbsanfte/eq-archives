Same totally ethicless but practical advice I have for anyone considering
such a move is be very careful and fully understand you are taking a risk in
relying on the other party to come through with the goods. The process
should be viewed as gambling....with bad odds...

Don't spend any money you couldn't afford to throw away. If you get burned -
don't blame anyone but yourself. There are a <lot> of scammers out there and
the higher the level and better the gear then more likely it is to be a
scam.

Avoid the obvious "proffessional brokers". They suck. Remember, that after
you buy an account: you suck. Don't make it worse by playing the game in a
manner to adversely affect others. Solo and don't consider guilding for a
loooooong time and even then be honest about it. It will become obvious over
time anyway. Few like an ebayer but none like a liar.
