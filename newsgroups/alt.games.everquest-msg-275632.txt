I've got this ratonga and I'd like for him to do some tradeskills, but when
I talk to the guy who is supposed to let me get into the crafting zone, he
says "I cannot permit you to join our society."  The dark elf guy will let
me join his society, but I'd like to join the one in Temple Street if
possible.  Any ideas as to why I cannot join?
