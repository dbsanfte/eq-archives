Yep, a lot of the quests aren't completable solo, even when you're a
good few levels above the things you'll be killing.

In my case this isn't a problem - every Friday night my Guild gets
together, and we team up and do the quests we need teams for.

When alone, I'm usually OK, though - you just need to know where to go
in order to hunt.  As a Rogue, however, I had a very hard time soloing
green++, who were the common target for people wanting loot, as they
were a lot more likely to drop chests.

I'm still undecided on the 'forced to group' thing - it's annoying,
and ties me into a gameplaying style I might not choose, but I DO have
fun when I team up with guildmates, and the loot drops fast and
furious when I do.

So far, so fun.  I'm staying for another month, at least.
