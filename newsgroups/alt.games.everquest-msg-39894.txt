My name is Luike nothing more just Luike.  I am a bard who has recently 
entered my fifth season and I live in Qeynos.  I have a good friend 
named Yiyoni.  She is a priest of the Prime Healer, see is in her sixth 
season.  Both of us are young, much to young for us to be doing what we 
did.  Together we went into the Karanas. Together combined we met our 
demise 27 times on one outing.  Every creature aggroed on us like you 
wouldn't believe.  what do you do when you are pulling three lions a 
rabid wolf and a bandit who casts spells.  You run.  what do you do when 
you can't outrun them, you die.  It was there that we learned some cold 
hard truths about the world of Norrath. so  for all you  newbies out 
there, and yes I am still one of them here are some Cold Hard Truths 
about Norrath:
	
	1.  no matter how fast you can run, if you have the SOW or not, lions can 
usually catch you and Griffawns always.
	2.  Cyclops and Giants will crush you on sight and you cannot do anything 
about it (atleast for those of us who have yet to past our 6th season.
	3.  You will propbably get lost, and be very close to where you need to 
be all along.
	4.  You should never stop to gawk at a stone monolith with a picture of a 
griffawn on it.  It is not there merely as artwork.
	5.  Guards rule the night. and day and when ever you need help
	6.  All the civil engineers in Norrath need to be fired.  their roads and 
pathways suck.  especially at night or at dusk.
	7. Never drag a corpse across W. Karana.
	8. Hailing a bandit is not always the smartest thing to do.  Also running 
into them is bas, as is kicking them.
	9. The rash in the Karanas sounds a lot worse than it really is.
	10. Never attack Sir Morgan, even by accident.


If anyone else out there can think of any other truths to add to make 
the list bigger please feel free to respond.
