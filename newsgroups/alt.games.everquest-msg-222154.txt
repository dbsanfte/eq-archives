In a recent letter to the editor, Kathy McKelvey equated the Ten
Commandments with morality.  While I could take issue with this
by pointing to the moral strictures of Hindu's or Wiccans or the
Ancient Greeks, I'd like instead to defend a more radical idea;
that morality is not adhering to a set of rules based on
punishment or reward, but rather comes from within.

Lets imagine that your morality derived from laws instead of from
religion.  There's someone you despise for some reason, and you
have the opportunity to kill him, but refrain solely because you
are afraid you would go to jail.  Is that moral?  How is this
restraint any different from not killing because you believe
there's an omnescient observer who will punish you in the
afterlife?

I believe it would be more moral to refuse to kill because
killing is illegal (rather than because of fear of consequences),
to refuse to kill because God said not to (rather than because of
fear of hell), but most moral of all would be to refuse to kill
because it is simply wrong to do so, coming to that conclusion by
philosophical thought rather than having it imposed from outside.

Adhering to an ancient code set up by tribal wanderers thousands
of years ago in a primative enviroment, rather than rather than
taking the trouble to rethink morality to fit into our more
modern civilization, would be nonsensical.  Adhering to those
tenets because they were passed down by God and shouldn't be
subject to change would be more understandable, except that God
does not offer proof of his existance or which of the many
differing definitions of his laws we should practice, and as a
natural consequence there are as many differing opinions as to
what exactly God (or the goddess, or the gods, or the divine
principle, or... ) might want us to do.

An amusing episode of South Park recently pointed out the folly
of this game of religious chicken; the scene was the recieving
line in Hell, and it was filled with people who felt they'd been
great catholics, babtists, 7th day adventists, so on and so
forth.  The devil checking them in said that no, they'd guessed
wrong.  Pressed, he then said that Mormons happened to be the
ones that got things right.  We on earth have no way of telling
if that's true, or if it was some other splinter of christianity,
islam, judaism, hinduism, zorasterism, norse "myth" or so on and
so forth.

I'd far rather see morality defined as operating within a
personal and well thought out and defensible philosophical
framework, than with what any one religious splinter group (and
they are ALL splinter groups, regardless of your personal guess
as to which one is the lucky lottery ticket with all the right
answers) would have you do.
