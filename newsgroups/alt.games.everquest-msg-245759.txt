Hi, Due to paying off a couple of debts, I and my partner have unsubscribed
for a couple of months.
What do you think the chances are that This will matter considering the more
time we have been subscribing for (about 3 years on and off), Do ya think
that we need to resubscribe before  signing up for beta?
It's a bit of a tight month so it would be better if we don't have to.
Basically does anyone know if they check your current account status and
base it on that or when you first signed up?
Thanks Muchly
Ceri :o)
