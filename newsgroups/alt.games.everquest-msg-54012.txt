Well, I've turned it off (see the disclaimer :) ), but yeah, just looking
for something to whine about is pretty much on the money.  Verant supports
people knowing more about my characters than I feel they have the right to.
I've gotten over it.  Doesn't mean that I'm going to avoid attacking someone
who says I'm stupid for not liking it when people don't mind their own
business and keep out of my face. ;)

Verant doesn't allow me to mind my own business and force others to mind
theirs.  In fact, they ENCOURAGE people to stick their nose where it doesn't
belong. Oh well.  I'm over it.  But I'll reserve my god-given right to whine
about it, thankyouverymuch. :)
