When does PoP become worth it?  When I ask that I mean, when does POP
become do able for exp, and not just questing.  
Ok, Ive got a 52 Cleric, 41 Monk, 31 Druid, and a 25 necro....
besides the porting options and the few quests in PoK, which of these
will be able to do exp in PoP, and how much or how little?
and the cleric really gets very little play time.

I am really trying to decide if it is really worth my money to
purchase it.  If its just for the city ports, then no thanks.

Your insight is appreciated as usual.
