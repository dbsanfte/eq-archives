  First off, it does get better.  In pickup groups, things are always going to
be a bit iffy, but at level 16 it's a lot more common for your groupmates to be
true newbies with little exposure to true group tactics... remember, there's a
good chance they didn't group with anybody but perhaps other newbies up until
this point, and have had little or no exposure to the mezz spells.

  You will encounter ignorance in groups at any level, but it's a lot less
common after level 30.  I think the "hell levels" weed out a lot of the bad
apples, or else compell them to reform.

  I wouldn't leave a low level group (sub level 25) because they break mezz once
or twice.  Anybody can make a mistake and they may not know what mezz is... they
aren't going to learn if an enchanter won't ever group with them and bother to
use the spell.   I remember the first time I grouped with an enchanter using
mezz at level 14 or so with my first character, and I didn't appreciate being
reprimanded for "breaking mezz" when I didn't have any idea what the hell that
meant.  So at low levels, I would definitely explain to your groupmates right up
front what mezz is and have them tell you they understand.

  On the other hand, if a group fails to make an attempt to comprehend what
you're saying (or are too stupid to comprehend it) and fail to adopt even the
most basic of group strategies and guidelines (like assigning a main assist and
using /assist), drop them, it isn't worth the grief.

  Also, the "sheep" zones are the worst in this regards.  They're where newbies
and twinks looking for the path of least resistence go to hunt, so there's a
higher number of idiots per capita.

  I would avoid Oasis, Highpass and the Lake of Ill Omen if you can manage it,
or hunt those areas solo.

  Also, "network" a bit.  When you group with someone who is receptive to your
suggestions (or who already knows how to play), try to stay in contact with them
and group with them again, and consider joining their guild if they're in one
and are happy with it.
