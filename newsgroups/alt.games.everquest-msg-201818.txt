I was looking at the descriptions for the various shaman spells on 
CastersRealm the other day. I noticed that one of the effects for the 
spell, Insidious Fever (19), in addition to being a disease resist debuff, 
was "Increase Disease Counter by 4".

What exactly does it mean to increase the disease counter? Does it cause 
them to do 4 extra waves of damage?
