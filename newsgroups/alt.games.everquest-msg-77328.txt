This statement does not mean she is currently 51.  It means that she has not
completed a single level in a one week timespan since the time she dinged
51.

True, and now is 55, or higher possibly, but probably not.

No, you simply chose the wrong interpretation of what she wrote, which I
will admit could be read either way.

No, Jim, and Davian, you are simply not understanding what she said, it can
be interpreted more than one way.

What she is trying to say is that she has not been able to complete a single
level in one week since the time she dinged 51.  She is also adding as
further information that it took her 6 weeks to get through Level 54.  Does
that help?
