1.  I have had extremely good luck with pickup group at the PoP levels.
2.  You have to hunt in the right places.  The courtyard camps are one of 
my favorites in PoD, Docks in PoN, or Guardians in PoN.  PoI is never a 
problem for finding mobs, I prefer the Factory.
3.  While I am LFG, I solo in PoN.  When I get a tell asking to group, it 
takes a few minutes at most to run over to where the group is.  If a group 
is not working out, I make an excuse and leave.

When I group, we take on higher level mobs, and kill them faster.  Also, a 
group of 6 gets an additional 20% XP tossed on. and that is usually the 
size of the group I am in.

It sounds like:
1.  You have terrible luck with pickup groups.
2.  You don't know where to hunt with a group.
3.  You actively go searching for a group, not soloing in the meantime.
