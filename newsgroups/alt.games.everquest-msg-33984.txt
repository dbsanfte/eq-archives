    What surprises me is that some players can't be bothered to brew at
all, even when they _really_ want the brewed products.  From time to 
time I see people in Freeport repeatedly /auctioning for bog
juice...some
quest or the other, I suppose.  One specimen shouted for it for a full
hour, then started cursing about the lack of brewers in the zone.  In
the time he spent bitching about it, he could have _become_ a brewer 
his own self.  
    Oh...don't feel like stomping snakes?  A Halfling in the Misty 
Thicket, right outside the city entrance, will sell them to you 
by the boatload.  And all he (or she, I forget which) asks for is a
couple of silvers, and that you not be too tall to get through the
door.
