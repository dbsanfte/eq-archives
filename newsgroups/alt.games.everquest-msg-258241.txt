Don't.  I don't think it's been rewritten since he took office, and 
there's plenty of other things to blame him for.

The one I love is the question "If I enter the intersection on the yellow, 
(or sometimes even the green on really fast lights) and it turns red 
before I've left the intersection, have I run a red light?  Or is it only 
running a red light if I enter the intersection after the light turns 
red?"

As I recall, the handbook gives an actual answer, but that answer was 
different from the answer we were told in traffic school, and I asked a 
couple cops and a traffic court judge.  I swear they were all picking 
randomly.  I checked my handy (slightly out of date, now) copy of the 
actual CVC, and was unable to find -any- answer.  So where the heck did 
the answer in the handbook come from?  Hmm.  The law is a tricky thing.

My personal answer would be the second one, unless I knew how long that 
yellow was and really should have known I'd never make it.  But trying to 
prove I knew how long that yellow was in court could be a sticky one. :)
