Not forgetting at all. Agro-management means dragon facing the right
way. I rarely get punted, and hold agro 100% (using Sceptre/Jaelen last
night, also used Jaelen/NevHorn with the same effect). 

I tanked him for the duration not 3 hours ago hehe. Our tactic means the
MT doesn't get punted OOR 90% of the time. In fact, last night I was
only punted OOR twice, and was instantly summoned right back both times.
Kill took 3min30sec - I died first at 3m10secs, 1 quad after disc wore
off LOL. 

I could tell he was looking at me funny, because he had 2 left eyes...

Oh, almost forgot - Most annoying dragon on ToV is Lady Spin-you-round.
I hate he with a vengeance heh
