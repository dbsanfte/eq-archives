I dont know what your server "economy" is like but on Terris Thule
there appears to be an interesting situation developing; There is
no PP anywhere. People auction for days at reasonable prioces but
nobody has actual PP; and that lack of liquidity means nobody wants
to *trade* because, well, why would they? They'll just be stuck
with ANOTHER item they dont want.

Also high level guilds now get all their items from hunting in ToV
and Velious quests; They no longer sell or buy in the market (much
, if at all) as they dont have much need for the cash raised from
selling and nobody sells what they'd want to buy.

Again, no liquidity.

So basically, at level 50 I have many items which last time I saw
the market doing anything liek a *market* would be worth 5-10k each,
but I'm damned if I can find a buyer. With the release of Luclin
coming up I expect the cash value of them to plummet even further,
and frankly, I'll be surprised if I ever see the high side of 5k
*cash* AGAin.

I'm interested in others experiences; especially if you're from
Terris Thule.
