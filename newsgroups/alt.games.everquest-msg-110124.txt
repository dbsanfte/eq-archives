Nope, nothing raises tizmak and there seems to be no reason to not
kill them. That one kind of meat they drop is used in recipe or
something, ah here it is:

http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_baking.htm

Yakman steaks yakman meat (from tizmaks), jug of sauce, spices 
**OR** 
yakman meat, jug of oyster sauce, algae spices (*yields 5) spit/oven
hearty meal; 

STR 2, STA 1 1/5* 75 

With this kind of recipe, the stats come from when you auto eat the
meat, not forcibly. So you put a stack in your top most left thing
above the rest of your food and as its auto eaten it keeps your str
and sta higher. Yield is 1, or 5 with the more complex recipe and it
trivials at 75 baking.

Their velium weapons are fun for necro or other weapon using pets
also.
