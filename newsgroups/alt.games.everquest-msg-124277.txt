Be careful. Make sure your inventory slots are all full. If they
aren't then you are susceptible to being disarmed, blinded, killed,
looted. Not a problem at lower levels, when people don't have this
ability, but keep it in the back of your head.

Also, you _could_ make a hotkey for each slot, but is that ever
cumbersome. Just open bag #1, put in items, open bag #2, put in items.
Really, if you invest in some magic resist gear (get up to about 90),
things like snares will not be a problem for a good while, and you can
always run to a zoneline (and plug, if that is your forte). What is
your character's name/level/class? I have just been hanging out in
bazaar as of late. Maybe I can help out. ;)
