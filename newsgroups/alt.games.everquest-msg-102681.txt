/em looks at the Ruins of Kunark box that was the first EQ box brought home.

Ah yes, there it is:

"Welcome to the most immersive online 3D fantasy world ever created. Join
more than a thousand other people online and experience a never-ending quest
so addictive and dynamic, you'll never want to return to the real world
again."

Umm, if the box says it's addictive, doesn't that count as a warning label?

Perhaps I am way too naive.
