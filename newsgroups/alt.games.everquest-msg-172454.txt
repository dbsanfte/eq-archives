and it has stuck, and I don't think you can muster the EQ community to
change it.  Wizzie is the latest fad for calling that particular class by
it.  If we were talking about a fantasy book, mages and wizards wouldn't be
all that different ( although the author could have them being more defined
and different as he wanted)  .  Sony / Verant has EQ has them being distinct
different classes though which is their right since they authored the game.
There was an example of someone putting a fresh face on dance by a new name
in this thread, and you willy nilly didn't even recognize the point that was
made.  Its a fresh face on something "old", and its going to continue.  its
along the same lines of political correctness, calling things new names ( in
this case to be less offensive).
Probably another reason it has stuck is that its easier to type, and still
the EQ community knows what the person is talking about.  A person with the
Last name of Qwerty designed the Qwerty keyboard layout originally so that
it would force people to slow down when typing because they would type too
fast for the typewriters of that age.   Thus, in summary if you want a
formal reason to your endless rant about this subject, wizzie is just a
little easier to type than wizard.
