Well, looking at the morons that post on the site you listed, I'm 
actually MORE in favor of Best Buy now. It looks like every moron that 
was legitimately fired from Best Buy goes on there and tells how Best Buy 
is stupid because said moron STOLE from Best Buy (gift cards, etc) and 
was caught and then fired.
