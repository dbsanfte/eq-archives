   I once ran a naked, untwinked level 1 warrior from Halas to Kael 
Drakkal in Velious.  I had made the run many times with older 
characters, and knew they way well.  I died 3 times, all before I
hit Blackburrow, from a veng.  Almost died in E Karana from a cat
on the ramp, but was sowed (I had unsolicited SoWs 3 times during 
the trip) and was able to outrun it.  I stayed on the path in the
commons, but in the west a black bear started hitting on me.  
luckily, the toll booth guards weren't on a coffee break and got
it off of me.
    The worst part of the trip was when I fell into a crevasse in
the ice in Eastern wastes, and had to be rescued by /petition.
Not something the original poster would have to worry about.
    
    To go off topic a bit, when I first entered Kael Drakkal 
there was a mob, a giant, I guess, that conned white to me.
My RL friend, who was very skeptical when I started my 
"Glory Endurance Run" and actively cheering me by the time
it ended, was blown away that I encountered a level 1 mob in
that place.  He begged me to try to take it, but I was pretty
sure it was underconned.  Not that it mattered, I was dead the
moment I tried to run past the giants guarding the entrance
to...well, whatever it was.  The main part of the zone, I
should imagine.  Too bad...I was hoping to get to the Plane
of Mischief.

   Anyways to get back on topic...Quenos to Freeport at
what, level 8?  Doable.
