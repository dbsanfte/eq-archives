No, your memory is faulty. The Ruins of Kunark CD found in retail stores at
the time it was released included the original EQ world, and allowed you to
either start a new account or upgrade an existing one.

The upgrade-only CD that VI offered to current subscribers via mail,
however, contained only the files needed for Kunark.

To answer the original poster, you must have *at least* the original EQ
world to play in Velious. You do not need Kunark. The same is to hold true
for SoL, you'll need at least the original world.
