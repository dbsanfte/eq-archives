Very funny!  My favorite line: "What's a Dorn?"

I have more money than I really need most of the time.  I've been tailoring
since I started.  A full set of raw silk armor goes for 47pp.  And it's
easier these days since the silk swatches stack.

It was fun the first time I saw a giant spider.  It was just over the zone
from EC into WC.  It was sitting at a distance so I couldn't really tell how
large it was, though I thought it looked bigger than a large spider.  I
zapped it, my Pet ran to intercept it...and it ate my Pet without even
slowing down, one gulp, gone.  Then it was on me.  BIG!  HUGE!  Agh!  Run!
Luckily I made it back across the zone with just enough HP left to keep me
breathing.

The lightstones are probably a better pay off per investment of time, but
it's fulfilling to know that there are several people running around wearing
armor that I crafted with my own delicate Magely hands.

Soon, I'll probably start working on cured silk, but it bugs me that I can't
wear it myself.  :(

I play solo most of the time (well, me and my Pet) and I've really enjoyed
tailoring and will also start some other skills.  If EQ was just hack and
slash, I would've given it up.
