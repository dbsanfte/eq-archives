lol, these things will play in my other systems.  Yes, I do supervise how
they handle these things.  The 5 yr old is good with them 4 yr old is not
allowed to handle them since she snapped the loading tray out of one
sometime back.  Yes, I've tried the drive cleaning kits too.
One other thing I forgot to mention is, when the drive actually DOES work,
when you take out the cd's they are extremely hot.  Even if only in for a
couple minutes.  3 case fans in system, so that shouldn't be it.
Power supply checks out with the multimeter.  No surge protector on system
(only one without it since it's a piece of junk for kids purposes), yet has
set there for 2 years without a hitch until this started about 6 months ago.
All computers are in same room.  Old house with old wiring, but this room
has "updated/modern" wiring.  Could the power through the house be causing
intermittent spikes?  The surge protectors in same room that other systems
are on have NEVER tripped.  This one is beyond me.

Thanks for your reply,
SEAN...
