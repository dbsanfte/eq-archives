Best place for druid info is http://www.eqdruids.com/

If they don't have it <shrug> sorry, don't know. I don't play the
class and have no intention of starting one :)

I *have* been wolf form many times though. Only one that really sticks
out for me is Gorenaire; the dragon who frequents Dreadlands. Possibly
*all* dragons hate wolf-form <shrug>

Oh, another one is the gnolls in Iceclad (from memory... been a long
while since I hunted there)

HTH (a little)
