Not everyone can walk, and wheelchairs are great solution for these
people... but abled bodied people are better off without them wouldn't
you say?

Unless your going to argue the entire Emarr community is unable to
post to usenet without this gateway I'd say its pretty self-evident
that pushing them *all* through an entirely unnecessary gateway just
to feed them some advertising for 'cheap everquest platinum' and what
not is pretty weak.
