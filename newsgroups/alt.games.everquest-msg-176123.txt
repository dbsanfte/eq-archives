Sole Survivor
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

There walked a lonely man,
silent, mute, the only man
not knowing how, not knowing why
was he the sole survivor

why should he be alive,
breathing still while others died
and the only question
why was he the sole survivor

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted saviour, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted saviour, cried into the night

Wind blew across the sand
He stood alone and he had no plan
And with the last rays of the sun
He screamed aloud, began to run

In his tears he sees his face
I am the end of the human race
When I'm gone there'll be no trace
For I'm the sole survivor

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted saviour, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted saviour, cried into the night

One night when years had passed
The skies shook from a fiery blast
And there a starship - safe at last!
To come rescue this survivor

They beckoned him inside
but only man, he would not ride
instead he found a place to hide
for he's the sole survivor

Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted saviour, cried into the night
Sole survivor, cursed with second sight
Haunted saviour, cried into the night
