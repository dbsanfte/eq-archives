Get yourself a lightsource (e.g. a tourch), and run over to BlackBurrow
(just keep heading south from the newbie ramp). You need the lightsource to
get through the tunnels on the way, but won't need it once you're there.

It's a dungeon, but counts as outside, so SoW still works. You'll get good
cash here, fast experience, and start to learn how to handle yourself in
dungeons! You get super fast experience here as it's not only good on its
own, but you can collect the gnoll fangs and either do this quest in Halas:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=225

or this quest in Qeynos:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=543


After a few levels here (to 15 maybe) have a break and catch the boat from
Qeynos to Island halfway to Erudin: Eruds Crossing. You can kill wisps here
(just make sure you have a magic weapon, and don't turn your back on them -
they're rogues and backstab you!). The experience is good, but the best
thing is the money! You can get 8pp and good experience per Greater
Lightstone doing this quest:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=374
(You can sell the lightstones for 1-2pp each, or do the same quest with them
for not as much money. You can also keep one as a light source)

Good luck out there!
