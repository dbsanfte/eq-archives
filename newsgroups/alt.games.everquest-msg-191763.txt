I said I don't break rules without a valid reason. I don't conciously
speed when I don't need to be anywhere *now*, and even then, I keep it
within reason. Still wrong to do so, true, but I accept that and the
consequences when caught.

Once again, there is no "valid" reason to break the naming policy -
provided they know it. When they don't, it's because they didn't take
the effort to learn the rules, in which case, refer to my comment on
willful ignorance. Those that do violate the naming policy usually
whine and scream when they have to face the consequences.

Next try?
