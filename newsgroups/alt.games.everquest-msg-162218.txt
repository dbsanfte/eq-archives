Well he might not....my machine ran OK on a Celeron 300A, 128meg of RAM,
an SB 1024 Live and a 16Meg Voodoo3 with all expansions bar PoP.

It wasnt great in Luclin and zonign was slow but it was fine to play and a
lot of options were turned off (frankly most gave little beneft when
looking at friends screens while they played apart from the clip plane)

Since then I have put in an Audigy which smoothed everything a LOT in
areas with ambient sound, added 2x128Meg of RAM (and find out what you
board can support) which made zoning blissful, and a Geforce 2 which moved
my clip plane out a LONG way...now it plays very nicely thank you...and
that lot cost me about 110quid (probably the same in USD terms). 

That still is low spec but its fine....so need to upgrade...hmmm not sure.
