Hmmm, now that you have a druid with you, I'm going to recommend Kedge
Keep even more strongly.  Kedge is one of the few dungeons where
druids can do effective crowd-control, since all the mobs are animals
and can be easily charmed by a druid.  Also, while I almost never
trust enduring breath, if you have a druid with you, just make sure
you always have fish scales, and have the druid cast enduring breath
on himself first, then refresh everyones once his starts to fade.  If
you're really worried about drowning, buy summoned waterstones from a
mage first, keep one in a hot-keyed inventory slot, and have the druid
cast enduring breath.  If your EB fades, and the druid isn't there
casting on you, just right-click on the waterstone and you're good for
45 minutes or so.
I really can't think of a better place for a 44 warrior, 42 druid, and
40 cleric to get great exp, good drops, and exceptional dungeon skills
other than Kedge.  It's scary and overwhelming at first, and it's
still scary at 53, but if you spend the time to learn it, you'll find
yourself coming back again and again.  Hell, my guild still gets good
turnouts for off-hours Kedge runs for epic drops, just because it's a
fun zone to play in.
