I will definitely shelve EQ for NwN for a while, but NwN can't replace EQ as
a persistant world.  The many persistant worlds people are hoping for aren't
going to happen, sorry to say.  I will play the modules that come with NwN
with some friends of mine, and also play one that a gal in the UK will be
running.  I will also script my own mini-modules that other DMs can plug
into their worlds, encounters and the such - kind of like ther Rogue's
Gallery was, except it will have more than just the monsters and contain
buildings, etc.

Maybe 1 good persistant world will come of NwN by the players, but I doubt
it will be ready for at least a year or so after the initial release.  Plus,
if it's good, too many people will be on it to make it worthwhile.

At this rate, we won't see NwN until August of 2003, though.
