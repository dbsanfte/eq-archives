Ah ok, this new list with classes too is much more believeable (though
I still doubt necros being able to cast a coffinless summon corpse
unless it is limited to like once every 2 hours)

Whoah I really like that but it just sounds too good.
What are normal 49 level charm rules?
Obviously if a druid it would be an "animal" npc. Gad though, this
would make me so powerfull.. at 55 I'd charm the highest level rhino
or snow griff in EW that I could then totally destroy while the charm
never went away (unless presumeably I'd zone)

Whoah....  I bet that exodus one is not happening though or is only
like once every so many hours otherwise you'd have no purpose for the
quick evac one.

Something I heard though is that you can only train any of these at
level 50 plus (or possibly 51 or more) and that ONE point is the xp it
takes to go from half of 51 to 52 (that is one heck of a lot of xp)

In that case about the only thing my druid would ever feel like it
could train this way would be this:

>Mental Clarity - This ability increases natural mana regeneration by 1 point
>per skill level.


And possibly that perm animal charm.
