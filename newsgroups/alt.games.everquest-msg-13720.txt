Well, it's short, but it is also wrong. :-)  If Verant wanted a Linux
version, they would get someone like Loki to do it.  Loki is quite good
at converting Windows DirectX code to X code.  The thing that makes it
so a Linux port will never happen is that EQ requires frequent and
urgent client updates.  That would be a nightmare with multiple clients.
