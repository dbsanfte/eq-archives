I reported this guy to Hotmail, and this is the response I got:

Hello kbradley,
I appreciate your taking time to send us your thoughts about the email with
virus program you received. I apologize for any inconvenience this might
have caused you. With this regard, I suggest that you always update your own
anti-virus program.
Hotmail detects most viruses, but new ones are created all the time. We
update this software as often as possible, but some viruses may be
undetected. The best way to protect yourself is not to open an attachment
from someone you don't know or from a suspicious address.
MSN Hotmail Customer Support

In my letter, I clearly stated this guy was spamming newsgroups with
infected programs. I figured since he's not smart enough to change his
address every time, Hotmail could cancel his account or something. But no,
they just pass the buck right back to me.
