Been auctioning for weeks in EC and finally made enough money "daytrading"
to get my warrior the equipment needed to stay up with the rest of my group.
Only thing left on my list, and there is no rush to get it, is a haste item.

From what I have seen, the two haste items in my price range are the FBSS
and Silver Chitin Hand Wraps.  Which should I strive for?  Should I go for
the handwraps because I can then get a Thick Banded Belt (+15Str) or should
I take the FBSS (higher haste?) and hope I run into really nice gauntlets in
the future?

What are your thoughts?

BM
