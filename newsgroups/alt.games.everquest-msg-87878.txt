It's worse than it seems...it may have been due to vote trading to
arrange the result in ice dancing.  That is, a judge may have agreed
to vote a certain way in figure skating in exchange for another judge
voting a certain way in ice dancing.

That's worse because ice dancing shouldn't even be in the Olympics
anymore.  What's the point after Sarajevo?  After Torvill and Dean's
performance there, they should have retired the sport, since
perfection had been achieved.
