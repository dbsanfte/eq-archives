In reasonably controlled situations, I let my teddybear keep me
company in Velk floor groups (Shamans think he's cute). And now I'll
even be able to keep him from acting completely suicidal - he doesn't
like spiders hitting me and has never cared that he can't be buffed or
healed. He didn't even care that I kept outrunning him when I took him
to GFay to buy Chloroblast, even though getting him up all the ramps
to the druid guild was somewhat of a challenge. I think I'll take him
with me next time I have to solo greens for something; he's good
company.
