This right here is what the entire argument comes down to for
everybody I think.

There are those who are indifferent to the spell book and those that
hate it with the passion of a thousand burning suns.  Doesn't seem to
be much middle ground.

Those that are ambivalent can't understand why those that don't like
it are so vehement in their dislike, and those that hate it can't
understand how people can not care, much less just not hate, it.

Frankly, this is a no win argument for either side I think.

Not to say that it isn't going to be argued, I'm certainly not gonna
shut up about it <insert smiley here>, but I don't see anybody
changing anybody else's mind.
