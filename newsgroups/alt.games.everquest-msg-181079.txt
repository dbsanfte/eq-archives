Well, pre 45, Wizards aren't that good (you don't even get all your
ports until 49).  My wizard just turned 48.  In the last 25 levels,
I've grouped exactly once.  Those who say Wizards are not desired in
groups are correct (unlike my Shaman who almost always gets a group
and often gets tells from people asking if he is LFG).   Maybe this
will change when I hit 53 and get AE spells.  I don't know.  Only
reason I restarted him (he was level 15 for a very long time as he is
one of my original characters) was KEI.  With KEI, the wiz was
actually playable since I could blast away and then not have to sit
(staring at a book originally) for 15 minutes.  You can't continuously
pull but downtime is much reduced and the Wiz is actually fun to play.

 The one change I would make to Wizards (if I were Sony) would be to
make familiars cut mana cost of spells.  This would allow the Wizard
to stay active casting and make him closer to a Mage in power.  The
Mage and Wizard spells are very close in damage and mana cost.  The
mage has the advantage of a pet.  If the Wizard spells were reduced in
mana cost, then while the pet was tanking for the Mage, the Wizard
could still cast making the two classes closer in power.  As I
mentioned earlier, I felt the wizard was completely unplayable without
KEI so any help to mana or spell cost would boost the Wizard.

I've only played a mage to like level 5 so I am no expert on them. 
But if you examine their spells, they are close to Wizard power plus
have pets and summoned stuff.  It is pretty much a no brainer IMHO.
