Ah yeah, I forgot to say though that on my non porting twinks whenever
I wanted a port I usually got one within 5 minutes just by offering 40
plat or more. In the odd cases where that did not work I'd offer some
useless piece of crud that I'd not been able to sell for days, this
almost always works.

Much of the time If I just busy myself and forget about it someone
comes along offering ports for donations soon. In fact now I've gotten
use to going somewhere, staying there and ONLY leaving if someone
comes along offering ports for donations.

Now my non porting cleric level 38 is bound in the bazarr (since you
can't bind in nexus) and is going to try getting around via that for a
while. It would be perfect if it just went to the big spires in great
divide also =/
