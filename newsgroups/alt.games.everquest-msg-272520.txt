Actually it's all part of the same thing. If it was simply about
pulling a creature then mages would be great at it since their spells
can hit over a long distance and thus avoid engaging un-required adds.
The problem is what happens after you have engaged. It is much simpler
and safer if the person doing the pull is the one you want the
creatures to target, without have to re-agro them.

Most deaths happen when things go wrong, like if you think you are
pulling one creature and more then one joins the fight. If the tank
pulled then they would all target him, which is what you would want. If
you aim to switch agro the tank needs to quickly work out whose got
agro, the priest who needs heals, and the enchanter what to mez and
what not. Time you done that it might be too late and half the
group's dead. Keep it simple is the best method. Get one person to
pull and maintain agro and all the others attack that creature.
