Ah, this has just come to me in a vision caused by too much artificial 
sweetener :).

Maybe they wanted ppl who would use activex and NOT ppl who would refuse 
out of some bizaar paranoia (grin). They want ppl who will do things 
THEIR way... after all: We're in THEIR world now. lolol.

PS: Mocking them, not you (plural).
PPS: OK a little bit of fun-poking at the activeX on for 2 minutes = 
death-of-first-borne ppl out there.
