Ok I need to do VSR, however I had a friend of mine loot the pulsating
green stone for me when he did this for another friend and I was not
online, and no one else needed. Is it possible to MQ this to Foloal in
FV where my friend hands in the pulsating green stone and I hand in
the softly glowing stone and I get the quest?

Anyone ever heard of that, or know if this is possible? I would hate
to have to do the whole part over again if I lost the softly glowing
stone!
