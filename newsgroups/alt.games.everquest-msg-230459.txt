I solo'd 90% of the beast epic and since gaining mine i have helped several
beastlords go from 0% to 90% done in a single day ( havent been lucky enough
to get ALL the scouts up at once), so it is without question one of the
easier epics to attain. how someone can say that they would rather use LDoN
points to get 36% haste instead of having 40% haste is incredibly silly, you
do know that the BST is a DPS class?? and anything you can do to improve
your DPS makes you a better player. i currently do not use the slow proc
claw anymore as i can cast 65% slow and can get much better dps out of other
weapons, but the epic haste will never be replaced.
