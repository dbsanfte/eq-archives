This is what I don't understand. Why should monks be able do so much 
more damage than warriors - hence be quite needed in groups, have the 
ability to feign death - hence "get out of gaol free" when the situation 
gets out of hand, be able to mend themselves - hence solo damn well, 
plus have decent HP and AC even though they can only wear crappy armour? 
It seems the monk class has pretty much superior to a warrior (who can't 
solo at all well, who has no way out when the situation gets messy - 
hence dies a lot, and who can't do as much damage) in every way except 
for being able to carry a lot of loot.

My highest level character is 41 so I am quite possibly missing 
something here but from what I see there's not really much of an 
incentive to create a warrior over a monk.
