I'm sure a level 60 ranger with the right gear could solo WW.  I seriously 
doubt any ranger can get the gear to solo in WW without doing a large 
amount of grouping.  The mobs in WW are tough, and there are a lot of 
wanderers.  I won't say I've never seen a ranger soloing in WW, but I 
certainly can't remember seeing it.

Take you higher level character to Sol B, go to bugs/bats.  Who is there 
soloing?  Go to Velks, see the guy in the corner on the spiders, who do 
you think that is?

Well, yeah, but an SK or Ranger or Pally without spells is pretty much 
toast too.  Bards do about the same melee damage as SKs or Palys, and you 
wouldn't ask them to fight without buffs and spells.

I went with one of my oldest in-game friends to MM the other night.  
There wasn't a thing in there that could hurt me.  I ran from the first 
castle train, but just stood my ground and fought the evil bastards.  Was 
quite fun and got my friend 3 blues of exp in about an hour.
