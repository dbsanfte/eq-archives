I dont care for graphics,gameplay is much more important to me,and
what was my experience with the EQ expansions? - Every expansion
graphics becomes a little better,while at the same time gameplay
became more and more out of balance(slow,long lasting buffs like Kei
and Virtue,flagging etc.) and more grinding.
Not every good game needs a highend mashine,and I repeat :
I will NOT buy a new mashine just for ONE game as long as my "old box"
fits my other needs fully and I have a shelf full of games of which I
barely scratched the surface.Personally I like turn based games,if
I only think of all the interesting DnD games from the last years
these seem to be enough for a life. :)
