Was charm kiting in HoH other day and nearly died a number of times because
of laughing. A guildy (65 mage) was in group with me leeching exp and he was
chatting to a lvl 65 mage who sent him a tell out of the blue. Questions
that we hear level 1 toons ask. He had just bought the char and was spamming
every mage he could find to ask how he does stuff.
