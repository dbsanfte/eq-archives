You still didn't explain why you don't like the -int which is statistically
meaningless for druids, we perform equally well with 3 int as with 250 int,
assuming that wis, +mana, +hp, ac and clickables remain the same.

The only time I'm encumbered is when I'm buying something expensive (15kpp
is rather heavy), there's really no reason that the 3 str on plat arms is
better than the 8 ac on Ulthork that keeps you from being hit as hard.
Besides, if you need the str for carrying something for a short time, you
get these neat STR buff spells.

Most ES items take too long to cast, and take up a slot that's better used
for items with stats (ES bp/legs have stats, so that's good, and arm effect
is better than stats for that particular slot).  In regards to the gaunts
and snare, ENsnare is such low mana that I don't even notice casting it, and
it lasts a lot longer (which is useful for soloing).  And if you really want
a clickable Snare item, Earring of Woven Bark doesn't suck.

Good point, I looted one of those last week, just not the first thing that I
thought of since the coldain prayer shawl is usually what people are talking
about.  And the fact that they sell for ~3k on my server.

Um. Right.  Othmir cap has 0 +cha and 0 sv Disease on it.  Then again, the
single thing that makes it stand out as sucking in my mind is the NEGATIVE
SAVE ANYTHING and the complete lack of HP on it (sure, it has sta, but
considering that I get around 1-2 hp/sta, it doesn't have much).
