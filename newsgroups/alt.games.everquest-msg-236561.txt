Ok done this quest its easy really - the problem comes later when you
need other classes doing their own similar quest to complete your own,
the sonic wolf bane weapon is not great when you can buy better in the
bazaar - but if like me you will do the quest all the same. IE have
reached the Journey man upgrade and can not find others doing similar
quest :(
