One newb to another.  If those you are speaking to are a different race 
it could be the following.  You are probably speaking to the other in 
your avatar's native language.  The vast majority of people do not use 
their avatar's native language but use the Common language.

To change language do the following:

1. Right click on the chat box.
2. Select Language in the menu list.
3. Change to the language you want.


You can also find out and change languages by use of the /language 
command.  By entering the commmand /language in the chat window you can 
find out which language your avatar is speaking.  One thing I have found 
to be odd is that some of my avatars appear to be speaking languages 
they don't know.
