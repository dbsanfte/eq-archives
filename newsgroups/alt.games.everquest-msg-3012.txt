My woodelf druid is apprehensive to most of Rivervale and also
apprehensive in Erudin, having done few or none faction adjustments in
those areas. I use Rivervale for bank runs, NK druid ring for selling
off junk (Tak Whistler pays pretty well), Freeport for
banking/selling/working on tradeskills - my home away from home. 
I still consider Kelethin home, as I like the place.
