I use root and nuke to solo, with Tboots, and literally did half
of each level from 44 on up to 59 soloing, as well as several
of the lower levels.

Clerics get decent nukes, and even better undead nukes, and
cheap fast roots.

I also used blind and nuke to hunt for a while, till the longer
cast times on my higher level nukes made that impossible.  At
lower levels this works great, you dont need SOW/boots
to hunt, you nuke, mob runs for you, blind it (and back off
if necessary) and it runs off while your nuke cycles, blind
wears off and it returns, so you mash nuke till it gets in cast
range, then blind again.  Problem is when your nuke cast
time gets longer you can't get the nuke and blind combo off
before the mob gets to you, if its not snared.

I've also used root and rot, up over 52, when clerics get
a DOT thats better damage per mana than their best nuke.
In final analysis this took too long to work for my purposes:

Here's why cleric solo works... I kill something, move to
a safe spot, meditate AFK.  Come back when FM and
repeat.  This means I'm constantly killing with no down
time at the keyboard; doing chores, reading the paper,
whatever I like.  Rot soloing, I need to constantly monitor
root and frequently re-apply the DOT, yes, I can finish
a fight hardly lower on mana than when I started, but my
time on keyboard is much much longer per kill.  DOT is
also undead only.  Now that they have removed the
moving DOT penalty, I'll throw DOT and DD both at
my root and shoot targets if they are undead, this will
help speed things up and allow me a bigger kill per bar of
mana... but the object will still be fast kill and long med time.

If you look my strategy over, you'll see the flaw; I'm doing
about the same thing as a wizard or druid, but the mobs
aren't snared for my safety, and I'm killing one mob for
the same effort they expend on four.  I could have leveled
one of those classes up to 60 in a quarter the time and had
the same Kill and go AFK strategy.

Try this plan with non-healing melee character, though, and
you get even worse results.  Bandaging up to half HP (or more
in some cases) means you have to be at keyboard.  Then
if you need to heal on up to full you discover that the HP bar
moves much slower than a mana bar will.  Regen races using
regen items cut that down in the same way clarity and FT items
do for a cleric, but a cleric is good for this trick straight out
of the box (well no, TBoots sure help a lot) while a solo melee
needs some mighty fine twink gear to be at all effective.
