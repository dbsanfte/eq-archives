On the Saryrn Server on the same day, they had a Batte Royal in the
arena as well for Levels 51-60. No entrance fee, and they didn't name
the prizes until the end.

The top 3 all got to pick their prizes and all decided on a Cowl of
Mortality. (2 monks and a Bst won it). I was a Level 52 Druid and
somehow managed to make it until the end. I was the last one they
killed to win the event, but the GM was kind of impressed a Level 52
Druid made it that far, considering the last 3 were all Level 60. I
happily walked away with a Scimitar of the Emerald Dawn, which I used
until I got my epic. = )

The rules were pretty simple: every man or woman for himself (although
some teamed up to make it farther) and no Invis or Hide or anything
like that. Once it got down to about 20 or so, we all had to fight on
the platform in the middle, and you would be disqualified by leaving
it. Was a load of fun, and everyone seemed to have a good time.
