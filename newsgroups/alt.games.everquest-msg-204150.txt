Actually, something for casual games that wouldn't be too bad:

Have an NPC like the Priest of Discord (call him the Priest of Accord
maybe). Turn in your book and from then on you get a 10x modifier to
all XP gained, higher likelyhood of skillups, etc.

The catch? It changes the text color for your name to something unique
just like the Priest of Discord does, so everyone knows you're on the
powderpuff plan.
