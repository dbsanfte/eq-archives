Need some help with a level 58 Shaman spell.  I just dinged 58 yesterday and
ran around buying up my 58th lvl spells (thank god my guild had Tigir's
Insects in the guild bank, damn spell costs 6kpp on prexus).  On spell I
haven't been able to find or even find any information on where to get it is
the group version of Acumen, named, Acumen of the Dar Khura.  Does anybody
know what mobs drop this spell?  Also, if anybody has one forsale on Prexus,
send me a tell cause I'll buy it off you if the price is right.
Thanks in advance,

Banala <Trinity Alliance> - 58 Ogre Shaman - Prexus
