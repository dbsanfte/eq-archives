I understand that one 100%.  I find sometimes riding both sides of the fence
that the higher guys and gals also like to clear out there bank from time to
time.  Sometime it's just being in the right place at the right time.   On
the other hand the rude little clowns that beg constantly for stuff usually
get nothing.
There's a difference between saying.  Pardon me friend would you have a few
plat so I may purchase some spells etc... and saying hmmmmmm....

Creative role-playing tends to go a long way when wanting to get something
from someone.
