Of course, EQ didn't have that at release either.  Or many of the
high level features for some classes (consider the fact that many
of the higher level bard songs were not in the game at release.)
Not too mention the fact that rogues were broken at the outset,
and enchanters were a seriously tough class to play.  The planes
weren't open, there was one set of must have chain plus armor
rather than the mid and high level class specific stuff.  Should I
go on?

EQ has had 2 and 1/2 years of continuing content development.
That head start gives it a tremendous advantage over any newcomer.

The key for me is going to be whether DAoC is fun to play with it's
release content/balance issues, and whether I see Mythic put some
serious effort into ongoing content additions.
