The thing is, if you just ignore the way Sang says what he says and
pay attention to the content, he's VERY knowledgable about the game,
and in respect to game mechanics.  The sole point of his posts are not
just simple put downs and foul language, he does usually have salient
points about the game and how it *can* be played, and in high end raid
situations, how it probably should be played.

I'm not saying he isn't a bit of an asshole, but frankly the fact that
he is one of the reasons I enjoy his posts.  Politeness can get damned
boring.

And remember, insults and foul language are nothing but words.
Generally speaking, they have only as much effect on you as you let
them.
