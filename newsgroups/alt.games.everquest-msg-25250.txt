I am, as I said, getting used to ducking, and agree that its better for
most purposes.  However, in non-intense combat situations, I do sometimes
start a cast, decide against, and sit right back down... I realize its
hardly more work to d and then click sit, but I know that just
sit used to do the job.  Heck, for a while there I was hitting d d sit
before I realized that sit cancels duck.

Also, unlike sit, there is no duck toggle button, so I can't tell
in first person view (99.999% of my life) whether I'm ducked
or not... and I see casters every now and then wandering around
in duck mode.  I know, its duck duck goose... but knowing
how EQ works I imagine there are occaisions where one or
the other d doesn't stick.  With the SIT button dragged into
all my hotkey banks, I get visual verification, STAND if I'm
sitting, SIT if I'm standing.  Now that this is crippled, I'd
like to see a new DUCK/GOOSE toggle introduced!
