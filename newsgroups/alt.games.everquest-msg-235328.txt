As I understand it, there will be at least new "textures" on some of the
surfaces.  From what I recall, they are axing the texture maps for many
surfaces and going with computed surfaces using some sort of coloring
algorithms.  These are supposed to be faster and consume less memory.  It's
analagous to the difference between describing a circle crudely with a
bunch of small line segments, or using the equation:
x^2 + y^2 = r^2, which is technically exact and no matter how close you
look at it, it still looks like a circle.  At least that's my layman's
understand of it.
