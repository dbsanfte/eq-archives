I really love you man..... and while you may not be getting in the
sleeping bag, yes..... you can have my bud light.

The new drivers got me back into EQ. Admittedly, I'm now lagging JUST
like Georg's machine is in some SOL zones (and I was just sitting
*alone* in Paineel outside the Hole. I can't fucking imagine what it
will be like in Kael with forty folks.) But the problem is solved to the
point that I can get into the game again.

Yeah. I can now firmly understand yet again the vicious level of hatred
that so many players express for VI's customer lack-o'-service
department. I had a system that was running fucking fantastic. Even on
Luclin in all but a few zones with all textures and models on. Today,
they do a patch. No word from *those* assholes about, "Oh, by the way,
we're going to fuck up half the gforce users so you can't play anymore."
Who finds the cure? VI CS? Hahahahahahahah.

The player base finds it. A fix is found and posted at castersrealm. As
usual, the players are not only the ongoing beta team, but they are the
full time CS team as well.

*sigh*.

Well, back to battling my computer and seeing if restoring my client.ini
files, etc. gets back all my preferences and hot keys or if I can do
*that* shit all over, or if I can even move fast enough to live through
a fight.

I know I'm addicted to this game now. In ANY other aspect of my life, if
I got service one tenth this crappy I'd tell them to go fuck themselves
and an HIV infested whore and I'd go to a new vendor. But for
EverCreack, back I go, hi ho, hi ho.

I don't know who's more sad........ me or VI CS. Wait..... don't answer
that.
