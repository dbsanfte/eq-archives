You mean like SOE's long tradition of making Paladin quest mobs
range in overall* difficulty from completely trivial to very easy
if you're a Druid while they range from difficult to "why are you
wasting your time here" if you're a Paladin?  (In both cases I am
assuming a character in the level range the quest reward is aimed
at.)

[*] counting not only actually killing the mob while the quest
reward is still level-appropriate, but also finding and reaching
the mob, not to mention surviving the mob's environment (adds &
etc.).

For that matter, I solo'd a number of the Crafted quests with a
Paladin back in the day, and there's little chance any equal
leveled Warrior could've done that unless twinked to far beyond
any need for the Crafted.  Apparently everybody's always been
assumed to have both a pocket dr00d and piles of $-bought pp by
the designers of this crap.

EQ quests that are interesting, fun, yield usable rewards without
demanding absurd interminable camps, and are not soloable with
relative ease by pharmers of other classes, are a pitifully tiny
fraction of the total.  It sure is fun on those rare occasions
that you come across one though.
