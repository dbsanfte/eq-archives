So whats our role?   Were not pullers.  Were behind rogues and rangers for
damage. We will be behind rogues and rangers for tanking

Sorry, but thats such utter bullshit.  monks die every day on pulls, uber
monks with great knowledge about the game can die multiple times daily when
pulling

Not to mention mobs which ALWAYS SEE THRU FD when damage is done to them.
