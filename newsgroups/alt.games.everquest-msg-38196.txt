Different people using the same account is against the EULA I believe. 
If you have a minor child you are allowed to purchase an account for
that child, but in that case you are not allowed to use that account (if
I remember right).  

> What about "dual PCing" to PL a char or port yourself etc?

Owning multiple accounts yourself or having a friend come to your house
and log on with his own account is fine AFAIK.  

If you do decide to own multiple accounts you may want to check Verant's
web site for information on character transfers.  If I remember
correctly the billing information has be be the same on any accounts you
wish to transfer characters between.
