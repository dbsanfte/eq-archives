Been seeing this a bit recently with a ranger friend who completed
the sword quest in Jaggedpine - the proc includes a pretty large
knockback - big enough to knock the mob out of melee range of the
other melee fighting at his side, and puts the mob on the other side
of my pet, so all the sudden my pet isn't on it's back anymore.  
I've got to admit, I'm not overly fond of that proc.
