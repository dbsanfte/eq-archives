I'm level 20. I'm a cleric who is absolutely sick of High Hold Pass and
the immature jerks therein. I will not go to Lake of Ill Omen because of
those creepy spider things.

Are there any other options? I want to get bigger to avoid those jerks
who don't know it's the cleric's job to heal, and they can't cast while
getting their butt munched. I would like to stop dying because they
don't know how to taunt.
