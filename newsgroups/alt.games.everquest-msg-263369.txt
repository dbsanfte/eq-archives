I'm not going to jump into this one and call either one of you guys names, 
but I will say this: Dick is right about the fact that the boards are FULL 
of complaints just like his about the game. No question about it. In that 
respect it's like any other beta board I've seen. Thousands of posts 
articulating why this game sucks or why it could be better, and then the 
dozen or so fanboys who rush to defend it with various approaches ranging 
from "It's beta!" to "OMFG I love this game and I want to have the Dev's 
babies". I think on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is 100% lovefest and 10 is 
100% flame, I would put the flame factor for EQ2 at around 7. I think the 
current EQLive flamefactor is probably around the same number, and the CoH 
board maybe 5 or 6. Lineage 2 is more like 8 or 9 and the WoW boards 
probably closer to 5 or 6. There is more controversy here than there is with 
either WoW or CoH. I'm not sure what to conclude from that, but that's how I 
see it.
