Yeah... had that happen to me when I first got Everquest... a few weeks
after I started playing, I tried to make a Vah Shir char, and it said I
couldn't do that b/c I didn't have the expansion (I did).  I had to go
through this whole 3-hr deal w/ the CSR to get my account fixed, they said
I'd used the wrong acct key, which is funny because I used the one on the
back of the CD case...huh :-\
