Pretty sure 'Temple of Veeshan' is L46+, and the zone into PoM is in ToV
so I don't think we'll ever know if there's a level restriction there
since everyone in a position to try will be above the theoretical limit
anyway. Only way to test would be for a barely L46 to take a real death
outside PoM to knock him down to L45, get a revive back in,
circumventing the L46 restriction in ToV, then try and zone in. Don't
know why anyone would bother though heh
