YOU ROCK!!!


/laugh    I couldn't let her log without persuading her to switch back to
her main (the druid the spell was for), act like I couldn't remember why I
wanted to see her main in the first place...then handed her the spell and
asked if she could use it...


She had a fit, hehe!

The spell made her day, her reaction made my day...Thanks again!

If ever I can help you out, just ask!
