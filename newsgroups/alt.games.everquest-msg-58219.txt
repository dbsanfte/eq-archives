I noticed all the halfling guild masters in rivervale
are sporting new armor looks. Looks great.

Looks like the Halflings got sick of seeing all the PCs with
cool new armor so they went on a planes raid to get some
of their own. =) Of course something tells me that all that armor
will mysteriously go *poof* if you killed any of them. =) Funny how
that works.
