   I don't think I've ever done bandits on FV.  We just hit the, what
are they, the six legged blue bug things that don't poison or run.  They
give great experience, and are largely ignored.  But you are right, the
loot sucks.

   And Kurns is perfectly fine to level in.  But you won't hear me
shouting that in PC any time soon.  I'd hate to break the idiot
quarantine.
