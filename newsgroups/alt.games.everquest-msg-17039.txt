Why not post in html?  Besides the other main reasons given by everyone
else, it is also considered a courtesy towards those unfortunate few who
have to pay by the minute for their internet access.

Longer downloads cost those folks time and money.  Kind of frustrating for
one of those people who are trying to follow a thread to have to spend a
couple of minutes downloading something, only to have it turn out to be
"Hi!" in some fancy format.
