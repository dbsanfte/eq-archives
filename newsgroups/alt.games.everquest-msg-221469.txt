I'm pretty sure he actually means charms.  ALl the Adventure
Merchants sell a set of charm slot items that give one stat but
only when in an LDoN dungeon.

I don't think I've seen an augment that only works when in an
LDoN dungeon, but of course I've certainly not seen every item or
augment out there, not by a long shot, I'm deliberately not
reading up on most of the LDoN stuff, leaving it as a surprise
for myself.
