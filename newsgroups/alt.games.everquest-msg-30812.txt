My Druid just made his first run across DL to FV waited til
i was 30, and was still about to wet myself especially
whenever i would hear one of those damn de/spider thingies (
I can never remember their names cause people keep calling
them by the name a similar mob had in D&D.).  I think the
Yetis were yellow and pretty much everything else was way
way red.
