I watched Robotech when it aired in the USA in 1984-85. I was
completely stunned when characters died. It was the first time a
"cartoon" had treated kids like they were intelligent. Unlike "Gi-Joe"
where despite millions of rounds being fired, no one ever died.

I recently purchased the Animiego DVD collection of Macross. It is the
fully restored and subtitled version of the Japanese series that was
the source of the first part of Robotech. The story is much more
mature and less watered down, and a real delight to rewatch. It does
not glorify war or violence. 

The biggest problem is that TV never shows the consequences of
violence. When someone gets gunned down there is never any life-like
blood or screaming. The shows usually just cut to commercial.
