Couple of easy camps come to mind, Osargen in HighKeep around lvl 19 but he
is easier when you ding 24. When I was that level HK was always full so you
had to wait for an opening in a group. Osargen was easy XP and he is good to
around lvl 30 but xp slows down at 27. I actually had an easier time with
osargen with my cleric than with my mage.
Hill giants in Rathe Mountains are good but you gotta be on your toes and if
an add on shows up be prepared to gate or head for the zone - I wouldn't
even try it without Jboots btw. I always had a fear spell memmed for HGs.
Single spawn spectre in Feerott, until you can handle more than one spectre
the single spawn is great xp and decent loot.
Cyndrella in Feerott by the zone into fear, another great xp grind mob, she
is good xp until 53ish. And the nice thing is she drops decent loot.

Undead spawns in kith, but be sure to con everything and watch out for add
ons. I fight next to the zone for a hasty retreat.

Mainly remember to keep buffs up and if its a casting mob keep MR up or
whatever resist buff is appropiate. Root is a judgement call, sometimes not
worth the mana. Stun is usually good choice and don't forget blinding the
mobs ( I use the low level flash of light, works just as good). Until you
are comfortable with your ability to kill the mob keep fear handy. Then just
nuke and tank.

Don't underestimate your ability to solo, everyone will tell you clerics
can't - maybe they just don't want the clerics soloing because they won't be
available for groups, lol.

Mainly just pick your targets carefully, caster mobs have low HP so are
sometimes easier to solo. Undead mobs are nice- our nukes are better against
them.
