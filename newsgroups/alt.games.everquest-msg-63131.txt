OK, so after 3 weeks including an 8 hour solo camp, I finally got Lord
Bergurgle to pop (I was beginning to think of petitioning for a surname
change to Urgle)

Shmendrik was no problem with my ranger partner, particularly as I'd
already
killed the spirit of flame, my only concern was keeping Natasha alive
while
she KS'd me.  Got the shell, ran it to TD, got the statue, ran up to
Lavastorm,
formed a couple desperately overkill groups and got the Plasmatic
Priest... assembling groups to kill mobs that are definately up is no
problem at all.

Unfortunately, that puts me back at the part of EQ I hate most, long
boring
camps killing greenies hoping for a rare spawn.  Lord Grimblox is next
on
my hit parade, which means clear cutting some segment of SolA.

I don't have good reports here on my notes as to what really needs to be

done to spawn him, just says his PH is "Large Fire Goblin or "fire
goblin
shaman" at -796, -366, on a 19 minute timer.  If possible, I'd like to
be
able to keep that spawn clear solo, will anything else aggro a 54 cleric

in there if I don't bother them?  Is there anything good to camp for
a group of say low 40s who might still get exp?  What levels are the
surrounding mobs, anyway?  Seems to me SolA has been all green
forever... but I never really explored it much.  I've got a 30 druid
alt, could
I put him in an exp/loot party and rock the place, just swap in cleric
to keep everyone else buffed and to fight LordG when he pops?  He is
listed as level 30 melee, looks like root and nuke will take him out in
three reckonings!

Well, off to get a recent map and explore some on my own, will check
back to see what people advise later.
