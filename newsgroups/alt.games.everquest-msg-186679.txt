 It is a valid excuse if you don't think sitting on your ass doing
nothing for twenty minutes while waiting for a boat (or on the boat) is
considered fun. Sitting isn't playing. If you're not playing you're most
likely not having fun. 

 If it's fun for you do it. But stop trying to make everyones definition
of fun conform to yours.
