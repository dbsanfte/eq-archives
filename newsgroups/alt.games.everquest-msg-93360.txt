WTF is about the only acronym that survived my CS days to make it into EQ in
my usage.

Lately I've been saying hihihi a lot for absolutely no reason.  Also the
habit of throwing sir into conversations has creeped in.

(examples of hihihi usage are - me getting cleansed spirit of antonica and
saying in guildchat "Cleansed Spirit of Antonica says hihihi" or getting
asked for a port in mid combat and /r %t says hihihi)
