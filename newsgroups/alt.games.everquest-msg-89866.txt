Not sure on your server, but on AB Shaded Staffs drop a lot in Maiden's Eye
and they're auctioned for roughly 50pp in EC. Now AB economy is screwed up,
but still shouldn't be much more on other servers (100 pp or such)
considering they drop a lot there.

Stats are (IIRC) 10/22 1hb, +5 vs Cold/Magic/Poison/Disease, -5 vs Fire.
Usable by practically every class/race combo.

My lvl 27 war "twink" uses one to get his 1hb up after leveling.
