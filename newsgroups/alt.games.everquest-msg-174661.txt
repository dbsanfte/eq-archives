You'll have to ask SOE about that.  You could invent just about any story
you wanted to in order to explain why some folks get Heraldic and some
don't.  For example: Rallos Zek seems to particularly favor his followers
and allows any of his flock - from gnomes to ogers - to use human-made
Fierce Herladic armor to spread the litany of destruction throughout the
land.  The Prince of Hate is more particular and doesn't abide the mixing of
races: he only allows humans to wear human-made Hateful Heraldic armor; Dark
Elves must smith the Hateful Heraldic that other Dark Elves can wear.  Etc,
etc.

One thing about the new PoP recipes is that they're much more democratic.
The armor can be used by anyone of any belief, and it's better than
Heraldic.  The only thing that keeps me in business selling Heraldic is that
the components for these new recipes are only available in those Planes that
not a lot of people have access to yet.

Well, from a human perspective, that means that there's two kinds of
Herladic armor.  There's non-deity-specific Fine Heraldic armor, which can
be worn by any human, barbarian, and high elf plate wearer.  This recipe
requires no imbued gem to make.  Then there's deity-specific armor, which
requires an imbued gem to make and alters the stats.  For example,
Salubrious Heraldic armor requires an opal imbued by a cleric of Rodcet Nife
and adds 5 WIS to the stats of Fine Herladic.  Fierce Herladic requires a
shaman to cast Imbue Jade on a piece of jade and eliminates the mana bonus
of Fine Heraldic but doubles the hit points - for example, a Fine Heraldic
breastplate has 40 HP and 40 MANA while a Fierce Heraldic breastplate has 80
HP and no MANA.

Make sense?  Most people prefer the deity-specific armor for the extra stat
bonus.  Warriors love Fierce Heraldic because a complete set can add oodles
of hit points.  Those poor agnostic souls have to settle for Fine Heraldic
with no deity-specific stat bonuses.

Hopefully that helps out.  Have fun smithing again.  =)
