Giggling maniacally and surrounded by armed hamsters, Taras Bulba <>

I better show it to you again. You seem to be having some problems
with your own post.

>>>>>>You mean compensate for "richness 
>>>>>>and expressiveness"
>>>>>>Like training wheels for comprehension.

That means *exactly* what I said it means, by any reasonable standard.
If you wish to clarify your stance, by all means do so. Of course it
does prove your own expressiveness could do with a bit of work... :-)


>>>>Are you now claiming you're not being pompous?

Note: no response, again beyond the meaningless flame.

Note: context where he is indeed claiming its *not* pompous was
snipped. Here is the original point restored:

>I hope you realise that just about all
>of the preceding paragraphs could have ended with
>a :-).

Except it *couldn't* without changing the meaning from pompous to
non-pompous, by his own position now.

He appears to have made some gruesome mistakes about my original
response. Perhaps I didn't use enough smileys for him?

Note: no response to the attack on his claims that emoticons are only
necessary for those who's writing skills aren't up to par. Is he
conceding it? Maybe, in a really inelegant way. :-)


>>>As I said, get someone to read it aloud for you,

More selective snipping at work. Noobish behavior.

This would be an example. :-)

Meaningless drivel.

I agree, however I do enjoy the process of educating you. You don't
seem to be getting it, however. Were you a slow learner in school? Did
you actually ever go to school?

More irony. :-) You have that nailed, at least. Next we can work on
you recognizing it when you do it, and we might actually get
somewhere....

The spin cycle continues. Subject is now claiming his older, more
disproven points were a "joke".

>>
>>And yet, with a few simple words

Many; it is the only thing you'll understand, however, so I have to
keep myself simple. Play to the intended audience, and all that.


>You weren't expecting something complex to

*yawn* Your mindless flame is noted.

No, I've just simply and concisely torn your feeble posts to shreds. I
can't wait to see what crap you'll spew in your petty little squirming
in the next one. :-)


>>So, does all your worldly knowledge come from the songs you hear on
>>the radio, then?
>
>Yes, I listen to a lot of Derrida on the radio.
>Know any of his songs?

Note: this was a response to a Bob Dylan quote. Subject is attempting
to spin responses out of their context in a last agonizing dance of
approaching defeat.

Try to avoid the outright lies, shlub. Everyone here can look up and
see them.

Tell me. Does it *hurt* to get this badly owned by someone you
despise? :-)

(above is the example of a smirkey)


Lest we forget, as Taras tries to hide his original points behind a
wall of flamage: he maintains that emoticons are only necessary if you
can't muster the writing level needed to express the emotions
literally. When pointed out that they are merely a convenience, not a
replacement, this spewing of flamage resulted. He refuses to answer
this point in several posts now, so we must conclude that he has
actually conceded it and is simply taking the really immature route of
doing it.

(dance, puppet!)
