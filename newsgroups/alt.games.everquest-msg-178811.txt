Try it out.  On an athalon 1.4 GHZ with 728 ram and Raedon 7600 w/ 64 mb
video ram, I've been running both a friend's 43 cleric and my 54
enchanter at the same time on the same computer.  I've noticed video lag
goes way up on the 2nd one I run, and a bit on the other one, zonning
takes forever as well.

I grouped them up, and the cleric gets some xp, but over all I think
it's slower than playing either by themselves, and I tend to die just as
much because I can only control one at a time.

I haste & duel wield my charmed pet and use the cleric to keep it and my
enchanter healed.  It works fairly well.  It would probably work a lot
better with a druid to pull & snare.  I've thought about trying just my
animation, and keeping that healed since it does dish the damage out,
just can't take punishment, but things at that level just beat it down
waaaayyy too fast. 

Another option with a druid is to find a zone where lesser evac takes
you to near where you are pulling to, find some mobs you can nuke down
to almost dead with your druid.  Pull mob , nuke down (or even quad
kite), lesser evac (clears druid from hate list), enchanter finishes
off.
