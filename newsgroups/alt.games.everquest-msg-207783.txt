With characters like that, you could probably get her to 24 with no
equipment.

Stein of Moggok is a nice. Crystal Covered Shroud is good as is a Shimmering
Orb for AC.

Focus items are always good. If you want to go real cheap: Polished Bone
Hoop, Gold Stud, Bear Hide Boots. None of these go for more then a couple of
platinum. Water Crystal Staff, 1HB processes Shallow Breath, is another
cheapie that drops off Webclaw Murkwave in Lake Rathe.

If you want something that will last longer, Serpentine Bracer and Kobold
Hide Boots are good level II focus items.

There are a couple of neck slot level II focus items that go cheap, but I
can't remember them off hand, Blacken Alloy Medalion and something else.

The Bat Fang earings<?> and Headress are good too for a chanter..
