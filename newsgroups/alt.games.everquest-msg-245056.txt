OMG... Unfailing Divinity 3 is an absolute must for a raiding cleric.
Without it, DI is next to useless.

If you can cast a CHA buff on the MT and have a cleric with UD3 cast DI,
then DI will go off just about every time it can go off.  The only time it
won't is when the MT takes a round of hits that kill them before the DI
trigger level is reached.

The difference between a cleric without UD3 and a cleric with it is really
night and day.  It will make a huge difference.  Really and truly it will.

And don't stop at UD2; UD3 is still much better.
