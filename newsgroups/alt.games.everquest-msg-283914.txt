First 'circle' - 3 people to trigger, go invis, edge in slowly, mobs 
spawn, run down.  Pull and kill mini cragbeasts, rush mother.

Second 'circle' - same trigger as above, ghosts spawn. Each ghost spawns 
another on death (one shot, i.e. ghosts spawned on death don't spawn 
another).  No 'boss'.

Final 'event' - send one person up to the riddler, get the riddle, pick 
up the objects on the floor, hand in the right one.  Get it wrong - get 
killed, get it right door opens.

Loot a key from the mobs in the next room (behind a gate) to the final room.

Get to final room, debuf Jihru, engage, dps him before he dpses you.

Jihru puts out a lot of damage.  The best way to deal with that is to 
avoid his damage using a combination of riposte discs from various classes.
