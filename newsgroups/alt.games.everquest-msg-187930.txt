    :) I stumbled on you guys once in kith when you were raiding that nashty
hut full of renegade dark elves. Managed to get myself invited to the raid -
damn that was fun <g>

    Ended up walking away with a nice nodrop shield..... Kuloth the total
stranger to HU was the only SK on the raid ;)

    I'm 52 now so if you're looking for numbers again drop me a line. Always
happy to be the sacrificial SK on anybody's epic raid.

Cheers,
James
