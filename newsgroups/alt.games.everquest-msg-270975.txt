When I used to play before, we would always seem to get missions inside the
city so running wasn't really a problem. The problem there was the
repetitiousness of it all. Once you seen the same layout a half dozen times
you could do the missions in your sleep. If they've changed it to go
further out for the missions I'd personally look at that as a "good thing".
