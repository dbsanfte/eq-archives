 I really doubt Verant will have the servers still running 20 years from 
now let alone still be in business. Not like I think that Verant is
losing money or doing a bad job at what they do but software and online
services companies in general are not exactly very long-lived. I would
assume that in 20 years Verant would have been bought out or had shifted
their focus to something other than a 23 year old game.
