It's a good job I never said that then, isn't it :-)

I just said that after a year of having it, EQ hasn't quite kept my
attention in the same way. I'm under no illusion that I've given it a
fair chance, but I didn't really want to have to force myself to be
interested in it when it does sometimes leave me feeling quite bored.
Like I said, the levelling treadmill isn't always my thing, and the
other comments here do a good job of revealing how intensely the game
can be centered on it a lot of the time...

It's not like EQ doesn't have it's good points, for example the fact
that you can play a large role of different races, you aren't stuck
being human. There's hardly any lag to be seen, most of the time, and
the graphics are wonderful. There's a lot more variety to be seen
between the different cities, and unlike Ultima Online there's a much
greater sense of achievement in doing the run on foot from one city to
another (Freeport to Qeynos anyone? Now that's quite a trek).

The amount of quests that have been coded in is overwhelming at times,
there are so many of them, meaning you're never stuck for a quest if
you want one, and the size of the 'landmasses' will keep you occupied
with exploration for hours.
