Hi all...

Sorry but yesterday was in a dungeon with a 24 Ranger ALT that I
twinked nicely, had a Fungi and a Copper Hammer among other things. We
got a collection adventure and I was the ML.

Well we were kicking butt in this dungeon there, and I was talking
here and there to another group member in tells but she just would not
stop asking me to trade my hammer for some crap. Kept saying her armor
was worth 100k and that I would benefit, etc (Armor had like +10 str
and +3 dex, I was almost laughing). I said I did not want to trade
since most of this belonged to another alt or main.

Of course I get inspected almost none stop by her and when the cleric
is oom at one point she starts telling me to lend her my fungi so she
can regen quicker. Come on! I can see if this was a guildie or someone
I had known for a long time but a complete stranger wanted to borrow
this! Had about 5 more to collect and she was relentless. I /q'd out
and left very pissed. I felt bad about leaving and sent tells to the
others about her on my main, and apparently she was pestering them as
well! Needless to say she was added to my ignore list.

Anyone else ever had this problem? I know this actually has happened
to me a few times in the lower level dungeons. Are there so many n00bs
there that this is getting silly? Next time I am going to ask the
group remove that person and we continue in another adventure (since I
assume she would still get credit if we removed her, and we won).
