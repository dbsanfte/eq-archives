No sympathy here.  If you are going to come out and say your are fucking
lazy, then, don't expect us to do the work for you.  It's trivial to find
the information on the web.  I would suggest www.eqtraders.com, they have
links there to one or two other sites for tinkering specific information.
Alternatively, given how lazy you are, just sell it all to merchants, and
people who are not too lazy to find out, will buy the useful ones off the
merchants.
