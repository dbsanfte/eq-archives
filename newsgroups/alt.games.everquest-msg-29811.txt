Thats a ok price, he must have had a good tailor skill, so he dont make that
many mistakes.
Vale armor  is a little cheaper to make than wood elf cultural, since the
materials for bonings is HQ ore, which drop from the Runnyeye goblins, so you
can hunt it, or buy from other players, the Wood elves need mithril, only sold
in Felwithe at 8pp a piece.
They can also save the 16pp emerald i have to buy, they need the foraged
plains pebbles instead.
They also only need 1 forage (plains pebble), and 1 ground spawn (Misty
Acorn), compared to a wood elf needing up to 5 forages.

But on the other hand its even harder to make than Wood Elf, since the pelts
they need are HQ brute hides. Theyre not rarer than Sabertooth. but since 100
people in IllOmen and a lot in OT hunt sabertooth, sabertooths are easy to
get, but almost noone hunt Brutes, so their pelts are RARE to get.

If they hunt the HQ brute hides and the HQ ore themselves, and forage
themselves, a piece of Vale armor can be made for around 2pp a try, but since
it take a lot of time getting the forages (especially the Acorns, finding
ground spawns is a PAIN), i would say 100pp is a ok price.

How do the Vale armor look on a human, never seen anyone wear it?

And grats on your new armor.
