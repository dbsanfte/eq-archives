I tend not to trust strange rogues.  If they're good at what they do and the
loot is near normal, that might sway my opinion of them, but....

Your best bet is to pickpocket all you can...and then /split it with your
group every 15 mins or so.

BTW, there's no way I'd allow a stranger rogue to practice weapons anywhere
near my critters.

Fair or not, that's how I feel.
