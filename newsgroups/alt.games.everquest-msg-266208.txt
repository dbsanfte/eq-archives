Chemists can be useful here.  I remember once at Caltech, someone boasted
that there was no food so hot that he could not eat it and go without a
drink for 30 seconds.  A couple chemists overheard this, and the challenge
was on.  They took every very hot food they could find, went to the lab, and
did their magic to produce a vial of a vile substance that was the
concentrated essence of the very worst hot foods.

The boaster started to pour the whole thing on his tongue, but was restrained,
and convinced to try a single drop.  He did, and was in agony.  He did hold
out for the 30 seconds, but even though they lost the bet, the chemists were
quite satisfied with the result, and happy to pay for the entertainment of
him writhing on the floor for 30 seconds in indescribeable torment.
