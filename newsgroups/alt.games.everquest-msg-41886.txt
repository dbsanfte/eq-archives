There is always a problem with attempting to translate the meanings of
emoticons.  She followed up my post with a description of her intended
meanings, and I would have to say that she is probably the one in the best
postition to know what was intended by them.  Perhaps it's just because I
have been reading this ng for a while now, but I did understand what she was
saying and how it was meant regardless of the emoticons used.

As for looking things up, www.google.com is usually the first place I go to
search for anything on the internet.
