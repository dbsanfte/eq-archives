Yeah, the bard has a couple real slow periods.  The worst are 22-27 and 
48-53 in my mind.  Not much I can recommend from 22-27, other than just 
find the level-appropriate grouping zone and power through them.  For 
48-53 though, become a solo machine.  Solo Giants in GD if you don't worry 
about the faction (and it's easily repaired), solo HGs for PP, solo any 
blue in EJ for simple, mindless exp.  Learn to chant, charm, and 
swarm-kite.  Learn to love tracking.
