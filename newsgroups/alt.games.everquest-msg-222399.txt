I think a lot of it depends on the quality of your pacify puller. Does
he always have a mob in camp ready to be killed or does he wait until
all the mobs are dead before heading out for another one? 

I'm sure people do tend to die more often in my LDoN groups. Even with
good groups, things can go wrong when you have 4 or 5 mobs in the
camp. On the other hand, on a mistake free run we'll usually finish in
about an hour which does give you a pretty large margin for error
(time wise) when things go wrong.

I did one LDoN run this weekend with shaman, pally, monk, ranger,
necro and mage. Three of them people I'd never grouped with before so
we weren't used to each other but they all turned out to be excellent
players. I know the pally who was main tank doesn't have any of her
defensive AAs but still, a 58 druid could've kept that group healed
easily. Things were dying so quickly that the MT only needed a heal
ever couple of fights and even 4 pulls were trivial. Without KEI, I
pretty much ran through the entire dungeon FoM. Having Quiessence
makes it easier but I don't think it could be considered a
requirement.

Three or four mobs taking damage from a (group) DS at the same time
will up your efficiency.

About the only thing DoTs are good for in LDoN is grabbing agro from
an add. Adds will live long enough for the DoT to do full damage. At
least for a shaman, the 5 tick LDoN DoTs do seem to be pretty useful,
but that's because our DD and Rain spells suck compared to the real
casters.

This weekend was the first time I did a serious push in LDoN, 7
adventures over 3 days (I only had about 16 wins going in) and quite a
few were with partial pickup groups, 2 or 3 people that I knew. Some
of the people we picked up were guilded, some weren't (and the
unguilded one turned out to be a BST with 8k hitpoints that had just
quit a PoTime guild, go figure) and they all turned out to be good
players. No idiots, nobody did anything stupid, no arguements over
loot (NBG), it seriously resored my faith in pickup groups. 

Rgds, Frank
