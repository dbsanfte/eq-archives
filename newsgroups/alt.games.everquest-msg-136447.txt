I gave you the courtesy of replying to your points.  You don't like
the replies, and that's fine.  Just be man enough to reply to what is
in front of you instead of evading the issue with petty accusations.
Don't you have any pride at all?  A whole newsgroup is laughing at
you!   Not because they disagree with you, as you like to believe, but
because they see your pitiful inability to answer to any criticism or
differing opinion.  Poor little EQ, so desperate to meet his needs as
a masochist that he's reduced to engineering public humiliation for
himself!


Speaking of your humiliation, I noticed that since your obsession has
shifted to me, you have stopped complaining about those so-called
"terrorists" of yours.  In fact, your little friends seem to have
disappeared now that you're busy elsewhere.
