Yes you can, but only if you've 'unlocked' the camp by making and spending
enough points there.

Example:

You have 100 points in EC, 500 points in Butcher, and 50 points in NRo

You have 650 points total to spend.

The first thing you buy is a 50 point item in EC.  You can now use the other
600 points you've made in other camps in EC, but cannot buy items worth more
than 50 points.

So you need to unlock a camp completely by buying a 1492 point item there
first.  Only then can you buy anything at that camp with points from other
camps.
