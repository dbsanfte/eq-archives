I have a level 11 Ogre shaman alt who I have been ignoring for the past few
months.  I have been playing my rogue main whom I enjoy very much but I'm
getting the itch to maybe play my shaman up a few levels (at least to 14).
I have him in mostly banded with splitpaw gloves but thats about it.  I
spend most of my non-eq playing time researching rogue related quest and
information, so I am lacking in shaman and caster in general knowledge.  I
need some advice.  I want to dump some plat into the shaman (maybe 500pp to
1k) and get him as fully equiped as possible.  Any thoughts?   Also, are
there any good items that I could easily get using my 39 rogue, which could
be passed on to my shaman?
