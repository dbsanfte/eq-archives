We were doing this last night. A guildmate Necro and my Druid were at
the Aviak tower in SK. Don't forget the value of track in finding the
right mobs. We could pull from the top of the tower by parking the
Necro off to the side, then having the Druid harmony the tower top.
Single mobs pulled right over the side to the waiting necro.
Snare/darkness kiting away from tower worked best. No pet, we finished
full health and half mana each even after red Avocets. We were both
25th level. 
Necro kept harvesting health for mana, and I kept healing him for a
net gain, downtime was almost null. We dropped the pet because it did
little to help. 
 The occasional lion add just became a pet for a bit, then it died. 2
HQ pelts this way ;)
 I tried charming elephants and sending them to ravage darters, but
this turned out to be a slower exp gain.
