I wouldnt try soloing cynthia with a level 35 druid. She would blow you up
well before thorns or dots or your own nukes would do any good. Id also be a
bit uneasy about soloing the troll guards there. With the way spells are
seldom resisted, I wouldnt want to be fighting shamans. For the original
poster... maybe play another class for a while, and then coming back to your
druid with sow, ports etc will be a blast until you get sick of it again.
Another place thats ok at 35 is iceclad, and it certainly makes for a change
of scenery. Those small ice islands are good for kiting an medding. Dont use
wolfform near the dwarves.
