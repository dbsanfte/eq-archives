It's organized by a public calendar, off the server webpage at
www.innoruuk.com  Anyone can read the calendar, an authorized guild
representative can schedule on an open date, and innoruuk.com staff
can modify it in case of scheduling conflicts due to bugs, time zone
differences, etc.  
The rules were decided on by a consensus at two summits, and are
modified as required.  Three planes-capable guilds has stated that
they no longer abide by the summit, and I have seen them in Hate/Fear
when they are not scheduled.  There is really no way to enforce it
other than peer pressure, so generally other guilds have generally
agreed to not assist any guild that violates the summit.
It's not a perfect system, and there are plans for it to be revisited
in about 3 weeks, but it seems to work a lot better than no system at
all.
