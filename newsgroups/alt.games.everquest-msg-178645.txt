Not sure why you need to go to the old UI, but you can't.

You can make the new UI look alot like the old UI with the /viewport 
command. /viewport 0 0 1280 800 is what I use to get all my information off 
the screen with my UI changes. It gives me a nice wide view and keeps all 
my windows at the bottom.
