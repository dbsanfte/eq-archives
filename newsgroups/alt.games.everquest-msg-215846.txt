No, I was there. We didn't wipe because we got fucking lucky. That was
the primary reason by far. He almost died once when he bone-headedly
set off a trap in his face. The shaman wasn't at fault, either. All he
was doing was healing.

Rushing may get the mission done quickly if you're lucky, yes. But
it's stupid, because if you're not lucky, it gets your asses handed to
you in a sling.

The big concern is, if the group (ESPECIALLY the only healer) says
that you need to slow down, slow it the fuck down. Don't stand there
and bitch at them over it. And if you're so bad at paying attention
that it takes someone 5 /gsays to get you to notice that she's asking
where everyone went, you're a bad puller. Period.

The group surviving isn't the end-all determination of whether or not
the puller or even the group as a whole was good. A god-awful group
can survive with enough luck on their side.
