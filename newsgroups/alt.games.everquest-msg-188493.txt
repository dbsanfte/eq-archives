I've played all that are out now, and just started playing EQ again with 
a new account/character after almost 2 years of not playing.

> Everquest

Heavily leans towards combat, but in a social & adventuring/exploring 
way. Grouping is encouraged, but not necessary for most classes until 
higher levels and even then many classes can still solo.

Tradeskills are there and many people enjoy them, but they are somewhat 
tedious and repetitious.

A very alive and HUGE world with many, many things to see.


> Asherons Call 2

Good idea, gone horribly wrong. Dead world with good graphics and no 
soul.


> Dark Age of Camelot

EQ "lite" with an end-game approach for RVR (Realm-vs-Realm PVP) combat. 
Fun doing RVR, but really, really boring to level and from what I 
understand you now have to be 50 to even think about RVR really. 


> Wait For Everquest 2

Depends on how long you want to wait. This game will not be out for at 
LEAST another year, most likely not until Christmas 2004.
