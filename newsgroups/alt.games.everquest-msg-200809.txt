Simple answer would be yes . Necros are very good at soloing and are
suprisingly powerfull played well in a group. Bards are better at both .
Clerics are MUCH better at raiding and grouping. Chanters are better at
grouping. Shamans can kill things outright that you have to fear kite.
Druids can solo anything that does not summon though they do it slowly.
Wizards can kill 4 of what you are so proud of at the same time.

No it dosent get much harder to kill mobs . The rate of gain from such
killing goes from small to miniscule.
