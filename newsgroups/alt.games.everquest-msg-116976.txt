 Why? Because you have to actually rely on someone else to res you.
Something that can't be guaranteed. Most other places you can run in and
get your own corpse or at least easily get back to it with a group or
less. 

 Having said that I'd also vote for PoM as the worst place to die. Maybe
before it was nerfed to hell it wasn't that bad but now I don't know
anyone bound there anymore. Not to say there isn't, just nobody I know.
