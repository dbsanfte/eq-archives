I just picked up 3 Items in Old Seb, and I can't seem to find info on the
quests they are used for? I looked on 2 of my fav. sites to find something.
They both list 2 of 3 of the items, but don't tell me what the quests are,
and how to uae the items.

I have a:

1)  Sphere of primal elements

2) Undead froglok spine

3) Small froglok bone vial

if anyone has info on the quests they are for, if an enchanter can use any
of end items. If the fianl prizes are no drop, and where the quests start. I
would really appreciate any info, so I know if I should destroy them, or
work the quests.
