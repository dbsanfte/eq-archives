Cazic Thule is great.  Can crawl to the top of the 4C pyramid, do the 
ring of fear event, ring of slime, walk the gnome, crawl the sewers, 
spawn the dragon.  Should all be fairly trivial for a bard/bst combo, but 
I have fun in there still.  Just watch for huge pulls from nowhere ;)

Plane of Hate is fun if you can ignore the lag.  SEoC MQs still sell very 
well on Karana and the Marsinger quests have decent rewards too.  I 
really like the atmosphere there too :)

Hate's Fury is a neat crawl with fun little drops for twinks.

There's a triggered event in Nadox you guys could probably do, near the 
Torgiran zoneline.

<Channeling the spirit of Briarly> Get your Mark of Justice!  (Complete 
all 6 PoJ trials, gives access to 7th Hammer.)

You could work on Key of Veeshan (the old quest is a bigger timesink, but 
more fun I think) and try to get some rotting blood from the dragon in 
Skyfire.  Some nice quests in there with great rewards for the effort, 
and they take you to all sorts of out-of-the-way zones (a few of these 
are my latest project, along with raising faction in mistmoore).

With a group you could probably do Halls of Testing in Temple of Veeshan 
and Kael arena to get your CoV faction up.  Some of the HoT quests have 
very nice rewards even by today's standards.

Howling Stones could be fun.  Never been myself but guildies love it.

Those are things I've found enjoyable (with the exception of HS, as I 
haven't been there) that you might as well.

HTH,
