You get my vote, too.  I *like* the fact that a druid is not a cleric.
Sure, sometimes I wish my druid's HP/AC buffs were better, or that I
could rez, or of course do bigger and better heals.  But that's part
of the tradeoff of being a druid -- I get other abilities that *ought*
to make up for the clerical abilities I'm missing.  And to be sure, I
enjoy the mobility of port spells and SOW, and having a wide variety
of buffs, and so forth.

The solution, as many have already said in response to the OP, is NOT
to make all classes the same within a given archetype, it's to design
encounters so that there isn't any single class or combination that is
"ideal" for the vast majority of encounters.  Sure, let there be times
when you really need a cleric (or else have to be really good or lucky
or both), but have other encounters where a druid is more useful than
a cleric, or even encounters where you don't particularly need a healer
at all but really need crowd control (and again, encounters should vary
as to which crowd control class is best).

In short, the solution to class balance is MORE CONTENT.  If you don't
have the right class mix to take on certain targets, who cares?  There
are lots of other targets; pick one more suited to your abilities.  And
ideally, this should include multiple paths through an expansion; e.g.,
different GoD trials could be easier or harder depending on the classes
you bring to bear, and there shouldn't be ANY single class that's
clearly the best for all of them.  Sure, you might need a generic
trinity (tank, healer, crowd control), though ideally I think it would
be better if there were ways to make up for the lack of any one part of
the trinity.  But for any reasonable set of classes, played well, you
should eventually be able to get keyed or flagged or whatever you need
to advance to the next level of content.  And if you fret that there's
content you missed because you only followed one advancement path, hey,
roll up another alt and go back and do it a different way!

I'll even go a step further and say that this could also be the answer
to the "problem" of balancing encounters for raiders and non-raiders.
Yup, they have different equipment.  So what?  Have some content aimed
at raid-geared groups, and some not.  I'm not raid-equipped and likely
never will be, so that would mean there's content I'd never get to see.
As long as there's plenty of content that IS appropriate to my level of
equipment, I'm happy.  And of course, if I play long enough, I can hope
that at level 70 with single-group gear I can at least handle the
content that was challenging to raiders at level 60, or whatever.

Part of this does come back to the problem mentioned by another person
in this thread: many players just want the reward, not the challenge.
So if some content is designed for non-raiding players, they can get
their raid-equipped friends/mains to come mow through it.  Well, if
that's how they want to play, why should I care?  When I come to that
content, I'll tackle it with my meager bazaar-twink gear, and I'll have
a blast, win or lose.
