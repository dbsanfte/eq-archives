I am seriously after the focus effect, as imp heal 4 is available on:
# ceramic totem of the rathe - takes planar drops, ceramic tradeskill, 
trivs at 250

# gleamscale cape, chardok drop, seriously expensive in bazaar, and i 
would have to replce my lodi shield with it

# knucklebone beaded veil, drops off terris thule. in my guild? raid? 
dont make me laugh...

# mantle of flamewisdom, drops in doomfire, see above=\

# polished smoothmetal torque - PoI, PoD. never seen one drop any time i 
was there, and dont think i will get one. my guild barely groups 
together let alone organizes anything...and i generally only get invites 
to LDoN any more.

# Primal Mask of the Earthcrafter -  PoE. yeah, right. see above.

# Scaled Avatar's Sleeves - shammy only

# Splinted Grimlinghide Cloak - raid event acrylia. need i say more.

# Trydan's Armplates of Nobility - pally only

# Vambraces of Vengeful Fury - what i want to make when i can afford the 
mold in bazaar/auction

# Veil of War Wise Eyes -  drops in drunder, needs a raid force.

# Wanderer's Sylvan Sleeves - druid only

As with all upgrades, there is a tradeoff=) I lucked out and got the 
elbow spiked armplates for 10k as the person who sold them to me got 
lucky and got the ornate mold, and we were both happy as they replaced 
my donals arms which i then passed on to a friends baby cleric. I know i 
am not yet 65, and so imp heal 4 is sort of moot, but if i upgrade to 
them when i get the chance, then i dont have to upgrade them again=)

I am slowly upgrading, at 46 i had the full set of donals [except the 
BP], which was a LOT of work though very much worth it. i will probably 
never have a 'full set' of anything, as no one set has everything i 
want...though i still have a full set of sol ro quest armor on one of my 
cleric alts that i did when aru was upper 30s=) and i do actually try to 
do the complete newbie armor/weapon quest with all my alts as i like 
doing quests.
