Check out casters realm. There are some solo hunting guides there.
Can't you start to quad kite at 35 ? (I'm still stuck in 30)
I have been soloing in FM at 30 and those goblin casters are nasty, but
you should be able to root dot near the entrance quite easy. There is
also a "safe-ish" spot near the giant fort. Just make sure that the
groups hunting there don't train you (and that you don't train them)

Hth,

Jim
