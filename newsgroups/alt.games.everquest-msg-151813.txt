Just an FYI... not everyone starts with th same faction.  In regards
to Shadow Haven, Nexus, and Bazaar this is true.  But Iksars appear to
be KOS in Katta Castelium and in Sanct Seru.  I believe this is the
same with any evil worshipers (not sure on this fact).  Sanct Seru is
full of overly ritious individuals... they left the others because
they did not want Evils (Dark Elves, Ogres, etc) to be part of the
City Plan.
