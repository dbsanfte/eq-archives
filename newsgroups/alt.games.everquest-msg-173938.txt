I agree. I went to PoI with a 50 cleric, 52 chanter, 52 monk, 53 warrior, 51
pally, and me 53 druid. My AA really flew past. I also tried normal xp and
that was pretty good too, about 1% a kill. I'm really going back tonight for
some more action. Hope to make a yellow or 2. :) Just make your own pickup
group and do the entry mobs. They hit hard tho, so a slower is a must.
