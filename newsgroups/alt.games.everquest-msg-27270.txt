I agree with you.  This arguement started about healing, not reduction
of mob damage.  Where does my mage fit in as a healer?  I put a damage
shield on the tanks so that the mob stops fighting to run away sooner.
I put a pet on the mob, so the player tanks don't take damage and the
mob starts to run faster.  I summon bandages and use them well.  I
blast the mob almost as well as a wizard so they stop hitting to run
away.  
Perhaps the wizard is the best healer.  He snares and blasts it.  His
HP's aren't touched at all if he has room to kite.
