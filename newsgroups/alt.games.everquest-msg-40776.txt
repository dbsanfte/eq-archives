Hee hee, I camped before a patch fully buffed and ready to go.
Logged in straight after the patch and x-ed him in about 5 seconds.
2 mins later as I'm headding to the bank I hear a shout "Anyone seen
Dylan"
Shame :-P

Time to cast buffs : 2 mins
Time to /camp : 30 seconds
Time to kill Dylan : 1.5 mins
Total camping time : 4mins !

Hee hee.
