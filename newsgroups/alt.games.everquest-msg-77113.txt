Nice spin-doctoring...

Try "I don't like FLOODS of popups, so I'm not going to encourage
their doing it to other people by giving in to their demands". Yeah,
they'll still do it, but I'm one less person making them think their
tactics are working.

Like I said, a popup here and there is fine. 3 or more on every single
page change is absolutely ridiculous.
