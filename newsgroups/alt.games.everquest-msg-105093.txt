Ahaah well said. Besides, druids ARE wanted for guild things. Druids
DO have certain abilities, like resist circles, which ARE needed that
no one else has. Druids DO have a good, small and fast heal in
chloroblast (I've saved more enchanter's asses on raids without
generating any aggro myself than I can remember) I play a 56 druid in
a raiding guild and I don't see a damn thing wrong with them. I love
my class and I love my epic.

Their post about what druids "need" is such utter crap. We don't need
a damn thing and are one of the best classes in the game. Our epic is
a damn fine holdable, the best that we have, and its right click
affect sure makes manaless soloing possible (or the killing of mobs
solo which just would not be worth it otherwise, such as elysians) 

It is more accurate to say "solo multiple blues" though. We can't solo
multiple whites very well at all but at level 56 being able to solo
four blues at once kicks much ass.

Like you I think shadow knights and paladins really DO need abilities
which make them wanted on raids, they currently don't have any if you
have the full compliment of other classes there. Essentially I could
take the paladins and sks at any of my guild raids and replace them
with warriors and no one would know something was differernt and we'd
probably do better. Even their aggro getting abilities only work in
smaller group situations while on my guild raids the mob is either
beating on the master tank, a cleric or an enchanter.

Druids WERE one of the best solo classes in the game. Then they gave
them some pretty kick ass abilities for groups and raids. They already
WERE improved greatly.
