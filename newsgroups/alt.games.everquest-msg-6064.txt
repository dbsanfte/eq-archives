I just pulled this off the new Luclin website and it disturbs me because it
is a lie :(

<snip>
3.0 Who are the Vah Shir?

The Vah Shir are a race of noble cat people that were wiped off Odus and
deposited on Luclin many years ago in the test of a great weapon by the
Erudites. The weapon, aimed at the Vah Shir home city of the same name,
flung the entire city and the inhabitants therein through space, leaving
what is now known as The Hole. Without their nobility, the remaining cat
people, dubbed "Kerrans" by the Erudites, were easily rounded up and
segregated to Kerra Isle.

<end snip>

Everyone who has read their Odus history knows that the Hole was created
during the war between the Erudites and the Heretics and that Old Paineel
was what was destroyed and left behind the hole.  You can get that
information by reading the books in the Paineel library.

So why change a known historical fact?
