Oh, in my earlier post on the subject I forgot to add.  At level 4, my
defense is 13, my offense is 3, my 1hb is 4.  Not quite sure how that worked
out, I was attempting to hit the mobs, usually with little success, and was
getting hit a lot.  I definately have some issues with where my skill levels
are, and where they will be at level 11.

My casting skills are equally pitiful, although Evocation is pretty good,
Strike is pretty nice.  Let's see Alteration I think for healing?  Why
bother, I'll repop ready to fight.  It's too bad I can't just bind anywhere
in Nektulos like playing in Gfaydark.
