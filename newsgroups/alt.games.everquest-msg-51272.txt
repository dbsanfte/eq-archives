Well, I have a 27 Druid as my primary, and I can recount some of my
experiences.  There are occasions where I have to serve as primary healer...
But my tactics vary from day to day... Usually, I will keep the tanks
Skinned..  And, once a battle starts, I thorn the tanks...  Then step back
and heal people as they need it... I take care not to "uber-heal"...
Basically, just heal until they're not in danger of dying any time soon,
step back, med...  and once they get down to 2 bubs, start healing again....
I rarely get aggroed, as long as the tank does their job and -taunt- the
mob....
