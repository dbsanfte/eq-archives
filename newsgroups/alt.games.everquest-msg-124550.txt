Or: "God was I dumb".  Or: "I've earned my lesson".  
Jerkoff sends me a tell in EC last night while I'm trying to sell some stuff: 
"Can you go pick up my bard from Kelethin?  I'll pay you 40 PP."
I'm thinking nah... I have a lot to sell and a lot I wanna get done.  He asks
again, reallllyyy niceeee... purty please...
I send him a tell, "I can't port to Fay, only to Butcherblock, can he meet me
there?"
Guy responds, "he's only level 3 - can you run over and get him?"
So, gullible me.  I port to butcher and run over to Kelethin.  He logs the bard
on.  I Sow him and port him to Commons.  He asks if I can run him to Freeport
to bind him.  I run across WC, EC and into Freeport to bind him.  He tells me
to run Back to WC, he'll log on his main and pay me.  
A half hour later I'm finally face to face with Jerkoff.  And he hands me 25
PP!!
Says he's sorry thats all the cash he has on him.  Ok, Jerkoff, you knew you
only had 25 PP when you asked to start with.  Loser.  
Fool me once, shame on me, (especially after all I've read here).  I'm sure
yall will understand that in the future I'll only be porting *after* i get
payment. (I know, I know, it's my own fault....)
