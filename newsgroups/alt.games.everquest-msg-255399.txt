    It's all about progress. If second best loot wasn't on the near-endgame
encounters, why would anyone do that content? Skip it and go straight to the
endgame encounters, which don't apparently require anything better than
second best loot which you already got putzing around in LDoN or something.
That's why group stuff will never be at "near-endgame" quality - it would
allow people to skip massive parts of new content. Welcome to Mudflation
101.

    At the moment, there is no "4th best..." category. Pretty much anything
you see in The Bazaar that's droppable is actually type 3 loot, or would fit
into your type 6. Even stuff that used to be raids (Kunark dragons, CT Ring
of Slime event, Zlandicar) is being farmed by single groups now, even if
those groups are raid-geared. Type 5 is also a non-factor.

    The best hope for this is to get an area that can be accessed by people
doing single group trials which don't require raid-only gear to complete.
Oh, wait - that's what the most recent expansion has! And the number of
people taking advantage of this has been... hmm. I see.

    I think one of the problems has been differing expectations on the part
of non-raiders and raiders. Take the GoD progression, for example. As a
raider, I know I have to gear up in zone X before I can hope to succeed in
zone Y. This has been part of raiding since day 1. So I take the losses and
the farming, return to zone X again and again, and eventually have good
enough gear to progress to zone Y. Non-raiders don't see the same farming
requirement in their day-to-day play. They assume that they'll obtain what
they need as a consequence of going to the zones they normally XP in, which
didn't require anything more than what they earned in the previous XP zone.
They don't have a farming mentality. So I look at the sewer/Vxed/Tipt trials
and I see a natural progression. Anyone that had spent time in the GoD zones
prior to those, farmed until they were geared up, then farmed the trials
until they were geared on those should be more than capable of passing them
based on the sorts of people I've seen complete them. The non-raider sees a
trial he knows he cannot pass as he is today, doesn't have the time to spend
gearing up for those trials or isn't aware of the one-groupable drops
available that would allow him to gear up for those trials, and gives up on
the whole thing as being for raiders only. Just because a raider can get
through a set of trials first time through because of their gear does not
mean that only their gear allows one through.

    Even if that perspective is a wee bit skewed. ;-)
