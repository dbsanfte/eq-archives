Pro's for the TS armour pieces

It's always as good as or better than the old Sol Ro quest armours...Except
maybe the Ranger Tunic.
The armour has appropriate Stats for the class....none of this giving
Warriors Wisdom and Charisma, stuff.
The Plate pieces are wearable by Iksars.
The caster tunics/robes are very good for the level they are aimed at.
They don't cost anything, you do not need to provide a couple of hundred
plat in gems.

Cons
The Mnk and Bst Tunics are poor when compared to Acrylia Leather pieces.
All the weapons are useless for the level they are aimed at.
Many of the spawns are very rare, even the stationary ones that you have to
just kill one spawn over and over again to get him to pop take forever. The
druid one in particular is broke (imo) since to be able to pull him you must
kill the Sambata Worker in the centre (he will aggro) and he is the place
holder for a 60th level Necro...Like the mid 40's Tribal Hunter at the back
of the cave wasn't tough enough.
These are aimed at high 30's to mid 40's and you will need a good group to
hunt the zones required.
Some of the Mobs I would not want to face at the levels you'd find the
armour useful...eg..Tro Jegs in SD...250pnt Firebased DD, Shadows in
TS...150pnt lifetap...Spirespirits...high 30's - low 40's Necro's that love
to Fear.
You will need a tracker for the Wandering mobs spawns and as you kill more
and more of that type of mob you will find yourself KoS to something that
may have been neutral until you started slaughtering them.

The real problem is the level they are aimed at. To get these at the
appropriate level you are coming to the end of the mid level range, you
would need a decent group of hunting friends or some supportive guild mates
to keep going after these drops and to be honest, you'd do better getting
yourself through the forties and into the low end raid levels than wasting
time on these :ï¿½/

Also, if you are looking for pieces, check the Bazaar, often the more common
pieces are up for sale and sometimes even the rarer, chest slot pieces are
too.
