When my troll was still in the newbie stages, I ran into all sorts of
ogres in Innothule Swamp (your neighbor newbie area one zone over.)
Everyone seemed to agree that from 1 through 5 or 6, the troll newbie area
is a far more target rich environment, and you can bash your way through
those levels quickly.  Then around six or seven, go back to the Feerott,
up to the Northwest corner, and camp the skellies at the ruins for several
levels of great xp and backpacks full of bonechips that you can save up
and sell to passing high level casters for plat to buy your first magic
weapon. Just watch out for the occasional zombie that spawns. When the
skellies green out on you, you can go back downriver a bit and camp the
lizardman camps. When they greened out I headed to oasis for caimen,
crocs, deepwaters, etc. Very fast leveling that will take you from 12 to
19 or 20 whether solo or in groups, and still not to far to run back to
Grobb for shopping and banking.  Good luck.
