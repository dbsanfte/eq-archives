That's been my experience on The Nameless, the two or three times I've shown
up for General raids.  Invite as many rogues as you know (or announce it in
your server message board), and with the rogues all bringing guildmates and
friends, you get enough people that it is basically a trivial raid.  The
only thing people have to do is pay attention, so that if someone accidently
aggroes whatever you are leaving up, everyone can run to the zone to clear
aggro, rather than fighting and killing it.

The raids have tended to turn into basically a guild party, with people
talking and joking, and occasionally going over and fighting whenever the
next rogue is ready.
