I have been enjoying EQ off and on for almost 2 years now.  Does anyone
think latex masks of various characters would be a hit with the EQ crowds?
I run a site called www.latexmaskcentral.com and want to join my 2 hobbies
by creating some really cool masks of some of the characters.

If you venture over to my site, send me an email if something like this
would interest you.  I make masks on a limited run basis (5 copies or so)
and if enough of an interest exists, I would be happy to make a few with
some of your input.

              thanks
