I can't disagree with any of this.  

I just feel that, if you want to introduce such a "baggage-laden"
concept as HIV and AIDs, then a children's show geared towards
learning your ABCs and 123s is not the place or forum to do it.

You are partially correct.  I did introduce the 2 yr old concept,
while mistakenly believing it was the lower end of the Sesame Street
target audience.  

However, this does not change the fact that it was Lena et al who
STILL supported the idea of teaching HIV and AIDs, even to that young
age..

So, in other words, I, unintentionally, ran a ridiculous idea up the
flag pole and it was STILL saluted by the PCers.....

So, if I understand you correctly, you are saying "Yes, a two year old
is a little young to be introduced to HIV and AIDs.  A Five year old
is better equipped to understand the concepts involved.."

Guess what??  I agree with you 1000% on this.  While I still maintain
that it shouldn't be introduced by way of a pre-school Public TV show,
I think you are correct.  If the afore is what you are saying..

Only up until the point that the parent feels the child can handle it.
I will not now, nor will I *EVER* subscribe to the idea that,
generally and overall, the government knows what is best for the
child, rather then the parent.  I seem to be somewhat alone in that
belief.. 

Now THERE's a novel concept, eh??  :^)

As I have stated before, there is no set age..

When the parent feels that the child is ready to handle such concepts.

Buying into Lena et al's concept, one would have to believe that
ANYTHING can be taught to ANY child, regardless of how young they are.

The PC crowd seems to think that you can teach a 2 yr old ANYTHING w/o
ANY psychological or physiological negative impact.  

I disagree with this.

There are somethings that simply MUST wait until the child is older.
It's THAT simple..

I guess I must not be as bad as some people think, because the idea of
that (Should 5 year olds watch hard core porn) never occurred to me..
:^)

Yes I moved the bar down to 2 yr olds..  However unintentional it was,
it was an error..

But it did have the effect of proving my point..

The PC crowd *followed* the low bar down there and STILL tried to
maintain a hold on their argument.

One has to wonder if the bar was moved down to one year olds, would
they STILL try to maintain their position is correct???

No, I don't see that either..

But I *DO* see the SA Government grasping at straws with the idea,
"Well, nothing else has worked.  Let's see if we can scare FUTURE
generations into abstinence..."

Wholeheartedly agree to the last point.

I simply maintain that there are MUCH better examples to teach
tolerance.

If we start singling out specific conditions that we must be
"tolerant" of, where should it end??

Cancer Muppet??
Heart Disease Muppet??
12-Toed Muppet??


etc etc etc ad nasuem...
