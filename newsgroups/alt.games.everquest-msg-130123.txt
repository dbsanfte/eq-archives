I find this EXTREMELY hard to believe. Something is seriously
wrong somewhere.

If you only parsed your log you are making a common error.
Your log does NOT show the true picture of all the damage done
in a fight. To get the picture you have to parse everyone's logs
that were involved in the fight.

Either that or the warrior and ranger you were grouped with had
seriously bad equipment, were slowed or were lagged.
