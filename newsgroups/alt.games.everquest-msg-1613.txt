The problem I have with guilds is they promote twinking and power
leveling.  I know everyone is going to say not my guild but most I have
seen even the real good ones do this in some way.  Im not saying its bad
it is just something I dont want to be a part of.  So I ask to you at
lvl 50+ when I want to go to the PoF and group how do I do it?  I either
hope my frends are on and group with them or I dont go.  So in other
words some zones are completely out of reach unless you have a guild.
Kind of dumb if ya ask me.
