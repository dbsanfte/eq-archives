I think the last lot of Group XP changes were good for the game I play - 
once again there were people in OT looking for groups, instead of slowly 
soloing mobs at the SF zone, all bunched together, but not talking.

Yep I agree, but even for someone like me, who enjoys grouping in the 
game, it's still hard work socialising with people, and working together 
as a team with people you don't know, and so I enjoy the higher group XP 
bonus as a reward.

Indeed, although our view of rogues in literature is mostly covered by 
the bard class, lots of skills, happy-go-lucky, bit grey at the edges, 
but can get themselves into and out of virtually any place or problem alone.

I'm not suggesting a nerf to soloing, I'm suggesting that if you want to 
solo you can, it's no harder than it ever was.  In PoP you'll get less 
XP than you used to, but there haven't been any announced changes to 
solo XP since that one.
