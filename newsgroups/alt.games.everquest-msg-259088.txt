No No the EQ way, we are talking about EQ!!!

Wait at the airport, where they carry platinum to the airplanes. 
You can do this without a tracker, look for the "Platinum Carrier"
walking between their spawn and the airplane.  The "Airport Security"
mobs are KoS to most everyone camping the "Platinum Carrier" mobs.

"Airport Security" mobs  drop the "Wand of Hot Lead" but they add a
lot and may not be worth the trouble. If you get a lot of them, you
may not make it to the zone.

Get in range, shoot at a PC with an arrow. They usually don't add.
When he aggros you you run up to him and melee him down with a long
sword.

Loot the drop.
