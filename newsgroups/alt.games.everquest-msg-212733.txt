That's why I said "predict."  Pre, meaning "before."

If you know the location, speed, and direction of every particle
in the universe, then you can predict exactly how those particles
will react with each other.  And therefore you can 100% accurately
predict the future, if it's all just particles.

But that's a big "if", and that's what I was getting at in my
original post.

Does your definition of knowing "everything" include the ability
to 100% accurately predict the future?
