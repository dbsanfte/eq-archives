I've seen this happen, when root wears off the script carries on as if
he hadn't been aggroed and it poofs because it's too close to the
despawn point.  I've also seen it work fine and the pig go down quite
happily at pretty much the same spot.

Never had any problems rooting it in the main area of the Pit.  Done
it a few times and never had a big boar aggro either, having said that
lost a good few piglets by not stopping him in time.

We tended to have someone rush off hugging the wall as soon as the
zonewide stampede emote goes off to root him out in the open.  However
this is because we liked to camp the far right corner (corner opposite
the zone out) of the pit rather than the far left (and slightly
inside) area where the script ends, if it gets around the corner into
the tunnel off the main area unrooted then static stuff tends to add
and you lose him.
