Actually I have tested this. My wife's wizard teleported someone to Iceclad.
We do not have Velious. After cast was complete, she got that LOADING,
PLEASE WAIT message. Next thing she was in the same zone as before BUT she
could not cast, could not camp, could not sit. All she could to was walk ...
so she waked to zone. After zoning everything was ok again.

I think there is a difference between "zoning" and "porting" into a zone ..
Another example comes to my mind. I was in Paineel with my newbie
necromancer and I went to visit Warens. I did not know at the time that I
needed to run the optional patch to get the zone. So I zone, EQ crashes. I
try to login again, crash again. At char selection the necro was in that
little room. I had to call Verant, the CS guy talked to a GM in game which
got me out of there.
