Best guess is that it was an accident.  The early EQ documentation stated
that Humans got a bonus to leveling, and didn't say anything about Halflings
having a bonus or penalty.  Note that Halflings and Humans are next to each
other in an alphabetical listing of races.  Porbably someone simply swapped
them in a table somewhere, so Halflings go the Human bonus, and Humans got
nothing.  By the time it was discovered, it was too late, so Halflings got
to keep the bonus.

Of course, since then, they've realized that they can effectively change XP
tables WITHOUT having to go back and change the XP value for every existing
character, by simply introducing XP modifiers (e.g., they did not actually
take the class penalties out, but rather gave the classes that had penalties
an XP bonus when they earn XP that is exactly enough to cancel out the class
penalty), so they could give Humans a bonus easily now (and fix the
Halflings...although my guess is that they would leave the Halfling bonus
in, the same way they left in the class bonus for Warrior and Rogue).
