1.  Go to the bazaar
2.  Buy a trader's satchel from merchant Tekrama
3.  Put your silks in the satchel
4.  Walk under a canopied section (where all the people
have "Trader" in front of their name
5.  Type /trader
6.  In the window that appears, click on one of the stacks of
spider silks.
7.  In the bottom left of the window is a Platinum slot, click it.
8.  In the pop-up window type the amount of PP you want to sell each
individual silk for (not the stack) I understand they go for as much
as 5pp (*)
9.  Click the "Set Price" button
10. Click the "Begin Trader" button in the lower right of the window.
11. Walk away and do house chores, go shopping, play with the dog etc.
12. Come back later and find out how much richer you are.

(*) To get a notion on what to price goods like this at type /bazaar,
in the top left box type the name of the item, the hit enter.  You should
see what everyone else is selling that item for.

Case in point - 
I spent a few hours today in Acrylia Caverns leveling my kitty and making
some cash - I walked away with 66 bricks of acrylia (various sizes.)  I 
returned to the bazaar, checked the going price on them.  If anyone is
selling only 1 or 2 I ignore that price (for tradeskill items, people will
pay a bit more to go to one place and get a bunch).  I found that the 
most common price for a Large Brick of Acrylia was 40pp.  I priced mine
at 35 (I'm going back tomorrow and want my bank clear).  I went and did
some laundry and a couple other chores and just checked back and I've made
1700pp.

I've looted 2 grimling skin masks there in the past few days - the going
price is 10-12k - I had to leave my trader up over night on the weekend
but I sold both for 10k each.  

There is no faster way to make cash than selling items to other players.

This doesn't cut into your play time, because you set up your trader when
your done playing for the day.
