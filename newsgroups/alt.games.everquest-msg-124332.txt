Yes, Monks will outdamage the same level anything with equal weapons
(toe2toe, melee)

They have seemingly changed this many times (again, anyone know better
please correct me, I'd love to know)

The Damage Tables are Now;
Std - Warrior, Hybrid, Rogue, Bard
High - Monk

I believe they used to be slightly different, something like
Levels 1-50
Std - Paladins, SK's, Bards
High - Warrior, Rogue, Ranger
Monk - Monk

51+
High table jumps to Monk level and Monk Table Jumps up again. Something
like;
High+ - All melee (inc Bard)
Monk+ - Monk

Confused? Me too. AFAIK I know there is only 2 tables and they both get a
boost at 51, Monk stays on top and the Knights moved up to match the
Warrior.

If it has changed since this OR I should be grasping the other end of the
stick, please tell.
No idea where Beastlord sits in this, Monk, Melee or Priest?
