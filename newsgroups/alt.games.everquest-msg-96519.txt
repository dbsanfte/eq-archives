First and foremost you should never ever group. It'll blow your cover.
You should solo as part of your disguise. You should be /role or /anon all
the time.
You should take a last name that sounds druidish too.
You should sit near zone edges and listen to people beg you for sow.
You should buy gobs and gobs of sow potions and drink them and then deny
that you can cast sow.

Now here's the kicker. You've got to wear metal armor. You see, druids
can't, so anyone that offers you money for a sow or port, while you're
wearing metal armor is just a goon. Take it though. Take it, spend it, and
drink heartily and often to keep AT up.

OK, before ppl flame me. I'm just kidding. It's true though, how many
halfling clerics out there in metal armor are asked for sow? I've got one
whose been cussed out in /ooc for not responding to a sow request, and I
wasn't /role or /anon and was wearing metal armor. Beggars are annoying. No
real reason to not capitalize on it is there? OK, maybe there is... Nope,
there's not.
