Don't know what level your current char is, so I can't say whether it would
be easier for you to build faction with the existing one or just start
again.  If you decide to start again, I can tell you that a human warrior
worshipping Rallos Zek can trade at least in Shadowhaven, and a human wizard
(probably the only human wizard my level on the server due to their
disadvantages) worshipping Rodcet Nife can trade in Shadowhaven, Sanctus
Saru, and Katta Castellum all by default.
