No, what is stupid is your class envy.  Camo wears off, randomly.
That level 5 druid was to watch for the camo icon to start flashing,
and then quickly find a place to recast the spell.  He's fully visible
while recasting.  All the rogue has to worry about is going LD or
zoning.  If you think the druid has it better, you are a far bigger
idiot than you think Verant is.

Rogues have the best invisibility in the game by a long shot.
