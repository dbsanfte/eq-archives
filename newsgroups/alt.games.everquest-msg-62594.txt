I've just been informed that after downloading the new patch, wife can
not log into EQ either. (And no, don't blame the new memory I put in
yesterday. It worked fine last night. <g>) She can get up to the log-in
screen, hit's enter, hears about ten notes of the music, then get's
booted to desktop.
Win 98SE, 384 MB RAM, 16 MB nVidia Graphics card, Still on DirectX 7.0
until we get new graphics card, P500 proc. Worked like a champ unti
lthis morning.
  Anyone else having problems of this nature?
