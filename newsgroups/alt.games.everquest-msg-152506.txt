Most parts of the world dialup is still metered per-minute.  Almost always
on the telco side, and sometimes on the ISP side as well.  (Amazing that in
about 2 years Japan has gone from one of the more expensive dialup-countries
to being the cheapest broadband access around - you can get 100mbit
bi-directional fibre to the home for under US$80/mo all-inclusive ISP and
telco combined)
