    A fair amount of info has come from Legends about the zone. It sounds
interesting. What's especially good is that it's almost all dry land, so no
underwater combat.

    This one honestly has me excited. Now my sales ENC can distribute items
without bugging anyone and without the people getting items having to leave
their XP spot. My twinks currently all end their day in The Bazaar, just in
case I need to pass items over, but not any more! And my sales ENC will be
stocking a lot more enchanted/imbued tradeskill items now. A great change.

    Naw. To be honest, BoT, HoH, and the tier II zones are pretty bad with
trains and foolishness as is. Open raids have seen to that. I can't see it
being much worse than it is now. And guildmembers will no longer bug people
to help them flag twinks. What I'm looking forward to is the reward. Right
now the item most players would like to see as a reward is a charm-slot
item, lore no drop, gained simply by hailing a quest NPC. It would give you
+1 all stats, +1 all saves, +1 AC, and +5 HP/MANA per flag you had that is
being opened up. So if you have PoV/PoS (that's one flag), PoTorment, CoD,
BoT, and HoH you'd have an AC 5 all stats 5 all saves 5 HP/MANA 25 charm
slot item. Excellent for a charm, especially considering what most folks
have in that slot now (nothing), but not a huge increase in character power
overall.

    If it's all items, my cash cow of scouring merchants and finding
tradeskill items sold to them will be removed!
