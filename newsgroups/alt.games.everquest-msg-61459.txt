Recommended RAM for Luclin is 512 MB.  256 MB is required, although
they say you'll be able to play with 128 MB if you turn off the new
models.

Hence, my questioning of that machine's "ultimate" status, since it
doesn't meet the recommended requirements.

It looked OK, depending on what parts are actually used ("motherboard"
doesn't exactly tell us much).

Let's try putting together a more "ultimate" EQ system, and see what
we come up with.  I'm going to just spec everything from
www.computerstop.com, since I don't feel like going around to a bunch
of web pages.  They generally are NOT the best prices, but
occasionally have good deals.

We'll compare to the advertised system of the original poster.

| Comes in Pentium 4 mid tower case

Let's take an Enlight ATX mid tower.  Reasonable case.
*** $60 (marking prices so I won't miss them when adding things up)

| Pentium 4 mainboard.
| Pentium 4 1.6ghz processor
| 256 mb ram upgrade able to 1ghz

Let's go with an Athlon.  A 1.3 GHz Athlon would be comparable with
that 1.6 GHz P4.  Computerstop has a nice bundle of an Asus A7M
motherboard, 1.3 GHz Athlon, CPU cooler, and 256 MB of DDR RAM.
*** $315

Throw in another 256 MB of DDR RAM to get ready for Luclin.
*** $55

| 32 mb agp Ge force II video card

Let's go with a 64 MB GeForce 2 MX400.
*** $100

| 52 x cdrom drive

OK.
*** $30

| on board sound

The A7M has onboard sound, too.

| speakers

Could be all over the map here.
*** $50

| keyboard and scroll mouse
*** $40

| loaded with your choice of windows 98 or XP
*** $130 (OEM XP Home)

A hard disk would be nice, too.  The A7M has ATA100, so let's go with
an IBM 7200 RPM ATA 100 40 gig drive.

*** $130

Maybe we should add a network card.
*** $20

I'm not bothering with a modem or a floppy.  Assumption is that the
ultimate EQ machine will have a cable or DSL connection, and the only
thing I use a floppy for nowadays is to boot to Linux and fix my MBR
whenever I reinstall Windows and it removes GRUB or Lilo for me.
Someone just running Windows doesn't need a floppy.

OK, so where did we come out on the first try?  We are at $990.  He
was at $797.  Without the extra RAM to meet Luclin specs, we'd be at
$935.  Not too bad for no shopping around at all.

While specing that, I also looked at their prebuilt systems.  They've
got some similar to his, for about the same price as his.

Conclusion: there is nothing really special about his machine, in
general, or in relation to EQ, and so his post was off-topic spam for
this group.
