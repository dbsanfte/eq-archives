Ah. So the real problem is either that (a) it's possible to aggro the boss
mob from a location he's really not supposed to be ever be in (and this
could be fixed by placing him in a different zone, for example), or (b)
that mob pathing doesn't work across the in-zone teleporters (and maybe
pathing could be fixed to take that into account).

So you might have a similar exploit type, say, pulling bard mail quest guy
in Erudin to Erudin docks, counting on him warping to docks to bypass
guards in between. Thanks for clearing that up. Never would have thought
to look at it in that light...
