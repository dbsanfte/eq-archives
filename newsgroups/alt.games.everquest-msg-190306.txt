    Sure... wizzy crits for 8k and I just cast one spell and... after he
dies... I have 100% chance of holding agro.

    I agree with the above statement 100%. However, it merely underlines my
point. There are *3* group main tank classes in the game, and none of them
are the best. They each have advantages and disadvantages. Why should one be
the best overall?

    Holding agro is a relative term. No tank is perfect at holding agro, no
tank can hold agro against a caster overdoing it, and pallies and sk's are
better at it than being a tank. Warriors are better at the other two out of
three abilities you outlined above.

    I'll almost never main tank for a raid group without one. Not that I
particularly want to do that - but my point was, if you give warriors my
taunting abilities, why not give me HIS big drawcard while you're at it. In
fact, why not just merge the 3 MT classes. The evil dual weilding
warrior-mage with fear, heals and /disc defensive!

    And the cleric.

    Warrior's can't solo worth a damn. (Basically) And by all accounts, they
never could. Knights can solo. They can even get decent exp out of it with
some ludicrous buffs and a shitload of practise, tactics, planning, luck,
balls, persistence and reflexes. Other classes could probably solo using a
macro. Soloing is not balanced. Neither, particularly, is soloing vs
grouping. Some examples of vague balance in this area could be pointed to,
as could others of glaring imbalance, as well as some vague imbalance. One
could say it's rather random, which makes me think SOE don't actually give a
rats ass about balancing solo vs grouping.

    If it was viable to do I would say that every class should be able to
solo almost as easily as every other class, but there's no way to do it
without totally screwing group dynamics. If warriors, pallies, and sk's
could solo as well as droods or bards no group would ever find a tank. Just
like you can't find a bard willing to group for love or money usually. (I
like fights that last 10 seconds or less)

    They are the best raiding tank, which is, according to most people who
are actually IN pop groups, sort of half the point of the game. The other
half is grouping, which you might say in most cases at that level has the
sole purpose of increasing one's ability to raid.

    SKs and pallies overall might be slightly better for exp groups than
warriors, as an MT. On the other hand, a group which already HAS a pally or
an SK, will choose a warrior over a 2nd knight every time. Warrior will
*eventually* taunt mob off knight, tank better and save mana, not to mention
add more damage.

    Being that I don't play a warrior, I don't know exactly how pitiful
their taunting is maybe it needs upping a little. However, 100% success is
ludicrous, and at no point will I accept the assertion that they need to
grab and hold agro better than or even as good as a knight. There is no
justification whatsoever for warriors to be a more desirable class in every
way than knights. None. They're still king shit on raids, still king shit in
most group situations. They come second, for the first time in history, to
another class, for *some* tanking groups. I say again..... build a bridge.
As a knight, I can't tell you how refreshing its been to hear that I'm
actually desired *over and above* another tank for some groups.

    Hally fucking looya frankly.

Cheers,
James
