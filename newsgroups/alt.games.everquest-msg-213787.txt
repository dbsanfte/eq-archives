    These players have higher resists, more HPs, and more mana pool by leaps
and bounds than the original level 60 explorers of NToV. If they could do
it, these folks can do it.

    Bwahahahahahahaha!

    The only real "required" stuff I can think of are the Waning Light
Katar, required level 55 (omg that's mid 50's!), and ornate armour, required
level 55 or have the appropriate flags from an open raid (omg that's mid
50's too!) The tradeskill idols, which have the focus level IV effects on
them, are required level 46, no recommended level. Oh, wait, one point for
you: the elemental bows are required 61. No ranger love. =/

    As for the "crap when equipped by low levels" nonsense: you do realize
how the stats are reduced, right? The formula is your stat = original stat x
(your level/recommended level). So that amazing 10 STA 90 HP elemental ring
is a "crap" 9 STA 81 HP ring on a level *54* (omg, that's mid 50's too)
character. Just putting Bloodmetal Earrings and Valorium Rings on all your
melees would be a whopping improvement over the Electrum Black Sapphire
Earrings and Velium Fire Wedding Rings the original explorers of NToV were
wearing. Not to mention all the stuff that isn't from PoP, like Earrings of
the Solstice, anything from Cazic Thule (required level 51, omg that's blah
blah), etc.

    Shawl of Perception, Mith Boots, Mith Gaunts, Mith Helm. Lady Mirenilla
is your Bazaar dragon.

    You're flip-flopping here. First you say that a group of mid-50's would
get crap stats out of PoP gear, then you state that the droppables from NToV
are crap compared with PoP gear for the same group. Which is it? Oh, and you
might want to look at those "crap" stats again.

    Again, we're not talking about stuff you would use. We're talking about
stuff a mid-50's group with good Bazaar purchasing power would use. And when
you relate it to them, there's a ton of stuff that they'd like. Not counting
Vyemm and Vulak, and including the droppables listed above, we have....

    Amulet of the Dreadgazer, Circlet of Summer, Hand of the Master, Mask of
Fall, Reaper's Ring, Ancient Wurm Hide Greaves, Belt of the Destroyer, Boots
of the Destroyer, Dagarn's Tail, Wurm Claw Pauldrons, Ancient Wyvern Hide
Leggings, Cloak of Venom, Crown of Resilliance, Sprinkler of the Spirits,
Orb of the Crimson Bull, Girdle of Dark Power, Nevederia's Left Eye,
Chestplate of Fiery Might, Staff of the SIlent Star, Blackstar, Wurmscale
Fistwraps, Barrier of Sound, Shadow Fang Necklace, whatever the hell the
warrior and monk flurry drake necklaces were called, Shield of Dragonkind,
Bracelet of the Sky, Cloak of the Sky, Fist of Lightning, Mask of the Sky,
Onyx Chain Sleeves, Ring of the Sky, Ancient Wyvern Hide Tunic, Silver
Chains, Ebony Headband, Cloak of Thorns, Mask of Terror, Boots of the Dead
Dream, Sky Watcher's Monocle, Ancient Pirate's Eyepatch, Bracelet of the
Deep Sea, Greaves of the Deep Sea, Net of the Deep Sea, Siren Song Dagger of
the Sea, Trident of the Deep Sea, Silver Disk, Verlekarnorm's Horn of
Disaster, Baton of Flame, Dragon Skin Bracelet, Tvenken's Slippers of
Silence, and the Windraider's Belt.

    I'll be the first to admit that the list above isn't as good as it seems
because the list of crud is just about as long. But that's enough good stuff
that our Bazaar twinks will get a good haul from clearing it all out.

    Our enchanter was 60 when we went. But the charm he used was the level
53 Boltran's, which our mid-50's group will have access to. I beleive the
bard level 39 charm song could also charm the level 46 'lings, but I don't
play a bard so I'm not certain of that (it's their only charm song until the
60's). And if you had a 59 ENC along with Dire Charm you could make
perma-pets of the 'lings, although I doubt a group of mid 50's will have
access to that.
