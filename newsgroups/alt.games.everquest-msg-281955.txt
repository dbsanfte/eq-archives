Sony didn't make raiding compulsory.  They added a lot of zones which were
locked unless you completed the raiding to get in.  They then relented not
long after and provided quest access and then Level access to some of those
zones.  Eventually, they relented even further and added complete flagging
processes for many of them (for example, access to Sol Ro is now a single
kill in Western Wastes, soloable by any kiting class post 55, and duoable
by anyone else).

There are a few ones in GoD you can get to unless you want to raid, and
with OoW / DoN / DoD there are even fewer restricted zones.

I didn't say casual friendly.  I said, other people complain it's too
casual friendly.  In essence, different people see the game as being
totally different.  I think you'll find however, that monster missions
particularly, and instanced missions in DoN as well, mean it's much easier
to get stuff to do as a casual player.

The game now is different to how it was just after OoW came out.

No longer true.  Monster missions can take 30 minutes and can yield good
xp, DoN missions can take 40 minutes and yield good XP.  DoD spell
progression missions can take longer, depending on the group setup.  There
are non-progression missions in DoD which I've not played with at all but
I'm confident are around the 90 minute duration mark.

They have changed it.  So much so that 'hardcore raiders' and many
non-hardcore raiders claim DoD has made the game so casual oriented, it's
dead.

I love how every different facet of EQ makes it dead to one or another
group of people.
