On Erollisi Marr, spider silks have averaged around that price as well.
There 
usually aren't a lot for sale, but most buyers eventually gravitate to
around 
that price range (8-12pp a silk). I just end up going on a massacre in
East 
Karana when I need silks... paying 8k for 800 silks to turn into
swatches is a 
bit excessive when I could simply farm then myself (and forage tea
leaves as 
well while I'm at it) in a few hours.
