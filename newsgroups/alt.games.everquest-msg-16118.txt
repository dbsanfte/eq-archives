Not it's not.  The higher you get, the more valuable you become.

My one caveat to this would be that half the players in the game who have hit
60 -- and seen how powerful high level rogues can be -- have twinked out a
rogue alt.  I don't know how many will really pursue the class past 50, but if
a lot of them do, rogues will get too common (and therefore harder to group).
