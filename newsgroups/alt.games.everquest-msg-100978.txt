I'm talking about improvement in the way the game is currently ran,
such as customer service and petitions taking up to 3 hours. I did not
explain that though.

I'd rather pay 6 or even 9 bucks more for that kind of improvement
than 3 bucks more for none. Or I'd rather just have verant say
SOMETHING is being improved in a fundamental way for that 3 extra
dollars. They could say ANYTHING, I mean give me a bone.
