  Fine, but where does that leave warriors and paladins, who are both
melee classes who are stuck without the benefit of being able get
bound anywhere, and are rather lacking tricks to make them survivable,
capable corpse retrievers?  If you argue melee classes shouldn't have
the "get bound anywhere capability" because they are better at CRs,
they ALL have to be better at CRs than ALL of the caster classes.

  And I don't really see how that is true.  Just look at the CR
capabilties of shadow knights and rangers vs. their parent classes.
They have the same advantages... in the case of rangers/druids, they
get SoW, snare, root, Camo... druids the spells earlier, or have
better versions of the spells... plus the ability to bind anywhere and
Gate.  The only thing rangers have going for them is the fact that
they have more HP (and they don't exactly have a TON of HP... without
their gear they're not going to fare much better when a couple blues
start being on them than a druid).  Pretty much the same deal for
shadow knights, except the CR skillset is different.

  So the way it seems to me is that some casters can CR good, some
can't.  Some melees can CR good, others can't.  So I'm not really
seeing a lot of reason to handicap all casters with the ability to
bind anywhere, while denying that skill to all melees.
