Poison vial sell prices were majorly nerfed in the last patch.
I'm working on sealed vials. They used to sell back for well over
a platinum, recouping a big chunk of the sketch cost. Now they 
sell for 4 SILVER. Damn.

At the same time I noticed water flasks got less expensive...
used to be 1 silver with maxed CHA, now 5 copper with low CHA.
More of the "make it easier for newbies" push I guess.
