LOL, although not having CS open on weekends sucks and is damned cheap of
them (they've ALWAYS been cheap in the CS area) I would disagree with the
term "hard handed." (actually I'd never heard that term before so I'm not
sure if I disagree with it or not <g> )

He was pissing and moaning, bitching and whining.  Whether or not he had a
reason to (and he did) it WAS a rant, NOT a question.
