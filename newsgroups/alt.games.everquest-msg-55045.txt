Ok, my apologies if this is already posted here today, but I looked and
couldn't see any message.

Verant made a mistake with the time for the /movelog command, it should have
started at 11am PST yesterday, not 8am PST as stated. So if you like me
posted your /movelog before that 11am time, you will need to do it again
today. Like many other people, I'll be more than a little annoyed if I am
not one of the "first come first serve" because of this mistake, and yes I
know I was not guaranteed to be in the first few before, but I did post my
/movelog yesterday just a little after 9am PST.

Oh well, I am at work for the next four and a half hours, so the next chance
I get for my /movelog will be at lunch time, I hope that gets me in the
"first come first serve" bracket. Good luck to all you other players who
need to post your /movelog's again.
