And I have never farmed anything for ebay nor bought anything from
ebay It just don't bother me if someone else does. If it bothers you
fine. 

So I am an idiot for not agreeing with you fine, lets go burn some
books while we're at it. No wait lets put spy ware on everyone's
machine to make sure they conform to your ideas and opinions. Oh sorry
I forgot in order to have an opinion I have to get it from you first.

You remind me of the little man in the Princess Bride during the
battle of wits. 

"The Sicilian smiled and stared at the wine goblets. "Now a great
fool," he 
began, "would place the wine in his own goblet, because he would know
that only 
another great fool would reach first for what he was given. I am
clearly not a 
great fool, so I will clearly not reach for your wine."
"That's your final choice?"
"No. Because you knew I was not a great fool, so you would know that I
would 
never fall for such a trick. You would count on it. So I will clearly
not reach 
for mine either."
"Keep going," said the man in black.
"I intend to." The Sicilian reflected a moment. "We have now decided
the 
poisoned cup is most likely in front of you. But the poison is powder
made from 
iocane and iocane comes only from Australia and Australia, as everyone
knows, is 
peopled with criminals and criminals are used to having people not
trust them, 
as I don't trust you, which means I can clearly not choose the wine in
front of 
you."
The man in black was starting to get nervous.
"But, again, you must have suspected I knew the origins of iocane, so
you would 
have known I knew about the criminals and criminal behavior, and
therefore I can 
clearly not choose the wine in front of me."
"Truly you have a dizzying intellect," whispered the man in black.
"You have beaten my Turk, which means you are exceptionally strong,
and 
exceptionally strong men are convinced that they are too powerful ever
to die, 
too powerful even for iocane poison, so you could have put it in your
cup, 
trusting on your strength to save you; thus I can clearly not choose
the wine in 
front of you."
The man in black was very nervous now.
"But you also bested my Spaniard, which means you must have studied,
because he 
studied many years for his excellence, and if you can study, you are
clearly 
more than simply strong; you are aware of how mortal we all are, and
you do not 
wish to die, so you would have kept the poison as far from yourself as
possible; 
therefore I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me."
"You're just trying to make me give something away with all this
chatter," said 
the man in black angrily. "Well it won't work. You'll learn nothing
from me, 
that I promise you."
"I have already learned everything from you," said the Sicilian. "I
know where 
the poison is."
"Only a genius could have deduced as much."
"How fortunate for me that I happen to be one," said the hunchback,
growing more 
and more amused now.
"You cannot frighten me," said the man in black, but there was fear
all through 
his voice.
"Shall we drink then?"
"Pick, choose, quit dragging it out, you don't know, you couldn't
know."
The Sicilian only smiled at the outburst. Then a strange look crossed
his 
features and he pointed off behind the man in black. "What in the
world can that 
be?" he asked.
The man in black turned around and looked. "I don't see anything."
"Oh, well, I could have sworn I saw something, no matter." The
Sicilian began to 
laugh.
"I don't understand what's so funny," said the man in black.
"Tell you in a minute," said the hunchback. "But first let's drink."
And he picked up his own wine goblet.
The man in black picked up the one in front of him.
They drank.
"You guessed wrong," said the man in black.
"You only think I guessed wrong," said the Sicilian, his laughter
ringing 
louder. "That's what's so funny. I switched glasses when your back was
turned."
There was nothing for the man in black to say.
"Fool!" cried the hunchback. "You fell victim to one of the classic
blunders. 
The most famous is 'Never get involved in a land war in Asia,' but
only slightly 
less well known is this: 'Never go in against a Sicilian when death is
on the 
line.'"
He was quite cheery until the iocane powder took effect."
