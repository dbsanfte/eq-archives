From the shadows, the mysterious "Catastrophe"
<Catastrophe@DIEEVILSPAMthewolfbite.co.uk> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>Ok so you seem pretty bored of the Cleric class right ?
>
>Your bored of buffing, then sitting down and watching the action from afar
>until you throw in a well timed heal and sit back down ?
>
>You enjoyed questing armour ?
>
>Then my suggestion is ... Create a New toon.

This was going to be my suggestion as well. It should have been
obvious.

I've hit walls too. I get out of it by going and playing something
else. I'm not being relied on by anyone at the moment by my own
choice, even though it does keep me out of the highest level zones. I
can live with that for now, because right now its about having fun,
not 'being responsible' to guild.

It also helps that I've managed to get into the groove of alt tabbing
my enchanter's way through charm "soloing" (it's tough to call it
soloing when the druid on backup is actually doing most the work). I
had hit a wall, just like you, about a year ago with the enchanter and
she had stopped leveling at 36. I left her and made my ranger (who
since became my second highest character). Later on after a couple
retirements I left the ranger and tried out the Test server. And then
just recently after getting irritated at it I went back to her to give
charm soloing a try, something I had never done before. Works great!
Started having tons of fun, especially since there is no downtime in
charm soloing and it's somewhat tense. Then I got the druid (inactive
for many months) going on backup, and exp is even faster (I got L45 in
a single extended potg tonight) and its marginally safer, but still
rather risky (haven't died with druid on backup yet, but got the snot
kicked out of me a few times). I don't even bother getting a KEI.

So now the enchanter is where I'm getting my EQ fun.

Try a twink out. Or even just a new character untwinked.
