It is _not_ anybody else's fault but your own when you fail to
account for your lo STR in your choice of equipment.  I managed
just fine with an 80 base STR on a half-elf Paladin, unable to
wear small armor and playing at a time when most any affordable
Paladin usable weapon that did squat for damage weighed a ton,
you know, the good old days when a BIBS (not a BABS) was worth
1000pp and a Shiny Brass Halberd (16/48 and wt. 15.0) was considered
an okay 2hs for mid to late teens.  I remember greedy loot whores
who would get themselves way overweight, trashing their AC and
damage output and changing a close encounter into a TPW.

It's your character, and it's up to you to play him/her intelligently.
Blaming somebody else for failing to overcome your shortcomings is
pretty damned lame.
