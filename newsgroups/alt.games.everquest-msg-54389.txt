At your level you should be fighting with dots and thorns (=working on
defense), so Ulthork without question. I like the ac7 vox bracers, and the
metal look is nice )
When you get to your mid 30's where meleeing gets too hard and you either
quad or root kite, toss them both out and get some pbb, cbb or rmb's. If you
root kite, mana wont be an issue, so save up some money for some ES
vambraces (free drones of doom)
