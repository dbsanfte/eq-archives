I'll cast whateve spell I want on whoever I want, thanks for your concern.

Alchemy is not a way to make money. If that is your idea, just stop now,
because it will never happen.

Try getting your skill above just the trivial level. Just because it is
"trivial" doesn't mean it has become easy.

Plus, to be honest, if you are still at the stage where you fail 30-40% of
your SoW potion attempts, you haven't spent jack shit on raising alchemy.
Try dropping nearly 22,000 platinum into it like I have (and I'm still not
maxxed out), before you come bitching about costs.

Why should they? Someone else is willing to do it for free. They are under
no obligation to support you.

Perhaps you just have terrible mercantile skills. Selling in Firiona is a
good sign of that...far too busy a transit point for people to not have SoW
available. Go inside KC, or to trakanon, or lower guk...
