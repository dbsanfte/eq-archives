All level 35 or so...
They are not the guards, but rather the lesbian looking
sensible shoe'd girls who are often near them. If they are a female,
not a vendor, they are fair game. Only one male is on kaladim citizen
faction, they yellow bearded guy (with old models) in a hut near a
kaladim citizen female by the dock. All the other males which are
similar (level 35, same hp, etc) are on dwarf "goody" factions which
lower stormguard (dwarf warrior guild, guards)  and paladin/cleric
factions I think. 

A druid can do them fine solo starting at 35. My cleric with jboots
was soloing one at 39, but soloing is not that efficent for her of
course. It was still fun though. After messing around with stun and
her snare thing, which wasted time and mana, finally she just ran and
stopped every so often and nuked once (wrath) This worked the best.

Their locations are:

Total of two on the docks (one per dock)
One female and one male in stone huts back behind the dock (still in
dock area)
Out of the dock area and past the guards are two by some ruins.. off
to the left.

3 are along the shore, past the new goblin camps (which you can see
from shore near the docks). One is a fast spawn (den?) of 6 minutes or
less or something, so it is often camped. 
The other two  inside the stone huts there are longer spawns like near
12 minute I think. 

Continuing on behind them and past the druid ring merchant, you
eventually are near signus in a lil stone hut alone (12 minute or so)
Way over by the chessboard, is another single signus spawn, making
these two easy to confuse.

on the way to the crossoads, from the dock or kaladim, you come to
another single 6 minute fast spawn (delin?) out by an anvil and a
dwarf guard. Don't worry, never had the dwarf guards assist these.

The two "forgotten" ones are just in front of kaladim, in a stone hut
where merchants are. I guess they are never done since you'd need
harmony or FD to seperate them. My druid did them for a long time
starting at 35 or so, they were great once split. They spawn every 12
minutes so if you are lower level once split you can arrange it to
have a new dwarf about every 6 minutes which makes this camp as good
as camping a 6 minute single spawn like delin.

Kaladim citizen is ONLY these dwarves I've mentioned, so no one else
hates you for killing them.

If you don't care about real kaladim factions, you could also kill the
regular males such as the two by the dock shore, the one fishing along
the shore by den and friends, etc. They lower good dwarf real
factions.

As far as guards you really can't kill any. They resist very well and
have loads of HP. They are not worth killing at all. There are two
though who I guess are sort of non real guards, they are pretty low
level.. like blue to a 35 or less, and are out by some tower with a
high elf vendor.. I think back behind those new goblin camps. They
have weird factions, like they are on the rogue guild faction of those
rogues near the bank in kaladim. They don't lower any "good" factions.

I really liked the kaladim citizen lady killing because your dwarf
factions and merchant factions were untouched. This meant you could
kill them right in front of kaladim then immediately sell their fine
steel and other weapons to the vendor standing right there. So this
spawn was a lazy way for me to make lots o' cash. This was also back
before the cash nerf, so their axes sold for about 22 plat every time
(they ALWAYS drop at least one of that axe) Since the cash nerf, they
are only 4 plat or something =(  Before the nerf it was possible to
earn several thousand plat, just working on xp on those dwarves.
Now I guess you'd still do okay, but figure about 1/4 or 1/5 of the
money you'd make back then. The bloods have a use though now, for ogre
cultural smithing, so I guess you could sell them in the bazaar or
something.
