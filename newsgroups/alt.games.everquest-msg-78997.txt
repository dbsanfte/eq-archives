Sheesh, I was in a group the other day in DL. This Druid that grouped with
us kept INSISTING that he get a share of the gem drops that were being
looted - even though the coin was being auto split.

I tried to explain to him that it was completely unfair, not to mention bad
form, for a druid to try and claim a share of looted gems when they can so
easily make money porting people around. I don't know how many auctions I
see every night in DL for ports, sometimes as much as 100pp for crying out
loud.

I can't believe these greedy druids sometimes. They can make 100pp in 15 min
doing nothing but casting a single spell and they still expect a share of
the loot. Its just amazing!
