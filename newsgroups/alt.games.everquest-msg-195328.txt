How many more nukes could you possibly cast on one mob during the time it 
takes to kill it? KEI is great, but I wouldn't think it would allow for 
more than say one more nuke - two at the very most. Maybe I don't realize 
how long it takes to kill these mobs in question.

I do recognize the fact that it increases the amount you can accomplish. 
I just don't think people should lean on it or consider it a necessity 
the way they do.

I'm sure there is a difference. It may have much to do with perception 
where how much is concerned.
