Yeah, it would.  But it has a couple of problems.

Anything that they put into the game that allows people to automatically say
or do things will be used by some social misfit to disrupt the game.

It could also be used to automatically bot your character, which means it'll
never get added.

For example, set a trigger for 
* hits you for *

then make the response be something like:
/target %1
/attack

and park it on a mob spawn that you can easily kill and gives you a faction
that you want.

I used to play on a MUD, and I had a whole set of tintin macros for my
character.  I could set him up as an enchant bot, people could hand him
weapons, he'd enchant them, and hand them back, all automatically.  Did a
lot of other things, too.

Had another set that I'd use whenever my alignment started getting too good
(I stayed on the evil side of neutral).  I'd park him in the rice paddies,
and move back and forth between rooms every minute.  When a peasant showed
up, I'd automatically kill him.  No exp, but it'd lower my alignment.  After
15 or 20 minutes, I'd be back to the alignment I wanted.
