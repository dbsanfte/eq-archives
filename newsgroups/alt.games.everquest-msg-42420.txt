You would be better off with a pair of +hp rings at low levels.

1hs - Crystal Fiber - 100pp.
1hb - Enamelled Black Mace - 100pp
pierce - Bloodstained Fang - 25-50pp.

Full banded armor - 80pp (Possibly add a cloak of the ice brear (50-75pp))

Velium Fire Wedding Ring (+6 ac +65 hp) x 2 - 1200 pp
or cheaper
Platinum Fire Wedding Ring (+5 ac +55 hp) x 2 - 600pp
