Not really.   What he is defining "breaking mez" as is not just a single hit
to release the mob(which seems to be your definition), but releasing the mob
and say 5 to 10 seconds afterwards to gain aggro if taunt failed.

Again, I agree somewhat with him, but he's making a lot of generalizations
about the warrior's gear, based on a single item, thier haste.  Like most
generalizations, they're sometimes right, but fail with good regularity.  In
my raiding career, I've seen several warriors with FBSS level haste items,
who had thier epic or other similarly good weapons.  I've also seen (and for
a while I was one) warriors who had decent haste items that couldn't get a
good aggro weapon to save thier life.  One does not mean the other, it just
implies it a bit.    It all depends on how the rolls / dkp / whatever works
out.
