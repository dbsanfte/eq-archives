Really?  You must have some private personal meaning you attach
to the phrase "selective hearing" unknown to the rest of the
world then.

I have indeed heard about a few improvements, none of them were
described in especially glowing terms (look back at what I wrote).

Look back at what I wrote.

*shrug*
I see EQ and DAOC raved about in forums not dedicated specificly
to them.  I have seen nothing like that for UO.  And the handful
of folk I've known in RL who played UO got excited about EQ, or
DAOC, or even NWN, in ways that they never did about UO.
