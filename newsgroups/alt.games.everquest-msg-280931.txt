	Every time I hear about the looting in New Orleans all
I can think of is six people standing around a dead WalMart:

	"What dropped?  What dropped?"
	"Color TV."
	"Nuts, I was hoping for some Breakfast Bars..."
	"Those are a rare drop.  I've killed like 8 WalMarts
	and all I ever get is Color TV's."
