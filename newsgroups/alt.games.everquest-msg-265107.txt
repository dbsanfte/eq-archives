To be honest, I'm quite annoyed by it. I love EQ, and what I've read
so far about EQ2, I really don't like. However, the large majority
here seems very interested, so I don't complain much, but if people
could use [EQ2] and [CoH] and [OT] in their subjects a bit more
liberally it would be great. This is also important down the line,
because just the other day I was looking for some info, and googling
around I found a few interesting posts, and every once in a while I'd
read halfway through a post and suddenly realize they are talking
about EQ2. That's kinda annoying, but worse, will completely confuse
people looking for information here and in a sense make it
significantly more difficult to find information on what you're
looking for. It's like we're loosing the wealth of information that
has accumulated here due to it being dilluted with other game data
that is not entirely unrelated, but has nothing to do with EQ per se.

By the way, at first I didn't mind, and was even interested in the
occasional thread, but if you look over the subjects of the currently
active threads, it's safe to say that 2/3 to 3/4 are EQ2, CoH and OT.
That's kinda sad, and I've stopped reading the NG as regularly as
before, because honestly, I read it for info about EQ, and don't like
sifting through 100s of posts to find the 5 i want to read.
