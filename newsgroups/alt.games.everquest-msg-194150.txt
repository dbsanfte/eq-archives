6 levels.  For that Matter, the best Beastlord slow is 65%, only 10% less 
than a shamans best slow.  Of course, the BL has to wait til level 65 for 
that one, 14 levels after shaman get their best slow.  So, Zarris, what 
kind of a slow do you think a Druid would need that would be better than an 
Enchanter, but not as good as a shaman?
