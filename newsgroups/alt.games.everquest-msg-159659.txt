        These do not seem to be fixed.  Had a 3 grp raid in PoD killing
stuff that had dropped a few parhments before patch. After 5 hrs of pulling
many mobs , not  1 parchment. Heard the same from other grps / raids hunting
in PoD , PoN & PoJ.  Would be nice if Sony decided to finally finish
itemizing PoP.  Really getting tired of software (game) companies shipping
unfunished products.
