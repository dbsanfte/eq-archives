I specialized alteration too (druid), so that doesn't mean anything.  Even
though clerics get a lame assed 15% healing bonus compared to everybody else
(caster balance please to be fixing this /nod), at that level you don't
*need* clerics because you don't *need* CH.

I call myself a healer, but that's mostly just because people die unless I
cast those silly useless heal spells on them.

Though I'd really just rather over nuke, get summoned and beat into a
leather, chain and plate encrusted bloody pulp. (/sarcasm off; I rarely nuke
except for killshots and soloing)

Which is basically what I said =D

Yeah, if you open with charm on a Scorp, then send it in to attack Scorp_02,
they'll trade HTs.
