It wasn't "the" quest - I was looking for a group for any of
three different quests during the couple hours I was logged on.

Also, as a lvl 22 templar, the bulk of the quests in my Journal
require a group.

My time constraints are such that I can play an hour here
and an hour there. Translation - I'm not in a situation where I
can have a regular group to play with and I rely on pickup groups.

I guess your point was that I should continue to run from zone to
zone to zone LFG in an attempt to "move on to other content"
during the short periods I have to play?

Also, please explain to me how playing WoW means you are
"pussy (ing) out", as you so eloquently put it.
