I've been in it since beta 1, but don't ask anyone in here for help.
Most in here see it as a threat to PCEQ.
All I can say is when you get your Beta 3 CD, just follow the quests.
EQOA has a quest for you at almost every level. Some will get you up
to 5 lvls if you do it right. 
In beta 2 I got my rogue to lvl 24 on quests alone.
The thing i like is NO TWINKS, twinks being characters of low level
using high level gear. IN EQOA your gear is level specific so you
can't give a lvl 5 player a lvl 40 sword, but you do have to get your
gear repaired as it gets beat up with use. 
Just enjoy the game it's fun for the casual player as well as the
hardcore.
The Zones are huge in EQOA,and there are way more areas than in EQPC.
It took me 3 hours to run from Qeynos to Freeport, stoppong only at
the coachmen to log myself at the stables so it took me like 2min to
get back to qeynos using the horses.
Personally as a PCEQ player i love the fact that it takes place 500
yrs before PCEQ. I love running through a zone that I'm so familiar
with and seeing the change.
Like the towers in North RO and the ruins in north Karana in PCEQ are
now the city of Forkwatch.
Just Play and have fun.
