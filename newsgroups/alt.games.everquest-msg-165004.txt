Why shouldn't you?

If you want something BAD ENOUGH you put in the time and effort.  Theres
something I REALLY needed.. as a result I camped it Friday night with
friends till > 8am saturday morning.  Granted that was a very extreme
example, but if thats what it requires.. well either put up or shut up.

Then Im THRILLED you didn't get it.  I hope some lil mage or rogue etc
stumbles across him 10 mins after you logged and gets the best loot in his
career.  That is > your money making scheme.

Prove it?  And even if they did.. thats the way the game is.  Every ph you
kill has a chance at popping the named.. it doesn't mean it WILL though, or
that each ph killed is 1 less ph till the named pop.
