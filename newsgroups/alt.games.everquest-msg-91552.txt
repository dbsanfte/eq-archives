     It seemed that way to me too, Todd, when I 
first started posting about a year ago.  And I
guess I can say that it still does, to some extent.
There is no doubt that there are some strong 
personalities in the group, and they don't mind
a bit clashing with others.
   The best thing for me was to learn to be 
selective in reading here.  Sometimes a tread
will start out on-topic and informative, stay
that way for eight or a dozen posts, then 
degenerate into flames.  It happens fairly often, 
and its easy to spot when it does.  At the point,
just mark the tread as being over, and move on
to another topic.  The nice thing about this
group is that it gets enough traffic that there
are always on-topic, interesting, no flame wars
yet threads going on.  Some threads you can mark
as read without even looking at.  Pretty much
anything with "Bizbee" in the subject, for 
example. 
    But I think that you will find that the 
longer you stay here, the more you being to
understand and appreciate why the more
abrasive regulars react the way they do.
If you do stay, you might find yourself 
thinking one day, after reading moronic
Anti EQ Troll #76,958, "Wow, what a tool.
I hope XXXXX lays into them until they 
just go away."  And the nice thing is that
will probably happen.
