No shit, but you're still stuck with getting the trojan off your system.

I just ran into a trojan that attack's Zone Alarm somehow. I think this
is a brand new one, because the latest Norton's virus sig update can't
remove it; can't even detect it.

The only way I spotted it was that at the end of an install, Zone Alarm
popped a message asking if I wanted to permit Litmus.exe to access the
internet as a server.

Zone Alarm don't have a button for "Not just no, but HELL NO!!!"

And the damn thing is persistant, changing it's name every time you tell
Zone Alarm not to allow it to have access.

And somehow it garbages Zone Alarm at startup if you reboot. Just go
ahead and let your system connect to the internet before Zone Alarm
starts!

Beware of a new mozilla based browser called Beonex.
