The marshmallows are inhaled so quickly that any fur in the area is
blown away by the resulting wind.

>The empty calories can make them fat! 

They don't want apples, though. I feed those to the opossum. And other
leftovers (like doggie-bags from restaurants) go to whoever gets there
first.

They get plenty of birdseed, too. They bang my bird feeder against the
tree each night to dump all the seed onto the ground. I've had to
rebuild that feeder several times now. It's sort of a contest -
currently I'm winning but I don't expect my lead to last much longer.

Like climb out on a branch ten feet above the ground and free fall
from there onto my suet feeder, then hang upside down eating all my
suet? That kind of crazy?

"Helpless" and "raccoon" don't really go together, from what I've
seen. Hell, I've seen the knots they can tie - they're amazing.

>Annie <--- A cat person, but NEVER feeds them marshmallows.

My cats fed themselves anything that was not hermetically sealed away.
Including pies and cakes, cereal, twinkies, and anything else they
could find. That was another contest that I generally lost.
