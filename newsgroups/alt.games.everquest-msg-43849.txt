THAT IS EXACTLY THE SITUATION THAT TCC WAS DESIGNED TO AVOID.

Why take a group to Kaesora, which requires a certain degree of skill
and coordination and planning, when you can just mindlessly level and
then mindlessly camp green mobs? 

It's just a pity that, as I predicted, Verant didn't have the sense to
ignore the whiners and make a change that was good for the game.

Ah well, DAoC is out soon. From what I hear, the developer's there have
a healthy contempt for their customers, so the game should be worth
playing for a while, until the whiners ruin it.
