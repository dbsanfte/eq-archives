Don't you LOVE that?  :)  I always, always look at vendors... you never know
what you'll find on them!
I've bought dark mail gaunts and other items, and even seen a shield of the
slain unicorn (expensive, but still cheaper than i've seen it player
sold)...

I worked up that skill long before I hit 30, because I knew that would
happen...
(endure cold... the only spell you get for that skill beforehand)
If you've never had feign death before playing this game (I hadn't) then you
will
BOW DOWN AND WORSHIP IT!   This spell has saved me countless, countless
times from certain death.  True, it doesn't always work, but it's still
darned good.
And if you make a pull that gets messy or need to break a big pull... voila.
And gather shadows...  nuff said.
