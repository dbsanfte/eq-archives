Often this is caused by some other program in memory interfering
with EQ.  My nephew, for example, had behavior similar to this after
he installed a new MP3 player that was "always active".  A little
*too* active...

Think about what you may have installed between the time EQ worked
for you and the time it didn't.  That may be the culprit.

Also, try shutting off absolutely *everything* on your system
except EQ, then fire up EQ.  Kill everything you see under the
Task Manager except for "Explorer" (which is the Windows
user interface) if you're on a pre-XP/2000 Windows system.

If you're on Windows XP/2000, it gets a little trickier.
Go here:

(Actually, the same utility works on Win 98/etc. as well,
and is handy to have.)

Download the utility, and run it.  This nifty utility will
show you a list of all the programs that Windows is set to
launch automatically on startup.  Lot of stuff, eh?  Look
for anything unnecessary, odd, or related to things that you've
installed recently, around the time your problem started.
Try killing the useless stuff in Task Manager (look on both
the "Applications" and "Processes" tab for them).  If nuking
something then starting EQ allows EQ to run properly, then
remove that item from Windows' autostart entirely, so it
won't bother you again, unless it's something you really,
really need -- and most of that stuff isn't.  If on the other
hand nuking the item crashes Windows, then try removing it
from the startup list and then rebooting, etc.

General note:  The same website has a *ton* of incredibly
useful Windows utilities that are unique and indispensable.
The authors there deserve to be knighted.
