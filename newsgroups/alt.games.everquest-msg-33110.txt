Starting out as a Ranger I concentrated on strength so that I could carry
more than just the armor I'm wearing and the weapon's I'm using.

In the upper levels the primary stat that you should concentrate on is AC.
Rangers really get beaten on by the higher mobs.  All things being equal I
would look at STR next followed by either DEX, AGI or STA.  WIS is nice for
Rangers but we usually have enough mana to do what we need to do (Snare,
DOT, Nuke, emergency heals).  Which leaves INT and CHA which are not
important for Rangers (I have some CHA gear to get better prices but it's
not necessary).

The equipment you have is good for the level you're at.  It took me a while
before I got the next level of armor (Ivy Etched).  From there I got Ry'Gorr
armor from Velious and from there Plane's Armor (Thorny Vine), Sebilis Armor
or Velious Quest Armor (Runed Scout's) and the occasional bought or obtained
specialty item.
