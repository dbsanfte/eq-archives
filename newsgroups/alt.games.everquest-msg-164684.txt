Went and tried this with my 42 bard.

Did 4 runs; first time thru took roughly 40 minutes since I wasn't sure where
the vendors in question were located... I particularly missed the freeport
vendor, wandering deep into WFP thinking she was at the Arcane... a false
memory, she's right inside the gate.  I also missed my turn in FV and zoned out
to DL!

At any rate, I ran it a second time in 23 minutes, then did a double run,
starting in Freeport, running the quest, doing the combine in FV, then picking
up the FV item (have to try to buy it twice as suggested on Allakhazam)  and
going backwards, this way when I handed in the combined box, I just asked for
another, combined the items in that, and handed it over again.  Elapsed time 40
minutes for the double run.

At level 42 I was getting 4% per handin, so perhaps its already been nerfed
down a bit.  Profit per run around 30pp, or 60pp for the double run, you do
need to have about 30pp to invest to start with.

Frankly, I make exp faster than this soloing at the orc fort... but thats not
an endeavor free of risk, and this is very close to safe.

I was using selos in all outdoors situations, and clicking on TBoots just
before zoning in to Thurgadin, and going to DE form on entering so I didn't
have to duck thru the gates.  I also had to use Carrilion on the Thurg vendor.

Any caster could cut some time off by binding in PoK and gating back after each
pickup.  A druid or wizard could do even better by binding in FV and using PoK
port.  I'd guess the fastest way of all to do it would be with a wizard/bard
team, bind both in FV, have the wizard use TL to bind to get the bard there,
and port back up from the further runs (Bazaar, Thurgadin), and use bard selo
for all the runs from book to vendor.
