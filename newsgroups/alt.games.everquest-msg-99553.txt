If I'm paying for a port, they better deliver, personal bitch
or not.   You do realize the port was against the PnP, for
instance?  But remember that the next time you pay for
a 90% rez and someone give you a Revive instead.  I'm
sure you won't bitch, right?

And if the druid can't provide the service, they shouldn't
take the money but get out and hunt instead of being a
port whore.

As long as they know the zone, one of the ogres doesn't spawn,
and the orc runner doesn't come through the zone, yeah.  Which
has exactly *nothing* to do with "/ooc donating for a port to GFay"
and ending up in BB because some druid was such a port whore
they had to fake the service requested for a few plat.
