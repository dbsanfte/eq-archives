Au contraire. They are the people most likely to see the trees and not 
just the forest. Anyone can say: "Hey the forest needs a little thinning 
for its own good". And it sounds really smart and reasonable at that level.

But to actually implement this, someone has to go into the forest, and 
start pointing at individual trees for the axe.

Now if humanity is the forest, and humans are the trees... some of those 
trees are my family and friends, and some of those trees are your family 
and friends, and one of those trees is you... now do you still really 
want someone wandering around with an axe in there?

You have to ensure that you understand it, and are comfortable with it 
on a 'personal level', because every single tree that gets picked is 
somebodies close relative. Sooner or later it will hit close to your 
heart too.
