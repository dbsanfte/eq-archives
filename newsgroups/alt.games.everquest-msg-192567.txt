Rumble;

Sorry to disappoint you but this is not a "gimme".  I started EQ in January.
I've played a shammy to 15 and a necro to 9 and now this character to 37 (as
of Sat nite.)

Are you always this negative to people?  I feel sorry for you.

Doctorzoid
37 Cleric (The hard way)

To all others that took the time to answer..Thank You, your answers are a
great help.
