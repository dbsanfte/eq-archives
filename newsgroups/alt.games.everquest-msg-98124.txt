Well, *now* I feel better. :-)))
We had only one person there who had done VSR before. And the eleven of
us still got him, though it was close. We've had a discussion going on
in the officer's forums about how to refine the strategy so I can do it
with less next time if needed, though I'd still rather have two full
groups if available.

But to the original question, for good old VS himself (who apparently
can drop the grieves for many classes of the Kunark armor, including
cobalt) I'm wondering how many I need for a first go, what changes to
strategy are required, etc. to avoid a TPW.
