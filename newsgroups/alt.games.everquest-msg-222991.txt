I admit that I don't follow much of EU politics... I usually only
watch the movements in Belgium, since the rest are insignificant.

Oh, your ignorance is much more universal.

There ARE no safe places. That's an ignorant statement. And if and
when something bad happens to you, I pray you don't have any
dependents along with you to be hurt as well.

Really? Where do you live by the way? What's the name of this
crime-free Utopia?

Delusion? Cute. Unfortunately the primary delusion you harbor is that
you're safe.

Yeah, but most Europeans went whining to the US and Russia the last
time the Shit hit the Fan. And we've been providing them their
protection ever since. I personally would like to see that stopped.
Ingrates shouldn't be pandered to.

You asked a question, I answered.

Not at all. I never stated anything of the sort.

You already HAVE them. And you're too pig-ignorant to address that
fact. Every time you get into a scrape, you come whining to the Big
Bad Scary Place with a lot of guns to save your ass. Then you turn up
your effette noses to us after the dirty work is done. Truly sad.
Maybe next time we won't be there to pull your fat out of the fire.

Cool... Send me some of them. My Collection isn't complete.
