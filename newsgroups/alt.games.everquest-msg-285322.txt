Ok will post them as replies, remember each was written before the armour
in the one after it was available (OoW first, then PoR, then TSS)
-------------------------------------

Unless you raid, the choices for visible armour pieces on warriors at level
70 revolves around DoN Tradeskill Armour, DoN Crystal Bought Armour or
Omens of War Tier 1 Quested Armour.

The chest and leg drops for the OoW armour are not trivial to obtain, but
in some cases can be 1-grouped. All of the no-drop parts of the OoW armour
are rare, the chest and leg drops doubly so. However, they are included
here for completion.

The main focus for warriors when selecting armour are HP and AC. Additional
benefits include STA, Endurance, AGI, DEX and then other modifiers such as
shielding, accuracy, hp regen, attack etc. This article focuses on the key
elements of HP and AC. In the case of the Cultural armour, only the
Grandmaster armour is considered and it is considered with the inclusion of
a suitable Grandmaster augmentation (since without them the stats are
sub-par).

I'll use the Dwarven DoN Cultural Armour (Stormguard) but it is my
understanding that the key stats across all the GM Warrior Plate armour are
the same.

Set 1 - DoN Crystal Bought - xxxxx of the First Order (this is from the
'good' camp, the 'evil' camp has an equivalent armour set with a different
name).
Set 2 - DoN Cultural - Grandmaster's Stormguard xxxxxxx
Set 3 - Omens of War Tier 1 Plate - Armsmaster's xxxxxxx

Each of the three armour sets provides a good set of armour class and
hitpoints. There is no one particular set which provides the best hp and ac
in every slot, to get that you'll need to mix and match.

Here are the totals,

Code:
                            AC     HP      Minimum Required Level
First Order                 347    910     70
Grandmaster's Stormguard    452    1040    65
Armsmaster's                395    975     60


It's clear from that list that if you wanted to only focus on one set, you
should get a full set of the DoN Cultural armour. It has a significant AC
benefit over the other two sets, and a useful HP lead. Additionally, you
can't even wear the First Order armour until you reach level 70, where-as
the other two sets can be worn earlier, although whether you could tank the
mobs which drop the items for the Armsmaster's armour is a different
question. If you are already level 70, then the required level is of no
issue, but if you're still below level 70 and you're working your way
towards one of these armour sets, bear that required level in mind.

Is it worth mixing and matching the sets however?

Code:
              Slot               chest legs wrist head hands feet arms
Armour set
First Order                ac    72    51   32    41   39    39   41
                           hp    125   125  115   110  105   110  105

Grandmaster's Stormguard   ac    99    81   32    59   45    45   59
                           hp    145   145  115   135  135   115  135

Armsmaster's               ac    78    57   38    47   45    45   47
                           hp    140   130  115   120  120   115  120


In most cases, the DoN Cultural armour is best of breed in each slot,
however the wrists are noticeably week compared to the Armsmaster armour.
Also, in terms of AC and HP, there's no discernable difference GM and
Armsmaster in the feet slot, and only a small HP difference on the hand
slot. One thing is clear, in every case for Warriors at least, the generic
First Order armour is the weakest choice you can make. However, it does
have one potential saving grace - type 9 slots. There are a range of
augmentations available from DoN which fit into type 9 slots and bring with
them more resists, more hitpoints and in some cases, additional stats such
as attack and accuracy.

For example,

Sparkling Ametrine Gemstone
MAGIC ITEM NO TRADE AUGMENTATION
Augmentation Type: 9, 12
WT: 0.0 Size: TINY
STR: +5 DEX: +5 STA: +5 CHA: +5 WIS: +5 INT: +5 AGI: +5 HP: +35 MANA: +35
Endurance: +35

Restrictions -
Slot: HEAD ARMS WRIST HANDS FEET
Required level of 70.
Class: ALL
Race: ALL

That would bring the First Order Boots up to 145hp, easily beating the
Cultural and Armsmaster's. However, firstly the augmentations are not
cheap, and secondly, any type 9 aug which fits into a visible armour slot
*also* fits into type 12 slots, and all DoN Cultural armour has a type 12
slot. So we now have the Cultural Boots with 150hp, beating the First Order
by 5hp and still sustaining the 6ac lead it had already.

The augmentations which are type 9 only (i.e. not type 9/12), fit only into
non-visible slots such as neck, finger, waist etc. and hence don't change
the above table.

These are the best type 9/12 augmentations per slot,

Code:
    chest  legs  wrist  head  hands  feet  arms
hp  40     40    35     35    35     35    35


The first two are both Radiant Ametrine Gemstone (680 crystals) and the
other 5 are all Sparkling Ametrine Gemstone (450 crystals). as well as
adding significantly to HP they also add either resists or stats. There are
other options which include attack or mana regen, but they have reduced
hitpoints and the focus of this document is HP and AC, so they are not
included.

Also note that the required level of those augmentations is 70. For the
First Order armour this is no issue since it is already required level 70,
however when used in combination with the Cultural Armour these augs will
restrict that armour to level 70 characters only. They are still a good
viable upgrade path. If crystals are no issue, then these are the resulting
combined stats using these augs.

Here are the totals using those augmentations,

Code:
                            AC  HP    Minimum Required Level
First Order                 347 1200  70
Grandmaster's Stormguard    452 1330  70
Armsmaster's                395 975   60


It is not possible to use these augmentations in the Armsmaster's Armour
and hence it remains unchanged. If you find it easy to earn Crystals, then
you may feel the additional 290 hitpoints from those augs outweighs the
higher AC of the Armsmaster's armour. Certainly individually, it may make
the First Order armour more desirable than the harder to get Armsmaster's
armour. A single example being perhaps the Greaves, including the augs the
First Order armour is 51ac and 160hp, the Armsmaster's armour remains 57ac
and 130hp. Considering how hard they are to get - it may well be worth
looking at the First Order legs + aug over the Armsmaster's legs. Obviously
if you can, the 81ac and 200hp of the auged Cultural armour are far
superior.

The final question then, what is missing from the information above, what
else do these armours provide. They all provide good enough increases in
the additional base stats, STA, AGI, DEX, etc. and they all provide good
resists. I'm not going to focus on those, but if you a lacking a certain
stat or low in a certain resist you may find one set or one piece
compliments you better. What the various armour sets do provide are focus
effects and other beneficial attributes. They are listed below (some of
these come from the augmentations used in the Cultural Armour, and they may
vary depending on deity, the ones below are for agnostic dwarves).

Code:
First Order      
   additional benefits -> none

Grandmaster's Stormguard
   additional benefits    chest ft +2 / ds +2
                          legs  ft +2 / ds +2
                          wrist attack +15 / ft +1
                          head  regen +3 / ds +2
                          hands attack +30 / regen +3
                          feet  attack +30 / regen +3
                          arms  regen +3 / ds +2
Armsmaster's
    additional benefits   chest Guardian's Boon
                          legs  attack +25 / regen +3
                          wrist attack +20 / regen +2
                          head  ds +4 / regen +4
                          hands plainsight
                          feet  attack +20 / regen +2
                          arms  improved parry 1


Other than saying the First Order obviously lacks in this area, the only
comment would be that each of the benefits must be taken on it's own merit.
If you need plainsight, is it worth taking the Armsmaster's Gloves over the
GM gloves for example.

My opinion is that the GM Armour combined with the Armsmaster's Wrists, is
the best combination you can put together. If the Cultural is out of reach,
the Armsmaster's Armour is the preferred option. The First Order armour is
a good stop-gap while you work towards earning one of the other two.

All three sets will serve you well, but the Cultural Armour is truly the
set to aspire to, for the non-raiding warrior, in the present environment.
