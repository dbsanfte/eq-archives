It all has HP though, I recall being pretty impressed by a nearly full 
set of the stuff on my untwinked beastlord, he nearly doubled his base 
HP with it

Now consider if you will the paladin epic.  First class with an epic, 
and sad it is in comparison with the epics of other classes.  Its a 
pattern; the first people to get some benefit like this get a pretty 
crappy version (but its better than what everyone else gets, which is 
nothing).  Then other people complain they want similar treatment, so 
they get a version tailored to them, which is usually better since its 
no longer an advantage just to have it at all.

Curscale was first.  Vah Shir stuff was next, and its better, plus it 
works on all vah shir classes.  But then they started putting in class 
-and- race specific stuff that was really tuned to what those classes 
and races needed... but in some cases far more difficult.  Now the last 
people to get theirs are looking at all common drop stuff, tradable, so 
ten times easier and still fitted to their needs.

Thats SOE for you, its not about balance, its about making everything 
progressively more powerful, so that latecommers are less handicapped 
than they might be compared against people who started playing back in 
the good old days when Bronze Armor was the big thing.
