If he wants to stay melee, then a Troll Shadowknight is pretty good. 
I soloed mine mostly in Guk.  Still a lot of downtime but doable I
think - unlike Rogue that I can't even imagine trying to solo to 27th.

Bard is probably the best melee soloer but can be tough to master.

  Otherwise a soloing machine is a Wizard with KEI and SOW.  You can
buy both in Nexus easily. I went from 24th to 29th very quickly.  Now
I am trying to get the hang of quadding.

PS I made the same mistake when I first started.  Rolled up a Erudite
Shadowknight.  I gave up after 8 levels of frustration.
