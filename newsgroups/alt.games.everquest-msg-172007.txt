Yes, but not until the skill gets to the 130s or 140s.  Until then, it's
really the best method.

What I recommend is:
Scour the vendors for research components.  This is the best place to find
them.  People sell them for plat a lot.  Search ALL the vendors in popular
spots, like Shadowhaven or Plane of Knowledge.

Go ahead and practice on the spells you already have, or that are
purchasable at a vendor.  Save all components for the research-only spells.

When you hit the next spell level, burn training points to get your research
skill to the max for that level.  THEN attempt to make the research-only
spells.

When I hit level 44, I had several of the items to make the 49 research-only
spells.  This was also when it started getting too expensive to burn points
at the trainer.  Not wanting to spend the next 5 levels practicing, I
decided that it was worth the risk to burn a few of them, and succeeded in
making the 49 spells too.  So I stopped doing research at 44.
