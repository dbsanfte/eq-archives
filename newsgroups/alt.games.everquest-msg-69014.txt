Oh, and one more thing -- although the patch message
warns that initial loading times will be longer
if you turn on caching, since it has to build the
cache files the first time into the game (or a zone),
my stopwatch shows that the initial game entry (during
cache-building) was only ten seconds longer than 
usual, which is hardly an issue when it was 
taking 2:44 to do it overall.

Not even noticeable, really.
