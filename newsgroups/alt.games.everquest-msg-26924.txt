After reading a previous post on "The best 1H weapon" , I found the article
left me sort of thinking I was a total rookie. I mean the guy was talking
about hitting for 512hp, another took 10,000 points of damage from a fall.
WOW what lvl are these guys?

 I left the NG and went to play a while in LOIO and FM where I feel my lvl
29 SK can do pretty good playing that fine line of death. I ran into a
pretty nice fellow who had some awesome armor, a very nice sword, and a
great attitude to boot. Low and behold, he was a lvl 30 SK but seemed to
have nicer stuff then my Fine Plate/ Blackened Alloy stuff.
 After a pretty good conversation, I learned that he saved his money and got
his armor, he quested for his sword, and he preferred to solo as opposed to
grouping. He also told me he has /played 26 days, 12 hours, and I forget the
minutes.

How do you know if your playing EQ right ? This guy seemed to know his stuff
and I am almost positive he was not a Twinkie. (Most Twinks have an attitude
prob. IMO)

I am a level 29 Human SK
I have logged 23 days and some change
I have never quested
I mostly solo
I own
A Dark Reaver 20/42
A Blackened Alloy Bastard sword 24/39
Fine Plate Armor
Blackened Alloy Leggings and Neck
Iksar gloves
and about 380pp in bank due to the fact that SOW potion prices seem high on
Drinal.

 I can hit for 54-68hp X2 on dbl
I max at 870 points of damage I can take
My AC is 635
My Attack is 640 )+7 with GA)

 Now, is this where I should be as a level 29 Human SK ?

Should I even waste my time benchmarking myself against my peers in the
game? Hell I love the game but I some times feel inferior. I am so jealous
of those level 60 players.
