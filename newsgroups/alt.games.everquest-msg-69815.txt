Actually, there is another means of travel that people consistently
forget about or ignore (to my  utter amazement).  There is a room in
Timorous Deep (one of the many zones of EQ) that has a portal system
to 12 diverse locations throughout Norrath (the eq world), and is free
to use by anyone.  Ya just have ta know how to get there.  Often a
druid or wizzie port is easier, but often not (fastes way to get to
LOIO from anywhere near FP, for example).
