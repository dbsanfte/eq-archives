Funny, I imagine that prices will go up, not down.

I sell for half the "going rate" quite frequently, because I hate selling.

If I can just set up an alt to log on when I'm not at my keyboard,
that means a selling bot avaialble 12 hours a day... with no effort
involved.  These are items I don't care about selling all that much
anyway, just seemed too valuable to vendor but not worth the
10Kpp plus that would actually interest me in selling.  I should be
able to offer the items at the "going rate" quite happily, and expect
to occaisionally have a friend offload the loot and buy me some
more peridot or something with the new pocket change.

Why would I offer for less, now that I don't have to worry about
how long it will take to sell?
