Depends on your defination of seamonsters  but there are oceon going critters
that like to wack the unweary. Sharks,crocodiles, etc.
IIRC you cannot be attacked while riding on a boat. Just dont fall off.

>Any underwater cities/ruins etc?

One that springs to mind is Kedge Keep; 
it's a totally underwater zone, but you are a few levels short of venturing
there (approx 30 levels)

I dont believe its possibly to cross the zone lines at sea without actually
being on a boat. Though Sowing/Levitating yourself and running back and forth
the islands in a zone can be equally as fun. Especially if 
  "He's fallen in the water"   (sorry had to put that in there - Spike Milligan
RIP)

Don't drink the water:
"Seriously Don't".  
I mean all those city citizens and not a single out-house between them. It
can't be hygienic.
