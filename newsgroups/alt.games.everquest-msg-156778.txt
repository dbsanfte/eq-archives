I played a wizard and a druid character. I found myself in some bad
situations when I rooted myself with either one and you'd think I would've
learned my lesson. But I think rooting yourself as a druid is worse since it
has that little dd attached to it. Nothing worse then asking your buddy for
a rez and having to tell him that you died because you did something that
goofy. =)
