Each alt skill point takes the same number of "raw" experience
points to achieve.  It doesn't get harder as you raise in levels.
In fact, it gets easier, because you're fighting monsters with
higher exp payoffs when you're higher level.

Not possible, since you earn the points, and *then* decide what
to spend them on.  Thus the game couldn't possibly "charge" you
for more or less exp for a given point, since it can't "know"
how you'll eventually spend it.  Every alt point is the same "size".
