You may find this table to be useful:

Food		Duration (real-life minutes)
Snack		15
Meal		30
Hearty Meal	60
		Duration (real-life hours)
Banquet	        1.5
Feast		2.0

The duration applies if the food is eaten normally. If you force feed
(right-click on food while it is in general inventory slot) the
durations are halved.

A drink is equal to a meal in duration (you need both food and drink).
Alcohol (beer, ale, mean, etc.) is not a drink. You can force feed on
drink too and the effect on duration is the same as force feeding
food.

Btw, if you ever get a potion and want to use it, put it in a general
inventory slot then right-click on it.
