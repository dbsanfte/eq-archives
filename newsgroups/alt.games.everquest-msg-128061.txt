Gyah. I had a problem like that the other day.  Fighting on Orc Highway 
the other night, we got some adds.  I couldn't get aggro off and was 
getting beaten to shit by a yellow and a blue while the others tried to 
fend the other two off the casters.  JUST as I took the hit that dropped 
me, wondering where the heals were, I see the healer say "back."

GRRR.

(Amusingly, about ten minutes later, she asked if she could pull, and 
the puller said sure.  One of the other said "she can't pull, she's our 
healer!" and his answer was "hey, anything to keep her going afk...")
