I just accually read on the prexus boards in the general forum (sorry I
can't link to it from this computer cause the boss blocked it from http)
about this same thing.  Somebody started a topic along the lines of "Did you
get your epic from manaburn?" and a lot of the posts said that they had
indeed bought their epic components from Manaburn wizards.
