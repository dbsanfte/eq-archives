If that's your honest belief, I suspect you also dont read this
group. Merely because people disagree with you doesnt mean they're
SOE sycophants. There's been plenty of reasoned discussion and
uproar when the consensus has been SOE got something wrong. 

This has been said before, but it bears repeating:

People do not object to complaints about game mechanics. People
object to 'I hit myself on the head with a hammer, and it hurt, so
I did it for 12 hours, and now I set fire to my hammer so I never
have to use it again, damn you hammer makers!' complaints.

I seriously doubt a thread like this will change anybodies viewpoint.

You suck! No, you suck! No, You Suck more!
