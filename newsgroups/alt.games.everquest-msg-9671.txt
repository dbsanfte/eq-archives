24 hours? rofl... you flatter yourself far too much. I spent all of...
an hour reading your turgid tripe. Mind you, I was concentrating on
your other alter ego; Habib Delgado

Skipping all the so-so-tedious gumpf about cigars (light it and suck,
ffs, what's to discuss?) and the restaurant business (very deep and
meaningful zzzzzzzz) that left a few interesting posts in some *very*
obscure newsgroups. Didn't take long at all.

Oh yes. Like you did back in 'Nam serving up slop in the canteen?
Still... look what you got out of it; a career after the USA
high-tailed it out of there.
