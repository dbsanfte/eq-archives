 Believe me, I go through all this same sort of stuff everytime I have
to trouble shoot my Father's or Mother's computers (which I stupidly 
provided and even encouraged them to use) over the phone. They've used
these things for about 5 years now each and they STILL cannot fathom the
concept of "folders" or even what a "hard disk" is let alone use them
despite the fact that I go over it everytime I am there with them. They
still just don't get it. Sheesh, when I first started using computers
I have to say it took maybe 4 - 6 months before the virtual light bulb
came on over my head and I actually "got it" but 5 years?
 
 And yes, neither one of them can tell me what email client they have
used for years now (let alone WHAT a client is).
