<<<<<<<<<And right there you contradict yourself.  Allow me to be very clear. 
_If
you are sitting on your ass doing nothing on a regular basis, you are doing
something wrong._   You claim that you have all of the same skills that I
have, yet I'm able to find a way to play without excessive downtime, while
you are not.   Free clue, that is not an accident.

My bet is that our downtime is basically the same because it's programmed that
way.  You are just more of a lap boy who doesn't mind paying to be bored.  Have
you seen how many posts people have made saying things like, "the conversation
with my friends made things almost bearable" and "it sucked ass but we made it
through".  Lol, you keep paying for a bearable game that sucks ass and trying
to convince yourself that it's worth it.  I was having fun with KEI.  I won't
be now and I'll be moving on.  Again.  I'm sure you're happy.  Can you have my
stuff?  No cause I'll be back if they wanna up the mana regen rate or bring
back KEI.  Til then I can find better stuff to do.
