I have to agree.  When I first started playing, I was using a "basic"
(no expansions) starter package, which specifically excluded Luclin
(bazaar) and PoP (books).  It was a blast!  A tarnished weapon (weapon
+ sharpening stone) would have been an upgrade, if I had known what
those were.  I was excited to get a weapon with a Delay/Damage ratio
below 6.  One day, some uber character must have been in a hurry and
left a 7/22 mace (Velium Etched Stone Mace) on one of the Ak'anon
vendors.  I scraped and scrounged and sucked from every money pit I
knew to try to pay the 60-odd plat (so much money!) the vendor wanted
before his inventory was wiped by (in my mind) randomly occuring server
downtime.  I got it!  I still remember playing the "rat lottery",
hoping for one of those tails that sold for over a PLAT!  I could go
on...

Fast forward to my current main.  He was modestly twinked upon creation
(maybe two or three hundred plat worth of gear outgrown by other
characters) and shopped in the bazaar regularly.  It was definitely
fun, being powerful enough to take on tougher monsters.  The first item
he looted that he actually equipped was an Iksar Berserker Club, from
deep in the basement of Kurn's.  That was probably the best item any
character of mine had looted up to that point.  I didn't loot anything
else that I wanted to wear until the late 30's and then only rarely,
even until today at level 60.

Fast forward to today.  I want to try out the new tutorial areas and
quests.  Sadly, I already have 8 characters (levels 17 and up) on my
home server.  So, I roll a brand new shadowknight (a new class for me;
my first "tank" class too) on a brand new server (Stromm, hoping for a
lively newbie experience).  I am poor again!  I have a crappy weapon,
I'm having close fights with *rats*, and my armor is literally made out
of cloth, if I have any at all.  Burlap is an upgrade!  I again have to
scrounge with every trick I know.  I can't even use the bazaar, because
I don't have enough money to buy anything.  Heck, I don't even have
bags in every slot yet.  You know what?  I'm loving it!  I have cheated
modestly.  I exited the tutorial, hunted blues in the Qeynos newbie
yard for some cash, and I bought a 5/22 weapon that was sitting on a
vendor for a few gold.  Uber twink gear! :)  Then I went back in and
found a group to go kill the spider queen!  Along the way, I looted a
No Drop item that gave 5% melee haste.  Woo hoo!  There's another boss
down there who drops a 9/27 sword.  Maybe I'll win that tonight...  Oh,
and I get a new spell *every* level now!  Some of them are less useful
than others, but every level is something to look forward to.  No
longer is it a grind of 4 or 5 levels before anything changes.  At 5, I
got Disease Cloud, my first DoT, and at 6 I got Siphon Strength, my
first self-buff, of sorts.  Next level, I get my first pet.  Mmm...  I
really can't wait to see the new armor quests.  I will enjoy being able
to quest for gear instead of just buying an upgrade.  I think I have 7
plat to my name right now, and at least 4 of that came from quest
rewards.  

Indeed, the slow road is quite fun.
