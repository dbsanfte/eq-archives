A guildmate of mine needed a couple rezzes over the past few weeks.  This
guildmate was a level 42 or so druid at the time (well, he's still a druid
:) ).

My brother's cleric (to whom I have access) was bound at SF/BW the first
time.  The guy died in FM once, and some place in Antonica once.

The first time I told him that he'd have to drag the corpse to the BW zone
line.  The second time that he'd have to come pick me up.  In neither case
did he have any idea where to go.  In both cases I told him he'd have to
figure it out because I don't deliver rezzes any further than I absolutely
MUST.  Both times I suggested that he log off and print a map because I
didn't have time to hold his hand with directions.

The 3rd time he knew better.  He died again in FM and I told him to drag
them to the DL line because it was most convenient to me at the time.  No
complaints, no whining...the boy's growing up. :)
