Classic - hey Loky, if I give you a gavel will you bang it on your keyboard
a few times?

Oh, Oh, miss!  *waves his hand in the air*  Does the fact that I actually
posted to the NG one a a half months before you mean I get a early mark for
little lunch? Please Please Please?  Awwwww....

> We're not "self appointed" regulars - we're regulars. By definition.

By definition? Oh as in "Regulars: persons passing shit freely at frequent
intervals"? Wow - posting 6800 times Loky, you must have been shoving a lot
of prunes up your ass to be able to speak that much shit. I... I... just
feel so.... so... inadequate... what woman could feel satisfied at a mere
420 posts after having known 6800?

Aww - does that mean you can't give me some more of that sexy lawyer talk
Loky? You know that makes me so hot and sweaty....

Yah - but you too stupid to realise I have already pointed out that I know
what a blithering idiot I am already. Now a self confessed idiot makes an
observation in a newsgroup, for a computer game no less, and you stick your
chest out and treat it like courtroom drama? Are you now starting to get an
inkling on why I am shaking my head and thinking what a complete and utter
fuck knuckle you are?

Maybe you need to buy a vowel?

Actually I couldn't figure out how to use that web board so had to come here
instead. Besides, those guys where all too smart and kept picking on me and
hurting my feelings.... *sniffs*

Cheers
One Stupid Idiot to Another.
