what the hell difference does it make HOW long they are AFK or what thier reason is??

I have been playing with my mage and found a really good spot and didn't want to
leave that spot then my frigging wife comes in and says, " Honey, can you go to the
store and pick some stuff for me!" (even tho thats phrased like a question its more
like a command, when it comes from the wife ;-)

I use to camp out then log back on when I got back so 9 out 10 times I lose the camp!
So now I just go afk with pet on spawn point... takes too much time and mana to
resummon and buff pet (with full plate and summoned ac items)

Usually these afk camps are in out of the way places. If I were to do that in MAIN
passageway where there is a lot of traffic by PC's or its a main escape route then I
deserve what I got


BTW, this to that monk!

I have been watching monks lately and I notice that MOST of them and MOST of the time
they are soloing.. they usually pull to a spot nearby someone else, when they get in
over their heads they just FD and the mobs jump that person.

When you complained to the about it... they usually have the AUDACITY to say
something lame like:

"Not my fault... you must have already agro'd them and they just jumped you!!"

HEHE.. sorry not meaning to change thread but I was a little ticked at Mr Monk that
would intentionly train someone that is AFK 
ALSO BTW... if your caught doing that by a GM yes you can get your ass in a sling..
thats called harrassment and it also covered under training to to cause someone to
lose experience.

Have gotten to the point now that I don't even what a monk in my group... not trying
to be prejudice.. but I haven't meet too many Monk, that wouldn't pull crap like that
just cause they got ticked at someone... whether their beef with that person was
legitimate or not!,
