All I could figure is that somebody had set their bind point at the
entry. (Not uncommon if you hunt there a lot. The edge of the rock by
the water is non aggro to the elementals at the entry, and a pretty safe
spot unless a train is happening.

Somebody fights Yael, Nortlav gets aggro'd. Begins wiping the party, and
a caster gates up to the entry. Other than that, I can't figure how he
could make it all the way up there. Nobody could *pull* him there,
obviously, unless it was some sort of intentional situation like above.
But could you imagine the train?
