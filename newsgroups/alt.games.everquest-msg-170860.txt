*chuckle*
Calm down man.  I can't recall Taras mentioning Limbaugh "in any other
post" (his words, he did not deny mentioning him in this thread).  I've
taken a shot or three at Limbaugh, and I think a couple other people
might have done so as well, but I honestly don't recall Taras doing so.

Tell you what, in keeping with the "Peace on Earth" spirit of the
season I will refrain from any political statements whatsoever here.

May the Lord bless you and keep you, may He make his face shine upon
you and give you peace.

Merry Christmas :)
