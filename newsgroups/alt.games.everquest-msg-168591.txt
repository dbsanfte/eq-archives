Everquest's Economy is a free wheeling buyer beware operation.

The rule is simple.

 Charge as much as the market will bear.  If the buyer doesn't like the
price, he/she can go somewere else to buy.  Easy really.

Other than that, the camparitive markets to the real world?  No relation at
all really once you stop and think about it.

I have done the market place dicker on a few occasions.  It was fun for both
of us.  Got down to basic insults, the hungry children, the husband needing
surgury.. You know what I mean I am sure.  You could do that at the EC
tunnel almosy anytime if the seller was willing to deal.

In the Bazaar, 75% of the time, the dealer is not at home.  It is a
self-serve market.  Prices set, no way to deal and dicker it down a bit.

Oh well.

As to the arguments about the differing forms of governments?  Silly.  The
best form is Communism...If you are an Ant, our a robot.  Pure Democracy is
Anarcy in waiting.  Monarcy isn't good, but less evil than the pure
dictatorship.  The representive Republic that the Romans built, and the
founding Fathers of the USA based the govt on is overall the Best way to go.
The populus has some say in Who goes to office, and some control on issues
if the holder pays attention to his electors.( most do not now days. :(  )
But if you look closely at the current state of the USA system, we are
slowly and painfully following the Romans footstep into Empire.  It is sad
really.  It was the same welfare system, sudden rapid growth into and over
all known regions, that in the end doomed the Republic.

The Islamic system has taken the place of the invaders of the north.  If
that system ever takes over the world.......  No non arib will live long
enough to notice most likely.  I think I have rambled on Enough now.
