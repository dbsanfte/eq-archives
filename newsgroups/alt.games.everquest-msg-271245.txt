I am coming to view it as both.

Ineffective cause everyone has it and (from what I can tell) less and
less people are starting to care about it.  It has become the 'norm' to
have debt and a short-lived treat to not have it (I have come to view
time without debt as soe giving me a fleeting 50% XP bonus).  When you
are out of XP debt, said condition is usually persistent for less than
an hour.

Surprisingly (to me anyhow), this has translated into a significant
amount of additionaly ingame enjoyment for me and quite a few others I
have talked/grouped with.  We tend to venture further into the world;
see new places, fight new mobs and get some pretty good loot.
Additional debt doesn't have any present affect on our advancement (we
will still level relatively soon and won't lose our level if we die
afterwards).

Don't get me wrong, I have not one to die unnecessarily and will run
everytime I know a fight is fruitless; I just find myself laughing
instead of stressing out if I don't make it to the zone...  Which leads
me to the conclusion that it has been effective in making the game even
more enjoyable.  I don't know if soe intended to make char death less
tramatic; if they did, IMO they succeeded.

Opposing viewpoints?
