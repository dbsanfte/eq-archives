Puller: tradition says Monk or Shadow Knight or Warrior or Paladin.
However, don't rule out any class.  For example, if you had a group of low
50's with a 60 Wizard, and were doing Kedge, the Wizard might be the best to
pull from Phinny's area, because of level.  He would get singles where the
lower level players would not.  Or a Druid or Ranger might be best in some
situations because of Harmony.  Much depends on whether you are fighting
casting mobs or not...casting mobs might *require* someone with high HP to
survive the pull.

MT: Whoever's HP bar will go down the slowest, so generally Warrior, Shadow
Knight, Paladin...the high HP/high AC classes.

MA: anyone who won't have a reason to be targeting anything else should be
able to handle this.  In groups, usually the MT.
