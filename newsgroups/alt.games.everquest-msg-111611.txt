  That's odd.  In my experience, "meat" of most types drop more infrequently
than bone chips off of decaying skeletons.  Considering the fact that there
are skeleton mobs right next door to Cabilis, and other places where you can
rake in tons more bone chips than you can meat (Paineel newbie yard) I don't
see why this would be a particularly valuable skill to have.

  How many bone chips does flesh to bones yield per chunk of meat?
