Shaman-Calm and helpful, you will assist those in need. You are very stolid, but will
fight when your rights or the rights of those you love are in danger. You are very just
when making decisions, much like a paladin, but you consider both sides with even more
care. You should become a supreme court judge.

Mmmm... Ok.
