At one point, it was Gnome Cleric to Bertoxx. They are KOS in the cleric 
guild in Ak'Anon, and there wasn't an evil gnome cleric trainer in the 
necro area. They were KOS to dwarves and elves and in Freeport. They had 
to travel all the way to Qeynos basement to find an evil cleric trainer 
and buy spells. It's much easier now that there's a cleric trainer in 
the evil area, and one can buy spells there.

Definitely a class that is best left agnostic gets more challenging with 
an evil religion. Definitely races  with less than optimum stats such as 
half-elves are tougher.

Gnome clerics are also tougher because they have the worst wis in the game.

I would think a Tunare worshipping wood elf warrior would have a tough 
time being taken seriously. (I have one- she's 13. Folks keep asking her 
for SOW). They also have STR and sTA issues. Plus all religious stuff 
isn't oriented toward fighting types, and the warrior gear isn't aimed 
at Tunare worshippers.

I should think human SKs would have a tough time of it too, for faction 
issues and low stats. The obscure spells are sold in Paineel and the 
Ogre SK guild, and humans don't have the faction for either unless they 
work on them.
