same with an evac at EL camp in SolB.
While all my group members where ported to Nektulos forrest, I ve been
ported to the entrance of SolB (LS zone line)
The only pbl was i were still in hate list of the train of imps protectors
who found their way up to zone to finish their nasty job killing me. I zoned
with 50hp or so, i cant tell the same of stupid guys hunting in the hall,
stucking everybody.
