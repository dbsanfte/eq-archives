Considering the spell blows asschunks, I wouldn't pay more than 500 for it.

No one EVER wants to buy it either.

Besides, at 60 you get Mask of the Hunter/Stalker which doesn't stack with
the 54 Form of the Howler (mana regen conflict), and since wolf form sucks
(thx KoS faction with everything), no one would use the 60 wolf, especially
over SoE/Mask.  If you need wolf form (like for infiltrating Oggok), use the
level 44 one and keep Mask up for mana regen.
