This subject gets beaten to death every few months here.  What it boils
down to is that in a pickup group of strangers NBG is a lie used to
promote the greed of players who only go where the loot they want drops.
In a guild group or in a group of friends it is different.  These are
people who will (presumably) go with you to the place where loot you
want for your character drops (or they've already been there with you!).
Why in hell would a_shaman01 go looking for a pickup group at monkcamp01
unless one of those conditions (straight random of droppables among
strangers or NBG among friends/guildmates) prevailed?
