Apparantly you are now incorrect.  But to say its true because
cleric is a "priest" class has ALWAYS been incorrect, look at
shaman, who like clerics now, could produce quite credible
damage by melee plus pet plus DOT, or druids, who's damage
output via DD/DOT has always been top tier along with
casters.  Clerics and Enchanters were bottom tier damage
dealers, now clerics have moved off that bottom rung of the
ladder leaving chanters there alone.

At 60, self buffed, I am at the level of a very crappy unbuffed warrior,
and besides, what interest to me is an unbuffed warrior.  Just as
you should expect to see me with KEI 90% of the time whether
there's a chanter in my group or not, I fully expect a 60 warrior to
have Aego 90% of the time; these buffs last a LONG time, and you
should be friends with sufficient clerics to always be able to get one
(warriors and clerics are natural buddies, a strong symbiotic relationship,
like that between chanters and clerics)

Damage mitigation means mana efficiency.  HP total means mana
efficiency (if a cleric is healing)  Mana efficiency means kills per hour.
No, I don't want a cleric sponging any more than I want a rogue sponging;
sure there are situations where I -can- do the job, but its going to
suck to be sitting so much more than I should have to between fights.

This from a cleric who's spent significant amounts of time duoing
with a ranger and deliberately acting as the sponge; give a choice
between those two classes, cleric was the better choice.  But we
had a ranger doing damage, not something lame like a warrior.

If I'm rooting and chain stunning, then you can write off all that melee
damage I was supposed to be doing.  And you left out flash of light.
Root, Flash, Stun is a much more mana efficient aggro holding combination
than Stun Holy Might Force Root.

CAN supply healing and WANT to blow all that mana inefficiently
are two different things.  I want to be able to stick to CHeal and have
that hitting for 4K plus, rather than using smaller heals that get me
1K in HP per same amount of mana, or even using CHeals that
buy me a mere 2500hp... less mitigated 2500hp too.  I'm not
a Sponge.  Neither are rangers or rogues.  Monks arguably are,
but thats a totally different subject.

A warriors job is NOT to do damage.  Frankly you suck at that.  Stop
thinking its your main job.  Warriors SOAK.  At soaking you are
on top of the heap.  As a cleric, warrior soaking is the best there is,
although I'd like to see it improved by adding more damage mitigation,
seems to me AC isn't working the way it should.  If you have a druid
or shaman as healer, you would probably be better off with a monk
MT in most situations, thats sad.

But who gives a Brell's Backwash about a warriors dps?  Stop thinking
damage you will never compete.  Complain about other classes catching
up with you in soaking ability.  If mobs damaged you half as much as
they currently do, this would improve your solo ability (kill the mobs
before they kill you) your small group ability (group kills mob before
it kills you) your full group ability (cleric spends less mana healing you,
so your group kills more mobs per hour) and to a lesser extent your
raid ability (IF you are MA then this improves the whole raid... but
if you are one of the remaining horde of tanks, your improved mitigation
means exactly Jack.)
