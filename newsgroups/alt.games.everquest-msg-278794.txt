Yes, they had to make changes to how snare affected the game because it was
so powerful. I didn't go into detail about snare. I was pointing out that
snare is one of the three most powerful skills in the game, but rarely
mentioned when someone goes on a complete heal/slow rant. History has shown
me that this is usually due to the fact that the person complaining can
snare but can't slow or complete heal.
