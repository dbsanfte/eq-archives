Last night I started a new mule character. (Gnome Rogue to do
tinkering/pottery/poison). I brought out my Druid to do a little
powerleveling. I buffed up the little guy and cast a damage shield on him
and let him go. Now I know in the past that he would have had to do at least
1 point of damage by himself to get experiance for the kill, but last night
I noticed that many times he did not even hit (the damage shield did all the
damage and made the kill) and he still got experiance. It's been a while
since I did some powerleveling, did this change recently??
