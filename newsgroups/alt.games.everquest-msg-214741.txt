Lol. Cute.

I see it more as:

Coach42. Jimmy, you don't show up for practice enough, so I'm going to 
have to cut you from the team.

Jimmy. But, but, I want to play wiht my friends and help them get goals.

Coach42, I'm sorry Jimmy, but the rules are rules. You knew that you had 
to be at 60% of the practices when you joined the team. It wouldn't be 
fair to the other players to let you have ice-time when you aren't at 
practice enough. I'd have to bench you at all the games. So you are 
effectively off the team.

Jimmy. But, but, their my friends! Aren't you my friend? What will I do? 
I just want to hang out with my friends!

Coach42. No more of that Jimmy. This has nothing to do with 
'friendship'. This isn't a game you know. This is hockey [EQ]. "Friends" 
don't have rules about when they're allowed to hang out and "friends" 
don't need policies to determine who's allowed to get goals. Here in 
Hockey [EQ] we have rules and policies and you agreed to them. But you 
didn't abide by them so you can still be our "friend" but your off the 
team.
