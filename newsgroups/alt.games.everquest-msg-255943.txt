    Considering most people have to FIND a LDoN group, I think both counts
are unrealistic.

    It usually takes us closer to 30minutes to get organised, and a normal
now takes 30mins or less, but if my groups are average I'll eat my goranga
idol.

    I blew 140k in the bazaar last night on gear you would laugh at. I
really am not at all sympathetic to you having to pay 10,500 or even 21k for
gear I won't see during the next 12 months of play.

    Most of the cash I get comes from selling drops to players even worse
off than I am. (well actually, it comes from a friend selling all our drops)

    I'd be scratching SCF while I'm at it. Plenty of AA's that have slightly
more effect than that are not on that list.

    Aside from that and  harm touch junk, that about sums up my AA list.

    Yeah I'm slowly working on DPS, MC3 and soul abrasion, and will want US
for those murderous GoD runs, especially since I am Captain Summon usually.

    However, these are NOT urgently needed AA's. The only one that really
counts is Soul Abrasion, and given that it hasn't scaled with mob DPS
increased, it doesn't really help anymore either.

    In that case, I retract that comment... clearly clerics have more
desirable AA's than SK's.

    Shouldn't be. Just about 100% of the population LDoN's. How much of the
population raids or hits high level GoD? How uch effort have they spent
tweaking that stuff of late?

    Yeah, the barriers have come down but so have the relative rewards.
Mudflation.
