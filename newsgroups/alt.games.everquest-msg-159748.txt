Assuming you are still using the same account, there shouldn't be anything
stopping you from downloading all of luclin as a patch and playing there, since
the account is already registered there.

On the other hand, if you've really started fresh, on the cheap with a free copy
of just the original game, you are going to have a hard time buying much of
anything, as almost all trade has moved to the bazaar, to me the most successful
of their "gotta have that expansion" moves, sadly not implemented until LONG
after the expansion itself was released.
