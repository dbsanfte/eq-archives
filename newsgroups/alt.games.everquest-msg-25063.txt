Ok, Biz. Since you seem to be in normal "dick mode" let's look back at
what I *actually* said.

>Then somebody pointed out that, not only can't you cast,

Did you catch the "... not *only* can't you cast" part, which confirms
that I *did* read it...... oh. Obviously you didn't. Let me fall down in
shock.

No more different, eh? Bottom of the ocean near a zone line. Ok. Right.

Sorry... could you post again where it said you were restricted to only
new characters with disposable weapons? In my admitedly limited
experience, most guilds bring along some higher levels for monitoring,
and they often get silly and join in the fun. Also, you've *never* been
in a duel where the last couple shots turn into an unexpectedly large
nuke when the lag makes you think the opponent has more hit points than
they actually do? Or the last couple swings have a massive crit?
Ummmm.... ok.

Totally agree.

Hello?...... Is this on? You lose stamina massively on a ship on a long
ride. And the rides you are talking about are LOOOOOONG. Doesn't work.
What? You're suddenly upset that I might have the *audacity* to question
an idea of yours? Get over yourself, big boy. :-)

Fun event. Remind me to plan one.

Hrmmm.... throw away low level characters with disposable weapons....
their buffs will last *how* long on one of those long cruises? Gee...

Yeah, but when the climate conditions make the dueling effectively
futile and pointless, what kind of event is that? Oh, that's right. You
can't ever admit you're wrong about anything. Sorry. I forgot.
