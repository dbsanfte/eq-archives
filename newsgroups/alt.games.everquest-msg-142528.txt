Well I suppose you could ask . The real cost of taxation is when people who
would work without that taxation stop working because of it. Ayn Rand wrote
a very nice fictional work trying to illustrate this. When they stop working
because of taxation then that venture capital and ALL of the investments
that would have come from it are lost forever. The ability of compounded
interest over time and the "stuff it constructs" is what you lose .
