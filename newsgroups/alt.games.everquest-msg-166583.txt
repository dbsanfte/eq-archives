Apparently, it's a bug which has something to do with being unable to have
two identical non-stackable items on the cursor at the same time. The splits
are *supposed* to proved two of the smaller bricks from each larger
block/brick, but the EQ engine can't currently handle it.

And, no, I don't remember exactly where I saw this - I *think* it was from
EQTraders, in either a Fan Faire report or a Dev Chat thingy.

But don't quote me. =)
