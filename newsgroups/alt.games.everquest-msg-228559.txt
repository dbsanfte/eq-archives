People couldn't pay me to take this pet (ok, I suppose I'd take a free
copy of 63 fire on the off chance I might duel someone, sometime).

I vastly prefer Malosini to the earlier spells in the line, quick casting
and a very fast recast.  Yes, against MR mobs it's a pain - but, since it
drops all resists but disease, it is VERY useful to set up other nuke 
lines.

Haven't expedienced my pet in ages.  Never bothered with velocity - too
much money, too little benefit.

Double check lucy - TPP/XPG don't stack with PoTC/PoT9 line, they do
stack with Temp,Aego,Virtue.  When I don't have a druid in the group
(rare) I use Virt/XPG - when I do I use PoT9/Kazad.
