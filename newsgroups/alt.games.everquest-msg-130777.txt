Please check out the question. No reference to "taking sides"......I've
spoken only my own opinion, and can't answer for others in this debate. The
intentional targeting of non-combatants is murder, pure and simple, and it
doesn't matter if you claim to be oppressed, or if you claim to be defending
against terrorism.  The key words, from my point of view, are "intentional
targeting" and "non-combatants"......I have yet to see any evidence to
support the claim that Israeli women and children should be classified as
combatants, or how, by strapping an explosive charge to your body, and
detonating it in an area specifically chosen for it's proximity to
non-combatants,  one could  make an argument that these deaths were
unintentional. When that behavior stops, the peace process begins. Would I
support Israel if they were attempting genocide? No. Do I support the
killing of unarmed Palestinians? No. But as long as *some* of the
Palestinian people practice "murder for political purposes", and *none* of
the Palestinian leadership does anything to prevent it, Israel will continue
to do what the Irsaeli leadership sees fit to do in defense, no matter how
long we discuss it here....
