Since I'm not interested in farming xp, I've done almost no MMs.
(I also tend to lag on buying expansions, so people have usually
gotten tired of the MMs by the time I'm able to do them.)  How
tuned are they to a full group?  I.e., how small a group can you
expect to take in and still win?  (And how much does the answer
depend on which MM it is?)
