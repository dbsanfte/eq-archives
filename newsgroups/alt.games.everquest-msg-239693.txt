More like 13 centuries (or more)... But, who's counting?  As the crusades
occurred in the 14th century, the "Christian" Romans persecution on the
Goths (later the Visigioths) occurred in the the 8th (?) century, it's been
going on for a long time.  Atrocities in the name of religion are, well, the
norm over the course of history.
