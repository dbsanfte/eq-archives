I've decided to get my char into tailoring. I spent points into tailoring
and at 21 it said "you must first learn advanced abailities in this field"
or something similar.

I also found a merchant near Halas (I went there because of all the polar
bear cubs) and bougth a STACK of ruined pelts which quickly got me up to 26.

A few questions:

- What are these advanced abilities? How do I train them?

- Are there any sites that explain tailoring?

- How does the large sewing kit work? The small one works fine, but whatever
I try the large sewing kit gives me "you cannot combine these items".

Thanks,

Maarten
