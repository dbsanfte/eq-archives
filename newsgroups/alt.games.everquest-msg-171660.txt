"NOT ANOTHER FREAKIN WINDOW!?!?"

-- 
Ryou
(likes the UI, mind you, but is starting to lose the ability to actually 
*see* anything what with 2 buff windows, a pet window, a spellcast 
window, a group window, a target window, 2 chat windows, hot buttons, 
that little window where you set up all your hotbuttons, a little window 
to get rid of windows, like there are any you can get rid of... no 
wonder they got rid of the spell book when meditating, it's now 
redundant :p)
