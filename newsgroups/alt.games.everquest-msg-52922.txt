Wandewring round lake rathetear I foind a bunch of ogres, most obviously
dufrenite hitters for the shaman quests. One however talks about red
objects under the sea by the Aviak dive....so I wander over.

Down there I find an object on the floor. Pick it up, its an unjewelled X
hilt. I think...give it to the ogre and see...nothing...Allakhazam dont
seem to list it..

Any ideas on the object (I assume its quest since it lore magic nodrop)
