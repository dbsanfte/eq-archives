Well, Blizzard did it intentionally to stress the servers. They started 
out good and then started purposefully causing problems and even took 
half the servers down at times to further concentrate the player base.

No kidding. If they REALLY wanted the separation they should have called 
it "Shards of Norrath" or something like that. They WANT people to 
associate it with EQ so they will get those people to buy the game.

I think the SOE bigwigs will force them to release, ready or not. Sounds 
like they *should* push it until like March, just like the original EQ, 
but I don't see that happening this time. 

Personally I'm not sure if WoW will have a real long term appeal, so it 
might be a LOT smarter for EQ2 to wait until March so that they can 
catch all the people leaving WoW for the next big thing. I could be 
wrong about WoW, and they are adding crap all the time, but the big 
complaint of WoW seems to be no high-end content in the game (well, 
level cap content). All the raid dungeons and PVP battlezones, etc are 
still in.

LOL. From what I have heard in regards to the graphics issues, it sounds 
a LOT like the original AO where they couldn't figure out how to 
technically have the all those people/customizations in the same area. 
If so, this is a fundamental technical issue that won't be resolved in 
the short term.

Yeah, built-in guild sites and also a character web page for each 
character on your account with equipment/stat info. They really 
smartened up and added all the stuff that people were going to 3rd 
parties for before.
