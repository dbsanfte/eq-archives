Well, we like rangers in Wyrd Angles.....though we really we have
abandoned the plan to take Vox on with a vast armies of rangers despite
what people might say....

We arent into heavy RP, we are into fun cooperative play and social
entertainment. As well as raiding a number of good areas, we have a good 
rapport with Heros of Kaladim (as nice a bunch as you could meet) who we 
have done the cooperative raids with and have a LFG channel with to do
pickup groups. We also do more light hearted events... like naked 1st lvl
trolls running from Grobb to Freeport, drunk monks in Kithicor and the
Great Gnome Gfootrace......Akanon to Qeynos with 1st lvl  gnomes....

wyrdangles.moonfruit.com is the guildwebsite, and there is an Ezboard as
well, linked from the main site but if you go direct from ezboard you'll
find it as well.
