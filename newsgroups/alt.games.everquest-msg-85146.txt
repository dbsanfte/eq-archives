True, and complete rubbish respectively. For people who will spend
120pounds on a lunch (what, 220 dollars?) 30 dollars extra is
nothing - its a tip.

For people who would spend only 80 pounds on a dinner, its still
cheap.

The point is, its not how many times more expensive it is, its how
much it matters to you and if you, lets say, play twice a week
for four hours a time, but 30 dollars over the course of a month
is *nothing* to you, and you think it will make those eight hours 
more enjoyable, then its most certainly "cheap".

Cheap is relative to how much disposable income you have.

This is the interesting one. I'm thinking mayube... just maybe... there'll
be fewer kids and more adults. We'll see ;) I'm considering giving
it a try to see how it pans out with my druid, while leaving my main
with all the friends I've made on normal-EQ.

>Things like... a life.

Well, duh. But that applies to 10 dollars as much as 40.

>>I agree that the web page stuff is just fluff, and the new map isn't worth $30

The page stuff is kinda interesting, in that I would assume its auto
built from the EQ data, rather than requiring constant manual updating,etc.

Given the comment about relative "cheapness" outlined above, I'd think
there are folks who might pay a little more (2 dollars? 4?) a month for
that service for their characters and guild rosters such that they didnt
have the hassle of updating everything manually. I know if I were responsible
for our guilds website I'd consider it. For a large guild keeping that
roster accurate must be a total PITA.

The interesting thing about this, though, is that if they dont deliver
you can just go back to your old server and pay a tenner a month. So for
that extra 30 they'd better deliver something *compelling* for their
8000 "lemmings", or the revenue goes away.
