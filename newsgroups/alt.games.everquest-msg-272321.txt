That is not a legitimate answer at all.

Everyone knows the level curves are completely out to lunch at the low 
end game in both titles. Nobody expects progress at level 2 to be like 
progress at level 30 even in the same game, nevermind the absurdity of 
comparing level 2 progression to level 20+ progression in a different 
title.

Clearly level 20-30 isn't the 'same' in both games. But its a reasonable 
starting point.

No, even level 50 to 70 aren't -necessarily- correspondant. I'd favour 
50 to 50. Given that EQ1 was originally released with a level cap of 50. 
And EQ2 is likely to follow EQ1s general pattern for expansions.

Maybe, but I doubt it. But if you want to run it that way. State that is 
what your doing, and perform your analysis with that assumption.

Then make the assumptions. It doesn't matter if they are wrong. Provided 
they are reasonable. (And if they aren't: debate will ensue.)

That depends. I can solo 100 light blues in EQ with nearly any class, at 
a rate of 6-10/hour at most level ranges. Can I solo 100 Oranges in EQ2 
in the same amount of time?

*I think that is the question Annie was asking.*

I get what your saying but it doesn't really matter.

Yes actually, you can. Really. You just state what your assumptions of 
the relevant unknowns are.

Clearly the 20s are the beginning of the midgame of EQ2; it makes sense 
to compare them to the 20s of the 'old EQ' (before hotspots, mudflation, 
Paludal Caverns, level caps being raised, AAs etc distorted everything.)
