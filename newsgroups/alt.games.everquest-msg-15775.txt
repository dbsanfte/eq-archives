Last night I was helping a friend get a bloodstainded tunic in Unrest.  It
drops off the undead knight in the tower.  We managed to scrounge together
an almost full group of 29-32's and with invisible to undead, we made it to
the top of the tower.  There were 3 hags which we managed to kill with
little problem and we got a couple of adds which were also killed.  As we
waited medding, I noticed that we were getting argo'ed through the floor
from the barkeep room below.  I though I had read about that so we sent a
puller down to get the stuff up.  We did and all was well for about 15 min.
The guy stationed in the room below called "inc" and pulled up about 3
carrion ghouls.  As we were fighting, we kept getting add after add. I mean
everything.  Hags, Werebats, Greater skellies, Monks... You name it.  All
about 20-30 seconds apart.  We actually were doing a halfway good job
keeping up but alas, the mana started to get low and the HP's were getting
down too so the primary healer called "evac" and we took off for the zone.
Hated to leave the massive pile of corpses too AND the undead knight who
spawned near the end.   Anyway, We made it to the zone by jumping out the
windows of the tower to get a head start on the mobs (ploit?) and medded
safely.   We didnt know if the massive amount of mobs was a train or some
mob wandered but after medding, we went back in.  This time, We checked the
barroom and found it empty and headed up to the tower room.  It was empty
except for a greater skelli so we moved in and killed it.  About that time,
we were argo'd through the floor and the same damb thing happened 15-20 mobs
of all types came trickling in...  Massive fighting and eventual retreat.
So...

How do we safely camp the top of the tower at level 30?

Thanks in advance
