Any priest class can do it: cleric, druid or shaman.

The best thing about the elven chainmail is the unusual look. It's
also pretty damned good druid stuff: it has AC, cha, wis (int is
irrelevant here) and magic resistance. Tunare leather has cha and wis
buffs (higher cha than wis) so it seems to fit; the wis/int raises are
quite high so the fact that the stuff has both doesn't mean that
you're giving up wis to get int, it's just the adjustment made to make
the stuff good for both caster types involved.
With the price hopefully dropping now that blue diamonds aren't a
prerequisite, I might try to get some elven chainmail one day just to
have yet another set of dress up armor :)
