Hmm not bad idea. And when they are charmed (chanter) they turned back to
normal, very useful for assisting and such... Also you would instantly see
which mobs are pulled with it. I have the same problem sometimes when I am
pulling zelniaks and wolves in Dawnshroud. Even when my zelkniak is lighting
up like a walking christmastree from all the snare, dots and nukes..

Can't see any downsided atm.. sure there must be some otherwise they would
have already put it into the game, hehe.
