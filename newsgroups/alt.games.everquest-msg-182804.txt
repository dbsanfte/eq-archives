I so completely disagree. IMO the buffs are the business of the caster
and it is up to them whether or not they want to cast it. 

I recall as a druid in group I had no problem declining buffs if I
felt they were an unnecessary use of mana. I obviously never felt PotG
was unnecessary (unless it was all melees packing Aego or something)
but some others just weren't worth bothering with; I'll hold mana to
blast thanks. Same with enchanter; I often had people ask for
alacrity. I would give augmentation instead; it lasts far longer and
therefore isn't nearly as big a drain on my mana if there's several
people needing. A couple people complained... and I ignored them. I'm
the one who knows where my mana is best used.

It is the CASTER'S mana. Buffs are at THEIR discretion. If the caster
believes it's better not to cast a requested buff, then they should
stick to their guns unless there's some obvious reason not to.
