Oddly enough a similar situation came up yesterday.  We were faction 
hunting in Icewell to atone for killing Vindi, and there were the usual 
collection of friends, twinks, and random grubbers hanging around.  We 
were giving the unwanted RFV pieces to those who were waiting politely.  
We were warning that we would start destroying excess if anyone attempted 
to ninja loot.  Sure enough, we pulled a bunch, one of which dropped a BP.  
By the time we finished the adds, a 20ish bard running around invis had 
ninja'd the BP.  
We asked him about it, he then trained us, we petitioned.  Guide showed 
up, marked the account, escalated to GM, and hopefully will transfer the 
BP to one of our recruits today.  The account was warned for not only 
ninjaing, but also for harrassing us.  The bard was invis, so really 
wasn't causing much of a disruption, or so he said.  The guide did not buy 
that argument, and stated that just being there when we asked him to leave 
was harrassment.  I suspect that the fact that the person has been 
petitioned before had something to do with it, but the guide made it 
pretty clear that being where someone else is raiding (even a gimpy 
faction raid) when they've asked you to leave is petitionable.
