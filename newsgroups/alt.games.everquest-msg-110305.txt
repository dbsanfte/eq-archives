53 - determined to get to 60. I mentioned IC because that is one place I
used to quad and it is an illustration of an "Out of the way place". Now I
quad in TD (when I quad), I actually group most of the time. Trying to quad
in places like CS is simply a nightmare because of the the druid bashing
going on. The place is also taken over by AE groups.

I see you read some of my previous posts, but I will say it again anyway. I
am NOT bitching about the druid class - I bitch about the druid bashers. The
incessant whining and bitching about how overpowered druids are (by
non-druid players) has contributed to the the dilution of even their base
class abilities - while every other class in the game has become
considerably more desireable. I'm not asking for a CH, but taking 2 seconds
off the cast time and 100 mana off Nature's touch is not going to make
Druids "Uber", but will make a 60 level heal more useful than a 55 level.

Yeah yeah, Monk's get Mend. Most people probably figured out I was talking
about AA First Aid. For 3 AA points at 51st you can bandage to 80% Health.
Warriors also get Regen at 51st and 55th, and a better bandaging at 59th. I
never gave it much thought, but it looks like pure warriors can be pretty
good downtime healers at 59th.

As far as downtime, the math is pretty similar for druids (excellent
soloers) who need to med back 2700 mana at 15 per tick. We don't get "mana
bandages" though. We also don't get any mana regen from AA until 55th.

Anyway, the point still remains. There is equipment/abilities available that
makes warriors competent soloers *IF* that is what they choose to do. While
there are few items that make Druids better groupers. Something to think
about when debating the "balance" of the game where balance relies on
warrior's ability to group versus a druids ability to solo.

To tell the truth, I don't even know if there is a slowing weapon in the
game. But I do know that a weapon procing Engulfing Darkness for warriors is
easily gotten in CoM because I got one. I gave it to the cleric though to
sell.

One of my best friends in the game plays a 51 Druid and 53 Monk. His monk
has WAY less downtime than the druid. The Monk can bandage to 100%. Along
with mend, he claims to never have more than 6 minutes downtime.
