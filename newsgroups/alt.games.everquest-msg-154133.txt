I NEVER send tells to individuals in game asking them to buff me as I
consider this rude.  Usually if I do get KEI it is in the bazaar/nexus area
from people who are /ooc that it is up for donations.  My minimum donation
for it is 50pp and goes as high as 100pp depending on how much I happen to
have handy/available.  As to the anon business I personally do not use it
except in the case mentioned elsewhere in this thread where my guild or
group of close friends is racing to get to a rare spawn that has not been
grabbed.  Kei does have an addictive quality as it keeps my ranger from ever
having to stop when fear kiting in Jagged Pines
