This becomes abundantly clear when you spend time raising a poor weapon
skill at higher level.  When I finally decided to do Piercing with my
Paladin I had only about 30 training points banked to start it with.
I picked up a Centi Warspear for a whopping 10pp and headed into LGuk
where I figured I could solo even with such a low skill.  The first few
fights took a fair long while, I think most of my damage in the first
15 or 20 came from the Instrument of Nife proc, and I don't think I had
a hit for over the "magic number" (2x base + bonus) until my skill was
in the mid-70s.  My first hit for better than 3x + bonus was somewhere
around 130-140 skill.  This was as a L53 with maxxed Offense (209 or
something like that) vs. light-blue and low blue cons.
