I didn't see that one.  There is a real problem with the refreshing of
available items.  I saw a Cann IV spell for sale for 200pp, rushed over to
the PC, wasn't there.  Logged out a couple times over the course of the
evening, ended up checking in the Bazaar one last time before camping for
the night, and the spell was still showing up as being available, so I
checked again, and it still was not there.
