Not that particular problem, but if I run the patcher thru EQW I do
have video lag and display problems that are generally only soluble
by a reboot.  I've been able to avoid these problems by not running
the patcher thru EQW and rebooting prior to using EQW after patching
(usually just use alt+enter when I play after patching).  I'm running
Win2k on an Athlon XP1600+ with 512MB RAM and a GeForce2ti 64MB video,
for any who think platform might matter to this behavior.
