Prices also vary from moment to moment:

1.  A seller may be in a hurry to raise cash for an item and
thus be willing to unload their stuff at prices too good
to pass up.

2.  A seller may hate auctioning and just name a price that's
sure to sell quickly.

3.  A seller may refuse to sell an item for less than he
can possibly get for it, and if he's the only one selling
it at the moment, you'll have to pay his high price.

4.  A buyer may be in a hurry for an item and offer much
more than the nominal price in order to entice someone to
make a trip to the bank to sell him one.

5.  A buyer might drive a hard bargain and argue the
price down quite a bit.

Etc., etc.

Free-market prices are determined by the minute-to-minute
interplay between the situations of the buyers and sellers
which are actively participating at the time, there's
really no such thing as a "true" or "accurate" price.
