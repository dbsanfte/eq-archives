Both of the EQ computers I've been on since the patch
exhibit this problem.

For example, the "change Hotkey bank" keys (shift-1 through
shift-0) have been swapped with the "cast a spell" keys
(alt-1 through alt-8).

And yes, I use standard US keyboards.

Many other (but not all) key assignments which had ALT
or SHIFT in them had the alt/shift keys reverse as well.
