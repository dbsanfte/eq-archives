First of all, you can't draw conclusions from such a small sample of tries.

Smithing skill is all that comes into play on successes or failures.  Wisdom
and strength are only for skillups, and according to the most recent work
done in this area, only your wisdom will be checked (unless your INT happens
to be higher -- you didn't mention that value)

This increases your effective skill by 5%.

No.  The 5% failure rate is the lowest failure rate you will ever get, even
if you smith the lowest trivial item at a grandmaster level skill.  You will
generally not hit this point where you are on the skill curve until quite a
bit past the trivial level.  I'm not sure of the exact trivial for the
acrylia boning, but assuming it is about 37 or so, you will still fail close
to 8% of the time with the Geerlok hammer.

If you manage to combine several stacks without skilling up, your numbers
should approach the 8% mark.  The bottom line is that 10 combines is just
too small a sample to draw any conclusions from.

I hope this helps!
