Yep, Gunthak beach is great for a pallie.  Yesterday I ran into two
guildies with their pallies there.  They were 36 and 39 and were
having a ball with all the undead!

But, I was on as my 50 beastlord and there wasn't anything there for
me to get exp with so... I invised them up and took them to the zone
in of Nadox.    (I was on as my 50 beastlord).  A lot of the mobs were
DB - Red to them and they made excellent experience and weren't really
too young to be there - worked out great.
