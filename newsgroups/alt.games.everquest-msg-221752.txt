Yes, the WMBS is 31dam/28dly, and 28 is the fastest delay a 2H
weapon can have and still get a good damage bonus.

At L55 the magic number ratio for the WMBS is (2*31+21)=83/28 or
2.96, while the CHoS would be at (2*13+10)=36/20 or 1.80 and the
RES would add less than half of that (no bonus, fewer attacks,
fewer double attacks).  On top of that your opponent does more
damage to you via riposte.  Now the MNR is an admittedly rough
estimate of damage, but it works fairly well for comparisons.
I'd sure like to see actual parses with test conditions (level
of character, exact level of each mob, weapon skill, buffs,
haste, & etc.) because Melduhr's claims don't match what I've
observed or claims by others who have parsed damage output.  It
is also worth noting that 2H damage bonus advantage increases
significantly between 55 and 65, for a 28 delay 2H it goes from
21 at L55 to 35 at L65 while any 1H goes from 10 to 13.
