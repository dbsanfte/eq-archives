On my rogue, I've used mine on skills I don't have the chance to use much.
Languages are pretty easy to max out, so I went and put points into stuff
like swimming, tradeskills, and the ever-useful Hand-To-Hand ability.  (Why
a rogue gets that is beyond me.  It maxes at 100, and there are no H2H
weapons for rogues that I've seen.)
