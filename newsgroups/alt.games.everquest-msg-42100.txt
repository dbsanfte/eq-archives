Might be missing a major point here. Could VI *afford* to host
Alakhazam's site? Maybe. I wouldn't know about their finanical
situation. But would they *WANT TO* host it? I think not. While they
don't go out of their way to surpress such sites, even if they could, VI
reps constantly refer to such information as "spoiler" information. One
of the many reasons they've cited for the institution of the TCC in SoL
is that it will take longer for people to do all the ground breaking
exploration, discovering of mobs and loot, etc. rather than have some
full group of 58+ wipe out every zone the first day and post everything
to spoiler sites. That's not a direct quote, but damn close. They want
some things to be discovered in game and be a mystery, IMHO, rather than
everything being a "walkthrough" with the guide you just downloaded from
blahblahblahEQ.com.  So, for that reason, I don't think they'd be
interested in hosting Alakhazam's site, for free or otherwise. If they
wanted you to have all that information free for the asking at your
fingertips (or mousetip) without even having to enter Norrath to get it,
it would be available at everquest.com
