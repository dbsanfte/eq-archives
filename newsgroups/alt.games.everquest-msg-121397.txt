Imagine our surprise when a PoG in PoG did that (no, he did NOT gate...I
don't think they CAN) and started summoning a few people across the zone.

That's when I learned that you can't even drag your OWN non-KOS corpse in
PoG (sounds like a bug).

CR wasn't too bad, though we had one person stuck under the world, but it
WAS certainly annoying.
