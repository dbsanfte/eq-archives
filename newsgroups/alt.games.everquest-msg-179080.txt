This was my 3rd favorite song, seemed very Christian, like something I =
haven't heard in a very long time.=20

I cannot say that I don't care cause I'm aware
Of everyone and everything they're everywhere

Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
You're right it ain't safe here
Start using your brain, your brain

The cautious hare cannot be seen as a coward
He's simply aware
(He constantly) knows what's going on
That the wheel of life turns on
It won't hold on

Silent creature, filthy teacher's
Spreading the disease, a release
A vanished kingdom falls

It goes on, on and on and again
It goes on, round and round
Oh I can't get it out of my head

Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain

Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back

We're the last descendants
In the line of valiant soldiers
We're mistreated angels
We are the blackbird nation, we're the chosen ones
We're the last descendants
We're the tribe of unsung glory
We are the fallen angels
Well the time is right you shall be on my (side)

I don't I don't I don't need anyone
Be with or be against me
I'm white I am chosen
There is not the slightest doubt at all
Not at all

In lower airs we're ground down by their ignorance

Hate will grow like a foul cancer
To find a foe seems to be the answer
Round and round it goes on and again oh
I can't get it out of my head

Wish I'd be a bird of prey
A pure and a blessed
A hawk who could ease the pain

Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back

Don't be a fool
Stop spinning around
(Spinning around)
Don't move it ain't safe here
They've stained holy grounds
Oh no

The hopeful he sadly admits there's no hero
No place to hide there is no shelter from the storm
The maddened crow will spread terror
But I know bitterly they will stumble
Find themselves smashed on the ground

Don't look back tell me
Is it where you belong
A place in the dark
A song without hope
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
Oh I wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait for an answer so far
Don't look back tell me
Is it where you (belong)
I will wait yes I will wait
Don't look back

It's you who has said there's no tomorrow
I don't know but who I am
I wouldn't sit back any longer
It's surely built in sadness
But the sadness surely will go by
So we will all know the answer
The answer's within, it's in your mind
