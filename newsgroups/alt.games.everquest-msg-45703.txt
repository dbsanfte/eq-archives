Actually, that doesn't give a complete picture of what's going on here.
Wolfform, instead of raising your faction 2 levels in most places like it used
to, lowers it 2 faction levels. I'm Ally in wolfform to Coldains and FV. And
Gore loves me. Hunting Mistmoore will do that. She's on the Ring of Scale
faction. You used to take hits to this if you fought in Permafrost, but they
removed that faction from those goblins when they added Gore to the DL.
(Actually, after people who hunted Perma came to DL and got splatted, then
complained) If you work your barbarian factions you can also wolfform easily
without fear of death. You only need high amiable in normal form to be able to
wolfform around friendly NPCs. As someone else said, the Gargs in OOT will give
Mistmoore faction because they're from the same spawn table. Welcome to Kunark
