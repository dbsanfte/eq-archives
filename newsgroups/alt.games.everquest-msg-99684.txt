It's true that 1-10 has been "oversimplified", but I don't think
it's accurate to say that about 11-30.

Note that according to the exp table shown in the link, it
takes *exactly* as much exp to hit 30 now (post-patch) as it
did before -- it takes exactly 21,950,100 exp points either way.

And while Verant has stated that they've accelerated the
exp process from 1-10, all they've done from 11-30 has been
to give bigger "dungeon" bonuses (and we have yet to know
how large, or small, the dungeon bonus is).  It's not as if they
reshaped the exp curves from 11-30.  In order to get *any*
faster progress from 11-30, you're actually going to have
to go dungeon-diving, which will help overcome the
problems you describe:

More dungeon-running means more "weapons, gear, etc",
it means more loot for affording spells, it probably
means more intense encounters (and thus faster skill-ups),
and it especially means more practice in the kind of
game skills that people need to learn in order to survive
at higher levels.
