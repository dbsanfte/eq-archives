A warrior can solo to 60 at least, if not to 65.  As long as there are 
exp mobs you can kill on less than half your HP, you are good to go; 
kill one, bandage up, kill another.  Get the AA that let you bandage 
higher than 50% and so much the better.

Now this does depend of course on what you mean by "reasonably well", 
but they seem to be roughly competitive with clerics for soloing...

Changing instruments about is Juggling, not "instrument twisting", which 
sounds like it would result in some pretty tangled strings on your lute.

No, by and large juggling isn't the mark of an average bard.  Usually 
you need no instrument at all, or one.  And if you need an instrument, 
you usually don't really need a weapon... in fact, by and large you 
could mark every weapon in the game as not usuable by bards and not hurt 
the class at all; weapons are just something bards do to keep busy when 
singing 5 songs and juggling a drum and lute aren't enough, but they 
really don't do much more to the mobs than an enchanter trying to swing 
a harmonica would.

Three songs and no juggling is the mark of an average bard, and I bet if 
you keep at the class you'll find yourself running 4 or even 5 and doing 
some light juggling as you get more used to things; these things do 
indeed come with practice, they aren't generally a matter of native 
talent alone.

Llyric, 57 bard, Morel-Thule
5 song twists and single slot juggling; good but not great bard
