You HAVE to be kidding me. You shouldn't be able to do anything,
except get on and play. Heck, if you kept getting killed you don't
have a right to kep your level even!

If you don't like the game why play it? What levels are those pray
tell? I can give you the name of a zone that you could level through,
if you wanted to play the game. Five years for how many levels?

You can't find food in Freeport? I keep going to Freeport FOR my Orc
Pickles. They are crunchy in the milk I buy. I am just too cheap to
buy other food, unless I pull the Picnics out of the bank, then I use
the good food.

I think I smell YAWK!
