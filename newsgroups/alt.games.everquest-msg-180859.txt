    There was a fair outcry, and it was because of misleading statements
more than anything else. For some time the devs had claimed they were
working on a raid system. Because at no point was it stated "we're working
on a raid system to be made part of the next expansion", it was assumed it
would be a free addition whenever they got it working. That assumption was,
of course, incorrect.
