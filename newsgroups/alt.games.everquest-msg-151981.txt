I have a lvl 53 bard.  In my experience the Wind and Brass instrument skills
were the toughest to get any skill points in.
Best method for wind that I found was to use a standard flute and sing the
invisibility song.  I really don't know if this makes a big difference but
that song requires the instrument to be in hand to play it.
Wind and Brass took a long time to get the skills over 200.  Best advice I
can give is to turn the song on, maybe jump in water while you're at it, hit
numlock, and walk away from the computer.
