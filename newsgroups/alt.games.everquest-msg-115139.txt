'Apparently' being the keyword. If someone has ever used a key to
operate the elevator I wouldn't mind hearing about it. I've heard a few
theories but none I've tried have worked. Including the Ulak thing that
Captain of the Guard drops.

 Yeah but that door is locked as well so getting to that point with no
Rogue is a bit pointless. It may be a shortcut for a raid that has a
rogue with them, but that's not what he was asking.
