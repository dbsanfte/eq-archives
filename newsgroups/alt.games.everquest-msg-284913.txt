Because the lithium just wasn't doing the job.

No, I mean the new meditation thing.  It was my opinion that this would 
be pretty meaningless for a normal exp group, as nobody sits down for 3 
minutes 30 seconds between pulls.

However, the consensus on Combine seems to be that its incredibly 
powerful, after all.

Apparantly several factors are at work:

1) time before you can start rest is based on whether -you- have engaged 
a mob, not whether your group has.  Sit out a pull and you're in Rest 
mode before you know it

2) the 3 minute portion of the setup is for OOM to FM.  Only need 33% of 
your bar back?  Thats just a minute.  Sit out one pull and you're 
probably thru resting before the next arrives.

3) Alternately, go thru a series of pulls, work your mana bar gradually 
down very low, then take a brief breather; 3:30 between pulls every 10th 
pull isn't too much to ask, even if you can't achieve it by simply 
skipping one pull.

4) A healer can be constantly in Rest mode, simply by avoiding healing 
during combat.  If your tank can survive each fight, wait for the kill, 
restore him to full health, repeat.  I'm not sure this last one works, 
something nags me about transfering your target's Rest timer to yours.

Something occured to me, which I haven't tried yet; what if I FD mid 
combat, get a heal, then stand back up and re-engage.  I sometimes group 
with a second Tank class simply because we try to keep to guild only 
groups and to include anyone who's LFG even if they aren't the optimal 
class for the group.  Again, I think Rest Timer transfer might be a 
problem with that angle.

At any rate, I didn't get to experiment with this at all yet, as the 
guild went to Hate to try and get some of the uber drops there (for some 
reason POH is currently dropping POP gear instead of the old school POH 
gear that was previously on the Combine server).  POH has a 5 minute 
timer in effect instead of the 60 second one, and we didn't see that 
kick in often at all.
