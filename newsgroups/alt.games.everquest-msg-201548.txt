Sure.  Remove the first line entirely.  When you're grouped, change the R to
a G.  When going to a raid, put it back.

On a related note, here's a really cool hotkey my honey's cleric uses (and I
think every cleric should use):

Assuming that MA is Billy, SA is Willy, and TA is Timmy:

/target Timmy
/target Willy
/target Billy
/rsay CH chain is targeted on %T

Hitting this key flips quickly through the three tanks, stopping at the MA -
unless the MA is dead, in which case it stops at the SA - unless the SA is
dead, in which case it stops at the TA.  Thus, it stops at the last person
who should be the target of the CH chain who is still alive.  If something
goes wrong (mob gets in a lucky flurry, whatever) and the MA goes down, one
tap of this key retargets without delay.  Yes, you have to rebuild it every
raid if the tankage changes.  It's worth the 30 seconds it takes, trust me.
