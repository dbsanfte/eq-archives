If you don't like it maybe you should just not visit the website hehe. I 
don't get paid, I don't get anything for it. I just keep it up in my 
spare time. If you want to enjoy annoyance free browsing on that website 
using a different browser is about the only way. Be immature and isult 
me all you want, but in the end it is something I have that YOU want 
(information on that website), if you don't want that 
information/trainers then dont' visit it.

:p
