Presumably this would just be how your client renders the NPC based on
their con towards *you* - that's the only way I can see it actually work
sensibly, so the troll PC would see the same NPC scowling on his
machine, while he's grinning inanely on your machine. I guess this would
have to change when an NPC actually aggros on something - otherwise it'd
be disconcerting to see those happy, smily guards mindlessly slaughter
some poor luckless individual, beaming from ear to ear while they slice
and dice.
