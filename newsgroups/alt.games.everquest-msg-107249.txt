I'll answer the last part first.  I plan to disable my account in a
month or two for an unknown length of time while I try some other games
that are coming out.  Also, I haven't found the Luclin around here for
under $39 so far.  (If you have a link to an online store that has the
price you mentioned, please post it.  I may get Luclin just to try for a
month or two.)

Now to answer the first part with a question of my own.   Are you saying
that if I log onto my account using a computer that has Luclin
installed, it will let me with my non-Luclin account into the Luclin
parts of the game?
