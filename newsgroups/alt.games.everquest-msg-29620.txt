My druid is lvl 20 now, and I had some of the same questions. One piece of
advice is make sure you have consolidated that level before doing anything
too dangerous. It really sucks to lose that lvl 19, and not be able to gate
back to your corpse.

Most people advise Lake of Ill Omen for lvl 19-20

Bind at the Windmill, so you don't have to make that journey through Firiona
Vie again. (there's some scary Terath.. er... Drachnids there). I found some
of the groups in LoIO can be dangerous and greedy, but you do get good
experience. If you get in a good group, it's great. I left there to do the
bread delivery quest, and now that that has been nerfed, I may go there
again.

Other things to do apart from levelling are;
The Testament of Vanear quest
Leatherfoot Raiders Cap quest (not sure if this is broken or not)
Screaming Mace quest

In Lake of Ill Omen, I was sometimes used as a healer, and sometimes as a
SoW and Skin buffer. Nukes were fairly rare, and used, if at all, to finish
a mob off. I have Careless Lightning memmed but don't use it too often.

How about "Snubnose", or "Adebisi"
