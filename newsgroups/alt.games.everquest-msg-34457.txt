Excellent post!

There's a lowbie DE in gfay on Tallon Zek last night.  Claims that he's
there to
befriend elves in order to fight the gnomes.  He wouldn't fight any elf.  He
just stood
there and let people kill him.  Of course he was bound in gfay, so he just
came back
again.  I think his name is Dinain.

I'm not sure what to make of him.
