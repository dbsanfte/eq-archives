Here is the situation from a Bard's  point of view.  It all depends on the
situation and person in the party and the only way to know is to ENSURE good
communication is happening.  A Bard can be anything to a minor degree so
requires group input on the desired role.  If there is no communication
happening, of course there will be arguements over the playing style.
Different people have different views... not a problem as long as the group
is aware of that.  Nobody should jump down a person's throat over it but
they should clear up the situation and then each person can go their
seperate way if they can't come to an agreement.  That's my 2 notes worth.
