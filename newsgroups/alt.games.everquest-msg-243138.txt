Aye, and there is actually a practical reason for generic_melee_007
to be trying to hit the mob from behind... It is my understanding that the 
*mob* doesn't get a dodge/parry check if you are attacking from the back 
arc, so consequently, said melee will have a higher dps there.

If I'm wrong about that, please, edjumacate me.  But it seems reasonable 
in theory, and generally matches my experience.  Still, yes, don't turn 
the freakin' mob. :)
