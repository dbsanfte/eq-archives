Ah, mr shitforbrains is back.

Let's see, shall we.

Oh gee, lots of on topic points there. "Pompous buffoon", yes, that
relates greatly to how guides should answer petitions.

Yet more on topic points. How did I miss it!

Your hammering away at the points hits new highs! You must be a
stellar debater!

The piece de resistance. Minus the accents. Here's where he makes the
idiotic belief that I give a shit what he thinks.

Consider yourself educated, fucknuts. You didn't have jack shit for on
topic points and you know it. Raw flamage != debate.

The reason I have so little respect for humanity is because of idiots
like this. Fuck off and die, you sorry piece of shit. You're not worth
anything more than that.

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
