That *is* insane. Last night I got two tunics on two turn ins. I'm
wearing one and I stuck the other in the bank for now. I tried
/auctioning it for eight gold (HEY! STOP LAUGHING! That's a LOT of money
right now!) but the only tell I got in response was from a necro asking
if he could equip it. Of course, INT casters can't, so no sale. I now
have almost all the non jewelry equipment slots filled.

Yep, I found the large scorpions, as you suggested, and even got the two
pincers and put them in the pack. Then, of course, when I got back into
town to the fortress, I totally forgot which NPC gave me the quest and
couldn't figure it out after questioning all the drill masters, so I
gave up and camped. *sigh*.

That Iksar regen is VERY nice at low levels. I can remember playing my
"soft skin" characters at the newbie levels and getting poisoned by the
spiders and dying after the fight while sitting down. (DOH!) Happened
last night, and with the poison on me, seated, my health bar doesn't
drop. The regen keeps up with it, if not slightly ahead. It's a big plus
in the noob levels alright.
