yeah but it wouldnt help ya . spoiler follows.















the tower with the magicians is more than one level . if you go over near
where the guards are standing you will see a wall hanging. click on it to
teleport up a level each time. on the top level clicking it takes you back
to the bottom level. the top level has the merchants with the researched
spells.
