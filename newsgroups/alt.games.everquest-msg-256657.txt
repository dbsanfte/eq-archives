so i just started a monk and i'm getting used to the whole "don't go over 14
pounds" thing.  but i noticed that 1 pound overwieght only makes your AC go
down 1 point, so an armor piece that puts you 3 pounds overwieght but gives
you 17 AC is still good, right?  so really you only need to worry about the
weight of things that don't counter their wieght with AC.  am i on the right
track here or totally off?
