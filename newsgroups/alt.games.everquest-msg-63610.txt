Best way is copy your entire EQ dir onto a couple cd roms you burn (if
you have a cd burner) take the cds to you dads, copy them into a new
dir, highlight them all and switch off "read only", play. EQ does not
install any stuff in the reg or anything so its very easy to just burn
your whole dir every so often and plop it in to avoid long patching.

Yes, that is the answer to both your questions.

If you absolutely can't burn the dir and will have to install the
cdroms manually and totally repatch onyour dads puter (yuck) I hope he
has a darn good connection to the internet. Then just copy all your
*.opt and *.ini  on to some floppies and stick them in the dir.
