    I still am - don't forget mini-D! :-)

    No, it means the guild in question has made a concious decision to not
require members to drop what they're doing to go to unplanned events. If the
guild has made this decision, knowing it will limit them from ever becoming
a power guild, then turning off /gu isn't a crime. Still is pretty
anti-social, but it's not violating the guild's charter. You don't need to
hear any general calls for aid - by turning off /gu, you've decided you
won't respond to ANYTHING that day.

    I didn't say it wasn't short-sighted. But it wouldn't annoy the guild to
the point of kicking you for it, given the decisions I outlined above.

    Jazz, turning off /gu is at a player's option. Presumably they KNOW that
they could miss out on all sorts of things by doing it. Having /gu turned
off and deciding that no matter what people say in /gu, you're not helping
are almost the same decision. IF your guild doesn't expect aid from anyone
on non-planned days, they cannot be upset that players make these decisions.
I don't think it would be wise to do, but it's certainly an option for
someone.

    And that's something that your guild, and the members in it, have to
accept - if you allow people to not come, then expect to get less
accomplished that isn't individual-oriented. I know guilds like this - they
started small, they're staying small. Some people join, get tired of "not
doing enough", and move on, others stay. The people who stay don't seem to
have an issue with not seeing the high-end content, or being as uber as they
can be. They play to chat and relax.

    No, the guild is relying on there being a critical mass of people who
care to get things done. If you don't have that, does it really matter if
everyone has /gu on or not? One of the reasons my buddy the rogue quit EQ
was Renux - he was at that stage of his epic. He'd log on, ask the guild
during prime time "Anyone want to help with Renux?" and after I and one or
two others offered aid and everyone else said "busy", he'd log to an alt.
Nobody in the guild cared to do those sorts of things more than whatever
they were doing themselves. Did it matter that those people that always said
"busy" had /gu on?

    *chuckle* /g Targrin is up in FoB, druid, fire up port to EJ! Only takes
one person in a six person group to say that. Again, if your guild is so
dysfunctional or uninterested in helping that you get groups of six people
who turn off /gu then you really have more to look at than making /gu a
requirement.

    Of course not, because you want to do the things your guild wants to do.
You also feel that having a guild tag carries responsibility. Many people
get guilded for lewt and chat, and even worse because being guilded is "the
thing to do". Remember all those nasty things you said about unguilded level
60 characters in our Mighty Strike conversation? How do you suppose someone
who is essentially a soloist could avoid having people look at them in that
light? That's right - get into a guild, ANY guild, then ignore the things
the guild wants to do unless it meshes with what you want to do. Guilds
exist for reasons other than killing shit in multi-group settings.
