This appears to be a new problem in some way especially with the boat and
have yet to find a solution.  As for the floating hit F10 a couple of times
and that will fix that problem which is know and been around awhile, the red
blob is a new on to me so have no idea although at times I will change
servers and get no names or information on my characters.  This apparently
stems from a eqgame problem for when I log out I almost always crash with
that error.  Basically, I suspect that with higher level graphics demands as
a result of SOL a lot of small problems have be magnified into large ones.
Given Verant's track record don't expect much to be done about any of them
and expect the blame to be placed, like most other problems in the game on
the players computers rather than Verant's programming where it really
belongs.  Still given the complexity of the game and the mass of code
involved in all its updates such problems must be expected.
