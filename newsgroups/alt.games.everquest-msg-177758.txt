When they announced the nerfs, it was to chanters, necros, mages and druids.

With Lightening Reflexes 5, Total Domination 3, ND3, and all the various
spell/focus effects (spell casting subtlelty, increased channeling etc), not
to mention over 5000HP, the risk to chanters is not enough for the reward it
offers.  Heck, find a snarable mob and the risk is almost minimal.

Last weekend I was exping my monk and shaman, and botting a chanter (who
doesn't have all the above mentioned AA skills either) on my laptop (clumsy
keyboard, no mouse etc).

As MA and slower I was still able to keep a charmed pet safely, for the
entire night.

Chanter didn't die once, infact nobody died because of the (hasted) pet,
even once.

There were multi pulls, charm breaks on double pulls etc, but this hasted
560 hitting pet caused no trouble.  Where was the great risk in charming?
That was with a BOT chanter.. totlly forgeting the fact I never leveled a
chanter past 54, and know next to nothing about the class.

I made over 6 aa's that night (no charm-pet would have been maybe 2 levels,
max) and imo it was 99% risk free

Who else can get an AA inside 15 minutes?  Who can get 1 inside 30 mins
