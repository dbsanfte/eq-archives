We both agree that kids are smart.  I say that we need to provide them with
the tools to understand (the vocabulary to label concepts, the math by which
to model scientific and physical concepts, the experience in working through
complex ideas and forging new neural pathways, etc...)  You then go ahead
and give examples of how you and your kids prove the theory.  I think you
disagreed with me too soon.  ^_^;;

Now, that being said... everyone, young and adult learn differntly.  I'm
trying to study calc in my off time (since I don't have time to acutally go
to college... yes, that's right, folks, you've been arguing with someone who
isn't even smart enough to make it to college.  Now you know why I'm not so
bright), but I can't find a text that goes into enough detail.  They all
just show the equations, but no derivations ;_;  All I've got for proofs are
the notes I took in High School.

Yes, I think there is.

It probably doesn't have derivations, either ;_;

We'll just say that my opinion on that was formed by my aunt, who is a
teacher.  She also pretty much led the effort to kill outcome based
education and whole language in her school.  She's only a member of the
teacher's union because AZ requires it.  I think that law is next on her
crosshairs.
