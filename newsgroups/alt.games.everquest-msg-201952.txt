>>Yes, all the sound files in my EQ directory are MP3's now, and i have POP

want in-game.<<

Hmmm... I still see tons of XMI files in my EQ directory. I thought they
only added MP3s to the POP zones (and entry music). but left all the other
zone music as midis.

I turned off music ages ago as well. I'd be pleased if they could have an
option to play the atmosphere music without the battle crap.
