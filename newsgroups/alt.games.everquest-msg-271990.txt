I do have to agree with Patrick here.  I recall that this very thing
happened.   When reading about the quest during Beta.  If I recall, the key
was to clear the zone prior to taking on the final challenge.  I have not
done this, so I cannot truly say, but that was what I remember reading.

I do hope that helps.

Fin and others.
