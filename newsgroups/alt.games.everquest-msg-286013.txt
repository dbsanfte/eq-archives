I'm on the border between the hackers and those offended by the practice.  I
really like the challenge of reverse-engineering things.  I really HATE boring
parts of games.  I tend to support automating anything that can be done by a
human - people have better things to do.  

I won't do things outside the rules of the game, which a normal player just
can't do.  Safe spots, under-world killing, etc. are beyond what I consider
ethical.  However, I don't judge people who DO think it's ok, as long as
they're not directly affecting others' experience.  Indirect effects
(inflation, mob scarcity, etc.) are the fault of the game, not the players or
hackers.

How do you find a way around being banned?  Or are your characters so
valueless due to the cheats that you consider it cost-less to get a new
account?

Seems like an honest, useful opinion to me.  You don't have to agree, but I
don't see how the word "leech" adds anything.

Huh?  This has nothing to do with money.  Timesinks are the root of all evil.
