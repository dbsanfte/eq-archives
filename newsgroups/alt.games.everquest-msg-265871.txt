I have friends that are gay. I, my wife and our kids love them dearly. 
When my family goes on vacation they watch our house, they have watched 
my 2 sons and daughter on countless occasions when the miss's and I go 
out. One is the Godfather of our youngest son.

They know I do not support Gay Marriage and can argue with them that I 
feel it is a "choice" not a "genetic" behavior. We have argued this into 
the night on many occasions but in the end we just agree to dis-agree, 
give hugs and kisses around, and say good-night.

On the other hand, and maybe it's a contradiction, but I do believe any 
couple deserves recognition ( civil unions ) and full benefits and 
decision making for each other. They on the other hand abhor behavior 
like that displayed in many gay pride events, they dont flaunt what they 
beleive.
