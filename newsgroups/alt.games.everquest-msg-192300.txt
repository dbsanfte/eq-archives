Spell research is the devil!

It's really a pain in the ass to research your own spells, especially 
with the research cap being the way it is.  In general, if you have a low 
skill at a tradeskill (which your research skill would be capped around 
what, 90?), you'll still fail quite a bit on trivial items.  Example: I 
was making picnic baskets for my baker to make misty thicket picnics, so 
tailoring skill was around 76, which is where the picnic baskets trivial 
in tailoring.  Didn't think I'd need to raise past that since, hey, 
they're trivial, right?  Long story short: I was getting about a 60% 
success rate on a trivial item.  Raised my tailoring to 115 or so 
(anywhere over 110ish seems to be where you get proficient at making 
things that are close to trivial) and now I fail maybe twice on a set of 
20 combines.

Moral of the story: keep practicing research, but don't expect to 
actually succeed until you're in your 40s or so.  Until then, if the 
components are hard to come by, or you really really need the spell, find 
a friend with higher research to do the combine for you.  My enchanter is 
somewhat proficient with his research in the 120s.
