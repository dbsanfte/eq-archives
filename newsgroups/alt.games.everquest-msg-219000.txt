I think we all understand your viewpoint. I can't speak for the others, 
but for myself, I think your viewpoint inevitably takes us to a much 
worse place.

Freedom is a responsibility, and therefore is its own cage.

I fully support your right to decide to post inflammatory things here... 
even though I think they were foolish and arrogant. Your duty to 
tolerate foolishness in others is paid back in full when you realize 
they are affording you the same leeway.

So you are. But you have (thankfully!) stopped short of bringing 
consequences against them because they failed your test. Merely 
suggesting it is fair game...even suggesting it in an inflammatory turn 
of phrase which didn't win you many friends; nobodies hauling you in for 
judgement.
