As far as I'm aware, no hard data is to be found about this, and
there's never been any posted here, as I recall.  The consensus seems
to be that any XP a lvl 70 gets in a lvl 20 Shroud will be negligible.
I've seen articles that say you ARE getting XP, but when the XP earned
as a lvl 20 is added to your lvl 70 XP bar upon de-Shrouding, it just
doesn't register. 

From personal experience, when I drop into Shroud form to group with
my friends' lower-level characters, I've never noticed any real
difference in XP, be it AA XP or regular XP.

The Shrouds themselves unlock pretty quickly though, at lvl 20, and
I've unlocked the Evil Eye Psion Shroud in an evening, playing the lvl
20 Shroud.
