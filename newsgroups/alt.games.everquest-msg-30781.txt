Depends on the anonomizer...

"Comments: Please report problems with this automated remailing service to 
<squirrel-admin@echelon.alias.net>. The message sender's identity is 
unknown, unlogged, and not replyable."

Looks like a sure-as-hell spam magnet.

Depending on your newsreader (I use XNews, best damn news client EVER, 
especially if you are familiar with regular expressions (not hard, check 
them out) http://xnews.3dnews.net) you can filter out messages that have 
come through this server. In this instance, the following line would do the 
job nicely:

[^alt\.games\.everquest$]
    % generated by Xnews on Wed 08 Aug 2001 11:54:57p
    Score:: -9999

Try XNews, and you can make a LOT of Spam go away as well. I can post some 
of my filter sets if there is any interest. I promise you that XNews will 
beat the *crap* out of ANY newsreader available, for any platform.
