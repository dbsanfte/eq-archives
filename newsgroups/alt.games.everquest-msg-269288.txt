A Call out to any like minded players of the Befallen server.

I come from a gaming guild that has been around for almost 3 years now. We 
started in Diablo II and have branched succesfully into SWG (Starsider 
server) and most recently World Of Warcraft. As I choose Everquest 2 for my 
gaming, I am calling all Mature, friendly FREEPORT OR QUENYOS  based players 
to join one of the most tightknit Gaming groups online.

Requirements:

Maturity- This doesnt necessarily reflect your age, however I do ask that 
you be old enough to respect others freedom and ability to do their own 
thing. We will NOT discriminate because as the average age in the guild is 
about 24.

Honor- As our name implies, we will NEVER run a scam operation, anyone found 
in violation of this rule will unfortunately loose membership. We look to 
bring Honor to the game which is a virtue which is expected to be carried 
with you in guild affairs.

Level / Alignment- My personal character is Freeport based, so I will be 
looking for at least one member to help me manage the Quenyos sector, this 
member, to be chosen by me, will be automatically promoted to the rank of co 
leader. I offer this because I cannot start this alone, and MUST find a 
totally trustworthy player to coordinate my efforts. Level is not an issue, 
from Newbie to Veteran, you are all welcome to share information or recieve 
it because that as well is an extremely important part of strengthening our 
guild. Knowlege is power.

Voice Chat- We will be running either a Teamspeak or Ventrilo server to be 
decided on by the members I recruit. It will be dedicated as soon as we 
decide which route we want to take. While not required, it is STRONGLY 
recommended as it is an integral part of  gaming IMHO.

Sound like something you are interested in? You can contact SEYMOUR in game 
OR go to our website, www.guardiansofhonor.com and post in the OFF-TOPIC 
forum until I get the EQ2 forum set up. Just put in the subject line ATTN: 
SEYMOUR or somethin about Everquest and we can talk.


Behavior: As a member of GoH you represent us. Acting badly in public 
effects our reputation negatively. Fooling around in private is no big deal, 
but when you begin to annoy other members it becomes a problem.
FYI:Our guild does not strive to be the largest guild/community but rather a 
close knit friendly environment where everyone is familiar with each other.
