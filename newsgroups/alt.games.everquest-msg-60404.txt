Nope, its not true. For example, your hp are basically upgraded due to
your stamina or whatever but it only is as far as they see it because
they have a bunch of stamina gear on (say like a suit of crustacean
plate) When they die, and are down to the original stamina, they have
the hit points they'd have even if they dinged naked because that hp
will be a constant for their level and stamina and race or whatver (if
that does anything) when naked.

Otherwise when my 55 level druid died and was full mana, its mana
would not shrink to half when it looted its corpse since I certainly
always had all my equipment on when leveling.
