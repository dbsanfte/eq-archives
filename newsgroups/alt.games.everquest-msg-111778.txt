My cleric was riding the Maiden's Voyage to Kunark about a year ago.
I went up high on the prow (it's a *big* boat) to enjoy the view, and
got scraped off by the very top of what I think was one of the spiroc
towers.  I was *waayyy* up there.  I was able to fire off Divine Aura
and jump down, found my way to Ogre Island, got on the Belly
(carefully, since I'm a high elf) and promptly went LD.  When I came
back, I was in Oasis, so I gated to BB and started the whole process
again...
