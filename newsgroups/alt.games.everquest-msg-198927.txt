You should be OK, faction wise, with the dorfs. Even my iksar monk
isn't KOS to them. You'll have to kill some orcs inside to get enough
faction to deal with the vendors. 

One thing to watch out for is that a group of orcs (Avengers?) will
occasionally spawn when someone kills the chief inside the fort. Those
see invis and will probably outrun SoW at your lvl. Stay well away
from them if you see a gang of 4 orcs running around outside the fort.
