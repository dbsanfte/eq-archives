I would have doubts about me being able to survive that.  Less than uber 
gear, no torpor or even mini torpor.  Are the mobs rootable?

They are dropped pretty fast, well, that or the trial fails, so, under 30 
seconds of 3 beating on you, then another under 30 of two, then another 
under 30 of 1.  I don't recall what they hit for off hand.  If I could 
survive the full wave, then gimp CH back up, it could work.

I might have to try this just to see.  Damn you Martin, I passed the trial 
already.  The good thing is, if I die, I lose all of 4% or so of xp without 
a rez, having successfully tested that last night by looting my corpse 
before the rez.  Doh!
