Reminds me of the time I was DMing a D&D game & suckered a big tough
Paladin into putting on some bunny slippers. Pink of course... They
DID function as elven boots, but hey had a serious reaction modifier
against him... And they were cursed not to come off :) All those
monsters just couldn't keep a straight face when they saw the Big Bad
pally come at them in Pink Bunny Slippers! 

He finally got a remove curse cast... But I had a lot of fun with it.
:)
