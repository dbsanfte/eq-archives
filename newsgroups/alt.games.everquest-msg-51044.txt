ATK...will that affect hand to hand as well as bows...with a name like
dead aim and a spell for rangers I'd like to see this as a really tough
but bow only spell.

Both these two make me ask a question...if I stat buffing a groupmates pet
or healing it...does it actually do anything....I've done it on a few
occasions when I was low level (12 or so) and my buffs were reasonably
unique, and always been thanked by the pet owners who obviously thought
they did something.....but does it...
