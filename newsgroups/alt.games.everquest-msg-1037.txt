Equal faction bump.

And it doesn't get divided "by group", everyone who takes a whack at
the monster gets faction when it dies (whether they're in the group that
did the most damage to it or not), and conversely if you're in a group
that kills a factioned mob but you never took a swing at it or cast
a spell affecting the kill, you won't get any faction message.
