It's great to see that Verant continues to take measures to remove
some of the tedium aspects of the game (and especially nice to see it
in tailoring, of course :)

Now, if only it were a bit easier to get one's hands on Viscous Mana.
I spent several hours over the past three days wandering around
looking for someone who would make some for me. I was supplying the
vials and pearls, and willing to pay per cast as well (200 mana per
makes this a real pita for enchanters).

Finally a kind soul in NK took pity on me and made 40 of them. I was
dismayed at how fast I was able to burn through all 40.

I'm giving serious consideration to power leveling an enchanter of my
own so that I can make these things.
