You can buy a worthwhile DS potion for only 100pp?  I seem to recall
them costing 3 or 4 times that.

You forgot promise to play the tiny violins for him because he gets
in trouble once every 10 kills (assuming he's incompetent) of mobs
that are much tougher than any melee his level can dream of soloing.
You forgot to ask him why he isn't wearing HP gear and using SoW
potions (assuming he can't cast SoW himself) to preserve his KEI.
While you did mention Gate, which will save him from situations that
most hybrids cannot survive, you forgot to suggest that he Root the
mob and back off to med so he can kill it, why run when you can win?
