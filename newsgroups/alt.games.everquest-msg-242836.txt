When I play one of my melee class chars, I keep a supply of level
appropriate gems on me to give to the cleric for buffs.  When I play my
cleric, I make it known that I will only keep symbols on the MT, Chanter and
myself.  I also ask to be reimbursed at time of split.  If I am with friends
or guildmates, I don't worry about it.  I never bothered when my cleric was
in his 20s, though, because the gems were so cheap.  After that, the price
of keeping symbol up meant that I rarely made back my costs on split, so I
asked for payment or components.  Very few ever objected, and those that did
ended up not being grouped with me.  One wizard started bitching during an
LDoN and got really nasty about it.  He had a habit of over-nuking and
wanted a symbol to up his HPs and refused to accept that it was costing me
anything.  I said no, he overnuked, he died when my heal landed just a bit
too late.  Then, because he was bound in Nexus (iirc) he was a good 5 zones
away from our MM run, he demanded a rez.  I loaded up Reconstitution.  Too
bad he didn't see it was a 10pct res.  Oops!  Now, don't piss me off and
don't try and tell me what I need to do when you cannot control your own
aggro.
