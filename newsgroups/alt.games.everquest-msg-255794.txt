I tried out Horizons this weekend for the first time. I'm hopelessly
smitten and I haven't gotten past the character creation. I can be a
friggin' pixie!  (yah, ok, they call 'em dryads, but pixie is what we
called things with butterfly wings in my day)

Any game that lets me a be a pixie deserves some points.

That, and...get this...my husband is actually moderately pleased with the
cat people in that game. I almost passed out on shock.  He's a little
annoyed at how the males get all fat in the tummy when they breath in (no
other male seems to do that), but otherwise he's happy.

And of course the dragons are utterly adorable. Especially when they jump.
^_^

We just have to see if we weather actually playing the game.  It's aniche
market for certain, what with all the crafting.
