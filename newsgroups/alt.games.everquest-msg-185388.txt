I'd use the lv 44 one, lasts longer, bigger radius, can lock with color
flux or shift if you get good timing.  I don't always keep it memed
though.

> 2: Stun (Color Flux � 4th level 4 second AoE stun)

actually about 3 seconds.

I usually keep this or shift memed.  I'm finding in many places flux
doesn't have the range to hit things, and I waste it.  The 1 sec casting
time is nice though.  Of course if I'm up against unstunables I toss it
for something else.

I prefer Immobilize, faster casting can save your life.  I switch to
root if I'm running out of mana.  again I keep this memed at all times
unless I'm fighting unrootable mobs exclusively.

Um.  That's a lot of mezing, I usually keep one or two at most, Dazzle,
Enthrall, and/or Entrance depending on situation.  I find little use for
the AE mez.  Enchanters have a lot of debate about this one, I can see
it's use in PoP now though, I'm from the days of not being able to
overwrite mezes with better ones, so it's just the way I learned.

> 7: Slow / Debuff (see note 1)  

I don't like slowing, I like to group with shaman :)  I'll usually dot
or nuke before debuffing except on mobs that last a really long time.

> 8: Swap (see note 2)

I usually keep berzerker in my swap slot.

I also usually keep charm up, even if my party doesn't want me to keep
something permacharmed I like it for those emergency situations.  I will
used to keep it up with an animation, I'd let my animation tank an add
until dead then charm if things got hary.  Can't do that anymore since
mobs won't attack pets if there's anyone else in reach.

You won't get a consensus on enchanter line ups.  Every situation has
it's useful spells and not useful spells.  Something may work for one
Enchanter used to doing somehting one way and not for another.  I
constantly change my spell line up even in the same situation to try to
get a more efficient line up.

Tash is god.  So you don't need it?  Well if you have any other casters
in the group (besides a cleric) you should tash.  It will help them land
nukes (or larger damage on them), debuffs, etc.  I always tash - it's
the inverse of haste for the fighters.

I just picked up a shissar nullifier staff though so I don't have to
devote a slot to it anymore, and I must say dropping that one slot + the
faster ability to tash has really upped my efficiency.  I'd drop just
about anything for this staff at this point.

Theft of thought always goes up for me anytime theres a remote
possibility of getting casting mobs, I really start nuking then, there's
nothing esle usefull to do when I have that much mana.   I also have
tanks regularly asking for Boon or Tricksters, I used to love it, but
now I hate it for requiring a devoted slot.  - Imagine having to keep
haste memed and only being able to haste 1 & 1/2 tanks.  Yuck.

Memblur sucks.  See my other post in this thread about it.  Reoccurring
Amnesia actually works, but how would you like to loose xp for your mob
because it forgot anyone was fighting it just as the druid/shaman/necro
dot kills it?  or forget that the tank has been beating on it, yet
remember that the cleric was healing.

Resisted though, I agree you need at least one if you are fighting
stunnable mobs.  - On an interesting note about this I found out last
week that some unmezable mobs are actually stunable - specifically
shimmering rockfiends in the grey.

I find it doesn't last long enough for anything, I use entrance (I think
that's the one) the first upgrade, it gives me enough time to gain my
composure, deal with adds etc.

I agree the recast time sucks.  I like the extra length, but it's a
trade off, not sure it's worth it either.

If you've got a wizard or druid it will help them do more damage. If you
are fighting casters it will help make sure they don't resist that stun
trying to stop thier gate or CH.  etc. etc.

Play in PoP sometime.  If you don't single pull your tank has a good
chance of dying before you can get dazzle off, especially with a
*single* resist or tanks attacking the wrong mob (still happens to me
all the freeking time), guess who's next?  You or the Cleric.  Happened
to me yesterday on a 2 pull in PoN on Nettling Wraiths.  Tank went for
the wrong mob, he was dead before Dazzle landed on the 2nd one
(considering dazzle might be what got us killed vs using the 34 one
since I could have recast it sooner, but that's why I'm always
experimenting trying to find out what works best).  We only had 2 2
pulls before that and the only reason we lived is I managed to dazzle
the 2nd mobs *before* they got back to the group, without any resist.
