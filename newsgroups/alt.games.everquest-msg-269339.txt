Makes you feel sorry for the poor guy, having to make due with such a 
crappy system...

To answer the question however, I have a Athlon XP 3200+ with 1GB of dual 
channel PC3200, and a 9800 Pro 128MB video card.  It runs quite decently on 
that with the default graphics settings.  There are times when I get lag, 
but it's not bad, and not often.
