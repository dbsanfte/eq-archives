    That never gets you to number one. Unless you're actually DOING the
encounters, and not just blowing them, you won't be able to pass and in many
cases you'll end up further behind (two can grief).

    Lots of PoP spawns can be blown without exploit. You can blow all the
HoH trials (access to Mith Marr) just by saying "I am ready", you can blow
the Carprin Deatharn encounter (access to Bertox) by killing the mobs from
the first part out of order, you can blow the Manaetic Behemoth (access to
Tactics, and the Zeks) by pulling it outside the room it spawns in (it warps
beneath the world and despawns).

    The only guild to ever be disbanded by a GM on Quellious was Dragons of
Asia, an almost-all Asian guild. Their exploits in training others were
legendary. One European ex-member once posted a screenshot of a dispute in
Fear, where the DoA guildleader said two words to his guild: "Move them."
Apparently the train that followed that command was epic. The GM's on
Quellious dealt with it in a very simple way: they asked both sides for
their story. If one side couldn't tell their story because of language (or a
feigned lack of English), they lost out.
