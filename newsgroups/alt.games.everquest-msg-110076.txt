Perhaps a new skill is in order: sailing.  Then we could use the
Luclin Spires, buy a port, rent a boat, or take the existing boats.  

Perhaps even a boat-building skill so the would be sailors would have
a place to get a bigger or faster boat.  A somewhat more limited
status symbol than a horse.

The advantage of player rented boats is they can take off NOW and go
anywhere.
