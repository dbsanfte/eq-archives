2 good groups should be enough to kill   JUST the General. Problem is, if
you don't get him solo, his friends are as tuff as he is. 3 or 4 of these
mobs can get the best of you once in awhile. Even for a bunch of 60s. When
mobs are hitting for 240, even 4500 HP goes fairly quick. I have helped kill
those mobs several times and someone almost always manages to die to em.
Usually the poor chanter who tried to mez one. :(
