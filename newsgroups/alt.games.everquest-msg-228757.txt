I find this to be unlikely . If a parent company goes belly up the assets
are all sold off . It is just the liabilities that are never seen again.
This would seem to indicate that no real value was held by the dead rpg
company.

For instance bankrupt airlines sell their jets and their terminals to other
airlines. The good employees can usually find other jobs in the industry
somewhere. There are many buisnesses that change how they operate a bit and
change the flag out front , but nothing much else changes at all.
