Hmmm, I sympathize and empathize with you and agree with all of what you
say, except for your last paragraph, it smacks too much of envy, which is
the twinks' response to any criticism. I get a bit jealous too, I must
admit, but generally I don't care. I play nice with chat and buffs and heals
and sows and ports and mana enhancers from any of my many
non-explicitly-twinked characters and I get enough gifts from people,
without ever begging, to supplement what I can get for myself and to keep me
in a reasonable state to get me through life. I sometimes refuse gifts, I
always try and give something in return (you can pick up some great flowers
cheap in Kunark, to hand out, and there's always a loaf of bread or some
wine), hehe, call it prostitution if you like. I've managed to get chars to
42, 36, 30, 26, 3 x 24, 4 x 22, 3 x 21 and 18 without feeling the need to
pass on stuff from one to the next and I know that if I grouped more and/or
guilded that I could do even better, that I am not by any means an expert on
anything and that I am probably missing a lot by not taking my characters
any further but it is great fun. I just feel sorry for the people who find
it necessary to pass on overkill gear to their alts just to get them thru
life quicker, especially when they pass it on from one class to a different
one, they miss out on so much. Hell, its not as if we all have to fight
spiderlings to survive, or even use the same approach to killing them, there
is enough variety of char and mob and zone out there.
