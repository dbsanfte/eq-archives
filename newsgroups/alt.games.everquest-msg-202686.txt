I'm all for the KEI nerf.  I'm for anything that reinforces grouping.

I'm also for nerfing the damn PoK books.  Sure, sure, I use them just like everyone else.
But without them the game was a lot more interesting.  It forced you to consider your
actions, your travel path, your potential encounters, etc.  Without the books EC and WK
might actually see some action again.
