I've never seen serious situation in which there is never a need for a healer
from time to time.  Situations in which a healer isn't needed often, and certainly
in which a cleric is not needed to serve as the healer.. but not at all?  Only
if what you mean is "because we aren't going to get hurt" and "I have a cleric
on speed dial that will come res us after"

You keep agreeing with me and making it sound like an arguement.  Shaman,
a joke as far as healers go if they for some reason insist on doing nothing but
heal (maybe they listened to the "med and heal, med and heal" mantra you'll
hear certain people chanting) are in fact excellent healers when they use their
slow and regen abilities to make the damage manageable.

I'm not argueing that shaman aren't good healers, I'm argueing that -bards- aren't.
Bards can do all that "manageable" stuff too, if their powers aren't needed
for one of the other half a dozen other swiss army knife functions... but
when someone is about to die despite that, what can they do?  Take a
screenshot would be about it.  Partnered with a healer, even one as pathetic
as say a paladin or even a necro or ranger, they could probably run all
three of us "real" healer classes out of a job.  That doesn't mean that they
-are- healers.  Any logic that suggests they are would also make
wizzards into healers, on the theory that since they can root a mob and
kill it without ever taking damage, they "heal" by not getting hurt.
