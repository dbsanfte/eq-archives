While it would certainly be wise to have a lurker in this group, it
would hardly give an accurate picture of the general population of the
game. If the number of malcontents and griefers in this group were
proportionally represented in-game, a fair number of the rest of us
would have run screaming into the void a long time ago.

The main lessons VI could take away from this group are:

(1) There will always be a contingent of people who hate you for
having the audacity to provide something they enjoy.

(2) They're doing the right thing to keep a tight reign on some
players in the game.
