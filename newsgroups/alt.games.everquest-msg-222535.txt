MMORPG are completely different to stand alone games like Need for Speed
which have a set amount of content and no social aspect. Predominantly the
content of an MMORPG is the people in the game, not zone X and mob X who
drops loot Z. Items are just pixel representations of database entries and
nothing more. It is your own sense of competitiveness that drives you to try
to put a measure on the game and your status within. At the end of the day
if we both play 100 hours, our experiences will be markedly different but
any measure on who has done the "most" in that time is relative and
artificial.
