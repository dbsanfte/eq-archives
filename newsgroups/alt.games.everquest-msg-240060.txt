    When I first got here, my very first or second post was insulted by Bizbee. 
I don't exactly remember the details, but I think he was criticizing my pompous
voice, or some such.  I thought the reaction was overly harsh.  I thought about
replying in kind.  Then I remember that I was newbie in an established
community, and I let it go.  It took a while, but I became a established member
also.  I have no doubt that if I made some stupid remark now, he would comment
on it.  But he would right for doing so.

   Like I've said, I'm rooting for you guys.  But understand that the method of
your arrival is more difficult than the process that most newsgroup newbs go
through.  Usually, they come one at time, and are corrected, gently or
otherwise, when they don't quite grasp how we operate.  Some, maybe most, leave
after calling us a bunch of assholes.  Some put their pride away, shut the fuck
up when they are corrected (sometimes in an insulting way) and after a while
become established members of the community themselves.  This is different.  We
are getting a whole group of you, and several of you are probably established
members from where you come.  I went to your forum, looked it over, and
subscribed so I would know more about what your possible position might be.  And
I think that actual set up is contributing to the problems.  From your
perspective, you are still where you always posted from, and then this newsgroup
suddenly shows up as one of your forums.  Sure, it's clearly marked that this is
not your content, but we do seem like we came into your house, rather than the
other way around.

   And yes, this might put some of us on the defensive.  Some might be more
inclined to smack you down, more harshly that circumstances would otherwise
dictate.  And some of you might be more apt to defend "your" turf than you might
be if you had come to the newsgroup singularly in a more conventional fashion. 
I don't see an easy resolution to this situation.  

   The response you posted above is the best track, I think.  If someone insults
you for something, let it go.  You don't have to reply.  You don't make it
easier when you do.  And you don't seem like winners even if you do manage to be
more insulting than the a.g.e. poster (I'm using the all inclusive "you" hear,
you understand).  I also know that it is against human nature to do this, and
probably won't happen.  Yes, there will be conflict, and no, we aren't going to
back down or give the EM posters special consideration because of where they
come from.

   I have no doubt that many people here will end up killfiling the entire EM
domain, as Bizbee is thinking of doing.  And yeah, some of you guys do make
doing that seem attractive.
