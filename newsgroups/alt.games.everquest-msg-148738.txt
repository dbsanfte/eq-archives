Heh.  Guess I'll add mine in too then.

I recently tried a 17" LCD display.  For most applications it is great, it
is bright, it is crisp, it has no geometry issues, it takes up little desk
space, it is light.  For games with fast moving objects, it is quite
annoying.  The fast moving objects tend to smear along their trajectory.
It's not very bad, and you do get used to it, but it is quite noticable.
For playing Everquest, I think it would work great, but I have not tried it.
