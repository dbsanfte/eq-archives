Plugging a 55 warrior with a FBSS into copeland with these weapons gets:
Defiance Primary/Centi Secondary = 1104 Damage Per Minute
Defiance Primary/Jagged Blade Secondary = 1102 DPM

Basically no difference...the centi looks nicer, and gives slightly more
hp, but the jagged blade gives ac and MR, which, IMO are the better things
to have. After all, 1 hp is enough if you never get hit.

The lammy primary is the same damage as the defiance, of course. The AC on
the defiance is FAR more useful however. 10 raw ac translates into like 35
points on your listing.
