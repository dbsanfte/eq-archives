 It's not 100% false. There are numerous mobs we've died to over and
over again until we get the strategy right. And when we finally get it
right we find out that nobody does it the same way as us. As an example,
look at the recent thread about IV. There's more than one way to kill a
mob and no strategy that can't be come up with if you keep trying and
actually learn from your mistakes. 

 To say only the first guilds that do things are the only ones who could
come up with a strategy is beyond naive. If they could do it there's
nothing to stop anyone else. It's just that too many people are into
instant gratification these days and consider dying more than 2 times
before winning as unacceptable.

 I'd be curious to hear how many times they actually tried figuring out
a strategy for themselves.
