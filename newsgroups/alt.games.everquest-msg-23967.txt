The overthere would be pitiful for exp but the dreadlands is very good exp
and you can always find people looking for a group. at the FV zone in dreads
there are some ruins with undead spawns, good for cleric warrior combo and
decent exp, wanderers around there to kill whilst waiting for spawns, but
watch for wraithbone champion, he is hard
