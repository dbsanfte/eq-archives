Well, seeing as how you just said what I was thinking reading that 
paragraph... :)  I mean, the whole point of dying is to, well okay, the 
whole point of dying for those NOT intent on making people color blind 
(there are some evil, evil minds out there, folks) is to inject a little

:P  Although come to think of it, with a barbarian and some fiddling, 
you could almost make it look like a school girl uniform...
