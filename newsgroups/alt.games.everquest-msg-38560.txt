Well, it's just 360'000 other subscribers who, like you, want Phat Lewt
and 31337 d00deZ monez plat (geez, skip at least the language). Face it:
*every* last one of the real good items is camped badly. I fyou want
a bit of money, you could join a giant group somewhere .. at your level,
the giants in FM are not bad. Their occasional loot sells for 11 up to 54
pp, and they occasionally drop up to 4 plat .. played over hours, you
still get exp and you can amass a few hundred plat. Or you can spend
200 hours in tower of kurns, waiting for a Jester to spawn with an IBC.
Good luck with that.
