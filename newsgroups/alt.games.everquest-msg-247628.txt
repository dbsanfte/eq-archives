Keep in mind that House had to make his comments accessible to the layperson
(for that matter, so did the author).  While John Q. Public may have never
played a MMOG in his life, by this time most everyone has downloaded
something.  When I help out non-computer literate folks with their computer
related issues, I use terminology that they're probably familiar with.
"Download" is an easy term to use ... what it means to most folks is "you
get something from a computer".

This section is most telling:

"Some of the add-ons will be items normally earned by long hours of play;
novice players could pay to equip themselves with the same gear as more
experienced competitors."

That's not talking about an expansion pack, or even parts of an expansion
pack.  That's talking about items, possibly plat as well.  The bit about
"novice players" equipping themselves as well as "experienced veterans"
indicates to me that he's not talking about pieces/parts of an expansion
(like just getting frogloks from LoY), but specific in-game equipment.

Also to note is the fact that EBaying was the inspiration.  You don't have
to get expansions from Ebay.

What you're doing, frankly, is picking nits with semantics.  I'll say it
again ... even assuming that House's original intention is to work solely
with consoles, do you really think it will stop there?

I, for one, am not so naive.
