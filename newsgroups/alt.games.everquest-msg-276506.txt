If all you doomsayers would read the whole text...

Here is the part you left out:

"We are changing many of the all-or-nothing immune flags so they mitigate 
the effect instead.  We want you to use your abilities on most NPCs, but 
where we feel the ability might be problematic the ability will have a 
lesser effect."

So, it would appear, with the exception of rare mobs that will be 
actually immune, the various agro generating spells will still be quite 
usable for generating agro, but will have their other effects, such as 
stun, snare, etc. reduced on those mobs.  For Paladins, this sounds 
great, for SKs, who often use a DoT/snare which used to not stick at all, 
it could be a problem in cases where they want agro, but do not want to 
damage a mob to keep it from summoning while kiting it.
