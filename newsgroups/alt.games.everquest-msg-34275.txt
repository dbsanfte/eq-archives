I played EQ from the beginning, didn't play too long, quit and rejoined 
a couple times and moved on. I was beta testing and playing AO upon
release, quit a little over a week ago when it became apparent the game 
was a turkey [ IMO ] and was then in nowhere land with nothing to play.

While waiting for DAoC I decided to return to EQ, figuring it's only a
couple months and maybe EQ would hold my interest until then.

I too had deleted all my characters so I was starting from scratch.
I found this to be not all that bad. I'm finding it fun creating new 
characters, [  I must have done about 10 so far :-) ] and a lot of the
game seems new after being away for a long time. Still trying to settle
on what I want to play. 

So in short, I say you don't really have much to lose.  Jump back in
and if you have a good time great--if not you only spent 10 bucks.

Jim
