Faydedar is a bitch.

Reaver is a bitch if you have no one experienced in that zone...otherwise
they're pretty easy.

When Black Reavers die they will immediately spawn either another Black
Reaver or a KOS ghost or an indifferent ghost (I forget their names, I've
only seen the KOS one in my 5-6 trips there to do reavers).  Generally
you'll get around 2 or 3 BRs then the ghost.

With 4 tanks, 2 clerics, a mage and an enchanter we killed *7* Reavers and
the KOS ghost (much easier than a reaver) plus 3 minor annoyances that all
came at us at once.  We were all rather shocked that no one died...I don't
recommend doing that. :)

The reaver drop is not very common.  It's entirely possible to kill 8 BRs
and not get one reaver.  Luckily there are enough BR spawn points (3 I think
but I'm not a puller) and the respawn time isn't horrible (I've heard 90
minutes...can't confirm that) and there's lots of xp critters to kill around
there to spend the time in between...and other epic critters laying about as
well if you know the zone.
