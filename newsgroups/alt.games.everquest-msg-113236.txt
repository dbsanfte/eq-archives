And those people should also be intelligent enough to realize that said
druid is probably anonymous because he or she does not wish to be pestered
at this time, no matter how politely.

BTW, I play a shaman, and get pestered for SoWs and PLs far too frequently,
and guess what, sometimes I completely ignore the requests.  Sometimes I
might reply.  If they are polite, and I am not too busy, I will often SoW
them, I will not PL a stranger however.
