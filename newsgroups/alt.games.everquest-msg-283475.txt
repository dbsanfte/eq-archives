Note where LDoN is in terms of progression and gear.  It's instanced 
content with Elemental quality loot, in an environment where you will 
have guilds competing for non-instanced spawns.

Wrong, I can put together a 50 person raid on Fennin Ro for which the 
loot in those LDoN raids IS an upgrade.  Not all raiding is at the 
highest end of the game (thank God).  However, my main point was and 
still is, the change was made for the progression server and just rolled 
out to the others because they can.

We raid once a week, a collection of family / casual guilds who are now 
EP flagged, kill DoN dragons and STILL raid with some people who are 
level 56 if the level requirements don't prevent them.

We never enforce attendance, we encourage but don't restrict which 
character you can bring and we raid anything which people don't usually 
see, as well as farming loot stuff for people to get upgrades.  For a 
long time, most of our raid force wasn't even level 70 although that has 
changed naturally over time as those people have levelled.

I wish people didn't see EQ in such a black and white no-raid or 
high-end-raid light.  There is a spectrum of activity in EQ, and we're 
considering the LDoN raids as viable targets now that,

1. we won't have to turn people away due to the restriction on numbers
2. we can add people who turn up late
3. the main mechanic which made them a bitch for casuals is gone (death 
count)
