    You snipped miles and miles of post, to quote this?

> Who in hell has EVER had a fungi in their early career?

    Any one of the twinks of the 400+ people in the Elemental Planes on my
server, and on the other servers, had they wanted to buy them. Any of the
twinks of the people who bothered to go down there and farm the Fungi King
when the Fungi was his COMMON drop. Anyone who picked one up in EC back when
they hit a low of 30 K pp, cash which even then one could work towards if
one was willing to spend the time it took.

    No, and if you included the rest of the post, with lines like this:

If you don't have this, an
FBSS (CoF isn't worth the cash to someone looking to be good on a budget),
some smart armour selections, and some of the cheaper 0.5 ratio weapons in
the game have you killing like a champ. Oh, and get some ten slot packs for
the bandages.

    you'd realize that. But as soon as you saw the word "Fungi" something in
your brain shorted out and you went off on a massive tangent.

    Yes, quite. Do you?

    If "second class citizenship" is determined by ability to solo, yes, I
am. If you're using any other measure, no, I'm not. As I said in my post,
which you snipped:

But to say
it [KEI - James] must be nerfed because it creates an imbalance between
casters and melees
that must be corrected is as assinine as it gets. Jealousy nerfs are
pointless, because every class should be able to do something better than
all other classes. So unless you're prepared for an endless round of "I
should get X, because I don't have Y and class Z has Y", quit it. If it
should be nerfed, it should be nerfed because the benefits of KEI far
outstrip what the designers intended any item or buff to give someone below
the level at which KEI will land.

    Yeah, because my ability to solo as a cleric has been so powerful for my
EQ career compared with the abilities of shadow knights, paladins, monks,
bards, and the newcomer BSTs. I must have imagined it when monks and
paladins in my guild used to take pity on me and invite me to join them in
their Fungus Grove killing sprees "so you can get some XP too". I must have
been confused by the massive trains of mobs bards would run all over the
place, killing mob after mob until areas were barren of life. And those BSTs
that gained levels faster than I ever could have imagined at that level must
have all been the twinks of rich folks wearing Fungis, right?

    Fucking moron. Oh, and before you accuse me of having a million caster
twinks that are secretly powering up with KEI, here's my entire twink list.
See if you can spot the trend: 55 ROG, 47 WAR, 41 NEC, 40 MNK, 40 SHM, 39
ENC, 34 MAG. All on the same account as me, all gained levels without having
a second character standing over them. Only one of them (the SHM) has ever
had KEI, none of them have owned Fungis.

    James
