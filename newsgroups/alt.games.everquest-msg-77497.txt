Last night while camping the Flame Tower in Lake Rathe, a level 20 druid,
and a Beastlord came up and decided they wanted to "help" me camp the Tower.
Now, I'm level 19 and can't usually keep all three Aviaks down, so I figured
as long as we didn't get into eachothers way, it shouldn't be a problem.

I came up the ramp to the tower, I harmonied one, and snared the other. I
pulled it down the ramp to a corner to root, and kill it away from the other
people. Now, mind you, they never asked me if they could share the spawn,
just invited themselves. The second I got the Aviak down the ramp, the
beastlord sent his pet down, with him trailing my Aviak. I could see from my
text screen that the pet was attacking it, so I unloaded on the Aviak and
took my kill. It wasn't two seconds before the druid starts screaming in
shout that it was his spawn and that nobody had been there when they
arrived. I then told him that I had been there, and that I had been camping
the Aviaks for 2 hours. He continues his /shout about how I can't hold the
spawn and he and his friend are going to take it from me, and that I should
go to the arena Aviaks if I want to hunt. At this point I went to /tell. I
told him that I was here, and if he wanted to share the spawn, I would be
more than happy to oblige, but I had been there first, and would continue to
hunt there till I was finished.

Here is where he gets stupid. After medding, I went back up the tower, and
pulled another Aviak. This one was yellow to me, so it took me a couple of
tries to get snare and root to stick once down the slope. The second another
Aviak spawned on top of the tower, he pulled it down and brought it to me
trying to train it on me, all the while /saying "Here is your spawn...take
it...it is yours." The funny thing was, as long as I had the yellow Aviak
rooted, the Aviak he brought down wouldn't attack me, and was chasing him
around beating on him. I can only assume that his health was down too far,
and his BL buddy had to come kill it.

I did petition the event, although no one came to answer it. He got real
friendly at this point, and sent a heal my way. He then asked me again if I
would go over to the arena Aviaks. I told him that when I logged on they
were taken, and that was why I came over here. He then told me he would go
check for me to see if they were still being camped. I told him not to
bother.

I wish I had /logged the event. I couldn't believe that he was telling me
that he was going to take a spawn. I have been playing for a while and have
come across some real winners, but geesh. Am I in the wrong here??
