I believe that the arena that is in the Bazaar needs to be offloaded onto
its own dedicated zone.  When Luclin was first launched I saw this huge
arena located in the Bazaar and thought that it would be a cool spot to hold
events.  Unfortunately, since the LAG in the bazaar caused by the large
number of traders and buyers has caused this zone to be unstable for any
massive PVP event.  It would be great if the GMs would hold weekly events
here.  I occasionally see an event being held in the ARENA off of lake rathe
but that spot is stuck in the middle of nowhere.  Also, you have to pay just
to enter into the zone if an event is being held.  A friend of mine who has
played almost since EQs launch said that you used to not have to pay to see
one fo these events.  He would always come into the zone, levitate himself,
get to the top of the scafold above the stage and deuff the levitate.  He
would have a prefect veiw of everything going on.

Add more events and do something with the ARENA in the bazaar.
