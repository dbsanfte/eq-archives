When playing my warrior, I'll ALWAYS take a Str or Dex buff.  Str
helps with maximum damage output (you'll hit for closer to your max
damage more often), and Dex does indeed help with criticals, along
with (I think) double attack and dual weild.  Regen/Chloro is also a
must for any tanks you got sucking up damage for you.
