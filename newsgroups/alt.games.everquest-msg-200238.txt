    Random numbers are random. Once you've done 100 smithing combines, tell
us about the success rate. Not that you'll ever see 100 smithing combines.

    Chips of granite. Only with chips, until you have a set of three you
don't have anything. They have to be powdered in a Mortar and Pestle, and
they get combined three at a time. Real pain in the arse.

    Hmm, that seems low compared to what we see when we do the mud ring. I
wonder if the later spawns in the ring have a higher drop chance?

    At least those yellows are awesome XP, if you can tank them efficiently.
And if your puller doesn't also bring armadillos to camp (hate, hate, hate
dillos).

    There's two named trees. One is towards the back of the zone, and I've
seen a druid-only POS earring off him. The other drops the CLR earring,
which is at least an upgrade on Solstice.
