Well, now your just a deliberate fucktard tyger.

But taking your bait, (but completely overlooking the more fucktardier
elements): Yes,  I have complete and utter control over <whether or not I
pass on> my genetics to a new generation or not. If I choose to have
children and they turn out to have a mental illness and blow their brains
out later on as a teenager then I will take full responsibity for that since
the overwhelmingly largest factors contributing to that scenario are:

- A known genetic predisposition that exists in my family for nutcasery.
- Adverse environment of being brought up in a dysfunctional family (ie: one
that includes a nutcase).

People have to take responsibility for their offspring - full stop.
