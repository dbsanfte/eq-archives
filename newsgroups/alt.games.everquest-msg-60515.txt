This is a big problem with the Ro armour quests, and personally not liking
to kill faeries myself I have not done it, though I have collected a bit of
faerie dust - through killing the undead sprites that were in LFay a couple
of months back - they also dropped the dust.  No longer on my server though
(which I prefer really, cos the faeries are now back in their village again
:-) ), but I have heard rumors that there are some servers with them still
in there???

But now I have just bought the Ro armor anyway (some pieces at least, have
other armor for some spots).  The latest one that Verant has really stuffed
is the best Paladin (also SK too) two-hand sword in the game currently has
just recently been discovered - dropping from Tunare! :-(  Says a lot really
for who Verant thinks are more important - the powergamers who couldn't care
about RPing.
