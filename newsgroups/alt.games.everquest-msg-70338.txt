Some background...

I am a 52 Rogue on Xev as some of you know.  Last night, as I was turning in
an epic quest item to a NPC in Highhold pass,  I met a level 51 Rogue,
Mordicuss.  He was a few steps behind me in my epic and we had a nice chat.
His next step was to go to Steamfont and kill Renux, a nasty little rogue.
I told him that I had killed her on Sunday and offered to help.  Renux quads
for 200, backstabs for almost 300 and procs a nasty spinning poison.  I
killed her on Sunday with around 25 friends, took a few minutes but suffered
3 deaths before the tank could get agro.  Mordicuss said his guild had
killed her a few times and he didn't expect any trouble.  We said goodbye
and parted ways.

fast forward 4 hours... The fight

I get a tell from Mordicuss asking how to spawn Renux.  I told him and he
said he was about to spawn her.  He said I could come help if I wanted to
and since I was nearby in ButcherBlock Mountains, I said I would come.  I
meet him in Gfay and He introduces me to his Renux killing party.   Him, (51
rogue), Bounta (52 paly), Laleny (50 necro), Riechle (60 ranger) and
Liladare (60 Cleric).   "That's all!!!???!!" I ask him in tell.  "We will be
fine", he replied.

I was stunned but thought maybe he know what he was doing, and the fact that
we would have a level 60 cleric buffing and healing us, I thought maybe it
would work.  Just then Bounta (52 paly) says he can't stand it anymore and
needs to go shower, "afk 15 min."  doh!,  The rogue decides not to wait and
we all run off to Steamfont. I was nervous but resigned to my fate at this
point.  We find the quest mob and prepare to spawn Renux.  I politely ask
"umm,,,, what is our plan here?" and the ranger says "I will tank her, snare
her, and lead her around with Trueshot and bowkite, you rogues will backstab
and the necro will have a rogue pet do the same".

ok....I thought, it MIGHT work. (sigh)

"ready" the rogue shouts, and spawns Renux.   We backed up a bit to let the
ranger get argo.  Renux started to beat on the Ranger.  Never saw a life bar
drop so fast!  Ranger was down in less then 8 seconds.  Cleric says "WTF,
did he run?"  Renux is standing there unargoed by the rest of us.  She will
despawn any second because no one is hitting her so I decide to be brave and
go attack her.  She starts killing me and I try to kite her for the others
so the ranger can be rezzed.   The cleric Cheals me and Renux goes to the
cleric.  Cleric dead in 5 seconds and wakes up in NK.   Necro is sitting
near.   Necro killed next, 4 seconds and is bound in Velious.  Renux heads
for me and stuns me.  Just me and the other rogue left.  I die in 3 seconds
and appear in Gfay.  I hear in group talk that the last rogue is running
around with Renux following him.

I start to think of nice words of condolence and that I would help him
restart his failed epic quest.  I begin to head back to Steamfont and meet
the naked ranger at the zone into Lfay.  In Steamfont, the rogue is shouting
"Hurry! I am almost dead".   As I and the ranger run to the fight scene I
go.... lockup LD!!!!! doh.

I reboot, log back into EQ as fast as I can (4 min or so) and appear naked
in Steamfont.  I shout "Am back from LD, you still alive".   "GET OVER
HERE!" the rogue shouts and off I go.  I find my body and loot my gear and
run to the fight.    The ranger is back and has his gear.  He is leading a
snared Renux around while the Rogue is following, piercing and stabbing
away.  I wade in (no buffs!) and do the same.  Renux is at about 80 percent
life at this point.

fast forward 20!!! min...

Renux is at 10 percent life.  The ranger is out of arrows and is trying to
chain snare to keep argo.   We are backstabbing and piercing as fast as we
can.   The (now clean) pali is back from afk and has managed to find us in
Steamfont and is helping chase Renux.   5 percent....  5 min later, Renux
stops chasing the ranger and stands there as we beat her dead.  DEAD!  Woot!

I was frigging stunned!  What a rush!. What a lucky bastard to pull that
cluster off.  He was so happy, he let me loot a rare Ravenscale mask (11 ac
and permanent "see invis") for helping him.  That made my death worthwhile.
The 60 cleric managed to port back about now and rez the corpses so I even
got most of my exp back.

So now I have killed Renux with both extremes, Maximum firepower and Minimum
"iron man" tactics.  (I prefer the overpowered way, hehe).   The rogue also
told me he would send me a tell when he trys to kill the general and that I
could come along and do it after him.   I WILL try to get more to help
whatever party he comes up with, LOL!

just a tale
