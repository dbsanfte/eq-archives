I haven't seen anyone with a surname yet. You only get to choose a first 
name at character creation but right in your persona window are two 
drop-down lists for a "prefix" and a "suffix", both empty initially. I 
recently attained the status of "Gnoll Hunter" and so I have an available 
suffix of "Hunter of Gnolls", which I haven't chosen to display. I see 
people running around with names like "Acadia, Slayer of Undead", and even 
"Woad, Hunter of Fairies". But I've yet to see a prefix or an actual 
surname. Not that there aren't any, but I haven't seen any.
