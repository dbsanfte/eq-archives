You might try the newbie area in Steamfont (west from PoK book) and
work over the kobolds there. You should be able to get xp from them
and being a pet-using class should make it safer/easier.

They inhabit 3 camps of various sizes, all in sight of each other. Are
apparently not social and not aggressive. Their only casters are
shamans with low-level shaman spells and they aren't always up. No
gnome guards path through the area. The only significant npc that will
probably attack you is an ogre, Bubblegup, who paths through there
from time to time.

Hides are worth 6-8 gp depending on charisma and their teeth are worth
3-4 gp, all stackable. The plentiful scalps are no drop and for Akanon
armor quests (I think). They also drop containers, alcohol,
springwater, pieces of armor/clothes, rations, etc. , and have some
coin.

The kobolds turn green around 8 or 9 (I think) and Bubblegup is about
that level.

Since I am not on FV, YMMV.
