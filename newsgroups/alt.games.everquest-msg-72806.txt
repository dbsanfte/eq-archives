Anyone had problems with doing the iksar monk Shackle of Rock quest?

I am on it now, and had 2 serious problems. I got the box from Cabilis i 
have to deliver to TD, get a port to SRo (i know, can run to OT, 
sneak/FD my way through and get on boat, but safer the other way), get 
to Oasis and take the boat. Jump of boat to get to the next boat, take 
that untill it start to swing towards the OT zone, swim to Chess Island.

Find the iksar master, give box. But got no reply, and i should have 
faction problems, done the earlier quests, and gotten reply from him then.
Spend 20 min trying to figure out how to get him to respond.
Canp just at his feet and go to Allakhazam to find the correct phrase to 
use.

Log in again, and find myself on the barrel barge outside the outpost in 
OT. Been over 10 min from i left the boat untill i camped (camped 
normally, not a /q), but still wakt up in another zone sitting on the boat.

So had to get the boat back to TD to get to the Iksar Master again to 
try the phrase out. Finally get him to respond and give me the box to 
collect his items in.


Anyone else had problems with him not responding after giving him the 
first box, or with waking up in OT instead of TD?
