Well, there is a ruined building in LoIO a little ways out from Cabilis
which is inhabited by skeletons (level 4-6) and scalebone skeletons
(level 7-9). Single pulling them is easy due to their low aggro radius.
I'd think a young cleric could have a field day with Ward Undead here.
There are roaming skeletons, goblins, sarnaks, and Iksar outcasts
to watch out for. They're pretty widely spaced, though.

On the downside is that the nearest merchant and bank are way off
at the windmill and in FV respectively. That would be a bit of a
convenience problem for a level 7 who doesn't have scaly skin.
