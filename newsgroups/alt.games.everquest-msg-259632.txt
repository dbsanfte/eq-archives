Hi Bob. :-) foamy [ Jim ] here, with a new nick. :-)

Man that's great you got into the other game. :-)

I changed my e-mail  because of the quantity of spam I was getting, and 
screwed any chance of getting in. 

I bought CoH a few days ago and am already bored. Other than the character 
creation which is great, I think the game is a mile wide and 1/2 an inch deep.

How's WoW compared to all the other games we've played from UO on ?
What would you say it most resembles in game play ?

Does it look like a keeper ?

Regards
Jim
