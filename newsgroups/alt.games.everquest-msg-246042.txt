IMHO, the best places to get hides are:

hq bear hides - Poacher camp in jagged pine (these will also drop you hq
wolf and cat, and med and low quality as well.  no ruined)

HQ hopper hides - seem to drop well in Scarlet Desert, along with superb and
flawless hides, which you will need later on in your tailoring.  The damaged
hides don't drop so much here as in shadeweavers.

have fun
JC
