Anarchy Online probably has the most advanced graphics of any of the current
lot of MMORPGs. It does look really nice, but it lacking in players last
time I was on (a few months ago).
Asherons Call 2 is in beta at the moment and you can get screenshots (maybe
movies) from IGN.com. You can download the beta from GameSpy (you dont have
to be a subscriber any more). Or you could wait for StarWars Galaxies or
Everquest 2 when they come out next year (not sure about dates).
