}a few, due to ignorance about the whole corpse poofing phenomena.

That did happen to me once, waay back in the beginning (for me, which was 
just after Kunark came out).  It wasn't entirely my fault, I was led 
astray by a misleading statement in the rulebook that came with my copy of 
the game.  It suggested that, at my level, it was either 24 hours or a 
week that I had to recover my corpse.  Hence, I got some sleep before 
running back to Qeynos Hills from my bind point in Ak'anon (quite a trek 
in those days!) and was quite confused that my corpse was missing a mere 
11 hours later.  Luckily, a very kind GM helped me out, or I probably 
would have quit in disgust over the entire outfit of raw silk I'd lost.

}  But I would
}guess not very many.  How many corpses have poofed because the someone got
}called away to military service, had ISP issues, or other real life concerns
}that simply prevented them from coming back?  I would guess probably a 
}few more than the first scenario.  I just don't think that either 
}scenario happens enough to have that big of an impact on the dumbing down 
}of the game.

/agree

}   I'll tell you what I think is really going on.  I think that SOE is getting
}ready to just do away with in game customer service at all.  You get stuck
}somewhere?  Use the /rewind feature and hope for the best.  You die in a
}horrible place with no chance of doing a CR?  Oh well, just wait a week and
}you're body will turn up in the Graveyard.

Eh, I think they're trying to eliminate as many of the 'gruntwork' CS jobs 
as they can.  Then they'll need less staff, so they can fire all the CS 
people who suck and keep the good ones.  And those good ones will then 
have more time to deal with -real- CS issues that matter, like when quest 
such-and-such is bugged and the bastard eats your hard-won items.
