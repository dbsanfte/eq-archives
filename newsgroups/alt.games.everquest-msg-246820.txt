Technically that is a risk. Ever see A Clockwork Orange :) But that's 
not the point.

If you *do* want to let someone in, then you *do* have to open a door. 
That is self-evident. There is a very good reason that opening a door is 
a requirement to letting people in... squeezing them through the keyhole 
is excutiatingly painful.

The *difference* between this scenario and the SOE beta app is that 
there is no good reason to require users to open their doors with 
IE+ActiveX. ActiveX is entirely unnecessary to the beta app process... 
except that they decided to make it a requirement.

When you want to let someone into your house, you just have to open the 
door, *its a sensible requirement*. If someone showed up at your house 
and told you to remove the lock, and cut your phone lines as a 
requirement for them to get in... you'd wonder what they injected...
