On Morell Thule they always seem to depart from the SRo wizard platform,
for no visible reason... I suppose because thats a relatively unused zone
and there are no mobs there that would be a threat even to a naked level
46 PC regardless of faction.

POA Raids exactly the same departure location, for probably the same
reasons plus anyone dropping over the side will have a short run back
to the formup spot...

Nektulous or Bazarr strike me as better spots for a POA formup
since that would put you near a handy source of coffins, or did the
whole "duel, summon corpse, revive" plan get killed since the
last time I used it, which has to be over a year ago?
