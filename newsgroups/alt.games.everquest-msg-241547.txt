Should have done casserole dishes instead of poison vials. Much cheaper.

How high? You can get to 199 making casserole dishes:
Components: casserole dish sketch, ceramic lining, large block of clay,
water flask
In: pottery wheel, tanaan pottery wheel

You can buy all the components in abysmal sea. Takes less than 2pp per
attempt, all vendor bought.
They even have a pottery wheel there.
You should stop complaining, and do some research :P

Actually it takes 2 sapphires, which is about the same price as 1 diamond.
