Yak (the tradeskill guy at Verant) has said at past FanFairs that only Dex
(for Fletching) and Str (for Smithing) can work as secondary skill-up checks
in place of Int/Wis

2/40 = 95%... bang on the max-success number :o)
There's a little variation because of the not-so-random number generator
(personally had 6 failures in a row on arrows that trivialed at 46, when my
skill is at 202) but on average you get one failure per stack, no matter how
skilled you are.

There's a rough formula to give an idea of your possible success rate that's
been posted on EQTraders.com... but I can't find it right now.

I'm guessing (based only on observation) that YES mods stack, but like
Flowing Thought there's a 'total mod' cap... and the mods themselves don't
multiply, they just add... for example...

(Skill 200) plus (Primary Slot +10%) plus (Range Slot +10%) = total
'effective skill' 240 (rather than 242)

The 'effective skill' only changes your success chances (making some things
easier to produce)... you can still gain a skill-up if the trivial level is
above your unmodified skill, but below your modified skill.

Yes, your baby Iksar can forage Dragon Eggs... but they'll be frustratingly
rare. Foraging SEEMS to work like this...

Basic skill check for success vs 'Pseudo Trivial' (this appears to be
between 80 and 100... just like a 'combine' in tailoring)

If you pass that check, you roll on the zone forage table... roll high
enough and you then stand a chance of getting the one of the zone-specific
rare drops

It's at his point your skill checks again, and sometimes you only get a
regular root/veg/fruit/berry... but any forage skill has that 'minimum
chance' of getting a 'rare', modified by the zone's forage table...

107%

>200... and it can break :o(
I'm guessing you're already AT 200 and you've already GM'd another
tradeskill... maybe it's time my Druid got out his rod and bait again...
first char to hit Fishing 250? That'd make my Granddad (a keen angler) proud
of me :o)
