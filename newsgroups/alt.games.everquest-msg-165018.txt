Im not sure if you would get all hits,  the radius on seeing other hits
seems kinda buggy when guildies have tried it in the past

Thats too high for primal.  Primal is fantastic becase of the avater proc,
not really because of the weapons stats (although 15/20 isn't that bad, it
sure isn't *uber*)

Tendonslicer is an ok weapon, but it doesn't have a proc like other 15/20
+BS mod pokers, so will parse a little lower.  I don't know rogues,
admittedly, but again 180dps seems far too high.  Especially given were
talking level 63ish mobs! What level are the monks/rogue?

I can ask some guildies to parse using primal/bloodbath, primal/tunare poker
etc if you like (all level 65 rogues)

That parser sounds out of sync with the parsers I've used.. by a huge
degree.  I've seen it said a few times that to compare 2 people/weapons, you
have to use the same program each time.. but these differences are huge

Primal has been well tested and proven to give a huge dps boost

Im not a 2hb person, so Im not really familiar with 2hb designs (well, other
than my primal bat and TS) so im not sure which weap your describing.   I'd
love to know, if you see him again to ask.

Ferocity is improved chances of double attack.  Did the 2hb monk have
certain AA's that the primal monk didn't?

Ambidex, Ferocity, Punishing, Technique of master wu are the main "dps
increasing" abilities.
