    Which the original poster (a level 10 wizard) can't.  Which is why I
didn't discuss them... not being remiss in my wizardly duties.
    For higher level Wizards, if you are groupped in a zone where you are
encountering stuff that is giving you full resists (even moderately
routinely), mem an evac... and make SURE you have gate ready in case you're
the one left behind.
    Though I'm tempted to say that if you of a level where this strategy is
viable, and you needed to be told this that you should give your account
back to the guy you bought it from.  Since Wizards are no longer THE
undisputed masters of mana damage, and are instead the masters of arcane
transportation <vomit> (how can you be a master traveler without SOW?!), you
should probably have learned about teleporting the hell out of a situation
before you are of a level to be responsible for others.

Okay, oops, I was remiss... Yes, I should have mentioned this.

And from my experience a resisted nuke gives the same amount of aggro that a
full damage one does (sometimes more [okay, not really more, but when
Tishan's Clash doesn't stick the tanks don't have the 2 seconds to build
their hate levels back up so it definitely seems like more]).

You can also do this to pull a mob off of warriors if you need to... though
I assure you, it needs to be mostly dead, because you will NOT last long.
You can tank for about ONE round or maybe two to let a rogue get in a back
stab to end a battle (in this situation, if the rogue can't end the battle
in one or two back stabs, whack the snot out of your "Gate" hot key... you
MIGHT luck out and live).

Okay, that isn't totally true... but if you're intentionally over nuking to
pull aggro, it is true enough.  (I've actually tanked an entire battle once
or twice... not on purpose... and sucked a LOT of mana from the cleric as a
result... but it is NOT what we wizards are meant to do... and if a group
expects you to "do your share of tanking" ... gate as soon as the next mob
is pulled... and when they ask you why, tell them to fuck off... as I have
often wished I had).

Yep, assuming of course that you're of the level that your cleric will have
a res. spell of some description... in which case, see above.

34, I believe.  It not only is a better damage shield, it actually improves
the target's fire resistance as well.  I have not seen it stack with
anything, though.  I'm not COMPLETELY certain that it doesn't... just pretty
sure, since a Druid seemed to overwrite it (message went from "MOB is
burned" to "MOB is pierced by thorns" within the duration of the spell
(which I know because I cast it on myself first to know when the tanks
needed refreshing).

(though, again, I only mentioned "radiation" because the original poster was
only level 10... well, that and everyone else's damage shields of the same
level are better than the wizard's)
