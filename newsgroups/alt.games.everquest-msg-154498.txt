What I don't understand is why they can't automate tuning these things.
They know the formulas (I *hope* they know the formulas, rather than they
are magic in code that is so hacked and crufty from years of fiddling that
no one knows what it does!).  They should be able to write a program to
examine encounters and adjust the mobs.
