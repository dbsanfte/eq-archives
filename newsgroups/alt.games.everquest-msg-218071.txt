Kill lots of stuff...

From what I've seen and heard, most plat guides are outdated wastes of time.
Just search the groups or the web, and you can pretty much find what the
guids tell you.  One example that I've seen, is the guide tells you to make
tons of plat making "TRADESKILL ITEM" (fish rolls, etc) but that item was
nerved ages ago.

Would help to know your level...silk farming is tedious, but makes money.
There's quests, ore farming in CC, kill Hill Giants, etc...depends on what
level you are really.
