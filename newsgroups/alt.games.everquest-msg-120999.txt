lurkin. you need to grow up. only people who play 20 hours a day and are
obese can be so pissed about such things.

as for people who play 2 hours a day, its not a big deal, because its only 2
hours, and they can wait.

you need to thank verant for LETTING you play EQ. i have been playing since
3/99, and i have only had a really small amount of discomfort due to the
servers being down.

its not like they are trying to fuck with you by putting the servers down,
read my post about the other guy bitching.
