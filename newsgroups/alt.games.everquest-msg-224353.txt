Necromancers get two mez spells throughout their illustrious careers.
Screaming Terror at level 24 and Death's Silence at level 63.  Screaming
Terror works on mobs up to level 55 and lasts 3 ticks, this spell allows a
necromancer to mez up to 2 adds, baring resists of course.  Death's Silence
works on undead mobs up to level 65 and lasts 5 ticks.  Screaming Terror can
be extremely useful in the hands of a competent player.  Many people are
completely unaware that necromancers are event capable of mezing mobs;
sadly, this includes many necromancers themselves.  In okaying my cleric
many times I have had to explain how to use ST.  It seems many young
necromancers just write the spell off since it has such a short duration and
mezing 2 mobs consumes a necromancer's full attention, leaving her unable to
do the fun killing part.  In LDoN, ST is effective up until the level 60
dungeons where, in my experience, 30% of the mobs are over level 55.  Unlike
pacify, ST does not give the "This creature cannot be mesmerized by this
spell"  message until after the spell has attempted to land, which is going
to create some pretty serious aggro for the necromancer if she isn't
prepared to deal with it.  The level 65 LDoN dungeons have no creatures
under 55, save the non aggro greens, which takes necromancers out of the
mezing role save for undead mobs.
