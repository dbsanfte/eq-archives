Actually, I can appreciate that. The growing loss of privacy we're
seeing is a disturbing thing.

In a perfect world, the poll should have a "NOYB" option on it.

At least Verant isn't doing this on the sly, as they certainly could -
I mean, you're running software they wrote, designed specifically to
communicate with their servers... it would be an easy matter for them
just to get the information programmatically.

My advice to you - lie on the poll.
