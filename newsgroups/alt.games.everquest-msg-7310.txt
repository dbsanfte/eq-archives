  No kidding.  Last week I was bored, and created a Barbarian
warrior for the epic "Level 1 Untwinked Halas-Velious Glory Run".
Died twice, both times before I got to Blackburrow.  Got drive
by SoWs twice.  Got offered an escort but refused it.  Never got
invis'ed.  Worse thing that happened is that I fell into a crevasse
in Eastern Wastes and had to petition to be pulled out by a guide
(who gasped in astonishment when I told him what I was up to).
I made it to Kael Drakkel, before being killed by two giants of 
some sort that guarded the entrance to a tunnel or something.
Well, only one killed me, with one hit, but they both were trying.
The trick is to stick to the coastlines, and resist the urge to
see what walrus looks like up close.

Annie  <--- Unfortunately, couldn't resist the urge to shout out in
            EW "Very brave lvl 1 tank LFG".  No takers, oddly enough.
