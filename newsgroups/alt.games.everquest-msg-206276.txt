It has always been applied to physical goods that are purchased outside 
of where people live, and it has been applied to local virtual services 
and goods already as well, they just added in regulations that force it 
to be applied to virtual goods and services that are purchased outside of 
your own country now as well.

The way it worked before, people could use an out of country ISP, say, 
AOL UK for example from France, and not pay the VAT, whereas if they used 
a local ISP, they did have to pay the VAT, basically, the EU levelled the 
playing field for services and virtual goods provided from abroad.
