and why is "warmly" not enough? in fact, it seems to me that "warmly" should
be better than "regards you as an ally"
warmly, to me, implies "warm fuzzy" feelings, while "regards you as an ally"
implies simply that they're friendly towards you.

and it's not as though these quests are easy to begin with.
