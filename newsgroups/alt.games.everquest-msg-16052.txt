I've not tried this, so I don't know how well it would balance out the
faction hits, but its worth a try:

First, kill lots of erudin guards, erudin emissaries etc to get in with
the Heretics. Killing a guard should give you a bigger faction hit than
killing a kobold in the Warrens :)

Next, fix your now-trashed Erudin faction by giving lots of treant wood
chips to Emil Parsini in the hut outside Erudin.

The wood chips give Erudin Council, guard and merchant faction. Its part
of some cleric/pally quest where you go on a huge long runaround to get
1 treant wood chip. However, you can do this faction-building bit
multiple times by getting your wood chips using the NPC for the trueshot
bow quest (i.e. give 1 small lantern to Jyle Windshot for each wood chip
- he's upstairs in the Hogcaller inn in W Freeport). The chips stack, so
you could quite easily fill up a couple of backpacks in Freeport before
heading to Tox.

I've used this method to fix Erudin faction just to buy/sell, and its
taken maybe a few stacks of chips to go from dubious to amiable with the
merchants.
