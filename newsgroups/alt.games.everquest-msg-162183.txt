In the center of the SK gnoll spires is a tunnel that leads to Splitpaw,
a cheerful, sprawling gnoll metropolis. Thanks to an excellent educational
system, each gnoll or gnollette can pursue the life of a warrior, rogue,
cleric, enchanter, or other casting career. In addition, these wealthy
caninoids offer exciting challenges for the mid-20's adventurer, as well
as those in the high 30's -- and even beyond! Bring a group though,
becuase there's no room to kite here, and they don't take Visa!
