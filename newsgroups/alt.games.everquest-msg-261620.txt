Have you ever had lev?  If so, how can you ask this question?

I can turn my clipping plane way down so that I'm getting max possible
framerate and fly completely over the second wall in PoFire.  I used to be
able to completely clear Karnors in Dreadlands the same way.  With clipping
plane all the way out, I will drop faster.

Everybody knows this...

You could become un-KOS in Highkeep, Paineel, Freeport, ToV and *Chardok* in
the time it would take you to become un-KOS in FV.  As someone who has done
all of the above at one time or another, I speak from experience.  =)

We're not talking days.  We're talking weeks, if not months.
