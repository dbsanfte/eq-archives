Preferred, but not as vital as the other two. Insert "tank class" as
#3 on the list, with warrior being #1 preferred tank class.

Bard can almost fill in for the enchanter and as a secondary tank in a
desperate situation...but he's better off backing up the enchanter
than trying to be the enchanter. OVerall, I'd say he'd slide in #4.
And they're hard to come by at high levels.
