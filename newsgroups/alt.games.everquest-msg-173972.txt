I know what you mean, yes, but innocent readers may not, and heaven 
forbid we let the poor things wander into EC shouting "WHERES THE 
BOOK????" ;p  And WC wasn't a particularly dangerous run even when it 
was just Luclin.  Longer, true, but doable from... well, I've done it as 
low as level 4.  Using the 'cowardly route' (taking the GFay spires), 
level 1 is also entirely possible.
