I upgraded from a TNT2 Ultra to a Hercules GeForce 3 last week.  The
difference is not major but it is better.  I am pretty sure I notice
smoother game play.  I also notice more vivid colors, although I don't
understand why that should happen.

I only have a 600MHz processor and 2 X AGP so I can't really use the
power of the card.  I upgraded because I'm ready to get a digital flat
panel display and the Hercules has the DVI output.  I'll upgrade the
motherboard and CPU when the chipsets finally support DDR RAM on a
Pentium IV and I am no longer restricted to Rambus memory.
