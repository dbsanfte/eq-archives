Yes, Everfrost is a great place to make quick cash if there are not too
many people hunting Mammoths, the zone can only hold about 25 people.
Anymore than that has folks stepping on each others toes. My Druid makes
70pp an hour in there. I wouldn't solo Mammoths as a warrior, though,
they hit for 50 a pop and downtime would be pretty bad. Team up with a
Druid who can track, snare, and fear the Mams. The damage output of the
warrior will mean the Druid will never run out of mana and it will be
non-stop pulling. Platform on Island is best camp, North tower is good
too.
