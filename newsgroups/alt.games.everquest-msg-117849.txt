No it doesn't. Video card CPU clock speeds are not related to the 
system's AGP bus speed. I don't recommend overclocking the AGP bus 
because the AGP bus is designed to be static at 66MHz. I have not seen a 
stable AGP bus past 75MHz.

The only reason CPUs have a fixed ratio like this these days is to 
*prevent* overclocking. There are ways around this, at least with 
Athlons, by physically closing the bridges on the CPU. I haven't done 
this though.

Indeed, but the bottleneck may not be here. The bottleneck could be in 
the memory bandwidth of the video card itself, or the clock speed of the 
video card.
