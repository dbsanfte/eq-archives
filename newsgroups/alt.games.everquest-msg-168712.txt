Guards in Felwithe have good loot.  Hill Giants are easy and good loot if
you play off hours (couple of hundred plat an hour easy),  Ice Giants at
entrance to Everfrost for cash and exp,  HHK guards and residents drop FS
and cash.  And, depending on your race, Neriak guards (in Neriak Commons)
can get you 300-500 pp an hour

Any of those may be good for you.
