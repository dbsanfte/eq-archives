Well, I do think you're all weird, actually ;-)

It's an invitation, for crying out loud. Where's the insult in that?

This may be different for other classes, but my guardian will on average get
such an invitation maybe once every 10 hours of play, so I doubt it's the
constant disturbance that bothers you. As a matter of fact, declining a
/tell takes a much greater effort and can be more disturbing if you're
sneaking around amongst straying red agros or having the fight of your life.

I always /tell first myself (mainly because I want people to join for the
right reasons), but if somebody is trying to form a group and think they
could use my abilities, I really take no offense if he/she sends me an
invite I didn't ask for. I may even follow up the negative response with a
"/tell NN Thanks, though".

Other times I will follow an impulse and accept such an invitation. Then,
I'll ask a few questions on the group channel, and the answers are usually
enough to tell if it's a moron group, in which case I'll just excuse myself
and disband again. This method has the added benefit that all group members
can follow the communication. I find that /invite is just many people's way
of establishing the contact. It doesn't necessarily mean that they're rude
or can't articulate themselves.

These impulsive group sessions are generally no less rewarding than the ones
I deliberately look for. If I don't want to join, one click is all it takes
to decline.

Given the thread so far, I'll probably be seen as totally weird, now :-)
