Hung up? No. It's a minor pet peeve. It's insight into the personality
of the person. The term is silly and childish. Tells me a little about
the person using it... "Toon" is a term that should be reserved for
comical, characture-ized animated figures. Bugs Bunny is a "toon".
Ashitaka (Princess Mononoke) is not.
