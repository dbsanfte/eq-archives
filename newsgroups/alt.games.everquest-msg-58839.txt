Hi.  I have a druid halfling (Lvl 24) with very little str and I've made a
few 10% weight reduction bags but I was wondering where I can get a little
higher weight reduction bag.  I know I saw one that the named orc in HIgh
pass hold was carrying (75%wt red?) but I missed the roll. (It was very
close though).

I've seen some bags for sale for 500pp but I don't have that, I barely have
enough to keep myself in spells.

All help appreciated,

Cousin Raven
