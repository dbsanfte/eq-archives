A rogue needs armor class also, Things do taunt onto the rogue, Evade
does sometimes fail, esp if you get hit as you are trying to evade, If
you don't have the ac/hp gear to take a couple of hits while the tank
get's the mob off you and back off yourself, you will quickly be dead or
kill your party by running your healer out of mana.  And a ragebringer
while one of the easier epics, can't be started til after level 50,
because the npc won't talk with you or reward you.

I am not saying the warrior isn't gear dependant also, but a rogue is on
a constant search for a better weapon at least until they get their
epic.  It's a close call, having never gotten a warrior past 21, and my
rogue only to 42, I don't have the end game experience to speak, but I
still feel for a rogue to do his best he is very gear dependant.  It may
devolve to one piece of equipment ultimately, but I still say they are
if not most, then definitely second.
