Now wait.  I agree that actually it's not surprising that somebody
came along and woke the Sleeper, even with the agreement in place.
But it is NOT, in the general sense, foolish to hold people to their
word.  And if things happened they way the seem to have, IC just
decided to be a bunch of little sorry babies and are well deserving of
the criticism they're getting now.

To be honest though, I'm surprised the 'agreement' lasted this long.
