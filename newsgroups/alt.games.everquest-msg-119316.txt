What specifically do you take issue with in my post? 

That Stasis was the instigator and driving force behind the
destruction of the Calendar and Rotations?    It is an established
fact.  There is no controversy about this.   They _brag_ about it!

>His posting history

So?   After a long time lurking I finally felt moved to post.  Does
that make my opinions less valid?

I can't think of anything more ridiculous than using post-count in
a.g.e as a measure of credibility.

Bzzzt.  Wrong.  Thank you for playing, and here is a copy of our home
game.

>Either way, RPs credibility is far more in question.

You keep appealing to argument ad hominem.  How about telling me WHAT
was inaccurate, misleading or less than credible about my post?

You are obviously trying to defend Sensei.  Very laudable.   Also
irrelevant, since I didn't attack him personally.   I  don't know him
at all.   I attacked his GUILD.  If you wish to defend _them_, let's
have at it.

My agenda is straightforward -- I dislike Stasis for what they did to
the Calendar and Rotations.

What is yours?
