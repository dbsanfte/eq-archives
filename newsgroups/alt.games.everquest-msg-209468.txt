Comic relief.

Make sure you invite level 1-6 players to join your group. Likewise invite
any level 65s you may see in the area.

Talk constantly about your level 60 druid and your level 59 necro. It is
actually much funnier if you don't really have a level 60 druid or level 59
necro. It may even be required.

Try to outdo the specialized classes in your group. For example, if there is
a cleric, try to out heal them. If there is a wizard, use your damage song.

Make sure you play a number of songs for no reason. If you are in an
experience group, play your invisibility song during fights and tell group
members it works better then the enchanter's mez.

Allways be the puller, particularily if there are other characters in the
group that can cast harmony or numb the dead. That way you can make sure
every pull is a train.

Remember to keep your drum equiped during the fight playing selo's and the
invisibility song.
