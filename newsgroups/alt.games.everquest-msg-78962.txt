    Different spells have different resist checks associated with them. For
example, a low-level necromancer can land Lifetap on ANY mob up to five
levels above him, and never see resists. When a friend was pulling named
mobs to my necro in The Warrens, I could kill anything within five levels
because I could chain-Tap it to death with no resists. Now, the proc off a
Lava Duct Crawler is a DoT that's tough to resist. Whether it's because it's
a Necro DoT, or possibly because it has no initial damage component (like
many Necro DoTs), I can't say for certain. What I can say is that even with
FR buffed, over a few levels of being in the Nox camp I never saw a main
tank in a full group of six resist the DoT for an entire combat.
