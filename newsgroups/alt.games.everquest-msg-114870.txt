I do know of one exception. The owner/bartender at the tavern we
frequent will still give the regulars a free round on the house on your
birthday. (And yes, that makes it an event. Not so much for the monetary
value as the unique opportunity of trying to get a free round out of
this bastard. You'd be more likely to get free money for an abortion out
of Pat Robertson.) But aside from that..... blah. I'd rather not be
reminded.  Even my wife knows by now not to make a big hoot over it, set
up a "surprise party" etc.
