I logged in yesterday at 7am EST just to find the servers were down...again.
I decided to go to chat to see if I could get some info about what was
happening and I ended up on General Chat 23.  Dear God!  How many people are
even up at 7am on a Sunday (that's 4am Pac and yes, I know that Europe and
Asia are alive and well at that hour, but still...)?  The whining was
rampant.  And the screen names of the bigest whiners were blatantly
offensive in many cases.  What was evenmore perplexing, to me, was the
penchant for these (for want of a better word) people to increase their
vehemence when a blue or red name popped.  It got so bad that serverwide
messages kept popping saying not to spam the chat groups and to keep it
clean (remember the EULA?).  It really was a bit embarrassing when I
rembered that I played the same game as these (for want of a better word)
people.
