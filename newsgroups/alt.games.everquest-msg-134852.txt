Well even as a bot, I don't think im a bad cleric (I've killed a red con
flurry mob with half a group, my monk tanking, and me running the 2
clerics).

I've also been one half of a cheal rotation versus Vindi (2 clerics? we must
have been mad!)..

Vindi got trained on us while we were forming for Vindi/Statue/AoW.. half
the people had started to camp but we fought on (the other cleric was a
"real" cleric)... keeping 1 tank up with 1 bot and 1 cleric was a pretty big
surprise, especially as nobody was expecting it  (I'd sat my shaman down to
camp, and used my monk to try and hold agro from campers)

My first time going into AL area tho, so not too worried that I died once :)

> So there you are.  Hmm, mob hitting me.  How hard?

800 a hit

>How fast?

FAST.  My monk was getting his ass handed to him

> Is it likely to be mezzed soon?

no

>Is it even mezable?

no

>Could I root  it and back off?

no.  We were in a really small room (50 people), 4 of these 61+ mobs going
on a rampage, and a guild of 40+ forming in the room behind us.  We couldnt
move because of mobs (and room design), we were geting pwnt on every damn
pull, and lagged to friggin hell andback :(

> heh, EQ just finished patching in my background.

Damn that deserves a big grats all on its own.   I left mine running before
I set off for work today.. wonder how it went.
