You zone in without buffs and start using your air supply.  That
takes a few seconds, more than enough for someone to cast EB on
you (or loot an EB item if you have one.)  The alternative is to
zone in with EB on yourself and drag your corpse to right by the
zone line.  You can then get a rez at the zone and safely zone out
to a zone with air before drowning.
