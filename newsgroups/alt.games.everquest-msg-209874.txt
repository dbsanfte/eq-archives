That's cause you're in a retarded group, dude!  :P

So you're saying that I make about twice as much exp as you do with a monk
tank and a beastlord slower in a lower tier zone like PoV or BoT?  And
that's with me always being at 90% AA exp cause I have to make up for raid
deaths.

So, figuring in cast and recast times on spells...   alright, I give up,
what are you AE'ing?  Crushbone?  Clerics get *one* nuke per AE fight.  Two,
perhaps, if their AE stun is refreshed (*120* second recast!!!).  So what
you are saying with 4 clerics and 2 enchanters is that every mob you kill
will be 5600 hp or less.  I'm sorry, Crushbone was uncalled for.  Why, you
could probably handle Lower Guk with that much power!
