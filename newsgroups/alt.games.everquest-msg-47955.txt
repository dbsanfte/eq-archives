Sadly, we should have had Miracle Max with us. Never even got to see it.
Another guild was already lined up and ready to go an hour before us. We
wound up splitting up and heading out to different places. (Kael,
Skyfire, etc.) But as to the method, you've got me curious. I'm only at
the beginning of my planes raiding career, but the experienced folk
organizing it definitely had two groups going up separately. A break
crew, and the main force coming up after. Is that not normal? Be good to
hear various methods groups employ. And wouldn't it count on the
number/level of raiders you have?
