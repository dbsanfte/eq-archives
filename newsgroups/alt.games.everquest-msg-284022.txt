	Nope.  All dot spells that don't have a second non-dot
component such snare or debuff stack no matter who casts them.
I regularly solo undead by stacking every one of those nice fire
dots (with their super negative resists) from boil blood to night
fire then practicing 1hb for the 2-3 ticks they stay up :-)

	(Undead are annoyingly resistant to poison and disease, and 
the imprecation/horror line  dont' have the nice negative resists fire
dots do.)

	Sure can.  

>So I could theoretically stack 15 dot's on a single mob?

	Only theoretically.  In practice the mob's dead by the
time you get to DOT #7 or so, or else it summons you so you have 
to stop casting...

	Shaman dots, too, so you can stack up all those poison spells.
