And, it is a bad analogy (a-nah-luh-jee).  The Nazi's were the ones in
power.  The ordinary citizen just followed the rules else they end up being
"disappeared".  A better analogy (a-nah-luh-jee) would be to call them a
Quizling (you know that one, don't you?  I thought not), much more akin to
the Judas analogy (a-nah-luh-jee) that you want to bring in.  Although, a
Judas would be more comperable to a Benedict Arnold (you know that one, too,
don't you?  I thought not).
