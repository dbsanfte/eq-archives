Ok. We did this last night. Got a fair ways along too. We also started 
with having my level 25 frog cleric alt turn in the cider. (He was 
indiff to Dalini). Bregun spawned and stayed up long enough for both my 
wife's necro and I to turn in the crunchies for the charm. We were 
dubious to Bregun, but he did business with us anyway.

Neither did we. :-)  The assling lives to eat more pies. he he.

He wasn't up the first night we went, but last night he was there when 
we arrived.

We didn't mez him. The file cabinet, shockingly, was indifferent to both 
of us and we just handed in the report and got the other one back just 
fine. The guard who spawned was green to level 65 and Tarre's pet wiped 
the floor with him in about fifteen seconds.

We both finished the second earring, got our containers in Katta (where 
I am an ally to all it seems, and they throw tickertape parades in my 
honor when I enter the city) and we've begun camping those damned report 
holders in Seru for the 3rd earring. They are a bit of a bitch for two 
casters to duo, but we're managing thus far. I'll let ya know how it goes.
