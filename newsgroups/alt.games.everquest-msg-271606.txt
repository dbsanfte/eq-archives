I rarely give a starting character much of anything. I might put
regular cloth or leather gear on them if I just want to get the toon
to 5th level quickly, then take it to a city and game.

I've seen some toons with uber gear in the glooming deep mines.
Absurd.

stone throw using endurance at first, and a will heal at 10th. Since
bind wounds only works up to 70 percent, having that other heal at
10th to take it the rest of theway up is nice. Long time between
uses.
