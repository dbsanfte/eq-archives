    When the succor point is in the right place, it rocks. :-)

    Well, to be fair the AA Archery abilities allowed them to do damage
comparable to what they did inside melee range before. Prior to this, it
just wasn't a viable way for them to fight even though it was intended that
it should be.

    You picked a particular base class ability where NO class has much going
for it in Luclin. Look at other things you do, like nuking and buffing. You
do get AA crits, you do get AA buff length extension, you do get AoE buff
ability. The stuff is out there.

    Aegolism, aye. The biggest reasons for not using PotG:

(1) HPs save lives. Aegolism gives more HPs than PotG. PotG stacks with
Symbols, but for ease of buffing most go with Aegolism. It doesn't help that
the group form of the cleric's best Symbol, Marzin's Mark, drops only off a
very tough mob as part of its loot table.
(2) Stacking issues. It doesn't stack with a cleric's self-only mana regen,
or a mage's self-only mana regen. So those classes won't want it. Since
isolating the classes that DO want it can be a hassle, it just isn't cast.

    The druids in our guild scuttle for cover when the AoE Aegolism is about
to be cast, so I know it has value. It's just that without Marzin's Mark in
wide circulation, it's a hassle trying to get it on the right people.

    Heh, the CR/FR buff was the best in game. No reason to make CoS stack
with other straight CR/FR buffs for that very reason.
