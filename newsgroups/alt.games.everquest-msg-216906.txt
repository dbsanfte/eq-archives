I've found tank-heavy to be  agreat way to go, too, but have had great 
luck with 2 other group combinations: The first was all 43-47- Ranger 
(me), Paladin, Rogue, Enchanter, Druid, Cleric. We took a collection in 
Rujarkian Hills and managed to completely clear the zone.
The second was Ranger, Druid, Cleric, Warior, Beastlord, Bard, all 44-
47. We got a mission to kill 50 in Mistmoore, and completed with just 
shy of 30 minutes left.

High DPS is important, but I've found Pacify/mezz is nice to keep crowd 
control. No matter the combination, LDON is the best thing Sony has ever 
done for EQ.
