Its specifically there to make it hard for people to hack. I suspect anyone
good at hacking can get around it easily enough,  (EQW?). maybe if enough
people dropped their subscription Verant might sit up and take notice, but
most are too attached to their chars and will just suck it up (like me),
like so many other things we have to put up with in EQ. I would almost
certainly have a second account if I could multitask, so thats 1
suvbscription Verant is killing off with this. EQ2 better be totally feakin
awesome if they want me to put up with no multitasking, cos I bet most of
the competition wont cripple my PC.
