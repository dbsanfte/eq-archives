I don't think that's really the issue.  I think the terms 'liberal' and 
'conservative' have meanings that are just as meaningful outside of the 
narrow confines of modern politics.  The OED cites liberal as having been 
used in english as early as 1375, and conservative in 1384 (by Chaucer, no 
less.)  To get back to NT times, we might have to look in a different 
language, for terms that translate to that, but the meaning would still be 
relevant.

Yuh.  The 'state arranging his funeral' bit was done, too.  True, they 
nailed him to a stick instead of a lethal injection, but ya gotta make 
allowances for the available technology, don't ya.

Naw, I hired a speechwriter.  If you object to anything, blame him. :)
