	I've yet to run into a group willing to let a DoN geared knight tank in 
RSS. That's gear one expansion ahead and it doesn't cut it :P

	Not that I'm actually complaining, but you wanted the example. Also, I 
think a DoN geared tank would have no trouble tanking RSS if slower & 
healer were willing and able to adjust playstyle to suit. The problem 
isn't RSS vs DoN gear, it's the whining uberguilders who play in RSS.

	Yes, I said whining uberguilders. You know, the guys whos gear craps on 
mine but who quit after one wipe because they're used to not wiping on 
single group content.

cheers,
Kul
