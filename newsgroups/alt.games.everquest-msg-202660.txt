    A lot of the gear my twinks wear is stuff with recommended levels above
their current level. Except with weapons, where the recommended level thing
can really reduce the effectiveness, usually the reduced stats on a recom.
item still beat out the stats on a no limits item. Add in how worn effects
aren't reduced by recom. levels and those items really come out ahead.
