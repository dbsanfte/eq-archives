Ok, we both agree that druids and shamman cannot heal as well as a
cleric... and we both agree that a cleric cannot port, slow, damage
shield or stat buff (str, dex, cha,etc Not AC HP).

We each have our place... Clerics as the Prime Healer...  Shammans as
the prime debuff/Buffer, Druids the Prime Jack of all trades....

You mention when you fail you dont have the handy rez... if your a
druid, you got SoW, and ports to get back to corpse quick....  A
cleric dies and is not bound close by.... whoot what f'ing fun....
sure I can rez when I get back... but look at the down time...

Facts are Facts.... Clerics are the best healer... it is their entire
job..   Shammans are better buffers/debuffers.... druids are druids..

good hunting to you
