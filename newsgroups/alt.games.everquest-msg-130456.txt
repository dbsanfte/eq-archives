And the next day, they were invaded.  Remember, though, that there were Jews
living in the areas that are now arab lands.  All that was done, was a
division of the areas into specific nations.  I'm sure the Transjordanians
didn't mind taking former Jewish property.  Also, those that lived in the
area that is now Isreal could have remained.

None the less, since there is so much outcry about Isreal's "violating"
international agreement, why is it that they are not even given the right of
existing by those agreements?  The West Bank was legally granted to Isreal
when both Isreal and Jordan was created.  Where is the outcry that Jordan
violated international agreement when they attacked the West Bank?

Palestine has a homeland, it's called Jordan.  Tell them to go home.
