Closer to most.  And depending on the PK,  not so secretly.

Oh, and IMHO "religious experimentation" is very healthy, at least for
an adult or near-adult.  Someone who has never doubted the beliefs they
hold is much easier to shake than someone who has gone through a period
of personal challenge and/or doubt and found truth through that.

Personally comparing the emptiness and desperate hunger for truth of
MOST of the neo-pagans I've encountered to the occasional bouts of
hypocricy from those who claim Christianity.  Not to say that there
aren't people who are lost or hungry that claim Christianity, Just my
experience is that there are fewer, and my exploration of "alternative"
religious groups left me empty and hungry.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when

apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
