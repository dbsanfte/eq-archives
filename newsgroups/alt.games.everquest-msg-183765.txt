    Most of the names I've seen touted here as being "original" are just
based on more obscure references than the "boring, unoriginal" names. If
someone wants to fool themselves into thinking that copying a name from an
obscure book is more "original" than copying a name from a well-known book,
that's their business. I was amused that this player had a specific plan for
his character: to level it up, and to get the paladin archetype AA title
(Sir), at which point he would literally be Sir Notappearing Inthisfilm.
