Is that actually true?  I have more HP than every ranger and rogue in my
guild (some are very close, however) - and were all at a similar level, gear
wise.

And you say this from the experience of a level ___ monk?

Btw both my weapons (the best 2 in the luclin expansion) were H2H, and a lot
of the weapons in PoP I've seen so far are all h2h.  Don't assume H2h means
"weaponless" because its a very bad assumption

I either take no damage on pulls, or I get an ass-kicking on pulls.  There
isn't really an in between.  If i take no damage, regen is moot.  If I take
an ass kicking, I generally need every last HP in order to complete the
pull.

Iksar or Human, AA regens and items or not, regen just isn't an acceptable
method of HP restoration.  I can either sit on my ass for 30 mins while I
wait to regen to complete the pull, I get a cheal, or somebody runs out and
heals me.
