Click on the pot itself.  It will slide aside. :)

Btw, if you can pacify the seahorses at the top of the pit, and -then- 
invis, this will be much easier.  I've seen 4 non-see-invis seahorses 
spawned, but very rarely.  Your best bet is probably tagging along with 
someone who's actually planning to kill Phinny, and grabbing the piece 
while they're busy.  I can verify that Phinny is soloable by a 65 Enc, 
although I did have to gather mana.  I've heard wizards and druids at 
least can manage this as well.  Just ask around among 50-60ish bards, 
wizards, and mages.  You're sure to find someone who still wants their 
epic. :)
