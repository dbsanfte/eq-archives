Well known, well researched, high quality PRNG's exist with
*extremely* long periods.  Assuming each player gets a unique
instance of a PRNG which is seeded when they connect, there's
no way they could stay connected to an EverQuest server long
enough to exhaust that paricular instance of the PRNG.

Re-seeding is simply not required.  Period.  End of story.

Anecdotal evidence supports the conclusion that EQ's PRNG algorithm
is more streaky than it should be.  They're either using a crappy
algorithm or they *want* their PRNG to be streaky.
