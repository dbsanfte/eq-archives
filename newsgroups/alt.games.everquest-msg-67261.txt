I fully agree.

While the new graphics are nice to look at, I found that turning them off
improved loading and zoning substantially.  Also, I realized that it's not the
graphics that made EQ interesting for me to play, it was the underlying game
that pulled me in.  I have all the graphic options turned off, but i'm running
slightly higher textures.... I like those.

Again, I fully agree.

it's SO nice to walk around in Kurns tower and have little slow down.  I used
to have to turn my clipping all the way down just to move.... now it's much
better.  WW is also much better, all those damn moving trees used to just kill

You don't really need a powerful PC, just a mid range.  But I agree, a lot of
people are upset that the newer engine has just killed them.
