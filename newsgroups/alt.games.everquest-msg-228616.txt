I cast TPP on myself, and then grouped up for an LDoN, specifically 
instructed the cleric NOT to temp me (but I'd be happy to get Heroism 
and a symbol).  A while later, I looked at my buffs (group was buff mad, 
and I was having to click off crap like Acumen in order to make room for 
stuff I wanted) and discovered Shield of Words, and no TPP.  (Oh, and as 
a bonus, no symbol.  Asked the cleric, and he said he thought that Temp 
was the only thing I didn't want!)

TPP duration certainly hadn't expired on its own, only ten minutes or so 
into its 2 hour 30 minute (assuming I'd cast it without my silken mantle 
on) duration.

I killed SoWords and cast TPP and it stuck.

So I'm 99% certain it doesn't stack with SoWords (its vaguely possible 
that my cat reached out and played with my mouse while I wasn't looking 
and clicked it off to annoy me)

If it doesn't stack with SoWords, I'd be very surprised to see it 
stacking with Temp or Aego or Virtue, which include an AC component and 
do not stack with SoWords, or with Phantasmal Armor, Phantasmal Plate, 
Phantasmal Leather, or Phantasmal Chain

Its possible, it would be delightful, but I find it highly unlikely. 
Will cost me 10pp to find out, I guess.
