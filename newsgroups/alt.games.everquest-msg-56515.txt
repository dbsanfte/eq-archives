'Fraid not.  Actually you can use the new patch interface now.  Just click
on testeverquest.com and then click on Advanced.  Choose Standard EQ (I
think it's called...it's obvious when you see it) then exit that window.
You can check mark auto login.

That's my default login program now for regular EQ...even one less click is
an improvement, I think. :)

All it saves you is the time taken to hit OK at the end of the patch screen.
It sure would be nice if they really did do more of a DAOC thing but I'm not
holding my breath.
