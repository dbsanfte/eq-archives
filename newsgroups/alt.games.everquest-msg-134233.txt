There seems to be some debate about that.  I tend to be biased in favor of 
the opinion of Dr. Peter Deusberg, who claims that the virus has in fact 
been isolated.  Mostly because he's one of my former profesors, and seemed 
to have his head screwed on pretty straight... Even if he is more 
convinced than I am that HIV does notcause AIDS.   Partly because the "HIV 
virus doesn't even exist" crowd seems to have an axe to grind.

They are holding very close to these Pasteur Institute rules, so close 
that they ignore any technological advances since 1973, especially as they 
might cost them 1000 pounds.
