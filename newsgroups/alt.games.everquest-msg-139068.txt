 There is no "group bonus", it's a myth. Verant/Sony has repeatedly said this yet
the myth lives on. What "bonus" you might notice is the increase in effiency you
get when grouped with others and work toward a common goal with skills and tactics
that compliment each other. Verant made the game this way on purpose. There are
however, certain ZONES wherein you get an "XP bonus", usually dungeons such as
Runnyeye, Sol and The Hole, but you do not get any sort of additional XP added
simply by grouping with another player, however many that may be. 
 
 A well balanced group of players that work well together, know their particular
roles and do them well can kill much much more than six times what a solo player
can and as a result, see XP rise much faster. That's the bonus, effiency and
playing smart.
