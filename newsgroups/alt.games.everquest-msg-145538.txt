I know my last OT didn't go over too well but this really broke my 
heart.  I get kitty stories emailed to me from a list and one of the 
major contributors sent in an appeal for his cat.  Please read and send 
on any advice you have for this poor guy.  I've laughed and cried with 
his wonderful stories of life with cats and would hate that the saddest 
story I read from him would be the following.

Is anyone able to give some advice to Bill? Please email him directly at
teacher812@aol.com or wtchandler@earthlink.net

Thanks in advance.

Purrs to all,
Flippy.

=======================================================================

Diabetic Cat and Separation Anxiety.

My cat Kingsford has been diagnosed with diabetes.  He has had to visit the
vet twice these two weeks.  Unfortunately, his nature of being stressed out
is making an accurate blood glucose curve difficult, if not impossible to
perform.

Fortunately, he has been reacting well to the two units of insulin I give
him twice a day.  His coat has been improving and he has been grooming
himself
and is more active.  I have become very adept and giving him the injections
of insulin.  I feed him turkey, ham, or even fish from my fish and chips
meal.  While eating, I then inject him in the scruff without ANY trouble.
Talk about Pavlovian response.  Whenever he sees that needle, he thinks it
is snack time. LOL

However, he does not like visiting the vet.  He has come to associate the
vet. with poking and prodding, and more importantly, separation from his
loving owner.  He absolutely does not want to leave my presence and his
comfortable home, or his little buddy Lacey.  He is a creature of habit and
does not like his world to change.  If it changes, his adrenaline goes
through the roof.

I have moved several times and I have always taken him with me.  There is no
way I could part with him.  He has been loyal to me through some very
troubled times and personal crises.  I have diligently put him in his
porta-kennel and taken him with me on my drive across country several times.
As a result, whenever he sees the porta-kennel, he knows something is up.
When I take him to the vet. I use the cage.  When he sees that cage he goes
into full stress mode, with pupils dilated the size of the moon and meowing
with the most pitiful meow that a cat can produce.  He expects a road trip,
and starts meowing up a storm and stressing out worse than Don Knotts, AKA
Barney the Deputy, meeting a pretty girl.  He is not a kitty that takes
change or separation too well.

He does not like the vet. and makes it known.  He sits there in the typical
meatloaf position, put hides as soon as the vet. tech. or vet comes near.
They may be able to poke and prod, but he is on stress overdrive.  This
throws his blood sugar reading so off that the vet. just calls me and tells
me to pick him after one or two readings.  He, in his feline mind, doesn't
understand that the vet. only wants to make him better.  He just wants his
daddy and to get away from those horrible people that poke and prod and work
in the place with lots of strange smells.

Because of this stress, his liver pumps out sugar by the boat load.  They,
the people that poke and prod, can't get a clean or accurate reading because
he does not want to be separated from his father, me.  As flattered as I am
by his loyalty, I am concerned about the inability of to get a good reading.
If I could only figure away to get him relaxed enough so they could get a
good reading.  Maybe I should play soothing music or show him pictures of
pretty young female cats. Wait...that won't work, he is neutered.

The only option is for me to pay for the vet to make a housecall.  But he is
worth it.  He is healthier now with the insulin and is his old self.  He is
on his way to recovery, and I will do what it takes to make him better.
Money is no object. His loyalty and companionship are what matter, not legal
tender.

If you, the readers of Flippy's Cat Page or Emails can give advice, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Anything I can do to make him happier and more
comfortable and able to give an accurate reading would be of great help.  I
try my best, but am at a loss.  This just proves just how finite my
knowledge and capabilities are.  I am not ashamed to admit my limitations.
He is
better but I want him to continue to get better and live out the remainder
of his mortal life in peace and comfort.  I can be reached at
teacher812@aol.com or wtchandler@earthlink.net.

With thanks and appreciation.

Bill Chandler
