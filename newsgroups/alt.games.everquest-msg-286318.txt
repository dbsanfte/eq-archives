Thank you for the information regardng my other post :)

I am curious about something though. Most computers I have checked out
at Best Buy and Circuit City have integrated graphics.  Is this the norm
now for low to medium end computers ?  Is it typical now to have to
disable these "cards" and replace them with dedicated cards in order to
play online games ?  I am very curious about this because I bought a
computer about 7 years ago and had none of the issues I am having now
with trying to find a decently priced computer to play online games on
with a graphics slot that allowes me to play actually play them.
