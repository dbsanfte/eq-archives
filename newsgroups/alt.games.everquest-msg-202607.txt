Wrong, it boils down to "KEI on low level characters adversly affects
the game and the way it is played".

>The Pro-KEI crowd think the opposite, that the game is too tedious and
>boring now and anything that reduces that is GOOD.

If you think the game played as intended is too tedious and boring,
find another game. EQ was a success long before KEI was introduced,
and it will continue to be a success long after this current fix.

Really? EQ is a huge success. A few whiny brats quitting over this
change won't put a dent in EQs profit margin.

You don't know squat about "the business world", and that's putting it
as politely as possible. The biggest "hit" EQ ever took was dropping
support fot Win95 and drastically upping the system requirements. No
other change (including fixing KEI) has had a more drastic effect on
the player base. Hundreds if not thousands of players were locked out
of EQ overnight unless they upgraded. No "firings" took place, and
none of the changes were reversed.

>CEO's hate to have customers upset, especially in bad economic times.  Unless
>Sony EQ can prove this "fix" will bring in more customers to replace
>those who leave, they will be in severe hot water.

They don't have to prove anything. EQ still sustains 400K+ plus
subscribers despite all the "nerfs" implemented in the past, and it is
the success that all MMP online games want to achieve. This change
won't hurt EQ any more than the others over the years. Get over
yourself. Your KIE addiction just isn't that big a deal.

>Hit them in the Sony bureaucracy and they will crumble quickly.

You must be taking some serious drugs, if you think they will take
emails about the KEI change seriously. The fact that it took them this
long to make the change to the high level buff loop-hole clearly
indicates that they have thought through the consequences. (including
your little "cry to the boss" plans).
