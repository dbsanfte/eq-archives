My laptop maker (Toshiba) had the fantastic idea that it would be a
good idea to put the fans on the bottom of the unit which means if you
put it on your lap you block the vents.  If that's the case with your
laptop and you are using it on your lap make sure that you don't cover
any vents on the bottom.  I used to get a piece of wood to rest on my
knee so that the vents wouldn't be covered.
