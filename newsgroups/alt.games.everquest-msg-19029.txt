You mean having a conversation? ;)

Its strange this place... people seem unwilling to back off and there
always seems to be an attitude that if someone said something once
they are not permitted to refute it later or revise their opinions. 

(Theres also a tendency to view any conversational tangent as immediately
relevant and possibly attacking the thread it came from; rest assured
this is meandering boredom at work from me, not a personal attack on
you biz ;) )

Its like people think this is a legislature and we need to vitriolically
defend principles that are written in stone and can never be changed... A
lot of what I scribble is half cocked at the time of scribbling - I certainly
dont draft it, revise it, proof it, subject it to peer review, and then
publish it complete with bibliography.

Its a conversational contribution to a thread with other people I find 
interesting or share an interest with, that I expect to sometimes see feedback
on and can revise, reinforce or refute myself dependant on that feedback...

Whaaaaa..... cant we all just get along?

sui, definitely on a tangent now
