Yes, the bazaar has crazy prices for many items - the easy ability to
connect to lower level players from anywhere quickly and buy off them
drove prices up considerably as suddenly high levels really had no need to
go elsewhere, and the lack of need dropped the bottom out of the interest
of a few hours in Feerott or EK farming silks for high level play so
demand soared for a number of low level items. (It had already gone up
dramatically with addition of a bunch of high level quest and tradeskill
items). The easy to obtain (for them) plat was a better choice than the
large amount of time needed to get stuff - the vendors responded.
