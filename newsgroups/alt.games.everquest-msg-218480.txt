Range is the key, not numbers, if you can get the mobs close
enough you can hit at least 60... cause I personally have counted
60 mob damaged messages on a single Tremor off my cleric's clicky
boots.  I've heard 70 and even 100, but can't personally verify
that.

If you aren't hitting at least 60 out of a really huge mass of
mobs, then you don't have them all in range, PBAOE have a very
small radius. 

Since it costs the same amount of mana to kill 60 as to kill 20,
you want as many as you can get before you drop the bomb, only
caveat is that you have to watch your chanter mana while building
the swarm up, and the more mobs you get the riskier it gets that
a few will get lose and kill the chanter.  For large swarms, I
prefer two chanters, which means more reliable overlap and mobs
that do get loose momentarily have two different targets to
concentrate on
