Oh, I know... I haven't seen Meet the Feebles yet, but I've seen the 
other two, plus The Frighteners (and I have a few friends hard at work 
now on The Return of the King, who have said nothing to dispell PJ's 
reputation as a really nice guy). In my humble opinion, the few places 
where the first and second installments of LoTR fail to meet my 
expectations are those character development moments where subtlety and 
good acting were called for, and instead we got EFX and make-up.

I also have a problem with some of the more apparently arbitrary 
divergences from the book*, but then again, I cannot possibly see the 
movie with the eyes of someone who hasn't read The Lord of the Rings, so 
I'll give PJ the benefit of the doubt on those.
