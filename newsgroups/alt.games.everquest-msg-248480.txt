}Hm speaking as a raid leader for my guild I've never even considered aoe on
}a pull. Maybe I should give it a try when clearing pofear next time. Of
}course not unless both death touching golems are down. ;)

We used to use it al the time when clearing to burrower/THO in the deep.  
Very effective clearing to the invisible bridge in two pulls.  Worked 
pretty well in Chardok too.

You'll also need it when the butterflies spawn in TT event, and in a 
couple of the ring events in PoE.
