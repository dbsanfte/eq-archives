It's as much as I can do to plow thru this newsgroup.  Normally I don't
worry about it because normally I can't play during the day anyway.
And given that I was out of work for an operation, even had I known
in advance, wouldn't have made any difference.

Still would be nice if they put it up in game.... say when you are
"entering the world".  Give you something useful to look at instead
of a blank screen or a graphic.
