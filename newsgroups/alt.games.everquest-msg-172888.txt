Oh my yes.  =)

Wow.  Then he's done... with his geerlock, he's got max skill.  I'm envious.

My phrasing was poor.  What I meant by saving time getting skill-ups is
that, with my hammer, I only need to get to 220 in raw skill to have maxed
out my adjusted skill.  The time savings is in not having to go from 220 to
240.

Yes, that's my understanding as well.

Heh.  From a smithing perspective, that's average... one skill-up every
twenty combines or so.  So if I decide to make a pottery run, I won't be
terribly disappointed.

Heh.  I wish I'd gotten smithing up to 242 using Fine Steel Plate before the
nerf.  At the time, though, smithing seemed like effort without reward.  Who
wants to become a GM smith so you can make that leet AC 19 no-stat
Breastplate?

Yeah, a friend of mine showed me that area.  Non-stop killing, and Sense
Undead made it easy for me to zoom in on the lesser shades.  But only
getting one drop every ten mobs was annoying in the extreme.  While Twilight
Sea was more risky for only a slightly higer drop rate as that corner of
Shadeweaver's, psychologically I felt better getting drops from most mobs.

Thanks for the feedback, Zymool.  =)
