Buying and selling accounts isn't illegal either. Its merely against the 
rules in a video game. For which he risks banishment from the land of 
Norrath, not credit card fraud.

In the case of the original poster, he was presented with a little 
thriving cottage industry of account sales, endless testimonials of 
people who'd successfully done it, both on the site, and in game. Sure 
it was 'against the rules' but it is widely known that SOE's enforcement 
of that rule is completely non-existant. He accepted the risk that SOE 
might ban him, not that he could be defrauded by scammers.

So what? The same logic pattern suggests it would be ok for a mechanic 
to steal your car if you hire him to install a non-emissions-compliant 
exhaust.

No. He bears responsibility for cheating, that's it. He didn't somehow 
waive his right to not be defrauded by scammers.
