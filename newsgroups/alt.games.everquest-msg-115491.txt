|Wow, very nice.

	Thanks -- I'm the only Ranger in my guild who doesn't look like an
explosion at a junk factory though. :-)  (And I don't even want to talk about
the poor Bards....:-)  I'd like to replace the Runed Scout's boots with
Tolan's (Golden Leaf is ugly and I don't like the political issues involved
with my guild's HoT activities), but there's really nothing matching I can use
for the gloves.

	Of course, what I'd really like is Vengeful Mail of the Void or a Ancient
Burrower's Hide Tunic with Onyx Chain arms and legs, but that's just not going
to happen. :-)

|Yea, but you know what?  they are probably putting in enormous hours to get

	I'm sure they had help, but I'm also sure they don't have nearly the time
/played previous Rangers had at their level.

	Well, that's because you're a reasonable person.

	It was way too late in this game to add cultural skills.  Totally unfair
that I should have my character's trade ripped away from him because of an
uninformed decision I made three years ago.
