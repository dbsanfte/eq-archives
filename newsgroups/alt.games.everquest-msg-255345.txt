There comes a time when one must realize no one game is going to be
everything to everyone.

Many times the changes wanted by some segment of the population would
in some way negatively affect either another segment, or in an
indirect way *everyone*.

This is what EQ is. You get better rewards by doing things that
require more people. People who prefer to solo get one level of
advancement, people who group get somewhere further, and people who
raid get somewhere even further.

No single group content is ever going to be challenging to the same
extent that comparable raid content will be, despite 42's protests.
The single group is limited by certain factors like healing power, hp,
and mana, and trying to push them runs into the classic problem of
balancing the classes so the have-not classes don't get left out. You
just can't do it the same way you can customize raid targets.
Therefore those asking for single group content as rewarding as raid
content are simply looking for an *easier* way to the same *loot* or
*advancement*.

And that's all its about for those making that complaint. The content
doesn't get *better* the higher you go; in fact the argument can
easily be made that GoD has some of the worst content in the entire
game outside of VT the way it reuses zones and mobs. No. The complaint
is sheer, raw *envy*. Individual advancement has become everything -
and not advancement for the sake of advancement, but advancement
compared to everyone else.

I think I'll start pointing these casual powergamers in the direction
of Progressquest. It is exactly what they mostly want - see their
numbers go higher for minimal effort expended.
