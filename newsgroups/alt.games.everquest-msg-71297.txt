Irrelevant? Not in the slightest... The Fungi Tunic isn't available
for free to all casters. Meditate is. Thus, I was pointing out how the
comparison was invalid.

So, you heal 300 hp in 140 seconds with the tunic, but only 75-80
seconds with Inner Fire. Med up for the remaining 60-65 (66 to keep
with the ticks) seconds. Mana continues to regen as you fight if
you're not full after 65 seconds. There ya go, keeping pace just fine
with the fungi. Might be a little slower to med to full, but not more
than a minute, tops. Trivial, really.

Of course, this is for lvl 12 and up. Which can generally be reached
painlessly without any twinking whatsoever if you have any idea how to
play the game.

No, I'm pointing out that the tunic doesn't really signifigantly
reduce downtime for someone who knows what they're doing...
