Thanks. A much better clarification of what I was trying to say to Dan,
but didn't quite phrase it as well. He answered my last post with miles
of additional stuff obviously written by somebody who watched too many
hours of Bill Clinton's taped testiomony in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
"What do you mean by the word 'is' sir?"
"Jizz?"
"NO! 'IS!"

Dan has found a way in attempting to defend this position, (as I
predicted *somebody* would in my first post on the topic) by trying to
twist the rules around in some Ally McBeal cartoon of the intent of the
"laws" in this case.

In the specific reference, we are talking about spelling. This is not,
regardless of Dan's repeated attempts to say the same thing over and
over, a matter of debate. Spelling is *pretty well* defined. (There are
exceptions, of course, in slang and regional dialect.) But for the large
part, something is spelled correctly, or it's not. There is no "gray
area" or for you Brits "grey area" on the issue. The phrase in question,
regardles of any denial was "Bigole Titties".  This is obviously bad
grammer as well as slang, but the intent is clear. "Bigole" is a slang
takeoff on stereotypical southern US redneck slang for "Big Old", and of
course, "Titties" would be the really slack rendition of "tits" which
would be the [obscene] version of "breasts".   Put them together, and
you have the slang, bashed up "Bigole Titties". Pretty damn clear unless
you live under a rock or in a Canadian convent.
  Now, change it to "Tigole Bitties".  You've just misspelled it in two
places. The fact that you misspelled it using a letter which had been
used in the other word of the phrase makes it *NO LESS* of a
misspelling! That's like trying to write, "Brown Dog".  If you write
"Vrown Rog" is has been misspelled. Twice. Likewise, if you write,
"Drown Bog", you have *still* misspelled it, no matter how many times
you try to claim that it's also a "spoonerism".  It's either spelled
correctly or not. And if not, it fits within the rules laid down by
Verant. As you so correctly stated... QED.
