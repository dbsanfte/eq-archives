As has previously been mentioned this is the cap for you lvl,
increasing at 5 per lvl to 280 at 65.  AA will enable you to take this
to 355 int/wis & 305 other stats.  Bear in mind by this time you will
be looting a different league of equipment so dont worry how your
going to make it all up.

Protection of Cabbage / Protection of the Nine are druid spells that
add mana regen - generally the preferred combo of buffs for casters is
potn & symbol rather than Virtue at 65.

I don't know what the druid ornate's make, however the caster ones are
pretty poor stats wise with the exception of the MP4 on sleeves.  The
rest can be bettered by LDON purchases which are a lot easier to pick
up.

As a chanter who solo's a lot I swear by my MP4 sleeves.  After that
if you look for focus items which give Casting Haste, Improved Damage
or Improved Range these will all help.

Earring of the solstice should be avaialble in kit form for around
5kpp.  As druid you can do the quest twice, firstly for the Earring of
the Solstice: AC: 5 STA: +5   WIS: +8   INT: +8   HP: +55   MANA: +55 
 SV FIRE: +5   SV COLD: +5   SV MAGIC: +5   Mana regeneration: +1 &
then again for xanthe's earring of nature AC: 5 STR: +8   STA: +8  
WIS: +10   HP: +55   MANA: +55   SV FIRE: +7   SV COLD: +7   SV MAGIC:
+7 Effect: Circle of combines.

Theres also the Coldain Prayer Shawl.  7th shawl will get you FT1. 
Pretty much all of it is soloable, although the kael bit is best
camped in the bazzar & you may need a hand in SG.  The 8th will get
you FT3 but takes a bit more effort & if your Dain faction isn't good
that can be problematic to repair.

If you havn't got one get a horsey or lizard - a cheap one will do. 
They make regening mana a lot easier when your grouped, just dont try
soloing on one!

Good hunting!!
