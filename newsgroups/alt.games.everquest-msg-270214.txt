This is an excerpt of an article from the December 14, 2004 issue of
the Courier Herald, Dublin, GA titled, "Getting a little nerdy",
written by Jason Halcombe, where he talks about the recent CNN story
about video games; the complete story is available at:

====================


Have you ever listened to someone try to explain why they�re not
weird, only to explain even further why they sat alone in the school
lunchroom and are therefore weird? 

Case in point: Every Sunday, in between watching the bevy of NFL
broadcasts, CNN puts on a show called Next. The program is based
around new technology for the home, office, automobile, etc.. 

Anyway, they�re constantly showing stuff about video games, which has
interested me since I was big enough to hold an Atari 2600 controller
in my hand. 

But, instead of talking about the traditional video game systems, they
focused on PC gaming, which happens to be the nerdiest of all forms of
gaming. I mean, really, who wants to have to hold down the P, D, and B
buttons while hitting the CAPS LOCK key repeatedly? 

Give me a joystick and an A/B button any day. 

Well, this lady was big into some game called Everquest. It�s a
virtual-reality game in which people take on the lives of characters
and play in this fantasy world. Kinda like a �Dungeon and Dragons�
version of The Sims. 

This lady (clad with half/inch thick bifocals and barely-combed
shoulder length blond hair) went on to talk about how her character
had arranged and performed several marriages within Everquest. 

The host asked her if she thought that was weird, and here�s what she
said. 

"Well, I just enjoy roaming around in a fantasy world, exploring the
various worlds (yah-ta, yah-ta, yah-ta)." You get my point. Weird. 

I think she needs to spend more time going to
http://abc.go.com/primetime/extrememakeover/index.html. 

Those thousands of dollars she has spent on faster connection times, a
better video card and countless hours of time on the internet could go
toward making a video and getting on Extreme Makeover. 

And here�s what she got:
A tummy tuck.
Liposuction of the hips and inner-thigh.
Dental reconstruction and porcelain veneers.
Lascik eye surgery.
A fresh haircut and color.
New clothes.
A FREAKIN� LIFE. 

Sorry. 

I had to get that off my chest. There�s nothing wrong with playing
video games, but when they keep you from even attempting to have a
life, that bothers me.
