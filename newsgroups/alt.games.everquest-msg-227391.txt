I've heard both. If this banker really exists (in a WELL???), then it's
hard to believe there wasn't an insider, because why the hell would there
be a random banker ina  well in a rarely-used zone?  Occam's Razor would
seem to apply here.

I don't really *want* there to be an inside job, but if the "banker in a
well in befallen" thing is accurate, that's the most likely explanation.
