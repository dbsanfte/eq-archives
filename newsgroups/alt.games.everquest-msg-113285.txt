You obviously haven't played a druid very high.  On the rare occasion
that I turn off anon, being in moderately populated zone for more than
5 minutes will net me at LEAST half a dozen tells asking for SoW,
buffs, Tp's, and most irritating, "Pl me".  And if you bother to turn
down some of these people, a fair percentage will get belligerent.

One time, me and my guild are doing Umbral and I started getting tells
from some ass munch asking me to TP him to GFay.  The guy was in the
Nexus.

No, sorry.  I'm staying anon with my druid.  Call me arrogant, I
really don't give two shits.

Yeah, but that's what they made Superior Camouflage for.
