Yes, it's exactly the same model as the adventuring model, but most people 
don't notice the requirement of experience since the class transition 
requires a quest and the tradeskill transition does not. The class quest 
provides the needed experience automatically but since you don't quest for 
tradeskilling advancement, you're left having to get the experience by 
crafting one more item.
