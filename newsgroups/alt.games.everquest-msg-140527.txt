Umm no. Its 10. Its been 10 since EQ has been live.
The formula is well known. For INT/WIS 200 or less:

Mana For Priest classes(Druid, Cleric, Shaman, Rangers, Paladins):

 ((WIS/5)+2) x Level or

Mana For Int Casters (Necromancers, Mages, Enchanters, Wizards, Bards, Shadow Knights):

((INT/5)+2) x Level

(The +2 bonus is so that newbies get a little boost in mana)
So if you are level 50 and have 200 INT/WIS your mana is 2100.
(barring any +mana items of course)
Which is 10 mana per INT/WIS point + the newbie (+2) factor
for the extra 100.

When adding gear though you must ignore that +2 newbie bonus since
everyone gets that and when you are adding +INT/WIS gear you are
getting an 'additional' 10 mana not 10.5.

Lots of tests have been run on it. General concensus I have seen
on the caster borads is that it is a sliding scale but that 5.8 was
a good approximation to use.
