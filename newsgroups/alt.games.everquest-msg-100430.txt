I'm really curious about this...

Based on past issues the next 2 years MIGHT contain...

3 more expansions... 'Planes' being one of them (EB has it penciled in for
Oct release)
2 more DX upgrades... DX9 is due sometime this autumn/fall... and DX10(?)
with another version of Windows sometime late next year
At least one more major hardware revision/upgrade  (prolly for
DX10/WinXP2... or whatever the next Microsoft OS is called)

On the other hand, EQ might shut down in another 12-18 months. In which
case, would we get to transfer the remaining credit to EQ2 or whatever?
