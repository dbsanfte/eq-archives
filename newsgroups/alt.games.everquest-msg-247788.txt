   I don't think so.  Right now, you can't even open and close new chat
windows at all, or create even in server chat channels.  Compared to EQ as
it currently is, it seems a bit primitive.

   But then, how long did it take EQ to add these things?  If CoH remains
popular, I have a feeling these things may come.
