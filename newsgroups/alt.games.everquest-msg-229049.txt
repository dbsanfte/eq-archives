I've been playing EQ for about 3 years, believe me, I have learned to live
with the grief. I just don't happen to be one of the numerous SOE apologists
on this newsgroup.  Many people have jobs where such spotty workmanship
would not be tolerated, somehow it's the norm with EQ.

Just by chaos theory, they'd almost have to do a patch right the first time.
I mean a thousand monkeys with a thousand typewriters, given a thousand
years, would eventually type something meaningful.

SOE is surprisingly consistent with their inability implement a patch well
or on time. It's really quite astounding.

Glad I could grace the world with these thoughts. Happy holidays, Bizbee.
