Sounds like both parties were out of line and forgot how to be polite for at
some point during this, maybe your message was unclear or they found you to
be insulting first and maybe just maybe they took offence. Text messages
have no emotions and have to be extremely clear.

Been in crush with my high leveler for the same reasons simply buffed the
lower levels heavily then asked if they would allow me to loot the no drop
peices I need......no one ever said no as they wanted XP (its an xp zone in
general like PC) and greatly appreciated the buffs, all said and done its
just a game
