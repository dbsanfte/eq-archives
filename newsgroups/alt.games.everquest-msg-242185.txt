Hi gang,

Please bear with me as I try to explain this...  It is confounding me at every
turn.  :(

Saturday I was able to run patcher and log into EQ normally.

Sunday a.m. I was able to run patcher and log into EQ normally.

Sunday afternoon I played a bit of Zoo Tycoon Complete and for some reason Zoo
Tycoon had a meltdown.  (I was not connected to internet at the time btw...)
and after it crashed I said screw it and watched some TV. I did not go back
online or try to log into EQ again on Sunday.

Monday morning I got up and ran patcher normally.  I got to the screen and
entered my password and then it all went to hell.  As soon as I entered my
password and hit Connect (or Enter) as is my habit, EQ started this laborious
crawl...  It took a full 7 minutes to get from the point of entering password
to the point of selecting my server.  Once the server select screen came up, it
took another full 4 minutes to be able to hit the Play button in order to
connect to the server.  From there, another 5 min later and I got the 1017
Error and then my entire computer froze. 

I had to use the power button to shut down the computer because I couldn't even
cntrl/alt/dlt out.  

Now I understand that correlation does not equal causation, but I'm wondering
if my Zoo Tycoon meltdown could be part of the problem.  :(

I am running Win XP on a dial up *ick* modem using AOHell for my ISP.  I know,
already many of you see problems with this, but I swear until yesterday it was
still livable...  LOL

I have tried to reconnect 3 times more and each time the above process has been
repeated.  I have defragged and still no help.

Now I have run a System Restore to set me back to Saturday when the computer
ran ok.  Here's hoping this helps.  :(  Any advice would be much appreciated...

Thanks gang,

Joolz
