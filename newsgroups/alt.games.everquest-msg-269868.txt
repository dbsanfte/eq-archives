Yeah, you have a good point there and I may ultimately opt to do that. I 
was thinking maybe I'd move the Druid to my primary account tho and the 
warrior too and just hang on to them where one is geared so well and the 
other has his epic. I could play the same toons up from level 1 to a 
point where I felt comfortable switching over to the higher toons and in 
the case of the Druid it would save me doing the epic 1.0 and allow me 
to jump into epic 1.5 right away with him, saving a few steps on it. 
Part of my reasoning there is that they have some nice nodrop stuff.

I also thought about hanging on to the other account and using the 
chanter as a buff bot for my other toons. Free KEI, VoQ or Tranq. 
whenever I want it for any of my toons would be nice. Being able to cast 
in pok for donations might be a nice way to make a little plat too. I'd 
have to try it and see if that was worth doing or not. Then again, 13 
bucks a month for that is kind of expensive and transferring the 
characters is expensive too, not to mention renaming them for yet 
another fee. I'd want my own identity ingame. It would be pretty sweet 
though to park the chanter at the wos zone in and whenever my group 
wipes being able to hit all with mind candy and then HP/AC buffs with my 
cleric. I don't know about you guys but wiping at wos seems to be a 
pretty frequent thing and fast complete recovery would be sweet.

I don't know. I'm still thinking it over.
