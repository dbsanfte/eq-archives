Oh, you mean that barbarian in the middle of the wilderness?  *spit* 
Bah.  I trekked out into that frigid hell just to see him, managing to 
avoid the kill-all-Iksar-on-sight types.  I thanked my luck when I found 
Starn or Stern or whatever his stupid softskin name is... and then found 
out that my coin wasn't good enough for him!  Feh!  And feh again!

*sulk*

Fortunately, a passing Vah Shir shaman was heading there as well and was 
kind enough to purchase an extra scroll of Sicken for me.  Proof again 
that the true nobility among softskins have fur and tails.
