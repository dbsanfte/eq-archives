 Turns out I had one piece of NToV stuff. Who could forget good ole
Vulak. I'm going to miss him! Before that I had a Dain crown so that's
not a big jump in ac. 15 more plus whatever you get from 10 agi.

Head - Brother Xaves Headband (45)
Ear - Dragon Blood (10) , Sarnak (5)
Neck - Harla Dar's Talisman (7)
Face -  Enshrouded Veil (7)
Finger - Dain Ring 9 (9), Velium Diamond (6)
Bracer - Shackle of Tynnonium (12), Bracer of Fortitude (12)
Arms - Hardened Grey Flesh (16)
Hands - Celestial Fists (15)
Shoulders - Poisoned Mantle (15)
Back - Cloak of the Fearsome (15)
Chest - Golden Star Chest Wraps (23)
Waist - Spider Fur Belt (8)
Legs - Golden Star Pants (11)
Feet - Barbed Dragonscale Boots (19)
Range - Vex xi Vius (25)


So that leaves a room for a few updates off the top of my head:

Neck - Silent Fang (20)
Face - Ancient Pirates Eyepatch (20)
Bracer - Dragon Skin (25), Tormax (20)
Arms - Ancient Wyvern Hide (25)
Chest - Ancient Wyvern Hide Tunic (40)
Waist - Belt of the Destroyer (25)
Legs - Ancient Wurm Hide Greaves (46)
Feet - Boots of the Destroyer (28)

 Looks like I need to camp Dagarn a little more! That's 134 more than my
present equipment. Along with some of the other items that can be
upgraded along the way.
