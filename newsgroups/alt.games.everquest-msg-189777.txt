: Wow... Am I getting the best of both worlds here.  Just wondering on what
: class some of you guys would pick for someone that isn't to great at
: computer games but would have me there to help.  Thanks for any help you
can
: give

I've brought alot of friends into this game.  Some have enjoyed it, some
have not, but regardless I always suggest a melee type.

I started a warrior first.  A big ugly ogre to be exact.  I took him to 23
levels before starting my next character and in that 23 levels I learned a
lifetime worth of 'donts' that the support classes tend to do.  Being a
warrior broke me of any bad habits I could have had before I even started my
other characters.  Its been often commented on (just an example) how nice it
is that my cleric / wizard / necro does not run but trusts in the tanks to
get the mob off me.

Its just a suggestion and she's got an advantage that alot of us didn't have
starting out.  She's got you to help her with whatever class she chooses.
