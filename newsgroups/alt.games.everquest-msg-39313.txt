Don't know if you found thsi info yet, but to get the bracers of the revenent,
go to North karana by the Undead tower near the druid circle and start killing
all the undead there. Then use your sense undead to find a mob called ZAHAL THE
VILE.  Once Zahal spawns, I believe a 4 hour pop kill him, then IMMEDIATELY run
north west I think to the bridge that goes to west Karanas. Once there hit your
sense undead. You will see a ghoul called Regis the Revenent Ghoul.  Kill it
and loot the flute. Take that flute to a lady in the rhathe mountains in the
gypsy camp, I forget her name, but Alakazahms should have it. She will give you
the Ingot of the Revenent. Take the Ingot, the Icon from Zahal, and an
Enchanted 2 Bars of platinum to Gavil the Temperent in the Temple of Sol Ro, he
will forge them into a bracer of the revenent for you.

Regards,
