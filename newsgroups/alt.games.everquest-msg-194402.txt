I have said that they are not that great and of limited use.
Spokem from the point of view of someone who has a bard as their first
chr and so far taken it to lvl 34.

Too much is written by people who are too high and have forgotten some
of the basics for a newbie; e.g. hot links to actions, songs and
weapons. The hot link is not really to the song or weapon, but to the
slots in inventory and/or song bar. So the link becomes whatever is in
the slot/spot. Big difference in understanding and it explains why I'm
forever having to explain it to other newbies. (actually a critique of a
lot of sites).

So you get a guild for level 30's that after saying little, suddenly
starts talking about lvl 40+ songs (real useful not). It is obviously
someone desperately trying to remember what it was like. 

However, I do thank the people for taking the time to write even that
much, because I have taken a little bit from it and worked a lot of
stuff out.

The functionality of these sites isn't too good either. More times then
not, I'm stuck looking at a lvl 55-60 guide and can not get to the
desired lower level.

Personally, I prefer usenet.  All that is lacking for me is a decent
usenet storage to carry out searches.

This AA discussion is an example. Doesn't affect me atm, and not likely
to for a while (the plateau in levels until I can link up with another
group), but still handy to know for the future.
