I'm waiting for the bit where you tell me why I should care....

No subject is being changed. I find myself wondering why I am arguing
with someone who doesn't even know what they are talking about, let
alone me. But we see below why that happens, as Twohead flouts his
ignorance for the world... don't worry, we're getting to that.

See above. Self awareness is your friend. Learn it.

Uh oh, hints of why he's in trouble. We're almost there....

Apparently you have no idea what "exactly meant for" means, either.
The channel is meant to catch the very sort of things the people werre
talking about. What about that don't you understand? English not your
first, second, or third language?

Wrong again, Twhead! At this rate you need a third.

And here it is! The source of Twohead's problems.

No, it doesn't mean exclusivity at all. So your excuse is you don't
understand English. I'll remember that. *sigh*

Person 1: They're skating on ice!
Person 2: Of course, that's exactly what its there for.
Twohead: You idiot! Exactly means exclusively! Ice has other uses
besides being skated on!
Everyone else: /laugh at Twohead

Don't worry, no apology is expected, despite it definately being
deserved.

Your lack of general understanding amuses me.

People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

And there's that old self awareness problem kicking in again....
