    OK, THIS I have to take issue with. Did they really have a crappier
weapon than you? Were they just not getting any double attacks off, which
you don't do? Were they not taunting, so they didn't Riposte? They were
casting damaging stuns between swings and not resetting the swing counter -
did YOU do that? Were you even hitting as often and for as much possible
total damage, with your lower ATK rating? They've likely invested in a haste
item, like an FBSS - did you have one? Oh, and how did you make up for not
having the primary hand damage bonus that they do?

    I know you liked meleeing, and your pop-up method was innovative and
non-damaging to the group. But outdamage the melees, with melee? Unless you
were with poorly-equipped, and I mean REALLY poorly-equipped paladins, I
just don't believe you. Unless.... you are someone who has fallen for the
fallacy of the large hit. That used to be the downfall of the "melee shaman"
before Kunark - "Look how hard I'm hitting with my Gatorsmash Maul! I'm
rocking!" Then you'd point out how rarely they swung, and how often you'd
hear that big "whoosh" sound as they whiffed....
