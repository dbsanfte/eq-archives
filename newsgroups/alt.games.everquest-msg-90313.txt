Come to think of it, let me amend myself here...

The exception, of course, is when people are sitting
around the zone line.  Then you have no choice, and
it's their fault for sitting on the train tracks.
But then you should at least call out a warning on
your way out.

This doesn't apply to the Oasis situation being discussed,
though, because the docks are about as far from the zone
lines as anything in the entire zone.
