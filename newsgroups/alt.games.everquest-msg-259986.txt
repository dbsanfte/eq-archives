Heck, I can go one better.  I'm pretty sure, from watching for it,
that it's possible to get skillups vs ANY mob, even if it doesn't
have a weapon!

So sure, you could just find a level 1 mob and spend an hour
mashing your disarm key, or just get in the habit of mashing
the key whenever it pops up during a battle.  Or, if you want
to do it vs greens, make it useful!  I took my Iksar into
Runnyeye to build up faction with the Rivervale druids (and
that annoying Ella Foodcrafter chick in Misty :-), and I found
I could usually hit autoattack, disarm, flying kick, and about
that point the green would be dead, but I'd have gotten one
disarm attempt in.  I'm at Disarm 144 now.

Not that Disarm seems to be good for much, especially as it
never works on magic weapons.  Though I admit I did get it to
succeed against a giant High Priest during a Ring War today. :-)
And I got two skillups during that same war!
