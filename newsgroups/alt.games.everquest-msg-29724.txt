I was able to solo low red and yellow giants and griffons in NK with
my Druid and my gear was average at best. It wasn't xp effecient--just
fun.

My main tactic was

1. Snare giant/grif
2. Find a grifenne on track and run to it.
3. Charm the grifenne
4. Cast feral spirit on pet
4. /pet attack
5. Cast high taugh spells like flame lick and careless lighting
getting the giant/grif to chase me while the grifenne clawed it to
death.
6. If charm breaks I would run ahead and re-charm/buf the grifenne.

Another tactic was to use fear/stinging swarm (griffs) or
root/stringing swarm (giants) however I usually needed clarity to have
enough mana to kill the high yellow/low reds.

If I had my Warden Symbol of Tunare back then, I would have been able
to do it without clarity.
