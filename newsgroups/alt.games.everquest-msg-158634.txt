FWIW, that's how the game treats Charmed PCs. They get an "LD" tag appended
to their name, then they run around beating up on you :/

I've run into that quite a few times in Splitpaw myself. Best thing you
can do (after killing those annoying 'chanter gnolls) is keep the charmee
mezzed til it wears off. Unfortunately, in my experience, when it wears
off, the PC immediately goes *real* LD as well, but that is likely a bug.

I vote you were right, but I tend to be more sanguine about dying than
some. You might next time decide with your group ahead of time who is
responsible for scrubbing the combat.

Also, warriors in particular, you'd think, would be a little more used to
dying in a combat snafu because they don't have much in the way of escape
abilities. But maybe he was a newb who'd been lucky to never be in that
position before...
