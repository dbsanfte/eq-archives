We have a beautiful memorial to the Japanese that were hurt because of the
detention camps, during the war.  It is an apology for what we did.  I bring
exchange student down to see it and to walk around and read all the plaques.
I've had about seventy Japanese exchange students over the years.  Ones from
other countries, have stayed here as well, even one from Israel.
No evil is justified.  No hate is good.  No killing is right.
It is a horror whether a jew or a palestinian is killed.  It is horrible to
see only what you want to see and not understand why others are hurting.
