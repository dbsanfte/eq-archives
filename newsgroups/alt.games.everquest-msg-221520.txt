I think this is a great idea. I happen to work with PHP and HTML all
day long, so I'd love to help out with the general framework. (I'm a
programmer and have been doing this for years - so I claim to kinda
know what I'm doing). I also happen to be running a small hosting
start up with a few friends on the side, so I could host the website
(DNS, Mail, Database, Web) and all that good stuff (if we can keep the
traffic to managable levels). If you have a domain name in mind I can
have it set up in just a couple days. I also have some mostly unused
domains we could use.

Email me sometime and we'll get it set up.
