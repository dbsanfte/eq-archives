I have been playing DAOC for about 10 days. I had a lvl 57 druid and
several other char in the 30's on Xegony. I will probably not be back
to EQ.

DAOC is very similar to EQ, the biggest difference I notice is in
playing time.
There is little down time in DAOC, there is little time wasted going
out to find things that you will need to play. No traveling across the
continent to find a merchant to buy spells, for example.
There are more groups who can solo, and still have a role in groups.
DAOC is not as "real" as EQ, but is a lot more playable.
