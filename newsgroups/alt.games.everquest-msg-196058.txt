I've posted plenty of times to a.g.e, I was simply pointing out some things
to lance.  Resisted less?  Hardly, disease based slows are far superior to
magic based ones.  Oh and illusion potions don't bother me at all....If a

necessary to make those, go ahead.  Let me know why you think shamans
"aren't" the most powerful class in EQ and we can chat some more.
