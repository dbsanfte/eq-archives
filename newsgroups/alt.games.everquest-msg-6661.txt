Well, these numbers are real. I would really like to see something 
similar for a paladin or SK before I believed it

And why half a year ago people thought that wizards were kings of 
damage? Or why people thought rogues were useless? Monks can take damage 
better than paladins and SKs. It's difficult for them to be a primary 
tank in an experience group because they can't taunt. In a single pull 
situation it's not a problem, but breaking mezzes without taunt wears on 
the enchanters

> Because in reality they aren't as good.

In reality the earth is flat too. I mean look at it, it's flat! I don't 
care what your numbers show, but it looks flat
