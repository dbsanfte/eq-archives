I don't know about everyone, but I see a big difference between being earned
by the Necro57 and the Ranger12 on the same account.  If the Necro gives
something to the Ranger, fine.  The Ranger, however, shouldn't brag about
those items because 'he' hasn't earned them.
The issue really isn't the twinking, it's the charade of a lower level
character pretending that just because another character did all the work
that the lower character has 'earned' it.

I've accepted gifts in my career, most of us have.  You won't hear me
boasting about anything I've been given, though.  You'll hear me saying how
wonderful Soandso is.
