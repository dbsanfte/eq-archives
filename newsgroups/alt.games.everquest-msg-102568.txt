Used to be quite a few of them in EC when I first started playing there,
guess whoever was doing it gave up on it.  Couldn't stand it every few mins
shouts of "Gambling at Shady, Come to Shady for an honest deal" and to top
it all off, I had NO IDEA what they were talking about, very frustrating.
Only figured it out because I happened to go through the tunnel one time and
saw the guy standing there.
