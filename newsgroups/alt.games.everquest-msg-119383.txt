Forest Giants in Warsliks woods, can kite them easily, even the red
Evergreens (be careful though on that), drops the normal assortment of
Kunark giant weapons/armor and decent coinage, also a chance for a forest
loop, though rare, I went from 22 to 26 or so on them and got no loops.

Of course, they're usually uncamped on EVERY server =p, and it does depend
whether or not your computer chokes in that zone.
