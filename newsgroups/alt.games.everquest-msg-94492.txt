At level 4, there is no safe way IMHO, but, if you want to explore, here's a
way to do it:

West Freeport to East Commonlands then to West Commonlands.  If it is
daylight, then you are good to go.  WC to Kithicor Forest, hugging the right
wall until you come to the cave to Rivervale.

Rivervale takes you to Misty Thicket (stop for a while in RV and chat with
the soulbinder, then hunt for a few levels in Misty Thicket - one of the
best if not THE best newbie zone on the "mainland".)

Misty Thicket to Runneye (hug the right wall in Runny and you will exit
safely), Runny takes you to the Gorge of King Xxorb.  Stay on the left wall
there and run.  Eventually, you will come out at East Karana.

Run South until you see the river, then follow with river on your right till
the Wood Bridge.

Cross bridge.

Welcome to North Karana.  Run south.  Try not to die.  Die anyway.  Come
back.  Run south to river, keep river on your left.  Go past the Stone
Bridge, zone into West Karana.  Run some more.  Run alot, keeping the river
on your left the entire time.

Run into a cliff/zone wall.  Keep that on your left, run some.  Are you
still running?  Good.  Run again.  Run till you see a valley of sorts, enter
valley.

Welcome to Qeynos Hills.  Follow path to Qeynos.  Voila.

P.S.  You can stop running now.
