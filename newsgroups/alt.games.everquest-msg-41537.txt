Well, no one has reached level 50 yet, and the frontiers have just now
gone in, so any claim by beta testers that you can get to 50 without
going into the frontiers (ie, engaging in PvP), is just them restating
what Mythic has been saying their goal is. The fact is, no one knows if
this will turn out to be the case or not.

You haven't heard anyone complain about power loss because Relics and
real frontier PvP are not in yet (unless they've just gone in in the
last day or so).
