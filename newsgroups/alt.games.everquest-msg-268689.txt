Yeah, I was using intimidate at times on my berserker, but I didn't get 
nearly as big a boost out of it as a rogue would.  Snare though.... no 
snare, no stun, has to be pretty annoying to fear kite a full speed mob?

I have to agree, if a rogue can, any class can; certainly every class I 
played could, and the only ones I left out were rogue and paladin.  I 
was pretty sure paladin would work decently, rogue was my only holdout 
for the "its just not worth doing" flag.
