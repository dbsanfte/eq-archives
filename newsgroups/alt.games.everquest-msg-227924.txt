Echoing what pretty much everyone else has said, wis is one of those
things you should treat as a bonus.  Don't seek it out, as your mana
pool just isn't that important in most situations.

Also don't forget dexterity.  At the lower levels it is important if
you have procing weapons, if you want to become a fletcher, and to
learn weapon skills.  At higher levels, you will want to keep it maxed
for archery.  In most cases, I would place dexterity above strength in
importance, but under hitpoints/stamina.

One more thing: a lot of Rangers theorize that AC really isn't that
important, at least past level 40 or 50 when complete heals make
hitpoints king, unless you can get AC really high.  The theory, I
believe, is that there is a point where your armor class actually
matters.  Anything below that point and the mob will hit you nearly as
hard no matter whether your AC is 1000 or 100.  Breaking that point is
very difficult.

However, this target AC level is determined by mob level.  If you are
looking to avoid damage from mobs around your level or above it, AC
won't help a Ranger nearly as much as it will help a plate class tank.
 If you are looking to avoid damage from mobs several levels below
your level, perhaps AC does help quite a lot.  That is how I
understand things.  In any case, I tend to favor hitpoints over armor
class no matter what.  For my AA's, I tried to max out hitpoints
before I bothered with defensive skills.  AC may be slightly more
important to me, personally, than strength, just for those cases when
I am fighting lower level stuff for farming purposes, epic fights, or
what have you.

I haven't tested anything and I operate only on what "they" say, so
take this all with a grain of salt.
