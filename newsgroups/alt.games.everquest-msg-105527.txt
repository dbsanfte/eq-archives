I was in OT last night PL'ing my now 31 Vah-Shir warrior with my 54 druid
and steady pulling yellows at least and reds preferably and getting no more
than just barely above a blue per kill, now my question is this, I was
taking on things that were light blue to my druid with my warrior (I made
sure we were not grouped) and seemed that the "redness" didnt seem to matter
as I got the same amount of exp for something red to me but green to my
druid as things that were light blue to my druid but red to me (bring on the
tigers) is there a "exp cap" where after a certain level mob the xp does not
get any higher?
I'm at a loss
