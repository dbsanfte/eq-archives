    His objective seems to be to get a higher-level necromancer. His
objective is not to sit at the keyboard, staring at his spellbook, waiting
for the next spawn to be up. He has more useful things to do. However, that
is what he must do to level up UNLESS he can find a spawn with the
properties he listed. Then he can go do whatever he wants, even play his
main on a second computer, while the XP ticks in.

    Irony: someone who wants you to stare at a spellbook on screen for hours
on end telling you to "get a life".
