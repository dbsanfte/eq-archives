Which is not always true.

Level 50 for me:

One and one half yellow from doing turn ins for my  epic.
(1 + 1/2 yellow for turning in notes!)

3 Yellows in Hate and Kedge and Kael (gotta love
being a rogue...KS Group! ;-)  ), and this was including
3 or  4 deaths (with rezes,though, I'll admit).

Last 1/2 yellow in the Dreadlands.

You can't always point to the zone and say "idiots
there."  Except LoIO.
;-)
