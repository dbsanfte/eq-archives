As a bard Id like to point out here most non bards only think we know
mana song, and other than pulling I dont think they would notice if we
just stood there. In fact, in a poll most people I grouped with didnt
even have the bard song window up, and so would ask for a song I was
already singing, thus proving they couldnt even tell it was going on..
so wouldnt probably miss it if I didnt.

Im not saying bards are uber or need improvement, but I do think
theres a lot out there people are blind to and only education can
help, Im not sure giving monks a lull is a way of educating or just a
random answer - after all, if people worked in a proper team there
would be a cleric to pac or a bard to lull, it would be nice to see
more team work and making use of the stuff we have rather than people
bitching and whining that they arent getting even more than they
already are.

After all, if one more SK constantly asks for a rod while they have
VoQ and mana song going .. Im gonna ask them why they are so crap at
their job they can burn their mana quicker than the nukers..
