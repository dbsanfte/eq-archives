I just reached the maximum number of friends aloud in the game and I was
wondering if there was any way of removing them from my list.  I already
tried the ingame help command, but there seemed to be no option that would
help.  Also, all my attempts to try variations of the other ingame commands
to get rid of people on my list did not work either.  Thanks for any help
that you may have.
