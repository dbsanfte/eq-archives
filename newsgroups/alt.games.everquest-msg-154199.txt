Since the expansion hasn't been released yet, of course not.
Even at release, there's still no guarantee they won't add
other spells weeks or longer later.

Druid and shaman heals still have the same problem:  they're
not as mana efficient as a CHeal.  It'll obviously not hurt
as bad if the MT has 7000 HP as it would if they had 11000 HP,
but it's still reduced efficiency.

I doubt that.  Guilds with level 65 players are likely to have
tanks with over 7500 HPs, strictly from mudflation.

As I said before, it ignores what the designers are trying to
do.  If you have *any* CHeal, that heal and its caster's mana
pool (both actual and renewable during the fight) becomes the
limiting factor on encounters.  The developers said they don't
want that to be the case any longer.  They took steps both to
limit the effectiveness (nerfing CHeal) and to limit the total
available mana pool (nerfing mod rods.)  I don't see them
turning around and putting it back in the game, at least not
in its current form (effective instantaneous *complete* heal
from 1 HP to total HPs.)
