You go to the Nexus zone on Luclin.  The ports are free.  If you find out
how to get to Nexus from Norrath then getting back down is obvious.

To get to Nexus you must go to a zone with a full wizard spire.  The
locations are: Great Divide (deadly), North Karana, Toxx, Greater Faydark
and Dreadlands.  Walk up to the Nexus Scion and say "journey to luclin" and
it'll give you a gem.  Just put that in your inventory and have a seat.
Within 15 minutes you'll be ported up.

Once in Nexus you just have to find the mini-spire that goes to the place
you want to go.  I don't believe any gem is needed for the ride back down.
If I understand it correctly, if you want to go to Great Divide you use the
Odus portal...I don't know how you can tell (besides listening to game chat)
where it's going to port you.
