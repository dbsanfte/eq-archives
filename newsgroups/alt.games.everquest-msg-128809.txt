Totally random.

Also note that other classes can get crits via the AA Casting Fury. The
skill notes precise percentages of the chance (2, 4, 7 percent IIRC). A
wizard just increases his own chance with those percentages.

What I'm more interested in is how to get more double bolts. Those beat
crits flat down with a chance of double damage, both focussed. Best one so
far for me was a double hit of 1180 (yes that's 2360 dam) on some critter in
The Grey. Happens a lot there though.
