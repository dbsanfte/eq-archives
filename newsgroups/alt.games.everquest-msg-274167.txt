Updates:

1) My ex flatmate had an A7n8x-x with an AMD2700 with
exactly the same symptoms. Bizzare.

2) My personal desktop is an A7n8x-x with an AMD3000. 

Brought partners motherboard, ram and cpu back to my
place. Flashed my mobo to the latest release, and 
reboot.

BEEP BEEP BEEEP.

Urm. Oh dear.

Reboot again.

Powers up fine. Odd.

Put her cpu in my machine. Booted fine. Ok, CPU is still
working.

Next, pulled my ATX power cord + speaker connector out,
popped them on her motherboard, put *my* cpu and a
stick of my ram in her mobo with a spare AGP graphics
card, powered it up by closing the jumper pins with
a screwdriver.

Realise I forgot to transfer my heatsink/fan and no longer
have a powerswitch. Shit. Off at the mains.

Put my heatsink on, turn back on - hmm, sorry hon, looks
like... *click* monitor powers up.

Odd. Go into bios, change settings to conservative settings
(166mhz ram speed instead of 200, to match the CPU FSB),
generally diddle with bios settings making everything my
idea of 'happy'. Turn off.

Working motherboard, then.

Remove my CPU + RAM, put hers in. Dunk. No joy. Agh. sorry
hon.

Take her RAM out, put a stick of mine in. Zzzooop. Boot up.

Oh. So your RAM might be duff.

Try her RAM in my motherboard. Works ok.

Uhm?

Put one stick of her RAM in her board with her CPU.

Powers up.

Put her other stick in.

Powers up.

So now, I have her RAM, CPU and motherboard all working together
where previously none of them did.

Black magic.

Odd. Odd. Odd.

All I can think is the RAM timing change did it but... its
very odd. It feels almost like the mobo wanted to boot ok
'once' with my 3k CPU before working with hers - I did
nothing, in the end, at my place with her kit we hadn't
done at hers.

Maybe the PSU. But I doubt it. The PSU ran the A7V8X-X fine.

Hrmm ;)
