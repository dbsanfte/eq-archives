Can't comment on the XP, but for example, the mage chest reward for the
level 45 armour quest (which involves killing one named bear you have to
spawn) results in an FT3 45mana robe.

The bear would be a decent challenge for a group of that level but everyone
in the group would get a chest reward.  There's a lot of quest content in
TSS, and from what I hear the lower level stuff is the best quality (i.e.
there are concerns about itemisation on the high level quests).

XP in the higher level zones appears to be good, and one friend who's
levelling a pair of wizards appears to be enjoying the XP in the Moors, the
zone outside of Crescent Reach.
