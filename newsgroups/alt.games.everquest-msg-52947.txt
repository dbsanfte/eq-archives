In the group I play with, the warrior gets Aug and the Rogue get Alacrity.
These are the only 2 Meleer's in the group.  The people in this group are
very fun to play with and don't crunch numbers, so they really don't give a
flip which one they get, so that was a decision -I- made.  I figure that the
Rogue is doing damage and doesn't get hit too often, so a better haste makes
sense.  The tank ( his wife ) is taking a lot of damage so the other buffs
may help more than the extra haste. *shrug*  I don't crunch EQ numbers
either, so this may not be right.

If I am with people not from my main group, I give them the option, and most
of them don't know what Aug is, so I give them the number on each and let
them pick.

I can't help you with soloing.  I don't get enjoyment out of soloing my
Chanter, so I don't do it.
