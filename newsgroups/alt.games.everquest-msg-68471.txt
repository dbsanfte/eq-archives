Or it might be the zone.  One time we had a guild event
in Timorous Deep, and we all noticed that our buffs were
fading *way* faster than usual.  The final proof was
when I died and a Cleric tried to rez me about 50 minutes
later, and got the "That corpse is too old" message,
which should not have happened until 3 full hours had
elapsed.

I /petitioned and a GM double-checked the times, and
conceded that even after the additional time for the
/petition and GM response time, I should *still* have
been under the 3 hour limit, yet even he couldn't
cast a normal exp rez on me.

Earlier in the same guild event, a guy was /shouting that
his corpse in TD had poofed from the zone, even though it
had been only about 18 hours since he had died.

The only thing we could figure was that TD's "clock" was
running way fast on the server that night.
