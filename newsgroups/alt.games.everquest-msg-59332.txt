Typical shaman problem. You can not do all of it at once. A group
with 5 tanks and a shaman is just wrong. An enchnater hastes betetr
than yoiu, a cleric heals better. So try to get groups that incorporate
those classes as well (apart from all the other benefits you get
by having them in). As shaman, I normally only buff the melees.
Those buff stay very long, so you have time to regenerate mana. If
there's no chanter, I speed the melees just at the start of battle.
Don't waste mana and speed them in a pause, it doesn't stick too
long. And you excel at slow after a certain level. Shaman slow is
(IMHO) one of the best spells in the game. Chanters can slow, too,
but less good, so tell them to not waste mana on slow.
