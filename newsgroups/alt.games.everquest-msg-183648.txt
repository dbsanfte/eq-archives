I saw that and wonder exactly how valuable research will become as a trade
skill.  Just thinking of magicians, while there are exceptions, most of the
drop only high level spells are easily available in the bazaar and the
prices are just dropping and dropping.  The question is how much the new
research process will help with the availability of those few ultra-rare
spells like the lvl 60 pet heal (I'd hate to see the research skill required
to create that one).
