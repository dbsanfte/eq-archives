Mutahq's comments are pretty much correct. I played on Sullon here and there
for a month or two and wasn't terribly surprised at the sewer it quickly
became; one good thing, though, was that it seems to have funneled away a
large precentage of the jerkoffs that had formerly made their home on
Rallos, where I played as a number of characters for 2.5 years. Rallos was a
much better place when I left EQ about a month ago.

That being said, Dstep is also correct in asserting that PvP in EQ is
generally screwed. It's designed poorly, is hideously unbalanced, favors
pure casters, and was really nothing more than an afterthough in a game that
is meant solely for PvE.

If you're going to play PvP in EQ, I'd try one of the Team servers, Tallon
or Vallon Zek. But to be prefectly honest, if you're really interested in
good, balanced PvP that is enjoyable for all involved, check out Dark Age of
Camelot. I've been playing DAoC since Beta 4, and am having a better time
than I had in over 2 years of Everquest.
