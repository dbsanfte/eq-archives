It depends on how you assign your abilities/combat buttons initially. 1-6
represent the ability buttons and 7-10 represent the combat buttons. The
order of numbering goes: topleft: 1, topright 2, middle left: 3, etc.
So if you set Fishing on ability one and Begging on ability 2, you can do
"/doability 1" to trigger Fishing. But if you change the two, thus setting
Begging on 1, "/doability 1" will trigger Begging.

Hope this clarifies things.

ps. If you're a caster try setting a /doability to trigger sense heading
with each casting. It will go up with every level and makes sure you can
find your way when you dive into unexplored areas.
