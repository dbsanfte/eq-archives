I completely agree that the level of difficulty of each quest should
be proportionate to the reward. However, there is a big difference
between difficult and tedius.

Difficult would be defeating a mob that required just the right
strategy, timing and a bit of luck. This camping for days business is
ludicrous. It is not hard at all to camp a mob for days...that is, if
you're not the person paying for your EQ account. You see, that person
has a job and some semblance of an outside life and therefore can't
spend days on a stupid camp.

They should make the loot/quest mobs very difficult and/or
unpredictable, not impossible for such a large segment of players.

Flame off to all of you who are able to hold down a job and an alleged
social life and still complete these marathon camps. I never said you
don't exist, just that there are so few of us who really even have the
option. No sour grapes here or anything, I just think the whole idea
of these camps was a very bad one.
