This cracked me up so much.  I have a group of RL friends i play with.  65
SK, 65 Mage, 65 Shaman, 65 Cleric, 64 Bard, and me a 65 Enchanter.  There
are some other people that play with us and we aren't always on at the same
time, but the group make up is usually those characters.  Anyhow, one night
we were fighting in either Veksar Highborns/Sythrax or we might have been in
Droga.  Regardless it seemed like after every 3 pulls or so the SK would say
Haste/Kei please.  I'd laugh and say, I don't think they nerfed the duration
on it yet.  He would then reply, I guess i should FD pull around the
dispellers eh?  I know what you are saying but it just seemed funny to me
because it was the exact situation but he really did need haste over and
over.
