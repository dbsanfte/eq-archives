Yes, of course you can make it simpler.

Are you looking at an SK or a warrior?  Well, I can derive that from 
your latest message, since you say with all AA.  But prior to this 
point, that wasn't at all clear.

And its irrelevant, because my complaint wasn't with you, it was with 
your claim that the SOE post was clear as day... when I think its pretty 
reasonable to read the post as written, the other way.
