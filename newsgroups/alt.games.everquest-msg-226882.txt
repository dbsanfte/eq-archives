Your guildmates have my sympathy, but the law of averages proves your 
scenario to be the exception, not the rule. The only factor which may 
cause loot to go much more often to a person who seldom participates 
would be having a far greater number of those people in the guild to 
begin with. The problem there is not he loot awarding system, it's the 
presence of so many part-timers in the guild. Random would seem to work 
best for the majority in that case.

If the general level of dedication and participation is high, random loot 
awards should work fine as well. In that case, those who don't 
participate often will see fewer awards than those that do. It works 
there as well.

Unfortunately, and I can certainly see your point, when the number of 
people who regularly show up for most raids is far less than the number 
that do, you wind up with the most dedicated not being the most awarded.

Also, for the record, you can't be a "bad randomer" or a good one, for 
that matter.
