see the post made by "PACE17"
looks like a something he can compare to...at least to me..

um..how is my statement untrue? killing frost giants (in general) raises
faction with both Coldain and CoV. yes, different giants, give different
AMOUNTS of faction, but my point is still the same, and still correct.

how do you know this for a fact? you don't. it's not an exact science, by
all means, it is POSSIBLE.
assuming that both players are killing the same types of giants, and both
have the same faction with the Coldain, and assuming neither have taken any
faction hits with either group. yes, that's a lot of assumption, but as I
stated, it's not an exact science.

that's opinion. please don't state it as fact. thank you.
