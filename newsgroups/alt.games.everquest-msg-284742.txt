I have never played SWG, so I really can't offer any opinions on it. The 
pieces that I have read ranged from mildly biased to utter hatred. I found 
very few objective posts on the game.

Speaking in generalities only, the SW universe has such a sense of 
expectations attached to it that it is unlikely that *any* game based on 
the SW universe would ever be a stunning success. It (SW) has too much of a 
cultural/emotional attachment to people for them to ever accept any 
deviations from the movies to the game as would be required for (balanced) 
gameplay.
