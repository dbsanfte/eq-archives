   You seem like a reasonable enough sort, Zel (unlike Mr. Lurkerr or
whatever).  I kinda hope you stick around.  And I wasn't trying to be a smartass
or cut you down.  But you should be aware that in this place, a.g.e., we do
check facts.  We will google while we post, we will google and research other
people's assertions if we feel they are in error.  And we do ask for and expect
cites.

   I can see how this might be viewed as good and as bad.  Bad, because we can
come across as niggling, harsh, and overly intolerant to dubious statements. 
But also good, because if you read a fact here about some aspect of EQ, you can
be fairly certain that if it isn't correct at the start, it will almost
certainly be corrected quickly.  Of course, is many instances the "facts" aren't
really available, and it might even be questionable if anyone in SOE even knows
the answer.  Then you will get long, drawn out discussion, usually with flaming,
where people will discuss their opinions on the matter at hand.  

  This newsgroup certainly isn't for everyone.  I've seen several  interesting,
fairly intelligent people give up on us because of not having a thick enough
skin.  But once you get used to the place, and learn the standards we hold
ourselves and others to, you might find that it is well worth the effort.
