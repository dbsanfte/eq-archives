When I meet a person in the game that knows how to say ( and spell ) 
"please", they get anything I can offer them in the way of buffs ( 
including my Rune III, if they are a caster or low lever).  I'll even see 
if they are a non-twink and if so, offer them something from my bank that 
is just taking up space.

Need a bind?  If you /ooc it and can use a complete sentence and spell all 
your words out, I'll come across a whole zone to do it and won't accept any 
sort of payment ( unless they are pretty high level and insist ).  On the 
other hand, this is a normal encounter between a d00d and me:

d00d: can u buff me???
me:   ( pause a good 20 seconds ) Yes.
d00d: ( just stands there )
<20 more seconds go by>
d00d: r u gonna 2 buff me??
me:   No, I am not.
d00d: y not?!?
me:   You never asked.
d00d: buff me plz.
me:   ( wait another 20 seconds, because I know it's killing him )
d00d: rnt u gonaa buff me?? i asked.
me:   No.
d00d: I ASKED U!
me:   I never said I -would- if you asked me.  In the future, if you want 
someone to spend their time, mana, and possibly money in the form of spell 
componants on you, you should take the time to attempt to use a complete 
sentence, spell your words out and use correct punctuation.  /ignore d00d

Then, I usually try to find someone nearby who can use a few Chanter buffs 
and buff them to the gills just to infuriate the d00d some more and show 
them what happens to people who don't think it's cool to act like an idiot.

I really wish there were an "Over 30" server or something along those lines 
where you had to have proof that you were 30+ to play on it.  And a /toss 
<player name> command which would work like /report but save the last 20 
lines of text.  The server GM could look at the /tosses and after someone 
gets so many, they ban them from the server, assuming the person was acting 
like an immature brat.  It would need some way like that of getting rid of 
the people that get others to provide proof for them.

Seriously, what pisses you off the most about EQ?  With me, it's not the 
economy, the quests, the rules, etc.  It's the idiots.  What a nice place 
it would be if it were idiot free.
