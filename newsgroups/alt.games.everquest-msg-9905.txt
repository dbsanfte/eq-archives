I don't do it if I can help it, but once or twice I've stayed up
as late as I could afford to with something happening the next
morning that I had to wake up for, then just as I was making my
way to a safe spot to camp out, I got killed and respawned at my
bind point five zones away...  No time to recover the corpse without
cutting unacceptably into my sleep time.
