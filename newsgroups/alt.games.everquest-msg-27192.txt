if you have 2 good weapons, use them. if you can get a fighting baton then
use it. Really, until you can afford a fighting baton, dual wield your
hands. Fighting batons go from 500pp to 1k on ayonae ro (not sure about
other servers).

Never use a shield. Other tanks do that.

Don't go over 15 stones because ever stone after that reduces your AC by so
much.

Work on all your skills. Keep tiger and round kick up. Remember to practice
mend at all costs. Really at first, put half of your skill points into mend.
Everything else goes up pretty fast.

As for gear, you should be able to afford some cured silk. They usually go
for 1pp per AC, but if you catch some tailors at a good time, you can get
them cheaper.
