Its like a street game, the rules favor the house. Basically the
person is conning other people out of cash. 

I both petitioned it and reported the text they had about the rules.
I really don't know if verant frowns on it. All I know is that verant
themselves said a long time ago why THEY won't put gambling in EQ. I'm
therefore assuming that for the same reason they would not like
players doing it.

Usually only one person does it on the tribunal server. I can tell it
is the same guy either using different characters or accounts on
different nights.

Here was the verant reason for not doing it:

NORRATH ISN'T IN NEVADA, AUGUST 28, 2000 

"Though these are good ideas and we have given tremendous thought to
them, we elected a while back not to pursue gambling within the game.
Frankly, the biggest hurdle is a legal one. Since people are selling
in-game items and platinum for real-world cash, it would allow someone
to convert their gambling winnings to cash, and cash into a gambling
medium. That would leave it open to being argued that gambling in
EverQuest is gambling in the real world. 

Though we are leaving the option open for future products, and looking
into the legal issues involved, it's not a possibility for EverQuest
going forward.
