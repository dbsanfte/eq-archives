Not at all..  There is a time for everything...

And at 2 years old, the time would be better spent teaching OTHER
things.

Put another way...

Would you prefer that your 2 yr old have a firm understanding of AIDs

grade level??

Sounds to me like you lean towards PC simply for the sake of being PC.
