God is testing my faith and patience and allowed a single raindrop to fall
on my car's windshield as I was driving home to tell me that it would rain
in the Silicon Valley during the game(I prayed that it would pour rain),
there would be a visible rainbow, the Raiders would win by more than 3.5
points and it was mostly dependant upon my faith which just has to be as
large as a mustard seed.
