For my level 47 ranger I recently purchased a Treeweave Tunic, AC 25, STR 10  -
I think I payed 1500PP for it, not sure ...
and a Barbed Dragonscale Pauldrons, AC 9, STR 5, STA 10, AGI 9, SVP 15 for 7100
PP, (positive of this, it was all the money I had.  Tholuxe Paells server).  
I am quite pleased with them  for the money... (the bank is now broke.)
