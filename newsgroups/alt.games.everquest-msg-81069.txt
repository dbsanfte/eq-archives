Don't be such a knob gobbler! You are either someone looking to hack other
people's computers or too stupid (not to mention too cheap) to realize that
this is probably a hacker program! Winsock is an API for developing Windows
programs that can communicate with other machines via TCP/IP protocol. In
other words it sounds like it's trying to connect to the hackers computer.

Why do people insist on trying to get something free? Dang it all!
