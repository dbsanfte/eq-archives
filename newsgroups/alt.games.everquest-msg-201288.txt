Well I have been playing for 3 years and my characters are constantly
getting left behind as I level so slowly. Players I have helped out as
newbies I have seen in their 60's carrying Epics or better :�)
EQ is not a race, it's journey. You can treat levelling as your goal and it
won't take that long before you catch up to others. If you truly want to be
part of the End game of EQ the only thing that will stop you is your drive
to do so and RL commitments. You may never be able to say "I remember when
they nerfed Rubicite" or "When the planes first opened" but remembering when
the game was old doesn't actually make you better player...Just makes you
sound like an old man living in the past ;�)

EQ doesn't require manual skills so providing you are willing to learn to
play you class(es) and work with group/raid then you will do fine.
Your character may seem at a disadvantage when you see all the Twinks
running around with their shiny equipment but they started as you did once
and chances are they got their first character through the early levels when
the game was less player friendly.

Don't be afraid to ask things you don't know in game but be careful of
expecting people to do too much for you, nothing worse than giving someone a
helping hand only to have them ask for more.

If you want to know about something that is bothering you and no one in game
seems to be able to answer in a sensible way then try asking in here. There
are enough longtime players here that know more about the game than can be
considered healthy ;�) Ok sometimes they don't agree with each other but
that just adds to the fun.

EQ2 is still a long way off. Don't think Beta has even started yet. Star
Wars should be due for release shortly...I don't think I really want to see
SOE turn the game from an RPG (which they apperently intend it to be) to
another EQ catering for FoH's desire to take down the Emperor.
