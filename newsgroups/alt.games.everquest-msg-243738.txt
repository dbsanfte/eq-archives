The one character rule is one of the primary reasons I don't play on
FV. I like to RP a variety of characters. Not for twinking purposes,
but because I RP a different personality character for whatever mood
I'm in. Having to stick to one means there'd be days of awful RP
because I'm just not in the mood to play his/her personality right. I
can't, for instance, play my upbeat and optimistic character when I'm
in a dark and brooding mood...
