Personally, I'd advise skipping studded & reinforced leather, unless
you're a blacksmith or are friends with one.  YMMV.  I certainly
wouldn't recommend doing it exclusively, when spider silk is also
available.  You'll need to learn brewing for cured silk, but brewing is
necessary for shawl 7 anyway, so you'll have to learn it sooner or
later.

I did patchwork to 26, raw silk to 36, cured silk to 82, hopper hide
armour to ~95 (greyhoppers in Marus Seru are easy and drop a greyhopper
hide about 2 in 5 kills), and am currently at 114 skill working on
crystalline silk.  Quivers (HQ cat pelts) are also viable up to 115
skill.

I may give up on crystalline silk soon and just do Wu's - it's more
expensive and an enchanter is required, but gathering the silk is less
of a pain.  Wu's is also much more saleable than crystalline silk.

Indeed :(  Although acrylia drops now in the Deep as well, so you can
take a group of your level 50+ friends and actually get some xp while
gathering the stuff.  Wyverns, drakes and (if you're that heartless)
othmir in Cobalt Scar also yield some high-level tailoring components.
