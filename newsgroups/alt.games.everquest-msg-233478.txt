There is no 'best' race. Most starting stats can be made up with
gear. But I'll play along

Warrior - Ogre, no stuns from the front is huge.
Shadow knight -  Ogre
Paladin - Dwarf
Rogue - Dwarf
Shaman - Iksar, best starting Wisdom and regen.
Necro - Iksar, for necros hp and regen are mana.
Ranger - Halfling
Enchanter - High elf
