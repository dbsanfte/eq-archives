From the shadows, the mysterious newshound007@freedom.net
(newshound007) (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

No, you didn't. Here's the relevent quote again:

>>It's a fallacy
>>because it ignores other factors that may be the cause(s) of the
>>events

You have yet to demonstrate any evidence to show why "increased
subscription numbers indicates ease of travel didn't hurt anything",
your earlier assertion. Without the evidence, your premise doesn't
lead to your conclusion. Evidence against is blatantly obvious and has
already been mentioned elsewhere: the subscription numbers could have
gone up due to the bazaar, the new zones and content, more people
double accounting, etc etc.. there's a ton of them, and it's probably
a combination of everything, and this could (and plainly does) easily
outweigh the problems caused by the new ease of travel.

In the end, however, your original statement remains a fallacy. The
fact subscription numbers went up in no way proves ease of travel
doesn't hurt anything.
