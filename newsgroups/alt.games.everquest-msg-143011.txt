It's basically a Quickness potion [which tops out at 30% spell haste]
with a longer duration than the Tamed Mercury potion (cheaper
components, trivs at 70) but much MUCH harder to make and therefore
more costly.  Good luck finding any of these potions for sale in the
Bazaar, alchemy is such a plat sink all I ever see is SoW pots with a
sprinkling of IVU and port pots.
