There is a simple solution to that, which could easily be implemented in 
the current EQ, if there was the will to do so, without penalizing high-
level players. Simply, allow players to sacrifice items for xp -- the 
better the item, the more xp it earns. It would clear out items from the 
world, and it would allow powerlevelling but without taking the low-
level mobs from the low-level characters who really need them.
