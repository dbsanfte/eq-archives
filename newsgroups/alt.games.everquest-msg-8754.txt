LOL! Well, I'm man enough to admit when I'm wrong. Your Troll is about 22
levels higher than mine.   :o)   I certainly can't remember being stunned
with mine, and I'm sure I've read at LEAST one site that says Trolls can't
be stunned either. But the proof's in the pudding and if the man says he was
stunned, then he musta been stunned.

Unless you were on a PvP with a wizzy dropping his Tishan on the wrong
target, of course...  ;o)
