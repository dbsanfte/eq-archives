Thing is, yeah, we're going to disagree, but you're disagreeing with the
wrong thing.

*I* say there's plenty to do for a casual player in their 50s.  Lord knows
there's tons of underutilized level 50 dungeons where you can take one group
and get experience.  My guild tends to go to Kael, Icewell, ME, The Hole or
Seb (the only lemming zone in the bunch).  All are one group.  All are for
xp and socializing, though hoping for an item upgrade.

You can have a hell of a lot of fun getting to level 60 without raiding.
The only thing I can see stopping you is the lack of dings.  At level 51-53
you can do the xp/group/socializing thing with your friends from
36-60...it's a fantastic level in regards to flexibility.
