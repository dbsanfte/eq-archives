Shrug. On terris thule it is extremely common for raiding guild members
to have alts in other guilds. For those of us who have played for 5 years
we have friends all over the server. Primarily loyalty is to the raiding
guild, but its good to hang out with friends out of raid hours too. Nobody
bats an eyelid at it.

I think the core issue is that you are not deceiving, or neglecting your
responsibilities to, either guild.
