Stonebrunt Mountains. Good xp and I understand much better than usual loot.
Gems that probably shouldn't be dropping there ARE.

The tough part is just navigating through The Warrens to get there (another
good place if you're very careful...no kiting is possible though) but after
you've made the trip twice it should be a piece of cake.  Nothing that I've
noticed sees through invis.

The best thing is that if you want to solo you'll have lots of room without
too many people around.  The zone is inconvenient to get to so the
lemmi...errr, the players tend to avoid it.
