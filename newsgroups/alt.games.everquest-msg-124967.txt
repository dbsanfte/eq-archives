awwwww - had a near perfect streak going as the Wise and Virtuous
TwoHead(tm) - and then blow it all to hell with a line like that.  Cmon
Twofer - certainly you can understand someone not wanting to get involved in
petitioning patrols and spending hours trying to get other players in
trouble - or maybe not.

More power to the replied-to poster - wants to play his/her game and just
ignore the morons that have to take the quicker way there.  I'd imagine
he/she pays the idiots as much attention as I do the *cough* non-cheating
twirps that need to twink out level 1 characters with planar gear and epic
weapos.
