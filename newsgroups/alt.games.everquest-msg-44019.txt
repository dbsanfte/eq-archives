I somehow managed to get the CIH virus in the last couple weeks and only
discovered I had it last night.  Everquest would repeatedly repatch and tell
me to restart, I went to the sony official sight and to my dismay found out
those were the signs of the CIH virus.  I did have an anti virus at the time
but prmptly downloaded 5 of them, Norton, Mcafee,  Protector plus and
F-security.  Problem is 3 of them don't work.  When I attempt to install I
get "An unexpected error has occured with an invalid attachment. Please make
note of this error.. (error 301, 0)"  or I get can't load at the desired
address and is not relocatable. Contact your vendor to get a version that is
compatible with this version of windows".  Take into account I'm 100% sure
that I got the win 98 version of the programs.

The only one that would install is protector plus and it found the CIH virus
and cured over 300 files infected.  Problem is Run32dll.exe and several
other important exes are infected with CIH and protector plus cant seem to
cure them.

I tried CleanCIH dos utility and it seems to read through everyone of my
300+ exe files and it says nothing is infected.  I tried Nortons specific
CIH utility but in dos I get the message this program cannot be run in dos
and in windows a dos prompt window pops up and immidiatly dissapears when I
run the program.

Now I cant seem to install any other anti virus programs and Protector plus
isnt killin the stupid thing.  Anyone have any ideas?  I know CIH will come
into effect the 26th of each month and I've set my clock back so as not to
be effected, but it still messed up my comp. and is stopping me from playing
EQ.

Sorry about the length I just wanted to get all the details down.
Thank you so much for your help in advance guys.
