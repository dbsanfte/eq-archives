Annoys me too, especially if someone upgrades my sow to spirit of
eagle when I am heading towards Velk's :)

Side note on unnecessary buffing: I logged in last night with half
health and mana, went to an inn in EC to unload junk, and was suddenly
getting 'You feel a little better' messages with no report of how much
I was being healed. Stepped outside, and there was a bearded dwarven
lady, a level 9 cleric, plinking heals at me. I told her to stop, she
said 'but you're hurting!' and kept healing me. I told her to do a who
on me, she kept going. I told her I had 1400 hps at the time (of
2000ish, was buffed) and she said she'd at least added a hundred or
two, and anyway, it was alteration practice. So, I buffed her with
sow, chloro, skin like nature and shield of thorns, and told her to go
practice melee instead :)
