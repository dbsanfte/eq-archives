Melody is useful in downtime. Melody is useful if your a useless bard 
who doesn't play the class well, in a group that doesn't really need 
you. Melody is useful if you are on an easy raid, and are just there to 
sing a few buffs and regens while staying out of the way.

Twisting is still required if you are doing CC, slow, tanking, or 
otherwise getting really involved in combat. Melody doesn't cope with 
fizzles or resists or interrupts (stuns) or changing situations well.

It's definately a nice feature... but unless you were a pretty useless 
bard its merely a nice tool to allow you to take a break when nothing 
serious is going on, while still being productive. But its not a 
replacement for twisting in the thick of things.
