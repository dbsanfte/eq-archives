Well, this proves a rumor that I have often heard, but suspected to be
untrue. You DO still
lurk on this newsgroup and show an interest in your orphaned child! 8-)

Seriously, it is great to hear an "insiders" view of Everquest. Some of the
rants
and flames that flood this newsgroup that are delivered as "something told
to
me by an EQ insider" tends to get a bit boring. Just name droppers trying to
convince us that they have the inside scoop. Then out of the darkness, one
of the origional EQ dieties steps in and posts not only his opinions, but a
back-
ground behind decisions that were made by Verant after his retirement from
the
game. Sometimes these changes seem to be made on a whim, especially to those
of us that dont play the test server (I have trouble finding time to play my
2 mains
on Mith Marr server, much less a server that might drop my character at any
time)
so, to have you step in and show a background behind these changes is
refreshing.

I invite you to post more often, Brad, if for no other reason than to help
fight the
flames and trolls that lurk in this newsgroup.
