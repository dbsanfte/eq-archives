*shrug*
Maybe it's been changed _very_ recently, but less than a month ago I had
to help out on a CR for a Woushi victim who ported into another guild's
attack on Woushi. And later that same session was standing with him in
CS while the Drakes wandered by paying him no mind.

Not saying we didn't run into a freak bug, perhaps, but it happened. So
it can, and folks should be cautious about it, or don't come bitching
later when you are Woushi-Snacks (TM).
