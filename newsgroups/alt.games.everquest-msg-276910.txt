I thoought it might count as provocation and be a mitigating circumstance?
Would you be sentenced to the same length of time for randomly stabbing
someone or for stabbing someone who stole your posessions, who you reported
to the police but to be told that they didn't involve themselves in such
crimes?

The thing is, was he crazy for thinking his sword was a possession? A lot of
people here and elsewhere trade everquest characters and items for money;
they obviously feel that the items in question are theirs to do with as they
will, and don't agree with Sony's EULA that states these items are the
property of SOE. And we don't know what EULA that game had, maybe it wasn't
even mentioned.

In another argument here, a person claimed that what was being traded was
someone's time for money. That said, some gamers play for 8 hours a day for
6 years to build their character up, and if someone stole their character,
and they reported it and no action was taken, I wouldn't be surprised if
there was a violent response. Telling that person that the character was the
property of the gaming company always, and that it wasn't real, wouldn't
feel very persuasive to the victim of the theft.
