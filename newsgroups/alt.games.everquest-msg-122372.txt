But the trick is they can only hurt you if you CHOOSE to let them hurt
you.

If a person is 'hurt' by hearing or reading the word fuck, then I go
with opinion that they are way oversensitive.

I can appreciate that the original poster doesn't like obscenities.  I
can even understand the request to tone it down.  But I can also
understand people not wanting to limit their expression just because
the original poster doesn't like the way the do it.

This might come as a shock, but some people LIKE to cuss.  And hell,
sometimes it's just simply the best way to put something.

Why are the wise Mr. Carlin's Seven Dirty Words bad?  Why is dick
worse than penis?  Why is the word shit worse than the word excrement?
Why is the word fuck worse than the word fornicate?

What, pray tell, makes these words inherently bad?

No, I wouldn't want my child to talk that way, not until they learn
the nuances of communication.  Sometimes it's better to use somebody
elses prejudices against them when you're communicating.

Perhaps I've been to blue collar all my life, but I have probably used
some kind of obscenity, even if its just a mild 'damnit', in the
presents of at least one of each of these people at some point in my
life.  

Hell, I learned how to cuss from my father.  *cue scenes from the best
Christmas movie ever, A CHRISTMAS STORY*

Well, as long as you have an open mind on the subject.
