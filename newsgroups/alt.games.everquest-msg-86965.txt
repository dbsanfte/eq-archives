Sure. But what about that pesky "2+" part? Doesn't that change it at
all?

Of course it's not. Simple left to right order of operations there.
I'm no rocket scientist, but I'm not ready for a telethon in my honor
or anything.

Was never in question, due largely to the fact that I SAID SO right up
front.

Kinda thought that's what I was doing here, smarty-pants. Don't take
it so personally. Sheesh! I was merely asking a question, not mounting
an attack. Let me simplify my question (btw, the geeks over in
sci.math had an absolute field day with me - *hehehe...that's not an
equation so you shouldn't call it that...hehehe* - and the like :)

Is x * (2 + y / 5) the same as (x*2) + (x*y) / (x*5) ?
