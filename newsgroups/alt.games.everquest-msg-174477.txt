Well, let me point out that it *is* in the US's best interests to have a
stable international scene.  Therefore we go out of our way in many cases to
keep the international scene stable.  We also give out massive amounts of
foreign aid with no visible benefit to ourselves.  Yes, we still benefit by
making friends and allies, but there's nothing wrong with that.  No, we
won't bend over backwards to make everyone happy, but we can and do help
people out when it doesn't run contrary to US interests.  When something
*does* run contrary to US interests, well, as you said yourself, the
function of the US government is first and foremost the welfare of the
*American* people.  We may help out other nations when we can, but I find it
somewhat naive when various foreign governments get upset with us for *not*
helping them.  Make no mistake, we don't owe anyone anything, although you
have every right to apply diplomacy, or if you feel the need, even military
force, to try to get us to do (or not do) something you think is the correct
course of action.  So I guess when it comes right down to it I don't really
have any right to blast you for disagreeing with US foreign policy.
However, I think anyone who claims America is the Great Satan should step
back a second and (1) look at their own country before they blast us, and
(2) think about why they have this idea that we somehow owe them anything.
And you might consider that while America may not always treat other
countries "nicely", the US government *does* do just about everything it can
to protect the American people -- something that can't be said about a lot
of governments today who make it their goal first and foremost to grab power
and make themselves rich.

Saddam Hussein is a perfect example of this.  As proven by the sanctions
currently imposed on his country, he is perfectly willing to sit in his
comfy capital and let his people starve to death, while he laughs at the
world, knowing that soon we'll lose our nerve to sit and watch those people
die.  He figures that since he doesn't give a flying fuck about his people,
he can sit it out longer than we can -- because even though we care more
about Americans than anyone else, we *do* care that innocent people are
dying in his country.

No, you don't.  But I think it's a bit blind to call America the Great Satan
simply because we don't do what you want (I'm not saying that you've said
this, I'm referring to the many, many people who have said this and will
continue to do so as long as we exist as a country).

Obviously there are people on this newsgroup and elsewhere who say that
we're being blind sheep led around by our noses by Pres. Dubya, who is
fucking all of us over and putting us directly in harm's way just to make
himself rich.  Well, I guess that's your right to believe if you so wish,
but contrary to popular opinion, most educated Americans *do* know what's
going on, and we still think that Saddam Hussein needs to be taken down
using military force.  We also believe that other nations who are also
threats to our national security (such as North Korea, Saudi Arabia, etc.)
should be dealt with by non-military means until and unless such means
notably fail.  In which case we'll be left with no choice.  But SH has given
us no choice.  I'd be surprised if *anyone* would claim that diplomacy,
threats, bargaining, anything is going to work with Saddam, short of
allowing him to do whatever he wants, which we're certainly not going to do.
And yes, oil is an interest in that region, but oil (and the impending
shortage thereof) is only one small reason for our interest in Saddam.
We've spent many billions of dollars for many years keeping nuclear,
chemical, and biological weapons out of the hands of irresponsible
governments, and if I may speak frankly, it's a bit stupid to suddenly claim
that *this time* we're doing it just because we want his oil.  Yeah, sure,
we'd like to be able to buy his oil, but there are many other reasons, most
of them more pressing than oil, that it's in the interest of the American
people to go to war with Saddam.  That is my opinion.  But feel free to
disagree.

Oh, by the way.  I couldn't find the relevant posts so I'll mention this
here.  To those people who claim that Dubya is getting rich off high oil
prices (and therefore wants to start a war to jack oil prices up even
higher) -- how exactly do you figure that?  If the oil prices were high
because Dubya jacked up the prices to increase his company's profit margin
(is he still in the oil business anyway?  I thought he's bought out of
that -- could be wrong though), then I could see your point.  But the prices
are high because it now costs more to get the oil in the first place than it
used to.  As follows:

Say it costs an average of $20 to import one barrel of oil, and the oil
companies get $27 out of that barrel of oil.

So, profits:

  $27
- $20
--------
    $7

Now, some Middle Eastern countries cut off their oil supply to us.  Our
sources now cost more, and the average price of a barrel of oil is $30, and
the oil companies now sell their products at higher prices to get $37 per
barrel.  So:

  $37
- $30
---------
    $7

Duh.  How could profits rise from having to paying *more* for a barrel of
oil?  As a matter of fact, the *lower* the oil prices, the more money the
company can make simply by selling their products at prices equal to, or
slightly lower than, previous prices.  I just find it incredible that anyone
could be so eminently stupid as to claim that American oil companies are
making more money by having to pay more to get oil.  That's utterly
ridiculous.

If you're claiming that we want the war to assure a steady flow of oil in
the future, well, that makes more sense, though I still disagree that that
is the only reason, or even a major reason, for the war in Iraq.  But I jsut
couldn't believe it when someone said, if I remember correctly, "How much
money do you think Dubya and the oil companies have made off sky-high oil
prices?"
