A good idea would be to change your auto attack key from "a" to a
different keyboard character that you will probably never use in
regular conversations (such as the "=" or equal sign); otherwise you
can wind up getting killed by an NPC, such as an NPC that gives a
quest, where you start talking to him or her and hit the "a" key and
then the <return> key and wind up activating your auto attack, after
which the NPC will get mad and kill you in one hit.  

Of course, now that they added the prompt box to characters below
level 10 who target red mobs saying something like  "this mob is a
much higher level than you and you will probably die in a fight with
this mob; are you sure you want to attack it?" you can just click "no"
and you won't activate auto-attack; but it's still a good idea to
change your auto attack key so this won't happen after level 10.
