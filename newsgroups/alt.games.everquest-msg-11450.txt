If you're going to be a tank, be a warrior.

If you're going to be a warrior, choose Rallos Zek as a religion, not 
agnostic - there are good cultural items and good velious quests available 
for RZ worshippers.

If you're going to be a warrior, be an ogre.  Best stats, and immunity to 
melee stun from the front.  If you must not be an ogre, be a troll (regen 
which is only intresting pre-20) or a barb (can wear medium armor, and 
factions aren't as bad, but blind).  The 3 large races get Slam, that is 
bash without a shield even if you're dual-wielding - invaluable against 
caster mobs and runners.

Put all the starting stat points you can into stamina, and the other 5 into 
STR.

In the long run, your most important item stats will be Stamina, AC and HP, 
but up to level 20 or so you'll also want to get dex items to improve your 
weapons skills advance rate.  Try to keep 1hs, 2hs, 1hb, 2hb, piercing, 
slam and kick all up to max (you'll only really succeed in doing this in 
your late 20s with the levels going by so fast).

For the training points, put single points into the skills that need one to 
start, but otherwise save them for your disclipines.
