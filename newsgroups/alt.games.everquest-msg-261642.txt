Just a random slave spawn. Is the slave spot nearest the back tunnel to
stream.
Kill all orcs in area when Kelynn spawns if you are fighting orcs he will
assist the orcs as he is a spy.
Turn in keys to slaves from slavers to speed up spawn.
I think a new slave in Kelynn's spot is every 20 minutes but forget.
