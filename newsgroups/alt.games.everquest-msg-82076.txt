I don't see why Verant doesn't put in a disclaimer like used in
books and movies.  Just like every other clause you would have to
agree to it.  All names used are fictional and any resemblance to
persons living or dead is purely coincidental.  Works for every
movie and book written and lets people use any name that isn't
vulgar like Sukie Longtime (a character name I saw a girlie gnome
have).  For the record the name didn't offend me at all, as a matter
of fact I have never seen a name that does offend me.  I did not
/petition and never will  for any name.
