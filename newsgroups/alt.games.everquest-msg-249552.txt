If you face the door from behind the table (with the book in front of you)
and click, it gives you that message.  Rogues can skill up their lockpick
skill there, safely.  Not sure if it really goes anywhere or not.  None of
the rogues that I know who used that for skillups ever said they actually
opened it.
