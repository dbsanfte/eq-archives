    The facts, as presented on EQTraders, were that the GMs permakilled the
vendors, first the well-known one, then the lesser-known one in FG, on all
servers. If there's more to it, I hadn't heard about it. I had heard about
your server's guild deciding to play EQ.cop, though.

    Get over your petty jealousy, Jazz. If you actually tried to read my
posts, instead of assuming I'm sneering down my nose at you, you'd be able
to post with half a clue.

    I was unaware that a GM had told people it was "as intended". I was
aware that guides had told people on other servers that it wasn't considered
an exploit to do it, though.

    See the wink after my "maybe they were told to do it in guild chat"
comment - this was making fun of the close relationship that apparently
exists between your old server GM and the local uberguild, and how the
server GM even talked in /gu to them. I figured you'd get a chuckle out of
the patently absurd idea that a GM would tell players to solve a CS issue. I
had no idea this incident was such a sore point with you that such a jibe
would go RIGHT OVER YOUR FUCKING HEAD.

    Hardly. It was none of their damn business, and that's why I expressed
surprise that any guild would do such a thing. HOWEVER - when the GMs come
and see that the guild in question was doing what they, the GMs, were about
to do ANYWAYS, why the hell would they punish the guild? What would they
say - "Um, we're about to do the same thing you did, but, um, you did it
wrong, er...."

    No, I am surprised. You may be shocked, but most endgame guild players
don't give a damn about minor blips in the EQ economy. They do care what
others think about them, though, as they like attracting quality recruits
and don't like being shunned when looking for a port, res, SoW, item to
purchase, etc. Really, the fact that your server was the only server that
had this happen should have clued you in to how odd it was.

    *shrug* Guild A saw what they figured was an exploit that would have
game-breaking effects on the economy, and acted to prevent the problem from
getting larger. Considering the GMs came to the same conclusion as to how to
deal with the problem (perma-kill the vendor), you shouldn't be surprised
that the GMs didn't punish the players for overstepping their authority. Had
the GMs NOT perma-killed the vendor, I agree that a lack of
warnings/suspensions would have been odd. But like I said above, it's hard
to punish someone for doing what you yourself are about to do. I can just
imagine all the posts by your local uberguild proclaiming "BS GM hypicrisy (
sic)!!!" had they been sanctioned.

    Only if the GMs were about to come along and perma-kill the banker.

> It's VI's responsibility to fix these things. Not the players.

    I agree. But I just don't see a rational GM punishing someone for doing
something that GM ends up doing himself to prevent a problem.

    Bet he's a "holier-than-thou" type, too. They're the sort to try and
stop such "mass exploitation that will ruin the entire server!!!!!"
