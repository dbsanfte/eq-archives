They don't either.  They posted yesterday (I believe) that it was down on
live indefinitely.  They didn't say why beyond it needing more work.

Hopefully having to do with the hugely easy bind point ganking exploit.

BTW, played an MPC again yesterday on test.  For the boring newbie ones I
walked up to the newbie, whacked them once to get their attention, then let
them kill me.  Actually it was all boring yesterday...not enough players.
