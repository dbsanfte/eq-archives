<<snip idea about perma-death RPG>>

If a game was designed around this system, it could work.  Obviously it
wouldn't work in EQ as it is today, nor do I think EQ could be reasonably
adapted to something like this.

I think faster progression would be needed.  Imagine you had just hit level
60.  You did that recently, no?  Then you die.  Now realize how long it will
take you to get back there (even starting from 30 with "decent" gear)...
Well I don't know about you but the QUIT button would look very inviting to
me :-)

If it wasn't going to take nearly as long to reach higher levels again, I'd
be more inclined to stick with it.  I have taken forever just to get to
level 55, I'd hate to imagine starting it all over, even at the half-way
point.

No doubt about that.
