In one of the lists of possible upcoming changes
to EQ was this item:

    o Expect to see the first of the Focus Items 
    for spell casters and spell-casting hybrids soon. 
    We will leave the specifics to you to discover, 
    but rest assured that useful and exciting focus 
    items are making their way into the game as we 
    speak. 

I've never had a class that could get or had
to worry about Focus Items before, so I never
paid much attention to them.

But now that they're apparently going to become
available for "spell-casting hybrids", like my
Paladin, it seems I'm going to have to learn
about them.

So could someone give me the quick tutorial?
