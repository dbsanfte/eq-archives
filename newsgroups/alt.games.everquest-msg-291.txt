  Probably to prevent abuse.  So you can't have a lackey run and attack
the merchant, run to your hunting spot (orc highway, Dervish camp,
Gornit spawnpoint, or whatever) and not have to run anywhere to sell.
  Still seems like with a little bit of ingenuity and effort Verant
could fix this problem though, but having the mobs walk back to their
spawn points, or simply by having them despawn and immediately respawn
after they are attacked, or after their hate list is cleared, or
whatever.
  It is very annoying though, especially when the "bugged" merchant is
the only merchant in the area (or in the entire game) that sells a
specific item.
