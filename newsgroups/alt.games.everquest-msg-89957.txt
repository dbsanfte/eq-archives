Something that is a bit new but would work great together (outdoors though)
are Beastmaster/Druid combo.

The pet can tank with the beasty adding extra mellee when needed and the
damage sheild on the pet would work great. On difficult mob the beasty would
just throw on a dot and slow, then concentrate on healing pet whilst the
druid can keep up the pets damage sheild and DoT the mob. Once the Mob get's
low the druid can snare to stop the adds from fleeing.

Druid can also harmony pull, track even port for quick transport.

The one weakness: indoors you cop a double whammy that indoors normally have
bad pathing so the beasty has to be careful and the druid loses some casting
ability, but outdoors this group would be great : )
