Yes. It makes you undependable for raiding purposes. It doesn't make
you an undependable person.

Raid targets are chosen based on who you can rely on to be there.
Someone who plays every day for 12 hours a day can be relied on to be
there. You, having a life, can not. It's as simple as that.

High-end EverQuest is like a sporting event. If you play and practice
twelve hours a day every day, you're going to be better at it and
better rewarded than a weekend warrior. I don't know why people expect
that it would be any different.
