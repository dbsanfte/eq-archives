    On all servers but SZ, not an issue - can't bind point camp folks, can't
zone camp folks, wouldn't be too hard to add in a "can't repop-point camp
folks". It would also be vaguely stupid - they pop there naked, you can't
cause XP death on those servers... why bother?

    On SZ you'd have to leave old-style binding in, as camping the points is
legal AND can cause the person XP loss. Or one could actually make a rule on
SZ about "no camping the repop points", but "rules" and "SZ" just don't seem
to go together. ;-)
