Uh huh.  If you're serious about this, what you have just described is the
perfect recipie for getting yourself banned.  You do realize that this is a
banning offense, right?  And you do realize, that the servers keep logs of
certain types of things?  Such as the names of the characters, what account
they were created on, when they logged on, and when they were deleted?

Oh well.  What goes around comes around.
