> 1) How meaningless is death?

I think EQ2 has a very effective death penalty, achieving the right level of 
deterrence and balance without leaving players beat up and devastated by 
death. When you die several things happen:

1) You lose a spirit shard. This causes most of your main stats to diminish 
significantly and remain this way for 72 hours real time, after which the 
effect wears off. You can lose a maximum of 5 spirit shards;
2) You incur massive debt. Debt essentially slows down your leveling because 
as you obtain experience in the future, half of that experience is awarded 
to your normal experience bar, and the other half goes toward paying your 
debt. So your experience rate is effectively cut in half so long as you have 
debt. Debt also diminishes on its own over time, and if you log out for a 
couple of days it will be gone when you return. Otherwise you just have to 
slog through it, grinding out new experience until all the debt is paid off. 
Debt is cumulative, so the more deaths you incur, the higher debt you wind 
up totaling and it can become very ugly and daunting to see all that debt 
ahead of you;
3) All equipped items take a 10% durability hit, and it they ever get to 0% 
they cannot be equipped again until mended by a mender in town. Mending 
costs money, although some players will eventually have the Repair skill 
(they don't currently, you need to find an npc in town).

Your shard drops where you died, it's like your corpse but it can't be 
dragged. You need to recover your shard if you want the shard penalty to 
disappear. If you do recover it, a large portion of the debt will also 
disappear but a significant amount will remain and has to be worked off. At 
death you have the choice of Reviving, at which point you will be 
transported to a location specified in the Revive dialog (you can sometimes 
choose between several), or you can wait for someone to rez you. If you 
Revive, you'll then have to run back to your shard if you want to recover 
it. If instead you get rezzed, you'll come back where you died and will 
recover your shard automatically. The equipment hit remains. I haven't seen 
any rezzes in game that remove all debt, you will always incur debt on any 
death, rezzed or not.

Well it's a pretty controversial system, a lot of crafters who are used to 
being able to watch TV while crafting or chat at their leisure really 
despise the new system. Most of the crafters I know are enjoying it though 
because it finally elevates crafting to an equal status within the game, 
requiring just as much concentration and focus as combat. I like a system 
that keeps me engaged and rewards my attention, resourcefulness, and 
responsiveness. It also makes a lot of sense that if you're not paying 
attention while using something as dangerous as a forge, you can get hurt. 
The fact that it also diminishes casual macroing (although it won't stop the 
truly dedicated) is just another bonus.
