> Too bad that "security is largely a sham".

It certainly is a crying shame at that. The big goverment elitists in this
country have effectively crippled the primary responsibilities of our
goverment as well as having hijacked the goverment to impower themselves.

The evidence is all around. From granny , Al Gore , a seeing eye dog , and
many others being searched at airports but middle eastern men not being
because that would be profiling, to the simple fact that we spend billions
searching for recreational drug users instead of guarding our borders. You
do realize I hope that the day after we legalize drugs in this country we
put 1000`s of criminals inside this country out of work, terrorists
worldwide go bankrupt, we save billions of dollars, drug use goes down , and
the imperial federal goverment no longer has an excuse to rifle through our
persoanl lives whenever they feel like it.

Voltaire once said that all elections are an advance sell of stolen goods.
This did not use to be true here but is now. The same goverment we formed to
protect our individual rights now cheerfully loots part of the citizenry to
pay another part of the citizenry for a vote. A very old saying goes he who
robs peter to pay paul can always count on the support of paul.
