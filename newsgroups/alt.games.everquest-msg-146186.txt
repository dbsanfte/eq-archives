While it *might* be affecting sixties more (And I don't see how, since
the change should affect anyone over fifty fighting mobs at the low end
of the blue range for them) I'm certainly not seeing a measurable
change. We started out last night trying to only pull considerably
higher level mobs in Skyfire, moving to the ragefire camp. But the
downtime was excessive. We moved back to another spot where we were
pulling low blues as usual (even the occasional light blue) and my xp
gain rate was just fine for 54.
