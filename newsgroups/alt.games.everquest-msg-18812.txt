My method of late and especially since acquiring root has been Darkness,  fall

DD for the coup de grace.  The pet I use if darkness doesnt take the first 
time, but then only long enough to taunt the target off of me.  This methoud 
is good if space is at a premium and using fear causes too many joiners should 
the target wander too far away.  It can be a mana intensive method due to the 
occasional resists (asytole especially) but works fairly well for me.
