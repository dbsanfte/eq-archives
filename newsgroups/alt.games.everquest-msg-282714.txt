It's so beautiful!
Freeport actually feels like a medieval port city with great big walls,
hole in the wall (the very same graet big wall) shops and tavers, a
port that LOOKS LIKE A PORT, a lighthouse/watch tower dealie... I'm
still uncertain how my iksar's going to get about, but it really is
gorgeous. Also, Freeport is still three zones, just now it's east, west
and sewers.

The new Deserts of Ro look very much like they're from EQ2. I like very
much what they did with them. None of this "you can't walk through the
trees because" zone wall crap, the zone walls (barring the water zone
walls, which have always been there so I can ignore them) are sheer
cliff faces. Or the more sensible wall of Freeport.

At first I was thinking there wasn't much they could do to screw it up.
I mean, come on, they were three very rectangular zones with very
little obstructing terrain TO mess up. But they actually did a very
good job of breaking up some of the square-ness while retaining the
strip-o-land feel and vastly improving the look of the place. I like
the new gradual transitions from grassland to sand, and the way they
chose to break up and recombine the FOUR zones into two (East Freeport
newbie zone, North Ro and the north half of Oasis, the south half of
Oasis and South Ro).

Also, I like the new snake and cat models.

Xiphos - Once things settle down in a week or two, I think I will enjoy
exploring the place.
