Greetings all,
I have made an Enchanter Alt to level 12 so I can supply my Iksar monk
tailor with plenty of vials of viscous mana.
Now my problem is which is the best way to get him to the field of bone? I
know it is dangerous for someone of my level, but it will be a challenge I
would like to try. I think the closest place to port to is Dreadlands, or
would it be better to catch the shuttles from Butcherblock?

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Cheers
Dave.
