I had a 2nd account that hadn't been used for about 8
months...Reactivated it today and guess what? Bye Bye characters.

Sony wrote that they only held onto characters for 3 months of nonuse,
strangely- I've been playing off and on for awhile and never lost
characters.

Oh well...I'm sort of pissed considering what they charge per month,
on the other hand- they did warn.

Just sucks that when you play EQ - you are pretty much forced to pay
month to month if you want to keep your characters.
