I heard the warnings in this group and didn't listen.  I bought an
account from IGE and the orginal owner called sony and had it reset.  I
lost everything I had done with that charecter and all the expansions I
had updated it to.  SOny will not help you if you dont have the orginal
email address, age, and credit card info the account was created with.
So far, IGE says it won't help resolve.  So take a warning from and
idiot, don't get an account, for sure not from IGE, as you can lose it
a long time after you get it.  Yeah, it violates the EULA and so I got
what I was coming to me.  Save yourself the headaches and money, never
get an account from IGE or there ilk.

Dumb, Ripped OFF, Idiot
