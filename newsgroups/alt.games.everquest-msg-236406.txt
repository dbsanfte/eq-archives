One thing you're missing is that Usenet feeds sometimes fail to
receive some posts in a thread, and/or people often read a thread
for the first time after earlier parts of it have expired on their
newsfeed and are no longer available.  A similar issue is when people
have read a thread but don't go back to look at newer replies until
several days (or more than a week) later.

In all these cases, it's extremely helpful to have the prior context
*easily* readable in order to bring readers up to speed on the discussion 
(or jog their memory if they're returning to it later).

Having to flip all the way down more than a page to glance at the
context for a reply is extremely jarring.  If it's immediately above
the current reply, it can be taken in at a glance before reading
the reply, if need be.

Even worse, Usenet posters really need to follow a uniform posting
standard (either top-posting *or* bottom-posting).  Insisting on
every poster following his own preference results in "hashed"
posts such as the following, which are almost impossible to follow
with any clarity at all:

6.  Reply to #5
5.  >Reply to #4
3.  >>>Reply to #2
1.  >>>>>Original post.
2.  >>>>Reply to original post.
4.  >>Reply to #3

For this reason alone, I implore you to follow the long-standing
convention of bottom-posting like everyone else.

Also, bottom-posting lends itself readily to interspersing one's
responses within a multi-subject post, as I am doing here with yours.
The result reads like a straightforward, familiar "question and
answer" (or point-counterpoint) exchange which we are all used
to reading in print:

Q1.  First question.
A1.  First answer.
Q2.  Second answer.
A2.  Second answer.
D1.  Declaration #1.
R1.  Rebuttal to declaration #1.
etc.

Top-posting puts all the answers/responses at the top in a lump,
then the reader has to chase down the relevant questions in a block
down below.  Yuck.

If you have to do that, then someone has committed the #2 sin
of Usenet posting -- quoting too much of a previous post.  Quotes
of prior post(s) should be trimmed down to the minimum required
to make the context of the reply apparent.  There's very, very
seldom any need to actually quote "three pages of text" when
replying -- or when there is, the response is usually interspersed
in the quoted text in order to respond to small sections of it
at a time.

I'm not.

If we all posted differently Usenet would be irritating and
hard to read.  There are times when uniformity is beneficial,
not detrimental.

When writing for public consumption, one should do things
the way that they best work for the target audience

What works for us is when everyone bottom-posts.  Put up with it.


>IMHO doing something one way simply because that's the way everybody 
>else does it is not a valid reason.

That's not the reason we're pointing out to you the pre-existing
posting conventions.


>  I'm not a sheep.

Nor should you be a rebel just for the sake of stubbornness.

You certainly are.  Just be aware that the common opinion will be
that you're being selfish and annoying.

I and the other "folks" have indeed given "good, intelligent, well
thought-out comments" on this topic.  If you want to childishly
highlight one snide comment and try to pretend that's the best 
we've done, then perhaps my assessment was even more correct
than I had previously presumed.

In any case, my point is that if you're going to insist on
being a "rebel" and do things in a way that you now know
is irritating to the community just because you don't
want to be a "sheep", then people are inevitably going to
draw certain conclusions about you.  Your choice.
