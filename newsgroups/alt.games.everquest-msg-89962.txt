Whenever you seek an answer to a trade skill quest, eqtraders is THE site to
go to.

Here's a link :  http://www.eqtraders.com/location/alchemy.htm

It lists all achemy vendors, with location (on most), and inventory.

I believe the vendor in Shadowhaven you seek is:

Callowolf MacFuller
Medicine Bag, Lucerne, Sage Leaf, **Birthwart**, **Fenugreek**, Maidenhair
Fern, Mandrake Root, Allspice, Benzoin, Night Shade, Mullein, **Wolf
Blood**, Blue Vervain Bulb, Valerian Root, Yarrow, Figwort, Agrimony,
Celandine Herb
