As far as I know slaughter mobs arent any tougher than other ones.

One 58 in a group of 65's can bring down the level, Im sure it would do the
same for you. There a big difference bettween a dungeon thats for an all 65
group and the level below that enough to make it very difficult if your grou
p is mostly of the lower level.

When I played in LDoN dungeons that were average lower because of the two
58's in my group I could root and the mob in camp would die before root
broke on the next mob. Thats GI the one minute duration one. After they hit
60 the average level went up I would use the same root and root on the next
mob/mobs would break every single time before the first mob in camp died.
That was a huge thing for me because then I would have to re-root the mobs
or use the longer/slower cast root and in the end use more mana and end up
getting hurt more because after root broke the mobs always went after me. As
well the mobs would hit for a lot more and I couldnt leave the tanks alone
in the room to pacify pull (we used no slower) safely. So mobs got pulled
slower, and the rest of my group was bitching that I was pulling so slow so
we abandoned the pacify pull. I couldnt keep the MT alive and root park 4+
mobs at a time when he pulled so our experiance with doing LDoN without a
slower failed miserably.

So anyways there is a big difference bettween one level and the next. And it
doesnt look like it was helping that you really had no DPS class. If that
group was all level 56 or around there im sure you could have done it fine.
