Eh, if it inspires you I'll go ahead & say that the only critter that
requires serious tank help is Faydedar.  Thirty people including, oh, six or
so level 58+ tanks (rangers don't count :p) and various & sundry healers and
lower level tanks (you can put rangers in this part :) ) should be able to
take him down.  If at all possible, 15+ tanks of various levels.

None of the corrupteds should take more than 2 groups.  And we did Ulump
with 4 monks (though 3 had to be rezzed during the fight) tanking (levels
46, 50, 51, 59), one cleric (59, no click stick) & one druid healing, and my
enchanter spending all 10 of my peridots on Runes while we had just the one
monk alive.  It was a close call.  Had we had another cleric I know we would
have been just fine (especially me, I can't afford to throw away 10 'dots
:-p ).  Just one more druid instead of that cleric and it would have saved
me a few peridots. :)
