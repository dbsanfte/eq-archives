If you are wanting a class that can solo, you are already playing one (druid).
Once you get a few more levels under your belt and thereby get some of your
better spells, you will begin to realize the power available to druids that many
classes lack.  But that is not to say creating another character isn't a lot of
fun ).

My main is a druid, but I have a low level magician (lvl 20) and necro (lvl 16)
among other alts.  While I can by no means offer the wisdom of people who play
these classes to their zenith, as someone coming from a druid to a pet class I
like the necro.  He seems to have a little of everything in the spell department
whereas the mage spells seem to be more of a continuous upgrade to the last
level of spells.  With lifetaps and dark pact series of spells, the downtime can
be greatly reduced.  In addition, feign death, snares, root, fear and harmshield
give the necro some potent means of surviving when an encounter goes bad.

Of course there's nothing to say you can't try em both.  It's what I did.
