Because in UO, you couldn't.  Quick summary of the UO system:  there
are no 'classes', per-se.  Instead, there are a number of skills, both
combat and non-combat, each of which can go from 0-100 (skill points.)
Each character could have up to 700 skill points, divided among the
skills any way you wanted (7 skills at 100, or 6 skills at 100 and 2
at 50, or 6 at 100, 1 at 80 and 1 at 20, or any combination so that it
all added up to 700.)  Because of this, investing in non-combat skills
meant that you had fewer points to invest in combat skills, therefore
making a weaker overall character.
