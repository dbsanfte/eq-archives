	Well, I melee my cleric all the time.  With yaulp, the pet, and
the summoned hammer the targets go down noticeably faster with my help and
I don't lose much mana regeneration versus just sitting.  If I get low I
go sit down, or if things get hectic (overpulls etc.) and there's a chance
I might miss a heal I  back up, but otherwise I think it'd be a shame to give
up 5-700 per battle in melee damage.  I also nuke and stun as long as
I have sufficient mana for healing, especially on those nasty cleric mobs :-)

	In fact, I volunteer for crowd control if we dont have a 
mezzer:  pull the add with a nuke then root park it.  I use a right-click 
root so no mana issues.  It gives me something to do besides sitstandheal
and I can take the hits better than the druids...
