do i need scars / luclin expansion etc. to actually travel to those areas?
i have the basic and ruins of kurnark.

if you buy luclin expansion, does that contain everything need to play the
game?  so for example, i buy that and give my old copy to my bro so all he
would need to do is create an account (i uninstall the original, give it to
my bro, and install luclin on my comptuer)?

one last thing:  is there any way to quickly locate your body for a level 6
wizard who keeps dying (hehe)?

thanks for the help!
