I have/had a similar but slightly different problem. Geforce 2 Ti (to
replace a KyroII) would not work with EQ (ran Q3 ok) basically if I used a
dial up it would disconnect at log in (could find no IRQ conficts) and if I
used it on a shared connection it would get as far as loading the character
to world but crash as soon as it finished (message was Ddhelp Error I think)
the character did load up but would immediately go LD (obviously, as the
game had crashed to desktop)
Latest Detonator drivers wouldn't load (giving an error as it didn't
recognise the card as a Geforce card) this was even on a fresh install of
Win98se. In the end I installed Win2k and it runs fine from there. I have
had no such problems with my GF3 in my other machine <shrug>
