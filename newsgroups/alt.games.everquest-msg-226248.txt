I have 2 accounts (1 pc) and liked having my trader up whilst adventuring;
when i was medding or something I'd swap back and check how things were
going, craft, and so on. However, recently my pc (or just EQ) has been
crashing if I use Eqwindows.

 The developer seems to have lost interest in updating the program and I was
wondering if anyone knew of another program that could do the same thing?
