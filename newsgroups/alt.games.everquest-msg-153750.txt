    You should look at them again. ;-) The real gravy train has started from
Vex Thal now, with people getting one top-end loot per week. I think Kinma
would be the top monk in terms of HP gear - she posts on Monkly Business,
check her out. The biggest issue we've had with monks and gear, and it
extends to all classes, is that most of the regulars from Velious-era are no
longer regulars. So people who were geared up in NToV stuff, and would have
filled holes with Luclin stuff and had exceptional gear sets, have
retired/scaled back playing time and we're left gearing up recruits from
scratch in Luclin. Two of our ex-monks, Khanos and Asky, would have been the
sort of server-wide "top monk" you're looking at had they kept playing.

    But we do OK. Heck, I'm now over 3 K unbuffed as a cleric and I still
have the 150 odd HPs from ND3 to obtain! And I joined the guild after Luclin
release.

    James
