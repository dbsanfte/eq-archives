Dammit, I paid good money for that car... why do I need to pay for the gas?

I paid fifty bucks for that Mickey Mouse telephone... why do I have to pay a
monthly fee to call my friends?

That lamp I bought was expensive... why should I have to pay for electricity
to run it?

I bought a book last month and I don't need to pay a monthly fee to read
*it*!

No fair!
