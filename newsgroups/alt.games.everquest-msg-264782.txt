Ahh the good ol' days of Being happy if your BBS updated it's FIDO based 
newsgroups once a day, and playing Gwar and Solar Realms Elite.
Do you happen to remember a Fido group named Pillow Talk? I actually started 
that group as a test on a local BBS but it received so much fanfaire that It 
went to Fido where I moderated it for a couple years, but then AOL came 
along and Fido started to fade rapidly. Oh give me a RBBS board with an 
active telnet portal over any of the major internet providers anyday LoL.
