Totally understand that statement.  Minor equipment compared to that shield,
but had a situation that made me feel much the same.

I had been saving up for awhile to buy a Sebilite Scale Coat to replace my
Neth Chitin.  Normal going price in the bazaar was between 2k and 2.5k so
had been working on getting that money (mostly hunting the geo's in CC for
the gems).  Went to bed one night with around 1k but left my character
logged into the bazaar selling.  When I woke up some people had bought some
stuff giving me around 1650pp.  Did a search on the Seb Coat just to see
where the price was and one guy had one for sale for 1750pp.  Awesome price
but I was 100pp away and had about 10-15 minutes before I had to get a
shower and get ready for work.  So on the rare chance it would work I went
into the Nexus and did an /ooc "I know this is an odd request, and I figure
I'll get no response but laughter, but have to try.  Been trying to save up
to buy a Seb Coat and there is one in the bazaar for 250pp less than normal
but I am 100pp short.  Could anyone possibly loan me 100pp and I will pay
you back 150pp as soon as I have it?"

Moments later I get a tell from a 60 Ogre Warrior telling me to come to the
center and he gives me the money.  I thank him profusely and then go buy the
coat and come back and model it for him (part of the reason I wanted the
coat is I wanted a sexier look for my cleric than the Neth
Chitin.....shallow, but hey...)  I told him I'd pay him back as soon as I
could and he told me to not worry about it.  So I logged out and went to
work with the biggest smile on my face.

Remember thinking how odd it was though that an item in a game could feel so
much akin to buying a new car in real life.

Thanks for your story, always enjoy reading your posts Richard.
