How in the FUCK does anything see anything other than a reasonable
reaction in the following *rant*?  

"I have never once, been hostile, cursed, implied sexual content or
directly
insulted someone in this game EVER!! I don't have a character name
that is
racist, or hostile in anyway. I CANNOT FATHOM WHY MY ACCOUNT IS NOW
BANNED!!! I never received a warning, no letter, no verbal in the
game,
NOTHING. This Gestapo like treatment of me is completely unfounded!!!
I cant
believe this. TOP IT ALL OF being Sunday I will not hear from anyone
till
tomorrow if at all!! Why would this happen"

He explains that he's not done anything to deserve a banning, explains
that he can't understand why he was banned, and is rightfully pissed
off.  Generally, you want to set the scene.  If he'd just said "Why am
I banned?" he would have been flamed for not providing information.
Now either he's lying (pretty unlikely) or he was victim of an error
on Verant's part.  He's not the first one, and he's not even the first
one to post here about it (including the resolution).  I think that
maybe several people here (and I'm not picking on you Dan) need to
step away from the keyboard.  When someone gets a parking ticket from
a city they've never visited and ask how the fuck did that happen, do
you ask if they've been out shooting cops?  
I know this newsgroup has it's share of kooks, assholes, and just
general idiots, but for Bristlebane's sake, let someone who is
justifiably pissed off vent without attacking them.  Of course the
honorable thing to do would be to apologize, but I'm sure that most
who attacked could never conceive of making an error, so it won't be
forthcoming.
