Hmm.  Yeah I'd upgrade.  I was using a 500MHz with Voodoo4500 and 384 MB ram
and DSL.  Still lagged.  Upgraded to 2GHz and 3GB DDR SDRAM with a GeForce
4.  Hmm no problems now =).

If money is a concern upgrade your processor and don't skimp on the RAM with
these cheap prices nowadays.
But, be careful.  Upgrading from 450 to some large number such as 1GHz will
require you to buy a new motherboard.
