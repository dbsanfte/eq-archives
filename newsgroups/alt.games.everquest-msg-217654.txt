1800 ac 10k hps 450AA.  2 14 19 enraging blow weapons with aug 4 slots
filled with the aggro buff. Could be bottom of the barrel I guess but I bet

You are indeed correct that monks suck for pulling . They make decent dps
and that is all. For pulling hard adventures or raids I suggest a ranger
magician team coh pulling or a sk snare feign pulling.
