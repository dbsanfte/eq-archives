Hmm, 20pp or so to trivial maybe, if you're powerskilling - all the
ingredients are available on vendors, you just make fish fillets until
trivial (1 fresh fish + 1 jug of sauces) and then fish rolls until
trivial (1 fresh fish + 1 batwing). That'll get you to 135. There are a
few recipes (fruit pies etc) that will get you to 142, then you have to
find lots of brownie parts and *then* it becomes expensive if you choose
to buy those from other players. Oh, you could make Dragon steaks too, I
guess - good luck finding *that* meat...   :)
