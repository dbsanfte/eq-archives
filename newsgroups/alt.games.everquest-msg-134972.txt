I really like the new UI a lot, though admittedly it will take some
getting used to. The only real issue I have with it so far is that
when opening the inventory window or browsing a merchant's wares,
windows will open on top of other windows, thereby obscuring the
contents of both. It is a bit annoying to have to move them around to
see either very well.

The bazaar and trader mode are terrific! Once I discovered the /trader
command, the rest was pretty intuitive. No instruction required. Also,
the /bazaar command for searching is a godsend.

It does make for one laggy zone though. However, it is not as bad as I
had feared it may be, ertainly not too much worse than NFP was on it's
busiest days.

I would give this patch an A-. It is a substantial improvement. :)
