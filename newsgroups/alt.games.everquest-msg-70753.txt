I am not defending Verant....

If anyone finds that a tough decision they should seek help.
Any man/woman that would screw X-mas for their kids/family to satisfy
their "need" for EQ, should have thier head examined. 

It's just a game.

Verant screwed the pooch big time on this, but they are not
responsible for people who are so misguided as place a game (EQ)
before real life responsibilities.
