Indeed.

Also, it only works on your nukes, so if the warrior's SoD procs, that'll
probably break root anyways.  Viscid roots is the PoP "upgrade" that makes
roots less likely to break for any reason.  Viscid Roots requires this as a
prereq anyways though.  Both still not worth getting until 150+ aa.

Pretty much, unless for some odd reason you hunt in Fear a lot (exodus
doesn't work there)

SCF makes wizard wannabes happy.  QD is kinda pointless though.

Uhh, what prereq?  and what "spell mastery"?  Spell Casting Mastery?  Spell
Casting Reinforcement Mastery?

SCM is the best archetype ability bar none; SCRM is useful if you want to
fully pump up your SotW.

I got Innate Camo, Exodus, Dire Charm and MGB for Elder title.  And MGB will
eventually be useful for more than wolf forming the bazaar once I get SotW.
But I tooka 9 day hiatus, and still working on 63 so I can scribe Pot9 and
then go nuts trying to get a non-shitty price on CoT. (lowest I've seen is
35k) and I want Nature's Infusion too.
