I have had this problem as well running a slower machine.
I run a HP Pavillion PIII 700mghz with 256m and a GeForce IV 420.
I used to spend 3 hours or more at time having to reboot to get into the
game.

I have found that I have a heck of lot less freezes when I start in a
windowed mode.
I believe that the eqini file has an entry for this, set it to true; or you
can also once your in the game go
to window mode with ALT-ENTER and log out of the game.
