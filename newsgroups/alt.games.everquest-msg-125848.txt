Id like to get my hands on a list of gems in game...
All gems... vendor fodder and quest gems alike
all in one list so I can loot up and say...oh this is a quest gem.. or
oh need to sell that one...
er.. and maybe even a price for the said gem.....

any info you have would be greatly appreciated..
even if its just bits and pieces to various resources for specific
quests etc..

Thanks and Ill share my results with the group
