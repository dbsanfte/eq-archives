Sure they do why else does SoE change the ZEM? That and loot and of
course being able to find a group sell expansions like crazy. Look
theres nothing wrong with wanting to get to primo raiding level (65 +
AAs) as fast as possible. This is even more true the third time you do
it. I just wish SoE would be honest about it and publish the ZEM since
showeq has been taken out.
