Let's not forget that those poor defenseless Crushbone Orcs at one point
raized Kelethin.  I don't see any problem with avenging the Fier'Dal.  Nor
should a human paladin feel any guilt in going to Nek forrest and laying
waste to the forces of Innoruk.  After all, a small look at Kithicor shows
what Lanys and the Tier'Dal are responsible for.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
