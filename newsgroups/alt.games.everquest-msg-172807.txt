Forgive me..  outlook express (5.5)

I stopped using agent when i became a big ng downloader.. and agent did
something really crappy with multi-post files (I forget what...I think it
was the numbering, like you had to manually count each post to check no
files were missing, sucked when downloading 10 files, each split into 5-10
files)... long time ago, fading memory!  OE handled it really nicely tho...
ease of use > security and protection!!
