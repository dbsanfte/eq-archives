Level restrictions for the original planes were added shortly
after I started playing (so probably July or August of '99), I
recall the patch message referring to Cazic-Thule and Innoruuk
not wanting to be bothered by low levels (or someting like that),
so it must have predated release of what is now called Plane of
Sky.  The original epic, the Paladin's Fiery Avenger, was put in
later than that (tho I cannot recall if it was before or after
RoK was released).  IIRC, they hadn't even fixed the Soulfire
quest yet when level restrictions were added for the planes.

IIRC, the Fiery Defender (current Paladin epic, upgrade to Fiery
Avenger) and epics for all other classes were added after RoK
and prior to SoV.  At any rate this was long after they added
level restrictions for the planes.
