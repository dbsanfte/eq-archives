Depends on the start distance.  Step one, root pet.  Step two, kill
mage.  If the pet gets on him, just as if a melee reaches melee
range, he is indeed very likely dead.  Air pets especially are
extremely effective against someone relying on casting to do the job.

A clever plan on the part of the mage would be to kill that rooted
pet and cast another... but roots are a lot cheaper than summons.

Clerics also have a good stun line, in fact adequate to completely
shut down a caster while doing appreciable damage, if they are
high enough level to have at least three stuns you might never
get a spell off at all.  I know there are mobs out there I've killed
by stun stun stun nuke stun stun stun nuke, and if they ever get
a spell off they are lucky.  Of course if you happen to have a
high Magic Resist you can make toast out of this plan, since
-all- cleric spells work on MR, and they have no Tash/Malaise
type line to help break thru your defenses.  This means that
if you have a wide selection of gear, you could specifically
gird yourself against that one type of spell and have a ball.
