OK,

basically, what happens is that this file doesn't exist on the client end,
only on the server.  The EQ servers are basically just whopping great
databases, typical client-server model.   When you press 'i' to get to your
inventory, your client sends a request to the server asking for a list of
all the items you have, and back they come.    You can verify this if you
ever get obscenely high ping times, as i did a while back (abotu 3 seconds),
press 'i', because the request has to go to VI and back, it'll take bleedin
ages to open.

Very little is stored at the client end, basically its just a system for
displaying the contents of the DB in a nice way, which makes it into a game.
Even randoms are no longer done client side, once upon a time they were i
believe, but this was then hackable, and folks who knew how, could win any
random they chose.

Every now and again, somone has found a "dupe-bug" in VIs software,
basically, doing things in a certain order could confuse the DB and you end
up with the same item someone else has, but, VI find out about these, and
fix em, I would imagine 3 years on, there are very few if any serious bugs
like this to be found.

Regards

Gavin.
