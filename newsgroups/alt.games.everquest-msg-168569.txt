I think you'll find that most of the environmentalists supporting the 
chicken little theories are not "bought and paid for" in any sense.  They 
tend to be activists that heard someone else say it was so, and never 
bothered to check into it or think very deeply about it.  But they -feel- 
it is so deeply enough to go waving signs around.  Even though nobody paid 
them to.
