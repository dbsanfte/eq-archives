I tend to announce at 30% and ask for a couple of rounds of single pulls 
only. Between root-parking ads, and various heals [and a quick rebuff of 
a resist or something...] on the average LDoN adventure above 30% double 
or triple pulls with or without the wandering adds [or someone 
accidently setting off a victim] i am fine above 30%...with a preference 
to hover 50-60%. If I hit 10%, i get twitchy and ask for a 1 or 2 minute 
med break [and typically i have kei, potg, kittykrak and ft1/solstice 
earring topped with mana regen2]

I will occasionally when we are pressed for time get asked if I have 
enough to pull the entire room [5 or 6 mobs] and the amount of mana i am 
comfortable with a group pull like that depends on the rest of the 
people in my group.
