There's dictionary definitions, and there's business reality.  If I tried to
tell my boss that, by giving everyone an hour's notice that the production
server is coming down, the downtime was scheduled, I would expect to get an
earful.

And you're getting a little worked up about a minor issue, DarkT.  =)  No
need to make enemies over someone's innocent question about downtime.  I
would certainly hope this newsgroup would be a place where someone would
feel comfortable about asking questions like these.  And where people can
make mild complaints about minor things.  I'm not ranting about the
definition of scheduled and I'm not even really annoyed by the discussion -
but you're letting yourself get riled up over a buncha nothing.

Relax and go quad-kite some wyverns to get it out of your system.  =)
