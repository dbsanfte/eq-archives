Two of my Guild-buddies were killing Eyes there and they killed Yymp and got
that ribcage.  Seemed like a random spawn.

Between the 3 of us, we have spent a -lot- of time there ( we're all working
on Jewelcraft, and they are a good source of Jade, Amber, Pearl, and Topaz )
and we haven't seen the King, yet.  I want a screenshot of that guy.

I assumed he was either on the same spawn table as the guy who spawns in the
middle, or on the same table as the wandering eye / gas spore.

Does anyone know anything about the King?  Is he always on the "throne" when
he is found or is he a "Wanderer"?
