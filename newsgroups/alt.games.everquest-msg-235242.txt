   Well, sure, once you are grouped with a certifiable idiot it is usually
pretty easy to tell that sad fact.  The real trick, however, it to have a way of
knowing before you are trapped in an adventure with them.

    I do appreciate your reasons for not wanting to spill names.  I have a
similar one, but for different reasons.  If I have an negative encounter with
someone, I go to the FV soapbox (FV has a kicking soapbox, btw.  Lots of
hard-core role-players mixed with the no-drop drood junkies.  Good times.) and
post the details of the disagreement in as accurate and neutral way as I can,
leaving out the name of the other person.  This way, I can get some feedback as
to if I was in the wrong or not, and some ideas on how to avoid the problem in
the future.  I leave the other's name out of it because of the bounce-back
effect.  If one wrongly flames someone, or even deserved so, often times the OP
also gets a bad reputation for being an idiot or a whiner or whatever.

   In cases where one is dealing with an old fashioned idiot I just avoid the
soapbox altogether.  I find that their reputation takes care of itself just
fine.  Of course, this is easier to assume on FV, where each account can just
have one character.
