My second char was a Gnome Necro.  After level 6, I took him to GFay to
explore and ended up on Orc hill ( with the rest of the ya-hoos ).  I killed
tons, tons, and tons more of the Orcs.  I even farmed the belts when they
started going green on me because I desperately needed cash.

I had no trouble with the guards in Kelethin, and couldn't do any
transacting there - or so I thought.  I didn't pay much attention to
factions at that time, but it turns out that those 1000+ orcs I killed were
making me friendly with the emerald warriors, which gives you a place to
sell in Kelethin.

And, the best part about it is when I went to Spec ( Garg, Undead, etc.. )
Island in the OOT at 16th or 17th level for EXP and decent loot from the
eyes, I would stop off for a second on Sister island and kill a few sisters.
Not only was I not KOS there, I was considered their "Ally" - because I had
killed so many CB Orcs.  I would take the halberds from the sisters and give
them to my pets while killing Gargs.  I was also selling the purity belts to
the head sister chick, because I was her "Ally", even though I just
slaughtered 6 of her little hos.  While selling the belts to her, do the
Pally Deepwater Harpoon quest:

Hail the lady in the building by herself ( the one I sold stuff to ) to the
right of the shopkeeper.  Say "Where is Xyrin?" ( I think ).  Xyrin now pops
up on Garg island - right where you are going - how nice.  Go over there,
talk to her, and then she will eventually rush the specs on the top of the
island.  They don't attack her, though.  She just stands there.  She
eventually de-pops, and drops the Deepwater Harpoon.  Invis to Undead, and
go grab it ( avoiding Gargs on the way up ).  Sell it to somone in
Butcherblock or somewhere else.

It's a pretty nice weapon for a beginning Pally.  You can sometimes get
decent cash for it, and sometimes get next to nothing for it.  It just
depends on if the person you are selling it to knows how -easy- the quest
is.  I gave several away to pallys who seemed like nice people.  Your call.
