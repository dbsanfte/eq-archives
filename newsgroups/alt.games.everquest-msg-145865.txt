Oh Bull.  When melee balancing was done the Warrior was the standard
against which <melee> damage was measured.  Sure, in a raid-type
encounter the MT's job is to stand there and take it, but in a single
group fight (i.e. most of the time for most of the players) a Knight's
gimped damage output is significant, a Warrior's even more so.  It's
pretty f***ing lame that the ultimate healing class matches up with
a well equipped member of the fundamental melee class in damage output
while the f***ing Cleric is f***ing tanking ferpetesake.  What was
described by the OP is a Cleric matching a Paladin's tanking ability,
with 10x the healing ability of the Paladin, 5x the mana regen of the
Paladin, and 1.5x the damage output of the Paladin.

What a stinking crock.  Time to twink a_necro_73001274, no f***ing
point to playing a f***ing melee any f***ing more.
