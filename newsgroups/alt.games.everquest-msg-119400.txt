Great...so now we can use DEATH as a way to GAIN experience.
I'd bet the programmers would have a fit to hear about, or even better, to
witness this....who knows, if a GM caught you doing this, and they didn't
like it, as I said in another post, after the next patch day the mobs might
start re-gaining HP back at an insanely fast rate if their attacker dies.
But if they do this, then group based death kiting might work.  One person
fights to the death, just before death the other joins in.  When the first
dies, they re-spawn & return to join in just before the 2nd one dies.
Repeat the process as necessary, getting your group EXP bonus as well.
    Though I don't see them making a big deal considering that mob better
start giving a whole lot of EXP per kill at LV11 (or really 10).  I don't
think they make the LV<10 death related exploits as that big of a deal (such
as my death teleport or death mana/HP regen tactics I and many others use).
Even if you're close to your bind point, /duel someone to do this after
LV10.  I'm sure at LV30+ you'd much rather make a 1-2 minute corpse recovery
than med/heal up again.
