Doesn't take Bard speed, just a small enough agro radius that you can
move through it between mob "looks".  This is not all that unusual in
lo- and mid-level dungeons.  It can also be noted with some of the
agro mobs in OT, you can sometimes blow by a Kunark Rhino without
even a SoW on.

There is a difference, but I've never figured out if it's a change to
the agro radius, or a "fixed" delay of an extra "look", or just a
random thing where they flip a coin to see if they wanna gut you this
time.
