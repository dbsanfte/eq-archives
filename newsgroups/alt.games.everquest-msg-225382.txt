I don't see anything wrong with it, either, it's a choice that consumers
have and no one is forcing them to make it. They can voluntarily choose to
participate, or not. I don't see a moral issue here, although I understand
complaints that it's "tacky" or somehow otherwise offensive and it might be,
but I don't see that as a moral issue. Style and good taste, maybe, but
immoral?

What I *do* find annoying, however, is getting spammed at every log in with
those obnoxious ads. Since when did SOE start doing this? Yuck.
