Personally, I'm running with a Pentium 1 and 64 megs of Ram...  very slowly.
Zone times are an average of 2 minutes and as a general rule I have to avoid
Freeport like the plague, I'm down to about 2 frames per second.  Relatively
empty zones such as either of the Ros or the Karanas aren't too bad.  I do
have Kunark installed, but the framerate just pisses me off.  :)  So- short
answer:  yes.  But don't, if there's any way around it.
