Um, what?

RGC is a spell, do you mean Radiant Cure?  Not MGBable anyway.

Anyway, for a druid, MGB is damned handy on raids for MGBing Spirit of the 
Wood, which is an heal over time, it's also handy for doing the buffing, 
although, often that is still done by group to save the MGB for SotW during 
the raid.
