Mine took about a year, but being a guild leader often means putting off my
wants for others...it also means I have a LOT less time to do what *I* want.
If you work hard at it and have a level 50+ guild that raids a lot (or if
you regularly hunt with raid guilds), you should be able to get it in 6
months.

> Shissar - Weekish spawn in Fear and hardest to get to
I think 3-5 days but easily the hardest part.  First you have to be able to
clear Fear (or enough to get to her), and secondly you have to pray she's
up.

> around the clock

One 50+ group is overkill.  Also around a 3-5 day spawn.  Make a DE mule &
watch for her.

> Vessel Drozlin - kinda same as Verina Toomb
TWO 50+ groups is overkill, though one should suffice if you have a 58+
warrior.  Not too hard, but a long fight...have a good tank and a cleric or
two...other melee will make the fight that much shorter.

> Prince in Chardok - Hard to get to... got mine while running on a King
Raid
Not too difficult, but for a social guild be ready to die the first time.
It gets easier though. :)  If you have 3 GOOD enchanters it's a cake-walk
with three level 50+ groups.  With the change in the cleric epic I think
you'll be seeing lots more Royals raids...see if you can tag along on one
and ask them if they'll swing by Prince for you.  If they're doing it for
someone else, still go...it's good experience.

> Cazel - Not to hard... play a low level alt with low level friends in

Not hard at all.  One 55+ group is overkill.  Easiest way is to keep him
feared.  I believe he might have serious regen ability, so have a necro or
shaman disease him.

> Tangrin in FoB - Normally up but takes a decent force to take down

Yup, a couple of 55+ groups preferably, including that 58+ warrior.

> Ghost in The Hole - Can be easy to get to... or hard to get to... depends
on

The shaman epic guy is about 50' from him.  The paladin epic guy is at the
entrance to this building, and the ranger epic guy is down the tunnel a
piece.
Point being, take a few guys including the mentioned classes and you
shouldn't have much of a problem finding help.

My very last part was going back to Polzin in Hole.  My guild was lining up
a raid for later that day or the following weekend, but I was hanging out in
Hole to see if I could catch a ride with a guild.  I lucked out...within 30
minutes one of our best raid guilds had about 10 people who zoned in to take
down Yael and agreed to take me to see Polzin (right on the way).  They
joked that I should take Yael's first Death Touch, but I jumped at the
chance to repay their kindness.
