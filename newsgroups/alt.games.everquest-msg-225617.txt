I think south is the only hero shrine that doesn't have any roamers.

Depending on what it's called on your server, the buildings with a
basement also make good exp spots. If you know the south hero shrine,
keep going straight past the 3 wrulons instead of turning right to the
hero shrine to get to them. Once you get inside the building, you'll
probably have to fight your way down since the white suits can see
invis.  You can set up in the middle of the first basement room in any
of the basements (afaik). Human mobs won't mitigate slow but all of
the armor models do. If you get to the basements, the white suits are
the ones that can drop loot (girdle of mithanil, some int caster
bracer and <I think> the windblade), 

Not much else to tell. I much prefer tactics these days for exp, it's
not quite as boring.
