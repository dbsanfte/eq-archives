I've heard that the big break-point is somewhere around 160-170, which 
matches, what I've seen.  I KNOW that with my normal AC gear I sit about 
60 FR/CR.  That should be about the same as 310 or so if the rollover bug 
exists.  Wanna bet characters that you will see a VERY OBVIOUS difference 
in resists over time at 60FR/CR and 300FR/CR?  
Next time you're there (hell, you're a monk, go today), strip down to as 
low FR/CR as you can get without removing AC gear and see how often you 
resist.  Then get buffed up to 260 or so (which according to the lore 
means you have an effective FR/CR of 5) and notice that you get hit a LOT 
less.  The difference between 180 and 255 is not that great, which fits 
with the Verant pattern of a soft-cap, though it's relatively low.
We all know the RNG leads to strings high or low resists.  I'm talking 
about over time.  
As a bard, especially one with AE resists, I really think I would have 
noticed something as obvious at 256 FR/CR=0 FR/CR, especially with as much 
time as I've spent in ToV and VP.
