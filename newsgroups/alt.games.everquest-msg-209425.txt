An alternative strategy:  Convince the Druid to cast an ATK debuff so
that it lands just after the slow.  The other night in Nadox the only
thing that seemed to piss the mobs off more than a resisted slow was
Fixation of Ro.  Of course, there wasn't really room to kite there so
I ended up rooting (and rerooting, and rerooting...) the mobs because
neither I nor the Shaman was particularly keen on taking a dirt nap.
Anyhow, as far as mob hate it seemed to be:
Fixation of Ro > resisted Slow > Snare > most anything else.
So, you see, Druids have more value than you thought :-p
(Hmm, we had no Enchanter, I wonder where Tash fits in there...)
