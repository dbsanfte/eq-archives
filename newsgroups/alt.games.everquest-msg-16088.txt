Well do like I did. All the friends I had in the beginning just went up at
amazing speeds. At higher levels they dropped a bit in speed, but so did I.
I play a lot but like to do quests or help out newbies so I don't get exp
very fast. Now I'm in a guild with only a few around my level and lots
beneath it. I can take it easy while the rest catches up and if they surpass
me big time I just play with the ones who are below them. The guilds keeps
contact and an (almost) unlimited supply of guys who want to play with me :)

For a good hunting spot at 12 you might consider NRo or WC for derv camps.
The groups there are usually in a constant flux so you won't have to wait
long before getting in one. The dervs drop bronze on occasion and the exp is
good. Try Derv 2 in NRo and when bored take down some ghouls and skellies at
the nearby ruins. Or go for the camp in WC and kill a willo from time to
time.

You could also go to Kunark and hunt in LOIO, but I personally don't like
that zone.
