    I'm in shock.  Today...just doesn't seem real.  I
keep thinking that I'll wake up soon and find out that 
this has been a nightmare.  
    I live in San Diego.  I don't have any family on 
East Coast.  I'm fairly certain that no one I know or
love has been a victim today.  Still, I feel like I've
been sucker punched, all my breath is gone, and... I
hate to beat the word "nightmare" to death, but no 
other word comes close.
   I'm not an especially emotional woman.  Still when
I saw the video of the WTC towers collapsing, looking
like the footage of Las Vegas hotels being imploded
but know that those towers were much bigger, and full
of people, I cried.  And I feel like crying now.
I don't have the capacity to imagine how the millions
of people who actually had ties to those who were 
victimized feel.
    I don't really have a point here.  I am a little
disgusted that some elements here pounced on this
tragedy as a platform to launch yet another round of
juvenile name-calling, but not really surprised.
