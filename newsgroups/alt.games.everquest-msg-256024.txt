Went through tipt tonight and got flagged. Luckily we had a paladin who has
a few hundred extra hp than me to tank, because about half the mobs present
would have mashed me flat (several did in fact), whereas he can at least
stun them. (they also occasionally smashed him flat as well, we only had one
healer)

I surprised myself with just over 7,800hp buffed with virtue, shammy, pal/sk
spells. Leadership AA's may have attrtibuted to this, not sure. The pally
had well over 8k and was using tribute on top - and I realised that I'll be
over 8k the minute I track down Cloak of Luclin (now that it's been
de-nerfed) and use tribute myself.

Despite that, we almost certainly would have lost if we didn't have a ranger
to tank the last named, and, you guessed it, a chanter to charm one of those
nice ludicrous-dps mobs.

I clocked the hasted pet at around about 2k dps per fight, on average.
That's as much as a small raid. Most fights lasted between 8 and 15 seconds.

I had absolutely no purpose whateover during the entire exercise, aside from
distracting the pet when it broke charm, which occasionally may have helped
a bit, but cost me at least one death. To my guildmates' amusement I
declared my position in the group to be "backup exp leech". Speaking of
experience..... the DPS of a small raid focused on mobs that are white and
yellow to you is extremely beneficial for your AA bar. I look forward to
similar future events.

We did have a lot of trouble with the last named though, and if I remember
correctly roughly three wipes, each of which was saved by the necro, who
managed to feign and then rez the cleric. I managed to feign once, but got
up again to pull a mob off someone else (just could not learn that I was not
a viable tank anymore).

Aside from the really hard hitting mobs and fabulous experience, the event
itself was possibly the most soul-less and boring thing EQ has ever thrown
at me. Using a charmed giant iguana to blat aliens and freaky demons in
order to hail a weird looking guy and have yellow "you have recieved a
temporary character flag" text come up, is not in the least bit interesting,
and about as immersive as a sneezing fit.

Two thumbs down for the tipt trial, but at least it and other ultra-hurty
dps events excellently illustrate the tank balancing issues that I've been
whining about for months ;)

Cheers,
James
