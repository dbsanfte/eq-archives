	I'm sure someone would find a way.

	Making the stuff no-drop only compounds the problem anyway.  Crafters are 
upset now because they are being asked to craft AV-21 speeders and then watch 
Commandos and BH's drive away in them.  They can't get those speeders 
themselves.  At least now they could try to negotiate for a schematic and 
power plant in exchange for crafting one, or buy them on the open market.  If 
the stuff's no-drop, then crafters are totally locked out of ever owning it 
themselves, and they're just the butt monkeys who put it together.

	The simple fact is that Dropped Loot Is Dropped Loot.  Making someone click 
on it before it can be used doesn't make it a Crafted Item instead.  That's 
just a bone thrown to crafters, and they know it.

	Honestly, I have no idea.  I did tradeskills in UO and EQ to bring in some 
extra cash and to get a chance to socialize without trying to chat during 
combat.  Trade skills are a great side dish in a mud, but they're a lousy main 
course.  I think the only way to provide a viable crafting game is to have 
crafters playing their own PvE game against an NPC market, with sales to other 
PCs as a diversion.

	See, that's just not true.  Plenty of people were satisfied with EQ, and many 
of them still are.  People stampeded out of UO for it, despite the fact that 
on paper UO should have been the better game.  People don't want to be lab 
rats in someone's sociology experiment.  They don't want to be Sims in 
someone's game of Sim City.  They don't want virtual jobs, and they absolutely 
don't want to be virtual cops, and NFW do they want to be virtual victims. 
They just want a virtual amusement park they can log in to for some 
socialization and to blow off some steam by stomping bad guys.

	Look at City of Heroes.  You can log in, grab some friends, get a mission and 
do the boot-to-the-head thing on some neo-Nazis or demon cultists or whatever, 
and you're done in an hour.  Then you can do it again or log into RL for a 
chance without feeling that you're falling behind the curve in the game.  No 
camping, no must-have loot items that take dozens or hundreds of hours to get, 
very little problem with contested spawns and no virtual jobs.  And people are 
jumping all over it, because its devs made sure "fun" was part of the 
equation, unlike SWG, which in the words of Computer Gaming World is "a 
souless compendium of game design theories masquerading as entertainment".

	That remains to be seen.
