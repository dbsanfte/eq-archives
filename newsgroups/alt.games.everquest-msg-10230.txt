On this occasion I was making sure Bizbee saw it. The side-effect was
you (and a few other misguided people) saw it to. My apologies.

He has been for a long time. I took him (and you and a few other
misguided people) out when A.Melon posted his revelations a couple of
days ago. I wanted one last attempt at getting an explanation from
Bizbee before consigning him (and a few other misguided people) back
in my KF.

I'll remember that next time I see you (thru replies) dictating to
others.

I flame in retaliation... I don't actually make a hobby out of it nor
do I get immense gratification from flame-wars as Bizbee seems to.

You, too, reside in killfiles.

Good point. Up to a point. Bizbee's behaviour towards new arrivals
actively *harms* this newsgroup. I find that hard to ignore <shrug>

I'm assuming you left me out of your KF long enough for me to reply?
