This was my hypothesis as well, but I'm not ashamed to say I just ran a test and
I'm quite wrong, at least at zero experience.

I'll start a seperate thread for this.

I agree right down the line on this, however I seem to be incorrect in assuming
that a troll shaman with lots of stamina would have more HP than a woodie ranger
with nothing in stamina.  That doesn't preclude having a look at actual stats of
your party mates before nominating them based on class, though.

This too is a good attitude; Paax isn't tanking because he's a troll shaman, he's
tanking because he's a big bad shrunken troll that -laughs- in the face of a
beating and would sooner take the hits and grow the  cuts over with his trollness
than have to go healing those pathetic wimp races that have to have magic or a
weak in a hospital bed every time they get their left arm chopped off!  And STOP
healing me already, with your Mithaniel "hope you get lucky and this heal lands"
gods and all.  I Hate that!

Many a person has said to me "my friends' shaman doesn't do that... and it turns
out they are talking about some kilt clad barbie doll of a shaman with sufficient
wisdom to prefer sitting down to wading in and chewing armor off the tender flesh
of the prey with their bare teeth.

Remember that lead orc in the final fight scene of the Fellowship movie, taking a
spear to the chest, grabbing it and pulling it in deeper while snarling his
contempt for Aragorn?  Thats Paax... of course then the ranger pulls out his high
DPS and slices the Uruk Hai's arm off and then lops his head off... but heck,
thats what clerics are for, to rez us after we fail, but hopefully fail with
style!

Paax,30 shaman, Morel Thule
