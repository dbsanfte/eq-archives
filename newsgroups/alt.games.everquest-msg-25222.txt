Although pretty much covered already, the path down into BlackBurrow (the
tunnel that leads to the rest area by the bridge) is notorious for losing
corpses in. This has happened to a few of my characters before. If you die
there and you cannot find your corpse it has fallen thru the wall and will
now be in a "safe" area, although cannot prolly see it there (oddly, others
often can) Walk from the doorway of that tunnel to the zone to QHills while
tapping your /corpse HotKey. Zig Zag to cover as much ground as possible. At
some point, normally real close to the zone (as your husbands was) but on
occasion half way between the two you will get the message "Summoning
Corpse" and it will appear. Don't ask me why it disappears from view, I have
no idea. I have know similar things to happen, elsewhere but not for the
corpse to be invisible to the owner. Just another unique feature of Black
Burrow, I guess.

Hehe, Frustration? You don't know the half of it.
I think everyone playing has, at some point, questioned WHY? but since you
will likely log back on to play at the first oppotunity available to you, it
will become apparent why you pay the money...either that or you will stop
paying and stop playing.
