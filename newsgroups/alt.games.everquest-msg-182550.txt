If you're soloing a lot, you'll need a large mana pool for your nukes.
You'll want to invest in some HP + Mana, and maybe some type of mana
regen, items only (like velium jaded rings). Wisdom won't mean as much
to you than compared to Mana bonus items in younger levels.

If you're grouping a lot, invest in Wisdom + Mana bonus items instead.
Whatever you can afford.
