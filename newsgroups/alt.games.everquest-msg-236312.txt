}Crushbone (off of Greater Feydark) is a good place for you to continue to 
}level up for a while and you can probably still find groups there. You 
}can get there from Plane of Knowledge by just taking the Kelethin stone.

UNLESS you're an evil race.  If you're an evil race, killing crushbone 
orcs messes up neriak warrior's guild faction, which makes Neriak Commons 
rather annoying and dangerous to visit.

Might not be exceptionally important to you, but I've always found it a 
cool place to hang out. :)
