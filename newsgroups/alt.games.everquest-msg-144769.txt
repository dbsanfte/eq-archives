Hence, regulation is not inherently socialist.

The nice thing is, though, that the State isn't one of those corporate
monsters.  Or, at least it shouldn't be.  With the various forms of
collectivist governments, it is.

It's alot easier to find a different charity than it is to pick a new
government.  Also, if those charities are fiscally irresponsible, they go
away.  If the government is fiscally irresponsible, they raise taxes.
