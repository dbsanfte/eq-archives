Report him to the Guild Leader you might get some satisfaction, Also don't
hesitate to exchange a shout every now and then if you happen to be in the
same zone. I had group member ninja loot an FBSS from me once after a few

of groups he was offering me twice the going rate to shut up. Which I had
refused I believe he transferred servers or quit playing the character. Yes
I believe in holding a grudge.
