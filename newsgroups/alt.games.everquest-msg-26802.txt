I'm not "throwing a blanket over everyone who dares play Quake and
EQ". I'm throwing one over those who have the same clan/guild for both
games. They are two totally different genres. Crossing over between
the two simply says, imo, that you can't tell the difference.

I have yet to hear of a single guild that doesn't hold true to what I
say. The crossover clan/guilds are almost always uberguilds who are
filled with hyperactive 133t d3wdz. FoH is the rule rather than the
exception in my experience.
