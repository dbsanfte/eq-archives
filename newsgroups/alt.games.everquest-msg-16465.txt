He's on one of the "Zek" (PvP) servers.  Droppable equipment
is always at risk of being "stolen" by the person who killed
you, and haste items are highly prized, thus might be the
most likely thing to be taken (on an "item-lootable" PvP server,
the player-killer can only choose one item to loot).

But with a No Drop haste item, it's yours forever, never
at risk of being taken from you the next time you get killed.
