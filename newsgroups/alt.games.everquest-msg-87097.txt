Actually not really .Most of the good chanters started before breeze .
Chanters as a whole level slowly and die lots to mistakes others make. What
a good chanter gets is a group anywhere at anytime he wants. Warriors,
clerics and rogues get this also to a lesser extent.

Oddly enough of my 3 characters the chanter was easiest to level from 50-60.
My druid is still stuck in 58 and I started him as my first character. My
monk was pathetically easy to level up to 45 or so due to a good twinking
but has now slowed down to the normal progression and is currently 53.

On the whole though I would have to say my druid was the hardest to level.
He is also the least usefull in raids unless there are NO other druids
around (which is actually happening now with some regularity, druids are
dissappearing)
