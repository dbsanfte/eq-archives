The house in Unrest is starting to go cyan -- I'll need a new solo ground
soon.  Any suggestions?

I've got a strong preference for zones heavy on undead (obviously -- hunting
with Ghoulbane, Expusle Undead, and Instrument of Nife has that affect on
most people), and am not put off by zones with a reputation for being train
stations (I can and have managed Unrest solo since my early teens, and my
warrior has soloed Mistmoore).

Ideas?

Binaryeyes.
