It's a 200pt proc, they have to be in melee with you to do it.  They
proc very often, either root/dot them or chain stun them (they will
crush a solo Paladin, but will hardly make a pair of Paladins break
a sweat, for example).  Have See Invis, some like to Invis themselves
(or maybe they just Hide, not sure) when standing at their spawn points.
