Let's be clear:  there are *four* types of 'regular' fights.

These are solo and group encounters, both of which can
have either single or multiple mobs.   IOW, you can have a
group of mobs (two or more) which are designed for solo
players and a group of mobs which are designed for a group
of players.   And, of course, single mobs which are designed
for solo players and single mobs which are designed for a
group of players.

A conjurer (and plenty of other classes) have trouble when
they try to solo group encounters which consist of multiple
mobs.   The peak damage output of this type of encounter
is too high.   A guardian (or any type with high damage
mitigation) may have more luck simply because they can
take the peak damage better.

However, most characters (all I've tried anyway) can solo
group encounters which consist of single mobs.  Certainly
when they're green, often when they're blue, and sometimes
even when they're white/yellow.   Conjurers certainly can;
the pet has excellent taunt and the conjurer just sits back
and nukes/heals as needed.

At any rate -- I think it's important to clarify what's being
talked about -- whether it's a group of mobs or a single
mob characterized as a group encounter.   Certainly the
"group of mobs which are designed for a group of players"
are tough for all classes to solo when they're white/yellow.
And, for some, that's even true when they're green.  But
I've yet to see a class that couldn't solo a "single mob
designed for a group of players" once it was green (and,
in my experience, when it was blue.)
