Its amazing how many people will sit around begging for sow, when there is
little danger, and not all that far to run. Ive even had people /rude me,
because I wouldnt teleport them from ec to lava for a cr... and pay after he
finds his corpse (Im level 56, he should know better). I dont mind running
through several zones, but I do find waiting for boats irritating.
