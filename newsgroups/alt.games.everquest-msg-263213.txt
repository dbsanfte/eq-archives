I thought invis only broke charm because you couldn't have a pet while 
invised. But your right it is a separate case so its worth testing.

Before the insta clicky I used regular invis, cancel magic has some 
other issues because charm might not be the first thing to get wiped so 
it takes even longer.

Timing a charm break with pinpoint precision is **very** useful. It 
looks like the best we can get is 3 seconds, possibly many more than 
that depending on the state of the mob. And it ties up a spell gem.

Is there a reasonable limitless clicky cancel magic floating around?
