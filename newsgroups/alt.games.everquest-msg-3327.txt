I usually snared, and kited with expulse summon, experience
rolled in, remember the lava crawlers are a summoned mob,
and IMHO tend to be over conned.  

If "summoned" mobs became scarce, i would cast shield of
thistles (i think thats the right one), root, dot a dervish,
and when root broke, would pincushion it to death.  Stay
away from the drakes, and basilisks, cause of the breath
weapons.
