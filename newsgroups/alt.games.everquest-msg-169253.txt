Posted earlier about a latency issue I was having and since I have fixed it
and I noticed others were having the same issues, I thought I'd share the
info.

Turns out my Video Card and Sound Card were sharing the same IRQ.  Now this
normally isn't a big deal using an APIC enabled OS (meaning it allows
multiple peripherals to share the same IRQ and channels them all), in other
words broken as intended.  But with the two devices being two of the busiest
in the system my theory is when too much was happening in the game, they
would conflict causing my Network Card to not get the resources it needed,
and hence the latency.

Now in old windows (98 and past) changing IRQ's was relatively easy.  But
with APIC enabled (can't remember what this stands for, just know that it is
the normal and best setting for XP) once IRQ's are set, they can't be
changed, and even if you make changes in the BIOS, the OS ignores those
settings totally.  Quite nice of XP if you ask me (sarcasm intended).

So what I did was move my SoundCard to a different PCI slot (had to
experiment since certain ones were locked with internal devices) until I
found one that everything worked and allowed the two cards to be on
different IRQ's.  In the process I crashed my computer, but that was because
of something else I did, but STILL backup everything you can before messing
with this if you are going to attempt this fix.  Wasn't too big a deal for
me since I have two hard drives and I had all my media files on the second
drive and had just done a backup before trying all of this (since I have a
tendancy to crash my own computer when working in the grit of it), so was a
simple reinstall of XP, all drivers, and EQ (will install everything else
when I actually want to use it, read: NEVER).

So, if anyone else is having this problem, check and see what devices are
sharing what IRQ's?

1. Right Click on My Computer
2. Choose Properties
3. Go to Hardware Tab
4. Click on Device Manager
5. Click on View in the Menu Bar and choose View Resources By Type
6. Read the list.

It's gonna be normal for certain devices to share IRQ's (currently two
different USB Controllers are sharing with the Sound Card and Video Card
each) but look for any MAJOR components sharing IRQ's and work on that.
Will probably fix the problem.  Did for me at least.
