I lost confidence in SOE's ability to realistically manage EQ, certainly in
regard to plat duping, some time ago.  There was talk on several boards
within the past couple of weeks about plat prices dropping again due to
another "dupe" bug.  This is a portion of a post on Monkly Business from an
SOE employee:

*************************************************
"As for post-expansion bug fixes, how it was described above isn't how it
works. As one of the programmers I have some involvement with this, much
more than the QA person who gave that bad info. Generally, whoever wrote a
feature is responsible for it. Most of the code usually works after it
leaves test and this usually means most of the coders move on to new stuff.
Bugs of course do happen and the logical person to fix something is the
person who wrote it, otherwise ***someone who never even looked at a piece
of code would have to learn what it was supposed to do before they could fix
it.***  That is inefficient so we avoid that when we can. Besides, nobody
likes fixing other peoples bugs and nobody like knowing their bugs had to be
fixed by someone else (it's rather embarassing) so we're pretty motivated to
make sure problems in areas of our responsibility are resolved as quickly as
possible." [emphasis mine]

*************************************************

What this says to me is that you have a bunch of people left on their own to
code features with little oversight beyond the (IMO) modest testing that
goes on before release.  Person A codes Feature X and person A is the only
person intimately familiar with that code.  That leaves a huge potential for
intentional abuse or unintentional fault.  There isn't a Person B who does a
thorough check of Person A's code to keep Person A both sharp and honest.
In fact, it seems to be SOE's policy to discourage anyone except Person A
from ever looking at the code once it's implemented provided that the code
either works without obvious bug or Person A is around to fix it.  The
natural check for this individual coding would be a rigorous testing
process, but I don't know many people who believe that's the case at SOE.

Reading the article, I think some kind of relationship is bound to develop.
This is what Kramer says earlier in the article:

*************************************************
Begin article quote
And still others, like EverQuest publisher Sony Online Entertainment, see
such trafficking as nothing but a headache.

"The official line is that the selling of characters, items or equipment in
EverQuest goes against our end-user licensing agreement," says Sony Online
Director of Public Relations Chris Kramer. "It's currently not something the
company supports and causes us more customer-service and game-balancing
problems than probably anything else that happens within the game."

End article quote

*************************************************
Notice the wording.  "It's *currently* not something the company
supports..."

*************************************************
Begin article quote
Kramer adds that Sony Online's objections are based mostly on the idea that
such trafficking isn't fair to players who've spent countless hours in the
game.

"From a design perspective, our developers don't like it, because
essentially what it comes down to is it rewards the rich. It sort of cheapen
s the experience for people who have invested the time in the game to get to
a certain level.

"We have people who have been playing for a number of years in EverQuest,"
he continues. "They've invested a large number of hours into creating their
character, (and) amassing a small fortune in platinum. To have a person who
has spent that much time and effort turn around and see someone else who has
a character with equal abilities who has done nothing more than buy it on
eBay, it turns off a lot of our players."

End article quote
*************************************************

After all that talk about how unfair it is, we then have the line the
article:

*************************************************
Kramer says Sony Online has talked with IGE about possibly forming a
partnership in the future, but that for now, no such plans are in the works.
*************************************************

That to me suggests that, while SOE finds the buying and selling of
accounts, equipment and plat objectionable, they don't have much power to
realistically stop it and can't bury their heads in the sand about it much
longer.  One thing I will say is that the last quote from the article is not
a direct quote from Kramer, so we don't know exactly what his exact words on
the matter.  As you suggested, it could be a misunderstanding or
misinterpretation.  If this article makes it way around the various class
bulletin boards, I expect it to create an uproar and Kramer to issue a
statement that SOE and IGE have never talked about a partnership.  Then, 6
to 12 months later, I expect the announcement of just such a partnership.
