60Hz is also synchronous with A/C current switching rate (in North 
America at least) and is the refresh rate on your regular old 
televisions largely because it is 'adequate' and electrically convenient.

FWIW - In Europe the PAL format is at 50Hz.

Nobody has ever, in my memory, complained that the refresh rate on their 
television was inadequate on either continent.

Clearly anything over even 50fps is nothing to get that excited about.
