I find it humorous that about once a month, this thread appears and the same
drawn out argument appears and in addition, the same few people get involved,
call people morons or hall monitors.  They gloat about their being "correct" in
reporting a naming violation or how some peoples names are stupid.   The thread
will invariably last for a while off and on, but when the argument ceases,
nothing has changed.  

History always repeats itself
