I don't believe it needs to be named giants in Kael to improve the faction,
I appear to be getting better faction with the dwarves and dragons any time
I kill any giant.  I've been spending my time lately killing frost giants
and frost giant savages in the Eastern Wastes and I get a faction
improvement every time.  I'm wondering how many I need to kill before I get
good faction with the dragons.

I'm not sure about Wuoshi though.  Have heard varying things about him, but
don't have actual experience with him.
