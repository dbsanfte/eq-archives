I hope he's not saying that it's better to buy your character than to
advance a character yourself and then twink a secondary character you
create.  I think if anybody has played this game for an extended period of
time, he or she probably has had the urge to start a new character.  If you
want to give that charachter a little boost, great...if not, also great.
Buying a twinked character seems far less noble since you did nothing to
earn the possessions on your new character.  But that's just my opinion.

Definitely incorrect.  There are many players willing to lend a hand.  Will
they all drop whatever they are doing to help? Probably not.  If it's even
semi-convenient, I will go out of my way to help someone in need.  I draw
the line at beggars, though.  If you beg for money or equipment, you won't
be hearing from me again.

The original poster failed to mention how willing he would be to help other
when they are in need.  Some players are jerks and aren't worthy of help.
Most are decent people just trying to enjoy the game.  If you refrain from
being abrasive, you'll probably convince someone to help you out.  Just be
coginzant of the fact that others are playing the game for themselves, not
just to sit around and help the floundering few.
