	A 6/150 arrow is a Class 2 Steel Silver Tipped Arrow, and costs about 12
pp per stack to make.

|Doesn't that get a bit expensive fast?  

	Pfft, plat's not that hard to come by.

	Now that I'm out of acrylia (again) I'll probably do the same thing with
the Class 2's I was doing with the Shadow arrows: fill the quiver with the
Class 2's and keep a stack of summoned in the arrow slot, switching to the
better arrows when the situation calls for them.
