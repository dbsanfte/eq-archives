Mend Companion is a Luclin AA (cost 5). The upgrades for it (Hasted
Mending 1-2-3, 2 aa per level; reduces refreshtime by 25% per level)
are PoP aa's.

And yes they are worth it, both mend as the refresh reducers. Instant
and manaless heal is very usefull in many situations. It's only a 2k
heal though, nowhere near a CH (Rathe's Son has buffed over 8k hp).
