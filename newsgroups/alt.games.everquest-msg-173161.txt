24 state inspired coups?  like americans rebelling to take over states?
Indicted by the UN?  We are still part of the UN.  There is no way we would
allow weapon inspectors into the US.  If you wonder what weapons we have,
presume we got them.  We are a world power.

Alaska is an untapped resource for oil for the US.  If we really needed oil,
we could tap into that, and we don't need to go to war for our energy needs.
