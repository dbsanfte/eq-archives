We are not looking into your bags and backpacks (which is the closest
stretch to your analogy of looking your house).  We are seeing you
walking down the street in that sweet ass Tommy Hilfiger Sweatshirt
and skin tight Levi's sporting that Gold Rolex.  We can SEE it without
doing anything invasive.  It is only that the game doesnt have a
unique graphic for every tiny item.  And the fact that the same item
looks different on different people doesnt help either.
