Well, first of all, at lvl 16, you shouldn't be grouping in one of the
Commons (well, WC maybe, but not EC); the experience when hunting the Orcs
at that level will pretty much suck. Move on to North Ro and join a group at
one of the Derv camps (Derv 3 is a good idea, because its closest to the
tunnel into EC), or join a Croc or Derv group in Oasis of Marr. (If you
don't mind the possibility of getting ambushed and killed by Sand Giants or
Spectres, that is -Keep a look out for Specs and SG at all times in Oasis;
Drybones Skeletons, too)

Second of all, you were clearly grouped with idiots. Unless an Orc group
doesn't have AT LEAST three good melee fighters (and that includes pets
except the Enchanter pet, which sucks rocks), Clerics just stand well away
from the fighting and do nothing but heal and root (and Druids should just
heal, buff, and cast area effect spells). And anyone who loots in the middle
of a fight shouldn't be grouping in the first place.
