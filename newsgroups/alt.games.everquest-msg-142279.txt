A 2h limits their attacks

In the old days of killing Bro Z for the monk epic, you would hand him a 2hb
that he would wield, which cut his dps down drastically.

I don't remember where I read it, but i know for sure I read a long time
ago, that giving a pet a weapon that was < the pets h2h, that the pet would
still use the h2h dmg/delay.

They stopped weapon delays from effecting pets attack delay, if the weapon
was 10/20 and the pets h2h was 7/22, then you would hit at 10/22.. but if
the weapon was 1/9, you would hit at 7/22

Regardless of ratio, I don't ever give my pets a 2h weapon, tho I did used
to always give them the 1h FS junk that gornit often dropped.
