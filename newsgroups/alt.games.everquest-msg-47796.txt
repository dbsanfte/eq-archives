Some of my own wish list items:

*Vestments for clerics.  Robes, dalmatics, mitres, etc. that are appropriate
for wear during ceremonies (weddings, guild knightings, etc.)  They don't
have to give stats, nor do they have to be uber items-- just something to
wear that looks nice, impressive, and specifically clerical...for those
special occasions.

*Replace the shouting Port Authority with a simple maritime bell sounding
when the boat arrives in-zone.  (I find the timing of the Port Authority
shoutings in Qeynos to be next to worthless, and the Port Authority in
Erudin just teases you half the time with the announcement that you just
missed it....)  The bell would help those under 35 who sit and med on the
docks, especially on corpse runs when trying to re-mem spells.

*Make a large container that can hold 10 or more giant sized items.  Can be
an incredibly huge pottery-made jar or urn that would be too heavy to use
for any purpose other than banking.  If pottery-made, it would increase the
incentive for players to learn the Pottery trade, and would increase the
usefulness of the skill.
