with my ranger...
which means i finally get dual wield!!

i already have that gnoll hide lariat to get my skill up quickly...

but!

i've just bought a PGT and it seems my stamina is dropping quickly (well...
more than it used to) in long/multiple fights...
which ofcourse isn't a good thing...

how does dual wielding affect your stamina?
i was planning on dual wielding my PGT (in secondary) and a berserker's
axe... but that one is even heavier...
how can you slow stamina drain? just by getting +STA gear (any suggestions?
i have +- 140pp right now)
or should i sell and find other weapons?

Basicly, i'm ok with all my other gear, i think...
i've got an executioners hood, brigandine tunic, bracer of errolisi, and an
orc fang earring... kindly donated by some high level druid...
(sitting on the dock in oasis, this guy suddenly gives me all that stuff...
i was stunned!)

any help would be appreciated... ;-)
