Anybody can solo to 65.  Not everybody should.  :)  There are still dark
blue mobs that I can solo as a 65 monk, but it's slow, risky, slow, slow,
risky and slow.  Oh yeah, and slow.

My latest twink-of-the-month is a bard, who has gotten to level 32 in less
than that many hours.  I started out pretty clueless on how to operate a
bard, and initially had just the spell gems hotkeyed.  God I'm glad I
figured out how to macro the two clicks into one.  Before the macros I could
get 3 songs running non-stop.  After macros, I can run 4 non-stop, 5 if I
use the longer-lasting amplification.  I've got a good connection and a
supercomputer and for the life of me I can't figure out how guild bards can
get 5 and 6 buffs to show up at the same time.  :)

I did figure out how to solve some problems by throwing platinum at them.  A
troubadour's mace and gem inlaid longsword make a pretty good weapon set for
a bard.  :)  Now if I could just find a wind-instrument weapon.
