My friend had the same problem, only difference was that he only had
10min before freezing.  I suspects its due to you having a larger
system, so the resources don't get filled up so fast.  He was using
WinMe.

The only fix was to do a full re-install of windows98.  We didn't even
try to reinstall winMe, since it didn't do much for us and we knew 98
would work.
