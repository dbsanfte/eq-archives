A: Because everytime a ranger dies, Tunare sheds a tear.
Q: How can you tell a ranger tried to break into your house??
A: Your cat is camping his corpse.
Q: Why don't rangers get FD?
A: Because the fall to the ground would kill them.
Q: What do you call a Warrior with no arms and no legs?
A: I don't know, but it's better than a Ranger.
Q: How do you know when a ranger has been tanking?
A: You're on CR.
Q: Why is ranger armor green and brown?
A: Green so they can find their corpse in the dirt and brown so they can
find
their corpse on the grass.

Q: what do you call a druid that doesnt have any spells and thinks he can
melee?

Q: What did one ranger say to the other at the soulbinder?
A: Do you come here often?
Q: Why did the Ranger cross the road ?
A: Because the chicken got him down to half a bub !
Things to ask rangers :
Ask if they need to get Aego before going in out door zones just in case it
rains and they start losing HP.
Ask them if they've made a "/consent" hotkey yet to save time.
Ask them why they came to this raid, since there will be no need for them to
eat any DT's.

Misc:
Ranger - Tank Simulator

/shout TRAIN TO ZONE!!! RANGERS AND CHILDREN FIRST!!

A_Random_Guildie says, "What does this MOB drop?"
You say, "RANGERS!"

A Ranger walks into a bar.... LOADING PLEASE WAIT.

Just after Kunark was released and epic discusions were rife. General
consensus was that the ranger epic would proc "resurrection".
It's more mana-efficient to res a ranger then heal one.

Monk (pulling): "Incoming, random_mob_o1 times three!!"
Raid Leader: "Off yer butz! Meleers to the front, casters step
back....rangers....try to look as if you are contributing."
