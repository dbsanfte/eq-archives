I will try and dig up some of the literature for you... I have certainly
read some literature on the subject which listed public research that had
been coopted by the private sector and is now subject to private patent.

The US drug companies heartless campaign to stop poorer countries like South
Africa from producing cheaper versions of their drugs to save hundreds of
thousands of lives,  is justified on the basis that they need to recoup the
costs of *their* expensive medical research. So you are absolutely correct
to question the central issue, which is, who actually does the research?
After all, if all they are doing is commercialising other peoples research,
then they have no moral authority to the public protection of patent.

The issue was thrashed out in Australia recently with the US-AU free trade
agreement (so called)  US drug companies wanted to undermine the Australian
pharmaceutical benefits scheme because it delivered cheap medication to the
many rather than the profits for the few.

As a point of comparison; A friend I met on EQ who lives in the US, is
proscribed _the_ most commonly proscribed anti depressant in the US at over
50 USD per month. The same drug costs less than $10 AUD per month in
Australia.

Anyhoo, I will try and dig up some references and post 'em.
