	Well, gee...  I heal the puller because

	It's easy enough to hit DA and the AA heal, or even a group 
heal after the tank locks things down.

	Having the puller die greatly slows down the kill rate.  

	It's still cheaper to heal then it is to rez and rebuff.

	And mostly because I hate to see anyone die even though I know
it's just a game and even in-game deaths don't really matter that much.
