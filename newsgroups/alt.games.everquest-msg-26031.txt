I know what you mean, I didn't even blink when I died
trying to solo a young shardwurm today (I'm a 40 mage,
and I had him under a 1/3rd but my pet was going fast,
and I had to nuke too hard :(  ), in fact I enjoyed the fight.
You never learn your limits in new places unless you dive
in with both feet and take the risk of dying.

But dying when it's not my fault, and no conceibable action
on my part (short of not logging on) could have saved me is
just frustrating.
