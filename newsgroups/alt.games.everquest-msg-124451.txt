Sooo, some informal little conference adopted it...cool, everyone feels
sorry for orphans.  But that means, like, nothing, doesn't it?

Is there any evidence in that long-winded document (redundant, I know, when
it comes to anything remotely political) when CA passed it, and what law it
is?  Does the law (not this NCCUSL document, unless it was passed verbatim
AS law) state how this affects states that haven't made this document into
law?
