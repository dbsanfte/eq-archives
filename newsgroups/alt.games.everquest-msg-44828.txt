Hi,

We are looking for some peeps to moderate our new forums (only launched them
in the last 24 hours).

We are looking for anyone who has a good understanding of Everquest or just
enjoys playing the game.

To apply, go to http://www.gametribe.net and follow the forum link.

We are also holding a draw for a Gameboy Advance and Mario.

Please drop by if you are interested - you might also find our other
services of use to you.

Cheers,

Andy
