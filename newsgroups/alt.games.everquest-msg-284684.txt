Quite true. It has always seemed to me that people largely fall into two 
categories where their interests in MMORPG's are concerned. 

Type A player really gets into the game, immersing themselves, if you will, 
and truly enjoys the game world. They don't focus on their xp bar and take 
great pride in each accomplishment.

Type B plays it like a game - enjoying it no less than the Type A player - 
but looking at it from a much more cursory (I hesitate to use the term, 
"shallow") perspective. The Type B player thrives on killing stuff, looting 
stuff and gaining levels and abilities.

Sure, there are variations of the two types, but I think most players could 
be acurately categorized as one or the other.

If you're a Type A player, I would say EQ still awaits you with open arms. 
It still boasts more content than any two or more other games combined. I 
would recommend the progression servers at this point, unless you prefer 
the raiding game, in which case returning to your existing characters might 
be a good idea. Just be ready to play catch-up.

If you're the Type B player, well, I really can't say for sure, as I don't 
have a good feel for that perspective. I *will* say that, while the grind 
is still there, there are also a lot of different means of minimizing the 
tedium now than just a couple of years ago. I understand there is a patch 
going live soon (this Friday?) that will significantly increase out of 
combat HP and mana regen rates.

EQ is still just the best game in town, IMO.
