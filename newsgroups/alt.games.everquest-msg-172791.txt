Find a place with blue-con scarabs to hunt (not too thick with
wanderers, they are "add social").  Scarabs run slower than PCs
so you can nuke kite them with none of snare, SoW, nor root.  If
your machine (or the zone you hunt) is laggy this might not work,
you don't have a whole lot of slack.  Basicly it goes:
(1) run out of range, (2) try to cast until in range (if you fizzle
run back out of range and try again!), (3) while casting turn in the
direction you are going to run next, (4) as soon as cast finishes
start running, rinse/repeat until mob dies or you have to run for
zone because you're oom (should not happen often, pick another mob
or practice evocation if it does).  Any untwinked and unbuffed Wizard
can get to L12 this way pretty easily (East Commons), tho if you get
adds frequently it can take a little while.  Teen levels seem to be
pretty awful for the ghetto Wizard tho, if you were determined to
continue without twinking you'd probably be wise to pharm 'ling silk
so you could buy gear upgrades, takes more mana to root/nuke once
you have to kill faster targets and/or want to use bigger (thus
slower casting) nukes.  Of course, for a couple hundred pp you could
probably get BOA and KEI and a junk-loot magic pig-sticker (Walrus
Tooth graphic looks pretty cool on an INT caster) and level like mad.
