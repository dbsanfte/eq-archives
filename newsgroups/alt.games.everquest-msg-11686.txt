You have to turn auto-attack off. The same goes for foraging in combat.
I have it hotkeyed for my druid, so I just do 1-3-1 (auto attack off -
forage - auto attack on) and that seems to work fine. There's only been
a couple times when I have gotten the message that I can't forage while
fighting. Usually, though, there is no problem.
