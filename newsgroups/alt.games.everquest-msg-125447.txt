This is very class dependant.  If you are a real healer (cleric) you'll
almost never have a use for this skill.

If you are a pure melee (warrior/monk/rogue) you'll find it indespensible.

Other classes will find the skill lies somewhere in between the two poles.

My bard has a powerful HP regen song series, but still gets a lot of
milage out of bandages; whenever he or his partner is lower than 50%
HP he can get that lower half up very quickly because the bind
wounds doesn't interrupt his song, and stacks with it and with the
bind wounds of his partner.  He can sing heal, hide, bind wounds
while solo and be almost risk free to heal quickly to half, then go
grab a soda afk while healing the rest of the way.  Whenever
passing strangers cast heals on him he laughs at the wasted mana,
he'd surely have been FHP long before they med back the mana
they just wasted.
