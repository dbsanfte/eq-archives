The only way I ever used this was in lockdown mode; chain sing the mez 
as fast as you can manage.  (not let it run, start stopstart stop...) 
Not many mob songs cast in less than three seconds, and even then you 
have 2/3rds odds of stopping them, as they often won't start the spell 
the instant mez is broken.

This means totally losing all other bard output (except for melee), 
which sucks, but there are times when stopping a spell is the best thing 
you can do, and there's nobody else on it.
