 Well I think it is the issue. Rick is frothing at the mouth saying
there has been nothing added for the "true newbie". Just exactly what
should be added do you think? Or to use your phrase, how exactly can
Verant "cater to lower level players"? He's saying nothing has been done
for these people but doesn't give suggestions. I don't think you can
cite trivial code for these people either since most of the "farming"
that goes on does not effect characters of that level.
