My wife and I both run EQ on Win2k Pro SP2. Both machines are with clean
installs and DX8a.

As a matter of fact I have found that I can even Alt-Tab in Win2k.  Find a
safe spot to sit, Alt-Tab, and do my quest research.

Try that in Win9x...

Since Win2k Pro is basically what WinXp is based on, EQ had better run on
it, or there will be trouble.
