Talk about parsing that leaves much to be desired. 9k dps? who the hell are
you kidding. My Am3 EQ Elemental bow equiped ranger only does between 150
and 200dps.

So what exactly is stupid about a ranger using a windblade?
(asks a 65 Hunter who uses a Windblade)
Admittedly at 53rd he may be loosing a point or two of overall damage
because of the recommended level but its still going to be the best two
hander money can buy for him.
And depending on his haste he can probably do more damage with the windblade
than with any dual wield set up.
