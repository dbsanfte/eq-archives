To be fair - It strikes me as rather lacking in intuitiveness for the game
not to actually pop up a message when you try and log on that the servers
are down for maintainence, or changing the LOCKED status to "Scheduled
Downtime" or some other actual meaningful message. Sure he could've found
the answers without asking, but I don't see that it's a terribly user
friendly implementation in the first place. If it made more immediate sense,
less questions would be asked, more people would simply go "Oh I see the
server's down for maintainence", less people would have to go searching
outside of the game. I don't expect people to need to find the answers to
questions relating to basic functionality on software I work on outside the
software.

He didn't whine on about how SOE suxxors, he asked a simple question. He
logged on and saw LOCKED status for his server. You assume he even -has- a
game manual and didn't download the thing from Sony like a few folks do. I
see little wrong in giving someone the benefit of the doubt without jumping
to conclusions, especially when they aren't whining or complaining and the
question wasn't impolite to begin with. Accepting impoliteness only creates
more rude obnoxious posters, it really cuts both ways.
