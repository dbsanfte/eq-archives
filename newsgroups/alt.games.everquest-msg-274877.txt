Ding ding ding ding. We have a winner. Why *didn't* they add/modify 
content to them to keep them interesting as time went by? They could 
have, they should have. Even the boats were originally supposed to have 
merchants and a working bar, they just never got around to implementing 
it.

Instead they just implemented instaports everywhere so you wouldn't have 
to move through the zones they had abandoned, and then after *they* 
abandoned them, we did.

If they had really delivered the 'dyamic world' they promised on the box 
5 years ago it wouldn't still be the same Karanas today.

Not really. We blame Sony for lack of vision. Instead of creating new 
content they create ways to skip old content. Insteda of fixing buggy 
implementations they remove the feature wholesale. (e.g. boats)...
