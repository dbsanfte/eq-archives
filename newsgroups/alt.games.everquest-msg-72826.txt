I do wonder how many people tell me this is not an official
newgroup. You all seem to think verant avoids anything that's
not their official group, even the biggest traffic 'non-official'
one. How come? What does it give you guys to mention this to 
me 50 times?

Mmmh .. I really think you should *read* my posting and not go into
sarcasm mode directly because somebody criticizes something
concerning the classes. There's some content in my posting. Maybe
