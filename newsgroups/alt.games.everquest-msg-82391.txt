The license more-or-less requires that you have a separate account for
each person who plays. However, from a practical standpoint, a single
account can have many, many characters set up, and Verant won't be
able to tell if different people are playing the different characters,
**so long as only one person uses the account at any given time**.

Yes, but you will need to purchase a copy of the software, and pay
separate monthly fees for each account. Accounts are tied to key
codes, which come with the software purchase.

>Can I create multiple accounts on the same computer?

Yes. If you've purchased multiple copies of the software, you will
have multiple accounts and can log on to any of those accounts from
any computer where the software is installed.


I would strongly recommend that you buy a single copy of the original
Everquest (or whatever permutation is cheapest these days) and play
that with one account for awhile to see how you like it before
investing in multiple copies for the whole family.
