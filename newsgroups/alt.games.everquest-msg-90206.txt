They don't.

Its not against the eula, in fact the tech guy said
what was in a thread on the tech board, more or less
giving people license to use eq windows.

You only can't use a program which changes EQ files or is a reverse
engineered program giving you an advantage. EQW is ONLY an exe that
allows you to run POSSIBLY ANY direct x full screen game in a window.
It just happes to be one the guy made to run EQ that way in
particular.

That being said, you should not tell anyone you are running it (even
other players) just in case. You also should have it running from a
different folder from your EQ folder.. just in case. You should also
possibly rename the *.exe file of it, just in case.
