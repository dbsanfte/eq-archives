Of course, reading comprehension is irrelevant when you're rewriting history
to change what you said.   You said "I take over my friend's 52 warrior from
time to time WHEN HE GOES AFK."  (emphasis added).   Whee.  So you've managed
to play a high level (heh) warrior for periods of time up to 5 minutes
straight!

*golf clap*

No need to limit yourself.  I'm sure you suck at all three.

You forgot positioning and aggro control, *the* most important parts.   Case
rested.

Target selection is also pretty damn important, in multi-mob type raids.

Course, you can wipe those port ones off... since this whole thread was you
saying you refuse to do them. ; )

In any event, that wasn't really the point.   As I said, and you most likely
ignored, playing any class well at a raid is a challenge, each in thier own
way.   If you think it's easy being a melee, it's only because you don't
understand well enough what a melee does there.
