It can be done with one bit per item.  Set the bit when the item is
looted.  Clear the bit when the item is given to anyone or sold to a
merchant.  The item can only be turned in for XP (or whatever) if the
bit is set.

In fact, if the existing item flags (MAGIC, NO DROP, LORE, PENDING
LORE, ARTIFACT, RADIOACTIVE) are currently stored independently in the
database, it could be done with *zero* extra space in the database, by
making use of combinations that would otherwise never occur.

For example, these XP items could be marked ARTIFACT and PENDING LORE.
No extra space in the database, then...just code changes where the
flags are interpreted.
