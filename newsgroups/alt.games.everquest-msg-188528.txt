If you're on the Antonious Bayle server, send me a tell if you like.
If I'm only on for an hour or so, I frequently go hunting in Paineel, and 
kick some guards asses. In the mean while, while they spawn again, I 
amuse myself by making some Kiola's :-D
Killing the skeleton guards at the entrance gives me about 50PP in 10 
minutes, and even some minor XP, and then doing Kiola's for 10 minutes is 
usually good for one stack, that I can sell for another 60PP.

All in all its about 200PP per hour I can make in Paineel, by skelly-
whacking, and kiola brewing. With some Xp to boot as well :-)



P.S.
All this with the build in winamp, and some ass kicking music <grin>

I *am* the original poster, but I find it a use of space, just having a 
bazaar mule, without being able to play a class extra :-)
