Okay, I'm stumped.

It used to be you could set your /announce to ON or OFF (for people
leaving/joining chat channels) and it'd stay that way until you changed it.
Now, I have to turn it on every freaking time I log in a new character.
I've tried setting it to TRUE, "TRUE," 1, FALSE, "FALSE," 2 and 0 in my
eqclient.ini, and it still does it.

What'm I missing here, what'm I doing wrong?

B.
