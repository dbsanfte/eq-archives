As a lvl 30 enchanter, I have now begun to collect 2 sets of equipment.
Charisma raising equipment for when
I need to do the charm/mez line of spells (spells that influence NPC's) also
good for buying items for jewelcraft
and INT items for when I group in areas that mez doesnt work. I find myself
wishing for more mana in some
places (INT gear for that) and more influence in others (CHR gear for that)

I don't know any other race that gets that obvious of benefits from
alternate items. Of course, this will only
continue until I can get my jewelry craft up high enough to make items that
raise BOTH my chr and int scores
to an acceptable level. The only exception to all this is the earring I got
from the undead sprites in Lesser Faydark
when it was controlled by evil for about a month. I worked HARD for that
earring and I cannot see giving it up.
I still have 2 charges of force left in it, but the biggest reason is it is
nodrop. I cannot bear destroying an item
that took me so long to get! 8-)

Pride goeth before a fall.   so I will probably have to fall before I
destroy that earring! hehehe
