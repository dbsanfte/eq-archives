I was hunting in Dalnir in my low to mid 30's and I realized that there are
2 type of groups there.  Good and Dead.  I (cleric) had  joined up with 3
monks and a warrior and we were still on the first floor.  I could tell from
there that these guys just did not have the dynamics to survive the 2nd
floor and told them NOT to drop down the well.

Less then 2 minutes later, "guys, I dropped  down to 2nd floor and FD.  Lets
move down."  Now these guys weren't able to single pull the Coerced on the
first floor (and with 3 monks, you expect someone to be a decent puller), so
what chances would I have on the 2nd floor when they all could FD and live.
So, I told them that I was NOT going down, soon I was the only one left on
the first floor.  Disbanded and gated out.

I've been melee before, and you Always listen to the cleric.  If the healer
dies, you all die (typically).  Just thought I'd share a bad group
experience of my own.
