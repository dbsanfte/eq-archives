Like all the other responders, I use the Sense Heading trick and have maxed
out my skill at every level (it's currently at 190). The effect will start
to stabilize your compass, somewhere around 130 or so you'll notice that
it's no longer jumping all over the place.

Do NOT put any points into it, these points will be completely wasted as the
keyboard trick described elsewhere will get you max skill for free. Save
your training points for thing that won't go up fast on their own.
