Most I saw in ours was about 225.  With Win2k, GF2MX400 (64), 768MB PC800
(rambus), most models off (meant to turn them back on 'cause I upgraded
memory yesterday, but forgot) I didn't have much trouble at all moving
around.  Clipping was all the way out as well.

I DID change the bitsperpixel thingy from 16 to 32 and deleted the lines for
UseTNL and that other thingy we all added 6 months ago.  Don't know what
affect that had on me.  I also increased my resolution to 1280x1024x16 in
game (alt-o).

Maybe I'll put my upcoming gf4-4200 in some other computer since this one is
working great with a crappy ol' gf2. :)
