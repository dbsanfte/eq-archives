    Sorry, they made that screw-up the first day of PoP. Just before Luclin
came out there were GM events on all servers, and the people that took part
in them as main characters got the title "of the Nexus" and neckpieces with
right-click Nexus Gate on them. When PoP came out, somehow the Nexus Gate
spell on the neckpieces got turned into gates to Plane of Time. Um, whoops.
