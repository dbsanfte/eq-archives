I've killed Hasten before to get Zephyl to pop (which worked).  I had to
kill 2 Hastens and a few drakes ("a drake").  It's a known spawn cycle with
a 4-hour time-to-live before whatever is up will despawn on its own (handy
when you want Hasten and Zephyl is up, just come back in a couple hours).

Unlike Quillmane and AC which I figured out on my own, I heard this waaaaaay
back in the day when Rathe Mtns was actually an exp zone and it's proved
true for me ever since.

Mobs on the cycle include: "a drake", Brother Zephyl, Sythrak (very rare,
but my little beastlord twink wears a sythrak vest that was looted while I
was getting the beastlord Jboots at level 10), M...  something...  Meldrath?
and some named basilisk (maybe other things I never popped too).
