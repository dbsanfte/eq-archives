That's the whole *point* of using rude words -- because they are rude.  If
they weren't rude and offensive it would be stupid to use them.  In fact
using them without intent to be rude is kind of stupid.  I think what you
want is the right to be rude when you feel like it.  I'm not denying you
that but just the same, you should expect that some people won't like it.
