Safe fall is not foolproof.

SOE is not responsible for things other people, or your ISP, or a dog,
do at your end.

They don't care about any of that either.

I think you just rolled the die and got Joe Super Ultra Nice GM that
day. The best I've had friends get in similar situations is "Yes it is
possible to fall for 20k damage there, good day."

Bizbee is interested because a rez would not be normal SOE policy,
for a player mistake, even if it was your 4 year old third cousin
twice removed.

Are you absolutely sure the GM even said HE'D resurrect you? 
As in did he say, "I will come in and give you a GM resurrect." If he
used the same language that you did, "You CAN get a resurrect if you 
are online." That could mean he is saying a player can give you one.
