Well ram makes games load much faster i tell you.
first i had about 128/100 what was realy slow in eq
then i bought some more now i got 1536/133 and this is going lets say verry
fast
but i still got the lag tho its lower but its still there and real soon i
get a better isp called dsl 2 so zoning and lag then realy get a puch down.

here a small list i got from my guild.

memory-makes you load and zone much faster.
better ISP-makes your lag lower

what helps more is
faster hard drive
better graf. drive-we not compleatly sure about this one.
better cpu - we are not also sure of this 2.

more of our guild cont think of.

i hope it helped.
