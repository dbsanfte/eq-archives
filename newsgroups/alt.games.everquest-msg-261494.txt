LOL Your sales pitch is getting weaker and weaker each time you try, doofus.

Ffs, you trudged away, getting two levels per weekend *then* decided to, er,
'write' a PL guide? Why, your impeccably stellar credentials speak for
themselves, oh Great Keeper of Sacred Secret Knowledge!

I just can't wait to get my hands on this masterpiece.

Come to think of it, I can.

Have at thee, spammer and scammer!
