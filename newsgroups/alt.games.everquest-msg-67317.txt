> I hear this zone is popular...any good loot? What can anyone tell me
about
> it. All I know is that roughly its lvl 20 top end? Is this true.

  Yes, it's primarily good for level 9-18 characters.  After level 20
or so, Ambassador DVinn is probably the only mob who (alone) will
provide much of a challenge.

  The lower level orcs (centurions, legionnaires, slavers) just drop
cloth and rusty weapons, as well as Crushbone belts and legionnaire
bracers for a quest in Kaladim (for decent experience).  Slavers also
drop keys which can be given to the appropriate slaves to free them,
for experience.

  The orc trainer on the hill drops the shiny brass shield, which is a
decent shield for lower level characters.

  Most of the other good drops are found in the "castle".  Emperor
Crush drops the dwarven ringmail tunic, excellent chest protection for
lower level shorties who can wear chain.  It's half of the screaming
mace quest, if I recall correctly... the other drop you need to
complete the quest is the bracer of battle dropped by the orc warlord.

  Other decent drops include a few bronze weapons you might get off
the mobs in the palace, the dwarven axe (both in 1hs and 2hs
varieties) which is one of the better non-magic slashers in the game.

  Ambassador DVinn, who is much tougher than any other mob in the
zone, occasionally drops a dragoon dirk, a nice little piercer, as
well as his heart (not sure what it's for).

  It's not really an attractive zone for a twink because the loot is
rather lackluster, but the nice thing is that a solid lowbie pickup
group can pretty much handle the entire zone, unless there's a bad
train, or DVinn makes an appearance.
