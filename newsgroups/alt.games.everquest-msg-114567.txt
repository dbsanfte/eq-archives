You see, I disagree here.  I think Humans make pretty damned good
rangers.  

Humans have decent starting strength and stamina.  Agi isn't a big
factor because at 15 you get feet like cat which is a nice agi buff
and will easily take you over 100.  Dex is a bit low but you can put a
few points into it, and a lot of ranger gear seems to give dex anyway.

If I were making a human ranger right now, I'd put 10 points into
stamina and 10 into dex.  This would give 80 str, 95 sta, 85 agi, 85
dex, and 80 wis.  Wisdom is a bit low, but in 45 levels I've only
gotten 2 pieces of gear to get my wis to 90, and it's never ever been
a factor.  You need 5 sta to get over the 100 break point, but even
that is fairly easy to get.  The BA girdle has 8ac, 5 sta and sells
for WELL under 100plat.  Hell, you should be able to get it for less
than 50pp at this point.  Str gear is ridiculously easy to get.

Right now, even with screwing up his the starting stats Atticus is at
150str 106sta 115(ish)agi and 110(ish)dex and 90wis.  He solo's great
and I can regularly pull aggro off a level 47 pally with my damage
output.  

Humans lack of night vision is, at worst, moderately annoying.
Nothing to worry about at all.
 
Not only that, but the small races just look so, if you'll pardon the
term, gay.  Wood elves look way too much like pre-pubescent male
models.  Halflings just look silly, which could be a plus or a minus I
guess.  Half Elves looked much cooler under the old models than they
do the new ones.

For me, Human was the only way to go with a ranger.  YMMV.
