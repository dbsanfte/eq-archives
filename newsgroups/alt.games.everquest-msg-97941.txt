While shaman need wis, our mana regen rate is very fast starting at level
24, when we get the cannabalise spell which converts our hp into mana.

This means that while wisdom is important, it is also important to have a
good AC and total HP.

Ie, at level 50 i only have 175 wisdom, compared to my mage friend who has
125 int, but i have 950 AC and 1500 HP. This means that i can tank the mob i
am fighting, and let the pet hit it from behind, while occasionally
regaining mana from cannabalise, with the odd heal thrown in, (slow helps
with this as well :) )
