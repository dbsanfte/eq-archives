Thank you for all your advice. I Plan on beginning my Crafted Quests this
weekend (well, as many as I can do at my level). And I bought Orc Fanged
Earrings as well as a couple of Jagged Bands. This will help me greatly.

Also, for those that asked, I play a Halfling Warrior. Since they only start
off with 80 Strength and 85 Stamina, that is what I dumped all of my points
into when I first rolled the character.

Again, that's for the advice.

Zacheia
