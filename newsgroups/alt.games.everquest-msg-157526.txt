My guild is a raiding guild. If AoW is up, and we have members who need his
loot, then we hit AoW. End of story. A raiding guild is not about getting to
65 asap, but about getting ALL it's members the loots they need to help them
level up and to help the guild as a whole take on tougher mobs.

With permission, I have been permitted to absent myself from a raid to help
a friend acquire their Epic weapon. With permission, if I really need to, I
could also spend some time exping. But for the most parts, all the raiding
guilds on my server require presence at all raids when you are online. If
everyone were allowed to pick and choose which raids they wanted to
attend...the guild might never have the numbers to take out tough mobs. As
it is, some folks have a strange tendency to log off immediately after
seeing that raid target will not have loots for them. Clearly, they are
cheating their guild by doing so.

I understand PoP is special circumstance. But guild rules remain the same.
Had you asked for, and received, permission to explore instead of
raid...that's different. But lacking that, raid on!
