I've found Ultima Online compelling enough to have been playing it for the last
two years, but got bored of Asheron's Call in a week.

The thing I like about UO is that there aren't really any limits on me.  My
warrior took up enough amateur blacksmithy to keep his own gear repaired, a
year after I started him.  A year and a half after I started him, he ditched
parrying to take up archery.  If I really felt like putting a large amount of
effort into it, I could eventually turn him into a mage if I wanted.  Hell, the
only items I've purchased from an NPC over the last six months have been apples
to feed my horse.  The horse itself, my weapons, armor, potions, and food were
all bought from other players, either directly or at player-owned shops.

Asheron's Call, on the other hand, was a bunch of people standing there
whacking monsters and never speaking to one another.  There was nothing
terribly interesting to buy, except armor upgrades from NPC shops.  There were
no horses, much less all the weird shit people ride in UO.  There wasn't even
any goddamn music.  There were just insect noises that kept playing over and
over until you wanted to scream.  I felt like I was deaf, the world was so
mute.  After a week I got so bored that I decided to try and get banned, so I
started paging the customer service people just to cuss them out.  When they'd
materialize in-game I'd run around naked and screaming obscenities.  The wusses
never perma-banned me though, and eventually I just got bored and let the free
month expire.

So will I find EQ interesting or not?  Is there anything to do but powerlevel? 
Are there interesting things to buy?  Will I be able to afford them without
devoting my life to the game?  I know being class-based restricts how much you
can change your character, but can you tinker with it at all?
