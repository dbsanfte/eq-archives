You don't shun them or deguild them Jazz, that way you miss out on all the
fun : )  It's better to watch 'em squirm and grovel for a good while. If
they don't squirm and grovel for long enough then name a wipeout due to
unpreparedness after them...

"Oh shit - we got wiped out last night something shocking. Still - we were
*druids name*'ing it so I guess it goes with the territory"

*grins evilly*
