Last night I pulled my Froggie Paladin (level 2) out of the closet, whom I 
hadn't played in a while. I discovered I had about 40 Spiderling Silks in 
my backpack, which I thought would give me nice money on the bazaar to get 
some basic armour.

After I set up my trader with his tradersatchel and went for a shower, I 
came back to see if he sold some of the silk for the low price of 2.75 PP, 
and discovered to my horror some *freak* cleric casted some absurd high 
level aego spell on me or something, because I suddenly had some shield 
buff icon and an increase of 1100 HP!! Where I alledgedly had about 55....

Needless to say I just *had* to pull my trader offline to put good use to 
this buff :-/

Wouldn't surprise me though if the cleric is now selling Spiderling silk at 
3PP <evil grin>
