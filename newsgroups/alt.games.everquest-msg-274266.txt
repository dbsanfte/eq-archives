Never come accros this problem before, but has been happening since patch 
repair of 31.1 2005

Put simply, I have 2 PCs, both adequate spec, and 2 accounts, but since the 
path, when I "pull a mob" with either char, on either computer, the MOB 
starts to run to me but keeps "warping" back, and trying again. This scene 
is visible on both machines at the same time.

I can watch as a Mob runs straight at me on one screen, and on the other 
screen, I can se it from a diffeent angle doing the same.

Also I have noticed that when i type in my chat windows, there seems to be a 
delay before the text I have written appears in my window.

One thing i did notie was the green dial (F11 activated thingy) was at 100% 
but kept fast changing to 99.something, very very fast before constantly 
switching back to 100% again, this changingin was very fast.

Sorry i cant be better description, but have never come across this before.

Any advice welcome
