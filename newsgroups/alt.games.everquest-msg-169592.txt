Not sure if I understood you correctly (were you saying your Southern Accent
imitation was hard or easy to read?), but I think your rendition of a
Southern accent was quite good as far as it went (not quite accurate but
that doesn't matter, the point is you got an accent across).  However,
you'll notice if you go back and read your post that you put more misspelled
words into it that just a simple "Suh" at the end of your sentences.  Not
only so, but the ratio of correctly spelled/misspelled words in your "Kenny"
quotes was pretty much the same as that of the other posts on this thread,
which posts I was defending.  In other words, something like

"M'a b'tud h'duna wa''msyin."
(I'm a bastard who doesn't know what I'm saying)

is not what I'm talking about.  That's not an accent, that's not even a
language.

But something like "Me naw have da majiks" is perfectly acceptable (not
exactly the OP's quote but I modified it to demonstrate my point), and is
not to be confused with "Mna had'majks".

My point is not that to make yourself entirely incomprehensible is ok, but
that to consistently misspell words is a good way to present a dialect, and
that misspelled words used in that way do not have to be limited to one or
two per paragraph (or even one or two per sentence).  In other words, the
"creative" writing teacher mentioned earlier, though correct in that you
should have clearcut words and sentences so as to be understandable, was
wrong in saying that you shouldn't spell many (or occasionally all, within
limits) of those words to show a way of speaking.

"Suh" at the end of one or two sentences doesn't tell me anything about the
accent, all it tells me is that the speaker either comes from a place where
people don't pronounce the "r" sound, or has a speech impediment.  On the
other hand, "Suh, Ah say, Suh, you have offended mah honah!  Ah am no
Colonel, and Ah resent youah implications!" tells me that the speaker has a
thick Southern accent, probably that of a gentleman since the grammar is
mostly correct (not a mark of an uneducated man) but the pronunciation is
unique to the Southern states of the United States of America.

It also contains more misspelled words than your rendition of that quote
does, yet is still quite readable, and offers a far richer portrait of the
speaker than something like "Sir, I say, Sir, you have offended my honah!  I
am no Colonel, and I resent youah implications!" which makes me think of
someone desperately *trying* to speak a Southern accent and failing
miserably.  Notice the second example uses the "one misspelling near the end
of a sentence" rule put forward earlier.
