Not in my opinion.

Collections / Slaughters would not exist in thier current forms under my
system.

The closest I would add to a collection mission is a mission requiring you
to collect a few items, say between one and five.   The items would only be
found in treasure chests, which would be placed semi-randomly throughout the
dungeon.

The closest I would come to a slaughter mission, you almost wouldn't be able
to leave the entrance.  This is supposed to be a dungeon so full that this
group of adventurers needs real heros to thin them out.   Rooms would be
packed and respawns would be massive.  Groups would be kept on the edge of
wiping out.    Almost more of a ring event than just a dungeon clear.

I don't think many people would keep thier current stance of "I only do
slaughers" under my systems   ; )

*shrug*  The dungeons need to be harder.   They're too easy as is.

Ditching the timer, in conjunction with "no re-entry" changes the difficulty
from "get it done immediately" to "don't die".   It removes the problem of
people being so busy they have no time to socialize and get to know each
other, and allows much more freedom  for non-standard groups, as long as
they are good.

The missions as is suck.  And would be worse under a non-time limited
situation.   They need greater variety, challenge and especially complexity.

Doesn't sound like you really think they're "good as is" to me.

1) Bring a Paladin.
2) Bring a Necromancer.

and the really, really good option...

3)  Don't die.


> Not sure how the cleric gets back in if he wipes?

Either he is resurrected by another player, or the group fails the mission,
gets another and tries again.

If you're unable to get a second person able to rez, then thats good
incentive to keep your cleric alive, I would think.  Watch your play and
don't screw up or you will lose.
