Same with horses.

But while it's incredibly annoying, I can live with that better than
I can the "horse stops dead trying to climb any hill or bump in the
terrain steeper than a wheelchair ramp or higher than a discarded
Coke can" bug that started with the DX9 changes.

It makes my Holy Steed practically worthless.  Thanks, Sony..

And I dare anyone, mounted or not, levitating or not, to try to
cross Mons Letalis now.  The steep gullies and hills used to be
easy to "slide" over while levitated, or climb out of under any
conditions, but now a large number of them are considered by the
new graphics/collision engine to be effectively vertical surfaces,
and you stop dead when you hit them or try to climb them.  You have
to keep backtracking to find the rare slope moderate enough to
actually scale -- and then you find another "wall" beyond it.
