Well, I have to buy RD RAM, because I have one of those "sucky" P4's.  I was
not really into gaming when I bought my new comp this summer, so I didn't
get a "gaming" machine.  I'm glad for you that you could get your RAM so
cheaply, that's great, but it doesn't do jack for me at all.  The fact
remains that RD RAM is still priced quite high for the time, compared to
other types, and no one has been able to find it for under $100 ($98 before
tax, being technical.)
