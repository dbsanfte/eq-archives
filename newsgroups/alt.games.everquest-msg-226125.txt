So if you get 15 warriors together, then the 4% that each mitigates adds 
up to 60% better mitigation?

No, its =not= like those incremental effects, because there's nothing to 
add it to.  Casters get 10% mana preservation plus 10% more damage from 
a nuke; thats additive for a 20% improvement.  Or they can get nuke 
specific items that make the swing even larger.  And AA that add to that 
making the swing larger still, specialization to make it larger than 
that,  and FT items that get you the mana back faster and so on.

Likewise, +hp and +stamina items don't matter all that much 
individually, but put 100 extra HP in 15 locations, plus 10 stamina in 
15 locations, and it adds up to quite a lot. Trouble with this is that 
knights have the same high end gearing options as warriors, pretty much, 
so this gear doesn't add up to a difference between warriors and 
knights.  Gear, as it currently stands, is part of what levels the 
damage taking ability playing field out for the three classes, not what 
sets them apart from each other.  While once a knight might have had 20% 
fewer hp and lower AC, he's now got perhaps 5% fewer.

If the other new stuff for warriors adds well to this increase, then 
thats a different story, but I still have to think this particular 
increment is tiny compared to the increases that casters get with their 
various options.

Splendid
