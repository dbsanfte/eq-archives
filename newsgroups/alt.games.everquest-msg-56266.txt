If you look at it from the powergamer perspective, you can go with Erudite
for the maximum starting INT, or High Elf, for maximum starting INT+CHA.

But for sheer fun, you can't beat playing a Gnome.  You're short, you can
fit in places that other larger races can't, and (as someone told me in
Sebilis one night) you can jump up on a table and look good doing it.

The neutral faction is also a big plus.  Agnostic Gnomes start out being
non-KOS in more places than any other race.

And realistically, the stats aren't that hard to raise.  You get CHA and INT
buffs, and there's inexpensive stuff to raise them as well. Right now, my
Gnome has 201 INT and 201 CHA.

Tinkering is seperate from jewelry.

Enchanters have an advantage at high-end tailoring because that requires
vials of mana which only enchanters can make.  But tailoring is a bitch to
raise...

The starting zones are all good, except Tox (or so I hear).
