    Unless you've healed someone, nothing should be near to you to do this.
When a "clerics camp" is called, it is every non-CR person's duty to train
stuff as far away from camp as possible. If you're being hit a lot, then the
person calling camp didn't call it in time, or the non-essentials aren't
running stuff away from you.

    Also, if you know a hard pull may be coming, don't be afraid to start
camping as soon as you hear the inc. message. 30 seconds is plenty of time
to assess, and either stand and fight or get out. Consider this Hate story:
Maestro dead, still in throne room area. Most areas not pulled. Puller monk
Feigns, tells his cleric OK to heal me. As soon as he does, a WAVE of stuff
charges the cleric.

    I can see the wave coming, I'm already sitting (it's what we do best!),
I hit camp. I'm at 15 seconds when the call to camp comes. Three people out
of 36 or so survived: me, the puller monk, and an ogre warrior AFK beside
the throne. I still remember the warrior saying when he got back and saw the
bodies, "WTF happened here and why aren't I dead?"

    Never works. Don't bother.

>come back dead

    Never works. Don't bother. You also end up with a possibly lost corpse.

>DA
>/q
>come back dead

    I find the trick to this is /q'ing when the buff icon for DA is up. Then
it stays the entire time you're linkdead. I once tanked the King in Chardok
and MANY of his minions for two minutes this way, much to the surprise of
the rest of the raid. As I said later, "It pays to be an AC cleric!" ;-)

>By some miracle, successfully camp out.
>Come back, get jumped by mobs, die.

    This is the job of the monk/rogue who's watching to see when it's safe.
It's their job to make sure the coast is clear. When you get your res stick,
getting a fighting force back quickly will be a LOT easier, and previously
"unsafe" spots will be safe.

    Visual confirmation. You usually have a good idea how many mobs a raid
can handle. If you see more than that, or see Mr. Uber Mob charging your
position BEFORE it was announced he'd be pulled, start the countdown. Can be
tough with a room full of fatties, but lobby to get Lardo shrunk.
