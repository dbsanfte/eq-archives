This is the text from the EQ newsletter sent out last night. See what
you make of it, particularly the second section. Nice to see that
there'll be a whole new zone none of us will get to see unless we're
shelling out forty a month.

Absor's Update
<snip>
Also in this issue of the Harpy's Head Herald, we've included some
interesting tidbits for players, including a forgotten quest that no one
has ever completed, and give you a look at the very first concept work
on the Vah Shir.

Keep exploring Norrath, and most of all, have fun!

The Legends Begin February 22, 2002!

Off a small island between Erudin and Antonica, the mighty ship White
Maelstrom and her crew met an untimely demise. What will follow as a
consequence of that long-ago tragedy will rock the world of Norrath and
test the mettle of every adventurer. No matter your experience, young or
old, valorous or villainous, it will be up to you to help turn back a
coming tide of darkness that could change the world irrevocably!

Dateline Freeport: Like the ripples from a stone dropped in a glassy
sea, an unhallowed call-to-arms spreads throughout Norrath from the
newly risen Dorian Dulein, pirate captain of the Rotting Revenge who was
slain in the naval battle with the White Maelstrom. In answer, the bones
of dead sailors claw their way back to undead life and besiege the city
of Freeport, their single-minded goal: Obey Dulein's irresistible
summons�

Dateline Oasis: The echoing call of Dulein crosses oceans of sea and
sand alike, penetrating The Oasis, where it reaches the long-dead and
dried ears of the sinister Captain Blackhand. Forced into undeath by
Dulein's call, it is only through Blackhand's insurmountable will and
boundless greed that he and his loyal sailors are able to resist
Dulein's command and seek out their most prized treasure, buried long
ago somewhere in the Oasis�

Dateline Emerald Jungle: Scenting chaos in the air, the followers of the
mighty Iksar general, Venril, rally in the depths of the Emerald Jungle
with plans of their own�

Stranded by his own evil arts on a small island after his defeat and
death, Dulein calls his new home the Marauder's Mire, where he now rules
as a tortured god. However, a brash young pirate seeking the legendary
plunder of the lost island has recently disturbed Dulein's solitude. His
anger has opened a permanent gateway to his Mire and unleashed a summons
throughout the world so powerful that wherever a pirate has died in
Norrath, their spirit would again find their corpse and rise to join
Dulein in his new home, razing all that lay in their path. 

These server-wide events, plus many more, will culminate in the opening
of a brand new zone unique to the Legends Server. Called the Marauder's
Mire, this new land will challenge players of all levels, but they must
first discover its location before they may begin seeking the untold
pirate's treasures hidden there!

The Legends events begin February 22, 2002. Get the full story from
"Marauders of the Sea: A New History of Piracy in Norrath" and visit the
Legends Service homepage to make your mark on EverQuest!

Lost Quests - The Blued Steel Hammer

The "Blued Steel Hammer" is a weapon of legendary repute, but whose
existence has been relegated to myth. Most people believe it is no
longer in the game.

Those people are wrong!

The "Blued Steel Hammer" was the reward for a very old and notorious
quest that could not be completed for a while. Most players have
forgotten about the hammer�

However, the Blued Steel Hammer is out there. It is one of several items
that no one has yet discovered. Or "rediscovered," in this case.

"I implemented the Blued Steel Hammer quest a long time ago, before last
E3, but no one has discovered it yet," says Jeremy Ellis, designer on
EverQuest. "'Old school' players should recognize the name of the item
and the quest it starts with, known as the 'Priestess of Najena' quest."

So, start questing!
