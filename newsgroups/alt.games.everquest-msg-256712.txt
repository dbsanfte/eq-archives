At higher levels the hit is worse, so you do need to worry about it.
And though your weight limit also goes up, it's not by much.  My monk
looks hard at the weight of any piece of gear I'm thinking of wearing.
Over time, I've managed to adjust my gear to put my at only 14 pounds
prior to picking up any loot.

Weight-reducing bags are your friend, but they're not a lot of use to
a monk unless the WR is pretty high, and those bags get expensive.
(E.g., a Rallic Pack, holds 10 giant items with 85% weight reduction,
typically goes for 700-850pp in the bazaar on my server, and it's Lore
so you can't have more than one.  Leatherfoot Haversacks, 10 giant with
100% WR, go for around 5000-6000.)

What my monk did was to get into tradeskills, pushing brewing to the
grandmaster level, which is actually fairly cheap to do.  Then I scraped
together most of my plat for the components for the Grandmaster Trophy,
which besides having a lot of nice stats also lets me summon no-rent
bags that are 100% WR.  (You can also convert one of those into a
permanent 100% WR bag.)  So now when I'm looting I only have to worry
about the weight of the coins.  If I'm in a group, I can usually get
someone to cash me out, giving me plat in return for an equal value of
smaller coins.

For soloing, I carry a stack of Bat Wings (water flasks would also do,
but tend to get drunk up).  With sufficient charisma (104 if indiff)
those sell for 2gp per stack, and then you can buy them back for the
same 2gp.  (Make sure the NPC merchant has an empty slot before you
sell, though.)  When you sell you get paid in gold, but when you buy
you spend copper and silver first, so this is a way to convert copper
and silver into gold at most NPC merchants.  (Some people just destroy
the copper and silver, but hey, it wasn't easy scraping up the money
for the GM Brewing Trophy and whatnot, and at low levels even a few
dozen gold can be a lot of money.)

If you can afford them, the Leatherfoot Haversacks are better than
the summoned bags, because (a) you don't risk losing them -- with all
their contents -- if you get disconnected for half an hour, and (b)
the haversacks themselves weigh about half a pound less than the
summoned bags.  Once I could afford them, I bought two.
