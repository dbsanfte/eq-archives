Imo evacing would be the worst thing to do on a raid..

The vast majority of higher end raids involve a substansial amount of
clearing to get to (often many, many hours)..  in case of a wipe, your
corpse there means (assuming successful cr) you can resume right where you
left off.  Gate out though, and you have to run back, halt the raid while
they CoH you (assuming its a CoHable zone..).. and your gating also reduces
the chances of a successful CR.

You dieing = a cleric not dieing..  (well the mob can only kill 1 person at
a time).. if you don't get a rezzer safely out, you could have just wasted
over 6 hours for nothing.
