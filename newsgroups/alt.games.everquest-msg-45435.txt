I'm thinking of maxing mine out. I currently have been lazy and only
have 128 in my primary machine. But even with that, on a cable modem, I
zone really quickly. In fact, similar to the situation you describe
above, I've used zone lines to break up multiple spawns the same way
Monks use FD to single pull. I've pulled three mobs to a zone line,
zoned out and immediately back in, and run back to pick off the last to
wander back from the zone.
