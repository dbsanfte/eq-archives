My magician spent a week straight hunting Sol A, in the process letting
several runed lava pendants and other lore rare drops rot, and still doesn't
have power of fire.  Jeez, 5 hours?  Give up on the epic now, because if you
start thinking things are broken after only 5 hours the rest of the quest is
_definitely_ out of your reach.

buyable.
