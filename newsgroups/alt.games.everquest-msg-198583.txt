I'm having a problem that just started today for no apparent reason.  I'd
like to run it by everyone to see if maybe someone is having a similar
problem.  I logged onto The Seventh Hammer server this morning and played
with my main for approximately 2 hours.  Everything was fine.  I logged off
and an hour later I logged back on and now I can barely stay on for a minute
before my computer freezes up.  I tried about three times to log in and
play, but it froze up every time.  I decided to try out another character on
the same server...froze up again.  So I decided to try another server with
another character...it worked fine for at least 5 minutes, so I figured that
maybe it was the server.  So tonight I went to another server to try and
start a new character...it froze me up before I could even select what class
I wanted.  So out of my last 10 attempts to get on and play, my computer has
froze on about 8 of them.  It doesn't seem to be any certain server or
character.  And it doesn't seem to be the last patch since I played for
several hours after the last patch and all was well.  Any advice would be
appreciated.

Gordon
