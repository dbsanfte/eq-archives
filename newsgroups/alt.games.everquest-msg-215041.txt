The account or atleast the characters on it are of no use to me. I
would like to transfer one of my characters from my main account to
the newly aquiered account. I updated all the expansions on both
accounts. Did my app on EQ's website and a few days later got a reply
from Customer service telling em that it can't be done. The reason is
that I was not the original owner of the new account. I sent them a
reply informing them that it was my friends and I had all the
information they needed. even my friend said he would e-mail them and
give thme any information needed to make this happen but still
couldn't get it done.

Did you change all the billing information on your friends account to
yours?

Try that and ask again.  Of course it may already be to late.
