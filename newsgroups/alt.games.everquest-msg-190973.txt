blacksmithing is probably the tradeskill with the most opportunity
for profit.  it's also one of the most difficult to get your skill
up to the level where you can actually make money.

if your purpose is to make a profit, you might want to think twice.
maxing your skill is gonna cost you a TON of plat, not to mention
untold hundreds of hours collecting components.  you might easily
never recoup your costs, let alone make any actual profit.

if you're in it for fun or ropleplaying, though, then go for it.
the occasional bout of tradeskilling makes for a nice change
from the experience grind.
