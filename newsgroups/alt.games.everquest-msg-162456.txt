You'd be amazed how many people know you by reputation that you don't
even remember. One of my fellows rogues-in-guild I hadn't talked to in
months sent me a tell months after I'd heard from him last. Only, the
tell came from somebody called "Thryl." The guy I knew was called
"Prik." I'm not someone it would have occurred to him to send a direct
tell regarding the name change nor vice versa if my name changed.

Even a year and a half later, there are people who know me as Qiin, my
retired necro and not as Moulin, my active main. Earlier this week, I
saw someone I was guilded with and friendly with as Qiin LFG and had
to explain who I was to them. This is nearly 2 years since I've
actively done anything with this person, but she still remembered me.
