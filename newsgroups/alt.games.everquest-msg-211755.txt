The heart is a great buy if it can be bought for 20K or less on your
server.  Also look for items with focus effects that save mana or give
spells more punch (Burning Affliction is great).  Once you have these
get focus items for range and spell haste, they are important too. 
You can do without the mount for now I suspect.

Oh, and SOW potions will save your life again and again and again and
again - get some.
