A number of times I've heard people talking about being in a group
where they get overwhelmed by a bad pull or something and they'll talk
about how "so and so got killed, then I told the cleric to camp".
What exactly does this mean?  Does the cleric go and cast Divine
Aura/Divine Barrier and then actually /camp near wherever the group is
fighting like the cleric is quitting for the night?  If so, am I
correct in guessing that the cleric does that so he/she can then log
in again right after and will be near all the group's corpses so
he/she can rez them easily?

Also, a real dumb question, but who generally makes the call for a
group to run/gate out/evac/camp and what's the general rule of thumb
about when they should do this? 

Thanks in advance,
