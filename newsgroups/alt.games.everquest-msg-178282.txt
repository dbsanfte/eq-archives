This is neither the time nor the place for such sentiments.  I, too, 
have had fantasies about "how I'd like to go", but my first thought when 
watching the news was NOT "ooh, lucky them", and I doubt their families 
or friends would appreciate such sentiments.

I'm actually worried about how they died - the news said 
'disintegrated', not 'blew up'.  If they died how I think that means 
they died, I'm horrified at how painful it might have been.
