Basically Im upgrading, time for the amd 450 to retire,  and the cheapest
PC's in the UK I can find come with onboard sound/graphics (cheaper than
build your own, well a company that does it for you). I only really use PC
to play EQ so if I have onboard problems that can be disabled then thats all
good. Thanks :)
