Not certain on the feesability at lvl 38/9 but one of my favourite
places for farming a bit of pp is Giant Fort in FM.  They dont drop
much by way of pp, however the loots are decent pp at the merchants. 
Weapons, belts & hats go for 15ppish, tunics about 60pp & earrings
(which are somewhat rarer) about 260pp.

Unlike some of the other farming spots this place is generally pretty
empty (on Povar at least) & the repop rate of the mobs is very fast. 
The giants dont have too much HP, most are 1300 - 1500.  Theres the
odd ones that are rather more (2500ish).  I tend to just wander around
getting agro & let an animation pet do all the killing.  All are v
green to me & dont hit very hard so AR absorbs all that.  I tend to
pop there when I've a short time available to restock some pp for
food/drink or dots.  I can generally do about 500pp in a 20 - 30 min
session.

The other ususal places like HG's in Rathe Mountains are always
heavilly camped.
