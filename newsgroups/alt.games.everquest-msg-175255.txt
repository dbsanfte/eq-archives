The PoP groups I have been in have had no problems with someone doing ML
duty, I have done it at times, they have all done NBG, when a Cleric/Shaman
item dropped, just me and the cleric rolled on it (droppable), when a
spectral parchment dropped, just casters, when a tradeskill item dropped,
just people doing the tradeskill.  It's been extremely refreshing.  I have
had only one bad pickup group, and it had nothing to do with loot.
