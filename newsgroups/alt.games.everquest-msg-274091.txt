If you pay to come to my house and one of the rules is no 
violence, and you violate it, you are SO out of my house.

Think of it as you argue that whereas punching is violence, and 
will get you thrown out of the house, slapping is OK because you 
*always* see sports stars slapping each other on the ass in 
congratulations, and slapping a high five as a celebration, so 
OBVIOUSLY slapping someones face is not violence but a form of 
congratulations....

pussy is a cat, cats are cute and fluffy, and had previously [a 
hundred years ago] been used as a term of endearment, so despite 
the common everyday usage of pussy as a derogetory term is so out 
in left field you *shouldnt* get in trouble for contravening the 
filters by calling the guy a pu55y....
