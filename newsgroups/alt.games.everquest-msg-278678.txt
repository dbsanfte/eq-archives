Well, the absolute best xp group that I know of over time is an AoE 
group.  The best xp group I have personally ever been in was all level 65 
(pre OOW), Paladin, 4 DPS, Shaman.  The four DPS shifted between rogues, 
monks, rangers over time, with the Paladin and I remaining for the entire 
time.  Both those groups are, however, situational, certainly.  You 
honestly do not need a cleric as the healer to keep the pulls going 
nonstop, you also do not need the tank to be a warrior, a shadowknight or 
paladin will work just as well for xp situations.  The only time you 
really need the enchanter is when you get a serious overpull, most times 
a bard is actually better, as he can hugely increase the DPS of the group 
while he is not too busy doing CC.

I can honestly say that I have never bothered with making sure I have the 
holy trinity in any xp group I have been in.  I have xped in a wide 
variety of zones at low and high levels, more often than not with a 
knight class as the tank, swapping in a druid or cleric interchangably, 
and at times making do with just me as the healer and slower.  This 
includes doing things like Tipt, where most people will say that a shaman 
is superflous, and you must have a cleric and a warrior to do it.  The 
first time I did Tipt, and succeeded by the way, was with a Paladin tank,  
a cleric, me, a ranger, a necro, and a rogue.

Seriously, for fast/safe xp, you go to safe spots where you really don't 
need the holy trinity anyway.  Prior to OOW, fire was the spot to go for 
xp, anyone but a total idiot can single pull there, with, worst case, 
getting one add.  The mobs you are fighting there for the best xp are 
rootable, so crowd control is trivial with several rooters available.

With OOW, RSS is probably about the best xp spot available (maybe anguish 
is better, no clue, will be a long time until I see it, if ever).  For 
RSS, things are a bit more tricky, and something close to the holy 
trinity is pretty close to a must, although you certainly can get by 
without it, if you don't mind living a bit dangerously.

With DoN, suddenly it became easy again.  Bards are actually more 
desirable than enchanters usually then, as they can pull, as well as 
crowd control, and significantly increase DPS.  Druids and clerics are 
interchangable as the main healer, and any tank class works just fine.
