You don't even have to go linkdead.  You can let yourself get kicked off 
the corpse, and it will not poof.

I just had this happen to me the other night.  In fact, I was actively 
thinking "leave the lock picks on the corpse" but what did I do?  Yeap, I 
right clicked them.  Last item removed.

I was panicking.  Cleric was running to rez me while I held on for dear 
life.

Only she was too late.  It kicked me off.  And my corpse was still there.  
Completely empty, still with almost the full 3 hours to rez it.
