    I think these issues get left a long time because VI first doesn't
believe the issue (they STILL think the mob attacking after Feigning is due
to latency), then once they find the issue it turns out to be imbedded in
the game mechanics. Feign and Mend being wonky is related to buffs dropping
without messages or flashing, something I've noticed has cropped up again
recently.

    As for neglect, well, you ARE the premiere pullers in the game. You at
least have a role - there are classes that still wish they had a role that
useful. And they did respond to monk complaints of all looking alike. ;-)

    IIRC Ester's main is a monk. Not that she has time to play, given all
the goofball projects they seem to give the bug team.... I'd say monks were
balanced, though. Your weaponry is designed to keep you close to the top of
the damage curve, and you function well in that regard in XP groups. In the
endgame you are the pullers, and pretty much only you except where goofy
faction games are being played to pull stuff. Against boss mobs you have a
greatly diminished role, but that's hardly a monk-specific issue. And in the
event a CR is required, you are usually an important part of the CR team.
Sounds like you're useful to me.
