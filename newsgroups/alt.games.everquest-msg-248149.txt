The graphics engine used by the client should not make a difference, but how
about the communications protocol?  The servers send some data that they
don't want players to know, and the servers are too trusting of data from
the client, and occasionally people take advantage of this, and then SOE
makes a change to the data stream format.

That would require an update on both Mac and PC at the same time if they
were using the same servers.

I believe they outsourced Mac porting to a Mac game company, and so there
might be logistical problems in doing simultaneous updates.
