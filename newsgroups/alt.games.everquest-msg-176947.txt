Hey now!  I run around cackling in glee that the mob can't get to me no 
matter how mad he is and how hard he tries.  No screaming involved.

Well, except in earlier levels, when fear and snare would break at the 
same time. ;p

Technically, it doesn't *require* sow.  I've done it without potions 
when I haven't made enough money in awhile.  It just requires more 
keyboard jockeying on your part - a bit of strafe running now and then 
to get far enough ahead to smack it with another dot.  What it does 
require, and what I always forget, is to turn off your pet's taunt. *g*  
Once I've done that, I prefer aggro kiting to fear kiting for the simple 
reason that it's much easier to control where the mob is running - ie 
not into a large party of his best friends.  Oh, and an extended range 
focus item (ie moonstone ring) helps too.

SHHHH!
