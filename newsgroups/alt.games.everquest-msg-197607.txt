At least some of them are shared.  Blizzard Blast for example is a shaman 
level 44 spell, BL level 59 spell, Spirit Strike is level 14 for shaman, 
level 30 for BL.  Adding the "for a hybrid" to the statement makes a big 
difference.  Rangers actually get a more efficient high end nuke than BLs.  
Ratio of 2.78:1 (ranger) vs 2.7:1 (BL).  SKs are only slightly behind at 
2.67:1, and Paladins are the lowest, and only VS undead, at 2.6:1.
