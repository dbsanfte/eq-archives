/agree

Episode II tanked. Look at the trends. The Box OFfice that #1 did vs the 
seqeul... I think that is *very telling* of where Lucas took the 
franchise. And no matter how high you start...a decline of 30% is a flop.

Further... two 'mega blockbuster' trilogies that came out more or less 
simultaneously...

SW Ep I grossed -     $925,600,000
SW Ep II grossed -    $648,200,000

LotR FotR grossed -   $867,683,093
LotR TTT grossed -    $922,986,073
LotR RotK grossed - $1,101,076,932

I'd say in the face of trends like that the Star Wars prequels are 
tanking. There is simply no *good* reason that EpI&II could not mirror 
or even exceed the performance of LotR.

Phantom, as the numbers show, did very well, but I beleive it was mostly 
on the strength of the franchise up until that point... the 2nd one 
suffered miserably trailing the underwhelming Phantom, and on its own 
lacklustre merits. The "Star Wars" name no longer carries its former 
strength.
