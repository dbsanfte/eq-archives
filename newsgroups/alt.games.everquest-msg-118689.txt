Seriously folks,   Do you REALLY belie this guys lame excuse that it
was a kid writing his posts?

Go take a look at his earlier posts and it is clear no 12 year old kid
wrote that stuff.   A mentally unstable adult, yeah.  But no 12 year
old.

This is just a lame excuse to duck out and give himself some sense of
victory or something.
