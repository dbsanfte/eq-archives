Well, starting at 16 you can say "anyone who casts AE damage spells don't
get breeze."  It's amazing how quickly people shape up at that point.

Until then, if those AE spells are aggroing the critters, don't worry about
saving him from himself.  Let him die.  After a couple of runs from his bind
point he'll probably get a clue.  The only person you have to be RELATIVELY
nice to is the healer. :)

BTW, INT items are easier to get than CHA items...putting those points in
CHA is probably a good idea but I bet your INT sucks unless you're twinking
at all, so you probably need to start working on that very soon.
