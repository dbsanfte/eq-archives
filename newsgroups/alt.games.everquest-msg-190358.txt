Some questions from relative newb:
1) I have reached lvl9 as ranger and have built my weapon skl mainly in 2hs
and neglected most others. Is it worth getting skilled in hand 2 hand etc.?
Can I build skill in these by bashing up greenies (not for exp just weapon
skill)?
2) Whats the point of wearing pearl earrings and other gems - is just to
look pretty?
3) How do i sharpen rusty swords? - i think i need a sharpening stone but
where do i get it from (I am based around Qeynos)
4) If I stash goods somewhere in the wilds do they stay there forever or do
they eventualy disappear?
