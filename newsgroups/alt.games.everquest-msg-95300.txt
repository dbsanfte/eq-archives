That isn't true. If you went into space with out a space suit you would have
to hold your breath untill you died. You would get a sun burn because there
is nothing blocking the rays of the sun and your blood would swell a little
bit. Not much, it is more of an uncomfort. I seen a tv show about that. So
this is true.
