I would concur.  There are now so many zones that people are very
spread out, and it's often hard getting a group/rez/port/etc.

There are still just as many people on, but they're more likely
to be 12 zones away now instead of right where you happen to be,
or in the zone next door, as used to be the case before the last
two expansions.
