That's the way I look at it, too.  When I port, I shout I'm porting "for donations".  If the person asks me how much, I repeat, "I port for
donations.  Give what YOU think is fair."  Sometimes, I get 9 or 10p.  Sometimes, I get 50p or more.  Thing is, if I insisted on getting 20p
per port, I would say I'm porting "for 20p", and I'd insist on getting it up front.

All in all, I've been stiffed twice in 47 levels, and my average donation is more than 20p per port, so I think it works out fine.
