Yes, people do cause riots over soccer, but doing so over a "game"
is just plain stupid no matter how you try to justify it.  Also
breaking the rules by using hands is a violation, but the other
players don't refuse to play with a person because he does this.
Also not every player on the feild call the penalties only the refs
do.  And Verants naming policy is anal.  All that being said this is
a long way from a real-life hands on situation.  It is a hack and
slash computer game that many take way to serious, you seem to fall
into that catagory.  Relax, enjoy the game and don't worry about
other peoples names.
