1. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

Exclude - We can get rid of this one, since it obviously applies only
to Judeo-Christians, and thus isn't representative of the entire
population of the US. Further, there are few if any laws derived from
this.


2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.

Exclude - Virtually no one has ever obeyed this in secular or
religious application, and as with #1, there are few if any laws
derived from it.


3. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain.

Exclude - Freedom of speech pretty much trumps this one where US law
is concerned.


4. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

Exclude - Whose sabbath? The one that falls on Sunday? Or Saturday? Or
the one that falls on full moons? I'll grant that a few places still
have laws regarding businesses operating on Sundays, but even those
places apply the law unevenly (they don't require that police, for
example, do not work on Sunday).


5. Honour thy father and thy mother.

Exclude - Most laws regarding parents and children speak to the
responsibilities of the parent. And, of course, you can't legislate
thought, which is what this one is all about.


6. Thou shalt not kill.

Keeper - Finally! We get to a commandment that has a practical
application for society. Of course, it's been a good idea since the
first time two humans lived within spear throwing distance of one
another, long before Moses came into the picture. It certainly
predates the commandments, and I'm quite sure our founding fathers
could have thought this up on their own.


7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.

Exclude - No clear definition of adultery. This one finds itself being
called upon to apply to every situation that someone finds personally
offensive, including premarital sex and homosexual relationships.
Frankly, if it's between two consenting adults, it isn't the business
of the government, even if the religious right wishes otherwise.


8. Thou shalt not steal.

Keeper - With pretty much the same commentary as applied to #6.


9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

Keeper - Too bad so many Christians have ignored this one. I wonder
how many innocent women would not have been killed as witches if their
neighbors hadn't borne false witness against them. Ah, the smoky
stench of hypocrisy and flaming pyres.


10. Thou shalt not covet any thing that is thy neighbour's.

Exclude - What's wrong with coveting? Stealing is wrong, but wanting
isn't. Frankly, if we didn't covet the things we see, the entire
capitalistic system our national economy is built on would collapse. 


So, we end up with three that actually are of any validity today. Not
a very good showing for the ten commandments, really, when you try to
justify displaying them on the basis of their historic relevance to
modern law.

And you know what? Wiccans can cover the same ground with just one
law... "An it harm none, do what you will".
