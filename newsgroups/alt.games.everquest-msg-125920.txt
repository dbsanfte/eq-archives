Not really, I have no problem saying it whatsoever. :)  And, it does seem 
to follow rather directly from omnipotence.  Otherwise you'd run into that 
stupid "yea, well, can He make a rock so big that He can't lift it" 
argument too easily.

By the way... how do you know I'm not omnipotent?

And for extra credit... how do you know -you- aren't?

And don't tell me you just take it on faith.  That'd be really boring. :)
