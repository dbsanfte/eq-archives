Where are you getting your research components?  They didn't cost me
near that much.  Most words for pre-50 research are 5 plat.  Check NPC
vendors near the zones that are just above your level as they will
sell for less than most bazaar vendors.  

The spell itslf should be in the bazaar for about 20-30 plat.  (If it
isn't, your future research, when that spell is trivial, will have a
nice place for you to make a profit.)
