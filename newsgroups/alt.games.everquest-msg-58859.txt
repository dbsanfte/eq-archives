Fear only works outdoors. Slowing stuff works everywhere. It is part of
what a shaman does to EVERY mob that is fought (this is assuming an xp/item
camp, and not some major raid mob). A druid snares stuff in similar
fashion. But snare doesn't cut down (much) on the need to heal. Slow does.

>Torpor eliminates clerics?  Are you nuts?

No. Torpor is ungodly powerful.

The slow is pretty minor, and it doesn't negate your haste like being
actually slowed does. The snare is TOTALLY unimportant...if you are
meleeing something, your movement rate doesn't matter in the least.

Torpor benefits from a long standing "bug" where it will (about half the
time) get an extra tick of healing in. That is 1500 points for 200 mana.
This bug effects all DoT and HoT spells.

I'm not trying to claim that torpor is more mana efficient than CHealing a
60 tank, but torpor honest and truely does eliminate the need for a cleric
in the group. The drawback of course is that it is obscenely rare.

That people are stupid doesn't change what they COULD be doing. Given the
option between shaman and druid for healing purposes, the druid loses every
time. Simple fact.
