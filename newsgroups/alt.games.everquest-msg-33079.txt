Starting the epic doesn't *require* you to be 46 or higher, its just that
some part of every epic is no drop off one of the planes, and so, in order
to get your epic, you MUST be plane-capable.

And besides, GB and Soulfire do NOT require planar travel, but are interim
rewards/pieces of the Paladin Epic, along with the Fiery Avenger, which is
planar required, along the way to the true Epic, Fiery Defender.

Oddly though, the final step in the SK epic requires you to kill Lhranc
(sp?) in CoM and loot the epic, so I kind of wonder if you could get
Innoruuk's Curse (SK epic) with a level 8 SK or something that you escort to
CoM and let loot Lhranc.  (Although it feels just as wrong as seeing a level
1 paladin with Soulfire, which I have seen)
