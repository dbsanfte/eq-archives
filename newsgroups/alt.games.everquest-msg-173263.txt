Did you read his post?  The second definition of "compare" is not there
by accident.  It is a common use of the word.  You chose a poor word
to make your argument with, but then since David did <not> equate the
two, but rather compared them in such a way as to highlight some of the
differences, JUST AS YOU DID YOURSELF FOR PETE'S SAKE, your argument
is in tatters before you've even begun.  Take a couple deep breaths
and then reread all of the relevant posts, starting with David's, that
might lead to you possessing an actual clue.
