If your told by the raid leader to get the fuck away from their raid, thats
exactly what you should do.

Not only is leaching faction deemed rude by some people, but your adding to
the lag (which is a big reason for wipes) and theres always the risk your
going to turn into a pos ninja (not 'YOU', but some people who do that).
You also don't see the guild chat, see instructions/positioning/when being
told to move/where to move to etc, it only takes 1 dumbass to wipe a raid

We did the 10th ring war a lil while back for a guildie rogue (after such
shitty luck with the first 2 attemps being bugged and mass spawning the
giants) only for some random 35 enchanter to loot the final fucking quest
piece.  That same night we killed Lodi, ranger in my group was holding the
corpse and didn't know you get kicked off it after a few minutes, as soon as
he did a random 60 cleric ninjad the shield (he stole a guildies AoN a while
back though, so it wasn't a great shock...) we've also had loot ninjad from
the Itraer Vius

So yes, if my guild didn't want you there and you refused to leave, you
would be petitioned.  If you wanna see/kill the mob then raid it with your
friendly guilds, or get yourself a better guild.

We have no problem with *our* friends joining us for raids/faction, but the
guild decides who is welcome on raids, not you.
