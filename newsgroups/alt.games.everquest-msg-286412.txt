This is often caused by custom UIs that are broken by a certain patch.
I had some old mules that I hadn't logged on for some time with funky
UIs that hadn't been patched for as long as a year and were obviously
hopelessly broken.

For some reason half a dozen patches ago it was changed from a red
warning message and kicking you back to the default UI to [sometimes]
outright crashing as you describe.

(Note: I still get the red warning message on log-in with the SARS
custom UI that I use but it's not currently fatal and I have no real
clue which window isn't working so no motivation to fix it.)

As you cannot log the character in to reset to the default UI the only
solution is to manually delete the .ini file for that character which
forces it to use the default UI once again next time you log in.
