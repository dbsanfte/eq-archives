This was never really true. VP was always rather easy once you had
people keyed for it, and you had more danger of losing your corpse on
a blown PoF run. It was just *annoying as fuck* and took bloody
forever.

Remember they are kunark dragons. 32k hp and thats that. Guilds
capable of doing Trakanon reliably had no trouble with most the
dragons in VP.

Also the loot was not particularly impressive for the time demand.
Almost no one went back to VP at *all* once velious was released, and
that hasn't been true of any other expansion.
