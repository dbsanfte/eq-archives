Another helpful hint, is to do like my rogue has had to do
since about 35, Let the true tank class beat the mob down
slightly so it's good and aggroed at him, then jump in the
fight.  I still move up the hate list, but if I jump in
immediately, I am gonna get the mob and have a hard time
losing its attention.
