Replying to my own message, must be something psychological there
somewhere!! Well folks, the following seems to work, but for the next 2
weeks it's CoH for me.

EverQuest: Mouse freezes after I log into EverQuest.

First you need to download and install TweakUI for XP from Microsoft.
After you download and install this run TweakUI from Start->Programs->
Powertoys for Windows XP->TweakUI. Go to General section then expand it
by clicking the " + " symbol. Select " Focus ", then Un-Check " Prevent
Application from Stealing Focus ". Click the " Apply " button at the
bottom right then the " Ok " button. Your mouse should never get stuck
in EverQuest again.
