As a programmer, I look forward to that magic day when I get to drop
Win95 from the products I work on.  The less systems I have to
support, the better.

However, EQ is different.  When my company stops supporting Win95, all
that means is that our current users have to update to 98/Me/NT/2k/XP
to run the *NEXT* version of the product.  Their existing copy doesn't
break.  With EQ, when they patched to require DX 8.1, they broke
existing Win95 customers.

Second, there is the issue of notice.  What about people who bought EQ
recently to run on Win95?  Shouldn't they get more than a week or two
before the system requirements change sufficiently to remove a
supported OS?  Hell, you can go to www.everquest.com *RIGHT* *NOW* and
order EQ packages that say they work with 95.
