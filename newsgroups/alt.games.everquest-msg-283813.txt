My wife asked me to help her figure out the efficiency of the various
healing spells available to her cleric (hp healed per mana, hp per sec,
etc.).  The math gets tricky when you factor in focus items, since some
spells are so fast they're not affected by spell haste, and duration
heals aren't affected by improved healing foci, etc.  (And of course,
Complete Heal doesn't benefit from any foci, I believe.)

So anyway, I was parsing some logs to make sure I understood how some
of the foci work (e.g., improved healing adds a random integer percentage
from 1% to the max for the focus), and comparing against the effects of
each spell as found on Lucy, and was puzzled by some of the numbers.
I went back and did some experiments removing all focus items to keep
things simpler, and found that indeed, most clerical direct-healing
spells heal 5% more than the spell description says.  The big surprise
was that I couldn't find any mention of such a bonus in a bit of web
searching.

I haven't checked my druid yet; is this 5% bonus unique to clerics,
and does it depend on level or anything?  And are there any similar
"secret" bonuses that I ought to know about?

	-- Don.

p.s.: The 5% healing bonus is clearly separate from the improved heal
focus.  The focus in fact adds its percentage based on the post-5%-bonus
amount.  E.g., Supernal Remedy says it heals 1450, but in fact it heals
1522, and the focus then adds 1-N % of 1522 to that.
