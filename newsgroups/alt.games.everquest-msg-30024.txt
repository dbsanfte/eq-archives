Acumen Mask, which you get from another quest either from the same NPC
that gave you the Staff of Temperate Flux quest, or perhaps from an
NPC next to that one, has right-click effect of Gaze.  Although this
line of spells is widely considered to be useless because of the
clipping plane, it turns out it does actually let you see some things
farther away.  Mobs are clipped closer in than the clipping-plane, and
with Gaze (or similar spells), you can see mobs farther away.  This
can be quite useful when hunting in wide open places, such as OT.

Acumen Mask also is a nice +INT mask, so you'd probably want it even
without the right-click effect.
