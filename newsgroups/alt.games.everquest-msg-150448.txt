If I were you, for dual boxing, I'd have stayed in OT until 44, there are
still plenty of blues there at that level and they drop a lot faster and hit
lot weaker than anything in DL.
I'd agree with jlmc about Kodiak Caves (again, only until 44/45) but I found
the Giants in GD hit too hard at that level to be good for dual boxing
war/dru. Can't speak for Dwarves and as I haven't spent much time in BW I
found dual boxing there to be risky, I suppose if you know the zone well it
would be much easier/safer.

At mid forties you should be able to do DL's although I'd probably choose
somewhere like DSP now, if I was doing it again.
