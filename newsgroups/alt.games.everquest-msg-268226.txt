Actually, I wouldn't mind clicking on logs and rocks if I was getting
paid for it. Paying click on them, on top of using my already limited
free time doesn't sound very appealing... At least to me. If you guys
like it, have fun :) In fact, I'm glad you people like it so much...
Go make some nice boxes and pants and I'll gladly buy them.

For me, EQ2 seems a more casual experience. Not something I feel the
urge to endlessly treadmill. That could have something to do with me
skipping the tradeskills... I know most of my guild members are online
a LOT more than I am, and still about the same adventuring level.
