Have you ever noticed how details on players (expecially with the
newer Luclin models) "pop" into existance or suddenly get more
detailed as you approach them from a distance?

I think it has something to do with mip-mapping and/or the way
textures are drawn over distances. Different texture resolutions are
used at different distances. So dropping the clipping plane will
reduce the number of mip-map levels and textures in use (thus reducing
lag), but not necessarily reduce the total number of objects that are
drawn.
