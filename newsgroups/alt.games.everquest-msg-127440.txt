I finish fights 90% of the time with full health and a leech of some kind
still going. I also cast my lich pact while the fight is still going on. So
I've only very rarely been at a sliver of both left. the lich line only
costs 5 mana- sometimes I'll start that spell before I even pull. I'll leave
lich on until I'm 60% or 80%, depending on how low my health gets when the
leech fades. Then I'll pull again, or politely wait for my group. When I'm
in a full group of steady action, Lich is always on.

Nope. Didn't bother. I went for max int and some STA or STR (don't remember
now). I do have a lot +HP and + mana  items though. When I hit the AA stuff,
I plan on going for Regen 1-3 before going for Run 1-3, but I think that's
the only time I've ever thought of such things.

If you are set on trying it this way, I suggest an Iksar for the innate
Regen.

But do remember- the lower your int, the less of a mana pool you can regen-
because it isn't as big as it could be.
