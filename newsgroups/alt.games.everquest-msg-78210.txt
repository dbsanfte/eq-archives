Hehe...was in EC the other day with my alt rogue and somebody
wanted to buy the Barbed Ringmail she was WEARING AT THE
TIME! I told him that I understand the general price was around 8 kpp,
but if he wanted to buy it off of my back, it'd cost him a flat 10 kpp.
He called me an idiot, said he only had 6 kpp, and he could find
someone selling for that.

For a lark, I auctioned early in the morning and sold mine for 9500...
then later got on and bought the same armor from a different
person by OUTBIDDING the idiot from the previous day...he was
offering 6500, and I offered 7 kpp...if that didn't rub it in enough,
I let him know about the sale yesterday and that I still had my same
armor and now an extra 2 kpp in the bank ;-)

Normally, I wouldn't have even remembered his name, but he
was really nasty with the name-calling and such when I wouldn't
sell him my own armor worn at the time for less than even the
going rate.  Did I mention he was a level 8 character yet?
:-)
