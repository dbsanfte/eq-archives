I've used it pretty heavily inside a single systems that run on n-tiers.
Between database, application and client tiers it works out well because you
can change any of the three tiers as long as they always put in/out the
correct xml doc.  In my case, I can have an application with html, wml, or
fat form clients.  Also, it's nice on the middle tier to swap out dumb
servers for j2ee or .net.  It doesn't make it trivial but once the coding is
done it's hot swapable.  Right now, the enterprise databases don't sport the
same sophistication in XML but when the dust settles and all of the biggies
support it at a stored procedure level the db should be transparent also,
just swap drivers and let it rip.

The main reason to do this instead of an INI is the parsing intelligence
built into the tools and supported on many platforms.  For EQ, I'm not sure
if it's worth it but maybe eventually they will support OS-X or Linux.  Of
course the biggie there would be the big fat client.  Building in ini
support would be trivial compared to writing EQ.exe.
