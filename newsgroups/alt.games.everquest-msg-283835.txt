	1200 - 35% for focus and specialization.  A reasonably buffed
necro can med back 100 per tick.  So it's more like 600 for 450 mana.
IMHO you can optimize your kill rate by pulling "too fast" and having
the necro feed the cleric between pulls or when the cleric goes OOM.


	Keep those soul orbs handy, too, and you can *heal* the cleric
when he gets aggro.  That really blows their  minds :-)
