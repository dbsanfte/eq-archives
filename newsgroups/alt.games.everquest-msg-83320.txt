I was thinking a little about these messages we set in our hotkeys to tell
the group something important about what we are currently doing in battle...

Aren't most of them absolutely unnecessary???

I think there are only a few needed ones, like:

Puller tells the group, 'Incoming an Uglymob!!!'
Cleric tells the group, 'Healing Puller, stay in range please.'
Chanter tells the group, 'Mesmerizing an Uglymob! Don't attack it please!'

Completely unnecessary ones:

Wizard tells the group, '** Nuking an Uglymob for up to 611 points of
damage!!! **'
Shaman tells the group, 'The an Uglymob has been slowed!'
Chanter tells the group, 'debuffing magic resistance for a an Uglymob'

I mean, can't we just assume they are doing their job at their own best
judgement??
Of course some things, like snare/fear has to be organized if done by
different people, but there are so many useless messages out there.

/D
