Greetings all,

I'm setting up a duo with another player who shares the curse
of being Australian and thus finding many zones, other than the
grind zones, nearly empty. We also want to be able to do some
dungeon work which means even more chance of being the only ones
in the zone (barring the occassional camper).

We've pretty much decided on monk/shaman which looks like a solid
combination. Both of them mature relatively late, the shaman more
so, but they've got a nice mix of abilities.

The one pressing lack is crowd control. The only hope is clever
pulling by the monk and a bit of root parking. Is this enough for
a duo to survive, and gain xp, in many/any dungeons? Clearly we'd
want to have a solid level advantage on the creatures, with the
bulk being blue, light blue and green, but which dungeons should
we just give up on unless we're lucky enough to find an enchanter
hanging about?

The other problem is runners, which is going to be a serious pain.
In theory I have some chance to use root when they're low health
so the monk can get them to crawl mode before it breaks. Alternatively
I can dot them when they're low health and trust that to move them to
crawl mode or kill them before they return with friends. The dot
option is more attractive since it is a side effect of damaging the
foe, but are these strategies viable? At the moment my DOT is too weak
for me to really tell.

Another options is to delete my barbarian and re-start as a troll
capable of getting the regent symbol of innoruk. I don't want to
delete my barb, nor do I want to play a troll and re-do all the
faction work we did for the iksar monk, but the ability to cast
even a weak snare just looks immensely useful. As far as I know
this is the only runner control option a shaman or monk can get
(that's not on charges, this spell is going to be cast a lot) in
the entirety of EQ. Is it as good as it sounds? worth starting
over?
