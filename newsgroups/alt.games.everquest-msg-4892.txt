You needn't worry about patching. The system automatically patches for
you when you start the game up. This happens every time there is a new
patch. Typically this is every other week or so, but lately it's been
about twice a day - at least it feels like it.

Oh, and don't worry that you'll have to sit through *all* the
historical patches the first time - you wont. You'll just get the
current set of files. It will still probably be a sizeable chunk the
first time, of course.

There is no way to determine this in advance. I've played characters
on several different servers, and have found them to all have more or
less the same 'personality', for lack of a better word. 

Verant recommends that you start on a server with the lowest number of
people playing (you'll see how many are on each server after you log
on), but in my experience even the most crowded servers don't feel
crowded - this world is huge, and there's plenty for everyone.

An exception to the above paragraph is if you want to play in a player
vs. player environment. Several of the servers support this kind of
play, with varying rules. I've never played on any of them, so I can't
offer any insight - I'm sure someone else can pipe up and fill you in
with those details.

Welcome, and enjoy!
