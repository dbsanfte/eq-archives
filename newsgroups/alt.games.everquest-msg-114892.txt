When I moved past the tentacles, I pulled a spider for my pet to chew
on...and two wandering spiders and a crawler aggro'd on to him.  I must give
my pet credit though...he killed two of the spiders and the crawler (all
dark blue) before he bit the dust and I had to Gate.  The next time I tried
the spiders, that damn webmaster came in and spoiled the fun.
