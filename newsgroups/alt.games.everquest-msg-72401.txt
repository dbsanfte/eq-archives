hehe yep Cobalt scar is like that,  fortunately they are on very fast spawn
timers, and if you are on +dragon faction you can happly pull 4 of the 5
wyverns around the idol back to SS that 90% of the quad kiters seem to leave
:)  /boggle

Anyway to answer your question... There are many places to quad kite
throughout alll levels.  And quad kiting pre 51 reaps the highest exp
benefits (at very low levels we are talking more than 3 blue bubbles per
quad, diminishing down to 1.5 blue bubbles per quad at level 49)

Quad kiting:

16 - 20: Betetles in North Karana
20 - 24: i didnt actually quad kite for those 4 levels, just soloed single
yellow/red cons Sarnakc and the like in Lake of ill omen.
24 - 30 Quad kiting Goblins in Loio
30 - 36 Snowfang Gnolls in Iceclad ocean
36 - 44 Walruses/Ulthorks in Easter Wastes
44 - 51 Spirocs in Timorous Deep

As i said there are many more places this can be done.  The overthere is a
prime example of a nice quad kiting zone.  But these are the mobs i quadded
on.  Hope this helps answer your quesion :-)
