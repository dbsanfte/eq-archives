We had an FCFS race for the statue 2 or so weeks ago, both guilds assembled
at the same time/very similar forces.  To both of our guilds, pulling Vindi
is deemed "a guard" in the way of Statue.. not "a named" mob for one to
kill, while the other takes statue

Anyway we agreed upon whoever got Vindi first would get the shot on Statue
(if they had pulled Vindi, no way would I have jacked Statue from them)

Well we pulled Vindi (I had him inc 14 seconds after the guilds struck a
deal, so the other raid leader informed me).. but apparantly we "fucked them
over" by doing this.   Sure the timing wasn't so great, but I'd spent the
last 10 mins trying to talk to them (being passed from person to person and
having to wait while their leader moved various chars to kael)

Ironically we were the disrespectful party who had ruined guild relations
(even tho it was *ME* who made all the effort in striking a deal and would
play no part in jacking their mob)

Net result, various threats by them, we kill Statue (its pretty much a
guaranteed win for both guilds)

Anyway 2 mins later (before loot is even called) their gimp fucking monk
runs the Idol through our camp.   Obviously we wipe in seconds, we couldn't
even keep anybody on the Statues corpse (keeping it locked to prevent
ninjas)

We move the Idol, start rezzing..  some 30's POS warrior then comes running
through the camp with Idol in tow.

<3 EQ drama

A week later, same guilds.. same situation.  Again we pull first (not me
pulling this time) we have statue inc, their monks come and gank him.   A
blatant KS, like pouring petrol onto an already angry fire.. and
(remembering were the no honour, no morals guild in their eyes from the week
before) what a surprise, they didn't have Idol trained all through their
camp.

Bunch of fucks.
