The people that turn their noses up at the mention of martinis have
likely just never had a truly proper one. They also tend to be younger
and think of them as something "that dad or grandad drank". And yes,
there's the whole stereotypical black and white image of Darren Stevens
on Bewitched having one when coming home from work.

Sadly, making martinis is a rather lost art. It's far more than a drink.
It's like a whole interactive experience. :-)

First, there's all the hardware. I've gone through a number of different
sets of martini glasses in our collection over the years, before finally
settling on our current ones. (Lovely crystal with carnival glass stems
shaped like African tribal totems in blue and green with a nice wide
base.) Martinis are a very visual experience and a good glass really
adds to it. :-)

Then there's the mixing apparatus. I have a few styles of tall, thin
martini pitchers with their long glass stirring rods for any visitor who
prefers them stirred, but personally I'm firmly in the James Bond camp
when it comes to the Great Eternal Martini Debate.

My favorite shaker is a relic from the sixties. Plain, unadorned metal
with the snap on straining lid and self contained measuring cup. And the
measuring cup is important! Too many people watched too many M*A*S*H
reruns and decided that every martini should be "as dry as the desert at
noon", and vermouth should only be "shown" to the drink so the vapors
waft in.

Hogwash. If that's what you want then you're basically drinking a glass
of gin. Go pour some in a jelly jar and get over yourself. The vermouth
is in there for a reason, and I like what it adds to the flavor. The
"proper" mixture can vary from person to person, but I say six parts gin
to one part vermouth. Some old schoolers go with five to one, and good
for them.

And the quality of the ingredients is, of course, essential. If you're
going to get gin that comes in a  plastic jug for five bucks, you may as
well just go squeeze some aftershave through bread and drink that.
Bombay Sapphire is a really great gin at a not outlandish price. For
those on even more of a budget, shockingly Seagrams makes a pretty fair
one in a very decent price range. Vermouth may only come from one
distiller for all I know. ;-).

Then there's the olives. You can't just cheap out and get the little
tiny olives, or just stick one in there. What's the point? I see a
martini more like a little picnic. :-).  I'll generally load up four of
the really BIG spanish olives (like you use for salads) on the miniature
sword drink stickers.

Then, of course, there's the whole assembly process. Measuring the gin
and vermouth in proper portions into the container, adding a few ice
cubes, sealing and shaking thoroughly. The feel of the shaker against
your skin as it goes from room temperature to shockingly ice cold in
about two seconds. Then pouring it into the glass through the strainer.
The process of shaking it with ice turns the liquid opaque with tiny
bubbles, but then turns crystal clear. If you've measured it just right
there's just enough room to drop the olives in and it comes up to the
rim of the glass, with little air bubbles adhering to the olives.

Of course, now you basically have a glass of straight booze on your
hands, so it's not a drink you can sit and slam down all through a card
game like beers. But when the mood strikes you to make one, it can be a
real treat.

"Alcohol for the taste impaired...."  blah. I weep for today's youth.
Great traditions are dying left and right.

I never order them in bars because the young punks schlepping drinks
today haven't a clue. They may, if you're lucky, know the "recipie" for
a martini and can mechanically assemble one, but there's no artistry to
it.

/sigh
