    Straight answer.

    Have you also seen how often Primal drops in the post-awakening
Sleeper's? Have you seen specifically what pieces drop most frequently in
the post-awakening Sleeper's (hint: no dual wielding for j00)? Have you read
the post by Emil Sinclair, a monk in BotS (the guild that first woke the
Sleeper), on noows a while ago detailing how the overall drop rate of Primal
is really, truly LOWER after awakening? Have you given consideration to how
much time is wasted by a guild going there to knock off just the golems
repeatedly, as opposed to going for one big raid on golems and however many
Warders you're killing?

    Whoops, I used question marks. I guess I wished you'd asked these
questions FIRST.

    The issue is that once the Sleeper is gone, you can't experience the
coolest parts of the zone. You don't see the Sleeper trapped in his bubble.
You can't get the good loot drops. And because of what you need to destroy
to GET a key, it's unlikely that your guild will bother to make keys. You
have to turn in one of these:

instead of trying to force conclusions on him that he might not make!

    I can answer it here. The number one reason: you pissed me off. Every
little barb about "oh, you must have a crummy rep" made me want to shove
those words right down your green troll throat. By joining the co-leading
guild on my server, and by having my application be supported the most by
the WARRIORS of Lotus Cult who knew me from before, I'd say I've done that.
I also have a bunch of friends in the guild (obviously), and they're a large
enough guild that if I don't want to, say, kill Dain and ruin faction in
Thurg I can skip the raid and not be missed terribly.

    What's the challenge, again? Killing all four Warders? Oh, you can do
that WITHOUT waking the Sleeper by always leaving one Warder unkilled? Or do
you think the challenge was starting a script that kills you all with a
transparent dragon model that you can see (albeit not transparent) with a
quick trip to Western Wastes?

    The TRUE challenge in Sleeper's Tomb was to see if you could organize
your server enough such that four fairly high-end (Ventani was the only true
"ubermob" there) encounters could be done by anyone willing to rise to the
occasion and make the necessary sacrifices. Most servers failed that
challenge, and are the poorer for it.

    Hmm. So you've killed every mob in the zone that has to be killed to
wake the Sleeper at one point or another, but you haven't "really" beaten
the zone? Some guilds like LoS had it so easy there that they'd pile all
three Warder corpses (the easy Warders, not Ventani) in one screenshot.
Three Warders dead in under 30 minutes - but yeah, they hadn't "beaten" the
zone. <snicker>

    You want to talk about accomplishment? Imagine if Ventani had been left
alive on various servers, and guilds started killing him without the lame
archery tactic that Fires of Heaven spoon-fed them. THAT would be an
accomplishment - developing your own tactic to kill one tough encounter. Bet
the guilds that released the Sleeper would have been pretty proud of doing
that. But they'll never know.

    Originally, it was there. The top two guilds had a rotation agreement on
the Warders, and were prepared to alter it to accomodate attempts on
Ventani. Then one of those two guilds became capable of forcing a NToV
rotation. Out of spite, the other guild released the Sleeper using the exact
tactic from FoH. They did it out of spite, not any great desire to be
steamrolled by a translucent dragon.

    So who does get to decide if an action is immoral, if not the
individual? Shall I phone the fucking Pope and ask him? I've told you why I
think it was wrong - if you don't agree, fine. But to say "ur pompous for
thinking how you do" is just as "arrogant".

    Status in yourselves? WTF does that even mean? "Hey, Oobar, I think
you're an even BETTER warrior for using that bow the way you did yesterday!"
"Thanks, Oobar!" There's pride in killing the exact same shit you've been
killing for weeks, but instead of leaving up one mob you could kill with
your alts you clear them all? There's pride in copycatting a strategy from
the 'Net and using that to finally kill the one mob you couldn't kill
before? Show me the accomplishment, because I'm missing something here. YOUR
guild has accomplishment, Jazz, every time you kill a new mob by figuring it
out yourself. Every time you refine that fight from "sloppy piece of crap"
to "flawless victory", using ideas and concepts YOU came up with. I'm
surprised you could write that line above.

    The 5% fallacy is the silliest arguement the releasers ever use. Look at
the people on Stormhammer. A guild of over 100 people, formed overnight from
dribs and drabs from other servers (with a core from one server, not the
guild that released the Sleeper on that server), capable of releasing the
Sleeper. Killing Zlandicar for keys isn't hard - he's farmed by mid-tier
guilds on my server for cash from selling the Heart. Killing many of the
mobs inside Sleeper's isn't hard. Given time (and we ain't talking decades
here), you're going to have a hell of a lot more than 5% of your server
population capable of seeing Sleeper's given the key.

    It was the number one factor on my server. Numero uno. On many of the
other servers that woke him, it was the primary reason to do it. The guild
on Stormhammer gave THEIR reason why they wanted to do it, and it wasn't
"for the experience of a lifetime!" They wanted to shaft everyone else so
they could maintain a competitive advantage on getting the top spawns (not
like a lynch mob of 100 people needs a competitive advantage - they can lag
the mobs out and win). To use your terms, stop being so fucking innocent
about this.

    There's competition, and there's stupidity. It's like the old airline
wars we used to have here in Canada between Air Canada and Canadian Airlines
(yes, two airlines at one point!) They slashed rates on the routes they both
covered to the point that Canadian went bankrupt from it and Air Canada is
in constant danger of going under or being forced to sell out to someone
else. They competed past the point at which it turns from competition to
blood feud.

    Guilds waking the Sleeper are doing the same. They're taking content
that they themselves could be using (get enough new recruits, equip them
with one Sleeper's run even for guilds past the zone) and destroying it just
to prevent others from using it.

    I've said it countless times, I'll repeat it again until you understand.
The challenge to waking the Sleeper is killing all four Warders. IF you are
capable of killing any three Warders you wish to kill at any point in time,
including Ventani, then WHY wouldn't you think the exact same thing? Do you
require Kerafyrm stomping you into a paste to confirm that "yeah, we CAN
kill all four Warders"? Are the guilds that couldn't kill Ventani without a
copycat strat particularily proud that THEY never figured out how to off him
on their own?

    Whee, a dragon model that already exists in game killed me quickly. If
I'm bound in Skyshrine, I can see it happen again. Colour me unimpressed. I
knew when my server's awakeners were doing it, and didn't consider it worth
my while to go to Skyshrine and see the Sleeper rampage over everything.
That should tell you what I thought of that event.

    Exploring content? Everyone who did this KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN, modulo
a bugged script. They knew what Kerafyrm would do to them, they knew what
other zones would have dragons shouting stuff, they knew exactly where the
big guy would go and kill stuff. They knew this because other true
trailblazing guilds had done it first and posted all the results. Do you
really think the motivation for JoeBob Ranger was so he could see Vox shout
on his mule parked in Perma?

    No, the actual key phrase is "once that limited number gets too big".
Things like the Ragefire list on Morel Thule would be considered insane on
my server, because clerics on that list may not be members of guilds that
require clicker clerics. So we have no rotation on Ragefire - there's so
many people capable of killing him that the top guilds wouldn't agree to
waiting months to get an epic for a_cleric_recruit08. And we don't kill it
just 'cause - last Ragefire to be killed was for a cleric not in my guild,
and it was killed with help from a full group of folks in my guild.

> Hrmmm.... interesting. So in your case, you have a

    Specifically, with the one other guild capable of doing the things we
have rotations on. If one or two other guilds proved themselves capable,
they'd be added to the rotations. Any larger, and it just goes FFA because
nobody wants to be bothered keeping track of stuff that takes a month to
come around. Blame weeklong spawn times for that.

    No (sigh), when the rotation grows too cumbersome for its own good then
it goes. Nobody's going to wait a month to kill the one mob they want to
kill when they have the time. And with weeklong respawn times and enough
guilds in a rotation that's what you get. For example, we have two guilds in
rotation on NToV, with a third alliance just trying it out now. If the third
is successful (and I bet they will be), then the rotation will be expanded
to the three. Once you start talking about adding a fourth guild, though,
you start having monthlong waits to be able to do things. That's usually
when the parties already in the rotation agree it's easier to just let it go
FFA (or, more properly on my server, FCFS - first come, first serve,
respecting raids already in progress).

    They should, if they ever want to see it. Having early rotations means
no blown spawns, and gets the people who could outcompete them into the dust
finished with things fastest. If you can think of a better way, by all means
share - we don't want fighting on our server, by and large, because we've
seen exactly how destructive we can be when we put our minds to it.
(Quellious is a soap opera server that way.)

    If they want to set up a small rotation, they're welcome to it. But
setting up lengthy rotations usually ends up being more trouble than it's
worth. That's the key. Imagine a rotation on Hate today, say, with all the
people that could clear the plane. Guilds would complain about their alloted
time, would complain about people ignoring the rotation (if a lot of people
can do something, it's inevitable at least one of them will be a jerk),
would complain if things weren't cleared completely by the last guild or not
cleared fast enough, etc. Not worth the hassle.

    Taking a weeklong spawn = eliminating a spawn entirely? Interesting

    Please do - I allow archiving! :-) Like I said above, I'm in a guild
with friends that's flexible enough (due to size) that I'm not going to be
called to every last event that the guild plans. For the AoW we had 13
clerics - I didn't even realize prior to that we HAD 13 clerics, as I'd
never seen more than six or seven at a raid. They just were always different
clerics. I think you'll see when you look back that my biggest objection to
being guilded was having my time frittered away by morons. I don't think
it'll happen here.
