They should probably realize that gear isn't the reason they are getting
passed on for groups (unless they are *exceptionally* poorly equipped).

I'm a nice guy.  If I turn on LFG, I'll generally take any group that's
offered.  Hell, I get a kick out of the trainwreck of a truly bad group.

But I can tell you that if I get invited by someone wearing one of half a
dozen guild tags, I'll be able to tell you what half a dozen possible guild
tags every other member of that group will be wearing.  It has *nothing* to
do with equipment and everything to do with an expectation of competence. 

People like to call it "elitist".  It's not, generally.  It's simply a
"comfort zone".  The group isn't looking for a challenge, they are looking
for competent efficiency in achieving a goal.
