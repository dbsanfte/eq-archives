What I would suggest (and what I did myself) is go to HighHold Pass and get
in an orc group until 17 or so, then go to Paludal Caverns until 24/25ish
then go to High Hold Keep till 34, and then hunt in Rathe Mtns in giant
groups, which is what I'm currently doing.  That's when you'll start to see
the money rolling in. 7-11pp splits in a three person group (ideal, you,
warrior, druid) will definitely make the bank a lot fuller.  Plus, with your
rez spells, until that point, you'll be making money there (unless your a
charity cleric and rez for free) so you won't worry so much about loot.
Mind you, I never charge a guildie or someone I'm grouped with for a rez.
That's basically your job.  But when someone interupts you in a group and
asks for a rez, expect a donation.  I never put a price tag on it, and I
tend to find that while some of the donations are like pennies in a cup for
a bum, sometimes, just sometimes, people will hand you money that will make
your eyes bug out at that level.  Enjoy, clerics are MUCH fun to play.
