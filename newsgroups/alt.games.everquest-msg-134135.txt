Then by now you should know how to use your killfile. :p  But in case you
don't, click on their subject line then click Message >> Block Sender.

You've been on this newsgroup long enough to know if his contributions
outweigh his annoyance factor.

BTW, I find it hard to equate bully with "kitty."  I equate his actions with

It's ok to feel sorry for him but there's no crime with just KFing him.
