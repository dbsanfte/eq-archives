We have a free a society as any other country on earth. we just don't
have written down in so many words, it's more and assumption that
hasn't ever been refuted. i will grant you there are some very bad
things in our past and our present, but we still live in a free
country. our current issues are complex ones like immigration  and sex
worker centres and zones where it's hard to know what to believe.

I think in australia, religion doesn't hold quite as much power in the
media and political arena as it doesw in the states.
