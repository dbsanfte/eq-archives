Then Move it to a page of Hpotkeys that is not near your combat keys.

No but I go AFK to do this while I am AFK my character might as well be
behind a bush relieving his bladder.
Do they shower? Possibly if you want to think of all the time I spend not on
line adventuring.

Yes, if you like. You are complaining about the mechanics of a very simple
game because you are struggling with it's complexeties.

Then don't press the key, you are in control of your character, you might
not control if his spell fizzles or if he hits that Drolvarg but it is down
to you not to start looking around the floor for something to eat or pulling
your bandages out and trying to bandage your opponent mid fight.

Well wasting mana trying to nuke something, unsuccessfully and then spending
all that time medding, regenerating and cannibalising to get his mana back
might sound like fun to you but I doubt it does to anyone else.

The game is stacked against you, a single 45th level mob is a match for 3
45th level warriors, the npc casters rarely need to stop casting and if they
do it's only for about 10 seconds before they start again, the computer
doesn't have to worry about hot keys or lag or what spells to mem but the
computer has no real intelligence and it is assumed the player has, thus
being able to over come all the odds stacked against them.

You want more spells to be able to mem, sure, I want more hitpoints and
while we're at it can I hit as hard as slate, please, he's a lower level
than I am.

While we're at it, can we also reduce or remove falling damage, you'd never
actually jump of a cliff in error. Also can I be level 60 now, this would be
easier than actually having to play the game.

Oh yes, I am going to extremes but I am trying to prove a point, hundreds of
people per server have tolerated all the "problems" that you are seeing,
dealt with as part of the game and put made it to 50 the 60th level. They
never tried to bring down console and type /godmode on (well they might have
wanted it to at 45th)
The game isn't perfect but that is how it is, I dislike quite a few things
about it but I like a lot more than I dislike which is why I still play it,
otherwise I wouldn't bother.
I'm not saying don't make criticisms about the game but what you are
complaining about are there as penalties not bugs or oversights. The Spell
book is a penalty, it gets removed at level 35 in the same way as damage
caps get removed at 10th and 20th level. The maximum spells is a penalty,
you must now choose the best 8 for the job in hand (take as the brains
ability to memorize magic) everyone else does it and succeeds, go on, excel
yourself. No auto mapping, what do you think this is? Doom? even Quake2
doesn't have an auto mapper.
