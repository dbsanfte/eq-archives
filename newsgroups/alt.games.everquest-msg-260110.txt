Personally? I'd rather have a system where you agro'd, the mob would
be exclusive to that person for no more than a reasonable time to kill
it, and had a timer for rekilling. Mobs would instantly respawn. So
you would have 10 people hanging around Fippy Darkpaw killing it
whenever they came off timer and the quest item drop rate would
determine the time sink for the quest. But that's just me.
