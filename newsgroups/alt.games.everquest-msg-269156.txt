Wouldn't you say they go hand in hand? If too many individuals experience
aren't maximized the health will surely suffer. I agree that consolations
must be made to such things as gameplay, environment, and current
progamming limitations, but the bottom line is if too many people aren't
enjoying the game it will die.

It would be nice if they could program is dynamically - that the game
"senses" the player is having difficulty and will adjust the encounters to
help the player along. However, done hamfistedly, it would probably turn
into the same effect as some are complaining about WoW - it's too linear
and "easy".

True and hopefully a happy medium will be found. The problems occur
*because* of such diversity. Where do the designers draw the line with
regards to making the experience enjoyable to the majority of players? I'm
not a programmer and don't know how effective dynamic coding can be but the
answer must lie there somewhere. It seems to me we're scratching the
surface with instancing and such, but I think this will ultimately detract
from the game. I guess Occam's razor is why I can't become a programmer - I
can only think in those "straight" lines.
