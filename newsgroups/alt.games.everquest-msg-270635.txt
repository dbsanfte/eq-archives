This is something I can't understand. Have you visited the Qeynos
suburbs. The lovely halfling village or the cold dwarfen settlement?
I find the Qeynos side quite versatile. However I was disappointed with
Freeport! Every single suburb is the same slum like place. I did try a
dark elven rogue there but was really annoyed what has become of such a
proud race. Even though I did like way the npcs there talked to me I
couldn't stand the way my home town looked. And I didn't even had a
choice. Be it Troll or ogre or ratonga or whatever - all had the exact
same slum to live in. So at least for the Freeport side I can second
your concern.

Amen to that. I really hope they do merge servers. Especially the ubi
servers as they are nearly dead imho.
