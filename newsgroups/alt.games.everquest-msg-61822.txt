I use a 32mb Radeon DDR and it works great with EQ! For TV-out you can
get a Radeon 32mb VE card. The card ships with a 5--6foot S-video
cable, and works great for TV-Out. Check out the following link for
specs:

ATI RADEON VE 32MB AGP DDR DUAL DISPLAY VGA//DVI (White box) *No extra
DVI adapter. Detail Specs  $65.00USD

I have spent a LOT of money with this company over the years, and I
have always been 100% satisfied with their service, selection, and
prices.

If you do go with a Radeon, be sure to get the latest drivers from:
