WTF, is this suddenly a class in cryptic questions? If you have
something to add concerning taunt, add it. Drop me like a heart
attack, debate my ass into the dirt, show me the ass end of that broom
handle, but don't waste my time or expect i'm suddenly going to answer
baited questions because you're too lazy to come up with and write a
logical argument.

You don't really know how Usenet works, do you?

Or maybe you do and just trolling for responses is your thing. I seem
to recall you had some pretty good arguments in other threads so i'll
give you the benefit of the doubt for now.
