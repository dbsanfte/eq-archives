No, it was more along the lines of laughing at someone and saying 'it
couldn't have happened to a better guild'.

Yes, during my Lurking phase, I was fairly impressed by Martin's
posts.  That's why I was careful to grind my axe on his guild and not
attack him personally once I found out his guild affiliation.  But I
must confess that my opinion of him dropped considerably when I found
out he was in Stasis.

I _know_ you're not so new to Usenet that you are unfamiliar with
thread-hijacking and topic-drift, so I assume this is more smokescreen
meant to distract us from the fact that you can't refute a single word
I've said.

And I did address the question.   I said

"/cheer that gm  (in the unlikely event that he actually did
anything.)"

Or did you miss that part?

You mean the circumstances of you disagreeing with me?

Truly, I am crushed by that.

I think guild affiliation says a lot about a person.  Choosing to
remain in a guild that behaves dishonorably reflects on that members
honor.

Then I eagerly await your commentary on the recent KSing thread (which
has drifted to a discussion of debuffing mobs, and thence to a
discussion of the changes to pumice stones) and the other ten thousand
recent examples of topic-drift and straightforward thread hijacking.

Then stop shovelling it.
