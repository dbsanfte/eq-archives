I know that runner mobs will start doing the death march when they get
to below 20% health.  I also know that if you cast a snare type spell
on the mob before they get to 20% health, it won't attack you when
they do the death march; however, if you cast root on the mob before
it gets below 20%, it won't do the death march at all and will keep
fighting to the death while rooted.  What about when the mob starts to
do the death march and you root it then?  Will it change its mind and
then fight you to the death, or will it continue to do the death march
even after it's rooted?

Thanks in advance,
