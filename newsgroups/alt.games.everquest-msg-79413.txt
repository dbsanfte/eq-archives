Even better,  get banned for deliberatly training lol.

You have no control over the mobs other people kill, and you have NO RIGHT
interfering with their kill.

You didn't die because they killed the guard, you died becase YOU screwed
up.  Be it bad tactics, getting an add, whatever, that is YOUR screwup.

Baikhal, just for training that guy I made my mind up your a prick.. and I
don't even know you.
