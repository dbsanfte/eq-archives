I think you're perhaps sticking to 80% too hard.  My wizard (now 63rd) 
has been learning hard the theory of mana regen and mana expenditure.

My wizard operates at 40% mana generally.  What this means in reality is 
that the first few fights involve much fun nuking, and then he moderates 
his damage output to maintain roughly 40% mana.  With 40% mana and my 
gear, I can keep a couple of mobs rooted for a nice long time, snare 
some stuff, drop a couple of small mana efficient nukes, and still have 
enough to evac when it goes tits up.

And if something needs killing *right now* then 40% of may mana will 
usually do the trick quite nicely thank you very much :)

So I'm doing the same as you, but the numbers are different.  *However* 
this is when I'm grouped with my friends.  Who I trust.  We know what 
each other are doing, what we are likely to do next, and how we'll 
handle it if things go bad.  If I'm in a pickup group I might operate at 
50% or higher if I think I may need to do more crowd control than 
normal.  And in some camps, such as BoT entrance, I operate at around 
5%, because the zone is a short run away, so I don't need any more mana 
than that.

But all operating at 5% means is that in the first four fights I nuked 
like a loon, and from then on, I nuke at pretty much my normal rate, 
which is three or four per mob depending on the fight length.

When 'our' group is playing, we co-ordinate what we're doing so that we 
don't need to med, we're always pulling, and we change the pull rate to 
keep everyone with some mana, but not full.  This is usually driven by 
our cleric because they know how many CHeals they have left in them.
