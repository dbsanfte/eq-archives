And you, as a bard, are sure of this?  In all situations?  I'm telling you I've frequently
seen sloppy rez situations take several minutes before all the bodies are found and rezed.
As the primary rezer I'm very aware of this when its happening.  As a bard who has a cleric
main, I'm aware of it when I'm in a raid and other people are doing a slapdash job of it.

Hmm, funny, I'd have said the same about you.  I present carefully reasoned arguments, you
make blank statements that seem to ignore my actual questions or any points I've made.

Look, for example, at this post of yours here.  Did you come up with anything to make it
clear how mass rez situations can be handled quickly?  Or did you just state, baldly, that
they -are- fast, without any idea of why that is?

Is it possible that the rez situations you are thinking of are being handled in some
sensible way that you don't even know about, because you aren't the dragger or the rezzer?
Or is it possible that your idea of "no time" and mine are radically different, that because
you've never seen fast rezzing you think of what you are used to as "no big deal" fast
enough?  I can't tell, because you offer no details.

Its hard for me to respond at length to your posts like this one, because you don't offer a
handle.  Look at Martin's posts.  I disagree with him a lot... but I can get into detail
about the nuts and bolts of that disagreement, because he makes his case in detail.  Then he
can look at my arguments and attack them on their merits, so we can go back and forth and
maybe come to some agreement in the end, or at least understand the other's point of view.

So I end up discussing your posting style itself, rather than the merits of your argument.
Having only come to knock heads with you a few times so far, I can still hope that you'll
develop into someone worth tangling with, so I keep trying that.  Seeing you accuse me of
exactly the behavior I think I see in you makes me doubt that's ever going to work out,
which would be a pity, because new voices capable of writing in complete sentences with
capitalization and some sense of style are rare enough on the net, and particularly because
you've apparently got a body of experience in the high end game and as a bard I'd like to
tap into.
