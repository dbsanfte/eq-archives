The problem was that they referenced a file in EQUI.xml that they didn't
push down.  As soon as anybody zoned, they crashed.  Default UI, custom UI,
it didn't matter.  You zone, you crash, no exceptions.

If "*one*" person had done even the most basic testing in a legitimate way,
this would have been found.  Really, with Sony's history of screwing things
up on patch days it's hard to argue that they test things adequately (and
sometimes it's hard to argue that they test things at all).
