Oh yeah, it can. I've helped two clerics camp their epics all the way 
through. For my wife's, I think we were there for three straight nights, 
about seven hours each. He can be tedious to get to pop. Another we got 
in one night after five hours or so.

I don't remember a really safe spot near there, no. But if you are high 
enough level to solo in there, you could probably log in and slug it 
out. If you are lower level and need to group, I'd settle in for the 
long haul unless you have a way of ensuring everyone is logging in at once.

Hrmmm... then cleric may not be the class for you to go epic in. :-)

Sitting for hours at a time is practically the definition of the cleric 
epic.
