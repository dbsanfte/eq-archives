What are you talking about. WoW won't be out for at LEAST three years,
and that is assuming its NOT affected by Blizzard's patented "Game has
been delayed by another 18 months as we try to figure out what we are
doing".

If EQ is still going strong in three years then I'd say they have
earned their bucks. Heck, as the most popular MMORPG two and a half
years after their release, I think they've earned their spot NOW.

You shouldn't top post btw.

Now the man around the corner swore he'd kill the cat on sight,
so he loaded up his shotgun with nails and dynamite!
He waited and he waited for the cat to come around;
Ninety-seven pieces of the man is all they ever found....
