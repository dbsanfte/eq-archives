65 Ranger with 196 AA's, elemental bow, shooting in melee range thus
doing double damage.  They do die in about 5-10 seconds, maybe 15 if
they are lucky.  Not only this but with track, sorted normal, you can
grab the newest pop as soon as you are done with the first.  There is
no downtime.  With SoE, you get there fast.  I think that this is
probably one of the fastest ways to solo Hill Giants...and the most I
have ever made in an hour is 1.2-1.5k.
