With a possible period of free time coming up for some serious EQing
this week/end, I'm hopeful that I may make it to 30. (Currently leveling
fast in HHK and am at 26, halfway to 27 troll warrior).  At that point,
I'd like to move on to new hunting grounds.  Between reccomendations
from friends and reading stuff here, I've seen a few possibilities.

While I'm obviously still interested in solid xp to get out of hell
level, I'm *really* interested in amassing cash for all the gems for my
crafted armor and some 1HS weapons upgrades, HP/AC jewelry, etc.  I've
gotten spoiled by being in a zone where there's a bunch of guildies and
and friends I've come to know and hunt with there for six levels, so
I've most always had a group.  When I move on, though, I fear I'll be
back into looking for pickup groups, so I would like to temper my choice
of next hunting area with one where there are well established spawn
areas where one can find a fast moving p/u group.
  Any input from those who have already been past the first hell level
with a melee type would be most appreciated.
