I'm sure you do. Ooc ... where do you hunt outdoors mostly?...because 
there are a lot of outdoor zones on Luclin and in the PoP.


Either way, the average outdoor zone in Norrath is empty. With 
populations routinely reaching as high as 5 in NorthK, or WestC, or the 
Emerald Jungle, or the Eastern Wastes, ... (including my group)

Other than raid groups assembling, and ldon groups assembling the great 
majority of the population plays either underground in the ldon, on the 
moon, or in the pop.

Seasons in the Karanas would be woefully underappreciated.
