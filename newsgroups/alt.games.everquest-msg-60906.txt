Well, you see, that was actually a part of the early design.  Back in the day,
back before warriors got critical hit, and when roguess coulldn't sneak/hide
at the same time nor evade in combat, when we had to walk to Qeynos through
the snow, barefoot, uphill both ways...   this was one of the early challenges
for your character.   Obtaining a magical weapon, so that you were not
defenseless against the ghouls, and could hunt wisps for cash (since they were
the only way for a low level to actually get some platinum.)

From about level 8 to 11 I crawled through blackburrow nonstop, saving up
every little gold piece until I got enough money for a combine scimitar.
(about 60 pp from vendors) That was about the only option, since there were no
gnoll hide laraits, or velium weapons in the game.  Then together with a druid
friend, I killed wisps up to the 100 pp level, where I was able to buy a
combine 2 hander, and she then used the combine scimitar.

Those were our early levels.

This has always been a problem in EQ.  Mobs dropping non level appropriate
gear.   Level 25 mobs dropping Rawhide armor, which isn't fit for anything
more than a newbie.  Level 30's dropping ringmail, which isn't suited for
anyone.  But even more than that, you have to remember that you're now dealing
with a game that has 3 classes of items.   Pre-Kunark, Kunark and Velious
(soon to add a 4'th).   Each time an expansion comes out, a new class of items
is born.  Each class of items has slightly better damage delay ratios, and/or
is acquirable at lower levels...  Verant feels it needs to be this way to
convince people to go after them, rather than camping the same loot they did
before the expansion.


Back in the day, that sword that he was talking about, Gladius, was a kick ass
sword for the mid levels.  People were very happy to get one.  Nowadays it
isn't even fit for twinks.  Those better ratio lower level drops in the
expansions completely outclass it.    You can see the same effects anywhere.
Every time our guild does Plane of Fear, we get at least a few Eyerazzia's
that rot.  (Rogue weapon, 9 dam 25 delay, nodrop)   Before Kunark, Rogues, who
were generally dual wielding 8 dam 28 delay Serrated Bone Dirks at level 46+
would have loved them I would imagine.  But nowadays the rogues come in
wielding at the very least a Slime Covered Harpoon (Kunark drop 10 dam 25
delay) and usually a Ragebringer, if they waited until 51 to go to Fear.

It would be nice if they redid the drops to put them on correct level mobs for
the current equipment level of the game, (and made the monsters all have
kunark / velious level hit points while they were at it) but I can certainly
see why they don't.  That would be a tremendous job requiring enough manpower
to grind thier expansion progress to a halt for a few months, and each time
another class comes out, it would have to be done all over again.
