It's a rollback. You only see them on production servers VERY rarely.
(At least big enough ones that you'd notice. Generally, if there's a
crash and a rollback one or two minutes in time you won't pick up on
it.)

Play on the test server some time. There are frequently unannounced
rollbacks of up to five or six hours. You can lose a lot of xp, cash,
etc. that way, depending what you were doing.

Basically, it's SoE resetting the server (and all the characters and
their possions) to some "hard save" from a previous time. Generally done
when something gets *seriously* fucked up.
