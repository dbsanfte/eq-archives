I'm not talking about normal items, picking up rotting fine steel or cleaning
out newbie yard trash corpses.

I'm talking about a situation like the one our guild was in the other day.
We were in Kael with a 5 group raid, killing level 58 giants for Coldain Quest
armor drops.   It is not always possible to get that many people together so
all eligible people can roll on an item.   We tried to have a person holding
the corpse each time while we were rolling, but if the drop came on a double
or triple pull, those giants have thousands and thousands of hit points, and
hit multiple times for over 300 a pop.    Its not always possible for us to
get people looting it and holding it in the middle of a fight like that.

That does not however mean that in our eyes, the armor piece was "up for
grabs" to the level 2 ogre that wandered past in the middle of the fights, and
hung out a while (probably hoping for just such a situation.)
