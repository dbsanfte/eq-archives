208 skill in Blacksmithing, 37 base charisma, low base int/wis too. 

Even if I had 255 charisma and maxed faction, nothing I could make with
208 skill would make me a greater profit from selling what I make, than
I could get in the same amount of time from killing creatures.

Pick up a few high +cha items for buying and selling to vendors, but 60
cha will not make the difference between profit and loss over a long
period of time, if cha is the only consideration
