Yeah, we get rental out of the eq, but you people charge a fortune for
a dish and receiver.

Yeah, Road Runner will send out a tech if you scream loud enough.

We send out a truck, free of charge, as many times as it takes to get
the service working right. If a customer starts abusing it, say,
wanting us to replace the batteries in the remote every other week,
yeah, we threaten to charge them. I've never seen them do it though.

I talked with a DTH cust that had a larger dish. Said he never had any
problems during weather. Then again, he shelled out a bit more for
that larger dish.

How about none. We don't have access cards, whatever those are.

Yeah, I've heard a lot of people complain how they'd go to dish except
that they aren't allowed to have one where they live. Yeah, I feel
real sorry for them... not.
