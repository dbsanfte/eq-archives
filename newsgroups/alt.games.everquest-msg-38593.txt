	Being someone else's gofer isn't fun, but the newbies aren't just being
someone's else's gofer, so what's your point?

	No.  YOU are.  *The newbies are killing the bats anyway!*  3/16/99, WE
were out there killing bats and decaying skeletons, only when we got our bat
wings and bone chips we took them to the vendors and got a few silver.  Today,
the newbies killing those mobs see high level players offering lots more for
them, or savvy low level ones selling them for lots more, so they save them
for other players and get platinum instead.

	Basically, you just completely missed the point.  The things newbies have
to do at low levels are more lucrative for them then they were for us.

|Put your level 50 away and bang bats for money if you think it is so great.
|No frigging way you are going to do it. It sucks, hard.

	If I'm going to level up a new PC, my options are either go kill the bats
or get a guildmate to PL me.  Newbies don't have the PL option.

|A much more satisfying experience would be had if a newbie could quest for a
|~8/30 weapon or at least farm it vs kill bats and rats.

	They're going to get to do that soon enough, but they're STILL going to
have to kill the bats first.  They'll just 100 times more coin out of the
effort than we did.
