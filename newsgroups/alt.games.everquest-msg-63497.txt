Updating the old world areas with new TEXTURES alone is voluntary
evidently while you install Luclin. I guess there is an additional CD
it comes with with the more detailed textures.

Again, its just textures. Its not more detailed 3d grass or anything.

Its on the luclin page under features:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/luclin/features.jsp

"When EverQuest originally shipped in 1999, the development team
utilized 32 x 32 low-resolution pixels because of graphics technology
at the time. With the advent of superior graphic cards, the upgraded
texture resolution featured in EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin will
be 256 x 256 pixels and occasionally as large as 512 x 512 pixels.
This vast improvement in quality will make Norrath appear more vibrant
and detailed than ever before. Check out this Media Alert for more
information."

Click on the screenshots below that statement and you see, for
example, the freeport bank. Along the bottom you will see "new
textures" click on "old texture" to compare. In many of those shots
the ground is what appears to be more textured.
