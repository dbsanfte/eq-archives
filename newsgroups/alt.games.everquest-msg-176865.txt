Does anyone know what are good servers? I'm new and have been playing
on Lanys T'Vyl, because some friends suggested it, but my characters
aren't anywhere near their levels, so we really don't interact much,
so I was wondering what are some good suggestions for servers? I've
heard about Firiona Vie as the RP server, and I don't care for PK
games. I want someplace where RP is accepted, people are friendly and
it's not so crowded every zone has players queued like an amusement
park line to get to the lone monsters respawing. So, any suggestions,
or sites where I could find out about the different servers?

p.s. This is a serious request, not an attempt to start a 'my place is
better' or 'that place sucks rocks' war.
