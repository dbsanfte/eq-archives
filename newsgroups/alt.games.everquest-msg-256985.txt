POJ exit is a static camp, mobs which never ever aggro unless teased, a 
nice safe killing spot (unless you want to kite).  Its training wheels, 
though, for really playing the zone; once you level a bit more so you 
don't get crazy aggro, you can roam around killing, going from room to 
room, keeping the halls clear.  And its not killing the same mob over 
and over, they differ wildly in type and in appearance, the only factor 
they share is that you aren't KOS to them... oh, and they practically 
never drop loot.

Deeper in you can find some mobs that are aggro, and they drop loot more 
often, in fact one of the most lucrative cash camps in the game is the 
POJ jail/Punisher Enforcer camp, where the trash drops are worth 50pp 
and the 260pp gem drops are frequent.  Then there's the caves, which 
I've never done because by the time I had a character high enough level 
not to aggro thru the walls I was only in POJ when soloing, and I 
couldn't take the heat down there.  Heard good things though.

I haven't done any of that yet with my Berzerk, as he's still in that 
awkward low level range where he can cause trouble for people by 
aggroing things at a distance if he tries to fight in place.

Grage, 50 Berzerk, Luclin
