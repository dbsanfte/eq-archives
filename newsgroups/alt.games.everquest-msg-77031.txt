If anyone has any more tips on how to help Orlun draw aggro on the
general, please post them in this thread. I won't be MA on this attack
(Thank god!) but I'll be up in his face. I'm willing to take a shot at
learning to backstab if the General wants to go whack on Orlun for a
while. 
;-)

So, what's this guy hit for anyway?
