Yep, you could also go to velious at around level 35 or so in great
divide in bear groups to 42 about when it greens out.. and mix in some
Crystal caverns in Eastern wastes anytime in there also. Then you can
get up to 60 basically at the rygorr fort in East wastes in groups but
of course you'd want to head off to money spots like seb or karnors,
howling stones, even kael,   or what not before that. Skyshrine in
groups around 39 would be great also, but its kind of bring your own.
Fantastic armor (for non twinks and even really twinks) can drop in
their off guardians rarely.
