BABS is probably the highest damage weapon for the money - and I got
mine for 125pp.  Easily out-damages dual wield until lvl 35+ unless
you have multi-Kpp 1HS weapons.  Also, with the reasonably slow delay
you won't take so much agro in groups if you don't want it, which is a
nice bonus.  Just be ready to switch in some fast 1HS for when you
come up against a caster you need to interrupt.
