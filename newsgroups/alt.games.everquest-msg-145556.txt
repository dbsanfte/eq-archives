I think 99% of doomshades loot is junk.. I mean sure he has a sweet earing,
a pretty nice bow.. but the weapons, the bracers..  so subpar :/  Ft is nice
but those stats make it pretty undesirable - it went to a bot when we first
got 1 to drop, purely because of that.

Btw, im sure you know this, but kiting RC isnt too difficult, everything
agros so pull 1 from the top and you clear the whole entrance, meanwhile
everybody hurridely runs for the zone.

We've had an entire cheal rotation team, consisting of *1* real person in
the past

Its a much better spot, because of its distance to RC and Doomshade, but few
to no pulling adds?  Your joking right? :)

Those tribal dudes regularly "patrol" just out of camp agro range (but
inbetween the camp and doomshade), the dark masters also have several dark
assassins in very close range (like 7, just on the front).  Umbral has funky
agro too.. its like a revamped PoF!

Agro range is huge, and mobs are extremely difficult to blur.  The assassins
are on a very fast repop too.

Don't get me wrong its not a hard pull, but its not an add free spot, let
alone add free zone

Its a worse case scenario... e.g max hit in a round, no riposte, no blocks,
counting flurry damage too

Why didn't you F8 and /assi Gozz?

Square helm and that crappy bracer from Karnors, both have extended range 3
on them :)

Sounded like 4c to me.. did you guys manage to keep all corners down, with
just 1 group? :)
