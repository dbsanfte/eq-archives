You said a lot I don't agree with, but if thats how you view things I
won't dispute that thats how they look to you, they just look a lot
different to me.  This one thing I did want to respond to though, as
there is a very good reason for the enchanter to call next target. 
Since he is the one who has been mezing the adds and will have to
continue to do so if there are more than one parked, he knows which one
is the bastage who kept resisting his stuns and mezes while you fought
the first one.  That is the mob that goes next.  Again, maybe you've
never tried that, or maybe you did and it doesn't work for you, I just
know thats how we deal with it in my party and it works great.  We let
the warrior think he is leading the party but we all know its really the
cleric who is in charge <G>.
