See my last post. Certain access numbers/areas first. Now confirmed to
me by AOL after I kicked up holy hell with them. They are now actually
in breach of their own T&C and also are using false advertising. "Join
AOL and you can stay online as long as you like without having to
watch the clock". Let's see them explain that to the advertising
standards body.

Nope, I've been on the AOL unmetered flat rate since it started. As a
non-BT 'phone line user I jumped at it as it was my only unmetered
option at that time, and especially attractive because of the no cut
off period.

>using 5.0. Are you using 6? Perhaps it's tied into that?

Nope, I have tried 5.0, 6.0 and the new 7.0, all were patched. If I
load a fresh AOL from CD I don't get bumped, as soon as I log, or get
cut, and the client gets automatically updated I get the forty minute
bump again. 

I reckon it will be coming to your access number soon, so make the
best of it while you can...

Thanks to Conrad I've found a cure also now though :).

Regards,

B.B.
