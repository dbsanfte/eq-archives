Fine Antique Ring:  ac3 30hp 20mana Mana Preservation 2
[all components are droppable, thus buyable in bazaar]
High Quality Cougarskin (rare drop off snow cougars in IC or EW)
Undead Froglok Tongue (drops off undead frogs in LGuk)
Cockatrice Beak (drops off the various cockatrices in OT and DL)
Tiny Rockhopper Eye (drops in Shar Vahl newbie zone ?Hollowshade?)

It's not unusual to find an HQ Cougar skin for 20pp or less (they
seem to drop off about 1 cougar in 20, Druids quad cougars in IC).
The tongue is easy (20% to 25% drop rate?).  The beak is likewise
easy and about as common as the tongue.  I've not actually looted
a Tiny Rockhopper Eye, buy off vendors just inside Shar Vahl for
less than 2 silver.

I've completed this quest for under 9pp with a L5 Druid.

Also, at L4 get yourself a Sarnak Blood and do the
Fine cut, Inlaid Diamond Mask:  ac3 3int 3wis 10mana 10hp Spell Haste 2
(not sure if I recall stats perfectly).  SoW reduces the risk of
failure on the run thru Droga, but under L10 failure just means
try, try, again.

Unless you enjoy equipping gear your character has "earned for himself",
so to speak.
