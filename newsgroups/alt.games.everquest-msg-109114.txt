What he is trying to say that if there is a big difference between you and
the mob and a big difference between you and your MT, that the AI system may
often target you as being lower to quickly kill you. The AI works at killing
weaker people first. This is why if you get below 1 bubble of heal, ever
single mob in an area will turn on you regardless of who they hated most
before.

In this case, the ranger was in an area fighting level 51-60 mobs as a level
48 ranger. That make it difficult for him to begin with because the mobs
will preceive him as weak due to level. Furthermore, the main tank was level
58 which the mobs will preceive as being strong. If all agro facts are
equal, the mob will attack the lower level person over the higher level
person. Heck, high level ranger can use a major agro sword like Earthcaller
which procs a slow-damage dot and many times never receive agro if they
happened to be the highest level melee present.

PS> Sometimes, there is not much you can do to keep from occassionally gaing
a mobs attention. How you re-act in those situations is what determines more
of how well you play your character, as a ranger.
