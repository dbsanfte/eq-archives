Actually I'd have to disagree.  Vitriol, yes.  Allusions to ancestry, yes.
But there's absolutely no need to delve into profanity.  If you can't insult
someone thoroughly without profanity, you (to me, anyway) show a lack of
imagination.

For example, this is one I had occasion to demonstrate a couple of years
back in this very newsgroup:  "You raddled offspring of a syphilitic goat
and a scabrous sow".  See?  No profanity, but I do think it gets the point
across.
