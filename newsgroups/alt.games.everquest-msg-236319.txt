Uhm...what you've just done there is called "bottom posting", and has been
the accepted convention on usenet for ~20 years.

"Top posting" is when someone puts all of their material at the top, and
then follows it with either all of the quoted post, or (in rare cases) part
of the quoted post.

The thing you are doing that is odd (very odd...I don't recall seeing anyone
else ever do it) is that you have a bottom posted section, and then at the
end you append the entire original post.
