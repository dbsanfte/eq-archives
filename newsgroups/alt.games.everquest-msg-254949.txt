Must be a level thing.  At level 65, I have found no traps that kill the 
entire party, and we've set off many of them.  I have RGC, as well as 
group cure disease/poison, so don't usually have nay trouble with curing 
what ails group members either.  OTOH, the reward for opening boxes 
invariably appears to be not worth the trouble, so, we've stopped 
bothering.
