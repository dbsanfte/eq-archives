My favorite of the many, many stupid moves I've made was when my
little druid first made 14 and got SoW.  He goes to Surefall Glade to
buy, scribe and mem his level 14 spells.  I cast SoW on myself
proudly.  Run outside to Qeynos Hills and, sure enough, someone shouts
that he'll pay, I don't remember, 3pp or something for a sow.

"I'LL COME!!!" I practically shriek and go tearing off across the zone
to the guard tower where the guy is waiting.  But being new to all
this, I click on the wrong shoe icon and Snare the guy, to which the
guards took exception.

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT....

The crowning indignity, of course, was that I lost level 14 and could
no longer SoW.....
