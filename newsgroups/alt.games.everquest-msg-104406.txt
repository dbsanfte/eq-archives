This demonstrates perfectly the difference in perspective between
melee and healers.  Healers tell you 20%, 40%, 60%... as an indication
of how long its going to take before you get to full mana.  Melee want
the next mob asap.  This is flawed thinking on the melee part, you
should always pull at 80% to fm.  You are _NOT_ gaining any time
(expcept maybe a one time 3 minute romp) by pulling asap.  It takes
exactly the same time to med from 0 to 30% and it does for 50 to 80. 
Fighting at near full mana saves lives there by saving time.  If you
want to speed things up,  look for more effective ways of tanking,
damage dealing.  You can't speed up mana.

Depends on level, celestial healing if available, it aggros as much as
a buff and give 40 mana per tick.  Cost more than regular heals tho,
thats why we like to have enough mana, keeps our options open.  If
your healers are getting aggroed alot heres the reasons:  healer
doesn't understand aggro management, your ma is way outclassed by the
mob hes fighting (if the mob is doing way more damage than the ma is
doing to the mob), your fighting in a bad area where you getting a lot
of adds (poor stratedgy, planning), your not giving the healer enought
time to get you up to full health between fights.

Most learn this before long.

Druids for the most part are clueless when it comes to groups, i have
never played one don't know why.  If you know your gonna have to run,
run early, it takes a lot less time to recover.  What I do is instead
of suggesting people run or ordering them too, is simply say 'I am
running, run now if you can', then run, and don't look back.  I know
this may seem cold, but in that situation there is no time for
argument, and if you stick around to give people time to get out they
will just stand there thinking 'are we running?' and your 'valiant
last stand' will be in vain.  Its hard to get the herd running until
someone goes down, but by that time it is usually too late.  Sure some
people will die with this method, but self preservation is a good
lesson to learn early on.  There are also times to make a stand so
your party can get out.  But reserve this manuver for when you know at
least one will use it for the benefit of the party.

Failure is the best teacher.  Its not as simple as it seems.

monks should pull anytime you need to split up a group, and if the
possibility of adds along the way is there (every dungeon, for
example).  Monks are the best pullers.
