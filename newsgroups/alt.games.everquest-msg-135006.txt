This is my assessment as well.  Went up the the bazaar about 1200pm
EST and there were 288 people in the bazaar.  Took my computer down at
a crawl.  People thought the gfay would become a ghost town once
/auction came around and gfay is still quite active on my server.  I
think that initially that people will flock to the bazaar but things
will slowly return to normal once the novelty wears off.  I for one am
not going to make a trip to luclin just to look for something.  Heck,
most of the time I do not know what I want.  I will see some item in
auction that I never heard of then I look up stats on other computer
to check  stats and determine whether I want to purchase.  There are
way too many items out there for me to go to the bazaar and do a
search and I am not going to go to vendor to vendor to see what wares
they have... =)  And of course, not everyone has Luclin...
