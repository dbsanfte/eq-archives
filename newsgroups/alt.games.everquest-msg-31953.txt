Subject: Logitech mouse problem

I got a new Logitech Optical mouse and installed in on my system.  The mouse
works fine but not with EQ.  On the game screen, the text scroll bar
continuously move up.  This makes incoming text information hidden.  One can
scroll the text screen to the bottom manually to read the text, but as soon as
one let the scroll handle go the handle just moves right to the top!

I talk to Logitech support and they told me to get a patch GAME_WHL.EXE to fix
the problem.  But it didn't fix the problem.  I checked to see if the patch
worked by looking at the WINDOWS Registry.   It has, and changed
MouseHookDLLEnable=0. 

Does anyone have answer to my problem?  My system is 233Mhz PC with WIN95 OS.
