I've been collecting components trying to get a friend an enchanted dorf BP,
I've got something like 18 drops of mercury on my mule, but no lava rocks,
also have a few swirly mists and essences of crap, yew leaves, a few velious
skins (make holgresh skins stack please) and a buttload of morning dews,
misty acorns and oak barks and probably other sundry things I don't
remember.
