Chardok Royals for a couple of cycles, including clearing down and
constant pulls other than the "gratz XXX on the epic piece" breaks.
Everything was blue and I got XP on 99% of the kills (only cleric
grouped with five wizards.)  I got just a bit under two yellows,
certainly more than 9 blues anyway.  No idea what the 60s in the
group were getting, but that XP was far, far better than a 55 cleric
could get solo, or even in an XP group, for that matter.

We did very few raids where the KS group would only get a blue.
The XP gotten while farming ToV for (seemingly endless) hours adds
up, for instance.  But, yeah, the XP doesn't matter if you just
pop into the zone and kill Gore or VS or any of the other quick
and easy kills.
