I suppose you are right... I probably could have made that less what
it was.  Sorry 'bout that.  And not that it matters, but the friends I
speak of are still playing everquest, and it's not just me who ceased
to see them, and all of their other friends as well.  I am less
inclined to doubt my gut feeling on this when all other people around
(totally apart from me)  feel the same way.  This leads to one of two
things:  a) these friends I speak of do actually have a problem, and
that fact that they don't see anyone anymore is because they told us
to fuck off when we gently suggested that maybe, just maybe, we should
go socialize, rather than play everquest for the thousandth night in
row. or b)the fact that myself and the others are concerned about
loved ones sacrificing pretty much everything (in one case a good job,
in another, a great, great girlfriend) and the fact that we care
enough about them to do something about their plight, makes us
heartless, egomaniacal, god-complex having, evil, terrible horrible
... caring friends?  I fail to see how that makes me a bad person...
have you ever had concern for a friend before?  I once had a drug
addiction problem... my friends intervened ... my first inclination
was to say "go fuck yourself... what the hell do they know about
anything?"  But then I thought about it... were they intervening to
fufilling some evil side of them?  Did they care about how I was
fucking up a lot of things because they were assholes?
Also... sitting around all day (I do mean all day) doing jack-fuck-all
but sitting in front of computer, collecting welfare to support their
meager existance (while being perfectly intelligent and capable) kind
of offends the shit out of me, and a lot of the people they call
friends.  But you're right... the fact that I care enough about me
friends to try to help them, totally makes me a fuckin asshole. 
Thanks for clarifying that for me.
