Bah, they're both god in completely independent ways.  Rice's vampires 
have the snooty romantic aloof immortal bit going on, and buffy kicks ass.

Hard to really consider a Buffyverse vampire as immortal, really.  You 
know they're only going to last a season or two at most.  Well, except 
Spike, of course.  And Angel.  But they don't count. :)
