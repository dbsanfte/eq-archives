Not sure you are right here, as I thought I'd seen that valley from the
outside when exploring in antonica. Like with other instanced zones eg
fighter's arena, the instance is within a normal zone and i suspect the
shard is recoverable as usual. Could always petition and they'd tell you if
there's an ingame way to recover it.
