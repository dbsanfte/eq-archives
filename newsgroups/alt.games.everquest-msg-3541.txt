It's not your video card and monitor that is crap in this case (you're
allowed to say that :) ), it's your race.  Humans are night-blind (and
honestly, their stats aren't very good anyway).  Barbarians and Erudites are
also night-blind.

You did pick a couple of tough things to start with...Kelethin/Greater
Faydark for your wood elf, and Neriak/Nektulos for your dark elf.  Yikes,
neither one are very user-friendly for new players.  Dwarves, gnomes, iksar
and halflings have an easier time of it.  I found the ogre's hunting area to
be a pain.  I've never played a troll.  High elves are probably easier than
wood elves.  They start in the same newbie area, but it's easier to find
your way through Felwithe (high elf town) than it is Kelethin...and when in
GFay, if you see Felwithe you SEE Felwithe.  Kelethin on the other
hand...sure, there's the town above you...NOW HOW THE HECK DO I FIND MY WAY
IN???

I'm not ragging on Kelethin...it's one of the things I love about EQ...but
it's not exactly easy to get around. :)

Since you didn't actually state your computer's specs I can't make any
comments about that.
