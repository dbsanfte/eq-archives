In my experience, AE dispell works the way you described.

Mob cast dispell seems like it can get different slots.    And dying is
definitely not the cause of this.   It's rare that I die in an experience
group.  It's not rare that a caster doing annul magic on me (or whatever
variation) can get my 1'st, 5'th and 8'th buff slots in one cast, leaving
all the others intact.

Cast dispell still tends to get the top slots most often, but skipped buffs
seem much much more common.
