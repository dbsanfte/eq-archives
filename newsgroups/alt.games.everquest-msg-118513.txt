No, I don't.  I haven't received it yet.  I haven't taken this character to
Luclin yet.  I made a necro as my first character, got it to level 26
somehow with miserable starting stats (first character, hehe), and made this
little gnecro about a month ago as an alt.  I haven't taken any "evil"
characters to the moon yet and was unsure about factions issues.
