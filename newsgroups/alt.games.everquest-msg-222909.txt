Hmm, I think you've identified the difference between the Christian 
version and Kant's version.  The difference is the Christian version says, 
"You should kill others if you want them to kill you".  Kant's version 
says "You should kill others if you want them to kill you and you don't 
care what happens to everyone else".  Still, in either case, it's possible 
for someone to be psycho enough that the statement is exhorting them to 
random murder.

No, it's not really self-interest.  If you're suicidal and too chicken to 
do it yourself, it's arguably in your self-interest to convnce others to 
kill you.  Suicide is generally, after all, described as a selfish act... 
Perhaps it's presupposing a desire for self-preservation.  Or more 
generally, it's presupposing that the listener is not psycho.  Of course, 
people who are not psycho in some way (whatever 'being psycho' really 
means) are probably those less in need of moral guidance, so perhaps the 
maxim fails most strongly for those it most needs to reach.

It's missing some aspect of needing to convey the importance of treating 
others as -they- wish to be treated, and not just as -you- wish to be 
treated.  The Rede gets that part pretty well, with 'An ye harm none'.  
Still not perfect, since it doesn't sugggest the value of doing nice 
things for other people, but hey.
