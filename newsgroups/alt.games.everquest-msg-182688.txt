    Lol but how much dmg is it going to do against those mobs?

    Well, no matter what I say someone's always going to bring out an
exception but I'm sure I'm getting the point across somewhere along the line

    If you rotate your pet summon and pet buff slot, the recast time on the
pet buff makes this a little annoying for your self buffs, but I put up with
it cos of the 8 gem restriction. Other than that my spell list is identical
to yours except that I'd swap out heat blood and put in the strength tap.
Nice spell to pull with if you don't want to snare, and +10 str probably
does more extra damage than the fire dot ;)

    I notice you're not using heart flutter... Guess you're not overwhelmed
by the stacking capability of the dots either?

    Yeah paid 250pp for mine too, before i bought it getting 250pp together
was a major undertaking. After I bought it I began fear kiting hill
giants...

    Yeah I don't like using cheap old dots for agro tho, i'd rather use a
taunt spell otherwise it feels like cheating. It is cheating really as its
an exploit, and one that sooner or later will be properly nerfed.

    I don't think level 30 was earth shattering spellwise. Probably the most
important spell before 49 was Fear when you first get it. I don't even
remember when that was but I wish I knew then what I know now about fear
kiting ;) would've made a right mess of many a nasty thing to my own gain.

    Yeah I'm looking forward to the new pet..... the 49 one just got old :)

    Mental corruption sounds interesting but doesnt set my world on fire,
but the faster recast feign death is the only useful thing SK's seem to get
out of ykesha and it wont make me fork out $20us or whatever.

cheers,
James
