Ok... can somebody explain for me exactly what it is about the
"pre-nerf" version of this item that makes is such a "cat's pajamas"
item that it's selling for anywhere from 30 to 45K PP and people are
fighting to get it?

Correct me if I'm looking up the wrong one, but the stats on this thing
are total crap, and it's only redeeming feature is an instant cast right
click invis.  Now sure, that invis is a pretty nice feature, but isn't
this usable only by SKs and Necros??? And again, correct me if I'm
wrong, but aren't these two classes who can cast a free, two second cast
time invis on themselves any old time they want anyway?  And if they
happen to be Dark Elves they can even HIDE ferkrissakes!

Unless this is way different from my wizard's invis spell, you get a
warning shortly before it fades. ("You feel as if you are about to
appear.") No matter where I've been sneaking around invis, I've never
had it fading in a spot where I couldn't run over out of the aggro range
of any local mobs and cast another one.

Or is it usable by all classes from the inventory? I can see where a
monk or a warrior would pay through the nose for an item like this, but
a Necro or SK??  What am I missing?  What makes this item so damned
desirable?
