Drinal has been my home for a very long time, and I've made
several good friends there.  But with the recent changes to
FV, I'm getting more fond of it the more time I spend
there.  I really, really, like the one-character no twink
thing.  Keeps me honest, and a bit more focused.  And I have
also met more role-players there.  The only reason I haven't
played it more up to now is language restrictions and lack
of zone wide /shout or /auction.  I'm fairly chatty, and not
really all the interested in playing with myself.  In game.

What is this "up" of which you speak?
