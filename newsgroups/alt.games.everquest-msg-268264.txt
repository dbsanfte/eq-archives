Thankfully, EQ2 seems pretty devoid of those types. I personally
prefer ye olde 31337 sp34k compared to that gayness. The social
servers for NWN used to be (and probably still are) filled with people
like that. And a lot of MUDs were like that too.

Maybe I just don't have much of an imagination, but it's kinda hard to
lose one's self in the fantasy when you're sitting around thinking
about levelups, max HP, to hit bonuses, spawn camping named mobs, and
zoning away from KoS groups.
