Yeah.. my friend who has a credit card and that I live with (he doesn't 
care if I use his card since he knows and trusts me like a brother) is 
out of town and I need to purchase a game card to log on, though EB 
Australia doesn't stock them (or at least my local one) and I cant find 
any place that does which is why I asked.

Being in a guild I dont like to let my guildies down, since I'm a solid 
mid-level cleric and am needed - but I guess a week or two without EQ 
wont hurt to recharge the old batteries. =)

Matt
