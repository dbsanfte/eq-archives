the other day, i realized that one of the things that greatly impressed me
from when i was new to the game was something that still impressed me -- 
it's something that anyone can go and try out, and i reckon, will enjoy

then i got to thinking that other people must have similar duplicable
moments that are worth trying out

so i thought i'd make a list, and i'd start it off with this:

*level 8 necro pet* as a level 8 necro, casting the level 8 pet spell will
summon a yellow-con skelly pet...level 8 is the easiest thing in the world
if you're a necro, because that skelly tears through anything

it's great!

*level 65 wiz crit* the very very first crit with SoS . . . okay, so not
everyone can try this out, but those who have should agree...that's a great
moment

it's also great! not as good as the lvl 8 pet, but very cool just the same

(i'm posting this because i just ran across the necro pet, and my first crit
at 65 always stood out (6048!), but i also think a "postive" thread might
help this week in A.G.E =P )
