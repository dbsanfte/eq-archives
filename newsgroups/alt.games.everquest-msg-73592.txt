Well if you did catch it as a joke, then kudos to you.  There were a pile of
people who assumed that I was serious, so I thought I'd have to further
elaborate for them.  As for the humor value of it, I guess it was just me
that found it funny.  Compounded only further with the number of replies and
the fact that nobody here clued in on the Bob Izumi sig.  Made for an
entertaining Monday none the less :)

Cheers!
