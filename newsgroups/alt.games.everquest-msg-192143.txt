Are you running Zonealarm by chance?  I noticed I was getting a popup
warning that "the program has changed" with this patch.  I had gotten
it before with other patches, but this one didn't actually popup. 
When it did, I was unable to move the mouse to answer it.  I ended up
having to start in windowed mode, yet I still couldn't release the
mouse cursor with alt-r or alt-shift-r.  I ended up having to swap to
Zonealarm with ctl-alt-delete and then allowing EQ access.
