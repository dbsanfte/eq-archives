I soloed the LRathe spawn at 54, I'm not sure a cleric can do so before that
point, the mob you are looking for, and many of his placeholders, are cleric
mobs (imagine that) complete with CHeal and some serious nukes.  In addition to
that, of course they hit harder than a comperable level ranger, and don't get
interrupted by normal combat blows, only by stuns or kicks etc.

What I did was pull back out of add range, then stun, pet, stun stun stun stun
stun stun stun till the pet killed them.  This prevented casting and cut
incoming damage down to a trifle, but also prevented my casting or doing melee
damage.   Using the pet (and back then the pet cost 600 mana to summon and
people had the thing shoved to the back of their spell books if they had it at
all) meant I could devote the remainder of my mana to nothing but stunning, and
rely on pet damage to do the killing for me.

With the addition of the bash skill, with a good weapon (heck, get a 56+ cleric
to summon you a hammer), you might be able to pull this off using legitimate
paladin style melee, using bash and stun interrupts only to stop spell casting
when you see the "starts to cast" message... but its going to take some skill.
