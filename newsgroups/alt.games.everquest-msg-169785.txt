Dwarven Male calls Dwarven Males:

All Dwarven males are "cousin", unless they don't have a beard, in which
case they're "lad", or they're obviously incompetent, in which case we're
into the "unprintable" category.

Dwarven Male calls Dwarven Females:

"Cousin" is always appropriate, as Dwarves are extremely equal-rights
oriented.  "Lass" will also sometimes be used.  "Young lass" is used when
speaking about (not with) a Dwarven female who hasn't yet grown her beard.

Dwarven Male calls Other Males:

If you can't or don't grow a beard, you aren't a man, you're a boy.  So, you
get called "lad".

Humans, even with beards, are so short-lived that they tend to get called
"lad" unless they're obviously elderly (which unfortunately doesn't exist in
EQ).  In those cases, the term "man" comes into use.

Halflings and Gnomes are short and relatively weak, so they also get called
"lad".  Occasionally it gets through the Dwarf's head that the Halfling or
Gnome is actually an adult, in which case "man" again comes into use.

(Sure, it's odd that a 4' Dwarf calls an 8' Ogre "lad".  You gonna point
this out to the person holding a battle axe at the level of your gonads?)

Dwarven Male calls Other Females:

Dwarves are polite.  It's always more flattering to call a woman "lass",
implying that she's a teenager.

Dwarven Female calls Dwarven Males:

See DM / DM.

Dwarven Female calls Dwarven Females:

"Cousin", unless she hasn't yet grown her beard, in which case she's "lass",
or she's obviously incompetent, which brings us back to the "unprintable"
category.

Dwarven Female calls Other Males:

See DM / OM.

Dwarven Female calls Other Females:

"Lass", unless she's obviously incompetent, which puts us into "unprintable"
.
