Sounds lovely, clearly I must make it my new home!  Well, for a little
while anyway, there aren't as many toys I'd like from the Guk vendors
as others.

I disagree, sort of.  To me the most fun thing in a game is overcoming
a substantial obstacle.  LDoN "normal" missions offer no obstacles to
success.  In fact, success is so routine that I'm wondering how you
would propose to distinguish "camping" LDoN for upgrades from, say,
camping for VT key drops?  Sure, you get to have a few more scenery
and mob model options, but really is it meaningfully different?  (I
shoulda asked Hippie Ramone that one, heh).
