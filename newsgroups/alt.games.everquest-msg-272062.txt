Well the latest patch has made it even more difficult to solo mob groups. 
This coupled with the fact that it's very rare that a solo creature will 
drop a chest makes it very difficult to improve your character at higher 
levels.

Also the lack of solo quests at higher levels also forces people to group as 
there's no other way of ganing experience.

I'm not asking for them to be made easier, though I think it's taking the 
piss that they made them harder. I'm simply asking for more solo quests that 
can be completed on your own. There are way to many quests that are supposed 
to be solo yet it turns out are impossible to complete on your own.
