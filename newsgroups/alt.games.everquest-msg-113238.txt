I think Lokari hit the nail on the head. The fact that I *can* SoW you
does not entitle you to it. I need no reason whatsoever to elect *not*
to SoW at any given time, though you can bet I have one if I refuse.
"What might that reason be?" you might ask. None of your business.
It's irrelevent anyway. I don't have to explain myself. You're in the
wrong for assuming I'm just being an ass for not buffing you.

I don't recall reading anyplace in the strategy guide, "The advantage
of selecting any non-druid and non-shaman class is that you get the
added benefit of their SoW and buff spells while playing a class with
none of their weaknesses..." or anything of the like.

People need to stop whining about other classes not there for their
benefit. How about this, druids and shammies hate to have their
conversations interrupted all the time by SoW requests.
