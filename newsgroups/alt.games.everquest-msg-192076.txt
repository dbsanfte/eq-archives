Be very careful of faction issues here... As an evil human SK, you may be
KOS to the cats in Erud's Crossing, which would make it darn near impossible
to hunt here. Also, you may not be able to turn in GLS's to the NK gypsies:
you might have to try turning them in to the Dark Elves in SRo instead.

Warrens is a very lucrative spot to hunt, and gets you faction with Heretics,
too. The only downside here is your pet. Because SK pet is *so* much lower
level than you, you're likely to find that you will get tons of green adds
solely because of pet. You could be better off getting a partner or even
soloing without pet.
