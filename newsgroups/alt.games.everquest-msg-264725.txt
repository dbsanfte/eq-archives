I would prefer this as well. The monsters should be attempting to
regroup and take back the area, not just pacing back and forth like
nothing is going on.

When I first saw the monsters outside the west gate of Freeport, I
thought they were patrolling the area. Nope, it was more like the
targets in an old style arcade. The only ones who actually reacted
to the player characters' presence were the deathfist orcs and
sometimes a decaying skeleton would get involved.

It might result in more shouts of 'run away ! run away' but it would
be interesting.
