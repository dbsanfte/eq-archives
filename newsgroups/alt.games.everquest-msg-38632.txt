My friends and I are having to order it from the States as the it won't be
released here for 2 or 3 months after the US release date.
I do like the way the PvP sounds and the fact you seem to work for your
country rather than your guild (lets hope it works that way, at least, as I
hear the FoH are on the Beta test for it)
Not intending on cancelling my EQ account yet (if at all) DAoC has a lot to
live up to and although my interest in EQ is waning I don't intend on
replacing it with another MMORPG unless it can capture the magic that EQ did
(and did well enough to drag this Quake head away from his clan practices)
Certainly not dropping EQ until long after Luclin has been released.

As for Everquest 2 (as mentioned in the report about Sony getting Hacked) a
contigency plan incase one of the upstarts gets it right?

I play two games, Q3 and EQ. Before EQ it was one, after EQ, it may very
well again be one.
