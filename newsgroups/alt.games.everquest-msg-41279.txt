Bizbee, this is the first time I've ever told you this. Even when
we've disagreed: Shut the fuck up. This topic is relevant to everyone,
it effects entire lives. This is more than just a place to discuss EQ,
it is a community, and a community turns to each other for support
when they're touched by a tragedy. How many can you think of that
compare to what happened today?

Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I 
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either. Leave me the hell alone.
