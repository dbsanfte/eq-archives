(2) should be modified somewhat, depending on the Warrior's level, MR,
and current HP it might be wiser to pull Basilisks rather than killing
them in place, they proc a long lasting Stun that could get you killed
if an HG wanders by at a bad time, and
(6) at times it could save mana to have the Warrior beat down HGs that
had gone snare dumb (i.e. were motionlessly trying to flee due to low
health).
