  Downgrading DX isn't an option, you NEED DX 8.1 to even run EQ.

  Your system doesn't meet the game's system requirements:

  It says a Pentium II 400 mhz is the minimum, and a 333 mhz Celeron
unfortunately falls below that.

  I'm not sure why all the sudden your system would fail to cut it (unless
it happened after a patch).

  Make sure you don't have stuff running in the background, especially virus
scanners and the like.  Good luck.
