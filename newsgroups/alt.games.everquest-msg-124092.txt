HaHaHAHAHA, if anybody actually read the quest NPCs at level 1 I wouldn't
have to tell level 20 vah shir about the citizen quest, much less about the
rest of the class specific quest they should have done at level 2.  My gawd,
you can get level 2 on just that first quest,then go around the town picking
up bags from NPCs for free, all without whacking on one single creature or
spending one cp.
