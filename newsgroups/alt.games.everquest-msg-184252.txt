My best suggestion is to make sure you only "hit" one of those mobs in
the pack and always have him targetted so you can reapply the charm if
it breaks.  Also, make sure the pack is close to each other.  If you
run around in a circle a few times that should get the pack nice and
tight.  For example, with Frost Giants.  I'll pick one and slap a DoT
on him to get the aggro.  Then I just run around with him following me
until I pick up other giants.  Then I charm the original one and have
him fight the others.  About 95% of the time they all will attack my
pet.  I've have found that if I had more than 10 mobs on my tail there
is one or two that keep chasing me.  I'm probably goofing up
somewhere.  What I usually do is run around my pet and the adds
attacking him and keep and eye out on my pet's health.  When that gets
low then I break the charm and DoT him to death.

The toughest mobs to swarm kite (for me) are Hill Giants in Rathe Mtns
because for some reason as soon as one giant is charmed they just
start to run away.  The last time I swarm kited those giants I had two
running after me while the other two were beating on my pet.  I did
manage to get all 5 killed after 15 minutes or so and walked away with
130pp.  :o)
