Well this one isn't nearly as bad. Frankly I don't think selling
characters (or buying them) is bad at all. It's a completely different
dynamic from buying pp and items; a sold item was something that could
have gone to someone else fairly, and sold pp is like robbing the bank
in monopoly, but a sold character doesn't change anything but the
person behind the monitor playing it.

Now I get annoyed when someone who has been collecting raid loot goes
and sells, but not much you can do about that except choose who you
bring to raids more carefully.

 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
