Ok there was a war announcement last night On Quellious... in EC and
WFP...   General soandso for the evils was recruiting in EC and Knight
Truheart was recruiting in WFP....

beyond the knight and general shouting in thier respective zones  JOIN
THE FIGHT AGAINST the opposite....
no one knew what to do... someone shouted you needed to hail the
knigght to join his side... you shoudl have seen the HAIL SPAM...

then someone in WFP shouts the General is in zone...

LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG LAG....  think of 254 people in WFP.

I could hardly move...  tick.... frame.... tick frame.... tick frame..
I tried to cast sow on myself... spell went... and I could move
around, no icon showed up.. I couldnt sit because I was still casting?
for 4 min... then I get spell interupted LOL...

I did a feedback after this... suggesting that the GM's in charge
should be a little more specific on what to do when they shout to the
zone JOIN ME>..... i mean WTF?!?!?  thats all he ever said.. oh yeah..
he also said ... Defend the Gates....

The general and knight Despawned....  I tried to zone into NFP... went
LD... and my wife on the other computer told me Freeport just crashed.
