That's awesome.  I'm guessing this was a GM thing?

My day yesterday was good but not quite this good.  I had gotten my bard up
to 8 and I've been wandering around exploring.  I started in kelethin and
got a free port from a very cool druid to surefall.  Wandered around there
and out to highpass and on to freeport.  Soulbinders are also very cool.
Anyway, in east commons, I got a high quality bear pelt.

I got bored there and went to misty thicket.  I saw an orc centaurian (light
blue) wandering around and waxed him.  He dropped a (I think this is right)
ringbearer's chainmail coif.  Anyway it was something like that.  I was
burdened and went into rivervale and sold my stuff.  I got 27pp 5gp for the
coif.

With the other stuff I had 30pp.  I went to the bank to deposit in my
otherwise empty account (I had bought a mandolin, axe and spells in
freeport).  At the bank I remembered the bear pelt and I had some other
pelts, too, so I did an auction.  A guy named Skyfyre said he wanted the hq
bear skin.  I asked how much.  He said I decide.  20pp? He said it was a
good deal and bought it.

I now had 50pp, 1gp and some silver.  I wanted a magic weapon so I went to
EC.  I auctioned that I wanted to buy a magic weapon with stats better than
my axe and I had 50pp.  I got a lot of tells.  One guy, I forget his name,
another cool player, said he had an iceclaw, stats are like 9 26 or
something.  He'd let me have it for 150pp.  I told him I only had 50pp.  He
asked if I had anymore in the bank. Nope, I didn't.  What the hell he said,
it's easter.  Come get it for 50pp.

After I bought it, one of the people I had been telling back and forth with
asked me if I had anything specific in mind.  I told him I had just bought
an iceclaw.  He asked how much I paid, I said 50pp.  He wrote back, wow,
can't beat that.

All in all, a good day.

Lewis
