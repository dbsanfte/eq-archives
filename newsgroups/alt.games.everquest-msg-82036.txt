There has been an interesting thread on some of the EQ message boards
from someone with the name "Bahter".  He's had that name for
approximately two years.

He's been using alternate advancement points, and became "Baron
Bahter".  No problem.  However, soon he will become "Master Bahter".
He was contacted by a GM and informed that "Master Bahter" violates
that name policy, and told that he will have to undergo a name change
when he reaches that title.  When he then uses enough AA points to get
past the "Master" title, they said he can have his name changed back
to "Bahter".

Some people have suggested not spending any more AA points until he
has enough saved up to go right past the "Master" phase.  That seems
the best solution for people who don't want to have to play
temporarily under a new name.

Anyway, if you've got a name that, when combined with the new titles,
might violate the naming policy, you might want to consider carefully
your AA spending plan.
