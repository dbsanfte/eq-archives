that's totally not a dual-core issue, per se - unless the act of replacing 
the cpu, as mentioned in mark's post (above), caused physical issues (like 
heat)

i second his ideas about drivers / os ...


and out of curiousity, what made you pick the 4400? the 4600 is the top in 
that line and the 4200 has the best price:performance ratio ... i'm just 
being anal =)
