I'm stll stuck with Win98SE for the time being.  I wasn't going to
increase the ram until I do an OS upgrade as well.  Anything more than
512MB makes it behave wonky in my experience.

As for video, I know it's close to end of life.  However it should
make do until the new year.  One of the recent interview regardig EQ2
siad that the Nvidia 6800 was only able to play the game at the 2nd
highest setting, so there is some room for growth.  I'll see what the
new year brings.
