>You don't have to be anywhere near a trap to raise sense traps and disarm
>traps. Just hotkey them. They go up without an actual trap present.


true... But when using disarm when no trap is present, you have to wait for
the box to become "ungreyed"  I know you can attach sense and disarm to
other keys or hotkey slots so that is not a big issue.  For the fastest
skillups in disarm, go find a trap.  The axe in SolA is one of the safest.
Go near it and click on it over and over as fast as your little fingers will
fly.   The attempts scroll by in a blur and before you know it, you are
maxed.
