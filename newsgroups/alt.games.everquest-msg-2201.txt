You can say something smart or something stupid but if you're an asshole
expect to be flamed.

If you say something stupid and claim that you're right, by god, and that
there's no possible way you could simply be ignorant, expect to be flamed.

Sure, some of the flames may have been uncalled for, but the comments you
are making fit into the "pointless" category.  Flames are bad?  So?  By
saying it do you really think Usenet is going to change? :)
