    They can try. But then they're limited by communications. One monk can
explain to another until he's blue in the face about the pathing in a given
area, but until the junior monk sees what's happening he's unlikely to
understand it or to be able to apply that lesson anywhere else. I see the
same thing in healing. I KNOW when a heal will get me summoned, and when it
will not. I reach for DA as soon as I start casting a summonable heal. But
if you asked me how I know, I couldn't say. I couldn't tell you "if you wait
for exactly X seconds, you will be all right" or anything of the sort
because I have no such rules that I follow. I just watch the fight, and
instinctively KNOW when I won't be creamed. So how could I teach that to
another cleric in a guide?

    And that still doesn't deal with the issue I brought up in my first
post, that many things just aren't taught. Let's use, as an example, running
to Ran from one of the goblin rooms below High Keep in the event of a train.
Important life skill if you hunt there. I have yet to see anyone list
exactly where you can gain a half second on the goblins when running by
crossing certain pathing lines as you run, to make the goblins take a longer
path to get to you. I know them. I was never caught by a train there,
because I knew where to run on the way up. I learned by watching how the
goblins ran after people that got aggro, including myself.

    Guides are exactly that - guides to what to do. They aren't complete
solutions. I've seen guilds on my server get "spoilers" to encounters, and
still get creamed repeatedly because there were little details that they
didn't know about. Like the guild that lost an Emperor fight because of a
chain of failures started by a single cleric clicking on someone when
picking up a mod rod and not getting back to the tank on time. They didn't
know to set up a proper mod area for the clerics, with no competition for
rods and no people blocking access, and they hadn't thought of contingency
plans for a cleric if he loses target because they had never done this sort
of thing before and didn't know those would be issues. They never did figure
that part out, because they didn't beat the encounter until after mods were
altered to be no drop. All they did was whine about how stupid it was that a
30 minute encounter could be blown by one stupid mistake.

> You're still full of bullshit...

    Considering this was my first post on this topic, how do you get "still"
full of BS? You seem to be trying so hard to pull this one out of the fire
that you're losing track of who is who!
