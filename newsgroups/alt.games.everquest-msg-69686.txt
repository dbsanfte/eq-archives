Definitely not going to argue with you about DX8.1.

But as I said in my 1st post.
Nothing else has a problem. Rock-solid, However none of the other games I
play require DX8.1 :) so very likely you have a winner there.
XP itself runs perfectly.
Anyhow I had no choice, poor old 98 wouldn't recognise my raid drive.

Mind you, I have a friend that's running XP with a geforce 2 GTS (not the
Titanium that I have) and he has very few probs.
