It is tested, of course they cannot spend a year on testing, so it's given
to test server, tried on there.  I think considering the antiquity of the
code, and the bulk of it, in generally they do a good job.

Major problems are in general, fixed quickly, which is great for an old game
like this.

I'd love for every patch to go off without a hitch, but that would require a
perfect world ;p

always been useless...all it needs is to have one link at the top saying
'login server up / down'
