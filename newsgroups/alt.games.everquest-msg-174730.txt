Only a couple.  The majority are people playing new twinks.

I honestly don't know if numbers are going down, but my feeling is that
they're at the most staying stagnant - the number of new people coming is
the same as the number of veterans leaving.

I know that if I were new to the MMORPG universe, I'd be waiting for
something like SWG rather than playing old games like UO or EQ.

This is all pure supposition on my part and is not based on anything like
actual evidence.
