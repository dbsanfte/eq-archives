so where is a good place for a 31 chanter to hunt? Loio was good fun in the
fort with all the adds, agree there totally. Moved on to FM, but giants cant
be mezed ( bah ) , although charming them can be a laugh, especially being a
Gnome <)

Was gonna try out OT, but if theres no adds there then wheres the challenge!

So any suggestion wellcome plz.

Cheers
