OK first things first. As an enchanter you CAN solo, though it is slow,
difficult and boring.

You are also pretty underappreciated before you get breeze and quickness.

Many of the lower (1-10) just do not how how an enchanter works so you need
to be a bit harsh sometimes if the mezz message (youll understand if you
play one) isn't getting through. nows the time to teach all those tanks how
to use /assist . youll be surprised how many lev15-17 ive met that have
never heard of assist yet the enchanter relies on the group using this
effectively.

If you want fast solo progress create a druid. If you want an involved,
difficult to learn class then the chanter is for you

Sorry if im rambling but had no sleep last night
