	Nope.  Not better than anything you don't need a raid to get, if you are
using decent arrows.

	I carried a Huntsman for Trueshot work, but that has come to an end; at
level 60 I outdamage Trueshot with melee even on raid mobs, at least until I
have AM.  I banked the Underfoot for the Wind Saber.  With summoned arrows,
the Wind Saber has a better ratio (.727) than the Underfoot (.600), and nearly
the same as the Huntsman (.766) and has stats and saves.  (The proc on the
Huntsman is worthless; proc rate is abysmal.)

	If you are using acrylia arrows you can get a slightly higher ratio from
the best of the DN bows, but you lose the stat bonuses and saves on the Wind
Saber, and the DN bows are much slower.  Acrylia arrows and a Thunderbolt will
blow the freaking doors off anything from DN.  The best DN bow is 30/37 range
130; Thunderbolt is 30/38 range 250, +5 STR/DEX/AGI/WIS, +50 HP/mana, +10
fire/cold/magic.  Both bows will have practically the same ratio with acrylia
(or mithril) arrows, only the latter shoots 120 feet further and has great
stats and saves on it.  Hmm, gee, let me think.
