Sorry for piggy-backing off this post, David's
hasn't propagated yet.

If anything is out of context, I'm sure he will
let me know.

I think there is an unbroken line stretching from
those days, and even before, right up till the
present day. Artists are still commissioned, and
are still expected to produce high quality work. 

The commisioners may no longer be predominantly
church and state dignitaries, but the song remains
the same.

The results of such commissions have always been
variable... who knows what Rembrandt or Leonardo
threw in the bin.

What 'quality' are you referring to?

After all, commerciality is a quality.

I think you might have a hard time classifying the
artistic quality of music into an hierachical
structure, e.g. is Led Zeppelin better than Robert
Johnson, artistically?

I know its fashionable to accept the cynical view
that Paul Weller wrote of;

"And the public wants what the public gets", 

but think of how, over the years, the music
corporations have been forced to accept, that
which the public wants, despite the preferences of
the recording industry. 

Musicians will always make music, most of them
whether they make money or not. That is their job.
Starving them might make the biography notes on
the album seem a little more romantic, but it
won't make their music better.,

Corporations will make money. That is their job.
If you are a musician, you want the best one you
can find.

I'm surprised that, as a fellow socialist, you
haven't put forward the idea that artists should
be paid from the public purse. An idea I'm
certainly in favour of. Maybe get rid of a few
economists and petty nobles, and put their
salaries to good use.

I agree they make lousy artists.
