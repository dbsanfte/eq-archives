Well, I know I've had dozens of "Dagger of Dropping"'s from gnolls in SK.
This is a magic dager 3/21 or so and procs weaken.
Gave a bunch to a lvl 15 friend to sell/give out in EC. But most players
won't bother taking this thing along. It sells for 2 to 3 gp at vendors, and
go for 2-5pp to players.
If you really want one you could go to SK and do a "/auc WTB dagger of
dropping 2pp". You're bound to get someone to give you tell. Or in the worst
case get it at the NK bridge vendor, SK Centaur vendor or SK Aviak vendor.
Most players in SK sell to one of these and Daggers are pretty common in
stock.

Second lowest, on the Vazaelle server, are the velium weapons going for as
low as 6pp up to 10pp and 15pp for 2h swords.

The third lowest I have seen is the Runed Totem Staff, dropped by lvl 18
gnolls in Lake Rathe. The RTS tends to sell for 10-15pp and is a magic 2hb
9/xx with +5hp and +5mana. It's Lore and pretty heavy so don't expect many
sales for these.
