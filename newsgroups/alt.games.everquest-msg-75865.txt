Congratulations, genius. Not only do you know nothing about databases,
you've now also demonstrated your basic ineptitude with the relatively
simple task of posting to Usenet. Sanjian was answering my comment.
I'm the one that said you don't know shit about databases

Have fun with your "clients" and their "databases." When they insist
on calling themselves your "managers" and the tools you're working
with your "french fry maker," you just nod knowingly and remember that
you're a "database consultant" and not a "minimum wage burger
flipper."
