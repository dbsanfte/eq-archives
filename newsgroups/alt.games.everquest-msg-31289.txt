Naduah looks up from her reading...

...The name CLEARLY violates the naming policy that we all read every time
we log in.  You know, the EULA?  Go to Everquests home site and read the
naming policy.  His name forms a phrase, so its a bad name.  If it wouldn't
have been Lokari that caught it I'm sure someone else would have eventually.
He also was a nice guy and told the person that he reported his name.  I'm
sure that is more than most of us do if we see something like that.  He
could have just went on his merry way and waited for the idiot to get a name
change.

My 2cp worth, I'll go back to my corner and read again.
