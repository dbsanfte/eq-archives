Since you are a rogue, you should insist on the necro 97%
rez.  After all, you are exping up so fast soloing as a rogue
that those two minutes worth of lowered stats are simply
impossible to ever recover from on your headlong flight
from 1 to 60 in a single week.

Better, get a friend in CS and insist on the CustServRez
which is good for 100% and no rez effects at all!  When
anyone complains, point out that you are a rogue, and
they will certainly back off.  Facing you, cause noone
turns their back on a rogue.  Not that there's anything
wrong with that.
