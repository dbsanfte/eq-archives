We actually joined Norrath's Valiant Alliance last night.  Seems like a 
nice bunch of people even though I couldn't understand a word they were 
saying (Human tongue is 8 now!)  Xari seems to really like 'em, and thinks 
you should all join up with them instead of starting a new guild :P  I 
don't have any particular allegance to 'em one way or another (well, they 
did teach me elvish) and would be happy to join an AGE guild.
