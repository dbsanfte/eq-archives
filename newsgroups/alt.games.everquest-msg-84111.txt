this is another stupid idea i had.....
we all have a home town and when we leave we venture out and  become what we
want to be.then most likely 5 to 10th level we come back "home".  with the
idea of having a zone for homes only(refer to the many posts about having
houses).would it be a nice idea to have parents[they would be npc
toons]?they would be only in the "residential"zone and a home would have
several "kids" so there could be another level of social reaction{right now
its /group  /guild} with this it would allow another /family from level 1 to
60 .you would be assigned a family when you create your toon.so now when you
as a level 8 toon go back to your town you would be able to visit your toons
actual parent.and in turn hear from your "brothers" and "sisters" they
helping you and you in turn helping them.this like a guild helping you
through out your "life"..but that is just my idea what do you think?
