A long long time ago, when the bazaar was first in, and you had to eat (well
you didn't have to, but I was selling food), I had 'to eat' food and drink
in my inventory, and since my inventory had 8 trader's satchels, I had it in
trader's satchels. (fish rolls and the hair tonic (name escapes me)).

Went ahead and put them for sale, 50pp each.

imagine my surprise when I come home to find my monk munching through misty
thicket picnics and drinking tea, cause someone bought out my stock of fish
rolls and tonics. The guy even sent me a tell laughing about how I would eat
all my picnics (I kept tells in a separate window).

I felt it was a fair exchange (he was trying to grief me, and I had eaten 2
picnics, drank 1 tea, he bought 18  fish rolls and 29 tonics). Had the guy
made a fuss later I would have refunded his plat, minus the (reasonable)
replacement cost of what he bought and what he made me consume in more
expensive food.

But this guy is a rat bastard. He'd be out or I would. (actually, he'd be
out... I'm an officer.. well was an officer when I played, and my GL would
back me if I punted someone from the guild I'm sure, due to seniority and
the fact that I have a lot of respect in the guild as a  generally fair,
knowledgeable and straight up kind of guy)
