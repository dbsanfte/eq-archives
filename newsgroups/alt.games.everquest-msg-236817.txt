Ummm...it's not that folks don't think the universe is splendid and
wonderful, but that there's no logical connection between "amazing
universe" and "must have been made by someone".  And for that matter, if
some guy who could make fish talk and whatnot came along and told me he
made the universe I"d be like "ok, talking fish are great, but that don't
mean you can make a universe. But that's ok dude, you don't have to prove
it to me.  Just like I don't have to believe you are more than
the man who can make fish talk.  Peanut?"

Cuz I have no trouble wrapping my mind around the concept that amazing
things can just..happen. Doesn't make them less amazing because some power
didna will it into being.
