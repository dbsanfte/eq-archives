    At level 51 I've been in a chealing group...... *once* and I was the one
being chealed. (yup, you guessed it, I turned up with agro and explained
that to the cleric. That group was bery happy with me for both pulling and
tanking.)

    For god's sake look around at some of the other things in "the game"
there's more to it than chealing grind groups, or I've been levelling on
vita brits?

    The groups that stick to the tank/heal cycle bore the utter fuck out of
me. I was in a beautiful group the other night in cobalt scar, no cleric,
pally was main healer (with his uber 300 point heal). This one time (at band
camp), the ranger accidentally pulled 4 wyverns at once. Everyone thought we
were dead, but he kited them all over the shop, and one by one I'd land a
snare then the pally would root and then the wizzy would start nuking. Then
we'd rush in an melee :) Was awesome, no casualties and I could almost hear
the soloing druid watching us go "hahaha they're deadmeat...... woah cool
they got it under control!".

    Equal most fun i've had in 20 levels :)

    If the game ever turned into a one-tactic grind, I'd quite in 5 seconds.
I can get more enjoyment out of tetris. And yeah, you can have my stuff.
Even the goranga idol.
