No, the week PoP was out we had a break mostly from raids, but I was on
vacation then.
So when I came back, half the guild was 65, and raids were re-started.

Im 64 atm (1 yellow to 65), 140AA's, Shaman is 61 w/10AA's (didn't buy PoP
for any of my other accounts yet)

PoV is a kinda hard place... not because the mobs are too tough, but because
its Karnors 2.0.

I grouped the other night, and the cleric died twice during the meet-up,
during buffing, and then twice during the killing, all from trains.  We had
so many stoppages and downtime, I'd have made 3x the exp if I were still
soloing.

But then on Sunday (that 20odd hour playing session) we had an awesome group
going, no deaths, constant pulls and kills, and the exp was really sick.

The stuff I "solo" on gives 1% exp per kill, hits for 500 or so, and has
about 20k HP.. if only there were a PoP velks :)
