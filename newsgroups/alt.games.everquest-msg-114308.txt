You asked, I answered. I have a low tolerance for people who will slam
others based on wildly ignorant assumptions. Comes from having worked
tech support for DirecTV.

Customer: Duh, my screen went snowy! They must have cust my services
just to piss me off even though I paid everything!

Nevermind that before they ever had services when they hooked the
system up they didn't have a snowy screen when they turned it on. I
spent an hour on the phone with some lady explaining to her that the
screen kept going snowy because she kept turning the bloody TV off of
channel 3. She was going on and on about how it was all because of
shabby equipment and how sad it was that a multi-million dollar
company couldn't make better equipment and how DTV was ripping off
their customers (Nevermind that DTV doesn't even MAKE the equipment).

I spent 8 hours a day taking calls, at least 75% of which were that
bad, if not worse. People don't read the manual, people don't read the
instructions on the screen, people don't use common sense... Nope,
it's crappy equipment! The evil corperation is ripping us off!

I think anyone who has ever worked tech support and isn't touchy about
things like this deserve a medal...and need to be locked up for
research to find out what alien powers they have to put up with it.
