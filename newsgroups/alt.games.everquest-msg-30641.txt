First of all, get that "template" word out of your head.  It's a dirty word
in AC and it doesn't exist in EQ.  You choose a class, you don't construct a
template.  There are certain standards, like "a warrior needs a Strength of
__ to be successful" but you don't get the same flexibility of choice as in
AC.

The obvious choice for a powerful warrior is an Ogre Warrior.  They're big
and brutish.  Stupid, too, but that doesn't matter.  Strength, Stamina, and
Dexterity are probably your stats of choice.
