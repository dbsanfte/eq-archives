   The new patch 3.0 will come out at the middle of October. Many
hunters players are now playing on beta realms. They have tested the
new talents and skills. Read this tip:
=93Aspect Mastery is nerfed! Lock and Load has been gutted! Did you see
what they did to Expose Weakness! Cats got kneecapped! Too many pets!
Sporebats don't suck? Where'd the crit go! Rogues can avoid Flares?!
Haste is a Lie! A damn lie, I say!=94
Tho this voice is only from a single player, we can look at the new
talents of other characters. Too much buffered. There has a vedio in
Youtobe, a rogue beated down a warrior in 3 shoots!
However, the new talents and skills are still in beta, hope we can get
some buffed soon.
