I haven't camped the idol yet (though it's on my list of "to do's") but
I have had a dagger with stats that fits in the range slot. I was
advised by a couple guildies who'd had similar to make sure I didn't
even have range attack set up in my hot keys, because it did indeed
launch, and you couldn't recover it afterward. It just gets "eaten" like
shooting an arrow that misses.

All in all, given the value of the idol, I would advise making sure you
don't have Range Attack hotkeyed or available in battle while using it,
unless you're a class that really lives and dies by your range
attack.(Does that really apply to anybody but rangers or monks trying
for a crit hit?) I only use range (either arrows or throwing stars,
etc.) for pulling anyway, so it's tucked well away from the main bank of
keys.
