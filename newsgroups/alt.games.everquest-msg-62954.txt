I can zone in to CC.

Once.

Attempting to zone in again without a full reboot of the computer,
however, hangs me.

This is similar to the problem I have with GD, which I solved by
turning the clipping plane way down before zoning in (can turn it
right back up again afterwards). This doesn't work with CC, however,
and doesn't happen in any other zone.

I have deleted and redownloaded the CC (and GD for that matter) files
from the patcher, no help.

Anyone seen this before? More importantly, anyone seen this and FIX it
before? Though I only go to CC for bricks of velium it is still fairly
annoying.
