Wow - this was a sudden development. Anyone else frightened on how
quickly this is coming out? Personally, this is the first ive heard of
it, a MONTH before its release (altho rumors of somthing began to
surface a few months ago). Everytime a patch would get botched, wed
all grumble about proper beta testing, exactly how much has this
expansion been tested?? Or are we going to pay to beta test it? Has
any of this code been on test server for any length of time? Who here
will be terrified to put any items in thier expanded bank capacity
until at least june?

Im curious about the new "cartography" system. Is this an admission to
ShowEQ in some form (ala EQW)? I sooooo hope its not some goofy
"radar" system like Asheron's Call. Imagine the whining coming from
druids and rangers over this. I can hear it now... "first PoP rendered
ports useless... now this.. I QUIT!!! (followed by of course, an
avalanch of CIHYS???)

Im actually kinda shocked they didnt include the windowing feature in
this expansion. We got a freebie there.
