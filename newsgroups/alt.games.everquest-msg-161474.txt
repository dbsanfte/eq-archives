Likely translation:  "I know that anyone with any brains must
agree with a liberal agenda, therefore anyone with a
conservative agenda must by definition be an idiot."

The one good thing I can say for that sort of arrogance
is that you've got plenty of company.

I'll bet that unlike some people he at least knows how to 
spell "know-nothing".

And gosh, there's that intellectually dishonest catch-22 
again:  "If he does something questionable, it proves he's
an idiot, and if he does something shrewd, it's just because
his handlers told him what to do, he's still an idiot."


>When was the last time you saw Bush responding to policy questions?

Yesterday's press conference.

Bitter much?

And I repeat, he answered a lot of policy questions at
yesterday's press conference, and answered them quite well.
If you'd pull your head out of James Carville's ass,
you might be able to keep up with current events and
learn to form your own informed opinions instead
of just swallowing the partisan spin.
