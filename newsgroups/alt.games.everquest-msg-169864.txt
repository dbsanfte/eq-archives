Some time ago, I had Realaudio installed on my pc.
(don't remember which version of RA)
I thought that RA was causing problems for EQ,
by doing things such as ...calling home, and in
the process, causing EQ to crash.
I removed RA because of that.
Has anything changed?
Is RA still causing problems?
Is RA still trying to spy on user's  computers?
Any comments welcome.
T.
