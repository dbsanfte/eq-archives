Centi longswords standard equipment for all starting fighter classes? Err -
they cost 2k.... Remember those people who <aren't> twinking? You cannot
design the entire game around twinking just because most established
characters do it. What about the real newbies, the ones without a spare
trivial 2K to pass down?

I do have a ranger (half elf) who is level 31 who is just now looking to get
his Short sword of Morin. He is still using two Velium Battleaxes and
wearing banded. His jewelly is still cutthroat rings and onyx earings. 2K is
just a pipedream to him as he has no-one to twink him on Xev.
