Beg is an inefficient taunt because few people ever develop the skill. I expect a
begging of 100 is much more effective a taunt than a begging of only 3.

On the hotkey panel with all my combat controls, I have both the standard beg ability
and a social labeled "Annoy", which is (if memory serves... I wrote this a long time
ago)

/autoattack off
/doability 8
/autoattack on

If you try to beg while attacking, you get a "You can't do that while fighting!" kind
of message. The /doability number should be the hotkey slot where you have Beg. When
Beg resets, press Annoy again. Just be very careful and don't Annoy guards when you
only mean to Beg :-P
