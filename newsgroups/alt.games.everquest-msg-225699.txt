I thought the raid leader made a number of decisions that were probably less
than optimal from the standpoint of efficiency, but were probably the best
call to make from the standpoint of overall raid safety. In other words, he
was overly cautious, but never to a fault imo. He did, after all, succeed in
his mission to lead us to victory!

Are you suggesting that casting the Malosixxx line does *not* increase hate?
I'm not denying it, but I haven't been able to find any data on this point
and I don't have enough experience with it to judge yet. I don't usually
have enough time to use a Malosixxx in front of a Slow. Heck, I often don't
Slow because the kills are over so quickly. I figure that once I start
playing in the Planes, however, where mobs hit harder and last longer, this
will change. At that point I expect I'm going to rely a lot more on
Malosixxx. But I would have assumed that casting the debuff was going to
raise hate just like casting Slows does ...
