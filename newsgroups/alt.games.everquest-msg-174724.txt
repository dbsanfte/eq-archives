    It was explained to me like this: the entire guild has to get flagged
for this eventually, so it's DKP-neutral. This is just a way to separate the
people who don't want to do the Carprin event again or who can't because of
time constraints from those who will and do.

    Considering the person who said this is in a guild that is fanatical
about DKPs, I'd take it with a grain of salt. Once we helped flag some of
their people on Aerin'Dar, as part of our server flag-sharing agreement.
Well, the people getting flagged asked their guild to make the kill a DKP
event, so they wouldn't fall behind others that had done Aerin'Dar with the
guild. Next thing we know, we have 50 people at our raid because it's a DKP
event and they all wanted points. We had 17 clerics for a tier 2 boss, lol.

    That's how it was done, same as the HoH trials. It also got clicked a
lot by dumb folk doing XP at the zone-in. ;-)

    One night, when trying for one specific named, the raid leaders decided
to try a new way of spawning him: they'd keep all the green skeleton guys
they could find in camp, alive, and see if that helped. Well, guess what
cleric got heal aggro and was told to offtank them for the entire night?
Imagine two solid hours of being beaten on by annoying green skeletons while
trying to keep the other people in your group alive. When the raid leaders
finally decided that wasn't working, just kill them, I got the killshot on
all of them. Almost like I'd been waiting to kill them all night!

    I knew I'd forgotten a detail! Yeah, you need the pre-flag from the guy
in PoTranq, but you can't get that until you kill Bertox and get the flag
from the diseased guy in PoTranq.

    You're fine. Kill Bertox, get flag from diseased guy in PoTranq, get
pre-flag for Tylis in PoTranq, go do Tylis event. If you have any problems,
do an "unlock memories" with the Seer in PoK.

    You say you're at 4200 mana and FT 12. You're within a couple hundred
mana of me, and at or above my FT. Were you catching med when you could?
Yaulping? Were necromancers available for feed?

    Bah, I don't even have an extended range item. I always wanted a
Starfall Bracer, too (or, hope hope, Aten bracer).

    You won't see someone like that for a long, long time. We haven't yet.
