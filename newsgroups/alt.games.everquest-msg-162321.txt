Well, thats what I meant.  Each of the new spell levels.  Since post 50 all
of that changes I just didn't go into detail.  There is also another pet at
level 55.

Yes my pet does too, and takes a lot less damage as well.  Sometimes I
finish it off, sometimes I run.  If pup dies it usually means things are not
going well, but sometimes the MOB is pretty low, in which case I finish him
and then retreat to lick my wounds and summon a new pet.

Agreed, just wanted to point out inaccuracies in the previous posters
statements that imply that shamans are not a pet class and that druids are
better soloers.  It all depends on the situation which class would have the
advantage.  Probably in the long run druids can get faster exp because they
can mulit-kite, but anyone that implies that shamans are a poor soloing
class is simply incorrect.
