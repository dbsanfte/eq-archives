I also started making poison and totally agree with you it is a skill
burning money to train it.

I start in SRO and making ASP poison. I found the cost is low and the dd is
nice. However, making and applying those did not train up my skill. Will try
to make some madness poison in OT but that require lined vial. However, my
skill in pottery only allow me to make regular vial only.

Regarding weapon, the SCH is too common, and I think it is more to the
shaman side rather than the rogue side. I am trying to find other option.

Last, I make good money in Lower GUk as I pick up FS weapons there and sell
in the ogre/troll city with DE illusion. yes, it consume time, but I saved
quite good fortune there and you may also try this.
