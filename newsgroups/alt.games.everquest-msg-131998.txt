}I have gotten hold of the Blackburrow Brewers cask, I have read that it has
}some value to rogues - what should I do with it / charge for it?
}My warrior is constantly poor - any ideas for earning pp?

These two questions go so well together. :) It is, as someone said, for a 
rogue quest.  Many a rogue would be delighted to part with 50-100pp for 
it.  Better still, they may be persuaded to trade some goofy warrior 
gear they have taking up bank space for it. :)
