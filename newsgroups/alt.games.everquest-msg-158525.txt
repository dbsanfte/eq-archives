DB has the same exact same function.  However, it takes longer and costs more to
cast, making it less useful in an emergency.  The HP regen is so low that it has
never managed to get me out of a "low HP aggro" condition even if I leave it up
the full 18 second duration.  If I had to pick one or the other, it would be DA
every time.  I mem DB in situations where I'm likely to use this function a lot,
and I cast DB whenever I can get away with it, since that leaves DA up and ready
for the real SNAFU where I literally don't have a DB worth of mana left, or am
so swarmed that I can't channel DB thru the mess.

It does not, as far as I know, last one second longer.  I could be wrong there,
of course, or perhaps its been changed.  95% of the time, when I cast a DA type
spell, I click it off before the full duration is over anyway.  Get it up, move
away from the mobs and give the tank time to aggro or the mezzer time to mez or
someone a chance to root... then click it off so I can cast.  Can't cast with it
up, you see, so essentially the group has no cleric.  I pretty much only leave
it full length if I'm not needed at all, or if I actually have to run to zone,
usually behind the rest  of my fleeing party, since I stayed and sucked it up
long enough to give them a head start, then hit DA before hot footing it myself.

I also have to caution you again, it doesn't drop all your aggro.  Just most of
it. You are still on the list.  If your HP is very low, you will be back on top
of the list the instant it drops.  If there are other people handling things and
they know what to do, and your HP is ok, you will be fine even after the DA
comes off, if your HP is ok.  If your HP is low, though, you have to know that
all unrooted, unmezed mobs are coming right for you.  Be ready with your next
step the instant DA drops (or you drop it)  Best solution is your fast heal, and
getting sufficient distance between you and the mobs to allow that heal to go
off.  Root or Flash of Light or Wave of Fear are other possibilities, even if
you have to mem them while DA is up.  Gate is way down on the bottom of the
list, for use only when wipe seems inevitable... and then don't ignore it, since
you are going to end up in your bind spot anyway, you will be more useful
dressed than naked.
