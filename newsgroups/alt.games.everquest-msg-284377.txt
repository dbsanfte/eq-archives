Everything I have ever read about bards indicates they have two
different kinds of haste, one which does not stack with spell haste and
one which does.  (Actually three--some stacking songs also give
overhaste, some don't)  Prelagor's link explained it:
"Types of Haste:

Permanent Item Haste (Flowing Black Silk Sash or FBSS)

Spell Haste (INCLUDES most Songs--Anthem de Arms, INCLUDES right
clickity items--Lute of the Howler, Procs--Dance of the Blade from
Singing Short Sword)

Bard Stacking Haste --No cap raiser (Er Vaj Line)

Bard Stacking Haste --Cap raiser(Vah Shir/Rizlona's Line)**possibly the
Ranger AA Guardian of the Forest? Don't know the %**"

The only thing I am not sure of is whether or not the monk haste "song"
stacks with spell haste.  (i.e. is it song v.2 or 3 or is it song v.1?)
