I have this problem with the Tower of Frozen Shadow in Iceclad, if I am
going to go LD anywhere while zoning it is here. Have noticed several
guildmates have the same problem. Have deleted files from that zone and it
doesn't fix the problem. I just live with it, am almost done there anyways
just equiping alts now.
