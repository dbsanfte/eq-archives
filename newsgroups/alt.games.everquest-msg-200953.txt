I read an article in PC Magazine recently that suggested it would not be
worth it.  They tested various amounts of memory and also different speeds
(DDR, DDR333, DDR400).  The speed of the memory made almost no difference
whatsoever, with the DDR400 actually performing some tasks slower than the
333.  The biggest difference was in the amount of memory, and the biggest
performance boost came from upgrading from 128 to 256.  I think there was
something like a 30 percent increase in certain apps (multimedia content
creation maybe).  The leap from 256 to 512 was more like 10 percent, and not
even that on some tasks.  The conclusion was pretty much that 512 is the max
that a desktop machine really needs, and even that much is overkill for all
but serious gaming machines.

With your setup, I would personally not recommend spending money on more
memory.  Also, if you run everything on high and have no problems, why do
you even need to consider it? :-)
