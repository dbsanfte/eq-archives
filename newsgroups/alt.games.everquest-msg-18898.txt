Magicians can have similar fun with Summon Monster.  Summon until you get
something that actually looks menacing.  (Might take a few tries, and
doesn't work in all zones.  In a few places you get something halfway scary
like a Minotaur, except it comes out two feet tall.)  Griffons, cyclops and
giants are best, since they tend to be "normal" sized.  Aviaks work well in
South Karana, since the bird-hunters there tend to be hypersensitive about
red-con birds.  I've had a lot of fun with Gnolls though.  They often show
up huge, and with the old white and red Splitpaw look.  I got one like
that, named Kaber, and left him parked in front of Black Burrow without
really considering what might happen.  I came back when I started hearing
rumors of some kind of GM event near Black Burrow.  I showed up to see what
looked like about two dozen newbies cowering in fear of Kaber, while a
small group of higher level players waited nearby to see what developed.  I
moved off, attacked a normal weakling gnoll, and moved behind the clump of
newbies.  Just about the time the more alert of them finished typing "Do
you need help?" Kaber noticed the gnoll trying to chew on me and ran to
rescue me.  The newbies thought he was finally attacking, and scattered
like leaves before a storm.  And the clump of high-levels just about fell
off the hill laughing.
