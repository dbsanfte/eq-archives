Indeed - although just to clarify, the FD fails in the spellcasters case
because the spell hits you once you have successfully feigned FD.

A better monk and I will be able to answer this one better:

This won't happen if you have fooled a mob of level 32 (?) or below.  That
is because a successful FD wipes the hate list of the mob completely,
so it won't care if someone heals you.  (I have had clerics heal me in
just this situation, and the mob just stood there before wandering off -
I was just about to shout at the cleric to stop too ;) )

On mobs above this level, there is only a _chance_ that you will be
removed from their hate list.  The mob will stop attacking you, but it
will have a much wider aggro range than normal should you decide to stand
up.... (Classic place to see this: Karnor's Keep with monks pulling across
the drawbridge and doing pop/drop stuff).

Along these lines, I imagine it is possible that if a cleric decides
to heal you at this point, the mob will get grouchy.

Tris.
