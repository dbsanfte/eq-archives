I did one at level 28 with my bard... quite a long time and quite a few dead
cyclops later, at the far end of the zone from the HG... did you know by
the way that the corrupted druids don't care for HGs?  anyway, the
big guy fell, dropped all of 8pp, and I shelved the HG slaying for several
more levels.  Killable, yes, but worth doing?  Only for the "wow" of it.
