I grabbed the first post off google with 'numbers' as an example. When 
you critiqued it I located a 2nd with more detail. It would be far more 
productive if you did your own search though, because that would 
demonstrate I'm not selecting for articles that agree with me. You'd see 
first hand that they *all* agree with me.

I'll grant that there is no doubt bias, a statistic without bias doesn't 
exist. But what strikes me as being telling is that there doesn't seem 
to actually be any *debate* as to its truth. The articles, all of them, 
   conclude the same thing.

I merely grabbed the first couple that seemed to have any real numbers. 
But I didn't have to pick and choose the articles, they all agreed.

There appear to be no counter studies by the pro-death groups that claim 
its cheaper. It appears the premise that 'capital cases cost more' is 
accepted as truth by everyone but people who rely exclusively on 
intuition that a single injection ought to be cheaper than feeding and 
guarding someone for 30-50 years.
