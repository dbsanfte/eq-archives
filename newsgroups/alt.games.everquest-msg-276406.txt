50 new disciplines? 45 of which will be barely worth the copper to buy 
:) Hell, the pre-50 ones -Now- for hybrids (resist, and fearless) are 
barely worth buying.

It comes up often with charm before a deliberate break. I also imagine 
'real pet classes' may want to tweak buffs for stacking conflicts from 
time to time, and with buff durations in the hours...

Its an improvement, but how much (and more importantly -which- bards 
will benefit) depends on how much itemization there is, and where it is. 
(e.g. DoN Raid only? or all the way up on one group bosses?)

not. =|

I wouldn't give SOE the satisfaction.

Its a nice move, but it proves the initial nerf was a mistake.
