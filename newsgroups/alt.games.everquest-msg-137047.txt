Heh, retard huh? Kinda like an enchanter who goes on a bitch fest 
because he didn't bother mezzing the mob the MT switched from? Retarded 
as the enchanter who didn't bother to AE mez the 12+ spiders we had on 
us? Retarded as the enchanter who didn't even bother to thank the cleric 
who ress'd his ass? Retarded as the enchanter with NO situational 
awareness whatsoever and who's only "fun" in the group was Garou'ing me 
after I REPEATEDLY told him not to because it strips Bi'Lah?? FOAD.. 
just another self-rightous crack monkey
