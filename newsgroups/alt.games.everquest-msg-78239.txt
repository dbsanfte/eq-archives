You know, I still remember when Arolpin posted that. I immediately stole
it and used it as a sig file for a while, and woulnd't you know it? I
was browsing an eq site on Friday and came across it in a list of EQ
quotes. Of course, in my file, I deleted "Lorespinner" as I'm pretty
sure he's dropped his surname since then.
