    Are they, now?

    Velium Gemmed Claws: 17/20, 80 HP/MANA/END, 30 points of resists, 30
points of stats. Has an extra aug slot for more stats.
    Fangs of Vyzh'dra: 17/19, 75 HP/100 MANA/END, 45 points of resists, 35
points of stats, and a proc that adds 5 DPS under optimal conditions.

    Velium Gemmed Dagger: 16/20, 80 HP/MANA/END, 30 points of resists, 30
points of stats. Has an extra aug slot for more stats.
    Khalshazar: 16/20, 125 HPs, backstab mod, 45 points of stats, a minus 10
hate per second proc.

    Velium Gemmed Long Sword: 16/20, 80 HP/MANA/END, 30 points of resists,
30 points of stats. Has an extra aug slot for more stats.
    Acrylia Handled Broadsword: 16/19, 100 HP/END, 45 points of resists, 46
points of stats, and a proc that adds 3.33 DPS/20 regen per tick under
optimal conditions.

    If you're clocking 100 DPS (made-up figure) with Velium Gemmed Claws,
you'd be getting 110 DPS with Fangs. The difference between the velium
gemmed dagger and Khalshazar, and the Acrylia Handled Broadsword and the
Velium Gemmed Longsword, is even smaller. Those are the top weapons from
Luclin - anything else is going to be worse in comparison. For example,
offhand the Claws will likely parse even to a Fist of Acrylia, the Dagger
will parse even to Bloodbath (including +ATK), the Longsword even to things
like Vyzh'dra's Render of Souls. Unless you're looking for a specific
feature of a weapon, like the added hate of Bloodfrenzy, why bother camping
this stuff?

    Depends on what you can afford to buy. Top-end would put you closer to
300 raw AC and under 2 K HP difference. I can appreciate the difference,
though, especially since the Bazaar stuff is mostly lacking in worn effects
(and what stuff you can get with worn effects doesn't have the AC/HPs).

    A group of people from my guild went on a Barindu raid recently with 12
others in Bazaar gear. The event was beaten with ease - my guildleader said
he'd seen them knock it over several times before without any "ringers"
along. 100 HP 15 ATK melee belt and 125 MANA FT 3 ranged item dropped. This
was a pickup raid, not a formal guild thing - the raid leader had to explain
everything to the people involved. There's lots of similar things out there,
like Paffa event in CoD or the Zek brothers in Tactics, which can be dropped
with about 18 people, don't require better than Bazaar gear, and drop 100
HP/MANA or better items which are No Drop (and thus aren't farmed by bored
ubers). The key is to find out about this stuff and organize.
