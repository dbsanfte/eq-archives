You're misreading what I said, no surprise. They influence the
outcome. The large number of "blind sheep" voters out there will
gravitate toward whatever candidate is leading in the polls. You also
have to remember that there is a large number of voters who vote
strictly party-line. "who cares what the individual candidate stands
for, he's a democrat/republican" (Incidently, those people are, in my
opinion, part of the reason our government is so fucked up)
