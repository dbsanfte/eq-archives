I was in the first open beta of Ryzom, and while it seemed interesting at
first because of the unusual setting, it turned out to be a levelling
treadmill of the worst kind. I.e. about the only interesting thing to do
was to gang up with some folks, smack a couple of monsters around and watch
your experience bar creep up slowly. Ok, the skill/magic customization
system was kind of innovative, until after some getting used to it it
turned out there's just a handful of useful combinations anyway, and it
kind of became a meta-game in which you had to try to figure out how to
best work around the latest bout of nerfing...
