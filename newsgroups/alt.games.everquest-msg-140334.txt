Every time he posts one of his cockamamie conclusions, just picture this
fish and all will be clear.

He thinks I'm his family gynecologist Dr. Morris harassing him on Usenet, so
be it. It's his paranoia and his prerogative. Now he thinks you and _TOM are
the same person ... great. More paranoia to make his life miserable.

He also thinks you were posting from all over the world. He only adds to his
unwilling comedy routine.

Do you see why I enjoy poking fun at this clown-fish?
