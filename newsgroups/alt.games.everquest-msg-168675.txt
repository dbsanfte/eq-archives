No sorry to disappoint you but here is the real speeds and
info for horses(most info from caster's realm) :

Speed and Prices

Type                        Speed                      Price Range
Rope Bridle Approx.         25% Movement Rate Increase 8,400pp to 12,300pp
Leather Bridle  Approx.     50% Movement Rate Increase 27,300pp to 41,000pp
Silken Bridle Approx.       60% Movement Rate Increase 60,900pp to 84,800pp
Chain Bridle  Approx.       70% Movement Rate Increase 95,600pp to 135,400pp
Ornate Chain Bridle Approx. 85% Movement Rate Increase Only drop off very high level NPC's
in Luclin.

A note on prices, the most expensive price represents a 40 charisma while
the lowest price represents a 110 charisma. 110 charisma is the best you
can have for the horse merchants, anything higher doesn't lower the prices
further. You can see how getting a high level charisma buff would be good
when buying a horse though.

Color

Colors don't matter other than for show.  Black and White
horses are the more popular colors over Brown and Tan, so they are
the more expensive in each category. Basically, Black and White horses
are mostly a larger status symbol saying 'see, I can afford the prettier
horse!' In reality, a Tan Silken Bridle runs as fast as someone else's
White Silken Bridle.

SoW is 34-55% speed increase depending on the level of the
caster(9-50). Run speed 1,2,3 are 10%, 20%, 30%, and Jboots/Tboots
are 35%. (for reference spirit of cheetah is 115% and bards
can move at 20-135% depending on level and instruments)
Paladin's and Shadow Knights AA war steeds are equivalent to
the top Ornate chain horses and are instant cast.
You do not gain mana at the sit rate while moving but
you do while just standing still.

Level 56 bard with a walrus drum in my guild raced a paladin
with his warhorse across the dreadlands and back. Bard not
only beat him but went back out and circled him a couple times
before the paladin made it to the finish line.

If you don't believe me test it yourself.
