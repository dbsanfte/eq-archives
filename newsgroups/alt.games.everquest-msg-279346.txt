I finally hit 46 a few weeks ago. Sometime next week or so I'm hoping
to hit 47.  I realize that's the very low-end of the higher-end game,
but I am finally getting there :)
I doubt raids will ever be a part of my experience for the
above-mentioned reasons.  As it stands, I've only ever managed one LDON
crawl, while my wife has never been in an LDON (she's still kinda
pissed I played without her that one day, and I managed to get a
group).  I don't know if she's been on any raids, as she's been playing
long before we met.

So, you at least know of one person who'se stuck with crappy small
single-group/solo equipment.
