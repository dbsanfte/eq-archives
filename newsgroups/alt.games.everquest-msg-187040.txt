True enough - I know they're intended as a group class (which seems a bit
irrational if you're going to call the class 'rogue', but still) but I've
never been that thrilled about casting classes and warriors are too
straightforward...  And the combination of Dark Elf and rogue gave me hide
and sneak, which is nice.  Actually I like the choice, tricky though it is.

Did try a druid at one stage but, I dunno, it just didn't really sit right.
Actually I still have a Wood Elf druid knocking around, but only at about
level 4 and I don't play that char much.

Cool - Patrik Nordebo seems to agree with you on the KoS thing, so I'll see
if I can find a nearby way up there and check on these caverns.  I am
agnostic so that's promising!

I'm usually more co-operative than I've been in this thread - especially
when it's me asking for help!  But like I said, I'm not the perfect
personality.  I'm tolerant of a lot of things but I can't stand pomposity.
I don't know (or particularly care) whether that was what Ben intended to
convey but either way, he did it brilliantly.

Anyway, there's no point going over and over it so I'm going to forget about
it now, but thank you for your advice on this one.

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
