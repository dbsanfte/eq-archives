Lvl limits...you mean flagging, yes?  I hope you don't mean removing the
62 level limit.  I'm personally very glad they at least have level limits
in place.  

If you had all 65s...how many would be needed to handle Auliffe?  And if
your contingent was more a range of 62-65...how many then?

Aww, what the heck, I SAID I wanted experience learning how to do what

the side.  What a better chance to lea...LOADING, PLEASE WAIT
