The new patch apparently did more than open the new zone.  One very
noticeable change was with the crazed goblins which are part of the
Ghoulbane quest and are found in Butcherblock.  Among other thing the number
of spawned goblins apparently has been reduced from 3 to two and the spawn
time has been increased somewhat.  More importantly, the magical resistance
of these mobs has been increased significantly.  After hunting them all last
weekend to level to 34 I found that they had a lot of resistance to all
spawns, but that was nothing compared to what I found today.  Today 8 out of
ten of my pulls either resisted ensnare altogether, or broke ensnaring roots
as soon as it was applied, this compares to 20 or 30 percent that showed
serious resistance earlier.  Moreover, many goblins today repeatedly
resisted both of these spells as well as immolation and Fury of Sky and at
least three ran me entirely out of mana before I killed them.  All this
occurred despite the fact that I had added xp from the past weekends work
and that I had in the meantime added to my wisdom which should have
increased the effectiveness of my casting.

In conclusion I would say that this site is no longer very useful for
gaining xp, for xp can be had a  faster rate elsewhere, with far less risk,
and that Verant has finally succeeded in reducing what began as a very nice
camp for players in the mid to high 30s into a camp that few will stay at
longer than is necessary to gain the quest item that is dropped there.
While this may all remain well and good and fit witching Verant's vision it
is a serious blow to any who would like to solo these levels and avoid
places such as OT and the Dreadlands until a few levels later. Ironically,
this will do nothing make the blade of nobility more available to players
since dropped blades were generally left to any who wanted them, and may in
fact make the blade more difficult to obtain, since the increased difficulty
of these mobs may mean that players will be unable to attempt to gain the
blade until their late 30s and will in effect render ghoulbane not only more
expensive than it is now, but make it less useful since by the late 30s and
early 40s other more useful blades are becoming available.
