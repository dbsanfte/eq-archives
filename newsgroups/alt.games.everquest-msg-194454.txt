Its been a very long time since I hunted mobs that could be affected by this
song, lets see.  Yep, Solon's Song of the Sirens, level 27 wind

Unless its been changed since those days, if you target a mob, turn on
charm, and don't turn off charm, you will keep charm on that target no
matter what you target afterwards.  I could be wrong about this but I really
think I recall it working.  And logic suggests it would, since the charm
keeps running as long as you have the song running (and 18 seconds
after).    This trick -does- work with mez,

The 39 song, Solon's Bewitching Bravura, does not work this way at all.
Sing it at a target, and when it lands the song stops itself.  Charm lasts
for a random duration which can be quite a bit longer than 18 seconds, but
you will definately eventually need to recast charm.  You also can't recast
charm on your pet to keep it constantly charmed, as while it is your pet you
can't cast any "detrimental" spells on it.  Sirens, it seems, avoids this
because you aren't starting a new song but just keeping the original
running.

This leads to some other interesting questions; say I start a DOT song on a
mob, then someone else charms it.  If I don't stop, can I keep the dot
running while the mob is our pet?  Of course I can't experiment with this
one solo.  How about I put DOT on one mob (perhaps a rooted one) and then
switch to another to melee?  Not a great plan, but would it work?  Are there
some actually useful tactics that might work using this little targetting
attribute of songs?

One that occurs to me is Jonathon's Inspiration; according to this sheet I'm
reading its a targetable single target haste/str/attack buff; can I put it
on the MA and the switch targets to melee the mob myself as well?

Well, it wouldn't work with Siren, which has just the 18 second duration;
with Bravura you may be looking at a minute or so from one pet.

Charm mob
Target second mob, tell pet to attack
Target third mob, lock mez on
Assist MA, melee.

When charm breaks (eventually) retarget former pet (easily done, escape to
clear your target box, and the next thing in it is your former pet who hates
you with the fury of a white hot sun) recharm, and sic him back on the mob
he's tank mezzing, then move back to your mez target and restick mez... its
about to wear off so you'd better hurry.

I've done 5 mobs worth of crowd control, pet, pet's target, mez mez mez
cycle back to first mez target.  It -does- fall apart from time to time, mez
resists, charm breaks, that sort of thing, but hopefully your group is
killing that other mob fast and coming to relieve you of some of your duty,
and the healer is busily keeping you alive (to heck with the MA, if you die
they have to deal with 6 mobs instead of just one)  This is the sort of
action that mezzing bards are made of, and that makes you long for an
enchanter in every group (such feats are far easier for them, although
surviving when something goes wrong is probably easier for us)
