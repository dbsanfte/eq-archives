The other comments are basically good information. Here are some
thoughts to consider:

1. If you didn't know, you eat and drink whatever is in the left hand
column (top to bottom order) then the right hand column (top to bottom)
so if you do sell stat food be sure to have your eatable food and drink
above and/or left of the stat food.

2. When considering pricing, think about how you will running your
trader. Will it be up 24x7 or just from when you quit/go to bed and
will shut it down in the morning? How much space do you have available?

I have a whole pile of stuff but usually concentrate on trade skill
items, like leather padding. I use dialup so I don't want to try to
keep it online 24x7 so I price my padding to move. If the lowest price
happens to be 50 plat per, then I might go to 40 or 35 or even 30. If
someone else wants to get more profit buying my stuff, more power and
profit to them. I just want the stuff to move at a price I can live
with.

3. I happen to use 6 trader satchels on my trader, though I have more
in the bank. I keep a large sack for food and water (I have a Ranger
who foraged up tons of water and roots :)) and a empty slot for when I
send the trader (in non-trade mode) over to buy stuff for my other
characters. This way the other characters, who are not camped in the
bazaar, can get items that show up.
Good luck and may your trading be fruitful.
