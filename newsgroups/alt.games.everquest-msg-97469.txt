He appeared on Tarew Marr, I was one of the first people to get to him,
after he shouted to the zone that he seeked proof of our enemies fear.

No one attacked him (I think, if they did they got sent splatting I guess)
and he apparently gave some people some things for whatever garbage they had
that dropped off various things that they killed.

Unfortunately, me and a friend were about the only people actually RPing, I
was talking about the magical chestplate of the Sarnak that they surrendered
to me with fear in their eyes as my magical swarms of insects ebbed the life
from their body, at one point he specifically mentioned me by name when
asking "Do you have proof of their fear?", but when I tried to give it to
him it popped up an NPC trade window for about half a second before it said
"your trade has been cancelled"

After about 5-10 minutes of this, he said to challenge him to prove our
devotion to fear, then started proccing stuff on us, one was a minor dot
that turned everyone into skeletons, one was a stun/fear with really long
duration, and the other was a major Gflux/Knockback that sent people nearly
halfway across the zone, I think he also used a PBAOE type spell once
because a lot of people fell over dead, and I went to nearly half health.

Eventually he did die, and some level 60 shaman ninja looted everything off
him (gm corpses for events are lootable by anyone), he had the junk people
had given him, a Living Thunder earring and a couple other very nice
droppable items that I don't remember, of course the shaman kept the good
stuff (bastard) and let everyone fight over such uberlewts as a Sarnak
Ceremonial Chestplate.

People were complaining that he hadn't given them anything for whatever they
turned in to him, until someone mentioned to check their inventories, of
course I hadn't gotten anything because he had cancelled my trade. =/

All in all it was ok, but oh god the lag of 130+ people trying to zerg The
Big Turd... ow.

On the bright side, someone earlier that day had thrown an Obulus Death
Shroud at me, so at least I didn't feel that bad about not getting anything.
