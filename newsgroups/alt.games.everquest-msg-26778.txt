    Read the comments of someone who posts here like Sang closely. Many of
the "endgame players" don't regard achieving level 60 as anything
important - given enough time, they feel almost anyone could do it. Heck,
Sang's guild can apparently PL someone to 60 in two weeks real time! To
them, the sense of achievement comes in knocking over the endgame boss mobs
with as few people as possible, to show they "have skills". I think that's
not a true statement - having fewer players is a reflection of gear
capability to a large extent, and that's a reflection of time spent in game.
Given enough time, I feel ANYONE could put together a group of people to
knock over the endgame mobs. The excitement is in seeing who does it first.

    VM is very strict, Wraith is more relaxed, LC is the most laid-back of
all in terms of prerequisites to get in. And they will waive the rules for
ANY class they need - all three have asked me to join, because I'm an
unguilded level 59 cleric (dinged last night!) and they all need clerics.

    So far, only VM has play time requirements. I don't know about Wraith,
but I know that LC is considering a points system, which is a de facto
demand on availability and play time.

    Once you understand the personalities involved, and the challenges they
face, it becomes easier to understand. Occy/Ziggen (former leader of Vis
Maior, now missing without explanation to the guild) forbid his guild from
trading ANY items from Howling Stones or Sebilis to any other guilds, back
at a time when only VM was in either zone (they owned HS for a month).
Reason? He wanted the competitive edge - he wanted to be FIRST on our server
to kill mob X, and that means edging out all the competition. All the top
guild leaders have that competitive spirit. Gnix (former leader of LC, now
guild officer due to demands of his Naval career) was so angry recently that
he started debate on a points system for LC. Reason? LC had a clear shot at
the 350 Dain, and about 20 people showed up only - including a mere two
clerics. They couldn't take him, so another guild swooped in and ate him and
his lewt up.

    Is it a job? I think it borders on it, yes. These folks have decided
that they want to be the best, and will put in the time to do it. They
derive enjoyment from being the best. It's not for me, but I can see why
others enjoy it so much.
