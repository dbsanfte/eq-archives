No I don't.

Not my problem.

No it's not.

Shopping at a mall is not a roleplaying environment. A mmorpg is. That
might be one of the worst analogies in history, get your head on
straight.

So you did in the end figure out how bad it was yourself....

Not my problem.

I owe them nothing. If they are dealing with my character, then it is
my character who is responding. If they are dealing with me in real
life, then it is me in real life who will respond. If they can't tell
the difference it's, once again, not my problem.

When playing my female characters in any event I do nothing that
someone would call "female", they just do the same whatevers as
everyone else. Therefore there's no misleading going on even when its
ambiguous whether or not it is the character or the player who's
actions are in question. After that, the other players are welcome to
believe whatever the fuck they want; I'm not playing EQ to make real
life friends and if I happen to do so anyways, as with some guildies,
they always know the truth. It's not like I deny it when people ask.
The rest of the population can go hang itself for all I care about
what it thinks of who I am.

Except apparently its not, according to you, unless you go around
telling people the truth behind the player *beforehand*.

I owe them nothing.

Improper? According to whom? You?

This may come as a shock but you are not the sole judge of what is
improper behavior. I say it's not. Deal with it.
