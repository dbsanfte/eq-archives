Had a killer group last night, only reason we made it was mage mod rods, 
bardic-fu and necro twitch [we had a bad pull in mistmore and ended up 
with 6 mobs shagging us and poor little clerical me died and couldnt get 
kei at the entrance=( ]

cleric, necro, mage, paledin, monk and bard.

I like grouping with BLs and druids and rangers. If I am not the one 
starting the group and one of my druid or ranger friends are in game I 
try to convince the people in my group to give them a try. Once they 
have grouped with one of them, then they tend to keep inviting the 
classes in=) I have finally grouped with rogues and seen that they can 
do some serious damage...and have a new appreciation for the class 
[though i dont think i would roll one up...well, maybe on test=)] I have 
grouped with wizzies before, and i actually have an 11th level DE wizzy 
myself...but I really havent seen a lot of them tryig for LDoN 
fun...would like to run a dungeon with one sometime soon.
