Far cheaper to jsut fich. i have never made lures, I jsut take a store-bought
stick and bait and I am at 160 now, and all the free fish scales (for Enduring
breath) and free food I can handle, plus I hear that you can catch fish in
Skyfire in a little pond that sell at the vendor for 2pp each if you are a Grand
Master (201+) at fishing.
