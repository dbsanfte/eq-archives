Indeed, there is more....
Alternate experience skills starting at level 51 (You can train innate run
speed for one)
Addition of many new zones (and therefore items), so the taking turns at
sharing a spawn isnt so much of an issue.
Removal of the spellbook to meditate. You only have to sit now.
Addition of "raid" channels. These are used for all sorts of things other
that raids. We have a "rez" and "auction" channel to name some.
Addition of many new spells.
New races/classes.
There is more.
