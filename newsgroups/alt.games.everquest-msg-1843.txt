Really depends on the type of the caster and his play style. My shaman 
has about 140 wisdom at level 51, and he's more than happy with his 
amount of mana.
Remember that your wisdom will affect the size of your mana pool, but 
not the regeneration rate. You can only cast as fast as mana 
regenerates, so if you don't go OOM every fight, then you don't need 
more mana. Usually druids need as much mana as they can hold for soloing 
though
