It's been so long since I've been there, that I'd have to actually look 
through the shaman spells there again to even know what was wrong.  I 
know some spell descriptions were misleading, and at least two had spell 
vendors listed incorrectly, which at the time, pre PoP, pre Luclin, was a 
big deal to have to get all the way over to Firiona Vie, or wherever else 
to find said spell not available there.
