Agreed, a good third or more of my gear is STR/WIS, thankfully with a good helping
of ac as well, I am surprised at my ac actually given that I am a druid, it is
substantially higher (more than I woudl have expected) than any pure caster close to
my level, and not too far short of a lot of tanks (as in within 100-150 points). I
can even step in and take a few hits from a giant without being too worried about
how I am "not supposed to be a tank"
