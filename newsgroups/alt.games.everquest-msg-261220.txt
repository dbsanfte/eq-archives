Nope, you're correct.   If you filter the spam out completely, then it won't
appear in your log for later parsing.

You can minimize the spam window and have it still record, but you can't
block it completely.

I've seen some complex setups... like a friend that has at least 6 different
windows..  guild, combat, group, 3 different chat channels all going to
separate windows... but I like mine nice and simple.

One window for all chat, one window for all combat spam.    I will
occasionally open a third window and minimize it, if I want to parse other
people's damage over a fight.    (Turn on other's hits and send them to that
window minimized)
