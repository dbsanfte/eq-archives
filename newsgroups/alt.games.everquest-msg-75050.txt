As a cleric, your role will be easy. Once the King Room and the other
giants and Vox's little helpers are cleared, the leader will call to set
up the buff line. You'll stand with the other clerics and issue the
buffs you are asked to give. Then the melee will camp out while you and
the other casters med up and buff yourselves. Next, the melee will camp
back in and start the attack. They will all have hotkeys made saying
(either in /ooc or /guild if it's just your guild) "Warrior_01 is coming
and needs a heal!" or somesuch. Look for these incoming wounded dragon
fighters, coordinate with the other clerics, and heal them as they
arrive so they can go back into the battle.

If you heal enough times, you'll get to hear those fun, famous words;

Lady Vox says 'You will not evade me, Quindell!'

Which will be followed by an immediate, beautiful, up close view of the
white dragon for about two seonds, followed by:

Loading .... please wait.

Try to be quick getting the screenshot.
;-)

Should you survive, you'll probably be rezzing all the fallen while
waiting for the loot to get split up, if you are one of the highest
level clerics present.  Good luck. She can be a chore to take down if
your leader is clueless or the group structure is weak.
