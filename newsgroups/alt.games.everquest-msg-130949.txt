Don't think this is directly related to Windows 2000 as much as the video
card driver. This problem showed up when Luclin came along requiring DirectX
8.1. Check your video drivers and see if you have the latest ones installed.

I had the same problem but after a few patches VI managed to get it cleared
up (for me anyways). My video card is a GeForce2 MX 400 (64Mb RAM) using
drivers 12.41.
