I agree it's useful and easy to get.  We have a regular group on
Thursday nights and by tomorrow all of us will have LDON so we wanted
to just get started once everyone is logged on.  We'd start with a
close one so travel is not an issue, and if not required everyone can
get the stone on their own time...

Thanks.
