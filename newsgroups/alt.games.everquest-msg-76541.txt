Since the change to the direct x 8 engine, freeport and rivervale are
HORRIBLY lagged for me graphically even though I did not upgrade old
areas to new textures. 

The problem seems to be that clipping does nothing in rivervale or the
freeport zones and they are pretty big open outdoor zones when
compared to one indoor zone in neriak.  Really all you can do is turn
off sky all the way, turn textures to low in options, turn off dynamic
lighting. 

As I said clipping does nothing so is of no help. To test this there
first turn it down all the way and run around, then turn it up all the
way and do the same. You see just as far. Now try this in a luclin
zone such as shadow haven, clipping there is a HUGE difference with
how far you see and my frame rate in luclin cities is far higher than
in freep or rivervale.
