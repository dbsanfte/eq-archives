Hi,

Now I am a bit confused ... why 75-150 bucks ? Your account is not bound to
one server, you can create the full number of chars on ALL servers ... so no
need to get a new set of discs (if thats what you meant) ... I enjoy both
versions, PvP and "blue", so why not take a break and look what you will
like more "after the gameplay changed".

Good luck and have fun

Christian
