Wrong again.  I stated that I've not seen any convincing evidence
that Archery is overpowered.  As for the "nerf" being inappropriate,
if the problem is that Archery is doing too much damage then the
archery/root "nerf" is just stupid.  It reduces the situations in
which a Ranger can solo while if anything making it easier to arrange
for Archery to do maximum damage (one of the requirements for max
damage is that the target to be stationary and <not> rooted).
