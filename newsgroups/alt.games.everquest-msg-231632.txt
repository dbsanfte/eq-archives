"Who are you keeping him or me?" 

You can always do something else, or change characters.

I have a worse than ignore list, I have the
I-wont-pee-on-you-if-you-were-on-fire-list I don't want them on
ignore, if they address me I petition. This is for scammers and known
griefers. Eventually they go away and the list fades.

I would not even use tells, I would just say so-and-so is on my bad
list, he has been a bad boy. I am leaving unless he does. Usually the
griefer leaves fast, when he has not, I do. Once I got a tell, "you
are right he IS an idiot!"
