While that is true... Way back when you used to be able to bind your sense
heading skill to an arrow key. I really mean it was perfect and natural. You
would move around and everytime you changed directions you would
automatically get a sense heading skill use just like you would in real life
walking through a park.

But no! That wasn't good for the game! So "I don't want to reward people for
mindlessly clicking a mouse" Verant and company changed it such that you had
to sit their mindlessly clicking a mouse button. A little inconsistant of a
policy IMO.

The real policy is "I want you to sit there mindlessly harvesting monsters
above all and to the exclusion of everything else. If you want to do
anything else, we well make it as painful as possible to discourage you." It
is an OK policy, just not explicitedly stated.
