*sigh*
I would really appreciate it if Verant could back down on their idiotic
decision to take away the server pop numbers.  So this morning I'm up
early and figure I'll sneak in a couple hours soloing my necro before
things get up and going. "Cannot connecto to login server. Please try
again shortly."

It's not patch day, and the sony page *claims* all the servers are up.
But if they are up and empty, then I'd know that there's problems with
the login and not connectivity problems on my end.
*sigh* again.
