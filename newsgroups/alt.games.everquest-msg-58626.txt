Dan,

I bought the magazine mainly for the CD for a friend who didnt yet know if
he wanted it or not and to read the magazine (hell for $10, I should
probably read it MANY times).  I had no clue it confined you to a "demo"
server.  In fact, this was three days ago where the highest on the server
was 13.  I was half tempted to make a druid and be the highest on the
server. <grin>  But, I said screw it.  He eventually paid the $10 for the
month just today because he liked the game (gee, imagine that one). <shrug>
Okay, going back to reading my magazine for the fifth time so I can get this
stick feeling thing out of my rear.
