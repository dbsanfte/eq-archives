From what I have read on Verants boards, they indicate that the current 8
slots is more than they would prefer.  The decision for 8 goes back to the
beginning and they didn't know how popular EQ would be and felt having the
ability to play many races would help the initial success.   Hence some of
the new servers only offering 1 slot.  There post reguarding this is
probably still on the dev board if you want to look.
