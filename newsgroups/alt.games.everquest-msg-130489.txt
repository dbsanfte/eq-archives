That would be the better course I would think.  Surely you don't think
*your* morals are the ones everyone else should live by and therefore you
should impose your will on anyone who might have such "wrong" beliefs.

Suppressing speech does not suppress thought.  It is therefore pointless at
best, and at worst antagonistic and amounts to no more than hiding your
head in the sand.  On top of that, paraphrased from someone else in this
thread, "I want to know who hates me."
