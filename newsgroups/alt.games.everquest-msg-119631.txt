We should post a list of favourite low-greed vendors. I'm quite fond of 
Parthar at Inn 1 in East Commons, or Merchant Tekrama in the Bazaar. Never 
been ripped off by those.

I used to use fire beetle eyes to gauge prices, but it's probably too cheap 
an item to catch subtle differences. I don't always have a cabbage with me, 
though. =)
