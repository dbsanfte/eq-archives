I ran my level 10 test ranger around the other day (she still needed a
bone from CB, from the orc slavers). As I ran up to CB from Kelethin,
I was treated to the following conversation with a 25 ranger in gfay:

ranger tells you, 'u do kno u can get to level 25 just by typing
right?'
You told ranger, 'yes. you do know not everyone wants to do that?'
ranger tells you, 'yea i kno'
ranger tells you, 'just letting u kno =P'

Lucky me.

Anyway, I got to CB, found it deserted, killed a couple smaller orcs,
decided 'screw this', made myself a testbuffed druid, pulled and
killed the slavers and got the bone the level 10 needed to complete
her newbie armor. So it can be nice to be able to pull a higher
character out of your hat like that, but I would never dream of
actually playing something that soulless.
