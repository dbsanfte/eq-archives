Ya know I think every one would be more understanding of the Warriors
plight had not this been about the forth go round of this stuff. Last
time it was the monks who were causing warriors to go groupless. So
monks get nerfed to hell and back. Now its the Knight classes fault,
ya know this is getting old. Shelve that broken down piece of crap
warrior and start a knight. Maybe if enough do this they will fix
warriors but prob SoE will only nerf knights. Sheesh whos next? Bards?

But they get plate, duel wield, and high agro songs. Warriors have
nothing to compete with Bards for groups.........see my point is that
if holding agro is the most important thing then even Bards do this
better than warriors.

Face it Warriors are just so dam broken, but maybe the whole idea is
broken since they seem unable to fix it. Start a knight .....or quit
heh. I recomend quitting but thats just me.
