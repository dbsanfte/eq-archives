Have you tried to start a ranger ?

mine is level 42 now, and i can still solo without too much downtime, when i
dont feel like grouping. I know that everyone says that it is impossible to
get in a group with a high level ranger but i have never had any problems.
Also if you make it a human you start out in the Qeynos hills very close to
BlackBurrow wich is an excellent zone, you can hunt there solo and in groups
from about level 6 maybe 8 and up to about 16, good for both solo and
grouping. The drawback however is that you will be blind as a bat at night,
but it is still doable. One major advantage to the ranger is tracking, with
this skill you can easiely pick your prey and dont have to run around doing
/con on every mob you meet.

well thats just my 2cp of advise....
