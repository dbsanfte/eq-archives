Sure -- you will find that the Halas natives are amiable to Vah Shir.

Also, take some notes of spell prices at the scribes in Shar Vahl, 
and compare to the prices quoted at the Halas shaman guild. The 
difference is worth making the trip the the frozen north every
five levels.

Another FYI: Stragak, the troll vendor in Innothule who carries
the poison/disease spells, is indifferent to everyone, so you 
can buy them from him if you're in that neighborhood.
