Hmm, I didn't see that. Now, I know it's usually worded as 'Your equipment 
durability will be reduced to 25%' rather than saying it will be reduced by 
75%. That might be where you saw the 25% (or it might not be, it might be 
changed in a patch...at the moment, though, it's still 75% durability loss, 
or at least it was last night *grin*).

Totally. That was the thing I always hated the most about EQ1, the zoning.

EQ2 just never won me over. I played for a while, but eventually went back 
to EQ1...then a friend showed me WoW. Once I got it, I still played EQ1 a 
bit, but whenever I was on EQ1, I was bored and just kept thinking, 'I could 
be playing WoW right now...' So, I cancelled my subscription, which runs out 
the middle of this month.

Heh, yes, I do actually. :) The Orc hunter has a raptor as a pet, the Tauren 
hunter has a Named scorpion as a pet (I kept the name, Death Flayer, 
although I had to lose the space when I renamed it to its original name), 
and the Night Elf hunter went through hell, literally, to get a vampiric 
duskbat as his pet (at level 12, he was running almost the full length of 
the Eastern continent, through zones 10-20 levels higher than he was, and 
facing certain death many times at the hand of the Horde (pvp server) to get 
to the Undead area to tame that bat. Half a hundred times he died on that 
historic run.). Although I like playing a warrior also (my current 'mains' 
are the night elf hunter and the human warrior), surprisingly so for myself.
