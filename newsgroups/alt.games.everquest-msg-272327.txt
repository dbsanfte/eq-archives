Your ignoring what I'm saying and just assuming the EQ1 model.

Why would a player playing a druid in a game where druids -could- easily 
fill in for a cleric in most situations, came with a rez, but which 
particularly weak for one class of encounters, but particularly strong 
in another (a set where clerics were particularly weak) be told to make 
a cleric alt? That doesn't even make sense!

If being reduced to a 'cleric wearing green pants instead of white 
pants' improves your satisfaction with your class, then yes. Otherwise, 
no.

They've been balanced by making them equivalent. There are other, much 
better, ways of balancing things. Consider an RTS with 4 armies... the 
designers can give each army the same set of tools, and give them 
different graphics and it *will* be balanced. Or the designers can give 
them radically different tools, and balance it by ensuring that each one 
has its fortes and foils, and verify it with playtesting and monitoring 
player feedback.

The former results in a much blander game. (Consider which RTSes and 
Stragety games have stood the test of time and the approach they took to 
army balancing!)

Neither does having the class you choose be largely irrelevant. Pick a 
'healer' any 'healer', nobody cares if you are a druid or a cleric, they 
are equivalent! Really sucks the life out of being a class X, at least 
for me.
