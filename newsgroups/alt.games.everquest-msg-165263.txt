    It's the only meaningful question: how does the monk in question stack
up versus other classes on a raid? How he does in XP groups will obviously
depend so strongly on what other classes show up that it's not even worth
considering without making assumptions about the XP group. But that won't
stop Eduin! If you were to compare the abilities of classes in a total
vacuum, as you suggest, be sure to eliminate a rogue's backstabs since
they'll be tanking!

    If his point is "solo, you do more damage than I" it's a moot point
since neither of them will be soloing any more. If his point is "in XP
groups, you do more damage than I" it's flat-out wrong since I can easily
construct an XP group where anyone outdamages anyone else. And as I
demonstrated, he has no point to his ranting on raids. ;-)
