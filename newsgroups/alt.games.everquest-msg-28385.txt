Sounds like you haven't played a poor character in a while. I'm currently
playing a low level untwinked cleric (12) who gets pretty much zero loot 
in groups and has to wander off and solo bears etc for skins to make cash. 
A cleric doesn't really need much (though armor helps a lot) but spells do cost. 

One system i've seen very recently is that the tanks (who pretty much loot as
mob drops, maybe they're using mouselook?) split their cash every
once in a while. The monks and twinks don't like it but it's not too much
trouble to drop or destroy coppers and silvers. The tank has to remember to
visit the bank or otherwise empty their pockets of gold/silver/copper (this 
is pre-plat loot levels) first but that's not hard.
