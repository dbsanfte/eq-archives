What I see this as is more of a reaction to being pelted for three
years with "WHY CAN'T I CHANGE MY NAME WHENEVER I WANT?". Finally,
they break down and say "Fine, here, you can change your name now. But
it'll cost ya..." Was the same with the server transfers, IMO. "You
want it so bad, we'll give it to you. But you better be damn sure
we're gonna make money off of it in return for your incessant
whining..."
