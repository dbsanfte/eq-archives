True = 1, thus you can
/loadskin myskin 1
Or use it interactively:
/loadskin (Choose myskin and choose save settings)

Much. :)

A fun skin I put together is here:
http://www.emptiedout.com/eq/dod/

It has a 4x size Target Life meter(split into quarters anddisplaying a % of 
life left) and it has %'s on your mana, HP, exp, and groupmates health. 
Also featuring a slimmed down inventory and tons of other stuff I ganked 
from various skins/mods.
