I don't know the answer to some of these questions but will add what I
can for the others.

Not sure, but I will tell you that the GMs don't seem to do much about
the more minor rules being broken.  For example it is illegal to
intentionally train guards on someone.  But on a PvP server, don't
count on a petition acheiving much.  I suspect that there are a lot
more complaints coming from people on those servers, so they tend to
pay less attention to them.

> Do races fight amoungst themselves or is it a "good vs evil" type thing?

There are several servers with different rules about who can kill
whom.  You can play on teams, based on things like your deities or
races.  You can also play pure PvP, where anyone can kill anyway.  It
all depends on the server you chose.
