I can't read the stats on the augment at all on that, but I do see the 
wins record; looks like you have to get 70 wins in each type to max it 
out.  I don't have 70 missions run all told, much less 5 times that 
many, it will be a LOOOOONG time before I'm capping this thing out.

Funny thing is, the missions get harder as you level up; if you really 
wanted a capped out augment the best strategy would be to run a new alt 
up to 20 with 6 friends, twink up to the nines and then go in and go 
crazy.  Get Temperance and... what else can a low level party get that 
will last thru a half hour or so mission?  Call of Earth?  Lots of stuff 
really that will at least get you halfway thru, party of that level 
isn't going to be taking 90 minutes a run

Take only slaughters, and leave instantly on success, ready to go again.

Probabably be level 40 by the time you are done, but thats not so bad

Splendid
