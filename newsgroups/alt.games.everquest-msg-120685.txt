It definately seems so this patch for necromancers ; )

First off the excellent pet changes in case I ever get competent to consider
grouping - now the focus items. A whole stack of my items are now focus
items and a lot of the spells a necromancer uses 50+ are still below level
45 because they server a particular purpose.

My gift items were ~

Golden Efreeti Boots - Enhancement Haste 2. Will only effect dead man
floating and buffing time isn't exactly critical but since they are nice
stats I won't look a gift horse in the mouth.

Dustcryer Crystal Ball - Extended Affliction 3. ooooooooo... *grins
stupidly*

Rokylls Channelling Crystal - Extended Enhancement 3. Was sitting in bank
collecting dust - will now be swapped into place for buffing.

Drachnid Thyxl - Enhanced Spell Damage 2. My current offhand item, looks
like ignite bones going to become a favourite again....

Cougar Claw Earing - Extended Range 3. Who doesn't have a half a bag of
these lying around? I can afford to lose a Batskull earing's worth of int
when working outdoors.

Blackened Alloy Medallion - Mana Efficiency 2. I used RunneyEye as my
training wheel dungeon - all 5 of my characters have one of these. This will
actually make it back onto the Chimp too (until the crowd for the Obulous
Shroud dies down), as well over half the spells he casts are below level 45.

For once being an equipment peasant seems to have paid off. Anyone else find
themselves wearing idiotic grins since the last patch?
