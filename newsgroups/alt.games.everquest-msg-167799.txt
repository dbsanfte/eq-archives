The best place to play a rogue is behind a mob. Every zone in the game has
mobs which have a back. Any zone that you can get a group in and fight from
behind is good.

When a mob is pulled run in front and start attacking while at the same time
circle strafing to position yourself behind the mob. From here you can use
your special backstab skill. I find this method of engaging a mob to be much
better as you do not lose any dps.

Rogues no matter what level are extremely difficult to solo with. A rogue
has the same hp as a shaman and even though a rogues ac can be high the
damage mitigation is nowhere near as good as a plate class.

A rogues main role in the group is to provide damage. Once you have your
healer, your tank and some form of crowd control it is now time to look for
a damage dealer. This is where the rogue steps in. The rogue class is the
highest damaging melee class. Although at the very end game it is possible
for monks to outdamage a rogue but for for the remaining 99% of the eq
player base this is not the case.

For more information it is best to visit *the* rogue community known as the
safehouse. Here you can get alot of good advice on the rogue class.
