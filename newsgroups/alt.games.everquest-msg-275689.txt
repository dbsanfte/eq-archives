Do the watcher of the plains centaur quests improve faction? He's down on
the south....urm...east? Of the map... going from memory here. Anyway,
theres 2 'talky' centaurs, one is him who gives 6 quests, and another
a woman who says she doesnt trust you. I would think if you do his quests
maybe she will - but whether thats from faction or quest flags I dont know.
