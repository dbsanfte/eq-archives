Brief hijaac here but Please explain how you have come to the determination
that Hitler was "Smart"? There are many types of "Smart" People smart,
street smart, book smart, high IQ, good education, etc.
    - Did ordering the gassing of millions of people make him smart? Maybe
he was trying to improve the job market by killing lots of people so there
wouldnt be any unemployement...
    - Or maybe when they were low on money and gas the orders to just
through the children in the furnace like wood was a smart way to save money
on fuel?
    - Did ordering the genitals of young boys and girls removed with no
anesthesia make him seem smart?
    - Maybe cutting open twins with no anastasia and sewing their blood
vessels together and letting them rot in pain to die was a good idea?
    - Hey I know dont use coupons, save on food, dont feed anyone for a year
and see what happens.

I think you should take a quick look at some of the things he was in charge
of and possible re-assess your opinion of "Smart". Heres some links for you:
Look carefully at the pictures and what was done.

Lets rephrase that together, Hitler wasnt "Smart" he was Persuasive in
getting people to follow him, affective in making people do what he wanted,
and lacked any and all pitty, moral, and consiounce. A "Smart" man would
know what is right and what is wrong, an insane man lacks the intelligence
and reason to figure it out on his own.

p.s. Im sure my spelling and grammer are not perfect. I never claimed to be
"Smart"
