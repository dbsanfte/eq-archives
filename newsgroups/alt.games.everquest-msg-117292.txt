Assuming your premise, they caused depression, they should be held
responsible in balance with their level of culpability.  I don't assume
your premise though.  Suicidal depression, other than by chemical
imbalance, is a matter of perception not stimuli.  A sunny day, a soft
puppy, a pretty girl, things that bring a smile to most folks may cause
dark despair, suicidal depression if you will, in others.  You can not
hold the day, the puppy nor the girl at fault because of how they are
perceived.  In that same manner I do not believe you can hold the game
responsible for how some people respond to it.
