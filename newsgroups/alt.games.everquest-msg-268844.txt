My monk and cleric could duo in Dranik's Scar at level 48 or so.  It
was a bit rought (damn those 450 damage procs!), but doable, and
Natimbi is, I think, even easier.  At level 58 it should be hard to
set up a functional group that could do anything much in PoP but
couldn't handle Dranik's Scar or Natimbi, though it may not be as good
exp as PoP.

I almost never use Call to Qeynos - what if I need it before the
hour-long reuse time is up?  But then I'm mostly staying a single zone
from Qeynos, so it's not much of a run.
