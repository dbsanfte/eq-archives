From the shadows, the mysterious kaev <tospam@nottospam.net> (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

He was making good points, as he saw them. Not trolling.

You got his back up early by misunderstanding his first post.

"That's odd. I never knew that it was the role of one player in one
guild on one server to define the roles of the hundreds of thousands
of other players across nearly fifty servers involved in a game he
pays for the priviledge of playing just as we all do."

He wasn't. He was echoing a sentiment a lot of warriors have, right or
wrong.
