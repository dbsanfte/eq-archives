Normally I'm in cable but I had to go and house sit my parent's house for a
while.  I have a separate dialup account in their area (no DSL, ISDN, ADSL,
cable, T1, or anything but satellite or 56k)

I usualy play EQ fine on 56K in the past but in the past few days it had
been unusually hard to get logged on.  Sometime it'd fail before I get
server selection screen, sometimes it'd fail after server selection screen
and if I ever make it to character selection screen thjere's about 1 in 10
chance I'd get past that.

I was playing with modem setting since there's no problem with the ISP or
the phone.  I finally got online with no problem after I turned the modem
down to 28.8K max.  Not only that, it seems to load faster and get through
all those logon and selection much quicker than I ever did with 56K.

I never had problem witht he modem in 56K mode before and could easily top
off 8Kbyte per second.  When I checked for downloading OoW with 56K, it'd be
over 8 hours.  I checked using 28.8K mode, it's still 8 hours???

Any idea why?  Something to do with OoW update perhaps?
