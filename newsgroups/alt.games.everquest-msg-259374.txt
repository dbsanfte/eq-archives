2% aa per kill in BoT (so 50 mobs for an AA), and less than 45 minutes to
get that AA in a fast pulling group, 1 hour in a group which spends a lot
of time talking, and 90 minutes in a group which hasn't been before.

This is in bazaar geared groups.  I've also been in elemental geared
groups, with people boxing the support classes (healer, slower, mezzer)
outside the group, so we had 1 tank and 5 dps in the group earning XP.  Now
that was fast.

And Kodtaz.

You don't need to be flagged to enter Tipt / Vxed?  Perhaps the person
getting the expedition does (I don't know, never did that bit), but
certainly the other five don't need to be.

I got Vxed and Tipt flags and then did Rondo.

I concur, having done it both ways, and watched friends do it both ways, my
advice to people in normal mid-level guilds, is level to 62, then go do AA
in BoT / HoH / PoV and mix in real XP as required.
