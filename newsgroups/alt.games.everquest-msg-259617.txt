If you zone before it dies the damage becomes unassociated like damage
from a damage shield or damage by a npc who is fighting the same mob.

That is how a high-level character can pull and fight a mob until it
is almost dead then zone and the lower-level character(s) to whom that
mob is maybe a deep red can fight and (hopefully) kill it and get the
xp.
