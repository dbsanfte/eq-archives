How is that a troll?  SWG has leveled off at about 250k subscribers, which
would be pretty good for an "normal" game (that gives it about 19% of the
North American MMORPG market, tied with DAoC, behind EQ at about 26% and
ahead of UO at about 10%).  However, SWG isn't a normal game...it is quite a
bit more expensive to run than other MMORPGs.

    1. Lucas gets a big cut.

    2. I expect customer support costs are higher than other games.  The
    game has a lot of things that EQ doesn't that are likely to generate
    support requests (e.g., housing).

    3. The game has higher resource requirements on the server side.  Their
    crafting and item system require significantly more data than EQ's or
    DAoC's, and require accessing item data more often.

    4. They have big software license costs that some others don't.  For
    example, they are using a very expensive database licensed by the amount
    of data they need to handle (we know this because one of the reasons
    they gave for not allowing more than one char per server was that they
    would have to buy a license for more data for their database).  Compare
    this to DAoC, which uses MySQL (license cost: $0) for its database.

Since they don't charge more than other games, they are almost certainly
making considerably less money than EQ, DAoC, or UO, and maybe even less
than AC or AO.

Combine that with their high expectations--they expected and planned for
being well beyond 250k subscribers at this point, and the word "flop" is
fairly accurate.

It will be interesting to see how the upcoming space expansion does.
