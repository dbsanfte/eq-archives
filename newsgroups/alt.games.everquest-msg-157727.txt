As an inky necro, I'm used to running for my life. I conned the guards in
the good section, and they were indifferent. I then hailed one. He told me I
would be welcome within, as long as I treated all with the same respect
accorded me. But I should be wary of any of the portals within, for surely I
could easily be killed reappearing on the other side, where I am likely not
welcome. (phrased differently, but equally charming).

I thanked the guard for the warning, and explored the good section with no
trouble. And I did not have trouble in Tranquility either.
