The requirement to leave it online for extended time frames which can be 
a real problem for some people.  It allows those that have a good 24/7 
connection to leave a trader up full time, but keep those with lesser, or 
perhaps more expensive, connections from doing the same.  It is costing 
SoE money in connect time, as their bandwidth requirements are higher 
with people keeping a trader online that is doing basically nothing.
