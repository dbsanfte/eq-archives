The Rogue Shroud made getting the Master Key to Howling Stones an
absolute breeze, too.  We'd spent two or three days getting through
the North and West bits due to slow pops, then battled our way through
the South and East bits in one afternoon, dying once in the process in
one fight when the healer of the trio fell through a trap in the East
sector and couldn't get to us to heal us  :D  Still, my pal got his
key.

Then, we thought we'd try Rogue Shroud to get the last two bits of the
key for me.  We could have picked the locks I suppose, but used his
key to enter the South and swing East through the secret door
connecting the two sectors.  It took all of 3 minutes to go through
both sectors using hide and sneak!!  You don't even appear when you
pick the bits of the Master Key off the ground, either.  We were most
pleased  :)

Make a hotbutton something like this (I have just roughed it out -
exact syntax is down to where you have your skills arranged, etc.)

My "Duck" Button

	Attack off
	Hide
	Pickpocket
	Disarm
	Attack on

Hopefully after a successful Hide the mob forgets you and turns away,
leaving a nice chance to practice Pickpocket.  As an ethical player, I
tell the group what I have nicked and share  it out.  Most mobs you'll
meet just own crap, so usually the group could care less, heh.

and my "Sneak" Button

Hide
Sneak
Sense Traps

Why Sense Traps?  Well, it gets skillups, and they never come in
wrong.

So, while only Rogues can Hide AND Sneak, don't forget Rogue Shroud
Form for those missions where stealth is the best method.
