Then I guess we have no right to complain about duping or exploiting or 
anything else.  We can all go happily about our playing, oblivious to 
people who duping or exploiting.  
I personally have a much, much bigger issue with people who use exploits, 
but I can see how something as overpowering as a fungi can upset people.  
It really does make it all-but-impossible to die for the first 30 levels 
or so.  (Yes, it can be done, but not unless you try.)
