My records have all been set in DL, since a LOT of high level people wanna get
away after KC raids, was hunting (and bound) in FM at DL zone, so whenever i had
to run to DL because of trains i usually checked if anyone offered money for
ports. Had a few people pay 100pp each for ports to WC or NK, and a guy paying
75pp and a cloak he looted (called "something" cloak, go in shoulder slot, had
some wis), that i later sold for 300pp.
But have not been that much in the port business, mainly used tradeskills to
make money, so its probably easy to beat those numbers, if youre in the right
place.
