I have noticed no difference between my Half Elf, Dwarf, Wood Elf, and
High Elf characters.  When my Enchanters have tried out Dark Elf (i.e.
ultravision) it made a huge difference.  Half Elf has the same vision
as the spell Serpent Sight, as do the other infra races.  My Human
Enchanter used Illusion: Half Elf for night vision for a long time,
until he started travelling more and it became worthwhile to have a
sight buff that didn't drop at the zone.  Of course, soon after that
I abandoned him, but I repeat:  Half Elf vision is identical to that
you get from the Serpent Sight buff (i.e. Crown of King Trannix).

I disagree, no point in giving up a slot for a crappy item to get
infravision, just find something useful that is also a greater
lightsource (Wu's Gauntlets come to mind for a lowbie Monk).

It could be my el cheapo monitor, it's not my charcter's race.  And the
caves in Netherbian lair, to pick one example, are awful with only
infravision, while they're quite tolerable with a greater lightsource
(my Warrior used to swap in a BABS just for the light when he went in
to pull).
