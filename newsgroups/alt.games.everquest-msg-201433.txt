I downloaded the original EQ from Sony and after entering in your email 
address they send you a CD key to use.  I just checked the website for the 
link and cannot find it now so maybe it's no longer offered.  I'm still using 
my free 30 days and even though I did have to put in my credit card info I'm 
pretty sure I can cancel before 30 days are up and not be charged.  The way 
it's going though I'll probably keep playing since it's so much fun.
