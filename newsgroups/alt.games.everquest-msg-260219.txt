LOL, I have been asked to do rezzes in HHK, left PoK and gotten 
there before the person who begged a port to north karana just 
running in from Qeynos, and my poor little cleric only has run3. 
Simply put, beats feets because you dont have to wait on anybody 
else. I have made it to CoM before the rest of the group beating 
feets rather than waiting for a port to EJ itself...and my poor 
computer isnt the fastest zoning box around either!

If you call and wait 2 minutes for a response, I am already out 
of PoK and zoned into the next zone, and by the time another 2 
minutes has passed and you are waiting to meet the druid 
somewhere I am already in the next zone and by the time you are 
zoning into that zone, i am into my 3d zone [unless we are 
talking that infernal run through west karana that takes me 3 
minutes and 40 seconds to cross, or the length of the airborn jodi...

I may be nuts, but I get my little cleric butt around norrath 
just fine on my own 2 feetses.
