when i first started playing EQ in october of 1999, one of the first
characters i created was a halfling cleric.  i got him up to level
nine.  then some friends bought the game and created some characters
on a different server, so i made a character on that server to play
with my friends.  i haven't played my halfling cleric since.

now i find myself wanting to go back and play that character again,
but i have a problem: i don't remember which server he lives on!
i guess i'll have to check each server one by one, but it would
help narrow the field if someone could give me a list of servers
that were up at that time.

thanks.
