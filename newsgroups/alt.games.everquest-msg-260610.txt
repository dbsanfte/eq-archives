The rest of the post might be a bit hard for me to swallow then! :(

Maybe they do =)

I just took this topic to my guildie bards actually... we have some
excellant bards, some average bards, some frankly shit bards.  Of the
excellant bards, 1 in particular is the best bard I've seen across multiple
servers (multiple play servers/guilds, beta servers etc).. so yeah, to me
hes the best bard in EQ.

Interestingly they all hold the same opinion, monks and bards both have
strengthes and weaknesses, each excells in different areas, but the real
winner is when monks and bards work together.  monk+bard > 1 monk, or 1
bard, or monk+monk or bard+bard etc... have to say, in my experiences that
holds pretty true too.  Of course im sure you know much better than me from
experiance, I mean.. i've only pulled every zone, expedition and boss to
date, all the way to tacvi (end of GoD) =(

Another point they all held is that anybody who claims "ONE_CLASS_ONLY" owns
everybody.. is that, well they are a dumbass. Can't say I disagree there
either =( And that goes whether your a bard monk or whatever.

If you really believe what you just typed, and didnt just type it for
reaction and to be a dick.. then sorry, but i stand by my initial comment.
You have never seen a real monk in action whos at the top of their game, and
you clearly aren't one.
