what about how one can't turn on auto attack while typing? is that a bug?
intentional? my atk key is not an alpha-numeric character (what's the fancy
way to say that?), but by default it's the "a" key, right? so....is it just
protection against people who never moved the key?

making it "a" by default, then printing in the manual (for RoK anyway) that
it is "strongly recommended" to remap it . .. .that = silly
