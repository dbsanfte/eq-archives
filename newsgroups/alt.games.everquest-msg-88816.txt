I'm afraid the best way is to buy another account, or not let him
play. I am on my computer from home alone, no one else gets on it and
I STILL don't have my password saved but enter it in every time though
its like 4 nonsensical letters and 8 numbers.

Its honestly best to tell him no otherwise he will get hooked and end
up wanting to play the times you are NOT at work also and this will
cause problems. 

Have him get his own account.. give the software to him as a gift,
etc. Give him a 3 month gamecard as a gift.. say "there's your
birthday ahead of time," etc.

The blocking the luclin server with a firewall is rather ingenious,
but then how do you get on it yourself.. and how do you ensure he is
not logging on the account from some other computer? Does your nephew
live with you?
