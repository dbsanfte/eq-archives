Heh. How about replacing the CD in the EQ box at the store with a mere 
certificate stating:

   "We here at SOE strive to make your EQ experience as painless as 
possible. Therefore, we have eliminated the need for you to even install 
EverQuest. We officially present you with this certificate of achievement 
so that you can experience the feeling of having "beaten" the game without 
ever having to go through the tedium of actually playing it. GRATZ! ...a 
$12.95 monthly subscribtion fee will still apply..."
