No problem!  When you first pop into EQ, your display is set for what Verant
considers a normal display (smallish game display with opaque displays for
inventory, spells, etc.).  By pressing <F10>, you can cycle through three
display modes ... this default mode, a second mode with a lot of the same
info available as in the default mode but with translucent windows, and a
full screen mode with nothing but Norrath as your display.

Normally, the first thing I would do when popping into the game is
immediately hit <F10> once to get to the second display mode.  However,
there is a setting in the eqclient.ini for 'ScreenMode' which can be
modified to change your default screen mode.  The setting of this parameter
when the game installs is 'NORMAL'.  By changing the setting to 'FULL', you
get the second mode as your default.  One less keystroke.

Also, by changing 'RunMode' from 'FALSE' to 'TRUE' in eqclient.ini, you
default running instead of walking.  One less click.

Hope this helps! :-)
