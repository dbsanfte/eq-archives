I suppose you might also be able to bring up the Windows Task Manager 
(CTRL+ALT+DEL or Right-Click on the Windows Task Bar). On the Processes 
page, locate EQGAME.EXE. Right-click and choose Set Priority and choose a 
lower priority. That could be changed right back when you were ready to 
get back in-game. I don't know if this would cause any problem with the 
game staying up or not though, as I've never tried it.

Honestly, I minimize the EQ window and can pretty much do anything else I 
want without having to do anything in particular. I've not seen much if 
any performance degradation as a result.
