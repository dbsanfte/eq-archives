Don't sweat it.  If you were wearing crap armor and using crap weapons
and having to do half-a-dozen runs for the zone and/or CRs for every
play session your weapon skills would still be lagging.  Try this
strategy instead:  Keep your 1H weapons and Bash up as well as you can
in combat, don't use the other three skills at all until you reach the
point where you are (finally) maxing out 1hs/1hb (probably in your
upper teens).  Use your excess practice points to bring up the others
somewhat while you're doing this.  Once you're gettting 1hs/1hb maxed
in normal use start doing one of the 2handers, continue dumping unused
practive points into the weapons you aren't using yet, add the others
into the mix as you get to where you're maxing what you're using.  By
L30 you should have all of them maxed.

See above.  In addition, DEX affects weapon skill-ups.  Your twink is
probably over-equipped, swapping in a few pieces of junk with DEX on
them should help skill-ups without lowering your AC enough to matter.
Executioners Hood, Golden Black Pearl Necklace, Darkmail Gauntlets,
Grotesque Alloy Mask, and etc.  More expensively, the Bracelet of
Quickness(?) has +15 DEX.  Get weapons that have DEX on them.  Until
your weapon skills are all up near 200 (the pre-51 cap), DEX is your
friend.  After that it helps proc frequency, but that's less important
than the AC and HP upgrades you'll be able to get by replacing the DEX
gear when you're close to L40.
