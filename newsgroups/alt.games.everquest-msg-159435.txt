I would highly recommend not trying planes other than PoK below mid 46.  The
minimum to get into plane is 46.  If you die at 46 and the rez doesn't re-ding
you, at least in the Plane of Innovation, you cannot be rezzed back.  My cleric
tried.  Monk got exp back but it wasn't enough to re-ding and he was barred from
zone until he went and made enough exp to re-ding outside the zone.  I was
completely blown away by this, didn't even occur to me to petition or report it.
I will have to next time.  Has anyone else experienced this in PoP's 46+ zones?
