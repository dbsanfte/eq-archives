  I have a few questions.  First, how old is your guildmate's son, is
he still living with his parents?  I ask because there comes a point
where a parent is no longer quite as responsible for the actions of
their children.  Good parenting may tend not to produce asshole
thieves as often, but if he's 25 and living on his own now, it's not
as if she could've disciplined him by canceling his EQ account or
whatever.  If he's 16 and still living at home, there is certainly
some disciplinary action that she can and should take, in my opinion.

  More importantly, has your guildmate given any indication about
whether or not she approves of his or her son's actions, aside from
the circumstantial evidence that indicates that she might have been
involved?  If you confront her and she comes up with some
lame-sounding BS excuse, or condones her son's actions, or just flat
out ignores you, I'd /guildremove her immediately.  If she seems to
regret what happened and makes a genuine effort to get her son to
return the money, I might keep her on, depending on what her prior
conduct has been like, what action she takes regarding her son, ect.

  It sounds like the person who gave your guildmate's son was a bit of
an idiot anyhow, though.  You don't just give somebody 10,000pp
without some sort of collateral unless you have a really good reason
to trust them... plus I don't know of any other reason why they would
need somebody to hold 10,000pp for them unless they were planning on
doing some twinking.  I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for people
who twink who are a poor enough judge of character to give a thief
that huge a sum of money.

  That's just my take.
