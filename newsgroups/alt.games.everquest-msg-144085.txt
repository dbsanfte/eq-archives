Other guilds would be doing ntov now so I doubt you want your servers best
guild contending for content you are doing.

Theres no real way to say that LoS did infact exploit at this stage as they
have not announced what they did and VI has not made any announcement
publicly about the incident.

There is a thing to think about though. When Velious was released ST was
incomplete, ntov was broken, PoM is still broken. When Luclin came out Vex
Thal was incomplete, RoV was not exactly complete and inner acrylia is not
done.

I think it would be better if Verant started to release these expansions
once they are complete entirely. Who cares if the expansion is not the top
selling title during the christmas period. I think gamers would rather
appreciate a game that is complete, or in this case an expansion.
