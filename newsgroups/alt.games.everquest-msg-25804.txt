It's really not all that important, though I'm sure someone will post the
answer if you honestly care.  All you need to remember is that low numbers
are good, and that with the 2 numbers in the middle, if they're over zero
pray they're the same number...if not, you could very well be heading for
link dead status.

If you notice the numbers going nuts, AVOID MOVEMENT.  Oh, feel free to sit
down and stand up, but if you move at the wrong time and finally end up link
dead, even though YOU think you're over <---- there, the game may just think
you're way over ------> there, by the Sand Giant.
