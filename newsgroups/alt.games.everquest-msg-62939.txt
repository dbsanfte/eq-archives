I burn my entire DIR onto 2 cds (might take 3 eventually ;) )

Then copy it all back into a new eq folder, highlight all files and
turn off read only, start EQ, works fine. That way I only have to
patch from last time I burned the whole dir to cds (Everquest adds no
registry info or anything you need)
