Sorry for the misunderstanding then. I just meant that I've been
playing it for a year, I don't think that I gave it an entirely fair
chance. 
What I meant by it was simply that I've had it for a year, and it
didn't hold my concentration enough. I racked up 4 or 5 proper hours
on it in that year, whereas UO has about 4 or 5 hours racked up in the
past week. 

I may have been a bit harsh at the very beginning suggesting that I
was going to get rid of my account entirely. I'm going to be putting a
few more months into EverQuest, to see how it progresses, and to see
if it holds the elements that have attracted me to Ultima Online, but
I am aware there's the possibility that it simply isn't my kind of
game.
