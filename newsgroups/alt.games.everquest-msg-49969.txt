    *regrets replying even before writing*

    The question of "when does a researchable spell trivial" is mostly an
open one. Morty did some work that's linked from EQTraders, but even he
didn't narrow it down beyond a trend in the data. And given that the trend
(combines for spell level X trivial at or just above the next spell level's
maxed research skill) can't be extrapolated for a level 49 spell, the
question is a good one. I know I'd hate to blow an Ice Comet combine.
