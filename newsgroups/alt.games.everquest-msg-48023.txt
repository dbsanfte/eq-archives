Funny thing is on Druzzil Ro, about the only folks I've seen there are
Soloists.  I'm one of them, looking for those bloody Dwarf Runes, and not
having enough time  when i was younger to put a group together to get them.
But even at 30th, my occassional partner (druid) still finds some things on
tracking that are blue and yellow (Pickclaw Lord).  That, with the XP bonus
means it is still somewhat viable for him and me to kill things.  The Alloy
armor is good and very light!  A girdle drops that also adds +5 to Stamina,
a rare drop off the Lord is an alloy coif with good resists bonuses on it,
and the alloy swords - Long and Bastard - are wonders in combat at that
level.  Shoot, I was using the BABS until 38th :)
