Going with YOUR assumption that they were running due to low health
rather than being feared... you're seriously beginning to worry me.

You DO remember what snare does to a mob at low health, aka. keeps it
from running away, aka. the same as root but with the added benefit of
the mob NOT wanting to hit you back until it's dead?

Heck, with the druid rooting instead of snaring, they are MORE at risk
of chasing the mob off into something else, because it'll take off at
full speed as soon as root breaks.

If I didn't know you were of a much higher level and never group, I'd
almost wonder if this dr00d was you, since you're willing to reach so
far to try to defend her stupidity and even complain about the
intelligence of those she was grouped with.

Now, last night, a howling harpoon dropped in the group a guildie
warrior was in. The group's shaman already had the harpoon, so the
rest of the group figured they'd random alpha. Rogue in group
(guildless, wonder why?) says he's destroyed it because the shaman
couldn't use. Feel free to discuss the moral standing of the rogue; if
you take the same approach as you're taking to this druid's crowd
control methods, I'm sure you'll argue that the rogue couldn't
possibly be lying about destroying it and that what he claimed to do
was a most noble deed in the eyes of NBG.
