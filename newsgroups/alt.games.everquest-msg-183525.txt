There seems to be a cap associated with how much experience you can get 
with a kill.  I PLed my warrior through a few levels, and I accidentally 
pulled a mob that was 10-11 levels higher than I was and only got about 2 
ticks more EXP than I was getting fighting the ones 2-3 levels higher than 
I was.  I noticed this on mobs that were about 4+ levels higher than I, 
also.
