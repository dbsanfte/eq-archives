The point is, said Warrior using Rampage with an Earthshaker isn't just
standing there swinging, in which case it wouldn't matter if he was
slowed/not slowed, haste item or not. Its a one off skill that hits every
mob in a small radius around him. Each hit is considered a seperate swing.
Therefore, in this one and ONLY in this one instance really, we don't care
about the long term proc rate average, we need as many procs as we can get
RIGHT NOW. With max shaman slow, no haste item, and
Earthshaker(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=462 70 base
delay), you can get the chance to proc on each individual swing up to
80ish%. Its very much counter intuitive to the normal way of thinking about
procs, but its a very, very specialized circumstance that won't come up in
normal play ever. You have to go out of your way to set up to encounter it.
Here is the thread where a couple warriors used it to clear Plane of Fire
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=3957 . Notice the
extreme amount of work they had to go through to get it work. Its really not
worth it except as a one off toy to say "Yes, I did it".
