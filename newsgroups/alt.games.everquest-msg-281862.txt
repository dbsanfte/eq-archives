It's a lockout timer based on when you GOT the mission, assuming you
succeeded.

i.e. there's no lockout for failure, but it's applied from the time you got
the mission if you succeed.

I *think* it's 45 minutes, but that might be wrong.

In fact all of the above might be wrong, it's a while since I did LDoN
seriously enough for it to matter.
