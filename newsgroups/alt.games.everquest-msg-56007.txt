I didn't reply, never having tried an SK, so I won't say "you're welcome". 
=)

The reason you got such great replies is that you asked nicely, you didn't 
use stupid d00d speak, used complete sentences, etc..  These are the kinds 
of things the helpful people appreciate when a question is posed in this 
newsgroup.  Coincidentally, this is also how it is in the game - the nice 
people will bend over backwards to help you out if you are polite to them, 
and let them know how much you appreciate their answers / help.

If you had posted your server you play on, I would have wagered that people 
on your server in this NG would have already been offering assistance in-
game to you.

You've already gotten the advice not to beg.  That's the #1 thing to 
remember.  You will also get better responses in the game if you don't use 
shortened words like "plz".  After you learn what a "SoW" is ( hint: in EQ, 
it's not a female pig that has had piglets ), and crave a SoW all the time, 
you will get better responses with: "Excuse me dear Druid / Ranger / 
Shaman, would you possibly have the time, mana, and inclination to bestow a 
SoW upon me, please?" then if you say "SoW plz."  

I doubt you will have any problems, and will get all the help you could 
ever need if you are as nice as you seem in your post.  If you play on the 
Karana server, don't hesitate to give one of my characters a "Tell".
