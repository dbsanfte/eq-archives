How often, with the monk tank, did you end up with healing aggro? Were you 
dealing with caster mobs?(Monk gear tends to be low on resists, especially 
vs. magic) I agree that Monks were tanking a bit *too* well, but they 
should have nerfed Block or Riposte, not raw AC mitigation. As it stands 
now, pulling is much more dangerous than it was. When my monk finally 
capped 1000 AC, I saw almost no benefit.

Well, yeah, even my weak little 75% rez at 46 costs me more than CHeal, as 
does Temperance.
