I see your point here if you want the best you can get to maximize output.
A lot of the midlevel content doesn't need the best you can get to
experience it though.
Mob level and whether grouped and solo mean more than gear.
Myself being a bazaar trader shopoholic and tradeskiller has meant wearing
gear way above my level.
I have made new toons on new servers just to avoid twinking them.
Unfortunately I always break down and make a trader mule and end up twinked
in short order anyway.
I like watching prices on servers and trying to buy low and sell higher but
still undercut other traders.

However, I am more concerned that revamping zones or throwing mid levels
content will make things worse.
I lag in jagged pine. I loved the old CT zone. Nurga remains empty.

If the objective is to use only what you can loot the game will be harder
than if you twink a toon.
Mid level zones would have to drop level 60 loot to keep players on par with
those that gear up in bazaar.
If they did that in hard to get to zones I doubt any one would go there
anyway.

Sure they could make a freebie zone like they did with the warrens or
jaggedpine dropping great pp items, quests and loot.
I'd enjoy the new content but I think the results would be the same. Rarely
anyone there.
I completely understand why SOE focuses on content for those that chew it up
and devour it
I know there is a ton of content I will never see but until I use up what I
can I will keep playing.
