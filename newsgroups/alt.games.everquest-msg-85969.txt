Monkly Perspective below :)

ID works much less than 1 out of 5 times. I'd say 1 out of 8-10.

>I BELIEVE that monks are the only class with both increasable Kick skill AND Instill
>Doubt.

Here is how ID works for a Monk.......

At the end of the cycle there is a "kick" check. ALL other special
attack buttons must be "un-greyed out" when the check is made. This
means that if you use Flying Kick, Dragon Punch, Tiger Claw, ect you
have to time ID to fire off after the special attack is finished and
recycled. "IF" ID lands you will "kick" for 8pts of damage and the mob
is feared.

> And lastly, I BELIEVE that the kick at the end of ID is what
>determines if it's successful.

Yes, this is true. ID will fail every time if you do not time it
properly with the special attacks, or you are out of kicking range.

>My twink monk is languishing at level 20 or so...for the last 6 months,
>obviously I admit that I could be wrong.

Monks do not really come into their own until about level 30. You
should give your twink another shot :-)
