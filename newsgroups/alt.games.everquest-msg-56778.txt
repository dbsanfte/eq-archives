In case you were into tailoring, though "massive trade skill changes"
was already mentioned, one nice specific one to point out.... all the
tailoring components now stack. e.g. silks (as opposed to swatches)
pelts, etc.
Ok... maybe not "all" for some of the special stuff. (Will two copies of
the spell clinging darkness stack? They are used in shadow silk.) But
most stuff anyway, is now stackable. That was a big change.

Oh! And the FOOD! They changed the FOOD! The more expensive foods and
drinks (e.g. fishrolls, iron rations, ping fuzzlecutters formula, et.
al.) now actually last *significantly* longer than small, inexpensive
foods (e.g. muffins, milk) and are labeled as "hearty meals" or
"banquet" etc. so people will actually buy them from vendors, or from PC
bakers for certain items. The biggest, longest lasting food is the
marinated muskie. A couple stacks of that will actually last you through
a good number of days /played real time, and gives you some minor stat
boosts the whole time. PITA to make, high skill required and a ton of
obnoxious to gather components, but well worth it if ya have the time.
