Go farm stuff at the giant fort in Warsliks woods until you have enough to
buy the crafted BP

or else go spend a week or two sitting in Icewell Keep waiting to scavenge
up some Royal Frosted Velium (No Drop) armor
though the BP is the RARE drop and usually the people there are either
hunting dorfs for it, or someone is paying ~1k for loot rights

god I hate camping...

at least you get some velium weapons and shields scavenged, seeing as the
people hunting the dorfs aren't exactly able to go into Thurgadin to dump
the stuff on vendors....
