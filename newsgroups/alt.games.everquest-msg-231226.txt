When I was 60 I had this great idea to work on aa.  I wanted to get my
archetype title before I leveled any higher.  In retrospect this might not
have been the best idea, but I was a 60 Sage and I liked it.  I pretty much
soloed geonids in WL the entire time.  You used to be able to fear kite them
out of the cave, but since all the pathing changes the Geonids will run back
into the caves rather than out of them.  What you can do is aggro kite your
Geonid past the big rock at the entrance and then fear it and it will run
out wards.  Then just let fear wear off and have him come back to you at the
rock and fear him again.  I could kill all the way back to where the cave
splits and get back to the first repop.  About one in six spawns you will
get a shimmering geonid.  They drop unrefined gems for the 8th Coldain
Prayer Shawl.  Occasionally you will find this spot camped as people come
looking for these gems.
