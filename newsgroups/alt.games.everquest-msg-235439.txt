Even though it's the best thing we have, so far, it's clear that 
representative democracy as it stands is a thoroughly broken system. My 
biggest beef is with the "useful vote" situation, in which you cannot 
vote for whom you really want, least you split the vote and the one you 
really *don't* want comes to power. So, eventually, politics settle down 
to two-party systems and elections decided on who-fucked-who thirty 
years ago, hairstyles and campaign funds.

And then the bastards complain about voter apathy...
