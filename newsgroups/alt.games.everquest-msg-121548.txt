Well that's good, because I do too. I don't feel compassion for him
now, because, well he's dead. But I do feel sorry for him when I 
think about, as you do, what his life must have been like.

I've never defended the mother by saying she wasn't a money grubber, 
or didn't act in a manner complicitous with his death etc. I've just stated 
that none of us _know_her motives, the depth of her grief, the circumstances 
of their relationship et al. And because of that, definitive statements as to 
her character based solely upon the media reports, are premature and
conjecture.
