Just for the record, the "original adventure game" (the one with XYZZY)
wasn't from MIT.  It started with Will Crowther at BBN (a networking
company in Massachusetts), and the version that most people know is the
one I derived from his in the late 70s while I was a student at Stanford.
Stanford and MIT did have a lot of interaction across the ARPAnet (early
version of the Internet), so I did set up a copy there for people to play.
It wasn't long, though, before people had ported copies to all sorts of
machines.

Zork, on the other hand, was indeed developed at MIT, by some students
who were inspired by my Adventure game.

I've never considered myself the "father of computer games", but have
sometimes been called the "father of computer adventure games".
