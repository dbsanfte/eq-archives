I'm guessing you don't look like the models in EQ. I figure that's a
safe assumption because real, human women don't. That proportion of
breasts to waist has got to be hell on the lower back if it doesn't
just snap you in half.

The reason that I bring this up is to suggest that men, particularly
husbands, generally do not tell the truth to women regarding what they
think about female physical archetypes, particularly to women who
don't share that archetype.

"Oh, no, honey. Large, firm, round, firm breasts, curves, tiny waists.
Disgusting."

Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft, Liv Tyler as Arwen, the entire Gene
Rodenberry pantheon, and about a dozen more names spring forth as
examples of the closest human equivilent of the female EQ models being
used to appeal to male geeks.

Please apologize in advance to your husband for me for the pointless
fight that I just started.
