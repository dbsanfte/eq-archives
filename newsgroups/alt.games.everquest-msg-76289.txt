Hm... I'll try to make this easy and clear: EQ is intended to be a
role-playing game set in a fantasy environment. Within the constrains
placed by the milieu, you can choose for yourself a witty or in-jokey
name that blends well with the environment (like the name of a minor
character in a relatively obscure fantasy novel), or you can have a name
that sticks out like a sore thumb (like Gannnddallllfffff). *Those*
bother me, and I'm probably not alone, if Verant has had a policy
regarding inapropriate names from day one, even if they aren't very
consistent when it comes to enforcing it. 

I'll give you an example: If I were reading "The Lord of the Rings" and
Farmer Maggot were actually called Farmer Noshroomsferjoo, it would
diminish my enjoyment of the book a great deal. Well, *almost* the same
with EQ.

No, because generally I know what I can expect from a dictionary. On the
other hand, if I bought a dictionary that, due to some malicious
printer, contained a page taken from some hardcore gay BDSM magazine,
I'll certainly rip that page out.

> Relax. You'll live longer and have more time to play EQ.

I'm certainly a lot less bothered by names in EQ than you seem to be
about my attitude to them. I suggest you take some of your own advice
and relax a bit.
