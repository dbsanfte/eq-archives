Exactly. You have the right to work and earn money, however, as with
any right, the limit of that right is where it treads on someone
else's rights. SOE has the right to control what is done with their
property AND what types of activities are conducted on their servers.
I can't set up a home business in my apartment without the permission
of my landlord. I couldn't set up a lemonade stand outside the front
door of the Safeway down the street without the manager's permission.
Conducting a business on SOE's servers is no different. ( And, yes,
IGE and such do conduct their business in part on SOE's servers )

Furthermore, city zoning codes can forbid me from running a certain
type of business even if I do own the property.

There is also the argument that I bring up every time: The sellers
don't own the items their selling, and they are expressly forbidden by
those that do own those items to sell them.

A person's right to work and earn money does **NOT** mean they can do
that wherever they feel like it.
