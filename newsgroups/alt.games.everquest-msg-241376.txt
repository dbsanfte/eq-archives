This is the exact card I bought yesterday.  Since I was changing from a
Savage PRO, I had to change my BIOS, (more than once because after I loaded
the new drivers it reset the old card for some reason), but after that I was
playing again last night!  It is a big download, and you need to follow the
instructions, save to a file and then install not open from the page, and
everything works GREAT!
