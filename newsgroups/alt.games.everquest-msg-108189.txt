Maybe thats why there are so many peeps running around who have no idea how
to group.
I think you should always give someone a second chance. You should try
giving someone the benefit of your experience. Advice is what makes someone
a better player, either in-game or by research on websites (or newsgroups).
The EQ manual gives no instructions on how to group. Remember, you were all
newbies at one time, no one was born with a full instinctive knowledge of EQ
grouping! In saying that, it does seem like mrtaxi was grouped with someone
with a reasonably low amount of common sense.


Flame me at your peril :P
