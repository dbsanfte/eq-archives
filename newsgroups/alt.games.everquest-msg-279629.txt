You don't worry about the wanderers and charge ahead to the next static, or
without a decent puller, two statics sometimes.  If you get into the garden
quickly you can skip a good portion of wandering drakes.

More content-skipping tips, with a good puller you can skip a great deal at
the end as well.  For monks, rogues and bards only, necros and SKs if you're
lucky...  you can kill the 3 thingies, then pull the big guy out to
somewhere near your group and do a memwipe and tag yourself or get a tag. 
For some classes this is a one-shot deal, so no screwing up allowed (this is
my 3-boxing experience talking).  =) You need invis and/or a good knowledge
of sneak, depending on what's in the way, and a clean FD or somebody else
tanking and a good tagger.  Can do that to the last two bosses if you have a
good setup, but can skip more with second to last.
