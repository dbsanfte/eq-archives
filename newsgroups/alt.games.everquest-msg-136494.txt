I missed the level 44 AoE stun.

Because of resists, you want two chanters stunning.  They need to cycle
through their stuns because of recast time.  So if they only have two stuns,
you will have time that is covered by only one enchanters stun, so it gets
risky due to resists.  The stuns each have a 12 second recast time, but, you
can cast a different stun while that recast time is ticking away.  With 3
stuns to cycle through you get complete coverage, and the mobs should,
barring resisting both enchanters, be stun locked, and unable to do
anything. The Wizards chain cast PB AoEs, switching between two different
ones I think, for the same reason as the enchanters, the recast time.  You
want to mobs to go down as fast as possible, so that there is less chance of
enough resisting the stuns enough to stop the chain stunning.  With only two
stuns prior to level 44, it is riskier, as then there is time that only one
enchanter is covering the stuns.  It also needs to be timed more carefully,
as the enchanters must try to overlap their stuns such that the mobs are all
stun locked.

Then enchanter stun line, according to casters realm is:
Level 4 - 1 second cast, 4 second duration, 12 second recast.
Level 20 - 1.5 second cast, 6 second duration, 12 second recast.
Level 44 - 2 second cast, 8 second duration, 12 second recast.
Level 52 - 1.5 second cast, 8 second duration, 12 second recast.

So, at level 20+, one enchanter can only keep mobs stunned for 10 seconds,
leaving 2 more seconds on the recast, plus 1 second cast time minimum.
That's with alternating his stuns.  With two enchanters, timing it
carefully, and no resists, the mobs can be kept stun locked at level 20+.
At level 44 is when a single enchanter without resists can keep all the mobs
stun locked indefinately (well, until mana runs out), with the second
enchanter added, both chain casting 3 stuns, the probability goes up
significantly that the mobs will remain stun locked, as then the same mob
needs to resist two stuns in order to do anything.
