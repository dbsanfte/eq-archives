Errr... Ummm... Damn... N&B kinda IS the hardest one, as far
as I'm concerned, so I'll have to pass. A winner is you!

Think that was included on one of the Lost Treasures releases,
but I'm not 100% sure. BTW, wanna hear a sad story? Years ago,
I loaned a friend all my Infocom games, and then he moved, and
I've never seen them since! Waaaah! All my originals, complete
with the cool stuff like postcards, peril-sensitive sunglasses
and stuff like that, gone forever! A loser is me!

(Rune hits Google, pokes around a bit. Hey, first hit has all
the info I need!)

N&B was included on LToI volume II, so poke around a bit and
see if you can find it for sale somewhere!
