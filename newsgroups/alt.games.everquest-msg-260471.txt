.....I have been known to lament that there isn't a decaff version, so I
can have the flavour without being worried that I'll be up till 3 am.
But it took a while to grow on me.  My enjoyment of the flavour might be
pschological.

Oh, and the version they have over in Europe, which was banned in the
USA...it tastes even better. And makes you less jittery while at the same
time keeping you awake longer. Or so it did to me.  Makes me curious why
they banned it.....
