Maybe so, but considering I have seen the little bastard up on track, it's
not inconcievable that someone was kiting him around waiting for the raid to
prep so that he wouldn't path into the iksar master.

BTW, have a tracker go out toward the firepots and run up to the chessboard
from there before you spawn Fay, if the 'real' one is up, handing in the
froglok essence makes the dwarf poof (you still get essence back) but no Fay
spawns.
