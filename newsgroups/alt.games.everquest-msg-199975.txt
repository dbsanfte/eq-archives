Ah, ok so basically they are kind of doing stuff with the UI to make
it more "console type" mmorpg like with nested menus and junk. 

This is a pretty darn cool idea, though I wonder if it will
actually be faster on my 56 druid when its memming one of the spells
on the first two pages which it uses a lot? I guess it would be fast
for ones I have towards the back, though.
