Hi NG,

can anybody tell me a good place for a Level 54 Mage to play solo?

And i have some questions:

I started my Mage about 2 Years ago and changed to Bard.

Now i want to play the Mage again, so i have some question:

1. Is it good to give your Pet summond amour?
2. What buffs do u use for soling on your pet?

Thanks a lot!
Joerg
