>>> So, does anyone have some useful suggestions on how to fix my faction so
I can walk around in Highpass <<<

Kill Chief Gan'Shralok in Kithicor Forest. He sits in the SW corner of the
zone, and you can camp him untouched (never saw any undead near him, even in
the blackest of night). He is either 19 or 20, a shaman, and gives you an
amazing hit for HH guards.

I went from 18 to 20 killing just him, and I went from dubious to ally on
those two levels.

He's on a 6 minute spawn, so you could go around and kill the other Shralok
Orcs (Captain, C'Habrel, Wrek, Bashil, Curker, can you tell I've spent some
time with these boys?) to help speed up the process. Just remember that the
orcs in HHP are on the Shralok faction also.
