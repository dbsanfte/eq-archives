Aye, I could have done that, but that would mean running all the way to 
vendors and back, I'm pretty sure this would have eaten more time than I 
lost by running a little slower chasing mobs.  I was cheating here to 
maximize the one hour profit; I didn't count travel time, buffing time, 
getting out and selling after time; the "hour" I spent actually took 
more like an hour fifteen minutes when all was said and done.

Something I've seen in the past were people who ran an ATM business; 
someone with port would come in with pockets full of pp and trade it for 
smaller change for a fee.  They then gate to a bank and dump the change 
back into plat and repeat.  Doing the same thing with a known commodity 
like peridot would be even better; sell em at 11pp each, buyer can get 
almost 10pp back for em but they weight almost nothing.

Me, I'd rather farm somewhere where the principle drops are diamonds, 
and cut out the middleman.
