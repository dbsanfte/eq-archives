OK, my Usenet feed is now Officialy Broken, as this post
arrived here today, sat. 8th. And not just this post has
been massively delayed, I've been seeing lots of followups
without the original posts ever arriving... This sucks.

Luckily, I remembered your wedding day as the first Sunday
in September, so I was there and had a good time to boot =p

Rune, who thinks Lenny is cool
