100% agreement here.  As much as I love my BL, they should
never have been introduced.  As for berserkers, I'm not sure
what the point of another sub-par DPS class with limited 
utility was.

It's probably not going to matter to me after the 14th, however.
I'm on hiatus until I see how OoW shapes up, at which point I'll
decide whether to make my retirement permanent.  From the information
available now, I very much doubt OoW is bringing me back.
