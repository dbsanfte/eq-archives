Finally had a chance to spend some time in PoV last night.  The XP rocked, 
sort of like my first time in tier 1 zones.  I had very little trouble 
slowing mobs, 10% or so resisted first attempt to slow.  Most of the mobs 
were white to yellow to me.  I did not feel out of place at my level, only 
times we stopped were when several people AFKed.  Was at the eastern wall 
camp.  Did spend a bit of time at the outer cave two days ago as well.
