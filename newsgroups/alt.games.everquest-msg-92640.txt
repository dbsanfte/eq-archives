Hi all,

I am going to buy Luclin today. Just wondering if anyone has any advice or
anything. I will be running it on a 750MhZ, 384 megs of RAM, and a Voodoo3
3000 card. I am assuming all I need to do is install and away I go. If
anyone has any thoughts or experiences they would like to share about when
they upgraded to Luclin that think would apply to me I would love to hear
them.

Thanks
