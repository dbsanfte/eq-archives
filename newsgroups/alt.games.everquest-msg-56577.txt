Alright, quick question for any who play on TZ and happen to know the
prices.

I'm a level 16 Dark Elf Necro on TZ, about to ding to 17, and I've been
considering trying to upgrade the equipment I've got. For reference, I've
got a few raw silk pieces, a Robe of Enshroudment, a Dagger of Dropping, a
Mystic Doll, a Bloodstone ring (+2 INT, +5 Mana), one Cutthroat Insignia
ring, and an Electrum Hematite choker (+7 SV FIRE).

Not exactly something to strike fear into the hearts of the enemy. Now, I'm
looking to upgrade my equipment; trouble is, I'm fairly poor, with only a
few platinum pieces to my name. So I need any help you can give me with two
things.

A) How to make money on Tallon Zek as a Dark Elf Necro (Level 16).
Tailoring, cooking, whatever it is, I'll do it. I hate being poor.

B) What kind of equipment should I be looking at at my level? I want to get
some +INT equipment, since I stupidly didn't put my INT as high as it could
go (3 points off the total). It really doesn't matter, though, I will take
anything I can afford that's better than what I've got.

Thanks in advance for the help.

One note : I don't want to beg off other players. I hated it when people
used to do it to my Druid on Karana, and I wouldn't subject anyone else to
it.

16th DE Necro, TZ
