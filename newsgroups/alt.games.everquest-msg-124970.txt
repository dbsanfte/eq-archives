Noted... but I really hate those jerks over on the MagicRules group :o)
Note Subject Line change ;o)

And? Removing all the Off-Topic posts in this group would cut the traffic by
about 50% ;o)

He asked... I asked... we were both polite... so what's the problem? He's
entitled to ask if he wants to... I'm entitled to ignore and continue if I
want to... he's entitled to killfile me if he wants to... no
flames/abuse/insults were exchanged. I think that's pretty good behaviour by
Usenet standards ;oD

Heheh... and there's never been a flame war on AGE???

But seriously... my post aimed to tighten up some of the science, and give a
couple more examples of how it can be used to refute the Creationist
argument of the Earth only being 10,000 or so years old... and in closing,
pointed out the futility of any Logic-vs-Faith debate as two intractable
positions that can, by definition, never be reconciled. Science requires
proof, and proof denies Faith... mutually exclusive ideaologies (sp?).
It was never meant to prolong such a debate. I did express on which side my
own opinion rested, but acknowledged the validity of a persons right to his
or her own beliefs, that I recognised my own position would probably not
sway another from their own position, and that further debate would be
fruitless.

Well... this HAS been the longest thread on AGE all week... so we can't ALL
be insane? (And if we ARE all insane, that'd still put us in the majority...
meaning we're the sane ones, and those who disagree aren't)

Not so far... but please continue...

Interesting point... but if I'm a lurker on RGTMagicRules, as well as a
regular poster on AGE... is it really cross-posting? If I'm spamming myself,
who do I send the 'abuse' report to... my Mom?... and if it IS self-abuse...
will I go blind?? :o)

Well... the reply was to a post that was cross-posted... so I was replying
via all the newsgroups where the thread to that point had been posted. In
the past, I have removed cross-posting in my own replies... but in this
case, I didn't see it as appropriate. Yes, needless cross-posting is bad
"netiquette"... relevant cross-posting isn't.

Didn't want your smelly ol' stuff, anyway *sniff*

>And I recently quit, too...
Which means, from your current standpoint, everything posted in AGE is "Off
Topic"... because you no longer play EQ ;o)
