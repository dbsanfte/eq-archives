Is this a troll?

It has that 'shaggy dog' story feel to it.

But - yes.

Everyone hates 'chanters'. They are useless in groups and have no usefull
spells or buffs. Especially as you get into tougher dungeons where wandering
mobs jump into alrready precarious fights. Enchanters feel like they have to
keep things 'mezzed' and that people should 'assist' a main attacker. How
stupid is that? Everyone knows that if each group member takes on one
attacker the fight will be over that much faster!

Don't get me started on Clerics and their sit-on-my-butt the entire fight
routine...

without a Druid is doomed from the start!
