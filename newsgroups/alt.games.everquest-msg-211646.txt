Wow.  This is an incredible thread!  MY belief and opinion is simply this:
For those touting religion for their argument, God (or whatever name you put
to your supreme being) created the heavens and earth.  Created you and I.
To say that homosexuals are an abomination is to degrade God's work.  Second
guessing the master could get you fired (and brimstoned).  Ouch.

For those using biology, if homosexuality is happening, it's natural.  There
is no right or wrong, no moral issue.

But, for those of you who are big enough people to keep your noses out of
everyone else's bedroom or bath house, I applaud you!  And remember, these
are my opinions.

Ok.  Fire away!
