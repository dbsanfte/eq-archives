Killing Ixi for a guildmate today, he asked me to come with him to the 
trigger spot in case of adds.  Good thing I did cause the trigger wasn't 
up at 4 am, even though both of us had walkthru's that said 6pm to 6am.

Someone else had said trigger spawn time was 7 am.  No trigger.

Lots of aggros though, which gave us something to do.  Raid was busy 
buffing up and killing their own adds (for some reason they elected to 
kill at Ixi spawn site, instead of the traditional pull to SF zone.)

Eventually, at 10 am, Naxot spawned.  Raid cleaned up their area and 
their act (short term buffs, FM, etc) and we handed in, ran back, 
stopping to refresh SOW via potion cause we'd been out so long our Billy 
faded, and arrived just in time to see Ixi die, not taking a single AOE 
or striking a single blow or casting a single heal or nuke.

Which, I'd say, is a good reason for the pull to SF zone line, let the 
cleric participate in his own damn kill!

Anyway, was all smooth enough, but Naxot spawn time was sure weird, did 
they move it or is it a bug or what?
