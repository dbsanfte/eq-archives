If it ever did work like that it will have been fixed long ago.
The above example gives (I think) an extra 6% exp. Not very much, but
if you take it to the extreme it is.

Imagine the lvl 55 grouped with 5 lvl 1 characters. That would mean
the lvl 55 would get ~93% of 180% exp. I.e. 167% of normal exp.


Can you see SoE leaving that exploit open?
...errr, actually forget I said that. Anybody care to test it out?
