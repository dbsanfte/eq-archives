We can mitigage "good enough" in many cases, but as good as, or better than,
a warrior?  Sorry Im still not buying it.

Not just in terms of using defensive either.. an example from the top of my
head...  Kromzek warlords in the 10th ring war (the final wave "bosses").
Not exactly a mob where you need to use defensive, but they rip my monk
apart wheras guild warriors fair much better.

Stuff like Velk spiders?  Well lets be honest their dmg output is shit
anyway, and hardly matters in the grand scheme of things.

Well I think AE taunt went a long way in helping warriors (raid level
anyway).. make it a faster recycle?

Fixing the AC cap, fixing taunt (make it 20% better for warriors?).. those
kind of changes i can agree with.   Boosting your dps to better compete
versus a monk though?  sorry, /veto

Recent discussion on my servers boards...  the person with the most AA on
prexus is a ranger.  Can't solo huh? :)
