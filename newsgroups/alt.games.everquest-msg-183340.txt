There is an in game gamma setting.  Froglocks, IIRC, have infravision, so
you should be able to see fine, even at night, once you adjust the in game
gamma.  There is a button on the window selector bar for game options.  One
of the tabs is for the display.  Adjust the display properties until you get
the look you like.

Cheers,
Eric
