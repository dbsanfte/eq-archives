Haha.  For those who weren't playing back then, here's a summary of
what he is referring to.

Originally, the Fungi Tunic and the Robe of the Living Fungus (and I
think a couple of other items) all had Fungal effects (I don't recall
if they had the same effect).

One day, everyone with a Robe of the Living Fungus noticed that the
effect was gone, and they complained about the unannounced nerf.

Verant's response: we have no idea what you are talking about, because
the Robe of the Living Fungus *NEVER* had any effect on it!

Player's response: oh yes it did!

Verant's response: you are all nuts.  The designer of the item says he
never put an effect on it.  There's no way we would put Fungal
Whatever on Robe of the Living Fungus...it would be totally
overpowering, and if by some weird glitch, one or two of you had that,
you should have known it was overpowering and a mistake and expected
it to go away (yeah...when every other item in the "Fungus" line had a
Fungal effect...players should be surprised that the Robe of the
Living Fungus has a Fungal effect).  Anyway, we still don't believe
that it had an effect, but if it did, it was some weird data
corruption when we exported the item data, and won't be restored.

Player's response: you are stupid and/or lying.

Verant's response: (nothing)
