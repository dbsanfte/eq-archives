Alas that they did, in fact, fuck the patch up.  Some people are
getting some pretty annoying graphics bugs, even though they have
DirectX 9 and the latest graphics drivers.  Since I'm currently
apparently unable to connect to anything in the US, I don't know
whether this will affect me, but it happened to a friend and several
people in his guild.

Of course, this being on Windows, it could be something else that's
screwed up and they just need to reinstall.

But yes, the sky is great (it worked on his other computer).
