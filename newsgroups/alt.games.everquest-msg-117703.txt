Yes, I believe that he did, if I am correct.
If I am in correct, then what I believe may
be wrong. I believe that Microsoft created the
earth in 6 days, then released a patch on the
seventh day. If what I believe is in opposition
to what you believe, then possibly our views are
opposing, or are they? If you looked at then in
a mirror, would they still be different? What if, one
day, you were driving along the freeway, and suddenly,
while you were going really fast, you jumped out of the car,
and ran in front of it.What if, one evening you were reading through
the newsgroups, thinking it was the daily newspaper.
What if a terrorist drove the plane into the building, but he
didn't mean to because he was blind, and couldn't see that
the buildings were there.Would God forgive him? How do you
know it was a he? Maybe it wasn't? What is Bill Gates was God?
What if Bill Gates drove a plane into the building? Would everybody
still buy Microsoft Windows XP. What about Office XP? Would
everyone still play Solitaire? Would people still go to Church on Sunday?
Maybe they would pray to Allah? OK, I hope I answered your question.
Good luck.
NOTE: Microsoft, Windows XP, Office XP, Solitaire, Church, Sunday, Allah,
etc. are either registered trademarks or trademarks or Microsoft Corporation
in Afghanistan and/or other countries. But not China, because they are
communists. Blemish.
