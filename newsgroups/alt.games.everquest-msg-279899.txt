Couple things:
-As everyone else pointed out, charisma has no effect.  Take your
friend's advice with a grain of salt.
-The level of the spell has no effect on how well it is resisted.  Each
spell has its own resist check, however almost all darkness spells have
exactly the same resist check.  Every spell from Clinging Darkness
through Devouring Darkness has exactly the same chance of landing on
any particular mob.  However the last two necro snares have a -20
resist check.  They are slightly easier to land than all the other
Darkness spells.
-I recommend that when kiting dangerous mobs, you keep two snares up.
If you have Embracing Darkness yet, pull with it (otherwise use Dooming
Darkness).  However if the mob resists or if you let snare wear off,
its nice to have a backup, fast-casting snare.  In many cases, the time
between when the mob gets in casting range and when he starts hitting
you is almost the same as the casting time of your snares--you barely
have enough time to cast snare before you need to run away again.
Engulfing Darkness casts much faster than most of the other Darkness
spells and it will slow the mob down enough to get things back under
control.  It lasts just under a minute, which gives you time to cast
your regular snare on it several times on a now-slower-moving mob.
Keeping Engulfing Darkness up is also a great backup agro-getter.  If
your pet grabs agro from you while kiting, cast Engulfing a few times
(even if resisted or a better snare is on the mob already) and the mob
will want you again.
-Your debuff spells have no effect on your snares.  They only debuff
fire, disease, and poison.  Your snare is a magic-based spell.

In fact you should try to be as far away as possible so that if it is
resisted you have more distance between you and it.

Your 63 and 68 Darkness spells are your best bet, because they have a
slightly better resist check.  There isn't much else you can do to make
the mob resist you less other than fighting lower-level mobs, mobs with
lower resists, or having a Mage, Enchanter, or Shaman debuff them for
you.  If you can hone your kiting skills, you will find that resists
aren't that big of a deal anyway.  Recast your snare several tics
before it is scheduled to expire.  Work on the stop, turn, cast method
others desribed to get a spell off ASAP while kiting.  Things like that
will make resisted snares a less problematic issue in most cases.
