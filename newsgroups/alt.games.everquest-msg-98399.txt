Nah, I'd rather them have one big patch and if necessary spend a day
or so fixing what went wrong. It would suck if the servers were down
an hour or so every day for weeks at a time. During the Luclin launch
they patched every single day for an entire week, and everyone who was
on European/Asian/Australian time hated it, along with those Americans
who like to stay up late or play way early. You couldn't schedule late
night/early morning raids or anything. Not everyone who plays EQ does
so during daylight hours US. So for a lot of people, one day with lots
of downtime is better than lots of days with little downtime.
