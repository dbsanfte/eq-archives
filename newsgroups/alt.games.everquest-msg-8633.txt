I have worked my way up to a whopping 12th lvl bard, and I've read the "Revised
and Expanded" manual.    I have yet to see one reason for having mana yet I
have it and can meditate.  I can't see any spell that does damage at low levels
other than perhaps Chords of Dissonance and I got in trouble with fellow
players for playing the tune in BB (the gnoll caverns).  Seems I lit up
everyone elses prey and even the PCs.  I was told to stop using it or be
petitioned for KSing.  I petitioned a guide to understand the problem, and was
told it best not to play that tune around others - ok.  The instruments are
suppose to help teh spells work better I believe, but I'm told a special drum
can make you run faster that a store bought one.  Where is all that
information?  Why do we have mana?   

Any help you can give me on running the bard would be very appreciated.

Thanks
