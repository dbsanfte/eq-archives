Sure you can do it that way still.

But the new way is categorically better. It allows the main tank to 
manage aggro much better, by letting him see mob ping-pong *much* better 
(and where its going), all without having to untarget the mob.

It allows the healer to monitor the mobs health rate, without having to 
untarget the tank.

It allows cc classes to see where a mob is going.

It allows FD classes to determine if they still have aggro quicker and 
easier.

Yes, the 'old' way still exists. But its been supplanted and largely 
superceded by the new way. Much like the new tradeskill interface, 
really.
