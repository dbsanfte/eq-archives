Alteration is where the vast majority of your spells lie. conjuration is
important for mezzes.

Intellectual Advancement/Superiority should reduce the number of fizzles you
cast. Especially useful when working on skills to keep it up.

Additional spells to consider adding to your lineup of buffs:
Illusion: Barbarian. Doesn't affect your vision any as a big forehead on
campus man, and gives you slam. Those little half second stuns help from
time to time.
Keep the chr buff up if you are charming. If not, it's loot sale time only
most likely

My spell list at 17 would be:
1. Buff swap spot/sooth for pulling
2. color flux
3. slow
4. haste
5. root
6. mez (What? Mez? I always have it memmed)
7. DoT
8. Whirl till you hurl (not great, but better than the nuke imho, especially
at your evocation skill)

or Charm Solo:
1. Buff swap spot/sooth for pulling
2. color flux
3. slow
4. haste
5. root
6. mez (What? Mez? I always have it memmed)
7. DoT
8. Charm

Spells to add at 20:
Berseker Strength: Like rune, but no component (researched, so you will have
to putter with that or buy it in the bazaar)
Illusion Troll: 1 whole measly hp of Regen
Color shift: The next PBAE stun. it should supplement Color Flux, not
replace it. With the two together you are approaching stun lock ability.

special note for 24: Sagar's animation is the first one to be able to dual
wield. With that, Alacrity, and Tepid deeds, you'll find your last big leap
in pet capability.

I get home after using OE and IE all day at work, and pull up Netscape and
it makes me feel all fuzzy.
