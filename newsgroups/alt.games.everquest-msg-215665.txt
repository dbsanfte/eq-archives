I haven't been on much since the LDoN patch (not related...just on a rest
after pushing to 60....was 54 for 12 months, 55 for 9 months, 56, 57, 58,
and 59 for 10 days each (solo Wizard)), but haven't seen any problem the
times I'm on.  My routine when I've been on lately has been to check PoD,
and if flies are not open, check SD and see if there are any blue Tro Jeg
up, and if not, go to Katta and see if any of Nathyn's guards are blue and
if so, kill them until only light blue ones are up, and then go to the Nexus
and Bazaar, and then back to PoK, PoT, and camp in PoD if the flies aren't
open, so I am doing a fair amount of zoning, so if there were a 50%, I'd be
hitting it, and I'm not.

However, a couple guys at work have both complained of lots of LD recently.
I don't know if it was during zoning or not.  They both play on Fennin Ro,
and tell me they've heard lots of others complaining about the problem.

I've NOT heard any complaints on The Nameless.  Could be only affecting some
servers, perhaps?
