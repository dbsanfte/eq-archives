That would be correct under this definition... but as with most
things, definitions evolve... I know most people refer to the Cleric
Hammer as a pet, as well as the Enchanter's pet, a pet.   as well as
the Wizards Familiar.

I personally think what makes a pet, is one that can fight for you..
not necessarily one you can control... so that would exclude the
Wizard pet, which is more or less just a buff.

But, that's me opinions...
