/em pitches this post into the wastebasket with all the other "I'm mad
because I don't have the abilities all the other classes have..."
rants.

You want Feign Death? Play a necro or monk. You want Backstab? Play a
rogue. You want Mana Burn? Play a wizard. You want mana regen spells?
Play a bard or chanter.

You want ports? Play a druid or a wizard.

It's all completely up to you.

Rumble <--- plays nearly all classes/races and likes them pretty much
as they are
