HI All;

I made a priest character with the goal of being a cleric.  At level 10 I 
chose the "..path of a cleric.." for the first class division. The other 
choices were Shammy or a Druid.  At level 18 the only choice I have is 
"...the path of a Templar..".  I keep reading the book trying to understand 
these two milestones in a characters life.  I must be missing or 
misunderstanding something.  At level 18 "...the path of a Templar.." is the 
only choice.  I thought that there would be some other type of choice to 
make. If there's not, why have a level 20 milestone for a character?  The 
only other choice in the book is Inquisitor which appears to be evil.  It 
seems that at level 20 I have no other choice ( I don't know what it would 
be anyway).  So, to me, it looks like it would be "life as usual" when I hit 
level 20 with no choice to make, it seems I just simply keep going being a 
cleric.

Please explain what it is I'm missing or misunderstanding besides not being 
too bright....

Thanks in advance for your time and help.

Happy Holidays to All

Doctorzoid
