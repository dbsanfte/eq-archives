In CC don't do geos, do the orcs. You can kill them easier and
the frozen swords are great loot. Keep the stackable velium
to sell to tailor players. Sell the bricks. Foreman Orcs almost
always have a frozen sword.

I hope you have invested in some good charisma gear to sell with.
Get your charisma over 105 for the best prices most places. These
charisma items will pay for themselves.

Another option is runnyeye, there is a banker and merchants in there
that wont attack you so you can sell and bank their just like runnyeye.
Loot isn't as good as CC but its not usually as camped as CC is. You
can sell some Black alloy pieces in auction if you want to stuff some
in your bank for later.
