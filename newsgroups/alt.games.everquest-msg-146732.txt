The one you are leaving out is the Ulthorks in Eastern wastes. Hands
down the best quadding at 44, IMO. The walrus will still all be giving
some xp, albeit light blue for most, and basically all of the hunters
and warriors are dark blue. Loot is fair, plus every four tusks can be
turned in to the chief in CS for a random gem up to and including a Blue
Diamond. Great xp and good loot to boot. I miss that stage of quadding.
