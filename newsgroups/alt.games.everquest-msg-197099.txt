Just for the record I did not buy this character from ebay nor someone
gave to me I started at zero.  And further more  and did not know
about KEI till lvl 33.  I found out bout KEI from a fellow player.
Did not know what is was.  I think that i did a good job on Druid by
myself .  One thing I dont like about the game is people think they
are Gods and there feces dont stink.  I like the game to relax, but
would like to know the logic.  Is the so bad?  Got a friend  65 Cleric
that lost his house, job and was paying real money for plat.  When POP
came out , took him less than 2 weeks to get the "flags" (Never been
there yet)
I also have not done any quests nor belong to any  Guild and I buy my
own equip. with the resources allowed.  I have an 20 war that someone
on Xegony has given me hand me downs and offered to pay and player
refused.  One night the same player buffed me up and told him not to
waste mana on me since I was dead.  He took the time for over 3 hours
to help me find my corpse.  He did not  want any money for his time.
He was just happy to help.  THIS experience 1 in a THOUSAND.
I also believe that people who Twink should buy their characters from
ebay or somewhere else.  If  I need help from any of you would you
help someone in need ?  I think I know the answer to that one.  EQ is
a nice game and if grouped a GREAT game.

Sorry spoke my peace Tired of hearing that I bought this character

Happy Hunting, Be Safe and HAVE FUN
