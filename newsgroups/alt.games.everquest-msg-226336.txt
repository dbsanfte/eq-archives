I don't know why you think the issues have *anything* to do with the 
amount and availability of 'open public beta' slots. They do not.

SOE is selling access to a beta. Period. The 'lotto' notwithstanding.
Worse SOE is selling that access by bundling it to a product the average 
  EQ1 player has minimal to no interest in.

Suppose this was a 2-disc X-Men2 dealie. With X2 'the movie', and then 
'the making of x2 bonus disk'. Now normally we expect to get them 
together... we buy the right edition of X2 and we get the bonus disc. 
And all is fine. [e.g. If they were giving these beta slots to people 
who pre-ordered EQ2 I wouldn't have a complaint.]

SOE however has decided to sell X2 the movie by itself, and give away a 
  limited stack of bonus discs via a draw... which is still ok. But 
then...they bundle the 'making of X2 bonus disc' with 'Mighty Morphin 
Power Rangers: The Movie'. So if I want to ensure I get to see the 
'making of' I have to fork out full price for a piece of crap I've got 
no interest in seeing.

Clever marketing or not that is just abusing your customers.
