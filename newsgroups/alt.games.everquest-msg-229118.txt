Unrest has undead, and got one of my characters from 24 to 28 or so. 
I couldn't stand HHK, and it wasn't even that crowded compared to how
I hear it used to be.  I'm not a cleric, although I was always grouped
with one when I was there...duoing usually.  Go in the back entrace
and up the back set of stairs, those are where the mobs you'll want to
be fighting are.  And it's considered an outside zone, like HHK, so if
your twink has a horse you can summon it there.

I like Dawnshroud, but I think it's probably better to start around
28, unless you have a pretty large and strong group, I suppose.  Not
that I have a whole lot of experience to speak from, but lately I've
been doing either DSP or LDoN so that's what I know.

Game on,
