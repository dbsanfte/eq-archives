Uh... this does nothing more for low levels than it does for high
levels.  It's extremely good of course, but our guild is piled with
people under level 40 and we've raided Najena, Befallen, Runnyeye,
Crushbone, and I can't even remember where else.  There are raids for
higher levels as well, but our guild leader is very good at making
sure everybody feels like they're getting something out of being in
that guild.
