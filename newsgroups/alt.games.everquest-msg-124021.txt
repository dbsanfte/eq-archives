I run with maximum view distance and all luclin models
*all* the time. Only time it ever gets choppy is in the
zone in room in TOV  (dont ask me why - its fine in other
parts of TOV). For raids I turn off player names, spell
effects and sky, but otherwise everything remains maximum
settings, high resolution tectures, etc.

My system is an AMD XP1800, 512Mb 2100 ram (not as good as
the stuff you list, I think... not sure though) and a GeForce
3 ti500... I figure your system should fly ;)
