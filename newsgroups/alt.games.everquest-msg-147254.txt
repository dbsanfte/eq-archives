I have all the chitchat, auction, ooc, shout, most channels go to one chat
window.  When I go into the bazaar, I don't even look at it, I use /bazaar,
and find what I am looking for, and leave.  If I am there to sell, I am not
at my computer, so it really doesn't matter what is being said in any
channels.

I have never noticed any gambling going on in the bazaar, but then, it is
unlikely I ever would, even if it was going on.
