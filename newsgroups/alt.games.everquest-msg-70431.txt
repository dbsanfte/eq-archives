And now that I think of it....there's not realy a point(in most cases) of
even buying 98....just buy XP...
Especially, if you can't find 98 for less the $70-$100.....

Someone can try to sue anyone at anytime for any reason(USA)....So, I'm just
saying,IMHO, in this case, it's a waste of time...
If the people(like the petitioner guy) spent as much time and effort working
towards upgrading their machine instead of bitching and moaning, they'd have
the fastest machines available....

Ok, I have a p2 350, 256 meg,tnt2, winxp machine that seems to play old
world eq...not great but it's playable....
Do you have something older? or are still having problems??There's lots of
good tweak web sites around...

Hmm, that's a valid point....Money(affordability) I'm assuming is the
greatest reason for staying with Win95...

I agree with this...but I think the chance is extremely slim....
