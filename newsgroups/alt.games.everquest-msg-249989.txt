I just deleted the jaggedpine* files and that seems to have fixed it
although it looks more like a driver/dx9 issue. I've seen it happen on
multiple pc's including one i reformatted and tried a different OS on.  The
proposed solution to the DX9 problem seems to be essentially to stop using
dx9. ("HardwareTnL=FALSE ...VertexShaders=FALSE")

I have to admit the following made me laugh:
"8) Stop using 3rd party client programs or parsing programs.

Programs such as EQWindows and EQPlayNice, and parsing programs are not
supported by EverQuest and may lead to errors. If you are using any 3rd
party program or utility to assist you in playing EverQuest, please
uninstall or stop using this software now. "



Umm,  so sony thinks parsing programs will cause DX9 issues? Ooookkkaaay.
And daylight savings causes the curtains to fade. I can understand them
saying "if you get problems when using 3rd party products, that go away when
you don't use them, then it's the 3rd party product and don't tell us about
them". That's respectable troubleshooting. Saying "don't use any 3rd party
products at all ever" is bizarre, and it sounds like they are using the
problems they have had with coding the transition to dx9 are being used as
an excuse to attack programs that show up inadequacies in their programming.

The fact that eqwindows does a better job of managing multiple instances of
eq than the actual coders inhouse at sony can provide is pretty damning.
