They seem to have a fairly short aggro range. They're down near the flat part of
the land and there's a fair amount of "wall" to run up and along behind them.
But for that section of the trip, I still say the road is a safer bet, even if
you are evil.  No guards out that way, though there is that annoying little
midget who runs around along the last stretch of road before you reach Kith.
He's tried to gank my troll on a number of occasions.
