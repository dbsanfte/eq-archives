    The Spiroc Lord, the mob you appear right beside, death touches. There's
a very nice screen shot of it on The Safehouse, with some poor monk named
Pull. It reads like the Spiroc Lord is skeet shooting - The Spiroc Lord
shouts, "PULL!"

    It's good except it can hit innocents. Example, a guy zoned into Tactics
and went to hop down into the Pit to do XP. As soon as he was over the edge
he saw the raid in progress and thought "Crap, I'm floating down to certain
death." Then he was suddenly ported to an entirely different place and
killed. Whoops.
