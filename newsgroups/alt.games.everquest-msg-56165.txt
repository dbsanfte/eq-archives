True,was long range casting in EK during the event. My RM experience
was zoning in, sitting for a minute near the zone, getting AE'd for
500 and charmed by Reaver. Lucky it broke and he had found somebody
more tastey to eat so I gated out and stayed in EK for the rest of the
event days. So I never knew about that restriction till mentioned now.
Glad I stayed away.
