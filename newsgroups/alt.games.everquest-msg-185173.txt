Richard, if I may ask a Q that has not much to do with this post (sure
havent got any experience in high level guilds OR AA so I can't be helpful
to you), when did you first start cranking out the top level cultural
armour? What smithing skill were you at and how bad was the failure rate?

I have a dark elf chanter twink with 152 smithing, I'm currently collecting
the padding and cash to get him through the fine steel and into the acrylia,
and I'm keen to give myself a numerical goal whereby he can begin making
that uber DE armour for my sk :)

PS I love your posts

Cheers,
James
