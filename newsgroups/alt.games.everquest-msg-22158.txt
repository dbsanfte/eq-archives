Have to agree. I enjoyed not camping for any item in this game; but
now at 51 I find myself sitting in a zone killing over and over and
over for no good reason other then to hope a druid spell drops instead
of the usual chanter, wizard spells I get. 

" Oh look a druid spell!!! Spirit of scale again." :-(

Even lamer is one of the places that the bear pet drops in PoG. Why
not make DE necro spells drop off the ghouls in front of the DE Necro
guild. Oh that's right, that's varant's "lets all interact" which in
the end just turns into "Let's price gouge the druid."

Biz is right though, most druid dropped spells you could do without,
but they would be nice to have.
