EQ does not force you to do any such thing.  I used to have a guildmate that
loved the buying and selling game, I gave him all my business, handing him my
loot to sell on commission, and having him haunt the auction places looking for
certain bits of gear I wanted, also on commission (I'd give him a high amount I
would pay, and we'd split the difference between that and what he paid for it).

Sadly there really aren't all that many people offering this service, but nothing
in EQ stops them from doing it, its just that with the advent of automated Trader
mode, its not nearly as useful as it once was.

Having an NPC to do this job, since so few PC's are interested in doing it, might
be a handy solution... but its not the only way to get the job done.
