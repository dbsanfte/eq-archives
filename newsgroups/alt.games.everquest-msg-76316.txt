My point was if he used one account to start the scam and another to
clean-out any accounts he acquired information for he really lost
nothing from the scam account.  Likely this person only had a few
low level characters on his/her scam starting account and if they
bought the cheapest version of EQ and actually caught anyone with
any decent gear they could transfer it and sell it on Ebay or some
place (maybe to the same poor soul that lost it to begin with).  The
first month comes with the game after all and it is VERY cheap right
now if you look around.  One good item sold could more than make up
for it.

All that said I doubt very much if they caught anyone with any
decent gear.  I certainly hope not.  I would hate to see this scam
pay-off for anyone.
