Sadly, warriors are barely best at absorbing damage, and since at least 
4 of the 6 people in your group will find their output suffers in 
proportion to how good the MA is at Keeping aggro (the healer might do 
better with someone who takes damage better, and of course the MA does 
better the more damage he can take)

If the plan includes slowing the mob, then 5 out of the 6 suffer.. 6 
really, as the warrior fighting an unslowed mob for part of a battle 
wastes whatever advantage in damage absorbtion he may have over a knight 
who faces a mob slowed from the first time it hits him.

So a warrior would have to be LOTS and LOTS better at taking damage to 
be preferable to a knight.  This is the case in a boss mob raid target, 
where by using Defensive discipline a warrior can take a lot bigger 
beating than anyone else... but you can't go using defensive 
continuously while killing a mob every minute.. and even if you could, 
you'd have even worse aggro maintanence problems, so the rest of your 
group would be doing even less.

While I agree that the idea of a tradeoff is a good one, the facts are 
that A) warriors don't currently take damage much better than knights, 
as gear has eroded their HP advantage and B) Aggro means Much more than 
HP in most exp groups.  To keep this difference but still have warriors 
be viable, you need their HP (or mitigation or some combination) to be 
much higher than any other class, and you need the difference in their 
aggro to be much smaller.

SOE seems to be attempting to do both, and at the same time to create a 
new angle; the other problem warriors have is that the two knight 
classes bring more to the table than an ability to get aggro and take a 
beating, while thats all warriors do, really.  Adding in some melee 
class only abilities to affect the combat for your whole group would 
perhaps compensate to some extent for the group having to hold back to 
deal with their poor aggro abilities.

If it works, this looks like a nice three pronged approach to the 
warrior problem.  IF being the main word in that sentence.  Its several 
changes at once, in a game which can find enormous balance changes if 
you fiddle with just a single aspect such as changing the fail rate of 
the Lull line.

Splendid
