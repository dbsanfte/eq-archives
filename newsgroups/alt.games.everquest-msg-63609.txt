I would be willing to bind more often if they removed the cast delay time.
As is if I'm running through a gate (with somewhere to be) and someone needs
a bind, I'd have to sit, change spells, wait a minute for it to be active,
then cast.

Its that extra minute that keeps me from stopping.  Might seem minor, but
its just enough annoyance to keep me from stopping.  Unless I'm in no hurry,
in which case out comes Resolution, Bind, Sheild of Words and I start
buffing newbies =)
