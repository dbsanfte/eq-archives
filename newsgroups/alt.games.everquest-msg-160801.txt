When I looked at a POP box in the store last week,  it seemed to be saying
that the trilogy was included, and I didn't notice anything that said
"requires original version of Everquest".  If I didn't overlook something,
maybe all you'd have to do is buy POP and SOL, which isn't *too* bad.  No
more than $60.
