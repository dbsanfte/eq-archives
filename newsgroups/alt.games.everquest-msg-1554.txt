My Wiz is at 11th level now, and has been using a Great Worn Staff ( ? ) -
2HB, 6 damage.  I partied with a guy who was using a 1HB staff and holding
an item in his other hand that gave him some Mana bonuses.  He suggested
that I start to use 1HB weapons so that I will have the ability to carry an
extra helpful item in the future.

Which choice, in the long run, makes more sense, using a 1HB weapon or a 2HB
weapon?  At higher levels, do the 2HB weapons that I can use cause enough
more damage to offset the ability to hold an extra item in my off hand when
using a 1HB wespon?

I got a cracked staff and started bashing Black Bears to start get my 1HB
started, since it is at zero, but I don't want to wasted a lot of time on
this is the gentleman's advice was incorrect.

Thanks in advance,
-Illuminator
