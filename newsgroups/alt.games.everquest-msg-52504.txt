Probably because he is in the biggest / uberest guild and knows :

a) Every one / guild capable of taking on Vulak
b) Exactly when Vulak has been dropped (every time)
c) Just what dropped
d) Who got it if he is interested

Not to mention the fact that he was probably there either leading the
raid or helping.

Sang *is* Uber.
