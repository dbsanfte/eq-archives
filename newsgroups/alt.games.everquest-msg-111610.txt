I think we may have an exception of sorts to the "you suck" part here.  If,
as Rios seems to imply, he already has a high level mage of his own, but simply
can't muster the raid level forces to get his epic, then he's not really going
to
suck as bad as 99% of the EBayers out there.

I know that if I bought myself a 60 epic cleric there wouldn't be all -that-
much
I'd have to learn, as I'm halfway thru 57 myself... but 9 months away from
epic based on my 65 on the waiting list position.

Interesting thing about his proposal is that he'd be able to transfer the epic
"item" from one server to another, while any other character would
arrive buck naked.  He also has a decent equipment set to transfer, just
by stripping his current mage.  Of course he won't have the same drop
spells, perhaps, and will lose his no-drop equipment... but the Mage
Epic is a helluva thing all on its own.
