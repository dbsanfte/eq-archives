hi eq recently started freezing up for a second or 2 it seems to be
quite random any ideas? thx.     also when i log in i have to press
the numlock key to be able to move and i set off on auto run and to
stop i have to press numlock again as the cursor keys will not turn
off auto run...just a minor point but a bit annoying ..... thx again
