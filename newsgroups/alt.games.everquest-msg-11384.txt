The Ghoulbane can only be used by a Paladin. The shin lord
uses the Ghoulbane. Only a paladin can Lay on hands. The shin
lord lays on hands.

Riddle me what...? ;)

But actually, Riddle *me* this...

The shin lord is a rare spawn. He has placeholders. To make him spawn
you must kill his placeholders. if you do , he will aggro you as your
faction is shot.

If the quest does start with him, how do our paladins actually get
to meet the little flappyfeets? And if they're willing to massacre
the placeholders with a SK friend, for example, then surely they're
willing to do the same to the Lord himself?
