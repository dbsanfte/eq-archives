Only the higher level ones.  It's been a while but either 44 or 49 is
the first Necro pet to lifetap.

I doubt this is true.  I've seen 10,000 points of damage done on a
rooted target trying to get root to break with no luck and conversely
have also seen three or four roots in a row get broken by my weedy 75
point bow proc.

Interestingly the bow proc is a low level Wizard DD, perhaps there's a
hidden field that Lucy won't parse that changes things like root
breaks, resists etc by spell based on class.  I do know that the
Crucible firmly believes that Sha's Revenge sticks more readily than
Turgurs...
