I never had a lot of confidence in the M16, however as a radio operator and
forward observer I liked that it was light and really easy to carry.  When I
was in ANGLICO we considered rifles to be useless, given that if we had ever
been in a situation that we had to use personal weapons we would have been
royally fucked anyway.  My weapon of choice was the 155mm howitzer, operated by
someone else.
