Heh. I know; I feel the same way. For the record, I've been happily
married for 10 years, have a beautiful, well adjusted 6 yr. old
daughter, and my social life and mental health are just peachy, thanks.
Ditto for my husband. We have both played EQ for a couple of years now.
We are employed, pay our bills on time, drink rarely (which I happen to
think is a *good* thing), don't have any chemical dependencies... Well,
okay, I do kind of have a thing for artichoke cheese dip and yes, I eat
it while I play EQ. OMG! Maybe I should sue Sony for my artichoke bill!
It's all their fault! If I didn't play EQ, I wouldn't feel compelled to
make and eat the dip! At $3.29 a can for artichoke hearts and $9.00 a
pound for the cheese, I think I've been missing an opportunity here.
