The last time I had problems like that, I -think- what fixed it was 
installing the VIA 4-in-1 driver thingys that I'd forgotten to install.  
It might also have been cleaning all the dust out of the computer though.  
But I'm pretty sure the 4-in-1 thingy is what actually fixed it.  So if 
your motherboard has a VIA chipset, you might try that.  Or if there's 
other mysterious drivers for your chipset, etc.
