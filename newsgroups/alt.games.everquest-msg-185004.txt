Thanks for the info.  As a casual EQ player, I don't really know about 
what spells cost what components.  As a matter of fact, until I tried 
playing a few other classes, I didn't know about components needed for 
spells.  At that time, the only spell I had that needed a component 
didn't use it up and I didn't realize other spells lose the component at 
first.  What a difference a year makes.
Your list is going in my 'important EQ information' file, I know i'll 
need it eventually.
