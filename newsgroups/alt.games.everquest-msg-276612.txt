They advertised it a lot on the National Geographic Channel and/or Discovery
and/or the History Channel.  (I've got all those and/or's in there because
those three form a set that I check on when channel surfing, and I don't
really keep track of what show goes with which channel, so I'm not sure
which one(s) I was seeing all the Dragon ads on).
