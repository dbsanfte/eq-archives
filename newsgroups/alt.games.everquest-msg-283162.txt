And if what you said was true, please provide this link to the message 
stating this from Sony.  Even if it was true, which it isn't.  What 
about all the people who didn't continue because they couldn't afford 
the higher rate?  Or the MANY people who had to change credit card 
numbers.  This is nothing but BS from Sony.  They seem to have this 
crazy idea that there are no other mmog's on the market.

If sony can afford $199 for 2 years, then they shouldn't be making such 
a mess out of offering the $99/yr deal.

There is a big duscussion about this on the  soe official forums. It
is going to be fixed and those who had to pay to 149 dollar ate to
continue play over last weekend will get reimbursed. The 99 dollar
rate is correct, officially.
