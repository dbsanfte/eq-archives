You need a fletching skill of 235 to have the combine be trivial to you.
To get your skill up to that level, you will need thousands of plat. You
are *much* better off, financially speaking, just doing the quest over and
over again until you succeed.

For myself, the kiola nuts and the microservers were annoying enough that
I waited until I had enough for 10 tries at once before I tried any of the
combines. Otherwise travel time (even with PoP) will eat you alive for the
quest.

Still, I eventually succeeded on try #35 with a skill of 103. I spent about
two weeks of camping those really annoying clockworks and went from level
12 to level 15 doing it. In addition, I got myself a Bootstrutter Pack
from the gnomes as well.
