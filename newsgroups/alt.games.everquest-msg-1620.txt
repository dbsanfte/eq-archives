Heh, Bizz you go ahead and get them outclassed lvl 6s killed as you see
fit.  Just don't kite over the top of my group outside Karnors if I'm 
playing my enchanter or my cleric.  Well if you really want go ahead,
just don't be too surprised at losing your target if it agros on my
group.  Stop by and cast sow if you want, but don't bother with my
chars, just hit the puller, we ain't running no where.

As you may have guessed by now, I was adressing the topic of dr00ds, not
the quality of life in Oasis.  That is one of the zones I avoid at all
costs other than to pass through, with SK ranking right up there as
well.
