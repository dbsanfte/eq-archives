Actually, it doesn't stop them from popping up.  Rather, it closes any
unexpected IE window as soon as it notices it, unless there are no
other IE windows up.  This usually happens before the window is drawn
on the screen, so you don't see it.  However, sometimes you will
briefly see the window flash up.
