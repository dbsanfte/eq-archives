Hey Ho all :)

With regards UK players, I'd like to ask what isp they can recommend
for playing EQ with a 56k connection.

Im with Nutshell but their service has a few problems at the moment
and I haven't been able to connect properly for nearly a week now. In
case this situation persists, I'll start looking at other isps as a
backup. 

I'd be grateful if other UK players could give me any recommendations
for a suitable alternative isp for EQ.

:)
