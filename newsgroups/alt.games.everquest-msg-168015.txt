The directions on the invite point you to the secret forums of the beta 
testers. This is the best place to get information on the game. There's 
also an instruction sheet of the rudiments that comes with the beta disk.

The hardest part is convincing your network card to speak to your 
network and get it set up that way. Once you do that, the game itself is 
pretty easy.

There's not a lot of actual role-playing going on in this game- it's 
rough to do without keyboards. I do recommend splurging on a keyboard.

Levels 1 through 5 aquaint you with all the game basics. It's very 
straightforward, I thought.
