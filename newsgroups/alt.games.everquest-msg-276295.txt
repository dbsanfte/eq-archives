Well, I'm of the opinion that it is. Even though I play computer games
to relax and as a diversion, I still need there to be some point to
what I'm doing - some carrot to keep me interested. If it becomes too
close to instant gratification, it becomes far less interesting, and
I'll go find something else to do.

For the record, I think that is actually the majority. Seriously, what
other motivation is there beyond being able to socialize with friends?
If it's just the socialization aspect, why pay $14.95 or more per month
for that when you can get it from any number of IRC or other chat
rooms?

I'm trying to remain open minded here, and do realize that others get
other things out of the game, but we are still talking primarily about
a *gaming* community here.

The scale is obviously different, but the point is valid. Any
achievement is lessened when it is purchased rather than "achieved".

Are you a father? If you are, then you shouldn't even need to ask that
question. In case you're not, let me clue you in. When it's given to
you by a loved one, the tecnical validity of the claim matters not. All
that is important is that the giver feels that way. If you buy it
yourself, then yeah, it's pretty lame and amounts pretty much to what
the previous poster was criticizing - false achievement.
