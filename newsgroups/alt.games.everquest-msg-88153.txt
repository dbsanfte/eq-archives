Oh sure, everything was fine until they 'fixed' things (and nothing
mentioned about spell effects!).

64MB Geforce2 GTS

Only way I can describe this is the bright and colorful spell effects you'd
see when casting (not talking about the animations and particle count) now
look like you're looking at them through a welding mask.

I noticed in Dawnshroud they've done some absolutely dumbass thing where the
sky fucking turns dark and light and dark and light depending on your
position next to um, trees and rocks.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to
simulate shading from foilage but it FUCKING sucks and it was beautiful
before.  I'll bet dollars to donuts it has to do with this goddamned Umbra
technology.

Net effect of this neato light bullshit they can't seem to get right after
how many months and patches now is some watered down - welding mask covered
looking spell effects.

Nice VI.  putzs

Oh, and the video lag is back.  Awful framerate performance while you're at
it.

Nvidia 23.12 btw.
PS - I won't downgrade video drivers to make the game work - that's their
job so I don't want to hear this bullshit that you need a lesser version of
this or that.  Fuck that - make the shit work.

So basically, yesterdays patch earns the coveted 2 middle fingers of
disapproval for VI and their programming staff of rabies laden, shit eating,
monkies.
