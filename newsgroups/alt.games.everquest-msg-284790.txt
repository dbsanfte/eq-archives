I'm not familiar with that particular laptop, graphics card, etc.
However, I do have a Netgear wireless router, and I've had problems
using it for EQ.  I find if I'm connected via the wireless, I lose
my EQ connection quite often, within minutes.  But if I take an
ethernet cable and connect the laptop directly to my DSL router
(which is also where the Netgear box is plugged in), I have no
problems.

Even my wife's PC, which is cabled in via one of the physical ports
provided on the wireless box, has much more frequent linkdeaths.

On the other hand, I don't suffer the sort of lag you described, so
I'm guessing that part of your problem has more to do with the
graphics card etc., as someone has already responded elsewhere in
this thread.
