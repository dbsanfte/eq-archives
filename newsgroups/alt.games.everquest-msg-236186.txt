I was online when this first happened.  It happened shortly after the 
stress test for the new hard drive storage system they were testing.  My 
guess is their attempt at improving the 'save character with every 
transaction' really screwed up the database.

At the time this happened my system crashed when I attempted to zone. 
After that I never got back in game so I have no idea whether my avatars 
still existed or not.
