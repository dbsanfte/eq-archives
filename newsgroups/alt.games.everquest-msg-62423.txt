lots of good advice in this thread. weigh it all before you make a decision.

CL in RAM isn't important unless you're planning on overclocking. CL2 is for
overclockers, CL3 is for everybody else. don't worry about the CL rating.
pay a few more dollars for RAM you can be sure of. buying from crucial is a
no-lose situation.

your vid cards are definitely not up to snuf. if you've never seen better
then it's not hard to put up with low resolutions and low frame rates. but
if your computer ever lags when a big spell is cast or lots of people are in
view, then imagine what luclin is going to do to your computer. it will be
like that most of the time. LAAAAGGGGGGGG!!!

as someone else said, i think IBM has you over a barrell. so...

i'm going to go out on a limb here and tell you to take the plunge: gut your
system!

a motherboard with an nForce chipset is a definite option as it has a built
in GeForce2MX video card. it takes DDR memory and you can throw a duron
(cheap) cpu in it. you should be able to spend a bit less than your 400
bucks to IBM (even paying someone else to put it together for you) and you
will have essentially a new computer. buy the stuff yourself and bring all
the parts to a local computer store (get some referrals to find a reliable
one) and ask them to do the work. maybe call around and get a feel for who
can do it the best for the least money. or find a computer savvy friend that
wouldn't mind a couple dinners paid for to do this for you :).

your wife's computer seems a fairly good unit. you can upgrade the RAM
cheaply. you should be able to upgrade her video card since gateway's have
AGP slots most of the time. I'd even look at a CPU upgrade for her system.
luclin is going to be one hell of a trailer and the closer you can get to a
MACK truck to be able to pull it the better off your gaming experience will
be.

Wife's system upgrade:
RAM = 60 bucks
GeForce2 MX400 = 60 bucks
OR
GeForce2 GTS = 75 bucks
OR
GeForce3 Ti200 = 175 bucks
CPU upgrade ~ 75 to 100 bucks

Your system upgrade option 1:
nForce motherboard with onboard GF2MX video = 180 bucks
Duron CPU = 50 bucks
512 MB DDR RAM = 100 bucks
labor to put it together for you = 20 to 100 bucks
you may need a case (~50 bucks) to get this one working since even the IBM
case is bound to be proprietary.

Your system upgrade option 2:
barebones from mwave = 375 bucks
includes : DFI mobo, 1.0GHz athlon, 512 MB DDR RAM, good enough case
GeForce2 MX400 = 60 bucks

you can search around for other bare bones deals that might be cheaper. any
motherboards built on the KT133a chipset are worth looking at also. they
take regular SDRAM (same as your wife's machine). i overestimated on most of
these, or chose an item that has lower level options. if you're looking at
spending 400 bucks on that IBM machine don't do it. gut it and get something
worth having and that you can upgrade in the future. the nForce motherboards
have integrated GF2MX video on them, but they have an AGP slot that you can
put anything you want in it later. the KT266a motherboards (the DFI in that
mwave barebones is one) are currently the performance kings, and the Athlons
are beating the P4's in most benchmarks (plus they're tons cheaper). the
Duron CPUs will work in any Athlon motherboard and are the equivalent of the
Celeron to the P3 or P4. you can't beat a 950 MHz duron for 50 bucks. go
down to 30 bucks you're still getting a 700 MHz one. check on pricewatch for
duron/mobo combos for around 120 bucks. another 50 bucks in RAM and a video
card (and possibly a case) you've got your new EQ box. 300 bucks average
easy.

so cozy up to the closest computer guru you know and get yourself a nice EQ
box. but be careful, once your wife sees what you're playing on she's going
to want a major upgrade to :).

alright, time to do some work today.
