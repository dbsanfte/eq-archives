One technique I just started using is to go back thru your log file
(assuming you have logging turned on) and just clip out the
conversations that you've had with NPCs and glue them into a doc,
along with perhaps a few notes about where you were at the time.  It's
a bit of a pain but it's easier than trying to scroll back and write
everything down.  And seems like more fun than just going to spoiler
sites, at least for the simpler quests.
