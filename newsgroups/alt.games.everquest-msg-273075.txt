"typically"?  Go read the boards, that statement only applies to a half
dozen (out of 80+) servers that became drastically overpopulated.  Most
people playing the game have never seen a queue.  Ironically, it's the
people that most wanted to race their way up to the highest level (and
the sheep that followed them) that ended up suffering the queues.  I must
admit I derive an evil pleasure from that bit of karmic irony.  =)
