I have found something fun to do with OE.  Just create some message rules
that will highlight certain posters:

Go to "tools"
click message rules
click news
make sure you are in the news tab
click new

Now, the fun part.
Check the box that says "where the from line contains people"
Check the box that says "highlight it with color"
add news1reporter@yahoo.com to the people and have it highlight with red.
name the rule "trolling fuckwit".  You can add multiple email addresses to
the rules, so feel free to add any other trolls.

Repeat the above steps on a new rule, this time add bizbee's email address
and have it highlight with bright green.  Name this rule "blowhard".  Of
course you could just add him to the trolling fuckwit group, but why pass up
the opportunity to have a different color than red.  Plus, he can be counted
on to generate lots of nasty green replies.

Repeat the first steps for other posters that post a lot and often.  Dark
Tyger comes to mind here.  Highlight his with a nice bright color (fuchsia
perhaps) and name his rule "village idiot" or "dumbass". Either are
appropriate and he can be counted on to add his spin to most threads in
here.

Keep adding rules. Have fun with it.  There are many contributors to the
group, many offer useful insight but the majority of the real heavy-hitters
have long since ceased to contribute anything of use, so why not add them as
decoration?

Now, the next time you see the group with lots of responses it should look
like a Christmas tree!

Enjoy.
