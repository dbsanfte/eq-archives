It is a rite of passage. This isn't a numbers game. I did staff of the
Wheel cause Wizards should do that quest, lots of better weapons than
the Burning Rapier, The necro skullcap in Cabilis is way porrer than
the 10pp head Item I can get in the Bazaar.

When I played a lot of pencil and paper RPG, I had a game where I used
a system that nobody knew in my group, I wrote out that they were
masters at some skills, good at others and "knew something about"
others. I game them stuff and described it like you would see it, not
by saying that gives you a +3 STR.

I think I am going to get hostile to this kinda MONTY HAUL attitude.
