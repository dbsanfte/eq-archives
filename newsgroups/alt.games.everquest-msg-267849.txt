This is where you're going wrong - tempers, washes, oils, etc, should
all be made by you - when you make them yourself, each batch is a
batch of 3 - compared to 24  or 48c you're paying for a single one.

I'm a level 13 Artisan, and will make 14 in my next session, ann I
currently have 90s, as I only buy fuels.  If I'm making stuff for the
sake of levelling, and run out of, say, lead for temper, then I stop
crafting think that require it.  I don't buy it, ever.

And when you're making this with iron, turqouise, etc, you shouldn't
be bothering with tin, lead, etc, unless you really have to - they're
too low to give decent xp.

Think of it like combat - don't bother fighting cons that are blue to
you - go look for whites and yellows.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
