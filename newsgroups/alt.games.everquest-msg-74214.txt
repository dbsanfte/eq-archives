This is a known bug happening with certain graphics cards. Gamma doesn't
work with my ATI card. Now whether Verrant is doing anything about it --
that's a different story!

With sky turned off due to ANOTHER bug, and the sound being crappy, this
makes for challenging and annoying gameplay.

It's been over a month now with this bug, and about 10% of the people I talk
to in zones have it. The last fix I saw was something about fixing sleeves
on some character! HELLO???? ANYBODY WORKING THERE VERRANT???
