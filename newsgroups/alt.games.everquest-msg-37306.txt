Let me ask you a very simple question.  Why do you care what the rule
is?  It seems to me the only answer which makes any sense is, "So I
can farm stuff."  It's not as though you can't *go* to the zone.  It's
not as though you can't *kill* green stuff to your heart's content.
It's not as though you can't get money and other loot from the mobs.
What is the *one thing* that's affected?  Your ability to get pH47
1337 from a mob that probably couldn't hit you once in 30 tries.
Let's at least have the honesty to call a spade a spade.

Yep.

Precisely.

> What is the difference?

The difference is that the low or mid level gets experience.  The
difference is that for the low or mid level, a major investment of
time and resources is required before he can even dream about getting
an item which is to him marvelous, and to you, an extra 1k in the bank
account.  Contrary to what you may have heard, it isn't meant to be a
game about getting uber gear.  It's meant to be a game about brave
battles, barely won.

I think some of you need to step back a bit.  Do you honestly think
that when VI goes to all the trouble of adding a new (or revamping an
old) dungeon, they say to themselves, "Well, no one will come here,
but we've made the farmers happy."

They want people to come to the dungeons.  I do too.  My most
memorable times in EQ have been in dungeons and not in the endless
grinding outdoor xp camps.
