Unfortunately, I seem to have picked a place too close to nasty spawns (such
as Xytl and Gix) that kill me without compunction to have no trouble
soloing. It certainly wasn't because I didn't know how -- I soloed gorge
hounds in the Karanas (while keeping an eagle eye out for the eyes) with no
trouble. I have, since then, gone back to the method I used then, and I have
not died at all since doing so, plus my experience has been much better.
(and I am still in WCommons)

For the most part, when I wrote the original post, I was venting. I actually
did know (somewhere in the back of my brain) what needed to be done, and
have, since then, changed/adjusted my tactics. I just hated the fact that I
couldn't be Superman (er, woman), killing them all with a single
stroke/spell, etc... Thank you for the post, however.
