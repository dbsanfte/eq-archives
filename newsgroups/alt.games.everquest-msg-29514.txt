NO, there isn't.  Chess is a game that can be reduced to logic paths. 
GO, on the other hand, supposedly can't be beaten by a program.  Chess
is a game of statistics and memory.  The only time "strategy" or
"Creativity" come into play is when you are looking into your opponents
eyes and finesse him/her by playing a chess metagame.
