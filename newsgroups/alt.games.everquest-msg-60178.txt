OpenGL is not the same thing as Glide.  EQ has never used OpenGL.  EQ was
developed in an era when 3DFX was still the leader in 3D acceleration, and
generic 3D API's hadn't stabalized to the point they have now, so Glide was
a fairly common option at the time.

Not so anymore, for fairly obvious reasons :)
