Now do the maths.....

Let's assume a mob gives 1000xp (nice and simple to work out) and your
group kills it. This is the xp distribution:-

>  a.. 2 person group - 2% total bonus.

1000 + 2% (20) = 1020, divide by 2 = 510 each person.

>  b.. 3 person group - 6% total bonus.

1000 + 6% (60) = 1060, divide by 3 = 354 each person.

>  c.. 4 person group - 10% total bonus.

1000 + 10% (100) = 1100, divide by 4 = 275 each person.

>  d.. 5 person group - 14% total bonus.

1000 + 14% (140) = 1140, divide by 5 = 228 each person.

>  e.. 6 person group - 20% total bonus.

1000 + 20% (200) = 1200, divide by 6 = 200 each person.

A couple of times, I've ended up leaving my group (of 5 people)
because some bright spark *insisted* we recruit a 6th person because
we'd get more xp.... despite the fact our camp was already
ridiculously easy with the team we already had (this was in the Sarnak
tower in Overthere).

You get less xp per kill when you are grouped, than if you solo... but
in general, the fewer you are, the more downtime you suffer, so it all
evens out. Also, in general, it is safer to be in a group and you have
a wider range of mobs to fight.
