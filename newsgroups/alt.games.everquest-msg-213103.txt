Poor Iksar.  They get hatched in communal clutches and never know their 
mothers or fathers.  I guess that's why Koscha never learned the 
valuable lesson every parent has told their child -- "Don't talk to 
strangers!"

Now, being Iksar, one of the most hated races in all of Norrath, Koscha 
is a careful sort.  She eyeballs people from afar and sees whether or 
not they are indifferent to her, amiable, merely dubious or 
apprehensive, or the oh-so-dangerous "scowls, ready to attack."  And if 
they're indifferent to her or better, more often than not she trots up 
and says "Hail" -- "Hail" being like "Hi" or "Hey" or "Yo, dude, 'sup?" 
in Norrath and Luclin and like places.

So, naturally, while jogging through the Desert of Ro (which used to be 
a lovely elven forest before the god of fire burned it all up or 
something), when she sees this Erudite with a skeleton pet standing 
around, she checked him out from afar.  He was quite indifferent to her, 
so up she wandered and hailed him.

Apparantly, he didn't want to be hailed.

Next thing Koscha knows, she's running full-tilt back across the desert, 
in the grip of a horrible, magic TERROR with the necromancer and his pet 
hot on her heels.  As soon as she gets control of herself, she hits the 
sand and plays dead.  It's a thing monks, even scaley reptillian monks, 
can do.  Koscha's not perfect at it; sometimes she just falls down.  But 
this worked.

Then she waited for the bad Erudite to wander off, the way the orcs and 
undead and other monsters tended to do.

And she waited.

And she waited some more.

And it got very uncomfortable lying there with her head buried in the 
sand and pretending to be dead.

But he wouldn't go away.

Oh, dear.

"Maybe," Koscha thought (not that it was easy thinking with her head 
buried in the hot hot sand), "he's forgotten that he wants to kill me."

So she popped back to her feet.

The Erudite started casting a spell.

Uh-oh.

Immediately, Koscha tried playing dead again, but it didn't work this 
time, so up on her feet she sprang and swiftly she took off toward the 
greenery to the south... again, with Erudite and pet charging after her 
with spells and staff.  Once more, twice, three times she hit the dirt 
and failed to feign, but finally, with a good-sized dune between her and 
them and the greenery right in sight, she summoned up all her acting 
skills (gimme an Oscar!) and collapsed, as dead-looking as dead could be.

And she waited some more; the Erudite was out of sight.  Was he out of 
angry-range?

Cautiously, she got to her feet again, tense and twitching.

Nothing happened.

Sighing with relief, Koscha jogged double-time into Innothule Swamp, 
touched the portal book with some relief, and collapsed into her bed in 
New Tanaan, in the Plane of Knowledge, lesson learned.

Do not hail strange Erudites in the desert.

P.S. Many thanks to Teapray, who seemed quite ready to rush to the aid 
of this foolish little Iksar; the sentiment was very much appreciated. :)
