    What you really need to balance is the downtime mitigation of a given
gear set with the DPS possible with a given gear set. Beyond that, it
shouldn't be too hard to balance - forbidding gear swapping while on a hate
list, and having long-term abilities drop if forbidden gear sets are used
(put on a plate BP, your pet poofs) would stamp out most of the possible
problems.

    They don't have all skills at the same time. Depending on how they've
geared themselves, they have a subset of the abilities as an option at any
given time.

    Nope, that leads to "effective classes" as people pick templates and get
locked into them. At no point should someone get locked into being
anything - it defeats the whole purpose.

    That's effectively what I envision. The best sword has -25 to casting
level, or a truly exceptional plate BP might have Allowed: Fire nukes.

    ...disallow swapping when on a hate list (you can't change pants when
something is trying to kill you!), and have certain long-term effects (like
pets) poof if a gear item which wouldn't allow the character to generate
that effect is swapped in. That should stop the abusive aspects by and
large, assuming you've balanced your downtime reducing effects with your DPS
effects. If you're really worried, make downtime reducing effects only be
usable in combat as well - can't heal unless you're in a fight, so no
fighting then swapping for the heal. I don't mind people swapping roles
outside of combat, though. In fact, I'd consider it a plus - makes it a lot
easier to form groups if anyone can be the healer that day.
