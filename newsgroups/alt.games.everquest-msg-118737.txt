Your fatal mistake: loc 0 0 is not in the exact center of the zone. Also, it
seems like a lot of work for the server to be doing everytime the client
needs to know something about direction or location. Now, instead of just
reporting a value, I'm making a computation and reporting the new value.  t
would just be easier to fix the zone most likely. Not that I've ever noticed
this problem before, so it's not that big of a deal; it doesn't make the
trip last any longer or shorter.
