My point is, I can with a high enough certainty that planning for it to be
otherwise is needless.  I know that on one pull out of a thousand I'll go
LD, but I don't ask someone else to pull because of that.  In fact, that's
not even a very good analogy.  Nothing to be done about going LD, whereas on
those few and far between pulls where something truly unexpected occurs,
well, there's a reason a character named "Faned" is pulling.  :)

Hardly, if you know the rules the pathing engine plays by and the way
pathing points *have* to be laid out, you will not often be surprised by
pathing.  Frustrated occasionally, but seldom surprised.
