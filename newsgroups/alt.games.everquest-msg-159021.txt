Glad you're having fun.  One thing I forgot to mention is that on
Tunare server there is a 50% reduction in all xp awards in JP, so
all you Tunareans can just move along, nothing to see here.  :-p

A quest to change religions would be interesting, but only if it made
you permanently KOS to all NPC followers of your original diety, and
of course it ought to be very difficult (not another mindless timesink,
difficult!), perhaps involving an xp loss equal to half-a-dozen post-50
levels or so.
