I think the article was trying to say if i dont spend some of my trains 
i can use them towards aa later on. 
but i guess your saying this isnt the case at all
Im not sure what to spend my trains on lately too
Ive been piling them into research to save the hassle involved in 
practising research(gathering all the components etc) but am not sure if 
theres something better to spend them on
at lvl 32 i only have 28 lvls till 60 so thats 28 * 5 = 140
I didnt really want to spent all that on spell research but it seems i 
would need to if i am going to ever max it
Im max on all my main things like meditate, evocation etc etc as i make 
a point of maxing them out all the time which is easy for them
