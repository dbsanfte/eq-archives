Yeah, I was going to say something about that too, but figured he really did
mean hitting with the weapon.  Actually, bash has nothing to do with race,
that is done with a shield, slam is the racial ability, if we are going to
pick nits here (of course, I could be wrong about that too, but I'm pretty
sure slam is what my shaman has, and bash is what my melee types have).  So,
assuming a magic shield, he could bash a wisp just fine, even if he was
wielding an FS weapon which would not hit the wisp.  As far as slam, I don't
recall if there are restrictions on when that can and cannot hit mobs that
can only be hit with magic weapons.
