This fits in with what I've observed:

On a K6-2 500M with 512MB zoning takes several minutes.
On an Athlon 1.4G with 512MB the same zone took 14 seconds.

That says to me that something very processor intensive is going on.

Or as Luclin installs new textures, why weren't zones in the new
format included too?
