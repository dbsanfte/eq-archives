    Good for building aggro, good for getting you to last six seconds. Flops
if you get summoned during the insertion period (stupid that you end up in
the middle of the mob), has a four second gap between you going in and you
getting CH. This is for unplanned transitions - sounds fine to me for a
planned switch.

    Yes, you do. We'll typically do 4-5 second intervals on certain VT
bosses when tank is defensive, and 3-4 seconds when not. We don't use /pause
in our CH hotkeys, though, because we're not a bunch of bot clerics being
programmed to do the same thing all fight long. We have a total of 24
guilded level 60 clerics, might as well make them work, no? ;-)

    Aye, I think Furor sets that tone. It's good for finding out new VT
drops, though, as they drop. Bard drums with 3x modifier, cleric arms with a
35 point MoR effect - drool!
