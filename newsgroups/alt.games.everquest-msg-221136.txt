They spawn where the golem dies, I am absolutely certain of this, unless 
of course SoE changed it in the last 6 months or so.

There are three Golems in Fear, only two of them will cause a broodling 
to spawn upon dying.  One of the three is easier than the others, as he 
does not Death Touch.  He does AoE a cold spell, but, it's not too bad.  
The other two golems both Death Touch.  This means the person who gets 
aggro first will die.  After that, every 45? seconds, the person who is 
highest on the hate list will die as well.  There is no way to avoid the 
Death Touch, it will kill.  The good news is that for the broodlings, you 
only need to go after one of the Death Touching golems.  On the other 
hand, other people also need drops off the golems, SKs and Warriors I 
know for sure, so, it's a good idea to kill all three while you are 
there.

Come with lots of DPS, designate a sacrificial puller to grab the golem, 
that puller will die, then try to kill the golem before his Death Touch 
refreshes.  On your first attempts, you probably won't succeed in this, 
so be sure you have several tanks lined up to MA them.

You have stated nothing about the level of players in your guild, or the 
number of people that will be there, so it's hard to be very specific.
