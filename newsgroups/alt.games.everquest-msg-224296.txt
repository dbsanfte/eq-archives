Make sure auto attack is off when you Feign.
This is a must. Set up a hotkey if you want it fast.

If you get the message: So-and-so has fallen to the ground.
Then that is the fail message. If you get no message at all then
the FD was a success.

Caster mobs will break feign if they are casting when you FD
because they will continue to cast and when the spell lands it
WILL break Feign 100% of the time. The game now gives a message
now when this happens.

Some times on a successful Feign the mobs will swing at you a few more
times. This is due to typical lag. This will not break Feign however.

Remember if you get no message then it was a success.
