I can decode d00d sp34k, but avoid it and generally avoid those who use it.

Basically, somebody who wants to save a couple of seconds of their time
at the expense of an extra half second of everybody else's time is not
somebody I want to waste time on.

I don't complain about it either. I just ignore those who use it.

In a group, there are occasions when the ability to type quickly is at
a premium, so it's fair enough to abbreviate; there *are* times when half
a second of somebody else's time is worth a second of everybody else's.
Deliberate obfuscation, which is half of d00d sp34k, is another matter.

It's similar in a lot of ways to a lot of the standard "rules" for conduct
on Usenet - in a one-to-many communication, the one must consider the
multiplying effect in use of time. It's one reason why spamming is so
heinous, because spammers take that relationship and abuse it enormously.

Perhaps you think this places my head firmly between my buttocks. Rest
assured that gratuitous d00d sp34k definitely inclines me to the same
judgement of those who use it. :-)
