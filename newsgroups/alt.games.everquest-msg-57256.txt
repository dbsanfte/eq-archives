Well, you can get a better robe with some stats (FBR or Oracle come to
mind.) Possibly a staff with stats also. (Staff of Writhing is pretty
cheap these days as I recall. Not too shabby for the first twnenty
levels or so.) You could also contact your local PC jeweler and see what
they would charge you for some low end mana/HP jewelery. The gold stuff
doens't cost too much and would increase your mana pool. Remember...
particularly at the low levels, mana=life.  But mostly, as the others
mentioned, buy up all your first few levels of spells. Not having to
scrimp and save every copper to try to get the full list of spells is
probably the biggest boost a young caster can have.
