I find that other than on raids, people only need to know if something is 
not going as expected.  If I get resists slowing, then the healer, and 
possibly others in the group need to know, so I let them know.  If I am 
not getting resisted, then they assume that I am slowing, and that 
everything is going as expected.  I really don't need to know when the 
cleric casts a CHeal, I assume he is doing his job, if I see the tank 
getting precariously low on HP, I toss a heal on him, worst case, I've 
wasted a small amount of mana.  I always assume that the rest of the 
group is doing their job, which in general they are.
