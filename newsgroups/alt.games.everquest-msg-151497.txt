> forth of July, Gnome style.

Or better still:  "Gnome, Fourth of July Style" .... the recipe.

Ingredients: 1 Live Gnome, 6 Blackburrow Stouts, 5 cups of Gunpowder, 2 cups
of Iron Filings, 1 three inch Wick, Large Cork (drilled) and a 2H pencil.

Utensils: Toilet Plunger, Kitchen Twine, Large Bucket.

Directions.

1. Marinade Gnome in large bucket filled with 5 Blackburrow Stout till
easily pliable. Note: when Gnome offers his sister for the sixth Blackburrow
Stout he is pliable enough.

2. Remove Gnome from bucket, drain and invert.

3. Using the toilet plunger pack gnome with Gunpowder and iron filings in a
gateaux layering manner. Ie, one cup of gunpowder, one of iron filings,
another gunpowder, iron filings followed by the last 3 cups of gunpowder.
Pack firmly for maximum effect. When gnome gets silly grin on it's face
consider the packing to be complete.

4. Cap Gnomes bunghole with drilled cork, insert wick into the drilled cork
and ram the 2H pencil halfway up bungholr alongside cork, with the sharp end
exposed. Note: do not insert pencils pointy end in Gnome as internal leakage
can dampen the powder.

5. Bind Gnome tightly every half inch from head to toe with kitchen twine:
in other words about 5 bindings max...

6. Hang Gnome out overnight to sober up and next morning you have your
Fourth of July Style Gnome: enjoy!


Safety Notices.
-Never set your Fourth of July Style Gnome indoors, it does tend to stink a
bit let alone leave powder burns on the ceiling.
-Never point your Fourth of July Style Gnome at a person, even jokingly.
Gnomes are butt ugly, foul mouthed, impolite and hence are likley to offend
pre-ignition.
-Never set of Fourth of July Style Gnome with washing on the line or in high
fire danger conditions. Burning gnome gibbs have been known to cause
secondary fires if due caution is not used.
-This project is not recommended for children under the age of 6 as Gnomes
have been known to enjoy such an experience. Sick bastids.
