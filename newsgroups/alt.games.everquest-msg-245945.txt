I hear your frustration but I think this is a terrible idea.

1) If I've previously grouped with some total asshat 
[incompetent/mouthy/jerk or a combination of those] and vow never again 
to play with him I don't want uncle-Sony to dump me in groups with him. 
I'm an adult I can choose not to play with people I don't care for. So 
if I got jammed in a group with him... I'd immediately disband and ooc 
lfg...

2) Meanwhile the picky-for-a-class whiners will just turn LFG off and 
stand around ooc/shouting 65th XXX LF-for-the-perfect-G... and also 
avoid the system altogether.
