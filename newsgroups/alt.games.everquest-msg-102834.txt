It can be.  Since you have limited experience (and there's nothing
wrong with that), I suggest you talk to a doctor or psychiatrist that
treats alcoholism to find out the real story.  Or go to a few AA
meetings and listen to the stories people tell.

And, since this is not an alcohol recovery newsgroup, I'll stop
talking about it now.
