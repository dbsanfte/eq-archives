I'm almost positive swimming skill has a bearing on the amount of time
you can hold your breath, but then again, maybe stamina does too. Being
a Karana Worshipper with lots of cultural vale leather and a Robe of
living fungus, my Stamina is giving my wisdom a run for its money.

Anyway, I just realized today how very useful having a high swimming
skill is... I was at the Erudin Library, when I heard the shout that the
boat was leaving the docks. I hauled ass back to the docks, jumped in
the water, swam out, caught up with the boat, overtook it, and used the
"matter scoop" method to get in. It saved me the run from NK to
Queynos... :)
