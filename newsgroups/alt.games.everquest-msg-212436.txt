First get everyone to 65 before attempting anything.  Level is too
critical in this game.

PoN/PoD trash mobs?  They hit for at most about 350ish.  ToVN dragons
will hit harder.  Vyemm hits for 1150 per pop.  Aaryonarr hits for 900
per.  But it's usually not their melee that will screw you over, it's
the AE.

With just four groups, you're going to need more levels and probably a
significant amount of AA skills especially it sounds like you won't
have much in the way of equipment (unless you get a bunch of Ornate
stuff and PoP weapons).  Your DPS will just not be high enough to get
past Aary without more level, PoP calibre weapons and AA skills up the
wazoo.

>Are they slowable? 

Some are, some aren't.

>Are they snare-able? 

Why?  You planning on kiting a dragon in ToVN?

Uhhh, not a snowball's chance in hell?
Because a mid 50's warrior would basically need elemental level armor
to stand a chance and to get elemental armor, you'll have to kill mobs
significantly tougher than ToVN dragons (read:  mobs that make Vyemm
look a like a freaking orc pawn--you know, 3500hps per hit mobs).

>Has anyone ever tanked them with a
>60sk? <g>

No, none that I'm aware of.
