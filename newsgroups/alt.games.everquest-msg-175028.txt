Smithing modifiers don't stack, so having two items with a 5% modifier will
give you... a modifier of 5%.

Fortunately, I have the Hammer of the Ironfrost.  =)

In a way it's almost unbalancing to have this... I was doing Heraldic with a
raw skill of 212 when most other blacksmiths had to spend a lot more time
getting their smithing up in the 240's.

Still, if SOE's gonna put it in the game, I'm gonna use it with a clear
conscience.  =)
