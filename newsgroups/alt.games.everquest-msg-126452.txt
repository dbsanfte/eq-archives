Even a report is generally useless if you're going to
try to prove kill stealing.  That's why the official
response to a kill steal is almost always "If *I* (the
GM/guide) didn't *see* it, it didn't happen."

(A report only shows 10 lines.  What's the line(s) before
that? The other melee hitting the mob or the "other_player
begins to cast a spell" messages you don't want to send,
of course...)
