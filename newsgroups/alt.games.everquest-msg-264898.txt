Not really. The encryption stuff is already available in opensource 
api's; all they have to do is use it.

Given the package would be checksummed and keyed from a safe source 
there isn't really much fear of there being 'massive attacks'.

Sure.

The reality is there is unlikely to be a real need to even 'archive' 
inactive characters. Data storage is cheap. 10 or 20 or 120 accounts 
would not be that bad.

4 is too low. 6-10 would be much better, more would be better still. I 
won't play a game that won't let me create enough characters to try 
everything out.
