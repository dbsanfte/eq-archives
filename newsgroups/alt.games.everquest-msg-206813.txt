Since your druid can heal the new cleric here's what I would do:

1) Twink the cleric with some nice armor (Validus Custodus isn't that hard
to get) and a nice hammer like the Dark Ember (or try to get a summoned
hammer of divinity if they haven't been nerfed.)
2) Go kill some yellows or low reds.
3) Figure out how much damage your lower level nukes do and when the mob
gets below 50 pc health you can nuke it dead. But be careful -- I think its
actually the amount of damage your nuke does, not how much health the mob
has left that determines who gets the kill. You don't want to KS yourself.
4) Avoid the higher reds since they are tedious to kill with a youngster
even if you can keep him killed
5) Make hotkeys for /tar NoobCleric and /assist NoobCleric so you can find
him easily.

I'm PLing a tank (my main is a cleric) so I go to eqatlas.com and figure out
where the best hunting is for my level. I'm also using this is an excuse to
visit all the cool places I missed in the past.
