I did read it, and as a 52 druid, I think they are asking for too
much.

I can see asking for a slight bump in healing prowess, particularly
compared to paladins.  This seems fair.  A single target PoG I'm all
for.  The only change to the epic I can see would be to put it on the
same resistance check as the other druid conjuration DoT's.

Other than that, I think they're getting greedy.  Particularly this
part:

Druids don't need a teleport to Luclin, Wizards need their Luclin TP's
opened up to be useful on Norrath as well as Luclin.  Teleports are a
Wizard thing, this is why they get more, and more useful, teleport
spells.  On the old world, we can move about with impunity.  Luclin,
well, we get the same short end of the stick that every other class
gets.

And anyway, druids can still play evac'er, particularly with the new
Lesser Succor spell.  No, it's not as effective, particularly in some
zones, as just taking everybody to a nice TOTALLY safe spot like S.
Ro, but it's still useful.

That said, maybe druids aren't *necessary* in high end raid
situations, but they are still plenty effective in normal grouping
situation.  My 52 druid regularly groups with several level 55 and
over tanks and is more than welcome.  If I'm the only healer, we do
tend to be a lot more careful, but that's how it goes.  Hell, a druid
makes a pretty good back up healer while the cleric meds up a bit for
CHeal if nothing else.
