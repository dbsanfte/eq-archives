   I know this is an exercise in futility.  We both see this issue
differently, and we're not changing either one of our minds.  But just for
kicks, let's do a simple exercise in risk assessment.  Yes, I know that the
premise of this whole thing is pretty silly.  Put your "suspension of
disbelief" option on high.

   You and I, Wolfie, have been invited to appear on the first episode of
the new Fox game show, "Bet with your Life".  The rules are complicated,
and I'm sure that won't do a good job explaining them.  Please bear with
me, though.  They have two giant wheels, similar to the type on "Wheel of
Fortune".  One wheel has various dollar amounts on it, the other has
various odds on it.  A contestant spins both of the wheels.  They will win
a chance to win the dollar amount they land on.  But the catch is, they
have whatever the odds are against them that they will be shot in the head
live on TV (you can see why this is on Fox).  I know I'm not explaining it
too well, but maybe this example might clear it up.

  You win the coin flip for the first turn, and wheels come up $1,000 with
1.0% odds.  You can accept this bet, and the host (let's say Bob Saget!)
pushes a random generator that he now programs to flash a big red light
1.0% of the time (yeah, I know, it's hard to make a truly random
generator.  But Fox as an unlimited budget, and actually managed to pull it
off!  And somehow teach Bob Saget how to use it correctly.)  If the light
doesn't flash when the music ends, you get the cash.  Red light flashes,
you get to see Bob smile big as he blows you away.  Or... you can just say
that you don't like the odds, and forfeit that turn with no money, no
chance for a bullet, and no penalty of any kind.

   I'm going to assume that you don't like these odds, and take the
forfeit.  Bob smiles at you, then me, and asks if I want to take your odds
for you now.  You know what?  I'm going to decline that bet too.  Sure,
1.0% isn't very much.  That's only one out of a hundred, after all, and Bob
is only going to program the light once.  But like you, I don't think that
even that long shot is worth a measly $1000 bucks.

   So after commercial break, it's my turn.  I spin the wheels and come up
with $10,000,000 at .00001% odds.  Everyone in the audience gasps.  I'm not
that good at math, so I can't figure out quickly how that translates as to
1 in a whatever chances, but I know it is very slim.  

   Do you think that I should take the bet?  Because I would surely tell
Bob to push the button.  If Bob decided to give you the same exact odds,
would you take the bet?

   I know this isn't a perfect analogy for the lunchroom thing; but I do
think it is a fair way to portray risk assessment.
