Again, granted.  I rarely read manuals for anything, prefer to just slap 
keys until summat happens.  And yeah, if I'm on a flight sim or somthing 
where the keys are guessable (for eg, G as a good first port of call for 
landing gear), then 's cool.

But there again, it's an online game, wi lots of people.  You start 
flappng around at stuff and ye might attack summat, get et by summat, or 
insult someone, or anything.  'S like when I'm at work.  Love nothing more 
than careerin around a new system or prog to see what it does, but durn't 
do it at work cos will fluff summat important up and then in trouble.  
See?  :o)

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
