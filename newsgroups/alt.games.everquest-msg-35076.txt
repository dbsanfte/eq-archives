A lot of the vellious helms are no graphic.  It was originally a bug, in
which the helmet textures just wouldn't be displayed.  Rather than fix it,
verant created a work around.  Some Vellious helms with no graphic (and
others, which default to an old word graphic) can be traded in to certain
NPC's who ill then give you a custom <your helm name here> which will
display the hideous new Velious helm graphics, and on occasion, bug out, and
appar as if you are wearing both an old world helm, and a Velious helm on
top of it.  (Un)Fortunately, the Crusty helm isn't one that is tradeable for
one with a graphic.
