I did not play when it was first released, I started between Kunark and 
Velious.  You still had to run most anywhere you wanted to get to, when 
soloing, you had to med a lot, and, I never quit the game.  Personally, I 
really did enjoy the feeling of a big wide world, and that it took time 
to get to places as a result.
