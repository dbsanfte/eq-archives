To compound the complications of the issue, EDGE is not one of the 
magazines I keep after I read  them (these days only Fortean Times 
qualifies for the honor), so I can't go back and double-check.

Still, it's easier for me to believe that someone may had read the 
article quickly and missed that quote, than for me to have made it up out 
of thin air as I was reading it, because I distinctly remember reading it 
*before* the whole web brouhaha.
