There's a banker in runneyeye because there is a 'city' of goblins.  I see
no city in befallen.  Just skellies.  If there was a banker added with no
plausible reason such as there is in runneyeye or chardok then it would go
to the theory of designer corruption.  That said, I dont believe there is or
ever was one.
