I wish I saw this before. The OP should have quoted the EULA, probably
heard it from some wannabe lawyer, or some EQW
developer/supporter/user.

Telling them to look at the EULA is pointless. It's like saying to a
chicken, here is the lease to your henhouse, does it meet with your
approval?

I can say as a software developer, MS has a label program, it does
make check to code to see it meets standards to get a icon (Win
compatable) on the box. You are NOT required to meet that standard,
but then you can't use the icon.

Disallowing windowing does not interfere with multitasking, but even
if it did, that does NOT violate any standard from MS. It also doesn't
violate the EULA.

Some may say, "EQW is my right." It is your right, but it is VI's
right to say you can't play on thier servers using it. If you want to
use it, go find a server that allows it.
