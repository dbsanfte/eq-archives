You can quite easily grab some jasper earrings. Electrum can be had in
almost any zone for less than 10p each as the trivial for it is quite low.
+2 WIS. Better than that it becomes harder to find jewelers that can make
it. (I bagged a GBS so went shopping for plat WIS gear with it. There are
-very- few jewelers that are A: In EC, B: Of a skill level to make it and
C: not greedy enough to try and sell me two plat jasper bracers and call
it an even trade for a GBS, although I did enjoy laughing in his face)

For the rest? Not much in your level range you can get that you don't
already have. (The biggy being the Testament) There are other nice items
you'll be able to aquire on your own when you get into your mid 30s. Right
now in your 20s it's not that big of a deal, as +WIS items being nice,
they're not providing you with much mana _yet_. (Don't turn them down
certainly, but don't stop exp hunting to get them either) Once you hit 29
and get your first set of group ports, you'll be making enough money to
buy what you can't earn anyway.

Go to http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ , do a couple of searches, assemble
a nice shopping list.
