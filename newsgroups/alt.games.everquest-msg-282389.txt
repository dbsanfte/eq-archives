I never gave them 5 minutes.  If I got back something other than a
variant on "ok, sorry to bother you" I put them on ignore.

That being said, I was almost never anon for 56 levels as a druid and
66 levels as an enchanter, and I can only recall a handful of times
where I really got hassled.

My other tactic, when I got a "can you tp me to X" was to say "yes".
Then after a few minutes I'd get "I'm at spot Y" to which I'd reply
"I'm at spot Z".  After a few exchanges like that the would-be portee
would catch on that I wasn't planning on crossing a bunch of zone just
to function as his personal taxi service.  Probably put me on HIS
ignore list :)

I suppose I was a bit more mercenary than you.  I solo'ed a lot and if
someone was willing to pay me for my time, I was happy to take 5
minutes to port them.
