I recently got jewelry up to 250.  Almost the entire time I built
the skill by making the least expensive item that wasn't trivial.
Sometimes I would jump ahead an item or two, not because I was
convinced it would build the skill faster, but just to break the
monotony.  You can really get sick of making the same thing
literally hundreds of times in a row just to get one skill point.

If I had it to do over again, I think I would have waited until
I was able to get my Intelligence higher before starting JC.
My INT was around 130 when I started JC, it's now 200.

Enchanting every bar before making something with it will take
much more time, but cost you less, because vendors will pay you
a little more for an enchanted item than for an unenchanted item.

After Intelligence, Charisma is the next most important attribute.
Always keep your best Charisma buff active while you make jewelry.

While you're building the skill, auction the things that you are
comfortable making and are somewhat popular.  Selling things will
save you money.

Just my 2cp.
