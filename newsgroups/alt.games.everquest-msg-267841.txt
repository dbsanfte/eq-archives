It's weird.  I got aggro when running past some mobs, and started running.
I ran by someone else, and the mobs switched to her.  She was AFK, and did
not fight back.

I then started healing her while the mobs beat on her.  A couple times, the
mobs stopped beating on her and started to run to me, but then quickly went
back to her.  I tried nuking them to get their attention, but the nukes did
no damage, and did not draw them away.

Then I turned on autoattack and ran up to the mobs.  That got them away from
her.  I backed away, and they followed a bit, then stopped, and just stood
there, between me and her, attacking neither of us.

After a few minutes of this, I left, and they did not follow, and did not
seem to be interested in going after her, either.
