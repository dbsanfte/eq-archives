What I don't get is WTF information can their competition glean
from knowing how many players are on in EQ? How can that
possibly help them?

The mind boggles at the stupidity of this move. Hmmm yeah lets
take away a nice feature from our player base to screw over
our competition for information they 'might' somehow use.
