Hw abut a level 23 ranger in Paludal (who, mindyou was 1: using a 
shield, and 2: NOT using a bow) who kept yelling and ranting all over 
the zone, spamming "invite me" and "invite me plz" to an already full 
group that was too low for him anyway, and when he finally left, 
Proceeded to walk to the other end of PC, where he began doing the same 
thing to a Good necro friend of mine who was Light blue to me (and thus 
green to him, i was only level 20, she was 14) and hitting the invite 
button a million times a second at her? And then an hour later I got a 
message from a guide saying he petitioned me and told the guide that I 
was Killstealing his "camp" at C1! Jeeez, i almost flipped. /ignore for 
Dedu on innoruuk.
