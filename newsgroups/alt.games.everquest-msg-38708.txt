You just dont get it . When I leveled up the first time with my druid I was
completely and totally flat ass broke till 40 . I had to PICK which of my
spells I needed the most . When I first zoned into fear I did so in mostly
raw hide leather . You are completely ignoring the fact that I KNOW exactly
how much easier a new player has it . The difficulty level when I started
was a 10 now its about a 3 . Yes im perfectly well aware that many, and it
sounds like you are among them , think that the game set on easy is still to
hard . wahhh , wahhh.
