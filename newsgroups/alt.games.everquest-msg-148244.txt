Hi all,
I know there was a thread on this about 5 months ago, but 5 months is
a long time in technology land...things may have improved since then

I am *finally* gonna upgrade my machine to the 21st Century.  I am
happy that the spec (P4 2.66, 1GB PC800RAM, GeForce4 Ti 4600 blah blah
blah) will cut the mustard for EQ, but I am wondering about the
monitor and whether to go for a flat panel or not.

I can go for a 19" CRT which I know will be great for EQ, but it is a
beast sizewise and my PCs are set up in the "spare" bedroom whose cat
swingability factor is less than favourable.

There are a couple of FP monitors I can buy (the system is a
Dell)...the 1702FP, the 1800FP.  The 1900FP and 2000FP are WAY out of
my budget.

Has anyone been using either the 1702 / 1800 Dell FP monitors, and are
they ok for EQ?

TIA,

Tzen
