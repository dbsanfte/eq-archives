SUBJECT     Recent Congressional Hearing on Internet Security

On March 22, the Subcommittee on Science of the House Science,
Space and Technology Committee (chaired by Rick Boucher) held a
hearing on Internet security.  The stimulus for the hearing was
the well-publicized recent Internet security advisory issued by
the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), a government-funded
organization to coordinate responses to computer security
emergencies.

At Tab A is a summary and analysis, prepared by my staff, of the
issues raised at the hearing. It notes that the recent break-ins
on host systems connected to the Internet have emphasized the
need for deployment of digital signature technology.  (Questions
were asked during the hearing about the status of NIST's
proposed Digital Signature System (DSS) -- currently subject to
a patent infringement claim.) The recent Internet attacks may
also intensify pressure to resolve any outstanding concerns
about possible "digital telephony" legislation and the "Clipper"
standard.

Associate Director for Computer Security). We also have copies
of the other witness' testimony; please let me know if you would
like to see them. NIST would be pleased to provide you a more
detailed briefing if you so desire. Mr. Gary, Manager of CERT,
stressed that the recent spate of attacks involved the use of
encryption techniques to protect the monitoring dam, targeting
of "network service providers," and gaining access to systems
critical to the network.

March 22 CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ON INTERNET SECURITY

On March 22, 1994, the Subcommittee on Science of the House
Science, Space and Technology Committee (chaired by Rick
Boucher) held a hearing on Internet security. The stimulus for
the hearing was the highly publicized recent Internet security
advisory issued by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT),
a government-funded organization to coordinate responses to
computer security emergencies. The witnesses included NIST, the
FBI, and representatives of the Internet Society and the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

CAUSES OF THE RECENT EMERGENCY

The testimony of L. Dain Gary, Manager of CERT, suggested that
the recent spate of attacks on Internet host computers indicates
a new level of sophistication and power in the methods used by
computer system intruders. His testimony outlines the
progression from what might be called a "standard attack," to an
attack installing a secret system monitor, and finally, to an
attack using more subtle and dangerous forms of secret
monitoring or intrusion.

Gary explained that intruders commonly dial up a system offering
Internet access, or they have direct access to a system on the
Internet. From such a host, they run programs that scan other
computer systems on the network to identify which network
services those computer services offer (e-mail, telnet, and so
forth). If the host computer is offering services that are
sometimes vulnerable, the intruders probe for known
vulnerabilities that have not been corrected. Once access has
been obtained, the intruders attempt to obtain "privileged"
access (the powers of a system administrator), with which the
system can be subverted in different ways.

In July, 1993, a "fairly standard" attack occurred in which the
intruders gained privileged access and then: (1) installed and
started a network monitoring program; (2) installed a "back
door" to the system to their entry at will to collect the
results of their monitoring activity; and (3) modified the
system's utility programs to conceal their activities and their
network monitor.

Attacks of this nature became more common in late 1993. To
remedy this problem, CERT, NIST, the Internet Society, and
others intensified their efforts to educate systems
administrators to implement known "fixes" to eliminate the
system vulnerabilities that permit unauthorized access.


The most recent spate of attacks, according to Mr. Gary, were
different because they involved some use of encryption
techniques to protect the data gathered through the secret
monitoring, and because they targeted "network service
providers" that serve many individual users. Gary also mentioned
that the intruders gained access to systems critical to the host
networks.

Differing in emphasis from Mr. Gary's account, the testimony of
Lynn McNulty, NIST's Associate Director for Computer Security,
focused on the compromise of user passwords as the key feature
of the recent spate of attacks.  McNulty stressed the use of
"sniffer" programs to monitor the target system for log-in
information, including passwords. (The "password sniffer"
technique is particularly dangerous because it allows an
intruder on a vulnerable system to access other computer systems
that are properly configured and which have employed all the
recommended "fixes" to address known vulnerabilities.) The
representatives of the Internet Engineering Task Force (Stephen
Crocker) and the Internet Society (Vinton Cerf) also stressed
the password security problem as the main novel threat.

IMPLICATIONS OF 'PASSWORD SNIFFER" ATTACKS FOR NIST AND THE
INTERNET COMMUNITY

In general. Most systems on the Internet employ re-usable
passwords. The expert consensus is that the "sniffer" programs
have made re-usable passwords obsolete. Therefore, more
sophisticated authentication methods must be devised and/or
implemented. Until such systems are in place, the recent spate
of attacks must be viewed as a continuing threat -- not a
resolved problem.

Implications for NIST. The basic alternative to the re-usable
password is some form of "challenge-response" system. As
explained by the IETF witness, in such a system --

... there is still a shared secret, but it is not transmitted
over the network.  Instead, when the user attempts to connect to
a remote computer, the remote computer sends the user a randomly
chosen number. The user must demonstrate that he knows the
shared secret by scrambling the random number in accordance with
the shared secret.

"Smart cards" are one approach to a challenge-response system
that can substitute for re-usable passwords. The experts seem to
agree that any highly secure authentication method (whether or
not using smart cards) that could be viable in the near-term
future will have to include digital signatures. Methods based on
sensing an individual's person, such as fingerprints,
voiceprints or other types of "bio-sensors," are either
generally unavailable or not cost-effective at present.


The recent security problems therefore emphasize the need to
deploy digital signature technology, and thus for NIST to move
ahead with adoption of a digital signature standard. (Mr.
McNulty says that a Committee member asked about NIST's proposed
"Digital Signature Standard" (DSS), action on which has been
delayed due to a patent infringement claim. )

As pointed out by the IETF witness, "... this set of incidents
tells us that protecting passwords is not enough. The same
sniffer technology makes it possible to simply record
"interesting" messages. Even if we improve the protection of
passwords, we will shortly need to protect all of the traffic on
networks," This perceived need will increase the demand for
improved encryption solutions, and in turn will emphasize the
public's need to choose whether to adopt the Clipper technology
for private systems, as is the government's hope, or to use
alternative systems -- the most popular and powerful of which
(including the Digital Encryption Standard (DES)) are subject to
export controls. Considering that the Interact is a worldwide
apparatus, this increased demand for low-cost, highly secure
encryption can be expected to focus even greater public and
Congressional attention on encryption issues, including export
controls.

Excerpts follow from the U.S. District Court's (Seattle) May 23, 2001 Order
in U.S.A. v. Gorshkov, et.al.

    "This matter comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Suppress
Seized Computer Data. Defendant moves this Court for an order suppressing
all computer data . . . . seized by federal agents . . . . on or about
December 1, 2000 . . . from two computers located in Russia . . . .

    "Following an extensive national investigation of a series of computer
hacker intrusions into the computer systems of businesses in the United
States emanating from Russia, Alexey Ivanov was identified as one of the
intruders. Around June 2000 the FBI set up Invita, a "sting" computer
security company in Seattle. On/about November 10, 2000 Mr. Ivanov, along
with his "business partner," Defendant Vasiliy Gorshkov, flew from Russia to
SeaTac."

    "In Seattle, the two men met with undercover FBI agents at the Invita
office located in Seattle. During the meeting and at the behest of the FBI,
Defendant Gorshkov used an FBI IBM Thinkpad computer ("IBM") ostensibly to
demonstrate his computer hacking and computer security skills and to access
his computer system, "tech.net.ru," in Russia. After the meeting, both
Gorshkov and Ivanov were arrested."

    "Following the Defendants' arrest, without Defendant Gorshkov's
knowledge or consent, the FBI searched and seized the IBM and all key
strokes made by the Defendant while he used it, by means of a "sniffer"
program which allowed the FBI to track and store the information. The FBI
thereby obtained the Defendant's computer user name and password that he had
used to access the Russian computer."

    "Armed with this information the FBI logged onto the subject computer(s)
located in Russia. Faced with the possibilitty that a confederate of the
defendant could destroy the files in the Russian computer, the FBI decided
to download the file contents of the subject computer(s). This was done
without reading same until after a search warrant was obtained."

    "The FBI's downloading and copying of the downloaded data onto CD disk
format took until November 21. The warrant was applied for and obtained on
December 1, 2000. The delay between the downloading of the data and the
procurement of the warrant was due to the slow process of obtaining approval
and permission from FBI headquarters and the Department of Justice."

    "A. The FBI Did Not Violate the Fourth Amendment by Obtaining
Defendant's Password."

    "B. The FBI Did Not Violate the Fourth Amendment By Accessing the
Russian Computers and Downloading Data."


    " . . . .the Court hereby denies the Motion."

*                                                     *


    This order and the underlying case suggest the following conclusions.
Computer security platforms present an interesting academic exercise.
Computer security remains an elusive target however, in the real world. That
oldest of human experiences, the little white lie, defeats computer security
effectively.

    "And the serpent said to the woman. 'Surely you shall not die, for on
the day you eat of the tree of knowledge you shall become as gods, knowing
good and evil."

    One might be inclined to preserve the computer security paradigm by
assigning a gullibility tag to these defendants. Such a tag would inexorably
have universal application however, since trust in others defines the human
experience.

This Sniffer FAQ will hopefully give administrators a clear understanding of
sniffing problems and hopefully possible solutions to follow up with. Sniffers
is one of the main causes of mass break-ins on the Internet today.

This FAQ will be broken down into:

   *  What a sniffer is and how it works
   *  Where are sniffers available
   *  How to detect if a machine is being sniffed
   *  Stopping sniffing attacks:
        o  Active hubs
        o  Encryption
        o  Kerberos
        o  One-time password technology
        o  Non-promiscuous interfaces

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What a sniffer is and how it works

Unlike telephone circuits, computer networks are shared communication channels.
It is simply too expensive to dedicate local loops to the switch (hub) for each
pair of communicating computers. Sharing means that computers can receive
information that was intended for other machines. To capture the information
going over the network is called sniffing.

Most popular way of connecting computers is through ethernet. Ethernet protocol
works by sending packet information to all the hosts on the same circuit. The
packet header contains the proper address of the destination machine. Only the
machine with the matching address is suppose to accept the packet. A machine
that is accepting all packets, no matter what the packet header says, is said
to be in promiscuous mode.

Because, in a normal networking environment, account and password information
is passed along ethernet in clear-text, it is not hard for an intruder once
they obtain root to put a machine into promiscuous mode and by sniffing,
compromise all the machines on the net.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where are sniffers available

Sniffing is one of the most popular forms of attacks used by hackers. One
special sniffer, called Esniff.c, is very small, designed to work on Sunos, and
only captures the first 300 bytes of all telnet, ftp, and rlogin sessions. It
was published in Phrack, one of the most widely read freely available
underground hacking magazines. You can find Phrack on many FTP sites. Esniff.c
is also available on many FTP sites such as coombs.anu.edu.au:/pub/net/log.

You may want to run Esniff.c on an authorized network to quickly see how
effective it is in compromising local machines.

Other sniffers that are widely available which are intended to debug network
problems are:

   *  Etherfind on SunOs4.1.x
   *  Snoop on Solaris 2.x and SunOs 4.1 (on ftp playground.sun.com)
   *  Tcpdump 3.0 uses bpf for a multitude of platforms.
   *  Packetman, Interman, Etherman, Loadman works on the following platforms:
     SunOS, Dec-Mips, SGI, Alpha, and Solaris. It is available on
     ftp.cs.curtin.edu.au:/pub/netman/[sun4c|dec-mips|sgi|alpha|solaris2]/
     [etherman-1.1a|interman-1.1|loadman-1.0|packetman-1.1].tar.Z
     Packetman was designed to capture packets, while Interman, Etherman, and
     Loadman monitor traffic of various kinds.

     DOS based sniffers

   *  Gobbler for IBM DOS Machines
   *  ethdump v1.03
     Available on ftp
     ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/networking/inet/ethernet/ethdp103.zip
   *  ethload v1.04
     Companion utility to a ethernet monitor. Available on ftp
     ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/networking/monitoring/ethload/ethld104.zip

Commercial Sniffers are available at:

   *  Network General.

          Network General produces a number of products. The most
          important are the Expert Sniffer, which not only sniffs on the
          wire, but also runs the packet through a high-performance expert
          system, diagnosing problems for you. There is an extension onto
          this called the "Distributed Sniffer System" that allows you to
          put the console to the expert sniffer on you Unix workstation
          and to distribute the collection agents at remote sites.

   *  Microsoft's Net Monitor

          " My commercial site runs many protocols on one wire - NetBeui,
          IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, 802.3 protocols of various flavors, most
          notably SNA. This posed a big problem when trying to find a
          sniffer to examine the network problems we were having, since I
          found that some sniffers that understood Ethernet II parse out
          some 802.3 traffic as bad packets, and vice versa. I found that
          the best protocol parser was in Microsoft's Net Monitor product,
          also known as Bloodhound in its earlier incarnations. It is able
          to correctly identify such oddities as NetWare control packets,
          NT NetBios name service broadcasts, etc, which etherfind on a
          Sun simply registered as type 0000 packet broadcasts. It
          requires MS Windows 3.1 and runs quite fast on a HP XP60 Pentium
          box. Top level monitoring provides network statistics and
          information on conversations by mac address (or hostname, if you
          bother with an ethers file). Looking at tcpdump style details is
          as simple as clicking on a conversation. The filter setup is
          also one of the easiest to implement that I've seen, just click
          in a dialog box on the hosts you want to monitor. The number of
          bad packets it reports on my network is a tiny fraction of that
          reported by other sniffers I've used. One of these other
          sniffers in particular was reporting a large number of bad
          packets with src mac addresses of aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa but I don't
          see them at all using the MS product. - Anonymous

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to detect a sniffer running.

To detect a sniffing device that only collects data and does not respond to any
of the information, requires physically checking all your ethernet connections
by walking around and checking the ethernet connections individually.

It is also impossible to remotely check by sending a packet or ping if a
machine is sniffing.

A sniffer running on a machine puts the interface into promiscuous mode, which
accepts all the packets. On some Unix boxes, it is possible to detect a
promiscuous interface. It is possible to run a sniffer in non-promiscuous mode,
but it will only capture sessions from the machine it is running on. It is also
possible for the intruder to do similiar capture of sessions by trojaning many
programs such as sh, telnet, rlogin, in.telnetd, and so on to write a log file
of what the user did. They can easily watch the tty and kmem devices as well.
These attacks will only compromise sessions coming from that one machine, while
promiscuous sniffing compromises all sessions on the ethernet.

For SunOs, NetBSD, and other possible BSD derived Unix systems, there is a
command

     "ifconfig -a"

that will tell you information about all the interfaces and if they are in
promiscuous mode. DEC OSF/1 and IRIX and possible other OSes require the device
to be specified. One way to find out what interface is on the system, you can
execute:

     # netstat -r
     Routing tables

     Internet:
     Destination      Gateway            Flags     Refs     Use  Interface
     default          iss.net            UG          1    24949  le0
     localhost        localhost          UH          2       83  lo0

Then you can test for each interface by doing the following command:

     #ifconfig le0
     le0: flags=8863
             inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 255.0.0.1

Intruders often replace commands such as ifconfig to avoid detection. Make sure
you verify its checksum.

There is a program called cpm available on ftp.cert.org:/pub/tools/cpm that
only works on Sunos and is suppose to check the interface for promiscuous flag.

Ultrix can possibly detect someone running a sniffer by using the commands
pfstat and pfconfig.

pfconfig allows you to set who can run a sniffer
pfstat shows you if the interface is in promiscuous mode.

These commands only work if sniffing is enabled by linking it into the kernel.
by default, the sniffer is not linked into the kernel. Most other Unix systems,
such as Irix, Solaris, SCO, etc, do not have any flags indication whether they
are in promiscuous mode or not, therefore an intruder could be sniffing your
whole network and there is no way to detect it.

Often a sniffer log becomes so large that the file space is all used up. On a
high volume network, a sniffer will create a large load on the machine. These
sometimes trigger enough alarms that the administrator will discover a sniffer.
I highly suggest using lsof (LiSt Open Files) available from
coast.cs.purdue.edu:/pub/Purdue/lsof for finding log files and finding programs
that are accessing the packet device such as /dev/nit on SunOs.

There is no commands I know of to detect a promiscuous IBM PC compatible
machine, but they atleast usually do not allow command execution unless from
the console, therefore remote intruders can not turn a PC machine into a
sniffer without inside assistance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stopping sniffing attacks

Active hubs send to each system only packets intended for it rendering
promiscuous sniffing useless. This is only effective for 10-Base T.

The following vendors have available active hubs:

   *  3Com
   *  HP

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Encryption

There are several packages out there that allow encryption between connections
therefore an intruder could capture the data, but could not decypher it to make
any use of it.

Some packages available are:

   *  deslogin is one package available at ftp
     coast.cs.purdue.edu:/pub/tools/unix/deslogin .

   * swIPe is another package available at
     ftp.csua.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks/swIPe/

   * Netlock encrypts all (tcp, udp, and raw ip based) communications
     transparently. It has automatic (authenticated Diffie-Helman) distibuted
     key management mechanism for each host and runs on the SUN 4.1 and HP 9.x
     systems. The product comes with a Certification Authority Management
     application which generates host certificates (X.509) used for
     authentication between the hosts. and provides centralized control of each
     Hosts communications rules.

     The product is built by Hughes Aircraft and they can be reached at
     800-825-LOCK or email at netlock@mls.hac.com.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kerberos

Kerberos is another package that encrypts account information going over the
network. Some of its draw backs are that all the account information is held on
one host and if that machine is compromised, the whole network is vulnerable.
It is has been reported a major difficulty to set up. Kerberos comes with a
stream-encrypting rlogind, and stream-encrypting telnetd is available. This
prevents intruders from capturing what you did after you logged in.

There is a Kerberos FAQ at ftp at rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/comp.protocols/kerberos/Kerberos_Users__Frequently_Asked_Questions_1.11

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One time password technology

S/key and other one time password technology makes sniffing account information
almost useless. S/key concept is having your remote host already know a
password that is not going to go over insecure channels and when you connect,
you get a challenge. You take the challenge information and password and plug
it into an algorithm which generates the response that should get the same
answer if the password is the same on the both sides. Therefore the password
never goes over the network, nor is the same challenge used twice. Unlike
SecureID or SNK, with S/key you do not share a secret with the host. S/key is
available on ftp:thumper.bellcore.com:/pub/nmh/skey

Other one time password technology is card systems where each user gets a card
that generates numbers that allow access to their account. Without the card, it
is improbable to guess the numbers.

The following are companies that offer solutions that are provide better
password authenication (ie, handheld password devices):

OneTime Pass (OTP):
This program provides unrestricted one-time pass codes on a user by user basis
without any need for cryptographic protocols or hardware devices. The user
takes a list of usable pass codes and scratches out each one as it is used. The
system tracks usage, removing each passcode from the available list when it is
used. Comes with a very small and fast password tester and password and pass
phrase generation systems.

A Nederland-based Internet company was back online Wednesday after 11 
days during which executives say their service was held hostage by a 
skilled European hacker making political and monetary demands. 


"He did solicit money, but I think he's more motivated by the 
politics," said Joseph Vigorito, owner and administrator of Eagle 
Network. The hacker, identified only as Bulgarianboy, demanded that 
the Web site antiwar.com be taken offline, Vigorito said. 


Eagle Network, which has an environmental bent, services 100 Web sites 
and has 220 customers for its e-mail service, eagle-access.net. 


Vigorito said he reported the matter to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation and was referred to agent John May of the Computer 
Emergency Response Team. May said he could not comment. 


The Internet company went down on Oct. 1, when someone took control of 
the router, which acts as a kind of switchboard for the system, 
executives said. Technicians working on the machine were unable to get 
back in and lock the intruder out. 


"It's not supposed to be able to happen," Vigorito said. "If this guy 
posts how he actually did this, the whole Internet's wide open." 
Vigorito said he will have to replace his $18,000 router because of 
damage. He is moving his hardware to a new location in Lafayette where 
he can place the entire system behind a protective digital firewall, 
he said. 


"What happened to Joe was pretty fascinating," said Rob Savoye, a 
Nederland software developer who helped get Eagle Network back up and 
running. 


I've never heard of anyone being extorted for money to get (back) 
control of their computer." 


First the hacker set up a password "sniffer" to get access to the 
system, technicians said. Once in, he used a buffer overflow to 
overload the server. 


At that point, he had the administrative password for the router and 
told the machine to block outside access from customers. 


To that point, the attack was reasonably sophisticated but not 
exceptional, Savoye said. 


But the reason clients were locked out so long, Savoye said, was that 
the hacker crippled the router in such a way that Eagle Network 
technicians couldn't change the password back. 


Savoye said the hacker, or cracker, as he said malicious hackers are 
known, erased his fingerprints too fast for Savoye to track him beyond 
Ripe.net in Amsterdam, although it is possible he used computers in 
Bosnia or Germany. 


"He's definitely the more professional of the people I've seen in the 
last few years," Savoye said. 


It is not unusual for a hacker to develop a gripe against an Internet 
service provider because of the content on a Web site it hosts, said 
Richard Power of the San Francisco-based Computer Security Institute. 
Because service providers offer access to lots of people, he said, 
they are particularly vulnerable. 


"They are big, fat juicy targets because there's lots of activity," 


Power said. 


But it is unusual for an intruder to harm hardware, said Rik Farrow, a 
security expert with the Computer Security Institute. 


"It's really rare to disable a piece of equipment," Farrow said. "You 
hear about viruses and so on that could do that, but in reality it 
hardly ever happens." Antiwar.com, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has 
attracted at least three major hacking attacks in the past six months, 
said webmaster Eric Garris. 


The site, which is affiliated with the Center for Libertarian Studies, 
focuses in part on the Balkans. Garris moved his site from Eagle 
Network to a larger Internet service provider specializing in security 
a week ago. 


"Although I'm grateful to Joe for everything he did, " Garris said, "I 
think he's probably going to be relieved."

The review this reputible website gave it was:


"The most efficient and reliable password sniffer! Win Sniffer allows network
administrators to capture passwords of any network user. Win Sniffer monitor
incoming and outcoming network traffic and decode FTP, POP3, HTTP, ICQ, SMTP,
Telnet, IMAP, NNTP passwords."

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
