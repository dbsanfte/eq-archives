Get real people. Tim Smith is right.
The component asks to be installed - it contains digital certification
that it is indeed from Sony verified by RSA (IIRC) - so I think you
can be fairly sure its no more melicious that the game itself and
probably much less buggy as it is fairly simple.

My 2 cents.
