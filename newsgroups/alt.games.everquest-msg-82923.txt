: the classes and subclasses ?

There's no subclasses. There's just classes. Some are a mixture of others, though.
And yes, you can not play all of them to 60 unless you delete some others or
own two accounts.

: But it is possible for anyone to attack you anywhere or is there only "mutual
: consent"-hostility ?

Duel:	Two people consent to attack each other. No experience loss unless one
	gets killed by a DOT (Damage over Time) spell. Pretty stupid for classes
	that entirely base on DOT's.

PK:	You can become a playerkiller on safe servers. You can only attack other
	people that decided to be PK, though. No 'safe' player can attack you
	and you can't attack them. Unless you are both in an arena area.

Arena:	Some places in the world are arenas. Everybody kill everybody while in
	one.

PvP:	Some servers are entirely PvP. I don't know much about them, but they
	are based on religion/classes (good vs evil) or all against all I think.

: And who are these GM's c.q. who become one ?

Master GM's sit at Verant I guess ... Guides are people recruited from players
sometimes. They are selected by verant though, so in theory, the possibility
of meeting a total self-ruling jackass GM are minimal to non-existant. Some
are annoying, though.

: But I presume small identical items stack ? (like arrows, gems, maybe even
: rings and amulets)

Some smaller stuff does. Most things don't. You can not farm 300 swords and 
sell them.

Remember: EQ is *much* harder than diablo :)
