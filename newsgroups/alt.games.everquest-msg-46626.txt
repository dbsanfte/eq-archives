Ok, is there a palce to live through some easy levelling at 50+,
basically what you were used to from 1 to 45 or so. I'm not
talking about soloing things in DL etc .. i mean group. The
group always consists of a Shaman, Cleric, Chanter, Rogue
and Warrior (I said 4-6 cause sometimes one is sick and
we sometimes pick up a tank) .. suggestions? I heard KC
is very dangerous (despite the excellent loot), then
somebody mentione the hole... I know nothing of these
palces, as I hit 50 soon for the first time. Thanks!
