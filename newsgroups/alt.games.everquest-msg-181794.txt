    Hrm I *know* you can get skillups against a light blue mob, the only
thing I can think of, are you sure your defensive skills aren't hard up
against their caps for your current level?

    I'm keen to find out because I'm a mere 4 yellows from dinging 51, where
ALL my defensive skills get their caps moved up a bit, and have saved up
some nice agility gear for the sole purpose of tanking the weakest-hitting
mob i can find until my skills cap again :)

Regards,
James
