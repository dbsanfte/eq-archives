	Well, IMHO it's just as hard now, but rather than it being 
hard to get a character to level 12 without, say, falling through 
the ice in Everfrost and drowning 25 times trying to get your corpse :-)
it's hard to take your level 65 or 70 through DoN content... 

	It's just like real life.  When I was 25 it was hard to manage
a small department computer lab.  Now it's hard to manage I.T. for
a small multinational.  I sure don't want to go back to 1980 just
because the skills and tools I have now make it so much easier to
do that original task...  He he, "It's too easy now! Let's build
a company that only allows 300 baud acoustical couplers and dumb ASCII
terminals!"  No way .  :-)
