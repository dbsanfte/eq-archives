Dunno. DOn't mean to sound like I think you're stupid, but are you
looking at the actual HP numbers on your character screen, or are you
looking at the number that pops up if you hover your pointer over your
HP bar in the UI? Some custom UIs also show HP % in your player window
rather than total HP.
