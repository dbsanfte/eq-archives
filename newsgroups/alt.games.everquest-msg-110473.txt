What makes you think the decision is not purely emotional?

Nothing, they're making an emotional response to loss that is well
within the range of the human "norm".  Since choosing which character
to play in EQ is not exactly a survival issue there is no reason for
them to override their emotional response with another grounded in a
more dispassionate analysis of the situation.  Later, when emotions
have faded, they can go back and regear the character as the OP is
wanting to do.  Unless they deleted the character in a fit of pique
at the time they suffered the loss, in which case they get the
opportunity to learn how stupid it is to make irreversible choices
when they are angry.
