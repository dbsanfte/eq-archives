Ahhh Taras (you zany Ukranian, you!)  you must play on a better server.

I have never heard tells like those. I only hear:

hey dude, u busy? Can u tp me 2 wc?

hey bro, u busy? Can u tp me 2 wc?

or the variant

hey bud, u busy? Can u tp me 2 wc?

I'm sure everyone else has been offered Rezzes, Binds and Assists in the
manner you suggest, I just haven't been so lucky.
