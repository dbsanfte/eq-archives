Command is /makeleader <name>

Press the "L" key by default.  It'll bring up the list of abilities
you can buy with leadership points.  It also gives you the option to
turn off leadership points as 20% of your xp goes there.

Paludal has one of the highest (the highest?) mofifiers in the game
.., because of tht it draws everyone from miles around.  Good xp if
you can put up with the arguments about KSing and camp stealing that
seem to go on in /ooc al the time.

Careful with Befallen ... there is a system of keys to sections of the
dungeon.  If you get killed on far side of a locked door corpse
recovery can be tricky.

How's Lennie doing these days?  Met him regularly a while back...
haven't seen him recently.

ROFL .. nice.

I left my 18th level monk and went away for a year.  When I came back
the game had changed out of all recognition.  He still isn't 65
though.... got a ways to go.
