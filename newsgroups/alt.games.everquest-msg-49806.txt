this weekend I did the Brood Mother quest and the Treant Monk Fists .. both
were busted .. and it took 3 days for a guide ( not a GM ) to fess up that
the quests are bugged .. now I sit and wait to see what policy verant in all
its stupidty will operate .. its absolute bull shit to have to do them all
over again .. and the last time I did the Aegis .. it took that arsehole
company verant 3 months to acknowledge it was busted too !
