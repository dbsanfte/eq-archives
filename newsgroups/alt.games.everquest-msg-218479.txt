I've used this trick for ages, but don't think I've ever posted
it or seen it mentioned.

Autofollow can be very helpful in many circumstances,
particularly if you are slightly laggy or moving thru hilly or
twisty terrain.  

THe problem with it is that you follow at a fair distance, and
can easily lose your target due to that same lag, and due to
terrain.

But even worse, one principle reason for using autofollow is to
stay with a bard who is providing you with selos speed,
levitation, invisibility, or all of the above.

Problem is, his song range is just barely big enough to include
you on autofollow; lag or get stuck on terrain even a little bit
and you can find yourself moving too slow to keep up (and he's
crossed the other half the zone and zoned out before you can type
out a "lost me"), falling to your death, or visible and alone in
the midst of some really angry bad things.

First off, don't follow a bard, ever.  Have the bard follow YOU. 
This way at least if Selos drops you are ok; you slow down and
the bard catches up and you get selos again, no sweat.

But thats not good enough when its levitation or invisibility you
need; those need to be on you all the time or you might as well
not have them at all.

Here's my solution: autofollow, then manually hold down the "up
arrrow" key.  This will make you run forward until you literally
overrun your target's position, then you'll flip back and forth
trying to run past him both directions... if you don't let go of
the button while he's figuring out which direction to move.  But
assuming he keeps moving, what this does is make you run at your
full speed no matter how fast he's running, so you catch up every
time he slows up a little; with normal autofollow you will move
at his speed and only catch up at all when he stops; and you
won't catch up completely, only to autofollow distance.

The other trick, when follow distance is critical, is for the
person leading to put Walk on.  This reduces the danger of lag,
and since you are moving much faster than him you'll very easily
be able to stay in song range.

No biggie, just thought I'd share
