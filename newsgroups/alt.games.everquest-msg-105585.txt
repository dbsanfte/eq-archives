Ah, I see now...still though...kind of confusing.  Although, he does say the
40% is the measured damage output, not the speed increase.  I believe he's
saying that while haste DOES increase your attack speed, the measurements
given (21%, 40%) are measurements of increased damage output, not delay
decrease (or therefore speed increase).  That's what made the article so
confusing; his emphasis on damage output.  Here's a direct quote from the
article:

"An item or spell that adds a 40% Haste effect does NOT lower your weapons
Delay by 40%, but rather increases the amount of Damage you do by 40% over a
period of time."

But to me, it's clear that haste items do speed up your attack and you could
measure both speed increase and/or damage output.  He seems to be saying
that all measurements are damage output measurements.  I sort of have to
reject the argument that everyone is measuring damage output.  Perhaps some
are, but it seems people are more interested in speed increase measurements,
so I would think most haste measurements are based on speed increases.

The end for you perhaps.  I will continue to discuss the matter if I see fit
to do so.
