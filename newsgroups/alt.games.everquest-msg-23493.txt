Interesting how people are flaming me when I try to pass along something
good I've found. I also wasn't laying blame that I was bored with characters
because I twink and power level, that's a choice I make (when available, and
since I switched servers that choice isn't there to tempt me). The allusion
to 12 year olds and servers being over crowded was restricted to why I left
Sallon for Vallon and nothing else.
