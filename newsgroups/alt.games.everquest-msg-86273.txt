True enough.  AoE groups are fantastic XP since the kill rate
can skyrocket in comparison to mana outlay.  For normal XP
groups, though, that's just not going to happen.

Personally, I like having a wizard in my groups.  I don't try to
convince myself that it's an optimal group, though.  The fastest
XP groups I've been in weren't optimal because I was in them.
Optimal groups have a shaman who can contribute more to
the killing rate than my cleric does.  ;)
