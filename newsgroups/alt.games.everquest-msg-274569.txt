So you say.

But given that you also said you would abide by the rules, and you're now
demonstrating that you lied then, what's to say you're not lying now?

Violating the EULA doesn't make you good or bad, it makes you honest or a
liar.

Also, as what you "... care about is making some money...", it's obvious
that selling the same account several times will net you quite a bit more
money than will selling it only once.  Ergo, given that you're a
demonstrated liar, there's no reason in the world that we should believe
that you won't sell the account multiple times.

Then of course there's the detail of how do we know that what you *claim* to
be on the account actually is there?  For all we know you're lying through
your teeth (again) about what characters and gear are on the account.  If
you're willing to lie about one thing (obeying the EULA), there's nothing to
say you won't lie about everything.

You really should have said that there's at least one L70 character on the
account.  After all, what's it hurt you if you inflate levels by a few (or a
lot)?  You get more cash that way, and that's what's important, eh?
