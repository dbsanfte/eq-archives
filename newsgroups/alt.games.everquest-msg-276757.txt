Many people prioritize golf below other time-consuming activities, but 
still want to play with good equipment and high-level golfers. In golf 
at least you can buy the equipment, but that doesn't get you on the PGA 
tour. Perhaps we should all cry about how they should be able to get 
what they want and insist that be allowed on the tour?

Sadly in EQ, showing up with the equivlant of your own golf cart, and a 
set of hand built custom clubs will get you into the raiding guild over 
somebody else. In golf, at least, you'll be found out by your 2nd 
swing... in EQ you can coast on the equipment for as long as you don't 
do anything too stupid and keep a low profile.

You entered a multiplayer game. You play by the rules. Whether its golf 
or magic the gathering or autoracing money can only get you so far 
before you start violating the rules of the game.  In EQ money can be 
used to upgrade your PC, your internet connection, order you pizza and 
buy you a nice comfy chair... beyond that you earn your way up.

Those are the rules of the game. If you don't like them, don't play.

Actually, its against the rules in Everquest. Perhaps you should read 
them. The fact that people cheat hardly justifies cheating.

I can get pro ranked in golf too if I just pay someone enough to tweak 
my scorecards. Fortunately for golf they actively enforce those rules.
