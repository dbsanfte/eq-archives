Considering they sell for 30k in Sol Ro...it's a damn good deal.

He knew what I paid for it and offered me 20k, which I accepted.
He saved 10k and was ecstatic.

And who the hell are you to comment on what is the proper price to sell to
your friends?

Next time you win a roll for Boots of Flowing Slime and a friend inquires
about them....don't forget to sell them for FREE....they didn't cost you
anything right?   except maybe a few gems the night of the raid.

Give me a break.
