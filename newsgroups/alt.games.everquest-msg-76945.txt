I have all expansions on my 1st account, then all but SoV on 2nd account but
flicker is on either one.  My 2nd computer is only a Pentium 150 with 80 MB
Ram and ATI Xpert 128 Video card.  I know this cpu is slow but it has worked
in the past and I use it for buffing myself and transportation, transfer,
etc.
