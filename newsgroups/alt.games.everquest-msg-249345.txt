On one hand you have pointed out my error about the location of the original
posting by SOE.

On the other hand let me point out that you are also incorrect that Sony
doesn't communicate to the player base en mass by email.  Every time they
wish to sell me something I get an email.  So if they want to show they are
serious about fixing the problems, contact me directly.

They have the ability and should use it.
