The pen and paper version is based on EQ1. EQ2 is newer with better
graphics (higher system requirements) and a somewhat different world to
adventure in. The class structure in EQ2 and choices are different from
the choices in EQ1.

EQ Platinum costs $30 or so. It should include basic EQ through Discord
(I think). Omens of War and Dragons of Norrath are extra at $10 and $20
(30?) respectively. If you can visit the EQ store, you can find
information about the pricing. With a new expansion due later in the
year? pricing might change again.

Cost for EQ subscription is going up to about $15 a month. There is a
station account/subscription that is more like $21 that lets you play
other online MMORPGs that Sony has. The longer you commit to the
cheaper the monthly rate works out to.

EQ1 is playable with dialup but the update downloads can be a real
killer. When you first install EQ, you can expect hours of downloads
for the updates. Once you play EQ, you can expect occasional long
downloads. If you have cable or dsl it's a lot less of a problem. Some
people swear at dialup, but I had found that if data throughput is
reliable, then dialup works fine, assuming you get the minimum 28.8
connect speed (I would avoid a soft modem or winmodem, if at all
possible especially if your new computer is scrimping on the cpu
performance). If it isn't then you may swear and eventually shift to
broadband.

Have fun. Welcome to the game.
