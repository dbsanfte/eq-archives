Any fictional world needs a basis in our known reality. A master (skill
level 100) of any trade should be able to follow that trade and make a
living.

Two wrongs, don't make a right.
A good game is a simulation of some "real" world. all real worlds have
to have a workable "economic" system. - e.g. reasonable return on
labour.

Every co-ordinate/cartographics system that I know of uses x,y,z, not
y,x,z. I'm not too worried about +/- in the co-ords, althought most
cartographic systems use offsets to have all coordinates positives.

Major examples are the lack of consistent direction of travel. E.g. OoT
is traversed in an easterly direction, but you are travelling west on
the map of Norrath.
