Still haven't seen this shut down.  Mobs range from sub 25 to sub 40, with
a level 49 undead dragon spawning every half hour or so, and a boss mob
thats at least high 50s.  Killing the boss mob did -not- end the event.

There is some interesting loot off the random mobs, but most of the good
stuff is dropping off of named stuff.  You'll know the difference because
the names are the only ones with capitals.

I forget which named drop what, other than that most of the priest class
drops are off "The Wretched Mare" Names spawn every ten minutes
or so in the heavy killing environment; you just have to keep killing the
little stuff to get em to pop.

Respawn on EK is under three hours, as I saw it ended at 5 pm my time,
and it was on again by 7:29.

A fair number of items dropping, seem to drop off any mob regardless
of level, relatively rarely, and if you didn't kill the mob, you'll probably
have at least one other person trying to loot the same mob you are competing
for that drop.

Oddly I saw a couple no rent items, warrior only sword and shield with
crappy stats.

There's also one item which isn't no drop, an Int book I think.

Most of the loot here is different from the RM loot, although I did see
the same priest earring drop as there.

Haven't seen this one yet, but reports say it lasts under an hour, apparantly
the
"don't kill the overlord" thing just doesn't work in that area.

Preacher or snake.  I saw it ended when someone trained the snake over to
the EFP line, apparantly the newbie guards near the inn were perfectly capable
of killing the snake.

Items are dropping off any mob, but rarely.  Again they seem to be class
specific,
and you'll have a hard time looting one if you didn't kill the mob, as there
are
hoards of people here trying to do the same thing.

One in QH as well, the guards and merchants are still up, but all the normal
targets have been replaced by skeletal soldiers of one kind or another.
Highest
level mobs I could find were Warbone Skeletons,  blue to me at 26.  Best
drops I could find were bronze weapons.  Tovak was still up, so apparantly
he's not on the "to be replaced" list.
