If you want to call yourself any of the names you mention, you will get
added to lots of ignore lists. This is how it works. You give yourself a
offensive name, people will realise what sort of a player/person you are,
and you will be added to lots of ignore lists.
You give yourself an amusing name, people will compliment you (unless they
are po-faced and humorless about what is only a game in the end).
This is how it should work.
