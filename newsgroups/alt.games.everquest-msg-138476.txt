You are ressed with lungs full of air, so you've got the normal amount of
time to deal with the problem.  The problem is going to be mana.  Don't you
come back from res at 0 mana?  That probably won't leave time to loot fish
scales off your corpse and med back enough mana to cast the spell.

The usual ways to deal with the problem are to do one (or more) of the
following:

1. Have an EB caster casting EB on people as soon as the Cleric resses them.

2. Have a Magician summon whatever it is that they can summon that casts EB,
and someone hands one of those to each newly ressed person.

3. Have someone hand the newly ressed person an EB potion.

4. Everyone who is going to die and does not have an EB item makes sure that
they have some EB potions or some of those magician thingies on their
corpse, and the first thing they do on getting ressed is loot 'em and use
'em.
