Yes. And just for future reference, a couple quick rules of thumb that
will make your life easier:

Never leave in a whole, huge, long post just to add one or two lines at
the bottom. Feel free to <snip> (as I did above) the portions that don't
really pertain to the key point you are replying to, and only leave in a
short, pertinent piece of the message. Then add on your comments,
questions, etc. below. 

Optionally, if there is a long post where you have several points you
want to address, feel free to "interlace" your comments, leaving in
portions of their text, followed by yours, then more of theirs, your
answer, etc. etc. 

Try to stay on the topic of the newsgroup, but don't be afraid to throw
in the random bit of humor to amuse people, etc. However, if you are
starting a thread that's off topic, or taking one in that direction, it
helps to mark the subject line "OT". For example "OT: A good heroic
fantasy book I just read."

Flaming Verant Interactive or Sony Online Entertainment here, while
certainly not prohibited, will generally get you flamed in return in
many cases. Also, be aware that we have no conclusive proof that anybody
from VI reads this newsgroup except Brad, and he doesn't work there
anymore, so airing your complaints to them is probably best done on the
Sony Developer's Boards.

As to your spelling, punctuation, grammer, etc. hey.... just keep
typing. It will improve.
