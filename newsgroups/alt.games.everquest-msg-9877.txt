heh, this discussion is cracking me up, thanks.  See you need to stop
thinking like a civilized human being living on Earth and think more
like a Barbarian in Norrath.  They have respect for the wolves qualities
of supporting the pack  and mercilessly attacking their prey, not for
the wolves as beings.  As beings they are two things, a source of
supplies, meat and fur, and a danger to the young.  If you see the guard
killing a wolf its not for supplies, but to protect the young of the
clan. (though there may be an all your base connection working here <G> 
For great justice!! and all that <BG>)  So to the Barbarian there is no
conflict here, the individual wolf is no more than an animal to them,
its the conceptual wolf they revere.

Now if you really want to explore this further.... Barbarians tend to
refer to their young as "cubs" yet one of the first things young
barbarians are taught to hunt are polar bear "cubs".  What do you make
of that one? hehe
