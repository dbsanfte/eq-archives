I Killed a Silver griffin in NK. I was playin' my 52nd lvl Enchanter. Was
Blue to me, but a fairly easy kill, I had no trouble killing it. It dropped
a No drop Feather, but I can't find what its used for? Its mentioned in
Allakhazam's web site http://everquest.allakhazam.com/  and it says for a
tunic, but no one knows what final prize is, or where it starts, if anyone
has any info on this item, please help me, I also need to know if it is a
druid, or ranger tunic ( per chance ) is fianal item No drop too? or can it
be MQed? If its no drop or can't be MQed I'll have to just destroy it I
suppose..
