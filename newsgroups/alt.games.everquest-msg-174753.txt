The way I saw it....  your clerics on a cheal rotation (necessary for ixi at
your level) are in ADDITION to the healers keeping each group alive.

Put your cheal rotation clerics in a group and forget about them.. they are
most likely going to be too busy to heal anybody else, so then plan on a
healer for each melee group (druid or shaman is fine, the only damage they
will be taking is from AE's)
