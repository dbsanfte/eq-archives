Nope - FT 1 is 1 mana per tick.  Max is 15, and the cheapest you can 
buy is the earring of the solstice (you can buy the components and quest it
at any level for about 5k)

FTx = x mana per tick (capped at 15)
Standing regen at 65 is 3 per tick
Meditation at max skill is 20 per tick

Mental Clarity (AA) 1-3 = 1-3 mana per tick

Breeze is 2 per tick
Clarity is 4per tick at 29 to 9 per tick at 65
Clarity 2 is 11 per tick
KEI is 14 per tick
VoQ is 18 per tick

Spiritual Light is 3 per tick
Spiritual Radiance is 5 per tick
Spiritual Purity is 7 per tick
Spiritual Dominion is 9 per tick

Cassindra's Chant of Clarity is 2 per *pulse*
Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity is 5 (at 32) to 7 (at 48) per *pulse*

Cantata of Soothing is 5 per tick
Cantata of Replenishment is 12 (at 55) to 14 (at 65) per tick
Chorus of Replenishment is 12 (at 55) to 14 (at 65) per tick *ae*
Chorus of Marr is 20 (at 64) to 21 (at 65) per tick *ae*

Protection of the Cabbage/Glade 6 per tick
Protection/Blessing of the Nine 8 per tick

Koadic's Heightened Focus is 5 (on chest items from VT)

Sedulous Subversion 150 mana to target for 400 mana from Necro

Mystical Transvergence (from mage summoned T-rods) 360 mana for 450 hp,
can be used once every 5 minutes.

These are all the mana regens that can be given to other people (that I can 
think of, it doesn't include self only buffs

As to stacking - you can have 1 spell from the breeze line, 1 from
the spiritual line, 1 from the cantata/chorus line and 1 from the 
druid protection line, and the robe effect.  An unlimited number of 
necros can "twitch" someone, You can have 5 bards in a group singing their 
pulsed Cassindra's (they stack) and they can pulse it as fast as they can 
cycle the song (it gives mana on the pulse, just like twitch and rods).  
They can also use Amplification (and I think their epic) to boost the mana 
from it. The maximum mana regen a non mage/necro/shaman can get is
(not including necros twitching and amplified bard song)

Meditation = 20
Base = 3
FT15 = 15
Mental Clarity = 3
VoQ = 18
Spiritual Dominion = 9
BoT9 = 8
Chorus of Marr = 21
Koadic's Heightened Focus = 5
Mod Rod every 5 min = 7

total = 109.

So, in conclusion, the percentage gain from a FT1 item is small, and
even FT15 only provides a small boost to a raid buffed player's regen.
But, droppable FT is rare enough, and people who can't get the higher
level raid targets plentiful enough that they command a hefty premium.
