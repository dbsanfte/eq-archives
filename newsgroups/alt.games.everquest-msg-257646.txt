By removing a variable from the game. Everything becomes that much
more predictable.

It does reduce the amount of freedom you have to play. Oh my god,
they're engaged with a mob! They might as well be on another planet
for all the impact the people (you know, the first m in mmorpg) around
them can have.

I call the entire playerbase getting to the point of gutlessness, not
any individual people, and its because people don't want to have to
deal with anything anymore.

seems what you actually want is NWN.

I was never fond of the word "carebear" but if anything deserves that
moniker, so far its EQ2.
