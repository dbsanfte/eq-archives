Man, is this thread depressing... I went through my opinions a couple
hours ago as I posted to my other newsgroup but I guess I'm going to
dig them up again now.

Adam, if I were you I'd take *yesterday* as a lesson no one will
forget. There is no way an entire country could condone something on
this scale, and I've heard reports to the effect that the people
cheering the actions don't really understand the scale of it (One
happy palestinian, upon being told that 50 000 people worked in the
WTC, immediately turned serious) and no matter how thoughtless and
insensitive it is to cheer a strike against Satan(USA) they don't
deserved to be nuked to oblivion.

As mentioned other places in the thread, a civilian who harbors
terrorists isn't a civilian, but a terrorist. Did you guys championing
that sentence read it when you want to make a counterstrike that kills
even more civilians? By definition, the people you and we all are
after are NOT the civilians. (If it's still unclear, the civilians are
the ones who are not helping the terrorists...)

I'm all for executing the people who planned and organized this; as
far as I'm concerned the hijackers should spend their time in paradise
with seventy virgin kobras wrapped around them. I'd be happy if
Taliban or <insert radical terrorist organization here> got wiped out.
I would not be happy if Afghanistan, Palestine or Saudi Arabia got
wiped out. Vengeance is called for, but it has to be against the right
targets and ONLY the right targets, or it'll make a mockery of the
deaths of the thousands of innocents yesterday.

I talked with someone last night who had lost her best friend since
the age of 8. The poor thing had had a horrible day and was trying to
play some EQ to distract herself a bit, but couldn't stop crying long
enough. I got in touch with my friends in the Newark area through
email and they and their friends were all okay, but my heart goes out
to everyone who has lost someone in this :(

One of the main rules I live by is that people ARE stupid. However, I
love humanity and the goodness in most of us, and I guess it's because
of the fact that most of us ARE good people that the stupid cruelness
of shit like this still shocks me.

(bin Laden is an ass when he proclaims that fighting Americans is a
major tenet of their religion - the Koran never mentioned America.)

Some of the pictures from New York last night showed the city shrouded
in a dust cloud, with the water and the Statue of Liberty in clear air
in the foreground...

You warmongers might want to sit down and think about what that statue
was meant to represent. 

Don't perpretrate the insanity.
