How do you handle players who steal your kites?

Yesterday I was in Everfrost kiting mammoths and had no less than three
different people steal my kites.  If I make a mistake and start hitting a
MOB that someone is kiting, I immediately stop and apologize saying I wasn't
aware it was being kited.

These players would not stop after I repeatedly told them "It's mine! I'm
kiting it!"  One guy just said "No you weren't", after he took my kill.
