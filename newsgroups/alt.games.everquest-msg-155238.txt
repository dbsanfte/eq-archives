Pshaw.  

* The *instant* Nova spawned, some total stranger threw a bunch of
stuff in the trade window.  I hadn't even handed in my friggin guild
note yet, and I had Taellaar sitting in a safe spot nearby with two
bags of twink equipment waiting for him.

* I had a low level druid for awhile.  I deleted her because some high
level druid cast a couple buffs on her then pestered her whenever she
came on, wanting to talk all the time, and getting WAY too friendly,
and *constantly* dropping in 'in person' to buff her some more or just
stand around watching her fight large rats.  Ack, creepy.

* Nova got a DMF from a necro once who started hitting on her.  Told
him "hey no offense but I don't swing that way" to which he replied
with a bunch of rather personal questions, but none really offensive
(ie - "do you think it's weird that girls sleep with guys"), with a
disclaimer that if I was unhappy with the questions he'd stop asking.
I admitted I wouldn't mind if they stayed clean and answered.  He had
an annoying habit of calling me "sweetie" and the like which annoyed
the fuck out of me (really - try waitressing all day and coming home
to hear that kind of talk even *more* when you're *not* getting paid
to), but stupidly, I didn't tell him to back off.  And each time we
talked he'd ask me another couple of questions - on the 'weird
question, but not really offensive' level.  Then one day out of
nowhere, he asks me, don't I like things inside of me?  "Pardon?" is
all I can get out.  He clarifies.  Sure I'm a lesbian, but does that
mean I don't ever want like, phallic stuff inside of me.  /ignore

* About a week after *that* little debacle, I was farming batwings in
Freeport when some chanter came up and bought them all off Fizzle a
moment before I could make room for them.  I turned around and let him
know that he could buy them in the casters guild then swore to myself
and ran off to farm them the boring way.  Awhile later I get a tell
from said chanter asking if I'm trying to make money.  ?? I'm level
25, twinked very nicely - yeah sure.  I'm saving all the rat whiskers
I get :p  I said "no".  Short, but not rude.  I just didn't feel like
getting into a conversation.  A) because I'd had a bad day at work and
was just there to tradeskill.  B) because of stuff like the above.  I
prefer getting to know someone in group or guild or some other public
form of chat first before letting them move into private tells.  A
little while later he approaches and throws some batwings into the
trade window.  I say "no thanks" and hit cancel.  Keep doing what I'm
doing.  LD slaps me a few minutes later, and just as I'm about to go I
get "that'll teach me to be nice."  I get back online and send him a
tell asking what the hell that was supposed to mean and he mutters
something about having been joking.  I don't reply (mainly because all
I could think to reply was "you have a weird sense of humor") and a
little later I get *another* comment about how it doesn't pay to be
nice.  I tell him that I don't take what I don't need and I don't
appreciate strangers thinking I owe them something for 17 batwings
("18" - yes, they actually corrected me on the number :p).  Yet
another apology from his end and... well, to make an already long
story short(er), I continued to get pestered by this guy about what a
jerk I was for not taking the batwings even after I'd gone through 8
stacks of fish roll attempts, and run from Freeport to North Karana.
I gave up on keeping it short and simple and told him it was because
of people like him I didn't accept help from strangers - that guys had
this stupid habit of expecting me to be their own little flirt-whore
because I took something from them, and therefore I'd get my own stuff
thanks, and I was putting him on ignore.  5 minute ignore, take him
off to see if he has shut up yet, and about 20 minutes later I get a
tell saying "I shudder to think of the kind of people you date in real
life to get such a twisted outlook on guys."  /ignore.  And a day
later I get a guildie pestering me to talk to them.  Turns out it was
one of my own guildies on an alt that put me through that shit. >:p
Unfortunately somewhere along the line logging got turned to FALSE so,
I didn't do anything about it.

What really pisses me off is that I know a lot of good guys.  I have a
really REALLY good friend in guild that I hang out with all the time,
and he makes jokes about us getting *married*, but he doesn't ever
take the joking into the personal realm, nor does he assume that I'm
there to giggle and make cute little insinuations to make him feel all
man-like.  I hung out with Martin and he was a lot of fun.  And I *do*
flirt.  But I don't do it with strangers, and I don't do it because
somebody gave me something - I do it because I trust whoever I'm with
to keep it on a fun basis.  Guys are fun, and I've got more guy
friends online and IRL than girl friends, but dammit, some of them
really need something hot and sharp jammed up a very uncomfortable
place to distract them from the fact that there are girls out there
who don't use EQ as a fucking cyber room.  And I am never, EVER going
to make another female character.
