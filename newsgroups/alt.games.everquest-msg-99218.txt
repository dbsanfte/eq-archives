A damn good reason why a permanent (not pc made) global auction channel would
be a bloody good idea e.g

/auction  - for zone ( i'm here and i want to sell here) + low lvl stuff 
(batwings,bone chips etc)

/globalauction - i want to sell - will travel.

Leaving it to players is ripe for abuse e.g log on a mule, enter channel and
wait, when you become moderator you change the password to something nobody
willl get and boot everyone from channel.
Even if other players start up new channels to replace it it's only going to be
a matter of time till said griefer screws that up to.

I say take something this useful out of players hands totally.
