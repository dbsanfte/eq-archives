You may have missed my point. I also think it is great that people farm 
this stuff and sell it. I just think it is ridiculous for it to be sold 
for upwards of 30pp each. Now, before anyone replies, with the intent of 
explaining capitalism and the whole "what the market will bear" theory, 
let me just say that there is no need. I am perfectly familiar and 
completely agree with the concept. I get that. My point is that a market 
that will regularly bear 30pp for a freaking leather padding has got to 
be a bad indicator for that economy.
