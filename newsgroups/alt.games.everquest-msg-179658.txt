That seems like an odd place to do it. This isn't the year 2000
anymore, those dwarves aren't really heavily camped. If they were,
someone must have been *really* bored.

I used my charm that doesn't give aggro one night in oasis years ago
to charm the crocs, then gave em sow and blades, then let them go. Of
course I was also buffing the poor lowbies fighting those demonic
crocs, so I wasn't *all* evil.
