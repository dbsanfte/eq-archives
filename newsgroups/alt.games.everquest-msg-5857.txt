The only quest they are good for is to use a sewing kit to sew 4 patches
of gnoll fur into a 'gnoll fur patch', then 4 gnoll fur patches into a
gnoll fur quarter, then 4 gnoll fur quarters into a patched gnoll fur
bundle, a cloak which is I believe, AC4, +5 SV cold. That's right, you
need at least 64 patches of gnoll fur. You either wear that or you can
turn it in somewhere in Halas for a fang of the wolf, a rather crappy,
but magic, barbarian-only piercing weapon. It may be rogue-only too, I'm
not sure.

So for 64 patches you get 1 faction hit. I'd say no, gnoll fur isn't
good for faction, just for skilling up your tailoring on.

Pretty much the case, but beware - there are a corrupt faction of guards
who are in the pockets of the bloodsabres and most quests that give you
a hit against the bloodsabres (the necros/shadowknights in the sewers)
will also give you a hit against the corrupt guards. These guards are
probably dubious to you at the moment, and they are above ground. You
may very well slip into KOS with half the guards in Qeynos but not the
other half. There seem to be a few near the docks on corrupt faction...

If handing in gnoll teeth to Captain Tillin for faction, take the
moonstones he gives you and hand them in to McNeal Jocub in fishes ale -
I believe this gives you faction hits on both sides of the fence for the
corrupt guards, so they should even out.
