Yesterday, I was just minding my own business, hunting the Tesch Mas Gnolls
that pop on the hill North of Splitpaw. As I was sitting there waiting, I
saw a beautiful white Pegasus float by, majestic and regal as could be. So I
killed it. And, as luck would have it, the Pegasus Feather Cloak dropped!
This is a badass little item, though I felt bad after learning that it was
Ultro-Rare, and a part of the mage epic, but hey - ignorance is bliss, and I
can float now! Mountainous regions, here I come!
