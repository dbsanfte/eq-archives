While this is a workable way to keep track of buffs, I find
it generally more efficient to use the "tell me when you need
another" method, if the people in my group are capable of
paying a little attention to their own protection.

Here's how it works:  I buff myself on logging in, and keep
those buffs up always. When I join up with someone, I buff
them, not buffing myself.  We add someone, I buff them.
Repeat as needed.

Now, my buffs fade out... but I just reapply them, hardly costs
any mana.  Later my first buddies go out, he tells me, I put
em back up, no big deal.

Instead of a FM to 20M event, buffing takes less than a bub
of mana each time it comes up, and therefore doesn't often
require so much as a pause in the action.

I have been known to put Resolution on a self timer, since
its cheap and easy to replace... everyone gets it!  But theres
no way I can afford to drop Shield of Words on half the
party, nor Naltron on everyone, and not need some actual
down time.

SOW being a "got to have it" spell makes sense to run
on a timer, particularly at higher levels where it becomes
dirt cheap.  On the other hand, there's no way I'd die
because I let my SOW run out and it didn't get recast...
on the rare occaision where there's a SOWer in my
party and I can't get one in fairly short order, then suddenly
the group is without a cleric.

SOW is life... res is what I do when SOW runs out at
the wrong time.
