Nope, if you can't get two hands around it, it just doesn't say "berserk!"

This is particularly irritating when it comes to trinkets like that 
knife that procs bandages, or the fact that I can't learn Bash so my 
racial Slam ability is wasted.

I have a 20/30 2hp at the moment, I'm thinking there must be -something- 
crappier... I didn't really look in the bazaar for crappy, wish that 
Ratio was something you could search by.
