Um.. no. Personally, I like what they're doing. The fact of the matter
is this.. MMORPG's are a bit of a different beast then other games
because their lifespan tends to be quite a bit longer. I'm sure the
graphics of Everquest were great.. 5 years ago... but the hardware was
a pale comparison to what there is now. So if you are making EQ2.. you
set it up for the absolute bleeding edge of technology. After all, the
super-puper features can always be turned off for those with 'lesser'
video cards. And as you upgrade your video card at your own leisure,
which you will, more and more things get turned on and you get a whole
'new' view of the game world each time you do.
