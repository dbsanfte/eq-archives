which weap?  kk that nullifies a bit of what I said heh

SS is a velk of sorts for me now, with a bit more mob variation.  If you
pick the mobs in the right order, runners aren't so bad (I try to hold off
from using mend for as long as possible, when im real hurt they don't try
and run till its too late)

If your at the first gate (after the 2 wurms), what i call the 'ss'... if
you open the gate and kill the first mob on your right (when he tries to run
he warps back to the gate each time), then the small hungry cube.. you can
single pull the other 3 wyverns, then pull the wurm into the middle of that
room (the wurms an ass for killing before he runs)

I know what you mean.. but even with a maxed skill in ID at level 60, its
flakey to say the least.. not something I can expect to even work 50% of the
time I try it, to make it a viable constant soloing tool.

I don't see a spell book for our ports !!
