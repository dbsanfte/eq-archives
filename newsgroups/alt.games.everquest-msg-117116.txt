Even in Wolf form, if someone asks for SoW, I'll usually mem it and
cast it.  It's not a big deal.  However someone demanding that, or any
buff, usually gets the cold shoulder.  If I'm in the middle of killing
a griff or something, they usually get told off.  Sorry, that's just
stupid.  Anyone who talk to me in kewldewd speech gets ignored.

Any one who casts a free buff on me, will always get buffs, including
SoW in return.  Often, I'll port lowbies to other zones and buff them.
If you're on my ignore list, neither buffs or ports shall you recieve.

It's just good politics.  You never know whether the lowbie or newbie
is an alt of a higher level char who just might be someone who
remembers those who are helpful, too.
