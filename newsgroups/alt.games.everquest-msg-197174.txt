Am I the only one who started (non-PL but twinked) in PC at level 4?
4 through 20 can be done insanely quickly.  Start at 3 at the
Shadeweavers Thicket zone line, since you have cleric to PL.  I zoomed
through the lower levels fighting yellows and whites.  With cleric
buffs (HB, shield of words, Pinzarn) plus tiny heals, and root for
crowd control,  it should be trivial.  Throw in no-damage stuns (real
cheap to cast) as well.  I'm not sure how exp works on Mark of
Retribution though ==> who gets credit for the damage, that is.

Note that Kurns IS great exp and very easy as dungeons go, but I doubt
that the exp is as good as in PC at the levels you list.

I agree that PC IS great, but it's great at a much much earlier level
than most people actually realize.  I literally dinged 5 then 6, no
more than 15 minutes later with my soloing pally there.  And he was
only mildly twinked....  People were sending me tells asking me how I
could possibly survive there.  I told them that it was the best kept
secret in the game.  Unfortunately the very next day, the secret was
out, and what used to be an almost completely empty part of the zone
became nearly as crowded as the 15-20ish level parts (I hope it wasn't
my fault hehe)..
