I always wondered why verant don't put a "win game" button on the login
screen. When you press it it debits your credit card ï¿½100 and transfers
your character to a special server. Call it a "powergamers" server or
something
to make the twinks thing they are special and it automatically makes you
level 60 and gives you lots of stuff.

Then everyone would be happy.
