In a group, it's pretty easy to see if your pet is in the top 2 levels,
wait for a lull, reclaim/resummon.  It's hardly tedious.  I just don't
like having a level 41 pet trying to hit level 54 Rock Golems in the hole.
I see the max hits of 50, I reclaim, resummon, BO3.  Boom, I'm only down
about 150 mana.  Go a couple of kills, keep an eye on his hits, 54 and up,
I won't resummon.
