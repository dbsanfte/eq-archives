My characters are on Cazic Thule, and we were the first to go through a 
merge.  I logged my account for the first time in ages immediately after the 
merge just to see how things had been affected (and to get a little use out 
of the All Access Pass), and have been quite pleased to find that there are 
opportunities for all of my characters to see the light of day.

One afternoon I decided to run my 18 necro across Everfrost to hunt the top 
of Perma, and noticed something I hadn't seen in over a year.  The entire 
zone was being utilized.  There were groups in the newbie area, a group on 
Bandl's ledge hunting calfs, Redwind was beign picked on, and there was a 
waiting list at IGs ... just like the old days.

I've since abandoned EQ2 and progressed my Ogre SK from 34 to 36, and he's 
happily entrenched in Lower Guk.

The only thing that I have noticed is that prices in the bazaar are all over 
the place.  Apparently the economy on Brell was as fubar as CT's, and 
combining the two has really caused chaos.  Also, there's a discrepancy in 
the usage of acronyms that's causing a bit of trouble for folks trying to 
assemble pick-up groups/raids.

But, by and large, the merge has made the low-mid to upper-end game playable 
again, at least on Cazic Thule.
