Well, by taking on, I mean actually killing the mobs, not giving myself 
extra time to run away.  It's very rare that I cannot just run away from 
an encounter that looks iffy, without a pet to keep the mob busy.  It's 
pretty rare that I cannot harvest a node with a hostile mob near it, the 
distance you can harvest at allows you to harvest without aggroing, and 
you can see which direction the mob will move, as it almost always moves 
the direction it is facing while standing still.
