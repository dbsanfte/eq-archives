How about a Forage category?  I realize that on the surface it seems so
trivial; however, to NEVER buy any food/water, BE a source of sustenance for
others easy, it remain NON-summoned and add the fact that some quests
REQUIRE you to find a forager to help you complete your quest...it does add
up.

I also realize that it is a racial ability too; however, as you have already
listed that some classes can get certain category-mentions solely because
there is a racial factor, I think this would be doable.  For instance,
woodelves can't be every class so for the classes that they can be give them
a 1 if they can actually be that class.

Thoughts?
