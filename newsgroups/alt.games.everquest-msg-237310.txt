That sounds closer at least.  I am pretty sure VS is a 3 day timer, with 
VSR spawning abou 24 hours after he is killed.  As I recall, you can get 
2 VSR spawns between VS spawns, and, if VS spawns while VSR is up, VSR 
despawns.  We used to have a VS rotation on EMarr, and my guild was in 
the rotation, so I am reasonably certain of the 3 day timer.
