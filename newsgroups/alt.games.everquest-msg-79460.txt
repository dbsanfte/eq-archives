Has nothing to do with the subject at hand.. however.  It should be noted to
not ever piss off the druid as well.. regardless if there is a Cleric in the
group or not.  In fact (and I have read the purpose or true intent of this
post from T. Rose confession post) if this had happened to me, I might just
have had to port everyone in the group to say.. East Commons, then sort them
out (those idiots in the group, from those considerate and intellegent ones)
and port them all back to DL's.  Oh yes.  Please do piss off the Druid.  We
MIGHT just be so inclined to SHOW you how much or atleast WHEN we like to be
"port whore."  ;p

This post isnt directed at you TwoHead, just the only post to really sprout
this new topic off of.. ;)
