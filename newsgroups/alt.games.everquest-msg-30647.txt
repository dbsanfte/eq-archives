At least for a Wizard in the Greater Faydark.

I have been at level 7 FOREVER and it is so annoying...

It's when your spells start to loose their effect (just before you get new
ones) Orc Hill gives you very little exp, and is STILL dangerous if you get
ganged up on, and CB is EXTREMELY dangerous...I died there seven or eight
times in one night, and with a group at that!

Speaking of which, has anyone else walked into a room, and been surprised to
fine about 12-20 Orc Legionaires in the room? Killed my group real quick.
Good thing the enchanter had invis, or my corpse would have been lost until
some benevolent high level was able to pick it up...

So, any tips for a level 7 high elf wizard to get to level 8? I'm dying
here!
