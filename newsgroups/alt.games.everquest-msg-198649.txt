I wish this as much as you, but lets get real. Unless they force a
name on EVERYONE (ie - give you a name at creation time), they will
NEVER be able to control this (and forcing a name on people will suck
- and wont ever happen).

Ever read thier naming conventions for SWG? They say... "You will not
see LuukSkywalker777 running around." Well... Ive seen a Luukee
Skyywalker already in beta(something close to that - not sure of the
exact number of U's and Y's). If you give people the ability to choose
thier names, they will find a way to create something that violates
the policy. Its virtual programming impossibility to enforce a strict
naming convention. Code cant be as creative as the human mind.

It would require a team of name natzis, that they wont want to pay to
enforce.

Theres so much debate on this subject and everyone has a heated
opinion. Purists (like it sounds like yourself, and me) HATE seeing
non-roleplay like names (I see more names on my EQ server that violate
the "rules" than adhere to it), others dont see a problem with it. The
type that really irk me are the sentence type names (like... "Stabsu
Indaback"). But not everyone sees this as a problem, arguing that they
pay thier $15 a month (or whatever currency they use) and should be
able to have fun thier way. A valid point. Unfortunatly, our mindset
seems to be the minority, and of course its bad business to alienate a
large portion of your customers.

Perhaps the answer is in having a special roleplay server where they
can pay one guy to hawk over the names and the other servers allow a
more lenient policy. Im not sure if SWG is planning this or not.
Seeing how EQ has this, its a safe bet to think EQ2 will have
something similar.
