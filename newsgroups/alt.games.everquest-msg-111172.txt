I had heard that the Yeti drop it in DL.  I had very little trouble finding
it myself, go to Everfrost, head to the Permafrost zone area, politely ask
the people that are killing the giants if they will sell you their Essence
drops.  I got a fair number that way, many of them free when I told them
what it was for.  I also went into Permafrost, and offered to buy Ice Goblin
Bloods, with the same result, got many free, bought some, buffed some people
in exchange for some.
