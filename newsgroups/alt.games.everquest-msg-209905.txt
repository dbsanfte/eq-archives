There is a price to be paid here the Ogre gets a stiff xp penalty as
do Trolls and Iksar IIRC. Also unless you keep a supply of shrink
potions there are places Ogres just dont fit well. Not huge problems
but still enough to push me to compromise with humans. Also best tank
changes according whats expected, holding agro SK, taking a beating
War, survivability Pally. The only plate class that pulls better agro
than an SK is a foolish cleric )
