First off, why? Just because you know the other area better? Cabilis has a 
very decent and fast exp newbie area (Pit & Kurns) and later LOIO etc,
all within Cabilis, which is the *only* place in the whole game, where
you aren't killed on sight (well, nearly).

To answer you: What does newbie mean? To cross warslik, get a map from
EQ atlas, rund down to giant fort, follow the small creek around it
(stay off the fort walls! There are giants patrolling outside of it)
and take the path on the other side westwards to the OT zone. In OT, safest
is to run straight north after you zoned in, then follow the beach
westwards to the dock. Stay off the dock, enter water outside od ir, swim
around dock wall to the pier inside, stay off pier. Wait for the
boat to come, mount board by one of its slanted (!) barrels. This
bring syou to timorous deep. There, avoid the ogres, get off the boat,
swim to beach and go past the huts, following the rock on the left (west).
That bring syou to a little beach on the westside of the islang between
two rocky areas and a small little rock in the midle. There, wait for the
barrel barge to oasis.

Dangers: Warslik is a very, very dense forest full of hills and valleys,
you can't see a damn. Considering you're immediatly dead when you run into
anything at newbie (< 15-20) levels, this is a very dangerous thing
to do. Sow and invis help, though, if you see a shaman of high enough
level. The overtehre is *relatively* safe to cross as indicated, the
dock is perfectly safe if you stay off it and just swim in water. Timorous
is safe if you avoid ogres (some hide behind rocks). If you meet any, you
are dead, no zones to run.

I'd say stay in Cabilis/Kunark and try to use its advantages. Field
of bone and Kurns are (in my opinion) far far far better than Oasis/NRo
etc. Less people, more or less always able to group, high density
spawn of mobs, easy to pull, nearby city whatever. I really don't
see the point leaving it for levelling as long as you don't have any
other reason (getting bored might be one). Oasis is overcamped,
NRo an annoying landscape, where you have to run after mobs and
can run into those (censored) madmen etc .. nah .. yuck.
Ah, got carried away :)
