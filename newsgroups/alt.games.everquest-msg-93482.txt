Why is these more bothersome than most? Lately, i get someone who either
stumbles across me or does a who after a raid and finds me.

Never a hi, never a how are you, never a wow you have some awesome stuff.
Just buf me plz

I feel like a vending maching sometimes. (now i know how an enchanter feels)
