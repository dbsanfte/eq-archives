I tried learning languages today in the group while wiating for pops
in HHK.  Not one skill increase for me in Troll, and while I was
trying to teach Dark Elf, apparently I kept switching back and forth
from Common to DE.  I chose it in the damn menu command and all, in
fact selected it several times over at one point just to make sure,
and I'd do the lines a few times, then bang, back to common.  Very
frustrating, and I don't know why it was just me.
