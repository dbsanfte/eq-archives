I didn't notice the "self-healing" bug.  My guild ported in to Vex Thal,
killed a blob, and ported out right away.  I picked up a nice neck piece
that conveys a 20 percent mana savings on buffs, which was good.

When we went to Ssra to do Emp, the troubles began.  Twice we had masses of
people got teleported to their bind points.  We had people and corpses
warping all over the place.  Yet, despite all that, we moved in and took
down Emp without any problems.  Normally we then move on to clear out the
rest of Ssra, but we decided not to because of all the problems.

So there were still some rewards for playing last night.  And, despite the
inconvenience and headaches it causes, experiencing this kind of stuff
first-hand was fun for me.  =)  "Er, I don't even have Gate memmed, how'd I
