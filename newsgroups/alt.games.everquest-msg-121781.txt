Very true words!  I took my 52 (at the time) enchanter on an 8-group guild
raid to CoM for epic pieces.  Guess what?  I was the only chanter there.
Had it not been for a DE necro doing *mana-battery duty* (and a back up  DE
SK helping him) there is no way I would have been able to do a quarter of
the stuff I had to do that night, bless both their wonderful dark hearts,
even with the shaman's taking up the slack on hasting and slowing! ;-)  With
only two deaths and six epic pieces gotten, I'd say it was an excellent
night...and I know it was fun, if frantic.

No, Necros aren't clerics.  They're more versatile. Because of that, you'll
be asked to perform many different tasks in different groups.  They can
heal, and there are times that is important (although I'd have been pushing
getting another healer when a spot came available...and pushing hard!).
Just as there are times bringing mana to people who need it badly is an
extremely important role.  If you don't believe me, ask a cleric, or any
healer, who doesn't have the mana to heal you when the mobs keep coming.  Or
a (grateful) chanter without mana to stop those same mobs in their tracks.
When you get tired of it though, as Jazz said, there's always the option of
soloing.
