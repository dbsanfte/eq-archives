I hope I'm not the only one that feels this way, and also hope that thru 
you, my fellow readers, that I can come up with a way to vent my feelings to 
Sony.

Is it just me, or is anyone else outraged that they have decided to up the 
fee to $29.95/month?  I only play one game in the stable... that's EQ... 
I've never even checked out any of the rest of them, and have no desire to 
play Vanguard...

Yet, it seems that I need to help support those that might wish to. Is it 
unreasonable to think that Sony could structure their subscription rates on 
a tier type basis, so that those that only play one game can pay for one 
game?

Thanx for letting me vent a little... and for any ideas that you might have.
