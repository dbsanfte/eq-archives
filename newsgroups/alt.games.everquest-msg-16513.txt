The korean thing was a HUGE problem in diablo 2.
I'm not at all racist.
Diablo 2 got out of hand with People from eastern countries clogging up the
american servers. There is no excuse for this when they have their own
dedicated server in their respective countries.
It caused lag and hassle.
If EQ ever allows Different languages on the same server it will be
horriffic.
Imagine Gfay or EC on a multi language server!!!!

Now we have to worry about Koreans flying over to the US and attempting to
beat our asses because we got so haked off with them spamming gibberish that
we PK'ed them.

My theory is that Eastern people are an alien race. How else do they have
the latest technology first? Why is their writing based on symbols and
completely different to the rest of the worlds? Why are there so many of
them? Their culture is heavily based on a heirachical system that might be
seen in an alien race (more so than ours).

Strange.
