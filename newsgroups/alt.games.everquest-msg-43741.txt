You need the right molds, Plate molds. The molds in Oggok are Plate Molds. Here are the molds locations i know off:
Small:
Kaladim, think its in the Everhot Forge shop, not 100% sure.

Medium:
Felwithe, at the girl on top floor in the smith store.
East Freeport (not many know that one, a guildie found it), on TOP floor of the Armor by Iksar shop)

Large:
Halas (cant remember store name, only been there 2 times, dont plan to ever get back to that bloody city, hate the Everfrost/Halas area. Only
been there to transfer for a friend, and later to get the barbarian i transferred stuff for to the freeport area, bought the Large molds for my
trolls FP armor at that time).

So if you wanna help your ogre friends, prepare for a LONG run, hope you can bind there and gate back if your attempt fail.
