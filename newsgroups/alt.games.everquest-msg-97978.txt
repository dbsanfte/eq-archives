The ability to damage (heavily) the opponent while keeping that opponent out
of range.
That is where casters have more power than Melee classes (mainly Warriors)
with their ability to solo.
The obvious retort is that Warriors are far more desirable in the end
game...but not everyone plays it, so not everyone sees that side.
Melee classes just realise how much damage the mobs start doing in
comparison to themselves as they get higher in levels.

Only thing I's say about the spell book is I agree with the RP side of it
(closing you eyes to  med, I believe that is what the spell book was meant
to simulate) but I also understand why it was the most hated part of the
game for casters.
I'd much rather they removed that than handed out more Spell Gems to
casters.
