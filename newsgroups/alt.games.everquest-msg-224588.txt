Yup its a marketing coup.

They're selling software that is unfinished and people clamour for it.

/wonders how long before SoE starts charging its staff for the 
priviledge of being part of such a prestigious high-profile project 
instead of paying them.

The current team would probably quit for better jobs, but SOE probably 
*could* snap up a glut of people willing to work for nothing, even less 
than nothing, provided they spin it right. **shudders**
