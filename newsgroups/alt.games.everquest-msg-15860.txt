Ack! _Tailoring_ is an exploit now?  Don't get me banned!

}LQ Bear-    Give away

Dayamn.  I guess I never appreciated the demand for Large Studded Leather 
armor.  Must be all those Troll druids...

Unless there's some other use for MQ bear I'm not seeing, I'd expect it to 
be cheaper than MQ cat or wolf, which actually makes studded leather 
the size of actual non-chain classes.  As well as whips.
