You can install the client on a second pc (so no need to copy the files),
but you cant use the same cd key to create a second account. If you want to
play 2 copes online at once, you need 2 accounts, so you have to buy a
second cd key. Having done that you can register the new account on either
machine (using the newly obtained cd key). The cd keys arnt stored on your
machine anywhere, so you can run either account from either machine, or even
run 2 acounts from the one machine.
