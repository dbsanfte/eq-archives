I've always enjoyed a little of each, even on characters that don't solo
well; my cleric literally got half his exp from 35 to 62 soloing, for
example.  But groups are a great way to do things you can't do solo, and
offer lots more tactical possibilities than soloing ever will (because
soloing you always have just the one class, never combinations of six out
of the what, 16 classes?)

Soloing lets me challenge myself just as much as I want, if I die its just
me, if I waste my time its just me, and the rewards; well they too are
just mine, if something drops I want, there's no NBG or rolling or points
system, its mine all mine.  Course its unlikely that anything will drop
soloing that I'll want, but thats another story.

Moreover, soloing lets me go slower than grouping.  I know that sound
crazy, but its the principle reason I soloed so much; I often have chores
and such to do during a day, so I can't sit at the terminal playing flat
out for hours on end, which any good group will have any good player
doing.  But if I can grab a mob and spend my whole mana or HP bar (or
both) killing him, or a short series of mobs to the same effect, then sit
somewhere safe to med back up, I can get a load of wash done, or the
dishwasher loaded, or go out and weld handles on a few swords or whatever,
come back FM and ready to go again. Anyone will tell you that thats a poor
way to gather exp, its better to pick a target you can do with minimal med
time and repeat ten times in the time it would take me to kill one hard
mob and med back to full for twice the exp (logically, 1/5th the exp of
ten easier mobs)... but since I have to do the sword making or whatever, I
see it as a good way to break up my day, killing 20 hard mobs and not
being at the keyboard for the 20 long meds.

That said, I think my favorite way to play is neither with a large group
nor soloing, but rather small group; a partner or two.  Usually with this
you can get a good mix of capabilities that will enable you to do most
anything (a large group can do it to higher level creatures, mind you) and
you get a lot more personal interaction with just a buddy or two, there's
usually more chatting and fun in a small group than a large one, I find.
Plus, partnered with a friend or two you are more likely to be able to go
do whatever you like, try new tactics, etc; finding 5 likeminded people is
a lot harder, and full groups tend to be more of a grind because of this.

Balancing all that out is that these days, massive boosts to full group
experience means that you will be getting a lot more experience in them
than you once did, for most classes, more than you will soloing; there's
the vastly increased group bonus -and- the bonus for killing mobs closer
to your level (or higher than it- in either case much easier to do lots of
with a full group) -and- the fact that POP zones are tough but have a much
higher ZEM than other zones around the high end of the game.
