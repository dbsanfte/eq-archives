Well, the hardest part is studying the quest enough to know if there's any
sub-quests you need to do, then get THOSE details.  Make a list of all the
zones involved in your quest and what level you should be when you attempt
to get a particular item.  It's a hell of a lot of work and hopefully
someone's already done it, but YOUR list is most likely to be easily
understood by you by the time you get it done. :)

When my high level druid was killing time in SolA I killed an elemental and
something dropped. When I asked in ooc what it was for, I was told it was
for the mage epic.
