We set out from Halas before dawn, south to Qeynos where we proceeded to
drink heavily.  Near noon we headed to the docks with our packs full of
more ale and wine for the trip which turned exciting when I fell
overboard as we left the docks and the boat suddenly shifted out from
under me.  (my version of that event, may not reflect the actual event) 
When we reached Erud we feasted upon peach and peacock and enjoyed their
fine spirits.  Together our hearty band of adventurers met the end of
the world with a song in our hearts and livers full of ale.  Aye now, 
that was indeed special and fun.
