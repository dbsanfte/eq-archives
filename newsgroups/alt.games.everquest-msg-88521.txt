/agree
We ran into the same problem. I maxed out my dorf and Dragon factions to
Ally long before Tiru, though she's on virtually every raid I do. Took
us a while to realize that in the Arena she had to pop up and stun every
giant with a low level stun before it died to get the faction hits. Pain
in the ass, since she's healing/buffing somebody on the hate list every
single fight. I think it's a bug, but I've seen nothing on the Dev
boards about it, though I've put in a /bug report.
