Actually priests probably solo *better* than anyone else
at that stage of the game.   No real melee damage but
they can nuke and heal themselves.  I solo'd a shaman
to 11 in under a day in Freeport, including orange carrion
hounds, ghostly orcs, and fallen soldiers.   He completed
his class quest at level 9 (started it at level 8) and had to
go kill ~60% of level 9 before he could don his shaman
gear...

10+ is still newbie range -- EVERYONE can solo well.
If *anyone* has problems, it's probably mages -- they
can't complete their heroic opportunities from the start
like priests.
