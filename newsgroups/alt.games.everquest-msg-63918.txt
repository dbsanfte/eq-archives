I apologize if this has been covered already. AT&T only just restored
my connection this morning, so I've been a little out of touch.

Some new things listed at Casters Realm...

- Teeth no longer needed for Velious ports. 

I have mixed feelings about this. From an ease-of-play perspective,
this is a good thing. But conceptually, I thought the idea of the
teeth was excellent. It was a sort of rite of passage that you had to
get to a location on foot before you could be ported there (and, it
made sense within the context of the game, too). I think that instead
of removing this requirement, it should have been made global. Of
course, we'd have needed a really decent keyring item then...

- Higher Mana returns for High Int/Wis. 

Define "High Int/Wis", pease :)  A good change, though, no matter
what.


- New Items in Game with Bonuses against monster types, or to
tradeskills. 

Another good change. All the rumors of the past that said "holding a
certain book while you tailored will improve your success rate" are
finally getting a real voice.


*Three* CDs for SoL?!?! Boggle!


New command "/facepick". Trolls should get a "/nosepick" command, too,
to go with the automatic "/assscratch" function.
