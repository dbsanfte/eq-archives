Well, normally I'd say it would be difficult to tell, but given his armor, I
doubt he has any masks, either.  He's probably just been spending time
building his skills and fighting, instead of doing research on websites and
usenet.  If he's as good as you suggest, though, then it's a good idea to
build him up a bit.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
