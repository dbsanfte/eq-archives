Scaled Mystics are the shaman faction.

To raise Iksar faction, you first need to kill a bunch of sarnaks,
goblins and outlaw Iksar (bandits, marauders, etc.) until you are
non-KOS to the Legion of Cabilis (Trooper guards).  However, you will
still be KOS to the Crusader guards.  To become non-KOS to Crusaders,
go to Trooper Mozo, one of the guards in Field of Bone by the
entrance, and hand him four bone chips at a time.
