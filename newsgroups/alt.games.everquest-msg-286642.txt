Yep, but places like Uqua and Time Phase 3 have trash which all enrages, 
and if those places are laggy just turning may not be enough.  For some 
reason ducking instantly disables attack at both the server and client 
end.  Turning has a delay and you don't want to eat 4 x 2k ripostes 
because of lag.

No exit to PoTime, need a porter or some other option.  The entrance 
area (PoTime A) has plenty of mobs you can talk to to find out about the 
lore, but nothing to kill.  All the action takes place in PoTime B.

Unlike a lot of zones in EverQuest, PoTime feels like a Game to me. 
It's designed to be game like, beat this encounter, move over here, beat 
that encounter.  There's no real sense to the zone other than being 
designed to beat encounters.

It doesn't feel like a fortress in which you must slowly move and beat 
increasingly hard guards, just a place with rooms designed to kill gods.

Still, despite that, it's one of the most fun places I've raided.  While 
I raided there a couple of years ago with a raid guild, we only broke 
into Time with our little raid alliance in January this year (did the 
complete and full flagging process for everyone in the alliance) and the 
raids are still a blast and a candy land of gear drops.
