You could be right, I thought it was steel warriors.  IIRC Steel
warriors is first faction raise you get when turning in the back pack in
the basement.  It's actually a decent quest for raising faction with
both good and bad.  turn in the pack, for positives with steel warriors,

on the end of the dock for Militia, coallition of illegal.
