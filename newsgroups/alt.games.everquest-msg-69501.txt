    Yeah, damn those players for going where other players are so they can
PLAY instead of LFG. Don't they know the game is supposed to be filled with
long, boring downtime travelling from place to place, looking for people to
group with?

>50s right now is Fungus Grove.

    High level zones are "faddish" - short-term people go if it has new
drops they want that can't be bought cheaply at EC. Long-term they go for
convenience and XP. I've seen more than a few Fungus Grovers come back to
Velk's this week, just because it's more convenient for them to hunt in
and/or they got the FG drops they were after.
