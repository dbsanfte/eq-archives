The problem with doing this, as a mage, is that its very hard to make any
real money doing so.  In reality, a set of mage summons is a good deal more
valuable than a KEI; drastically reducing mana costs and increasing damage
output and buff duration and speeding casting times, the items last till
the end of your current session, which can be a good deal longer than even
the most extended duration KEI; if you don't already have all the focus in
permanent form they can be a very economical way to bring your character up
to maximum capability.

Why so hard to make a buck on them, then?  Well for one thing, most people
are only vaguely aware of the items at all.  For another, people aren't all
that savvy to how much a 10% casting cost savings here and there adds up,
compared to just regenning mana faster; if you spend 10% less thats like
having a 10% larger mana pool and regenning mana 10% faster, both at the
same time.

Also, instead of having the names of regular focus effects, they generally
have more obscure focus names like Gallenite's Major Destruction, and
although the spells themselves now have a blurb that describes the effects,
the items for some reason do not, so shoppers in the bazaar are faced with
an array of mysterious effects that don't explain themselves.  The latest
summon set is the only one not suffering from this weird disadvantage,
bracelets clearly labled Burning Affliction I, II, II and IV, putting them
in with all the other BA focus items out there.

But worst of all, the items are Lore.  So you can summon one of each, put
them on your vendor, and hope they sell... but if you did manage to create
a market for them, they'd sell out and then no matter what demand was you'd
be unable to satisfy it while AFK.  You can only run "focus whore" live,
and you have to summon each item, one at a time, for single customers.  The
KEI whore next to you is doing groups with a single cast, you are doing
individuals and taking up to 6 casts to do each!

Not only does that impede Focus whores from operation (and really, who
cares, the whole whore thing is vaguely disturbing to begin with, I don't
mind something that prevents it being easy), but it really sucks for a
grouping mage; it should be a simple matter to log on, summon up several
sets of items while LFG, med back the lost mana, and only have to go into
mana debt for summoning pet when you get a group and get where you are
going.  Hand out items, though, means giving up your own, summoning
duplicates if more than one needs them, then replacing the ones you gave
away.  The benefit of being able to summon stuff up in advance is largely
lost, since you can't actually summon enough to equip a group.  Same goes
for buff casters, of course, they can buff themselves but have to wait
before buffing their group... its just a potential advantage to mages to
make up for the pain in the arse that summons can be that doesn't work.

Might be too early to be posting, that last sentence got wonky
