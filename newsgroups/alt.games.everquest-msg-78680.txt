I can confirm that from personal experience.  I used to play on a 56k modem,
but connected at 24k usually, 26.4k when I was lucky.  I switched to a 500k
up and down connection.  Zone times went down, but I noticed no differences
other than that.

I noticed a huge difference when I switched from a Voodoo3 card to a
GeForce2 card.  I also noticed a difference when I upgraded my cpu from a
Pentium MMX 200MHz to A PIII-800.
