When Verant created EQ, what did they have in mind ? A game where players
continually strive
to get better loot, level as fast as possible, gather platinum asap and kill
everything in sight ?
Or was it so like minded people can co-habit a on line Role Playing Game,
make friends,
hunt together, and help one another ? No race to the finish, no stress, no
stringent Guild
attitudes and rules (You WILL be there, You OWE US) ?

I've read the message boards. I know The Rathe encounter was beyond belief.
I've heard the
screams, the swears, the threats of mass account cancellation. I sympathise.
You guys have my
admiration to get as far as you have. That sort of dedication is impressive.
However.

Have people lost sight of what EQ was intended to be ? Is that what it's
about now ?

Yeah, you've already probably guessed what my answer would be.
I've played EQ for about 18 months now. My guild is no-where near Elemental
ready.
I'm not sure I care If it will ever be.

And yeah, I'm expecting someone will say something about a huge corporation
having EQ
as simply a cash cow. But I ask again - have people lost sight of it's point
? Or was it
always intended to be aimed towards the high end encounter ?

One again, I congratulate the guild's that are doing so well. Kudos to you
all, but I just
was interested to see others views on this.
