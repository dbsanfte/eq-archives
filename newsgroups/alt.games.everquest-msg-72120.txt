Funny how just being on the other side of the Atlantic makes a difference.
I wouldnt have thought twice about it, as it is a fairly commonly used word
here.

To me a "bit 'o aggro" usually means a drunken punch up after a football
match, or on a friday night after the pub. So the thought of a monster
(mob?) strolling through a dungeon looking for some aggro was quite
appealing to me.
