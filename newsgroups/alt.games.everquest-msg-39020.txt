This just dosent make sense . No one ever beats someone else over the head
in Eq and says you must use this item ! Yo momma may do so because she can
not afford to give you new stuff but that is an entirely diffrent type of
action and still a gift !

No one is stopping any newbie from doing it the hard way like everyone else
did at the beginning. No one is stopping the new player from learning and
growing slowly and camping there own equipment . The incredibly high
incidence of begging is also a fair indication you are wrong .

On the other hand the trivial loot code may do exactly that . I was using a
mammoth cloak for a very long time but I think that goblin was green when I
killed it . I was wearing polished bone bracers for a long while and I know
that those eyes where green when they finally dropped the goods instead of
my druid.
