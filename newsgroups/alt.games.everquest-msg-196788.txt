[Caveat:  All of the following constitutes one or more of hearsay,
personal observation, and opinion.  It is likely to be a waste of
effort to demand specific citations, this is a post to usenet, not
a paper given at scientific conference.]

KEI and, to a lesser degree, other long lasting buffs have changed
the social dynamics of the sub-50 game enormously.  The impact of
the ready availability of these buffs to lower level characters is
difficult to overstate and goes far beyond the impact of twinking.

1) It has always been possible to achieve good success playing
certain classes solo.  But with KEI you have two changes to the
solo vs. group dynamic in the game.  Firstly, it has mitigated one
of the chief drawbacks to traditional solo play:  downtime.  I've
known quite a few players who preferred grouping to soloing just
because they couldn't stand the time it took to med up with no one
there to talk to.  Second, it has made many marginal soloing classes
into strong soloing classes.  This has reduced the size of the
grouping player pool substantially in a way that twinking never did.
Those players who twinked heavily enough to have the same impact on
solo play as KEI does have always had a strong tendency to PL rapidly
through the lower levels, in essence they left the sub-50 grouping
player pool forever as soon as their main "graduated".  The advent
of KEI has had that same effect on far more players than twinking
ever did.

2) More and more of the players who remain in the grouping pool are
taking KEI and its cousins for granted, regarding players who do not
have the requisite buff(s) as undesirable when choosing groupmates.
This same effect has occurred with twinking, but I neither observed
nor heard of it happenning as often as it does with these long-
lasting uber group buffs.

3) The ease with which players can sustain constant action nowadays
has further crippled the social aspect of the game.  It often seems
to me as if every change to the game over the last year-and-a-half
or so has had the goal of moving the game closer towards an arcade
shoot 'em up and further from it's roleplaying roots.  It's pretty
sad when you have to play solo if you want to have some social
interaction, groups nowadays tend to be obsessed with kills per
second and nothing else, the closest thing to conversation goes
something like:
"afk, bio break"
"ok, hurry, 3 inc"

4) The rate at which characters can move through levels has an
effect on the "value" they place on those levels.  Martin PL'd his
Rogue to 65 in what, three weeks?  He isn't going to attach much
importance to them at all.  With KEI, any determined first-time
player can make 51 easily in less than 2 months (assuming they're
playing a caster).  KEI has effectively trivialized the lower
levels in the minds of (very nearly) the entire playing population.
Many of the other changes, from the removal of all difficulty in
the sub-11 game to the PoK portals (Ed's favorite!) have "helped",
but KEI did the most damage.

There you have it, most of what I don't like about KEI and the
"new" sub-50 game.  ymmv
