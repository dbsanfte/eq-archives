Well, my contributions to this group are tiny in comparison to the regulars,
but I have no complaints whatsoever about anything I've posted being used.
I was under the impression that Usenet postings were public domain, and that
no permission was necessary for a person to use them as he or she saw fit.
I could be wrong though.  In any case, it's very nice of you to ask.

Best of luck with the project.
