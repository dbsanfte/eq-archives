    If it's a planned outage, then even if it goes long I find it silly to
complain about it. You knew it was coming, you know they always go long,
planning something that starts right when the outage ends isn't wise.

    If it's an unplanned outage, I think the players do have the right to be
upset. We have people in my guild that have busy lives, and have to plan
ahead to be able to attend key raids when we want numbers. Telling someone
that gave up their Utah Jazz season ticket for the night so they could help
the guild achieve a first "whoops, memory leak, our bad" isn't good enough.
Yes, my guild has people with Utah Jazz (another cleric) and Vancouver
Canucks (me) seasons tickets. We do have to plan ahead.

    James
