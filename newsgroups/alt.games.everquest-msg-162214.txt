No, I fully understood your 'plight'.  I only meant that you *could* have
figured it out fairly easily.  Just price one, add 19, and if the price
changes then it was per unit and if it doesnt then it is per stack.  Then
press the add button.  When you have a problem, try thinking for yourself
about how to solve it before you ask.  You *will* be ahead in the long run.
