3 years?!! More like every year and it hasn't slowed down at all.
Go to any Computer retailer and see for yourself.. "You want a
athalon, we got 4 , what speed you want. Pentuim, no problem we got
plenty but if you wait, in the next 2 months we'll have the P5. Video
cards,well you can't have the latest card unless your  PC can handle
it. Why that like putting a Hemi in a Pinto,sure it might go faster
but you'll be unstable as hell.
