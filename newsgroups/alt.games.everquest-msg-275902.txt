Hehehe she sure would be confused by me and my husband.  I play a male
barbarian shaman and he plays a female high elf enchanter as our mains.
We mostly did it for esthetic reasons.  Myself I just can't stand the female
barbarian casting it looks like they are doing aerobics or something.
Most of the guilds I have been in have had a pretty even ratio of male to
female with a lot of couples playing.
People of all ages play the game from elementary school age to senior
citizens.
The only expansion I would suggest getting would be Shadows of Luclin so you
have access to the bazaar and Paludal Caverns (refered ingame as PC) it is
the best experience for lvl 15-25 and most people spend those levels there.
It's not by any means my favourite zone but if you aren't getting anywhere
on your own and can't get a group elsewhere there is plenty to solo and
group in pc.
