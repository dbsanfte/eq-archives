Hi, does everyone know a good weapon for a human warrior? I am a level 31 human
warrior and the weapon I am currently using is 18 DMG and 37 delay. Does anyone
know a weapon that I can get thats affordable? (right now i have about 700pp)
and also, one thats better than what I have?

Also, what is the best weapon for a warrior? And whats the ATK and delay on it?
Thank you
