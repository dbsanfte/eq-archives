Same here.  My first Qeynos to Freeport run was done at level *6*. 
Believe it or not, I asked the GM for a quest to reverse my PvP.  Back
then, being PvP on a blue server was a very bad flaw.

The GM arranged for a quest at the Temple of Marr and I had a lot of fun
getting that curse lifted.  I still killed the character off at level 18,
but I never forgot how frightening that first run across Antonica was.

That was four years ago.
