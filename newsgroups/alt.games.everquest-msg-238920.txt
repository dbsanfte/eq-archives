Yes, they can remove the recipe or stop the ingredients from dropping.
Even better, change the recipe to create a new nerfed weapon.

I'd guess it's more like they felt they shouldn't be left, not that they
thought it would be gamebreaking if they left them.

I'm not sure of how overpowered a 5/11 weapon is, but I don't think it's
better than many high end weapons (that aren't droppable though).

Of course, you'd think they'd learnt by now how damage bonus works, after
already making the same mistake with the moss covered twig, but then this
is Sony we're talking about.
