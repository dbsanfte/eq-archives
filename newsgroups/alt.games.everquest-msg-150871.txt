I had played EQ for months without one crash on my computer.  After the
early September patch (think it was about that time for the patch), I
started crashing about once per day.  In the two hours I have played since
downloading the last patch, I have crashed three times.  Argggghhhhh!  I
guess the next patch will give me a message saying "Instead of spending
programming time making Everquest even more unusable on your system, we are
simply deleting the software from your computer.  Thanks for the
subscription fees!"
