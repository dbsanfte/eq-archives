Listen to me again.

IF god is:
(1) Omniscient (knows all things -- past, present, future), and
(2) Omnipotent (can give us free will)

THEN:
(1) God can make people with free will that he KNOWS won't burn
    in hell for all eternity, and
(2) God can AVOID making people with free will that he KNOWS
    will burn in hell for all eternity

If YOUR god sends people to hell -- YOUR god SUCKS.
