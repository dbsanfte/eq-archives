I did bother. Obviously, we have different definitions of the word
"many". That, or you mixed the wrong medications again...

And, actually, one thing I agree about. Camping wasn't the intent of

get lucky. Camping is just how players CHOOSE to handle it. No, the
system isn't broken. The players are the problem.
