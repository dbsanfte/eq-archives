> Didn't the xp bonus in LOIO get nuked a few months back?

Well if it did get nuked, then LoIO is still a great place to level.

The only down fall is that you don't learn real dungeon skills there. I have
managed to get some very different groups to Pull like crazy though.
The best skill I am learning in LoIO is Tactics for Group Makeup. You play a
lot different with 3 Wizzys, A Shammy, A Bard, and an Enchanter than you do
with 1 Wizzy, 2 wars, a CL, a rouge, and an SK.

The 3 Wizzy group dropped Mobs fast, Like less than 15 Seconds a Mob, but
when we were OOM, things came to a stand still.

Needless to say, LoIO is still a great place to get xp...so long as you are
learning how to work together too.....
