So much for getting to 57 so I can cast succor to geet our guild to WW. Ok,
this ones not as good, but who cares about 150 mana, once at the beginning
of a session. The level seems way way low to me, and I dont think this is
gonna be a deciding factor in getting people down dungeons. (who cares if
they are down dungeons or not, whats the big deal about it anyway). Seems to
me the mobs have an inherant advantage down dungeons, and it seems to me
that is the biggest problem. Maybe if we didnt have mobs that always outrun
us (or teleport if they need to), and never give up the chase, then dungeons
might become more popular.
