Easy..    Chanters are very popular, in Rathe Mountains(well everywhere
actually), and you can make some serious scratch on your way to 40.  Unless
you're twinked (which I have no problem with by the way) you probably need
some cash.  Mind you  Hill Giants arent really great xp, but are pretty easy
to hunt once you get your "Hill Giant killin" formula down
