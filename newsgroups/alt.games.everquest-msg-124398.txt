But druids aren't THAT kind of priest Dennis.  Druids are priests of
nature.  They're sole purpose, from a role play perspective, is to
preserve and protect nature.  Think Cros Treewind and the havoc he
used to raise in Qeynos Hills.  If anything druids shouldn't have the
heal spells they have and have MORE offensive power.  Since they are
in tune with nature, they can track all the things in the wild.

From a game balance perspective, druids are a utility class.  A jack
of all trades.  Don't have a wizard, a druid can nuke.  Don't have a
cleric, a druid can heal.  Need to travel, druids can do that almost
as well a wizards.  No ranger around and you gotta find a mob, a druid
can fill that spot.

Not that a druid is NEARLY as good at any of these things as they
specialist class they are filling if for, but they can do all of the
jobs in a pinch.  And trust me, speaking as a 52 druid AND a 49
ranger, you don't have to worry about druids stealing rangers thunder
with regards to tracking.  Ranger tracking is so ridiculously superior
as to be silly.

I can appreciate that you really REALLY care for the ranger class, but
you can be rather obtuse on the subject.  IMHO, naturally.
