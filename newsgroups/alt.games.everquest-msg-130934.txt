Happily married, while he gets other men have to satisfy his wife. I guess if
that's happily married then he's one of the few that thinks that.

Having been ecstatically married for 20+ years I cannot relate to your

I simply maintain that no one's actions "control" anyone elses
actions.

To allow that possibility would naturally lead to the idea that there
is a god..

And, of course, that is pure fantasy...  :^)
