I believe City of Heroes was similar, although I didn't start that until 
after someone posted here about how interesting it was, so wouldn't have 
seen any launch bugs that were quickly fixed.

I was in DAoC from launch, and that too had very few bugs.

I think some MMORPG developers just get lazy.  They know they can patch, 
so they get sloppy in testing.
