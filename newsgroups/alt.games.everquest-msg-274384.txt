I played a shaman in EQ and I am playing a shaman in EQ2. They are very
different in many ways, as is the game as a whole. So far, as the previous
poster said, all classes appear to be soloable to a degree, and a shaman is
no exception. The major difference in the game, is that no class can solo
all the way to the top. It simply isn't possible given all of the Hallmark
quests you must complete along the way, as many of them require a group to
complete. The good news is that because everyone now requires groups that it
is much easier to find a group when you need one.

The really good thing about group vs. solo in EQ2 is that since most classes
can solo with equal ease, there is always something to do even when you
can't find a group. There are always easy, roaming MOB's about to bother
while you are waiting for an invite. There are always soloable quests or
portions of quests to complete, harvestable items to gather and exploring to
do if you can't find a group right away.
