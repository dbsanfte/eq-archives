Strictly stated, the items in Everquest belong to Verant. But I
understand what you're trying to say - you're still incorrect.

If you pick up a pile of stuff in EQ, you're not taking something that
doesn't belong to you. You're picking up something that doesn't belong
to anyone.

Hidden in a library book, hidden in a back room. What's the
