Well, this refers to a different game and all that, but.... 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4165880.stm

As you will note, this guy had it down to a fine art!  These bots
("...difficult for human game players to defeat") were robbing players
of items that they had worked damn hard for, and that's assuming they
didn't actually pay RL cash for their items in the first place, as
some games legitimately let you do these days.

I've actually seen a game where the newbie zones had bots casting AE
spells on mobs that came in range, automatically farming the rare
drops, 24/7, week in, week out.  Actual newbies couldn't get a look
in, and they couldn't even scavenge the leavings because only the
person who killed the mob could loot it.  Result?  The a large
proportion of newbies quit the game asap, even though it was free to
play, because they could see it would be even worse in the
higher-level zones.

No, there has to be a line drawn somewhere.  It's not the bots we have
NOW you need to necessarily plan ahead for - it's the next generation
of the little buggers that might get you, if left unchecked.  The fact
that players also farm stuff 24/7 is irrelevant, because they are
merely what my friends and I call "wet-bots", i.e. a human "farm bot"
that can avoid the standard bot traps programmed into games because
they can vary their behaviour and respond to questions from GM's.
They're just as damaging in the long term as any other bot.
