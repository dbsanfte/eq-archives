Well... If you want uber-guilds, why not go for the uberest of uber-guilds,
Fires of Heaven (FoH) on Veeshan server?  Although, each server will have
(except maybe Sullon) usually one or two UBER guilds, but there are still a
lot of high level guilds (level 55+ membership requirement) that are usually
a LOT more mature than the uber guild "kewl d00dz" that seem to be more
prolific; example is that the UBER guilds are usually 12 year olds who used
to play Quake all day, so they have a comparable immature mindset, whereas
the high level non-uber guilds tend to be more mature, maybe tradeskillers
(how many people in FoH had mastered a tradeskill before the shawl quest?)
and perhaps even RolePlayers (gasp!).
BTW, I hate waiting for boats, but at least they give good RP opportunities
=P.

"Less Newbies?" -- hmm... well, if you consider twinks newbies, then you're
SOL on just about any server, otherwise, you're still SOL, because there's
ALWAYS noobs showing up, on any server, even Rallos Zek, although from what
I hear, the worst of the lot hangs out on Sullon Zek

Bread is in limited supploy on Antonica, I know Paineel has a limitless
supply in Good Iva's, not sure about Erudin, they tend to kill me unless I
just run straight through to the boat there.

The village in East Karana near the Gorge of King Xorbb zone line seems in
my experience to have an unlimited supply of bread/muffins (used these
muffins to faction farm with that dorf in freeport, hehe)
