That's ok, not sure I do either.  Stein of Moggok has 3 charges of light 
heal on it, so theoretically, I could heal while you do crowd control.  
For almost, um... 3.1 seconds? :) Right after I posted I realized Rune V 
would be a -much- better option for taking over your job, at only a 
peridot per 600ish points pre-healed.

The joke part is, sure, cleric go do CC in a time-intensive way, even 
though there's a perfectly good enc sitting right here... Ok, guess I'm 
main healer then, right? :)
