In order to use plains pebbles for tailoring they have to be Imbued. It will
take a druid that follows Karana to cast that spell. Imbued Plains Pebbles
are for class, deity (yes, Karana) specific armor. Considering the market
for this armor is almost non-existent it's pretty much a waste of time.
You'd probably spend way too much time TRYING to find a buyer for them and
wouldn't justify the little amount of money you'd get for them.
