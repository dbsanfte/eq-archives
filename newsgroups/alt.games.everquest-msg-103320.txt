And, for a second, I thought you didn't care...

You were, are, and will probably remain wrong that the channel is not
meant for dewds to talk about their uberness. Just because you don't
like dewds (I don't either) doesn't mean everything they do is wrong.

The problem was, is, and will probably remain that I'm *not* saying
anything wrong. The channel wasn't being used incorrectly at all, from
the evidence we were given. It's not a hard thing to figure out,
though admittedly it does seem beyond you.

It was a channel meant for all out of character conversation. What was
being discussed qualifies. You are wrong AGAIN!

Ooops! Switched to a strawman did you? Show where I said it was meant
exclusively for that purpose, please.

Doh! Can't find it? Don't worry, we're not going anywhere....

Perhaps in TwoheadWorld ad hominem attacks are viable replacements for
intelligent debate. In this world they are not.

Right back at ya. LOL
