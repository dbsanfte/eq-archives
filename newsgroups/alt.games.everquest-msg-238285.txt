You=idiot.

Run like hell. I have not even read the rest of this, but I know
exactly where it is going. You don't want to be involved with a
person not loyal to her husband, or who was doing things with a
married man (even though they are only in game.) This person has
"flee" emblazoned on a big ass flag that they continually waved around
in the light of day, right under your nose, while you ignored this.
Flee.

Snip lots of overly obvious things happening, that everyone could
see a mile away.

The reality is:

1) "She" was probably a man, laughing at you the whole time, possibly 
with friends.

2) the "husband" was a friend or the alt of the same person.

3) you = pretty darn gullible.

Here is something to remember about online games like this in general:

Everyone playing another character in the game is a 45 year old fat
bald guy wearing a wife beater with tomato sauce stains. Just remember
that and it makes playing MUCH easier.
Play some female characters yourself and NEVER tell anyone that you
are male, you start to get it.

It doesn't even matter if they are really female, you are NOT going to
hook up with any of these people. For all practical purposes just play
like you are the character and always assume the real life sex of the
person is not what they portray.

You should not have given your things away, instead you should have
chalked it up as learning a lesson. Just consider yourself lucky that
it did not end in you getting scammed out of all of your equipment or
anything.

The best thing about these simulations is that they offer a safe
buffer around the player from real life concerns, such as being dumped
on or scammed. The instance that you do something stupid, this is no
longer true. So don't do the something stupid. That buffer is there to
be used, so that you can log on to this simulation and feel safe and
out of danger, playing equally with everyone and ignoring anything to
do with real life. 

I used to play on the tribunal and there were several types of "black
widow" characters there. They'd manipulate the unwary, sometimes even
entire guilds to get an epic or something, and they eventually became
fairly infamous. Just don't fall for the sob stories. I remember one
person who even tried to convince people she had a boyfriend who beat
on her with baseball bats and she was confined to a wheel chair, while
someone else would hear the story of how she was a dancer (the two are
mutually exclusive, if you have not figured it out.) That is why I
turn off tales of real life. "Hey, I don't have any legs!" 

"Ah ok, well its time to slay the dragon!"

"I said I don't have any legs in real life!"

"Whatever, anyway its time to slay the dragon!"

"NO LEGS!"

"SHUT THE FUCK UP, I DON'T CARE, DRAGON!"
