Allowing a player that was exploiting to complete the tournament
rather than pulling him out immediately would have thrown the results
out of whack. The exploiting player could well have knocked out others
who might have had a chance to come in on top or close to it. The
decision had to be made quick and acted on immediately. Unfortunately,
the evidence the decision was based on was faulty. In the end, nothing
was lost but the chance at winning a game he may well have not won
anyway. Key word here, though, is *GAME*.

I fault the diplomacy on both sides, but not the action taken.
