Actually, warrior's fast aggro is pretty reliable these days.  Since getting
my level 69 discipline, even with tash and slow being done on incoming,
99.5% of the time our enchanter will not take even one combat round worth of
damage.   If it's our shaman doing it, then it's about 99.9% of the time, as
Malo has no aggro.

Holding aggro is even easier.     It's just a matter of 20 Everfrost LDoNs
(assuming 65 normals).   Unless someone is activly *trying* to take aggro,
they just won't get hit.   Compared to the old days, a braindead monkey
could play a successful warrior now.
