Wait! Wait! Read what I have to say before you flame me!

A little while ago, I bought Evolutions for my fiance because he'd
expressed some interest in the two of us playing together. Well, for
various reasons, it looks like that's not going to be happening. So I
have this set that I'm likely not going to be using. I could just keep
it, since I'm not really concerned about the minimal amount of money it
cost me, but honestly at the moment just seeing the damn box is kinda
pissing me off (don't ask). The box itself has been opened (I was
curious if there were any nifty things inside like maps and such), but
the CD keys haven't been used. Is there any way I could get this to
someone who might benefit from it, if I decide not to keep it? Or is
there not really any way to prove the keys haven't been used yet (I
wouldn't bother to give it away/sell it if that's the case)?

Thanks in advance.
