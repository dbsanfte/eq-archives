    (1) Bats see through all forms of invis, including Hide/Sneak.
    (2) IF the wanderer is a bat and IF it's between the GIBs and the bat
cave area, you are hosed. However, if that isn't the case you can usually
slide along the left hand wall and stay safe, as the bats don't have a huge
aggro radius. Rosy (my rogue) did this at level 30 to go get her mask, and
was never in danger.
