This is endemic to this style of game.

Which is going to go over better with the player base?

"We set blah to be about twice as high as needed, so we're setting it
back down a bit again."

"we raised blah last week, but not enough. We'll raise it a bit more
this week. And next week. And the week after that. Until we get it
right. But, hey, at least we're not over-raising it, right?"

Taking away a lot and then giving some back is an easier "sell" than
taking away a little bit each patch.
