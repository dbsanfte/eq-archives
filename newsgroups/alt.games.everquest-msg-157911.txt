All i gotta say is




LOL




That and the fact that you just got a cheal spell in addition
to being instantly able to port yourself around (without the need
to be in a city zone), buffs, heals, nukes, dots and whatever else.
Druids are a dime a dozen on any server and a lot of people (myself included)
have made druids to be port whores. I made 1k a day porting people around
and god did it get boring. Now I log my druid in when i need to help
someone, either with ports or some buffs. So you got it pretty good
already. Verant gave you some improvements so just STFU. The expansion hasnt
been out for a week yet but in game and in message boards I hear the cryin
a beginnin.


On a side note.......GOLLY GEE WHIZ THE TASHANIA QUEST JUST GOT A LOT EASIER!
Lol...it wasnt exactly hard before but tedious with all the walking around.

Or having to pay a druid big cash to port you around  :P
