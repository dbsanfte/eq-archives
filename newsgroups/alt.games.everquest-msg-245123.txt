Easy or hard? For easy.. i still say the best puller is a Warrior who
just doesn't care :> I've only seen two bards that could keep up with
me and once they realized what I was looking for and to remove all the
safeguards, it went fine. The funny part about easy ldon is that at
the early levels it keeps trying to teach you to finesse it, and after
you are 65 and decent gear its all about forgetting all that and just
rolling through the dungeon with reckless abandon. I personally
couldn't stand easy ldon unless we were always teetering on the edge
of wipe, if that took 4, 6, or 8 mobs in camp to do. You really find
out who are the players then.. and ninja-botting would always produce
disasterous results hehehe.
