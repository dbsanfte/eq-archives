Yup, that's charm for you, just deal with it and charm again... I 
haven't found that charisma makes a difference, although if you are a 
halfling and your charisma is below 75, you may do well to invest on 
bringing it up to at least that figure.

Later charms will be all over the place in respect to their duration... 
Sometimes they will break straight away, sometimes they will outlast 
Ensnare. Just make sure that your pet is always Ensnared (even going as 
far as breaking charm and re-ensnaring if your charm is lasting a long 
time) and you'll be okey. If you can afford it, invest on a Goblin 
Gazughi Ring. The ability to break charm at will is invaluable.

Also, make sure you invest on your level's pet haste... You probably 
have Savage Spirit already by level 50.
