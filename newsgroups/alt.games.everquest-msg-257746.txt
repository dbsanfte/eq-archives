Oh my goodness, I didn't realise that I shouldn't be able to
raise my Swimming skill without risk.  Or my Brewing skill.

What's that you say?  We're talking combat skills?  Those things
that I should be able to train up by hiring a swordsmaster to
spar with me?  Sure, there's some risk he'll hit me, but he's an
expert, so he knows how to teach me without much risk of harm.
But there aren't swordsmasters in the game (except guildmasters,
and there's a limit to how much they'll teach you), so instead I
hire a mage to let me practice sparring against his pet.  The
only reason I can see for it to be an exploit is that he and I
could set it up and go to bed while my character skills up.  I
agree that's weak, but if something required that I pay attention
to the fight (e.g. to turn autoattack back on every few minutes),
I don't think it should be considered an exploit.
