Heh, $10K just for the ring?  It better be the Diamond Wedding Ring from 
ToFS or something. :) But no, you got her to settle for a 10K ring... 
Doesn't mean she didn't -want- you to spend $50K.  And as to cheap... My 
ex-wife's ring cost $40.  Not including shipping. :)  We were pretty 
lucky.  We both have rather simple/unusual tastes that made the whole 
wedding under $2000.  Just as well, since it didn't work out. :)
