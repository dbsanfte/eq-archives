    No, as they were horribly broken before the caster patch. These things
are the same level as a sonic bat or lower, but hit like a ton of bricks,
have more HPs than the sonic bats, have a worse proc than the sonic bats,
and occasionally have cleric spells. Having them get Judgement with the
patch really just reinforces the idea that nobody should hunt them for
anything but quest drops.
