Yes, I agree, CHeal is not only for warriors... its just most effective on
them, pound for pound.  Same level, same STA and HP gear, same
buffs, the warrior is going to have far more HP.

On the other hand, at some levels, a monk may be a more effective
main assist in some encounters... because they don't get hurt as
much.  I haven't had the opportunity to test this out at post 50
levels, nor did I do anything exhaustive in the 40s, but I found
that time between heals was longer on a monk than on a warrior,
and while its interesting to think in terms of HP per mana, really
the measure we -should- be using is mana spent per minute,
or mana spent per kill.
