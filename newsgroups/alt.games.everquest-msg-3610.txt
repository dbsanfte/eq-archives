Also, there is a NPC near by at the famers and merchants that is named
Aragon or something similar...Last night I saw three of the same guy at the
same time at the same locality. He acted like a guard for the farmers and
even helped me with a green lion when I was medding. All conned indifferent
to me and had no reply when hailed. I switched to three other characters and
got the same results. He was red to my 21 Shaman. Over the past two years I
have noticed several strange "bugs" or programming abnormalities in this
area more often than any other including Highpass (with all its grouping
bugs.) Anyone know if they test stuff there or why the crazy stuff id always
appearing there?
