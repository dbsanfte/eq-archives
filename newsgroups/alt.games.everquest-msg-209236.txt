Yes. There were numerous problems with Warder's pets... but this simply
reaffirms my beleif that its extraordinarily difficult to retrofit zoning
pets in EQ...

It is a *design* issue. If  they had wanted to zone pets, it would not have
been difficult to design a system that facilitated that... maybe they'd get
attached to the player's character record, ie contain space in the character
record for your pet type, pet equipment, pet buffs, name etc... then it
would be a no brainer to zone pets around... the pets status would get saved
when ever your character gets saved... etc... then pets could have persisted
logging in, logging out, zoning,

Yes it hard to change NOW... but what reason was their for deciding not to
allow it when it would have easy... even trivial to allow. I have yet to
hear any good reason that makes sense from the design stage.
