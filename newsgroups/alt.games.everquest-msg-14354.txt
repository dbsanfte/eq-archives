Say you're starting a guild of your friends, since you've got a lot of 
them, and it'd be nice to have a channel by which to keep in touch.  After 
a careful analysis of the situation, you find that thirteen of your 
friends are interested in the idea and not already in a guild they're 
happy with.  So you decide it'd be a lovely idea to go ahead and start the 
guild.  Guild formation day comes, and seven of your friends show up.  
Harry and his wife are moving that day, Fergel is still in school until 
6pm, Beth is out of town on a business trip, and you have no idea what 
happened to Alice and Rachel, but their characters aren't on line.  So... 
do you scrap the idea, or try and dig up two more people quick before the 
GM gets here?  After all, who knows, they might be nice friendly sorts 
that would fit in well... it's just like setting the LFG tag, but a bit 
more long-term.

}Maybe it's just that some people feel a need to show
}their  guild tag as a status symbol. 

Well, it can be.  I was hanging out with a couple guys in Guk, and they 
asked about my guild.  It was obviously significant to them that they'd 
never had any troubles with people from my guild, except Percy, who we'd 
had troubles with ourselves.  They were glad to hear he'd decided to stay 
behind when we moved from Karana to Ayonae. :)

}A typical example:
}His closer: "You shouldn't be so choosy, in that case."

Yep, he's desperate.  He's also a lousy salesman. :)

}Now the truth is that I solo most of the time and I
}really don't have any aspirations of guildhood. Regardless,
}I can't see that joining some random guild is going to
}somehow raise my status to the point where the
}"good guilds" will see my worth and invite me to
}join THEM.

Well because someone in your guild gets to know someone in a good guild, 
and they plan a raid together...

}Am I missing the boat on guilds? How many of you
}got recruited as part of an "ad campaign" and how many
}of you are still with those guilds?

Well, I didn't really get caught in an 'ad campaign' as far as I know... I 
was just merrily whacking skellies in Nektulos and met this nice girl from 
arizona, who got me invited to her guild.  And I'm still in it.  In fact, 
I have 7 characters in that guild now...  I think the guild leader may 
have been in a recruiting mood that day.  She does seem to get that mood 
now and then, and go to Nektulos and hook up a bunch of lowbies.  Some of 
them work out well, some of them come in going "wherez the phat lewtz!?!"  
The latter don't last long, strangely enough.  I got the recruiting bug 
last night, and hooked up a couple new folks in Oasis.  Sure, I barely 
know them from Adam, but how much better than Adam am I going to get to 
know them in EQ, really, unless I end up grouping with them a significant 
number of times (which rarely happens because I'm a slow leveller), or 
they join the guild?
