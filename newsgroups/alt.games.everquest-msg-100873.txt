No.

Another option is to have someone train him away though, of course.
You grab him, bring him to the giants, and go back and move the
corpse. Wuoshi will spend fifteen or so minutes killing them all (they
won't win). At that point the person who initially kited better zone
because Wuoshi will be hurt and will summon him. :-)

Watching Wuoshi fight all the giants is one of my fonder memories.
