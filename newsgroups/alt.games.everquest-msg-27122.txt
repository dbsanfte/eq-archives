Y'know , I reckon these folks just dont understand the concept of
roleplaying - I dont think that necessarily makes them stupid if
they dont come from a background where they've been exposed to the
idea. Its like playing cowboys and indians as a child - you dont
play a cowboy, really, you play yourself in a cowboys environment.

That drawing of a clear distinction between *you* and your character,
who may be entirely different in terms of personality and behaviour,
seems to be what baffles them.

They accept a change in environment - Norrath, vs Earth - but dont
even conceive of a change in themselves...
