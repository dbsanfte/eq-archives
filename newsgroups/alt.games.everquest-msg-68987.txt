It's time for me to stop admiring the scenery and do some hunting...

Any suggestions for good places on luclin for a 30th level human necro to
hunt?

And my 9th lebel bard is getting good experience in the warrens but would
like a change of scenery so any luclin suggestions for him?  It seems to me
that it would difficult to get him through higher level zones to the lower
ones.
