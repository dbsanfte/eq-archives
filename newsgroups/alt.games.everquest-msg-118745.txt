I remember in the first week or so of velious, when Wuoshi had a pet,
I had a level 3 rogue out there exploring.  (had my LFG flag on too.
:-) )  At that time I was able to walk up and hug wuoshi as long as
sneak/hide stayed active.

Every time I've checked after the bear pet went away (that's a whole
nother story), she has been able to see invis.  Not sure if the 2
changes went in with the same patch, but they possibly happened about
the same time.
