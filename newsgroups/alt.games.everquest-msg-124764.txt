I learned this the hard way too.  Now, unless I am doing charity work
of my own freewill and accord, I've realized that if I don't respect
my own time (leaving aside the argument that EQ is a complete waste of
time ;) ) other people will gladly NOT respect it too.  Along those
lines, when Im on my druid, I have NO problem NOT responding to any
request that does NOT have a fixed amount attached to it.  Also, I
have NO problem asking for payment up front.  Anyone who is not
willing to pay up front after advertising a request for a service IMHO
demonstrates that they themselves are untrustworthy of the very
goodwill they themselves seek.  Personally when someone agrees to do
something, I have NO problem getting a /report (see previous posts on
this) and then paying up front (if the amount in question is
substantial to me). Any variance on their stated agreement quickly
leads to fraud, which is a warnable offense (if I want to take it that
far).  Granted this is excessive in most cases, but on large "ticket"
transactions, it has worked for me before.  I may lose some "money" at
times preferring a stated amount up front or by asking for payment
first (for those who are incredibly easy to offend), but I do not have
to live with the feeling of feeling ripped off of time and effort. 
Given that this is a game, I'd rather have less plat and less bad
feelings, so it works for me.
