They may be the same drivers. The ones I used were dated 8/26 (or 
somewhere around there). My other sys info is an Athalon 1700xp and 512m 
of ram. Also, I haven't spend too much time in testing as I just loaded 
new drivers a few days ago but the major "test" I did was leave EQ on for 
nearly 12 hours (few hours of xp'ing, 8 hrs for that sleep thing letting 
mule sell in bazaar, then a few more xp hours) and NO problems.

I intend to do LOTS more testing (damn addictive game) for verification.

Hope this helps somebody
