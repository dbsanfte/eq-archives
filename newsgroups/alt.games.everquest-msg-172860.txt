It depends which BR you kill.  There are three of them that can spawn one of
the shaman epic mobs, Lord Ghiosk, Rak'Ashiir, or Neh'Ashiir.  I have never
noticed the BRs spawning any other mob in the times I have been there.  The
BRs can spawn another BR when killed, and this can continue for a long time,
although it is rare, most I have personally seen was 5.  I have never seen a
BR morph into any other type of mob, they always remained BRs.
