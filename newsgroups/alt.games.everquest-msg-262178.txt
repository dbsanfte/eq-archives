shame?

try it. it works.

We aggrokited elder panda add (36th level, while hunting highland 
Kobolds with a group of 20's (20-22) for a concrete example).

We also took a Rygorr Elite Guard at with a group at 30th the same way.

I may have over spoke with 15-20. But 12-17 for sure. And I don't see 
any reason why 15-20 isn't possible, maybe even higher. Raid mobs can be 
15+ levels up and we *know* melee's can hit *them* so whats hard to 
beleive about a group of 30's aggrokiting at 45+ mob with no special 
abilities whatsoever?

It took way too long to be efficient for xp. But with SoW it was 
reasonably easy to run circles around the mob for ever. It wouldn't work 
against mobs with high regen, but if you can overcome a mobs regen, and 
the mob is never hitting you eventually it will come down.
