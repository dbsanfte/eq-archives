Now that is a very interesting question. I logged in to EQIM as my Main,
expecting to see my Trader on line, and it wasn't. I assumed one of the
random disconnects I get, and that still may be the case.

However, whilst trying to diagnose some of the problems with EQIM, I had it
installed on 2 PCs here. And I quickly noticed that, having logged on to
PC1, if I logged on to PC2 as the same ACCOUNT, and picked any character on
the same SERVER as the one on PC1, the PC1 client was disconnected
immediately. And vice versa. This is consistent with not being able to log
in with two characters on the same account and server at the same time. But
my concern now is that when I logged to EQIM as my Main, my Trader IN GAME
was disconnected ....

If this is true, and I won't be able to tell until I get home, the
possibilities for abuse are frightening ....
