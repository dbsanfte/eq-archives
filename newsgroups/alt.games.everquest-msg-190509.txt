I've not played a paladin nor a cleric over level 10, so I could be
completely out of line here.  This is the only suggestion I can
make.  Which is basically that the paladin could engage a mob, get it down
to about 3/4 health and throw in a stun for aggro, then turn it's back to
the mob (ie, get rid of ripostes) and let the cleric finish off the
mob.  Hopefully the paladin can keep aggro by occasionally sitting down or
tossing in a low-level stun.

Again, as others have said, a paladin isn't exactly the ideal power
leveller, but if I HAD to use to use a Paladin, that is what I'd
try.  If you were going to twink out the cleric with high ac/hp gear, I'd
have the paladin just sit back and heal probably, but without twinking,
the cleric probably won't be able to take hits as well as your pally.
