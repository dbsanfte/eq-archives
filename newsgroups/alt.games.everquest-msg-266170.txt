Well, I'd certainly appreciate letting us, or more specifically *me* know. 
:-)

While I'm not looking for any handholding, it'd be nice to know that I know 
someone on the same server at least, because I've about decided I'm going to 
be a lost lamb, based on a couple of the more recent EQ2-related threads.

Cripes--among other things it appears like I'm going to have to learn 
another language . . . :-(

If you need to email, then chainbreaker (naturally) at comcast dot
