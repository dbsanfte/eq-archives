I think so.  At least, roughly that.  I have had my horse actually fade 
before.  Very very rarely.

I really doubt it.  EE doesn't generally affect clicky-item buffs

Heh.  I'm starting to get the assorted channeling AAs...  It's suddenly 
even -harder- to be sure I'm interrupting a spell on horseback.

Really? Hm.  I play a friend's druid some, and somehow I never noticed 
that.  Probably because I always forget to summon her mount. :)

Yay foraging machete!

A... druid... using bind wounds?  Ok...  Just because I'd be too lazy to 
raise that skill doesn't mean it's a bad idea, I suppose. :)

It's VoQ with a root component :)

Heh.  My warrior has just gotten up to where she can tank 
mobs-that-summon.  Lots of fun while twoboxing, get good aggro, switch to 
the healer, see "you will not evade me Medb!" So naturally I have to 
switch and back up so I'm not staring at the area behind the mob again.

Well, from watching my druid friend, who actually -does- remember to 
summon her mount, I'd say the others are dead on.  It's for groups where 
you're healing and buffing.  It'd be okay for root-rotting if you could 
click it off during the pulling part, but hardly necessary.  I'm not sure 
how it'd work out for porcupining, and it's definitely not for quadding.  
Definitely. :)

Similarly, grouped wizards will love it, but not quadding wizards.  
Grouped enchanters (which nobody else mentioned! Waah, so unloved!) will 
love it...  Well, I hardly use it anymore.  I have FT15, MC3, and gather 
mana, and can VoQ myself... I can't really remember the last time I 
actually ran out of mana.  Well, and it mattered.  So given that, why chew 
through my Misty Thicket Picnics at twice the rate and suffer the snare? 
:) Necros may feel similarly with a lot less AA.  It seems like there's a 
theme of practically any priest/caster in a group loving it (unless 
they're pulling) and pretty much only shamans/mages wanting it for 
soloing.

Ok ok, it -is- handy when the raid wipes, my MGB is still down, and I'm 
the only enchanter and have to reVoQ/VQ/GoD 10 groups... And it can be 
handy when I want to chain nuke Raid_Mob_001 and not get aggro. :)
