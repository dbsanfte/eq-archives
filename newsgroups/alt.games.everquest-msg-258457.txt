Must have read what you wrote wrong then.  Sounded like you weren't
commenting on the see invis portion at all.

*shrug*   Remember you're speaking to someone who doesn't have a plainsight
item.   In fact, the only one I've seen that I had even a chance of getting
so far was the Helmet of Rallos Zek, which was selling for 200k in the
bazaar on E'ci.   (I currently have about 12k in my bank roll.)

Getting 5 or 10 AA points will take a hell of a lot less time than getting
200k+ platinum.   And I don't have to worry about losing it because I
suddenly got an even better helm.

There are plenty of *great* EB items, as Faerune combines Plainsight and EB
in one.   But if you're like me, and not raiding Plane of Time regularly,
thats not really a consideration.   I'm unlikely to ever get one of those.

You mean both of the players who bought it?

They've gone well beyond that.

Sure, it would take *forever* to raise every tradeskill to max (especially
if you don't enjoy that sort of thing)... but you can't deny that an earring
with 25 ac, 25 all stats, 15 all resists, 145 hp 30 atk, 3 regen is damn
nice.   (Caster one has FT 3 plus a focus effect, little less hp, lot more
mana)

You can also repeat steps to get the next to last upgrade and wear both...
17 ac 17 all stats, 12 all resists, 115hp, Regen 5.

They like to predend this is still a roleplaying game sometimes.   I guess
buff slots is too technical to say in conversation for them.

I've never had a problem with 15 actually, but then I can skip all the mana
related buffs.    20 sounds like a good compromise for allowing more classes
to use thier useful buff, while still maintaining a bit of tradeoffs in
determining which buffs you keep.

They want you to have choices and tradeoffs.   Not just buff with everything
...  "MGB kitchen sink inc!"

It's the way of the game.   Never just give the players something when you
can make them keep busy for an AA level or five to get it.

Been there, done that, got the t-shirt.

Hell, a druid once healed me from unconsious 3 times in a row.   We were in
the process of wiping on Velketor the Sorceror (he was pulled early back
when he was a raid mob) and they were chaining their 880 hp heal on me
(biggest they had at the time) while I tanked him so clerics could camp out.

You'd probably be suprised.   Since our guild has a grand total of 6
members, we tend to be very heavy on AA's, while light on raid gear. ; )

I'm sure theres at least some others in the same situation.
