When I explored MM and saw the pathing that I'd heard so much about,
my first thought was that it was deliberate.  Not necessarily done
deliberately from the start, but quite possibly deliberately left in.
Having mobs that run off and collect friends is just another form of
challenge in a dungeon.  As a programmer, I can imagine the elation
at being able to get that behavior without having to program the mobs
for it explicitly.
