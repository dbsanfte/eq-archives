I must've quit shortly before the "global upgrade"...cuz I remember I
bought the trilogy, and then SoL the next day...and still had the old
interface. 

No one was really aware of the new UI I think, or at least those
people I knew in RL that played...

Hehe..cuz of the spell book. Well, that and because I *loved* medding
with my nose in a book, blind as a bat...

But then I was a ranger too...so it was probably better I not see how
