I would imagine I need to run the quest 3 times as I had to with my
Ogre. I just started playing recently, so do not know anyone well enough
to ask, and don't really want to take up their time. A person on Drinal
patiently explained the process to me in tells, then left me to run the
quests on my own. I made a Vah Shir to hand in items as you mention,
then logged on my Ogre to finish the hand ins. It was sheer luck that I
ran into this person, and they suggested the quest when I mentioned I
enjoyed quests.

I agree, there really doesn't seem to be any easy way to do this. I'll
just enjoy the quests I can do for now. Also, I learned a bit of Froglok
last night! Skill level 46 now!
