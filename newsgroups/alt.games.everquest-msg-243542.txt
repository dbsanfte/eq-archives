I'm just imagining the situation of a guy camping Stormfeather just long
enough to get annoyed by it, when suddenly, yellow text, not unlike the text
that you get from those scavenger hunt NPCs whenever you run through a
starting city, scrolls across his screen:

"Hey dupe!  Bored and frustrated camping Stormfeather?  Well you're in luck!
For a modest fee of US $100 to Sony Online Entertainment, we will spawn
Stormfeather for you whenever you wish!  Think about it, with just a modest
fee, your camping woes can be over!  Don't waste any more time!  Act now!

Discover!"
