Well, it seems I now cannot move more than a few feet in PoK without
locking up my system requiring a total reboot. Played all afternoon and
evening with no problems, now the lockups. Obviously nothing has changed
in my system. Logged in to PoK, was just fine. A friend asked me to go
to Cobalt Scar and we popped over for an hour and on porting back, all
of a sudden I can no longer move in PoK. Like their earlier mob warping
at low health, this again shows all the symptoms of a severe memory leak
server side.

Has anyone come up with a workable solution to get chars out of PoK when
this happens?
