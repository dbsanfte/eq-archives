The attack rate slow is definitely still in.   I slow down noticibly until the
spell wears off.   It's only for 24 seconds though, so it's not a big deal
unless you're main tank on a raid against a major enemy.  (meaning, you must
keep aggro or the raid is toast)

He was the one talking about the bard healing, I wasn't paying attention to
that part of the conversation. ; )
