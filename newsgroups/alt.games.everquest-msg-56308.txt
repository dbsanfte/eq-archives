Well, yeah... If you want to drink ale, you should take care to get some
of it into your mouth, not just throw the tankard in the general direction
of your face. And their love of mining... Well, we need the metals, so I
should be thankful SOMEONE's doing it, but if they asked our tinkerers, I
bet they'd make a mechanical miner for them, leaving time for adventuring!

Signed, Bikbik or Cambus, I don't know which. Not signed Waspus, as he's
retired, poor guy...

Lokari's!

What's your high score? =D

Also, to the Original Poster: Keep us posted on your progress in EQ,
let us know what you started and where! And do start that Shadow
Knight when you feel you've gotten the hang of the game mechanics.
