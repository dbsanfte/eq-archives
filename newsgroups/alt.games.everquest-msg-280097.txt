At the levels you are talking about, 1-30ish, you can solo/duo with any 
combination of the above.  Shaman and Druid healing is a bit weak when 
you are getting close to getting your next heal spell, but otherwise, is 
close enough to cleric healing to not really be an issue.

My level 32, mildly twinked warrior still solos well when I feel like 
dragging him out.  Adding any of the healer classes to a reasonable tank 
class will let you duo in most places where you don't need a lot of crowd 
control.
