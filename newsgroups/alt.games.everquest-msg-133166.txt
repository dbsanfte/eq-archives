It's a technique where you set up your hotkeys to have the /bash
command and hotkeys with your secondary weapon slot and an inventory
slot where your shield is.  When you want to bash, you use your mouse
to switch the shield and your secondary weapon, then switch back when
you're done with the bash.  It's also known as "Ruatha bashing" named
after Ruatha, a gnome warrior who came up with the technique.  There's
an illustrated guide at:
