 Raul, get off it. My life is exactly the way I want it. Or as good as I
am willing to make it. What I do with my free time, whether it is 10 minutes
or 10 hours a day should NOT be of ANY concern to you.

 Good for you.

 How does quitting EQ put dolars into your bank account besides the $10
monthly charge? OOOoooohhhh... I make that every 6 minutes at work. Big 
deal!

 I'm fairly close to retirement. I've spent my entire life on activities 
"that will build a foundation for my future". The future is here. Mind if
I play a little EQ now please? Gee thanks. Now go away and quit telling me
what to do with MY life, take care of yours instead, ok?
