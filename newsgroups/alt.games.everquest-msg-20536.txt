The man wins a Kewpie doll :-).

First real dupe bug in the game involved some lamer with a really fast
computer and a really fast connection dropping 10 pp on the ground
and picking it up repeatedly before the server had time to register the
different "states" of the plat...on floor/inventory/floor/inventory...

Eventually it would be on the floor AND in the inventory...free 10 plat.
Rinse/repeat for unlimited cash.  Hence the "dropped money on the
ground on some weird trigger causing LD" bug.  Stupid, but effective.
Also the bane of anybody picking up  some other high level feller's
silver and gold.

Also, don't sit in a group and try to repeatedly split money.  If you
do it a certain number of times in rapid succession...LD.  Again,
same reason as before...split/split/split/split...all of the sudden,
everybody
in the group has ALL the money...Verant slap codes a fix.

Good luck in the future!
