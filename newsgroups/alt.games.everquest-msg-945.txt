1) 10th level skill, and you MUST have a piercer as primary weapon.
2) Yes, there is a button that will be available after you've hit 10th
3)  Stand behind mob (some allowance but not next to) and hit the button

4) Max. damage is *estimated* at being:
        ((WeaponDamage*2)+1) * (skill level/25)
    So, my weapon's damage is 9, I'm 24th level (BS skill 121)...
        ((9*2)+1) * (121/25) = (19 * 4.84) = 91.96.   My *real* best has
been 90.

5) Once you get it, a great opening to a fight is to sneak up behind, BS and
then hit attack.  ..plus add poison to that  :)

6) If you're soloing and cannot get behind it, you can use the BS key for an
*extra* frontal pierce.

7)  Fantastic resource for all things roguely is the message board at
www.thesafehouse.org
