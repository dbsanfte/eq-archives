Sigh. The main tank doesnt wield it. The tanks who arent buffed because
they dont have to be because the main tank is holding aggro do.

Suddenly your casters dont have to worry so much about keeping x
of those tanks clean of the AoE effects and can just concentrate
on keeping the main tank, secondary and tertiary tanks alive (yes,
we go with three buffed defensive warrios just in case ;) ) and
doing whatever offensive operations they've been tasked with.

*peers at Ben*

Are you just being bloody minded? ;)
