Not sure how that follows, I love monks in LDoN. If I'm filling out a
group a monk is usually the first class I'll try to get once the
basics are covered (rez, healer and main tank). They can pull, tank
and put out nice DPS, what's there not to like? Other class I'll often
look for is a ranger; snare, tracking, tanking and DPS.

Heh, sometimes it just doesn't work out as planned. We had a recent
group where I picked up a ranger and SK to fill out the group. We zone
in, start killing the first 2 mobs and I'm in tells with the SK about
how many he can pull at a time w/o feigning. The ranger just runs of
to pull before the last mob is dead. SK and I laugh about it in tells
and figure we'll give him a chance and see how well he does at it.
Ranger turned out to be one of the best pullers I've run across. 

... so much for pigeonholing <g>.
