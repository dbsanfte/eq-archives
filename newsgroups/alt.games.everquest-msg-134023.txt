No he's not right.   He's so wrong it gives the impression he didn't level
"his" cleric to 60 (or doesnt have 1)

As far as meleeing, weapons such as blackstar proc a group heal, as well as
doing nice mob damage.  Admittedly this is a very uber item (from nToV) but
there are many more examples.

Stuns - you get them for a reason. Its a clerics duty to prevent that
gating/chealing mob from getting his spell off.  (Its also the paladins and
enchanters duty.. doesn't matter if 3 people cast the same spell, just *make
sure* it gets interuppted)

Nukes - clerics can nuke for 1k+.. they have a very effective undead dot.  I
remember old PoH raids where on undead mobs, the cleric nuking meant the
difference between us getting exp or not.

Clerics also get Mark of Karn / MoR - reverse damage shields (1 heals
everybody meleeing the target, 1 does damage to the mob whoever it hits)

I've done Kael arena with 2 other people (a cleric, and monk, and my
monk+shaman).. kael arena is still a pretty tough place for a lot of people,
but with the cleric meleeing 80% of the time, we were still pulling all 3
prots, keeping the arena clear, and pulling the gladiators/named.    Yes the
cleric did have a NICE weapon (blackstar) but the point is still the same,
he didn't sit on his ass tossing a cheal to me every 5 mins, and an elix to
my shaman after each resisted slow.
