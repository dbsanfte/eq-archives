This makes a lot more sense from a coding point of view also.  I 
suspect it works something like this:  Basically, they treat each pet as 
an ungrouped PC by default.  If the group outdamages the pet, the group 
gets the EXP and it is split amoung the party members depending on their 
level.  If the pet goes wild and outdamages everyone else though, I 
suspect it triggers a subroutine which divvies the EXP up as if the pet 
were a group member, designates the appropriate amount of EXP to each 
character, and then applies the group bonus and class bonuses to the RAW 
EXP and then applies it to the characters.  I'm not sure if it awards exp 
to the pet or just dumps it, but the net result is the same.
The nice thing about this method is that it only has to trigger the 
subroutine if the kill is attributed to a pet.  In the vast majority of 
cases it treats a pet no differently than an ungrouped PC beating on your 
mob.
