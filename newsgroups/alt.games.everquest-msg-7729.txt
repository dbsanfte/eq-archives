My barbarian warrior has a full set of medium sized banded armor. Since 
she's 
pretty much retired, I thought I might give the armor to my DE cleric. But, 
my 
cleric isn't overly strong. I was wondering how much of a difference in 
weight 
(if any) there is between small & medium sized banded?

Thanks!
Anita
(finally narrowing down which chars I'm gonna concentrate on!)
