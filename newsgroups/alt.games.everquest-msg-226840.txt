What is it with you and posting bullshit misleading information all of the
sudden?

I don't know about on your server, but on E'ci, Recon did not break into
PoTime and suddenly "pharm" the entire zone.   It took them months to build
up to the point where they killed Quarm with their best equipped warrior
tanking.

Please show me where I suggested nerfing anyone.



....And yes, if enchanters ever became the preferred tank in experience
groups, as well as tanking the hardest mobs in the game, you're goddamn
right I'd be looking to nerf them.   Enchanters being the best main tanks
seems reasonable to you?
