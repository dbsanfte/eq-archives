There's also Griffons that are up to around level 37, and some quest mobs
that are 45+, although I think those might be triggered, so are not worth
worrying about...the chances someone would trigger them, botch the fight,
and train them to the canyon is pretty low.

The Griffons do fly at least partway into the canyon, though.
