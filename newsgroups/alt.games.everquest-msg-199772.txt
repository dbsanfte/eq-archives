You are mistaken.  The market _is_ free, which rewards assholes.
That is the nature of free (i.e. unregulated) markets.  You want a
"fair" market, but "fair" is in the eye of the beholder.  And you
can be certain that the assholes of this world see "fair" far
differently than you.

On Tunare where I used to play, steadily increasing competition,
plus the occasional drive-by MGB KEI in the Nexus, caused the
original "KEI for ##pp" (started at 100 when KEI was new) to
become "KEI for donations".  That is, the "for donations" was
part of the competition, which is part of why I think it's more
lame to bitch about "for donations" than it is for the KEI
sellers to be upset about crap donations.  Essentially, the
market has demanded "for donations" by punishing those who don't,
so it's pretty fucking bogus to bitch at the KEI whores for
doing as they have been required to do by their clients.
