In that case, start with tailoring.  It's the one most likely to 
dishearten you, so if it drives you nuts, you won't have spent lots of 
time on the others.  

And, that way when your disheartening wars off, you'll already have 
tailoring started a bit.  I did most of the others first, in the span of 
about a month.  Then the tailoring took me about 6 months... Not wrking 
full time on it or anything, but that's about proportinal degree of 
difficulty.  Near-infinite number of annoying green mobs to farm.

Hm, might be less of a pain now, though, that was pre-luclin.
