Actually a Fungi + a druid is better.
Also I PL'ed a warrior to 50 in 3 days played time with a druid and had all
skills maxed. (It was an Iksar warrior not sure if that matters at all).
Weapon skills did not start maxing until after 20, then I just switched
between weapons. I used the fastest weapons with no worry about damage for
obvious reasons. After level 30 or so the druid would cast drones from the
bracer. I never went OOM, never even close. A friend showed me ShowEQ and
with that it could have been faster most likely. (that should draw some
flames)
And no I did not sell the warrior :) - I did play both acounts however.
(That means, usually, that the druid did not go LD unless I was going LD).
