Are you stupid or just illiterate?  What part of the fucking Verant
naming convention can you not read?

Again, I will quote the applicable policy directly from Sony:

Note: Non-words like-- D, Da, De, Di, El, Z, Za, Ze, Zi, L, Le, La, Li
are unacceptable in cases where the name contains a normal word, as
they are references to "The" and implicate a title, in both cases
(e.g. D`Kval is acceptable and D`Basher is not).


There, in black and white, they have given an example where it is
allowed, so obviously you are once again incorrect.  Look, you're just
looking like an idiot, so I'm going to do you a favor, and provide a
link so you can check this next time.  Maybe you'll end up tasting
less shoeleather.
