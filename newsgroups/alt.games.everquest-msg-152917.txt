Or they figure you'll have friends.  This is one of the reasons they almost
never take action against people who share accounts.  If my guild were
raiding places that might drop parts of the Wizard epic, and I was going to
miss most of those raids because of real life, I'd make sure there was
someone there with my account info, so they could log me and CoH me in to
loot, if there were no other Wizards on the raid who needed the drop.
