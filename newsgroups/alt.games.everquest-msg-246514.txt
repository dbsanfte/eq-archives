1 month for $14.95
3 months for $41.85 ($13.95 per month)
6 months for $77.70 ($12.95 per month)
12 months for $143.40 ($11.95 per month)

That's after your first month.

It's a lot of fun.  The paradigm is different from EQ .. no real loot or
gear.  Unlike EQ (but like AO), you can do solo missions or group missions.
Or you can just run around town looking for bad guys to smack ... there's
plenty of 'em out there.  They spawn as you move, so no static spawns to
camp.

Heck, the hour or so I spent creating my character was worth the 5 buck
preorder so that I could beta. ;-)

As I think of it, a lot of the people I met during beta were disenfranchised
EQ players looking for something new to do.  That may also account for the
general lack of griefers and morons.
