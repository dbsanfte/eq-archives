That IS how you discover without any risk.  Here is an example of a
recipie I dont this is there.  Fish Head Soup.  You dont know if it is
in the game or not, maybe.  Or maybe you have heard rumors but noone
seems to have a recipe confirmation.  So you put Fresh Fish, Water and
spices, along with a Pot into a Spit or Oven and hit combine.  It isnt
a valid recipie it says (not sure what the new message is) and you
keep the items.  

OK, so that didnt work.  What if I add a jug of sauces instead of
spices.  Combine.  Nope, that didnt work.  OK, what about BOTH Spices
and Sauce.  Nope.  How about Fish, Water, Spices and Foraged Veggies
and the pot?  BINGO!!!!!

So what have you lost?  Just a little time to experiment, which I will
admit, is the way RL cooks try new recipies, and in RL, if something
doesnt come out right, you can add to it.  But as far as ingredients
you have lost nothing.

>and shouldn't there be some sort of drawback to experimenting a bad one
>(ie..loosing your components)?

Which was why it was such a challenge to find new recipes before.  And
not a bad thing mind you.   It made it more difficult, but that is
just the way it works.  Those using Blue Diamond and Jascynths (or
whatever they are called) that are paying ungodly amounts of plat for
them, can now experiment with low to no risk.  Something that is tough
to make yourself do when you wait 6 weeks to find someone auctioning 1
Blue Diamond for 6k.

I agree.  Wholeheartedly.  I never blamed Verant for making me push
the Combine button on a bag full of loot because I was full up and
even my 2 tradekits were filled.  It was all me.  Letting things go
into there was my decision.

>I thought
>there were enough bag / backpack / pouch containers in the game already.

Very true, although the Cured Silk idea was a great one and one I
think would be a perfect fit for the game, especially because I agree
that they let the Sewing Kit thing go too long and that Monks are
bearing the brunt of it.  Now that they have taken away a loophole
they were knowingly letting slide I dont disagree with fixing what
they just did with items to help those they hurt the most.  Besides,
we need more uses for Heady Kiolas=)
