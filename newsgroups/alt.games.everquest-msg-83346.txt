It seems that sometimes the corpse timer is just hosed.

I died in a duel in TD (accidentally, my sparring partner
was standing too far away to get timely updates on my
health, and didn't know it was time to stop nuking
in order to keep from killing me).

There were no Clerics handy, so it took us a while to
track one down (I was bound in Thurgadin).

When we finally got one two hours later, I had a full
hour left on my corpse timer.  But the Cleric got the
"corpse is too old" message...

I was online the entire time, so the "camp method"
was not an issue.

I /petitioned, and quickly got a Guide to respond,
and even he verified from his logs that even then I 
should *still* have had plenty of time left of my 
corpse timer.  Yet, even his own rez failed with a 
"too old" message.  So I just had him Summon me to 
my corpse to save the trip.

Strange.
