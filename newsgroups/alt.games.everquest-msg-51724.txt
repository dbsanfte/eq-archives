for standard class yes, clerics and chanter can start
26 30 FM fort
30 35 OT
35 40 CC if you have Velious expansion (good loots and xp dungeaon bonus)
40 44 SolB at rares room

The best xp ever ! grab a chanter and do chain train pulling + rares
i spent from 40 to 45 there with really good groupmates and we were able to
take rares, bats and even lava beetle at same time.
A GM came to see us, as they did when the kill/per hour is really higher
than usual. Hey, we r not cheating, we just rocks !
With a full group of 41 and 42 only, a EL group fled to the zone, our puller
managed to grab it back to rares hehe. I lost roll on GEBs but it was quite
fun.
SolB with cleric chanter melee is 1 lvl per 4 or 5 hours.

44 50 KC, EW rygorr fort (can be started a lvl 40 as healer)

44 is a great level. Get Celestial healing !!!
zero aggro when healing and not too much mana greedy.

50 55 Velkethor (mass xp at ledge, good loots, gem for thurg armor quest)
      Kael (bank, chanter house, etc ..)
      Sebilis

55+   Velketor (xp factory, really boring, but if you want xp, go there.
Overcamped tru)
      Every fon 55+ places
