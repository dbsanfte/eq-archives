It's not really that simple.

For one, F8 is hopelessly unreliable.  In some zones it mostly works,
in other zones you can forget about it.  It frequently either targets
the wrong mob or fails to find a target at all.

/assist is important, but that doesn't help your main tank, nor does it
help your crowd controllers who are trying to target mobs for mezz,
root, slow etc.
