He is one of the most difficult mob to kill in the game.  And not just
that mob itself but also other limitations like max raid size can
effectly handicap your guild's ability.  It takes a very well executed
plan, right balance of raid toons, and some bit of luck.

I am aware of only ONE guild who have bought him down and that's one
out of all guilds on all the servers.
