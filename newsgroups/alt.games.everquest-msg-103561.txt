Apparently so did about 50 other people ...

I've never managed to overflow the bandwidth limit on my gimp page
before....

I checked the bandwidth log and apparently the most I've ever gotten before
was like 240kb in a day, then today I got 70 MB in a day...  ookay, bye bye
to the 300k+ pics.

If the Chimp page manages to overflow... I'm gonna be fucking amazed.  (the
largest one is 2kb)
