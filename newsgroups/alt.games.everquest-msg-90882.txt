Actually, you can. Killing bixies, many enchanters will pay 5gold for each
honeycomb or more. And many higher level druids will pay you to collect
batwings for them (a reagent in their spells). You can make 2-3p  or more
for a stack of batwings. Same with Bone Chips, many Necromancers will pay
you for them. This may not seem like much, but it adds up and there is
really not any other way at your level to make more money.
