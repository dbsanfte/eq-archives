That is generally true. At most levels monks outdamage warriors by up to 
20%. At high levels, however, warriors equal monks in famage

Monks do more damage than rogues from the front, generally. Our special 
attack does more damage than frontstab

By another 20-30%. It's quite a bit. At high levels it can go up to 40%

Of course not. However, fighting ubermobs is only 5% of the game, or 
less. I tend to think that it's much less.

Until Cobalt and Velious armors, a decently equipped monk will have 
noticeable higher AC than a warrior. However, cobalt doesn't quite grow 
on trees for a casual gamer. And my monk is equipped for under about 40-
60k. I.e. the cost of my equipment is generally less than cost of a 
single decent cobalt piece

Yes, and it's a BIG difference too.

I'm yet to see any evidence of this. The main reason I think people say 
that monks get hit harder is because their hitpoints bar moves down 
twice faster than warriors. That is mainly due to the difference in 
overall hitpoints. I've parsed my logs and logs of a 52 warrior, I was 
taking about 30% less damage. Of course, I did have about 40 more AC

> 3) Warriors get taunt. 

The one and only time I missed taunt in experience groups was when I 
needed to break mez. Taunt goes a long way there.

Actually rangers get taunt as well. :)

I would throw in "lots of camping or lots of cash for your equipment"

Oh, lord! Can you imagine mend on a warrior? Whoa! Instant uninterrupted 
heal once every 6 minutes, that heals about 1k hitpoints at high levels
