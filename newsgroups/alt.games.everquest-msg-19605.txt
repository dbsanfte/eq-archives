Answer 1: How is playing the game not real life? I'm really am sitting in
front of my computer issuing commands to my avatar (not a UO reference). I
really am interacting with real live people from all over the world through
a medium only slightly advanced from sending words on paper back and forth
(electronic packets not paper, same concept). I am not imagining or dreaming
I'm playing a game, I actually am sitting there playing the game.

Answer 2: No I am not delusional and think I can incinerate things by waving
my hands in the air.

Answer 3: Sometimes it's fun to joke with another person at work that plays
EQ that the marketing types are KoS to the engineering types.
