Nope, kill them all and let Tunare/karana sort them out.
You can even kill the bears and wolves around qeynos hills, they have
no faction (just watch out for holly)

No animals hurt your faction as far as a ranger or druid except stuff
in surefall and the only other mobs that do are things in the Plane of
Growth.
