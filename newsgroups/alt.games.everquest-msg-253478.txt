Why do you say 'obviously' if you admit to having no idea why its down?

I dont pretend to know whats going on with it either, but it could just as
easily be a severe hardware malfunction that needs to be replaced, an
unexpected loss of communications at the building where that server's
network of computers run(resulting in the machines being moved to a new
location), or something else. given that only the one server is down, it
seems less likely a major exploit is being fixed.... or all servers would
have come down before the situation got out of hand. plus 12 hours(and being
told 12 hours upfront, no less) is quite a while for a server to be down for
a patch.
