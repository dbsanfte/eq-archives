Tanaan mastery isnt something id go for first, but I guess your into
tradeskills a lot.
Ive got most of the aa abilities, but heres some that I consider good
value...

Lightning reflexes 5. This will massively increase your survivability.
Eldritch rune 3. Again, a lifesaver. Combined with LR5 i can get away with
all sorts of silliness, where I would otherwise die.
Total domination 3. If you raid a lot and have to charm this is excellent
value for the cost.
Project illusion. Not necessary, but everyone wants to be a gnome... or so
it would seem.
MGB... this depends on what type of guild you are in. If your raids only
have 4 or 5 groups max then you probably better getting something else.
   note that with fully extended buffs, haste will still run out before MGB
recharges. You need 3 chanters for c5+VQ if youre gonna do it all with
mgb's.
