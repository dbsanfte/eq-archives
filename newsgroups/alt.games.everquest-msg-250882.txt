Not true.

They said they were fixing the session problems, NOT fully instancing it at
this point.

The problem is this:
Only 1 raid can be in PoTime (b) at any one time.  PoTime is broken into
timed phases.. 1hr for phase 1, 1hr for phase2, 1hr15 for phase 3, 4 hours
for phase 4 and so on..

Time not used in any phase is carried over to the next phase, so coming into
phase 4 you could have 5 hours on the timer.  Porting into phase 5 would add
4 more hours, so if the raid chose this point to camp for the night (lots
clear potime in 2 days).. for as many hours as were left in your script
(about 7), no other raid/guild could start a new instance.  So servers which
have multiple timezone people raiding potime in the same day would all be
affected by this problem.

There can still only be 1 guild/raid in PoTimeB at a time.

The fix means if an instance is empty, the script won't wait xxxx hours now
before ending..  I would guess 30 mins or an hour now at most
