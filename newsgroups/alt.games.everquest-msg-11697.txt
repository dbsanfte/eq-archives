Hey, you're not the only one.  :)  I've *tried* the fullscreen mode. 
Tried it several times.  Messed with text colors, windows, everything to
get it "right" ... and I just don't like it.  <shrug>

Of course, I've heard that the new EQ client (for Shadows of Luclin)
will be a fullscreen-like interface, that they'll be doing away with the
chatscreen mode (or whatever you wanna call it) entirely.

Hm.
