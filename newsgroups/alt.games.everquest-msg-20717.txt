Look at it this way:  when you mem up a spell you're medding.  Take your
time getting up between buffs.

Yup, my primary is an enchanter.  I always have clarity on myself, and I
always cast it on myself first.  Every group I'm in, even with friends they
say "clarity going."  Well, no shit.
Now that he's level 52 and has group clarity...and people SEE me casting it,
they STILL say "clarity going."  But do I scream?  No.  I scream enough at
people breaking my mezzes prematurely...I figure I'll let the buff reminder
thing go. :)  Besides, I still occasionally don't notice it gone until a
minute after it goes (so they tell me)...all I ask is that they wait 30
seconds after it's GONE (not blinking) before they nag...is that too much to
ask? :)

You will, don't worry about it.  Casters want HP,  tanks want everything,
and everyone wants (needs) SoW.

Don't bother with the resists until you KNOW what you need.  Honestly,
except for a few cases, I've never bothered with any of them (51 druid)
below level 46.  Magic resistance, however, is nice if you're up against a
caster.  But disease and poison just doesn't seem worth it.  Chances of
dying to either are pretty slim if you have a halfway decent healer in the
group, and resists to fire & cold just don't seem to lessen the total damage
much.

They do seem to have more than their share of mana. :)  But playing my
higher level enchanter (52) and having the ability to drain & steal mana
from critters I CAN verify that they don't have an unlimited supply...but it
sure does seem like it sometimes!
