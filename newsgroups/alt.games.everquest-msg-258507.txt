It could be useful even when soloing.  Just the other night, I was
soloing in Highhold Keep (amazingly, there was nobody else in the
basement?!) and for some reason Harmony didn't seem to be working
right, so I got some overpulls.  (And I couldn't run them over to
the guards, because the people who ARE in the Keep these days all
seem to be there to hunt the guards.)

On one particularly bad pull I managed to fire off my Crucible of
Escape (Lessor Succor) and got it to channel through, but just as
it fired off I went unconscious to a DoT, and the last couple ticks
of the DoT finished me off before my regen could pull me back.

Hm, can monks invoke Mend while unconscious?
