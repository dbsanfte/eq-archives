> The level of IMMERSION within EQ1 has been dropping sharply:

> * They made one big city, PoK, that everybody goes to so now the culture
> of the individual cities -- EQ1's biggest charm -- has become virtually
> worthless.  No characters truly start as warriors of Halas or paladins
> of Felwithe anymore -- they have been streamlined to start as slaves in
> their starting zone.  Players no longer identify themselves as "yes, I
