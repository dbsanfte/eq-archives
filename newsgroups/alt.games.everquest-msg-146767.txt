There is a widespread bug with the latest update.  Some kill disappear
without delay.  Or in some cases when NPC health gets very low it disappear
and reappear at start spot.  It was annoyance at first when these glitches
happened.  One time when I was farming at Goblin camp, one of the Goblin got
stock in a loop.  After his health gets low, he would run and vanish.  But I
was located in such a way so that when he reappeared seconds later at his
start spot and start to run my character automatically hits him.  He
continues to run, vanish, pop, I hit, run, vanish, pop and so on.  It was
amusing.  I just sat there looking at this loop.  It's like dejavu again and
again.

But this glitch almost cost me life today.  While on a corpse run to Oasis
from East FP, I ran in to Derv face to face as I came over the dune.  It
startled me and it took me a second to realize that he was very low on
health and stumbling around away from his attacker.  I saw two NPC sitting
nearby in the direction of Derv camp facing at us.  They were camping and
this Derv is there kill.  Since if he dies now they will get the experience
and the loot anyway, so on a whim I decided to practice my hand-to-hand
combat skills on this Derv.  I started to punch, but as soon as I did that
he vanished before my eyes!  I looked around quickly but he was gone.  As I
looked towards Derv camp I saw all three Dervs starting to run at me!?.  I
thought the two NPC by the camp pulled them.  Because when this happened I
was quite far away from the Derv camp (almost at the end of my visual
range).  So I just stood there looking anxiously at this train rushing
towards me.  I am on a corpse run and I am totally naked.  Three Dervs are
all dark blue to me.  My anxiety turned to panic when all Dervs ran right
over the waiting NPC like they weren't there!  They were all after me!  But
why!  But how!

After a mad dash to the zone, I realized the Derv I punched must have poped
back at the camp and trained other two Dervs at me!  So much for the fun
with dejavu.

Emilio.
