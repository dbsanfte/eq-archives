At that point, the pilot himself becomes a need for the other two, perhaps
even more so than the medical attention.  Because they need him, they are
forced to defer their need for medical attention for his sake.

Which is where my "if" statement is essential.  To need something and work
your tail off for it isn't greed.  To need something and expect others to
give it to you is.  Your intial statement was not sufficiently complete to
make a judgment, so I had to qualify my response to it.
