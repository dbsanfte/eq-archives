Admittedly I probably prefer a more immersive experience than the next 
person. Long trips on foot just happen to be the negative side of this 
type of atmosphere. Since we don't experience the same degree of positive 
immersion, I tend to avoid the negative immersion by using the port books 
and such.

Well, it makes sense in my head anyway.  :)
