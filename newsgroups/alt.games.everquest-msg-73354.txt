A level based damage bonus I believe, that will go up as you level further.
Being as my warrior is only 23, I can't state this from personal experience.

On a completely unrelated topic, this damned piece of crap OE has decided
that my signature is no longer to be appended to messages.  I double checked
the settings, it is my default signature, it is set to append this signature
to all messages on this account.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  OK,
any suggestions on how to make OE append the signature would be appreciated.
I have to now tell OE to insert my signature manually on each message.
