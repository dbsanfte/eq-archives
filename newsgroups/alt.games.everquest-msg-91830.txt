Let me first say I by no means actually know what I am talking about. So
feel free to close this post if you dislike a newbie putting input into high
end game.

After reading several posts about the "High End" zones it would seem better
if Verant would "redue" the monsters for 55+ zones.

By redue I mean, the difficulty level. Some people seem to have a harder
time killing that mob getting crappy stuff then killing ThisMob and getting
better stuff. Seems a bit odd to me but I would have to actually get become
over level 56 to get a good understanding of the high-end zones and
monsters.
