Wow, your post just scored a 10 on the MORON METER.

Let's see, they added Kunark which is more land area than the original, 
then also added Velious, Planes of Power, Stonebrunt, Paineel, Legacy of 
the Ykesha. It's *AT LEAST* 3x as big as it was originally, and probably 
more like 5x, but I'm sure you can find out by looking through all the PR 
on their web site.
