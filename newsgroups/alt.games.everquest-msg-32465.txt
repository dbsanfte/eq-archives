You're absolutely right.

This is why when I run I always know where I am going and why. I can kite a 
mob away from the main group, DoT it, and root it. It's out of commision for a bit, and I can go back to other 
important things long enough for the prime target to be smooshed. Running can be 
effective crowd control, and is much better than staying put while a tank 
ignores your plight.
