Not just Luclin zones. Velious and the Legacy of Yeska zones are also
places where old world factions don't mean diddly.  

Even the Kunark zones are pretty easy faction-wise; A character is
going to be accepted in either Firona Vie, Overthere, or Cabilis. Some
characters may be accepted at both FV and OT. Bind in whichever area
accepts you.  Many of the higher level spells for a caster are
available only in FV or Overthere. 

Once in the 50's PoP zones begin opening up, but one can use the PoP
books to travel long before then if one needs to go home for training
or spell purchases. 

Once you have a high enough level to slaughter 100's of level one mobs
per hour, gaining faction can become trivial. It's the factions that
require questing that are difficult.
