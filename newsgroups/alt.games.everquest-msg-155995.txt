I was thinking of starting a necro character but am debating whether to 
go for erudite or gnome wizard
I like the idea of a gnome wiz because of the extra dexterity and 
agility which on the occasions where my pet dies and i end up getting 
hit on i can avoid the blows better
The extra int of an erudite doesnt seem such a big deal as there are so 
many +int items in the game
Just wondered what other peoples thoughts were for a choice for 
Necromancer?
