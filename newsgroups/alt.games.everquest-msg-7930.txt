Not entirely true, it can be done.

If the server you are on has split you can opt to have your account moved to
the new server.
It had also, apparently, been done in extreme in the past. I'd heard that
requests to verant etc had got an account moved but there was harassment
involved and it was the innocent party that was moved. Of course this may be
a Myth and even if not I believe that Verant no longer do it at all (except
in fore mentioned splits) I spoke to a guy who wanted to trade equipment on
BB for Equipment on another server, was willing to take a loss on this to
get off of BB, apparently his Ex-wife played on BB and she could tell when
he was home by whether he was on EQ. GM's weren't willing to help.

What cannot be done, in anyway shape or form is moving a single character,
anywhere, it has to be an account.
