I agree, I am a Paladin and I think Faerie's are cool (particularly because
I would like to get their Cavalier Lance).  But now they are gone :-( (can't
get the lance now - just found out how to do the quest too :-( ), although
the good side to this is the sprites now drop fairy dust, so my conscience
will no longer bug me if I get this stuff.  But I do hope they put the
faerie's back as I really want to do this quest, plus it is really quite
peaceful sitting in their village hearing them jingle (call me soft, but
every Paladin needs their time of meditation to be focused on the holy).  I
would rather pay a couple of hundred plat for the dust and have the faeries
than pay nothing and have the sprites (or even better, have a great GM war
between the Faeries and the Sprites and they both end up with their own
little corners!).  Rain Caller quest I hear is broken too with Faerie's
gone.
