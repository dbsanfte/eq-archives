I was waiting at a bus stop last week and the monitor with the
incoming/outgoing info on it flickered and showed the original blue screen
of death of the C64's.

I let out an involuntary shudder before I could stop myself......back in
those days I was a kid and could only afford a tape drive on my after school
job, I lost count of how many times I would half an hour to 40 minutes for a
stupid audio cassette to deliver it's precious 64kb payload only to result
in a blue screen 60% percent of the time.

I eventually figured out that rewinding the tape, fast forwarding, then
rewinding again whilst laying the tape drive at about 5 degrees off
perpendicular on it's side before use would alleviate the tracking problems
and lower the failure rate to about 20%.

When I got my first full time job I splurged on a Amiga with it's fancy
built in FDD - such luxury. Ahh, the bad old days.....don't miss them one
little bit. : )
