This makes sense from a "real world" level, too, I know several people 
named Lance, I know a -lot- of people named John... unique first names 
is actually a bit weird, come to think of it.

This would help, although if you have a list you can just pick the right 
one off the list.  But being able to set up a nickname of your own for 
each person would be great: You could call Robert Mucha "Bob", Robert 
Engleman "Rob" and Robert Silverado "Jerk"... thats the way it works 
IRL, after all.

Another option, for when you don't have a macro set up, would be for the 
game to resolve ambiguities by picking the last person you talked to off 
the list of possibilities.

That way, if you talked recently to Robert Mucha, then sending a tell to 
R would get him, unless you even more recently talked to Ralph Loren. 
THen, to get "Bob" you'd have to tell Ro.

That might take too much memory, though, game keeping track of everyone 
I ever spoke too?  So limit it to 20 or 50 names, negligible amount of 
memory.
