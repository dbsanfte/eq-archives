No.

XP is a fixed number. A human and a halfling at 50th level have the same 
amount of XP. And when a mob dies it is worth a fixed amount of XP.

It only gets munged in when xp is actually added... if a human and a 
halfling both have x XP and each kill a mob worth y then the human is 
given y*rb xp, and the halfling is given y*rb xp. And then the new xp 
value is saved to the character.

for humans rb is 1, for halflings its 1.05.

If they reverse rb tomorrow no existing character will be affected in 
the least. Except that on the next kill humans would benefit a little 
more than halflings would.

This is a simple change and safe to do.

The situation you are referring to however did occur, where peoples 
'current' progress was 'apparently' adjusted as result of a game tweak, 
  it wasn't when they altered the bonues, but rather when they smoothed 
out the 'hell levels'.

Before the patch X amount of absolute xp meant you were just into 
40th... but after the patch it could mean you were halfway through 
39th... and they may have given out som free xp to prop people up who 
would have seen an 'apparent' downward shift... i don't actually recall 
anymore.
