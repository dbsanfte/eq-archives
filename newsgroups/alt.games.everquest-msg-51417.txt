Personally, I never even use the roots anymore....  Yeah, it was great to be
able to root a mob, and blast it... but DD spells tend to break root...  So
now, I use my handy-dandy snare spell to slow them down, run with SoW, and
stop, nuke, run, stop, nuke, etc...  Once they get to the point where
they're low on health, and trying to run away, I close in and melee...  Very
effective for me... :)
