Stop with this crapy bracelet, join a rares group in SolB and stay tere from
40 up to 47.
You will win rolls on tons Runed Mithril Bracers droped from King.
I won 7 RMB from 40 up to 46. I lost roll once on Gebs. (Btw a skilled full
group of 40 and 41 can kill Effreti Lord at ease)

RMB is 5wis 3str 5ac and is not LORE so you can equip two and sell the rest
or give to low level guildmates.

Follow my advice, run to SolB now !
