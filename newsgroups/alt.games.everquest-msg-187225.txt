Einstein suggests that there are never "same conditions".  I offered proof
of that.  Is it any wonder that I am patronizing when you say:

"safefall always works the same no matter what"
"but what about lag?"
"other than that"
"but what about different video cards"
"other than that"
"but what about if you lower the clipping plane"
"other than that"
"but what about if you look straight up"
"other than that"
"but what about if you look straight down"
"other than that"
"but what about if you spin while you fall"
"other than that"
"but what if someone with all kinds of particle effects walks in front of
you while you're falling"
"other than that"
"but what if the local zerg guild of 100 zones in right then"
"other than that"

Etc., etc., and etc.  Your statement was wrong, those "same conditions" may
in fact be a rarity, and to be technical, they are in fact an impossibility. 
But for me to argue to that extreme would be to "pull a DT".  :p
