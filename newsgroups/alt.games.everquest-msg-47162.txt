I can hardly speak from long experience, but I did go visit the warrens like
you are now, trying something new.  I found it a bit like Befallen or UGuk;
full of green but still aggro or fenzy mobs, and when I did get to a blues
area there were always several.  Also, lots of wanderers, so even when I
did manage to find a single spawn I still got adds.  All in all, not a fun spot
to solo in.  As it was pretty much empty, I had no luck getting a group
(not that its easy to get a group as a necro anyway)

The trivial loot code is indeed in place, but that doesn't prevent you
from getting the most valuable "drop" in the place, which is good faction
with both paineel and erud erudites.  If you want to be able to bank
in paineel while you hunt in the hole, take your high level character
into the warrens and kill everything that moves.  As a 54 wizard, you'd
be looking at one shot four kills, not too shabby.

I'd say he was on his way to Stonebrunt, but that zone is -also- TLC,
and killing stuff for faction is less trivial there, so why bother?
