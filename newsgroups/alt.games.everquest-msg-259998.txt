They've got a battleground now for every five levels in the game, until 
level 45 then it's the Frontier only.  And every battleground is 
different, which is just great.  I find the bg's at level 14 etc. far 
more fun than the Frontier with my 50 ranger or 48 Menty.  No super-
duper-uberness, lots of mistakes, just a kind of crazyness that makes the 
experience refreshing.  And with high levels in place, I could care less 
about realm points, etc., I just play to have fun, do suicide runs, etc.  
If they had put all this current stuff in the initial release (especially 
the low level battlegrounds!) I bet it would have given EQ a run for the 
top dog.  But many have moved on now, and it has lost it's dazzle.  Pity.  
They did a lot of stuff right, 'cept for maybe the pve area that though 
lacking, was obviously made just to level up for realm fighting.
