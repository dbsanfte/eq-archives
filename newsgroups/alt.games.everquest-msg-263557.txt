Hey gang,

I'm not sure what the rules are concerning what I am about to ask, but I 
figured its better to ask permission than forgiveness.  Or is it the other 
way around?

Anyway, like I mentioned earlier, my wife and many of my friends have played 
EQ II since friends and family.  My wife has very nice writeup, that 
everyone seems to just love on a forum she frequents for druids.  Would it 
be ok for me to post the url here for the forum?  It has already had 1200 
viewings and it has only been up for a day and a half.

I think you will like it, she is very concise and very fair.  She is not 
like me where the staccato of machine gun fire comes blazing from my 
somewhat pummeled keyboard.

Let me know...

Thanx....

Dick....
