You may be on a quiet server or you're not in any guild.  If I wanted
faction in Dranik, I just drop a hint in my guild alliance channel and
within 10 minues I'd have a full group.  Notice I said alliance, the
11 or 12 guilds by themselves can't raid anything higher than tier 1
planes but with the alliance channel, all the guilds can get together
and easily mop NToV with low casualities.  Guild merger could be done
but guild management window has problem displaying more than 10,000
(this can be confirmed and yes there are guild with over 10K members)
