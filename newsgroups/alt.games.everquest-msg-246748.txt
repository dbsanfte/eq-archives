Oops meant expansion.

SOE have stated they will phase in their implementation on the new
engine (more changes with each expansion).

This article refers (para 3)

http://tinyurl.com/2b7ts

I do love the bit where he talks about DX9 compliant 16MB graphics
cards though.  Do not know of any such beasts and may explain why SOE
are having big graphics probs atm with EQ.  As I have stated before the
only DX9 capable cards atm are Radeons and none of them come in 16MB
flavours,

Note he also refers to their stupid idea to offer deals on Nvidia cards
which cannot do DX9 properly.. sigh.
