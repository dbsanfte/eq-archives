Went there last week and thought is was a cool place.  Dangerous but cool
and had a real NEW feeling about it.  I look forward to zones like this in
the up and coming Lost Dungeons expansion.  The best I can figure is there
are two factions in this place.  The Gnolls(I think they are gnolls) and
goblins.  Kill gnolls will raise faction with Goblins and kill goblins
rasies Gnoll faction.  Easy enough.  I am unclear about whcih one you should
hunt.  We found a Gnoll giving out quests so decided to quit kill gnolls and
started to hunt Goblins.  I would say that your group needs to be mid 50s
and higher to come here.  Also, make sure you are at full HPs before going
lava swimming.  Once you zone into SOL C the lava hurts A LOT more.
Finally, the zone out is not the same as the zone in.  So be prepared to
need a port or have your own means to gate out.  Zone in spot is safe unless
you get trained.  And as sated earlier, if you get trained at entrance there
is no place to run to.
