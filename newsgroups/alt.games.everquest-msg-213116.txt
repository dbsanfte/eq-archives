The sad thing is that I *resisted* the Clinging Darkness spell, only to 
fail feign death.  :)  But... yeah, now that you mention it, I've heard 
the same thing, just as a DOT will cause a successful feign to stop 
working as well.  Little things that make the mob go, "Hey, hoss, you're 
not really dead, are ya? <THWACK>"

There's nothing quite like the thrill, though, of being ganged on by 
four or five mobs, hit feign within an inch of death, and then watch 
them just... stop.  And stand there for a bit.  And then, slowly, one by 
one, wander off.

Bliss.
