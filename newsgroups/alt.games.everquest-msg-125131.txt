When I'm running for the zone, assuming I am not SoWed, I do not watch which
way the mobs go to follow me, I strafe run to the zone, and zone out.  If
the mob got hung up somewhere on the way, I would never know it.
Regardless, a mob getting hung up on a tree or rock is not the same as a
weird pathing bug where the mob runs in the wrong direction in it's attempts
to get to you.
