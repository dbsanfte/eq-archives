I think its sad for someone to even cheat in a single player game. (but 
at least its not hurting anyone)

But why is cheating in pve sad?

Because there is still a myriad of 'competition' going on...

The bazaar is a competition, where the prices of goods go for whatever 
the most anybody will pay for them... guess what the prices go up if a 
lot of people are 'cheating' to get extra funds.

The selling market (as well as coveted drops) is also a competition, as 
bots can monopolize spawns 24x7. Sure a 'gang of teens' can do that too, 
but think about the relative effort... one idle P4 is pretty easy to 
come up with ... 4 or 5 teen-agers who won't get bored sitting in one 
place in shifts for a solid year isn't nearly so common... possible 
yes... common... NO.

The ability to join groups is a competition. If every other warrior is 
cheating to get extra funds and xp they will have more AA and better 
gear than you, and get picked for groups whenever they are actually 
playing over you.

Sure there will always be disparity based on how much play time you 
have, but people can accept that. They are less willing to accept that 
someone who only plays 6 hours a week has millions of plat, and hundreds 
more AA and is getting invited to groups over you simply BECAUSE he 
CHEATS.
