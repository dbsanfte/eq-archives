Just so you know...  Clerics and Chanters have something in common.  They
taunt like hell with their spells.  When a Cleric runs out of mana, he
can't heal.  A cleric, at a higher level, can't melee worth shit...  I
should know... My cleric has tried.  My higher level druid which suffers
the same weapon leveling as my Cleric, relies heavily on dots, nukes and
Damage shields, it is funny as hell why I even bother carrying a weapon
with me.

Reason why a cleric is easy to find groups in some areas - The need for a
healer.  An Enchanter can only charm and/or mez mobs for so long,
especially in a dungeon.  A healer, however, helps keeps the groups ready
to go for the next round, especially the melee and hard nuking casters.
While the other classes are great, I don't want to go into the Crushbone
Throne Room with just a tank and caster with my low level enchanter, I am
going in with a full blown healer so we can stay in the throne room.  When
a cleric bails because he has no mana, it is pretty good reason to if your
group is low on health and there is a lot of mobs.  In your case, An
Enchanter and a Cleric, if you two are fighting some serious mobs, I think
you guys need to rethink your group and get a tank or two.  As an
enchanter, you might not get your Mez or Charm spell off while it beats the
crap out of you, and your charm spell isn't always convient on when it
drops, nor does the mez spell hold the mobs reasonably long enough for you
to med to  work it down or get up another animation in time to save your
ass, nor allow the cleric to join in on the fight, where his primary
mission is to keep both of you alive.

One last thing.  A Cleric is NOT a Druid.  They can't evac you out of hell.
If they have enough mana to gate or divine Aura...  They will gate, cause
unless they can run to the zone in 18 seconds, and hope that you guys will
get the hell out of dodge, a Cleric's only option to get out is to gate.
Divine Aura prevents the cleric to do anything BUT run.  They can't cast or
fight back while it is up, but a mob does have the possible chance of
stunning the cleric, costing him time in order to get out.

Fighting to the death...  Well, only good if you are in a raid...  With
high level clerics who will still be there when the fighting is done and
that can rez you.  Because there, you don't have to fight your way back to
get to your body and get your stuff back.  If you think it sucks to die
because the cleric bailed...  Think how much more it will suck for you to
try and make your way back down to where you were with no support and no
gear and in a zone where they can see through your illusions.  Then you
will regret you didn't do what the cleric did to, which was get the hell
out of dodge with him.
