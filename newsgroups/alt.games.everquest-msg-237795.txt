First of all, since surprisingly noone has taken the time to point
this out yet, we don't top-post in this NG. There is some runaway
thread going on here about this right now if you want to know why.

Anyways, I think you are completely wrong when you say "You don't
undertand." I think several people here understand very well. That
doesn't make your or her actions moral or ethical. And there is some
substance to the debate on whether that really matters.

Personally I wouldn't have gone so far as to use actual names, nor
contact her husband. And I think that is where this whole "expirience"
is starting to turn to the dark side (yeah yeah, cheesy phrase,
couldn't think of anything better).

But seriously, there is a point where all these virtual experiences
become real in your life. You somewhat contradicted yourself a few
times here, saying it was all online and you would never do this IRL.
But then, you did send those emails, you did make this post, you did
get angry, you did experience a variety of strong emotions and quite
possibly because of this involvment did not seek or even avoided other
possible real life encounters. That's where this is bad for you.

I know the idea of going to a shrink may seem weird or come with the
implication that there is a problem... but (at least to me) it seems
to me there is. And I think that is with yourself. I'm not saying what
she did was ok, but I'm saying she'll move on and be fine and be her
own person. You're still stuck on this virtual relationship after over
a year! Really, you need to move on. I'm no psychologist, but there is
something that keeps you attached to the issue and I have a feeling it
is related to something in your own life that you really need to
discuss and explore with a professional. There's something lurking in
your mind and it wants to come out. Go find it and face it head on.

Good luck to you man.
