Please read the FAQ.  The FAQ ideally will keep you from introducing 
yourself with an annoying question.  Questions should be posted only 
when the FAQ, game manuals, or related web sites do not contain the 
information you need or are unclear.
Read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in the EverQuest program 
directory/folder on your computer. Special note all versions of EQ have 
a 'printable' copy of the eqmanual_supplement.doc. But still there's 
lots of good information in it.


New/Updated Material:
Updated Newsgroup Posting Title to always be: "FAQ xx/xx/xx" with the
x's being
replaced by the numbers of the current date. This
FAQ will be posted once month unless there is a large change that has 
occurred.

-----------------------------------------
1.    General questions

1.1   Q: What is the FAQ for?

A: This FAQ is designed for a newcomer to the game and/or this 
newsgroup.  It attempts to answer some basic questions about the game,
but owing
to 
the complexity and depth of Everquest, it is not possible to answer all 
queries.  If you have a question that requires some more specific detail 
there is a list of URL's at the end of this document that you might like
to
visit.

1.2    I see something in the FAQ that I think is wrong.  What should I
do?

A:  The current keeper of the FAQ is Annie Benson-Lennaman.  Her main is
Teapray
on Firiona Vie, and she is often is the chat channel
serverwide.age:age.  If you
see a mistake, flame her within an inch of her miserable lif... I mean,
please
let me know what is wrong and why, and I will update the FAQ if I
agree.  The
easiest way to do this is to simply respond to a thread where the FAQ is
posted,
and state your case.  If I happen to miss your suggestion (as may
happen, I
don't always read every post in the group) then keep at it, or contact
me in
game.  Note, if I feel that I am being harassed unduly, I will not
hesitate to
use my ignore list/kill filter.

1.3    Q: What is the newsgroup for?

A: For the discussion of all things related to the game of Everquest.


2.    Questions about Everquest

2.1    Q: What is Everquest?

2.3    Q: What are these expansions I keep hearing about?

A: There have been seven expansion packs to EverQuest so far: Ruins of
Kunark,
Scars of Velious, Shadows of Luclin, Planes of Power, Legends of Ykesha,
Lost
Dungeons of Norrath, and Gates of Discord.

2.4    Q: What is the Ruins of Kunark?

A: Commonly called Kunark, The Ruins of Kunark was the first EverQuest
expansion
to be released.   
This expansion included a new continent with many new zones to adventure 
in, lots of new dungeons, items, mobs, quests and spells, and also 
included a new playable race of characters, the Iksar lizard-men.  
People with this expansion also were allowed to advance beyond level 50 
(up to level 60,) which was previously impossible.

2.5    Q: What is the Scars of Velious?

A:  Commonly called Velious, The Scars of Velious is an expansion
similar to the
Ruins of Kunark, 
including another new continent with new zones, dungeons, items, mobs, 
quests, spells, level 60 cap, etc. but it is geared towards higher level 
players (level 30+) and does not include a new playable race.  

2.6   Q: What is the Shadows of Luclin?

A:   Commonly called SoL, this expansion adds Nexus spires to somewhat
facilitate transportation, The Bazaar, a 
place to trade items with other players, and new, more detailed player 
models.  Also added more hunting areas for all levels, four city zones, 
the beastlord class, and a new playable race, the Vah Shir. 

2.7    Q: What is Planes of Power?

A:  Commonly called PoP, this expansion raises the level cap to 65,
greatly
expands the Alternate Advancement 
options available, adds ability to form raids of up to 72 people, and
adds 
a very efficient transportation system, with direct teleportation to
most 
major cities.  Provides additional hunting grounds for levels 46 and up.

2.8    Q: What is Legends of Ykesha?

A:  Commonly called LoY, this expansion adds expanded bank space,
in-game maps,
armor dyes for all slots that show a graphic, the story window, a log
journal,
Frogloks as a playable race, and a few new hunting zones for level 40
and up.

2.9    Q: What is the Lost Dungeons of Norrath?

A:  Commonly called LDoN, this expansion provides instanced dungeons. 
An
instanced dungeons can only be accessed by the group that activated it. 
To
active a dungeon, a group must have at least 3 members, and the range of
levels
within the group must be 7 levels.  For example, a group that had a 20th
level
member and a 27th level member could get a dungeon, but they could not
add
anyone who was 19 or under or 28 or over.  The dungeons have missions
that must
be completed within 90 minutes, or 120 minutes for a lesser prize.  A
win will
result in each member being granted a number of Adventure Points that
can be
spent in the Wayfarer camps.  Also, the LDoN dungeon drop Augmentations,
which
can be used to add stats or abilities to armor and weapons.  

2.10    Q: What is Gates of Discord?

A: Commonly called GoD, this expansion adds a large tradeskill
orientated
boat/city zone, a tribute system where one can trade plat or items for
buffs
from NPC in the player's home city, as well as normal and instanced
zones that
intended for players who are leveled 50+.

2.11    What is EQ Macros and where can I get it?

A: EQMacros is a program which is no longer available. The purpose of 
this program was to provide a means whereby users could circumvent some 
of the more tedious aspects of the game. It also dispensed with some of 
the disadvantages certain characters had, such as night blindness.
Verant has required that the author of EQMacros cease distribution, and 
has stated that anyone caught using it will have their account banned.
This is a controversial subject in this newsgroup, and has been argued 
to death. Posting questions on this subject is generally frowned upon. 
Further information can be found at www.xylobot.com

2.12   Where are the Everquest servers located?

A: The entire EverQuest universe (at present, 50 separate worlds) 
is run on approximately 1,000 servers. These are located in an onsite 
datacenter and at AT&T CERFnet (in San Diego).  The Antonius 
Bayle server is located in the UK.  Kane Bayle, Venril Sathir, Kael
Drakkel,
Sebilis servers are located in Europe.

2.13   What are the special servers all about?

A:  The special servers include Everquest Legends, Test, the Zeks, and
Firiona
Vie.  These servers have different ruleset or conditions that change the
gaming
experience to varying degrees from the regular servers.  In general, all
the
special servers have lower server populations.  Except for Legends, they
all
cost the same to play on as the regular servers.  

2.13a  What is Everquest Legends?

A: Everquest Legends refers to the Stormhammer server a premium service
server
which costs $40.00 US a month to play on.  Some of the features of this
server
include Character Pages, which are personal homepages featuring all the
character's statistics and items. Also included is a personal journal,
Legendary
Items, Interactive Maps, Guild Halls: a website for Guild's needs
including a
guild calendar, message board, member roster, and pages to post guild
news, the
guild history, and increased dynamic content and customer service driven
by a
great presence of GM and support staff.

2.13b  What is Test Server?

A: This server is designed to be a place where the developers can see
how new
changes to the game will work when regular players interact with them. 
Test
players often get to see new developments to EQ before people on
production
servers do (if the changes get implemented at all).  They also play on
the most
unstable server available.  Test server frequently is taken off line,
with and
without warning, and small rollbacks where minutes or hours of gameplay
can be
set back.  Also there is a chance that SOE might elect to do a total
character
or equipment wipe.  There has never been a character wipe to date, and
there was
one total equipment wipe.  To access Test server you must go into your
Everquest
folder and run the application TestEverQuest.


2.13c  What are the Zek Servers?

A: These are the servers in which all players are subject to Player
versus
Player (PvP) gameplay as well as the Player versus Environment
gameplay.  The
server names are Sullon Zek, Rallos Zek, Tallon Zek, and Vallon Zek. 
Many
people love the PvP experience, while others hate it and consider the
inhabitants of the Zeks to be among the worst of griefers that EQ has to
offer. 
While it is up to the new player to decide their feelings on this
matter, many
would consider it a good idea for true new EQ players to get a handle on
the PvE
aspects of the game before also having to deal with the added challenges
that
PvP presents. 

2.13d  What is Firiona Vie Server?

A: Firiona Vie a roleplaying preferred server.  This server has several
special
rules including only one character per account (if you see people who
say they
have more than on character on this server this means they have more
than one
account), Trivial Loot Code (TLC) where if a MoB is green to anyone in
the party
that killed it then any loot tagged Lore or Magic will disappear (poof),
a lack
of No Drop items that extents to nearly everything in game save for
certain high
end keys, Grandmaster Trophies (but not all of them) and Epic and Epic
drops,
and a lack of Common Tongue (each race starts with their own racial
language,
and Common is replaced with Human).  The old rules about alignment
grouping
restrictions and language learning have been lifted.  SOE doesn't
enforce any
roleplaying rules, though several members of the server do with varying
degrees
of commitment.

2.14     Q: What is the newest server?

A: The last server added was the Morden Rasp server added on Feb. 24,
2004. 
This server allowed transfers from other servers from other servers from
the
very start, so never really had a "virgin" economy.  The last server
added that
did not allow transfers is Stromm, added on May 6, 2003.  While this
server's
economy was not "contaminated" by an influx of transfers, it has had
enough time
to be considered mature.

2.15   Systems Questions

2.15a   Q: How can I increase my frame rate?
Add this to your EQCLIENT.INI under the default section:
UseTnL=False
VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16

Note: This may not help all systems. Use at your own discretion.

Other things you can try:

In game under options (Alt-O pop-up window) choose lower settings
for spell and environment particles.

Also turn off Luclin character Models. This is done from the main
start up menu in EQ under options. This helps in raid situations where
lots of characters are around.

Also the /shownames command has several different levels to hide/show
names like titles, last names and guild names. This also helps frame
rate
in raid situations. Some like /shownames 1 to just show the first names
of
characters. Just type /shownames alone to see a help list of the levels.


3.    Questions about gameplay


3.1    Q: What is the best race/class combo to play

A: To answer this question you have to ask yourself what is important to 
you. If you're familiar with other RPGs and games of this nature, you 
probably know that each character will have his or her strengths and 
weaknesses, and that no single class/race combo will give you all the 
good with none of the bad.  The question to ask is not what is the best 
race/class combo is the best, but to ask which is best for YOU.  The 
best way to answer this question is to learn about all of the classes 
and races, and make your decision based on that knowledge.

3.2    Q: Is there any way for me to change the deity I worship, or to 
become Agnostic?

A: No, sorry.  The only way you can "change" your deity is to delete 
your character and start over.

3.3   Q: What are the Priest of Discord for?/Can I become a PK on
regular
servers?

A:  The Priests of Discord (PoD) will hand out a Tome of Discord if you
talk to
them and follow their prompts.  If you return the Tome to them, you will
become
a Player Killer and your name will now show in red.   Becoming a player
killer
has grave consequences that you may not be 
completely understanding of by reading the tome.  A player killer can 
engage in combat with other player killers, but cannot kill or be killed
by
non-player 
killers (with the exception of in a duel.) Also, and more importantly, 
if you are a player killer, you will NOT be able to receive most forms 
of aid from other players, nor will you be able to aid them.  This means 
that you cannot be healed or "buffed" by anybody who is not a player 
killer.  Since more than 99% of the players on normal servers are not 
player killers this totally ruins your ability to get in a group beyond 
level 15 or so.  If you want to be a player killer, play on a PvP 
server.  If you do turn in a Tome and change your mind, there is no
guarantee
that you will be able to change back to normal status, so only do it if
you are
certain that you want your character to live a solitary life.

3.4    Q: I want to transfer one character from one EverQuest account I 
have to another.  Can I do this, and if so, how? 

A: Yes, you can, but it will cost you. You can also move your character
to a different server, though not all servers can be transferred
to/from.

  Full details can be found at
https://store.station.sony.com/eq_char_moves/index.jsp

3.5    Q: How do I alt+tab out of EverQuest and return to the game?  It 
would really be helpful if I could use Notepad or the web while I'm 
playing?

A: SOE has enabled windowed mode in EQ.  To activate it, hit alt+enter. 
Then
hit alt+shift+R to release the mouse.  Once that is done, you can
minimize the
window that EQ is on, and run other tasks, surf the web, or even open
another
instance of EQ if your machine can handle that and you have another
account on
which to play.  Note, this ability to break out of EQ and stay in the
game seems
somewhat glitchy, and doesn't work well for all users and can be broken
after
major patches.

3.5.1   Q: How do I get Alt+Tab to work for Windows XP
 
A: (From the EQ Live FAQ, with some modifications owing to the dead link
they provide)
Windows XP keeps a list of program compatibility information. Up until
recently, EverQuest was not built to allow Alt + Tab, and so our
executable
ended up in this list explicitly preventing the Alt + Tab functionality.
Obviously that has changed. We are working on getting that changed. But
in
the meantime, if you are using Windows XP and you would like to enable
Alt +
Tab, there is a way to get it to work.
 
First, you'll need the Windows Application Compatibility Toolkit. 

http://www.microsoft.com/windows/appcompatibility/toolkit.mspx
or if it wraps 

http://tinyurl.com/9bf1 



You'll need to download and install the toolkit. Then:
Open the Compatibility Administration Tool.
At the top go to Search - Query.
Search for EverQuest.
Double click the item the search finds.
Right-Click the EQGame.exe entry and choose Disable.


3.6    Q: What is a hotkey?

A: A key that is customized to perform an in-game function

3.7    Q: How do I make a hotkey?

A: Refer to the in game help section, which can be found by clicking on
the
question mark on the Window Selector.  

3.8    Q: How do I make a spell a hotkey?

A: Left-click and hold down the button over the spell that you want to
hot key
until that spell icon appears on your cursor.  Then drag that icon to
your
hotkey bank, and left click again to drop into the slot that you want in
in.  

You can also make hot keys from inventory slots the same way.
To access bags and items from the hot-key panel.

3.9    Q: What is a social?

A: Making a social allows you to execute line commands and say 
predefined phrases with a single keystroke.

3.10    Q: How do I make a social?

A: On the main screen, press the Socials button.  Several buttons will 
appear with pre-made social key commands.  You can edit a hotkey by 
right-clicking it.  To edit a line of a social, just click it and start 
typing.  You can edit the name of the social in the same manner.
When you finish, you can make your social into a hotkey.  When you 
activate the social, it will execute whatever you typed in on the lines 
of the social key.  For example, you can make a social that looks like 
this:
/afk
/groupsay I'm going away from keyboard for a sec, guys.
And if you activated this social key, it would flag you AFK, and you'd 
tell your group "I'm going away from keyboard for a second, guys."
Any "line command" (command that starts with a slash) can be used in a 
social.  There are even a few commands that are specifically intended 
for use in socials.  For more information on these commands and others, 
read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest directory.

3.11    Q: How do I change the colors of the text?

A: To do this ingame, go to the Options section of your Window selector,
or type
Alt-O, then open up the colors section to the far right.  Click on the
button of
the text type you'd like to change, then adjust the color to your
liking.

3.12    Q: Where can I get an up-to-date list of commands and/or emotes?

A:  Type /help to get a list of games commands.  You can also try the
eqmanual_supplement.doc file in your EverQuest directory. 
Also, if you visit http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ and scroll down for 
the links to "Commands..." you will find 3 selections, "Emotes...", 
"Game Commands...", and "Chat Terms...".

3.13    Q: What are all these abbreviations and acronyms?  What does it 
all mean?

A: Here is an excellent glossary that can help you with this baffling
matter.
http://web.archive.org/web/20030604092025/http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/eqglossary.htm

If that wraps try http://tinyurl.com/2qnmb

3.14   Q: Where should I hunt at my particular level/class/race?

A: The following sites have good charts on this.
http://www.eqatlas.com/huntguidelevel.html
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/zones/Level_Chart.html

3.15   Q: How can I make some money to buy spells and armor and stuff?

A: Kill things, loot them, sell the proceeds, repeat.  If you are a
level one
newbie then you might want to check out the Qeynos newbie yard.  Kill
snakes and
rats, they have drops that can sell for 2 gold or more rarely 2 plat if
you
happen to find a Plague rat tail.  Once you out grow this little gold
mine of a
spot the best you can probably do is to find items to sell to other
players in
the bazaar.  Spiderling silks, spider silks, bone chips and various
pelts can
all be sold to player for considerably more than merchants will play for
them. 
Check the prices these are going for in the bazaar and you might be
pleasantly
surprised.

Also if your character can use the forage skill you can forage many
nice things to sell in the bazaar that higher level players need for
trade
skills.

3.15a  Q: That's taking too long!  How about I just beg some money?

A: Sure, there are tons of fabulously wealthy people walking past you. 
And if
you beg from them, there is a fairly good chance that some of them might
give
you something.  But DON'T do this.  People tend to get angry at beggars,
and
they are considered by many to be the lowest form of life in the EQ
universe. 
You will damage your reputation, end up on ignore lists, and stand a
good chance
of being insulted with varying degrees of venom.  
   Also, if someone is trying to beg from you, feel free to ignore
them.  Not
giving them money does not mean that you aren't a nice person, anymore
than not
making an effort to feed cockroaches makes you an animal hater.

3.15b   Q: Well, how about just buying plat then?

A: You've seen the banners and advertisements at various EQ sites, and
it does
seem to be a quick way to get the plat/item you're lacking?  Should you
do it? 
Well, there are a few different schools of thought on this matter.
  First is hell yes, we need your business and all your friends are
doing it and
you can't play without it and give us your freaking credit card number
already!
 Second is more laid back.  Some people think that buying plat and
equipment is
a personal decision, and if someone has enough real life money to spend
it this
way then no harm done.
 Third is probably the most common, or at least has the most vocal
people in
it.  They feel that EQ plat buyers/sellers are doing a Very Bad Thing,
and they
have several reasons for this that many find to be compelling.  
 1) It is against the End User License Agreement (EULA).  You know, that
thing
you click past every time you play EQ.  When you do that, you are in
effect
agreeing to what is written there.  One of the things it says is that
you won't
do this.  You're not a scummy liar, are you?
 2) That plat and those items are farmed, and farmers hurt the honest
folk who
are trying to play the game.  Are you trying to earn your very own Shiny
Do-Dad
of Awesome Wowzer, but some guy named Eqpharmer always seems to be at
the camp
where the  Enraged Snow Pea that drops it spawns?  You pay the same
money to
play EQ that he does, you should have a chance to earn the item same as
he,
instead of being shut out because he has to sell it support his on-line
porn
habit.  Same thing for good money camps.
 3) People that buy their equipment/plat/characters are not really
learning how
to play the game, and thus are more likely to hurt the poor saps that
have the
misfortune of being in the same zone as them when they blunder through
causing
trains and mayhem.
   Soooo.... should you do it?  That is up to you, of course.  Just know
that if
you do, a fairly good chunk of your fellow EQ players will think less of
you
because of it.

3.16    Q: Why can mobs hit through walls?

A: I was happily trading inside a vendor's shop, when suddenly I died 
seeing 'A Griffon hits you for 300dmg... loading, please wait...' - 
WTF...
Computer AI controls mobs and other NPCs in EQ, which is no substitute 
for a <supposedly> intelligent human being controlling an avatar. 
Monsters all behave according to strict rules on pathing, aggro-range 
etc., and don't really employ sophisticated tactics and strategy in the 
same way a human player would. To avoid unbalancing the game, Verant 
have opted to give mobs an 'unfair' advantage - they can hit through 
walls, they ignore the z-axis of 3D space to hit from a long way above 
or below a player, and generally have the ability to hit back from 
seemingly unreachable locations. This is to avoid exploits like getting 
easy experience by raining down spells or arrows on a mob from a 
location, which that mob (because of it's programmed pathing) cannot 
reach. Pet using classes may gain some satisfaction from the knowledge 
that their pets have the same unfair advantages as other mobs, and can 
hit back at that pesky monster whacking you from under the ground...

There are other things NPC monsters are immune to that would be good for
a you to know: NPCs and monsters can't Drown, take falling
environment damage, or be burned by environment lava. They can also
'warp' (teleport instantly) to you if they get stuck in the world
geometry.

3.17    Q: Hey, I can't even play at all!  The servers are down!  What
gives?

A: SOE is ripping you off, the sons of bitches.  Well, that's the
sarcastic
answer.  Actually, Everquest is an evolving game, and it requires
periodic
maintenance known as patches.  Patch time is also when various changes
to gameplay (some good, some
not so good) are made.  SOE does not promise that you'll be
able to play 24/7/365.  SOE will not compensate you the 40 cents per day
or
whatever it is for the time you could not play.  Also, SOE will bring
down the
servers with little or no notice if they learn of a bug or exploit that
they
consider to be major.  You can check on scheduled downtime by going to
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/scheduled_downtime.jsp .

3.18    Q: Why did I get chewed out for inspecting someone?

A: Many people feel that it is very rude to inspect someone without
asking
first, akin to walking up to a woman and pulling down her pants to read
the
label on her underwear.  Others feel it's no big deal, and people who
make a big
deal out of it need counseling, or a long flame session, or something
equally
useful.  Regardless of how you feel about the matter, if you want to do
your
best to get along with your fellow EQ players, it is best to simply ask
before
you inspect.

3.19   Q: How can I send a message to my friend on another server?

A: ;tell servername.friendname message. For example, to send your friend
Giggals
on the Karana server while you are playing on The Seventh Hammer you
would
simply type ;tell karana.giggals Tag! You're it!  You do not need to
include a
forward slash / when you do this.

3.20   Q: Can I ignore someone on another server?

A: You betcha.  If it turns out that Giggals simply hates tag and is now
threatening to kill you, over and over again, type /ignore
karana.giggals . 
This also can be useful for people who are being pests in any serverwide
channels you might be in.


3.21   Q: What is grouping about?  What am I supposed to do in one?

A: Tyas of our newsgroup wrote a nifty primer on that.  I've edited it
slightly
to give it a generic point of view rather than the enchanter's point of
view it
had before, and made some minor additions as well.  

Grouping 101: How to make friends and get lotsa lewt.

First thing is to decide if you are a sit at home group, or a roaming
group.
sit-at-home's tend to do better, and become the norm after 15-20th.
Basically, the group finds a spot, and everyone with the exception of
one
player (the 'puller', who is not necessarily the 'tank' but can be)
stays
there, while the puller goes and finds things, gets their attention, and
brings them back to be slaughtered.

There are many many 'roles' in a group, some classes fit strongly in one
niche and no others (Wizard=Non-tanking damage dealer), some do well on
the
swing shift (Druids can be damage dealers, healers/buffers, or primitive
crowd control.) Know your role.

Roles:
Puller: You go out and find things for the group to kill. A Puller has
to
have the mental ability to navigate, There are paladins you have to
lead everywhere, but they can tank like noone's business. A puller on
the
other hand, can't afford to get lost on his way back to the group.
Lost=dead
and could= nasty Corpse Recovery. Classwise, it helps if the puller has
ways
to control the number of creatures it's pulling, or if it can pull at a
distance.  Characters that can mezz/pacify MOBs to reduce the chances of
pulling
too many include bards, paladins, clerics, and enchanters.  Rangers and
druids can also do this when outside.  Sometimes a puller
will work with the crowd controller, where the CC person will pacify on
MOB,
then the puller will engage another.  Another way to control the number
of
things pulled is to have a feign death puller.  Classes that feign death
include
monks, shadowknights, and necromancers (though since nercos have low
hitpoints,
they aren't often called upon to pull). 
     Another useful skill to pulling is tracking.  Tracking is the
ability to see what creatures (and players, also) are near the
tracker, and what direction they are in.   Tracking classes
include rangers at level 1, and at higher levels druids and
bards.  The most skilled trackers are rangers, who can sort what
results they see in their track window by distance, rather than
seeing the results sorted by spawn order in the zone. 

Tank: You've got time to bleed. It's your job. The 'main tank' is the
person
designated to soak up most of the damage that the mob is dealing out. A
tank can also be
puller, but in a fast group having a separate puller speeds things up
even more.
The classic tanks are Warrior, Shadow Knight, and Paladin. Other classes
can
make do in a pinch, and at lower levels the Bard, Ranger, Monk,
Beastlord, and
Rogue can make do better than most others.

Non-tank damage dealer: Most characters can do this role. You DOT it,
nuke
it, beat it with a stick, sic your pet on it, poke it in the back with
pointy things, make it a pin cushion. Once you get into the teens, and
especially the 20s, most classes can no longer stand up to the pounding
of a
dark blue con mob, but some can dish out enormous damage.

Snarer: Druids, rangers, bards, necromancers, shadowknights, and higher
leveled
wizards (Area Effect) can 'snare' their targets. Lacking those classes,
you can get it rooted by others, but
snare is better. At around 25% health many mobs will turn to run. This
can
be bad. With snare, they tend to turn to run and not be able to move,
meaning everyone gets to pound the targets for free.

Crowd control: The Enchanter's specialty, crowd control is the art of
having the
puller
come back with several mobs, and getting all but the one the group is
going
to concentrate on out of action for a bit. This can be by charming,
mezzing,
rooting, snare/fearing, off tanking with pets or tough tanks, dropping a
spell on them and kiting them around, whatever, but the concept is that
the
fight will go better if you can concentrate your firepower as much as
possible on one target at  a time.  Bard's are also considered to be a
crowd
control class.

Healer: People bleed. Healers make them better. Most healers also
'buff'.

Buffer: Buffers contribute more indirectly to the cause. An enchanter
may do
less than 1% of the damage the group does personally, but their haste
spells
on the tanks, and mana regen spells on the nukers, mean their effective
contribution probably approaches half the damage the group is doing. The
cleric makes the tank better with his AC/HP buffs. Makes the enchanter a
better
Crowd
controller too, as they can take a few hits now. Most casters have at
least a
few buffs. Shamans can load a person down, and are in high demand
because of
it.

Debuffer: What buffers do to players, debuffers anti-do to mobs. An
enchanter, along with that nice 70% or so haste, has a 50% or so slow,
which
means the mob swings half as often.  Shamans, bards, and beastlords can
also
slow mobs down.  Snare is technically a debuff but is
important enough to get it's own section above.

Supply sergeant: The mage has a special skill most other classes don't
have
in any quantity, the ability to summon lots of odds and ends the group
can
find useful. Bandages, arrows, throwing knives, levitation rings, food,
water, vision items, weapons, armor, (good for pets), and caster focus
wear... at high levels a mage can outfit an entire group for that nasty
corpse recovery.  A few other classes get food and drink, and a few
miscellaneous items.
There are other roles, but that gets the major ones.

For the two classes you listed:
Cleric: Traditional duty: Healer/buffer. Other roles: Nuker, especially
against undead. For all that they wear plate they really cannot tank.
As a low level cleric you will spend most of your time with your rear
end on
the ground, medding back that oh so precious mana. What you want to do:
Figure out what are your hp buffs. Those need to be cast on the main
tank
(at your low level however, there may not be a well defined tank), and
anyone else that regularly takes hits. If you have the mana available to
do
it the good way to do this is to cast it on yourself, then each other
character that is going to get it in turn. Then when yours starts
blinking
you know everyone is about to lose their buff.

Pay attention to everyone's hitpoints... When they get low, heal them.
Learn
how much of the 'bar' your heals do on each player... it will be
different
based on gear and class! Only 'top off' people's health during a lull
when
you have full mana.

Mana reports: Sometimes you will get a group, and you will see the tank
ask
'Mana?' or 'mr?'. He wants to know the percentage of mana you have
available. Each bubble is 20%, and you can eyeball to about 5%, so
report in
10s or 5s (eg /g 70)

Each person has their own style. Some report in bubbles (70% is 3.5),
others
actually roleplay it a bit ('meez gotz 3 mugs of sparklies left' for a
troll
shaman... that's 3 bubbles)

Another is frequency.  Some groups that grind up mana hard up and
down the bar, so some report every time the puller is going out to get
more
munchies. In some groups when your mana is just hovering between 40%-80%
most of
the time, you'll only want to warn at 20% to 30%m or announce when
you're at
full mana (/g fm) so they know we need to kill faster cause they are not
pushing you at
all.
(terminology info, some will use /g lom and /g oom for low on mana, out
of
mana.

Paladin: Paladins can be a puller (the lull line helps them there, and
stun
pulling gives you a head start back), and are designed to be a tank.
With
heavy armor and lots of hitpoints, plus their own buffs and the ability
to
heal themselves some, they make good tanks. Learn to love the 'taunt'
button.  Depending on what you are fighting and how things are going,
you
may be spot healing yourself, stunning, or just using your mana for
pulling.
Lay on hands is your 'fix me now!' key, and  also good when the wizard
gets
agro and is folding like wet cardboard. You can be a pocket healer if
necessary, but there are several better alternatives out there. Still
it's
better than Mr. Monk can do for others.

Basically in most groups your job will be to go get things for people to
kill, attack targets, try to maintain agro so you bleed the most, and
spend
your mana reasonably (If you're not using any of it you're not using
your
class to it's fullest.) Note do not just step in and try to take over
agro
if you join an existing group with an existing tank. Figure out which
one
will be bleeding the most... the other should generally not taunt,
though
stunning, etc is useful.

3.22    Q. All those expansions, plus regular free patches that have
tweaked the
game...I've heard that Everquest's game balance has changed a lot since
it
first came out. Is that true and if so, how so?

A. Yes, definitely. EQ has been adjusted fairly continuously from the
get-go, in ways big and small. The developers have always said that the
game
would never be frozen in time, and they've meant it. Here is a very
brief
summary picture.

The initial learning curve has been eased, a lot. It's easier and
quicker to
get a character up to level 10, and the game has a lot more helpful
hints
and more obvious directions on what to do.

The developers have regularly adjusted the powers of the various
classes,
trying to keep the classes balanced. Several classes are now
significantly
more or less powerful relative to each other than was true at different
times in the past. Right now [spring 2004] there isn't any particular
class
that is really widely seen as in need of being "nerfed" (reduced in
power)
or boosted, but the game is dynamic and that will undoubtedly change.

The consequences of dying in EQ have been reduced quite a bit, though
once
you hit level 11 death does cost you experience. The dreaded "corpse
run" to
reclaim your gear is now much easier than back in the day, and it's
easier
to get "resurrected" by another player (which gets you back some of the
experience you lost by getting killed). Dying in EQ is still annoying
but
it's not much more than that except in a few unusual circumstances.

Traveling around in Norrath is far easier/quicker than was originally
true
(the gameworld is much bigger too). One side effect of that is that
racial
faction is less of a factor now -- being a dark elf or troll used to
have a
pretty severe downside in terms of moving around the world without NPCs
attacking you on sight. They added an in-game player market (the Bazaar)
which made the in-game player-to-player market of gear and items much
more
efficient and therefore more ubiquitous.

While the developers have drastically eased the game for newbies
(old-school
players call it "training wheels EQ"), they've also repeatedly extended
and
broadened the endgame. In any game there is a point at which a player
character has seen it all, done it all, and advanced in power to the
point
of there being no challenges left. EQ began with a level cap of 50, that
jumped to 60 and then 65; "alternate advancement" levels were added,
then
deepened. More high-end zones have been added, many with big tough
"boss"
mobs that can only be killed by large parties of high-end players
(called
"raids"). Entire tiers of such zones, called the "Planes", now have a
complex lengthy "trials" process for which reaching level 65 is just the
start. In general, hard-core players now tend to view level 65 as just
the
first step towards becoming "uber".

The Lost Dungeons of Norrath ("LDoN") expansion added a fundamentally
new
way to play the game. That expansion's "instanced" zones are timed
quests,
where a single group must accomplish a certain mission within 90 minutes
in
order to get certain rewards. A group can have only 6 players and group
lineups vary based on who's available, and once they enter the dungeon
the
group can't get help from any other players. A single group cannot
possibly
include the top specialist class of every group function (tanking,
healing,
offensive spellcasting, and several others); that forces some creativity
in
tactics and makes versatile classes more useful (some other aspects of
EQ
tend to reward specialization). The time limit forces the minds -- many
veteran players say that LDoN adventuring "makes people really learn how
to
play their class." Unlike the planes and some other content, LDoN
adventuring is available from quite early in a character's lifespan,
level
20. The rewards for these adventures are in _addition_ to earning
regular
experience, and create a way to get fairly high-end equipment without
joining Planes raids for 10-hour sessions.


3.23    Q. What is a "guild"?

A. The word "guild" is used two different ways in EQ and they have
nothing
to do with each other. In the game's cities there are buildings called
class
guilds (the warrior guild in Kaladim, say); not every city has a guild
for
every class. In each guild are NPCs you interact with: a guildmaster
where
you train your character's skills, and vendors where you can buy your
spells
and some other stuff.

The other form of guild is player guilds, which are voluntary
associations
formed and managed by players themselves on each server. The name of the
guild displays in the game next to the character's name, and guilds get
their own private chat channels in-game. Many guilds have websites where
discussion forums and schedules of group outings in the game.


3.24   Q. What is being in a player guild like?

A. It's like being a member of any other self-directed voluntary
association: as good as the people in it. The best way to find a guild
is to
chat with players you've grouped with repeatedly in the game and enjoyed
playing with, and at some point mention that you've thought about
joining a
guild. If they're enjoying playing with you, you may receive an
invitation.
Guilds that run around randomly inviting players they haven't even met
before tend to end up about as cohesive and enjoyable as any other group
of
complete strangers thrown together.

Player guilds fall into about three categories at the moment, these
being
completely unofficial but widely recognized. First of all, each server
has
some high-end "raiding guilds", which can include hundreds of players,
are
focused on lengthy well-planned Planes raids, and have increasingly
stiff
prerequisites for membership (you must have reached a certain level in
the
game). Most servers now have unofficial schedules that the top few
raiding
guilds agree on for raids of the very top Planes zones.

Next there are newer/smaller guilds that aspire to become raiding
guilds; at
any given moment most servers have several of these. Such a guild might
have
anywhere from 30 to 60 active members, and be recruiting players who
either
have reached the top levels or appear serious about getting there
quickly.
Since serious raiding requires playing for 8 or 10 hours at a stretch,
such
guilds tend to include mostly people who are single, not raising kids,
don't
have jobs that require a lot of travel, etc. These guilds are trying to
build up the strength (number of top-level seriously-equipped players of
enough classes) to join the top-Planes raiding rotation of their server;
some make it and some don't.

Finally there are the "family guilds". This phrase isn't literal, it
refers
to guilds of more casual players who aren't strongly aspiring to the
high-end raiding. In practice this often means players who are married
with
children, etc. These guilds tend to have fewer than 50 active members
(maybe
a lot fewer). They may do some entry-level Planes raiding now and then;
two
family guilds may band together for the occasional joint raid. Mostly
these
guilds do regular "experience grouping" together, and increasingly they
tend
to do a lot of LDoN adventuring together. Some family guilds were
started by
longtime EQ players who had been in raiding guilds but burned out on
that or
found that it wasn't actually how they most enjoyed the game.


4      Everquest II

4.1     Q: What is this Everquest II game that I hear about?

A: Everquest II is another MMORPG that is under development by SOE and
is
thought to be released later this year.  The time of release keeps
getting
pushed back.  It is set in the world of Norrath, several hundred years
in the
future after the planet has suffered some major cataclysm that destroys
much of
the known world.

4.2     Q: Does this mean that the Everquest I am playing will end then?

A:  Everquest II is not meant to be a replacement for Everquest Live. 
Both
games have different development teams, and SOE steadily maintains that
it means
to maintain both games for as long as there is enough of a demand to
keep them
both going.  Everquest is currently a very popular title, and it has
managed to
maintain this despite challenges from other MMORPG's that people have
sworn
would mean its decline.  That said, few things in life are guaranteed,
and if EQ
drops in popularity for whatever reason to the point that is no longer
profitable, it is unrealistic to expect that SOE will continue it. 
Still, the
day when they do pull the plug on Everquest Live seems to be remote at
this
time. 

4.3     Q: How can I find out more about Everquest II? 

A:  There is a section in the links portion at the bottom of this
document that
will lead you to EQII websites. 


5.    Getting along with people in alt.games.everquest

5.1     Q: I posted one little innocent question, and got flamed.  Why?

A: alt.games.everquest has an established community, and several of the
long
time residents have strong personalities.  We also have a steady influx
of new
users here, many of who make no effort at all to do any research at all
before
they ask questions.  This combination seems to bring out the
flame-throwers on a
regular basis.  Also, we also have several here who enjoy a long,
repetitious,
self imploding discussions laced with personal attacks and
explicatives.  If you
do find yourself getting flamed, probably the best step to take would be
to just
shrug it off, and not reply in kind.  It is very useful to have a thick
skin in
AGE, and a little common sense isn't a bad idea either.

5.2     Q: So does that mean that I can't ask any questions here at all?

A: Not at all. There are many people here who are very knowledgeable
about EQ
and are happy to share what they know.  It would be helpful if you were
to some
basic research before you ask questions that may have been asked many
times
before.  One thing you might try is going to
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=alt.games.everquest&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&btnG=Google+Search  
or if it wraps http://tinyurl.com/26o6r , check the "Search only in
alt.games.everquest" radio button, and then type in some keywords from
your
question.  But if that doesn't help, by all means fire away.  If you get
flamed
for it, refer to question 5.1 of this FAQ.

5.3    Q: What is top posting, and why is it so hated here?

A: Top posting is the act of posting your reply on top of quoted
material,
rather than placing your response at the bottom of quoted material or
interspersed throughout it.  AGE is a newsgroup that on the whole feels
strongly
about top posting, and the feelings are not warm and fuzzy.  The topics
of
discussion in AGE are often complex and wandering, and having to scroll
to the
bottom of a post to see what the heck a person is replying to is awkward
and
annoying, and breaks the flow of the post.  You might prefer top posting
and
that is your prerogative, but if you insist on using it here be prepared
to be
flamed and to land on a lot of Kill Files.  And please don't try to
skirt the
issue by just not quoting anything at all, either.  People are not going
to go
back through the thread playing detective to try to figure out what the
heck
you're responding to.  

5.4   Q: I've noticed alot of unfriendly posts coming from the same
people over
and over.  This newsgroup sure has it's share of jerks, eh?

A: It would be hard to find an active newsgroup that doesn't.  However,
many of
the more virulent posters we have are basically right in what they say,
once you
look past the rudeness of manner of their presentation.  They may be
enthusiastic in going after people who post facts or opinions that they
dispute.  But if you can get past that, you might find that they can
teach alot
about EQ.  If you can't get past it, no worries.  Just ignore them or
place them
in your Kill File.  Endless arguing with them will not generally make
anyone
think you are especially clever, or put them in their place, or do
whatever it
is you are hoping to do.  Also, if you makes some clever misspelling of
a
regular's posting name in an effort to win an argument, you
automatically lose
that argument.  /nod

5.5   Q: Will everyone hate me if I make an off topic comment or post?

A: No, not everyone.  Practically every active newsgroup out there
experiences
some degree of topic drift, this is just the nature of the beast.  AGE
is a
fairly active group, and the drift is quite noticeable at times.  If
this annoys
you then it it best to just start ignoring a thread when it goes from
talking
about the best offhand weapon for a halfing ranger to the best way to
make
nachos. Something to keep in mind is that you have about a good a chance
of
stopping topic drift as you do of stopping continental drift.  If you
are going
to start a new thread that is clearly not related to EQ, it is a good
idea to
start it with the letter OT (off topic) so that those who want to can
avoid it
from the start.

5.6   Q:  I posted something I heard was true, and then some guy jumped
all over
me for being wrong!  It wasn't that big of a deal.  Why?
 
A:  Because that's something that is important to several posters
here.   In
this place, a.g.e., we do check facts.  We will google while we post,
and we
will google and research other people's assertions if we feel they are
in
error.  And we do ask for and expect cites. This might be viewed as good
and as
bad.  Bad, because we can come across as niggling, harsh, and overly
intolerant
to dubious statements. But also good, because if you read a fact here
about some
aspect of EQ, you can be fairly certain that if it isn't correct at the
start,
it will almost certainly be corrected quickly.  Of course, in many
instances the
"facts" aren't really available, and it might even be questionable if
anyone in
SOE even knows the answer.  Then you will get a long, drawn out
discussion,
usually with flaming, where people will discuss their opinions on the
matter at
hand. Once you get used to the place, and learn the standards we hold
ourselves
and others to, you might find that it is well worth the effort.

   Newsgroup Etiquette.

The following is a list of WebSites for viewing common etiquette
techniques for newsgroups.
Quoting Style in Newsgroup Postings:
http://www.xs4all.nl/~wijnands/nnq/nquote.html
General Net Etiquette:
http://www.templetons.com/brad/emily.html

Here is a generic Netiquette guide.  You can take most of what is here
to almost
any newsgroup you go to.


o	Newsgroups are like self-governing communities; there are no 
"Newsgroup Cops." Instead, posters regulate themselves. Below are some 
simple rules of newsgroup etiquette to understand before you venture 
into a newsgroup.  Think of newsgroup etiquette as a set of guidelines 
that will keep you from making mistakes and make you look and sound like 
a veteran newsgroup poster.
o	This is a non binary newsgroup, please do not post binaries.
o	Do not post in HTML
o	Lurk. Read the newsgroup without posting for a few weeks. This is 
known as "lurking," and it will give you the flavor of the newsgroup.
o	Read the FAQ. Find and read the newsgroup's FAQ, or list of 
Frequently
Asked Questions and other important and useful information. It can 
answer questions you didn't even know you had, and it's the quickest way 
to learn a newsgroup.
o	Stay on-topic. Know what's on-topic and what's off-limits. Every 
newsgroup is a little different in what it talks about, and how it does 
the talking.
o	DON'T SHOUT. TYPING IN ALL CAPS IS CONSIDERED SHOUTING. It's 
easier to read a mix of upper- and lower-case letters.
o	Never, ever post "MAKE MONEY FAST." It doesn't work, it gets 
people really mad, and no matter what it says, it's probably illegal.
o	Everyone hates commercials. Be very hesitant about posting [ed.
Hesitant
hell.  Don't do it!]
advertisements or commercial messages. This also gets people really mad.
o	Ignore "trolls." Some people get a thrill from posting "flames" 
(really obnoxious messages) just to get a rise out of people. Sad, isn't 
it?
o	Don't "spam." Spam is posting the same message to dozens, even 
hundreds or thousands of unrelated newsgroups. No matter how important 
you think your message may be, it's not worth it. Think about it - if 
everyone posted about every topic, no one would be able to find 
anything.
o	Be Original. Don't over quote: Copying a long post (more than 20 
lines) just to add "I agree" or "me too" is considered bad form. Make 
clear who and what you are replying to.

o	The Golden Rule: Do unto others, as you would have them do unto 
you.
Remember, every expert was a newbie once.


6. Chat Channels

6.1    Q: What are chat channels?

A: Chat channels are basically chat room like entities that everyone on
your
server can access.  There are also established chat channels that can be
joined by
everyone on every server of EQ, if they so desired.

6.2    Q: How do I join/start a chat channel?

A: Type /join channelname. For example, if you wanted to join the market
channel
on your server, you would type /join market (most servers do have a
market
channel of some sort, though they might be named something else like
auction,
bazaar, or whatever.  If you want to find out, ask around or
experiment).  If
you want to join a channel that has a password, type /join
channel:password . 
For example, to join a market channel with the password of shop, you
would type
/join market:shop .  If you want to create a channel, simply type the
name of
channel you want to create, and a password if you think it should have
one.  If
you want to join a channel on another server, you would type /join
servername.channelname:password.  For example, if you wanted to join the
market
on the Drinal server, you would type /join drinal.market.  In all cases,
the
number to the right of the channel name you have joined tells you how
many
people are in that channel at that time.

6.3    Q: How do I leave a channel I have joined?

A: Type /leave Channel#.  For example, if you have only joined the
drinal market
channel, then it will be channel 1.  To leave it, you would type /leave
1 .

6.4    Q: How do I autojoin a channel?

A: If you know that you want to be in a chat channel every time you are
online,
type /autojoin channelname: password.  If you want to autojoin more than
one
channel, then type it like this /autojoin channelname:password,
nextchannel:nextpassword, and so on.  For example, to join both the
market
channel and the serverwide alt.games.everquest chat channels you would
type
/autojoin market, serverwide.age:age

6.5    Q: How do I un-autojoin a channel?

A: You have to type the autojoin channel again, leaving out the channels
you
don't want to be in anymore.  If you don't want to be in any channels,
you can
either type "/autojoin  , " or you can go into your .ini file and edit
out the
autojoin list as it is shown there.

6.6    A few current serverwide channels.

serverwide.age:age -- the chat channel for this newsgroup.
serverwide.beastlords:beastlords
serverwide.bards:bards
serverwide.cleric:cleric
serverwide.druidsgrove:password -- main druid's chat channel
serverwide.eqlive.tnz - The Newbie Zone on the offical Sony EQlive
Forums
serverwide.enchanter:enchanter
serverwide.eqdruids:eqdruids
serverwide.eqtraders:eqtraders -- Trade skills channel, not character
trades!
serverwide.magicians:fluffy
serverwide.paladins:paladins
serverwide.ranger:ranger
serverwide.rangersglade.glade
serverwide.sk:sk --- Shadowknight channel

Others to follow as they are discovered.


6.7    Q: I've joined too many channels and now the text is flying by
too
fast!  What to do??  How do I open multiple chat windows?

A: Chat windows allow a player to use multiple windows for specific chat
tasks.  For example, if you are on a guild raid you can have all your 
say and guild text in one window, and your raid and battle spam in 
another.  You can create as many windows as you like, but most players
opt for no more than two or three, as the screen gets too busy.

Right click on the black title bar of your main main chat window where
it 
says "Main Chat".  The second option down on the list is "New chat 
window".  Left click on that to bring up your new chat window.  Your new 
chat window will appear over the top of the main chat window, and can be 
dragged to another location and re-sized if you wish.

In the new chat window, right click on the title bar and choose
filters.  
Another menu opens which allows you to choose which types of messages go 
into the new window.  You can continue customizing these windows with 
the filters to split the different types of chat between the windows.

6.8    Q: My map window fills my whole screen and I can't see where I'm 
going with it up!  Help!

A: The map window, and in fact all windows, can be made transparent by  
opening up the menu for the window and right clicking on its title bar, 
then hovering the cursor above the first option, "Window".  This will
show 
another drop down menu.  Hover the cursor over "Alpha", then select
faded 
level by left clicking.  You will get a box to enter a value of 0 to
100.  
0 will make the box, but not the text, completely transparent, 100 will
make the box completely opaque, and 50 will make it semi-transparent.  
Please note that you cannot generally click on or target things through
a 
transparent window. You can also obtain smaller map windows from the
eqinterface site (address below).


7 User Interface (UI)

7.1   Q: I've heard I can use a different User Interface
(UI) to the one that comes with Everquest. How can I do that?

A: The UI that comes with Everquest has been changed over the
years to reflect in-game changes.  Thousands of players use the default
user interface but many have chosen to either write their own or use
the clever UIs written by other people.

The largest collection of UIs for Everquest is held on:
http://www.eqinterface.com/
You will have to logon to get the new UIs but it is free.

Once on this site you will see that there are a number of complete UIs
which change all of the parts of your Everquest world to a specific
theme.  Other areas give you the ability to load smaller map windows,
tailored items for specific classes, maps for zones and even the
ability to drag recipes and spell lists up in your storyline option on
screen.


7.2   Q: How do I get the UI I have downloaded to work in Everquest?

A: In your Everquest folder which can been seen in Windows
Explorer there are a number of sub-folders.  If you are changing your
complete UI go to your "uifiles" folder.  You will see one folder there
called "default".  This contains your stock standard interface you see
on the screen if you have no other UI loaded.  LEAVE THIS FOLDER ALONE
AND MAKE NO CHANGES TO IT.  Under the "uifiles" folder create a new
folder named "me" (it can be called anything but simple is good in this
case.  Unload your downloaded new UI files into the "me" folder.  In
game you will start out with the stock standard UI provided by SOE.  In
your chat window type
/loadskin me
and hit enter.  For a few seconds your screen will stop and then appear
with your new UI loaded.  You will have to re-arrange the screen to
suit your style of play.

     Some UIs such as spell lists or maps which can be downloaded from
here:
<http://www.mapfiend.net/>
require their own folders or can be downloaded straight into existing
folders.  For example the maps mentioned above are downloaded straight
into your "maps" folder under the main "Everquest" folder.  Spells and
trade skills normally appear under the storyline button in game and you
guessed it will be under the "storyline" folder in your "Everquest"
main folder.

      Each of the UIs normally carry instructions for their use, either
on
the web site or in readme files.

7.3   Q: I play a warrior and do not need a caster or mana bar with
my character.  How can I change this?

A: Most of the complete UI sets include modifications for
specific classes.  For example, there are manaless bars for warriors,
new tracking interfaces for druids and rangers the list is endless.  If
you are happy with the general theme you are using use the instructions
as above except to create a specific warrior UI make another folder in
the "uifiles" folder.  Call this folder "warrior" (you can call it
anything, it could also be other class specific names such as "ranger"
whatever is applicable).  Copy all of the same files in your "me"
folder into the "warrior" folder and the additional class specific
files from the http://www.eqinterface.com/ site.  In game, playing
your warrior, at the chat window type loadskin warrior and your new
files should appear without the mana and casting bars.  You can have as
many UI folders as you need to outfit the different classes you play in
game just ensure that they have all the base files in them first then
overwrite with your class specific files.

7.4   Q: My UI does not work after the last patch what has happened?

A: Sometimes SOE change the files for the way their own interface
operates.  Sites such as eqinterface will normally have files to add to
your custom UI after a patch.  Download the new file and overwrite the
file (s) in each of your custom UI folders.

7.5   Q: I want to design and code my own UI how do I go about it?

A: Sites such as <http://www.eq-toolbox.com/> give you the
necessary tools to do so.  Their forum area is also very good for
picking up hints on where to go. Most of the contributors to
eqinterface start out in eqtoolbox.

About maps:

If you have the Legacy of Ykesha expansion it is a real
good idea to get all the maps from eq-toolbox and load
them in your everquest maps folder. Everquest is a HUGE game
with over 200 zones, in game maps help you to get around.

Some map tips:

1. If you pull up the maps and can't see anything then zoom
the map out by clicking on the "-" button on the side of
the map, you man have to click this button many times, alternately
if you have a mouse with a scroll wheel you can hover your
mouse pointer over the map and zoom the map in and out with
the scroll wheel. Also turn off the height filter, this will show
all the lines on the maps.

2. If the map is hard to see because the lines are too light
then right click on the title bar of the map and change the 'Alpha'
'fade' and 'normal' levels to lighten the background of the map.
This allows you to see the map and the screen behind it so it
doesn't block your view. This is why so many maps are drawn
with grey lines.

For player equipment prices:

The following site does have a list of prices for various items, but the
information it gives is suspect for a few reasons.  For one, the going
price on
any particular item can vary to a great deal from server to server. 
Also,
prices often rise or fall over time given to inflation, deflation, and
newer,
better items becoming more common.  Another problem with this site is
that the
prices are given by the player base, many of whom may have had the item
they
were pricing for sell at the time they reported the price, making them a
biased
source of information.
