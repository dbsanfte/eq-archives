Well here is what EQ's official web site rules of conduct says
(available at:

http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp

====================

[snip]

3. You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.

There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same NPC or
hunt in the same area. In these cases, the groups are required to
compromise. 

If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior
to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will
mandate a compromise. Any such compromise is final and not open to
debate. Refusing to abide by these terms will be considered disruption
and may result in disciplinary action. 

It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt
to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an
EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the
extent that a player-devised compromise would.

Note: A "group" in this case is defined as a party of one or more
characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable
of completing that goal.
