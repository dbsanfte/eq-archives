Most epic quests, the NPCs will simply "eat" the turn-in items if you
try to hand them in before level 50. BST and I think SHM are two
exceptions (Heard Bard, too, but no confirmation). For the BST epic,
at least, the NPC won't talk to you before somewhere around 50, but
you can still do the turn-ins at any time and get the appropriate
rewards. :(
