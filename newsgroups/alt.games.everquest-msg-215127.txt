That's a great concept until you realize that the boss doesn't always spawn
in the same spot.  :)

I've assassinated "Hessel the something-or-other" or whatever that guy's
name is three times.  It's the only assassinate adventure I've gotten more
than once, so I don't know about the others, but he was in three different
spots.  Same dungeon layout, same mob name, same group composition (hell,
same group), but different spots all three times.
