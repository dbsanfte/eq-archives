Okay, some comments from an ex-EQer (the worst kind of EQer!)

Pah hill giants are the original reason to go there, lots of old low level
quests n stuff there too.

It is not natural for a cleric to heal a kiter imo, then again, it isnt
really natural for a bard to kite unless they have some new fangled aggro
holding I dont know about.  Best kite choices were / are SK, Pala, druid,
necro or ranger.  Druid's, Necro's and Rangers will probably have more
experience kiting.  A wizard could do it in a pinch ;p  Anything but a bard
(barring anything new.)

Thanks for the read, doubt I'll ever come back, mainly cos raids were boring
unless I was leading em! :P
