   It would be nice if my general meaning were taken rather than
focusing on one word in one sentence rather than looking at the whole of
what I have been saying.  I feel like my writing is being going over by
a lawyer or something.  Sorry if I sound cranky, but I feel like I'm
just repeating myself, then having to clarify myself when my words are
turned around.  I don't want this to turn into a "but you said" "No YOU
said" affair ala most of the flames that pop up here, so consider me
done after this.   

   Ok.  Yes, if that is happening, a gl should deal with it, by doing
exactly what you describe.  Thus my original statement, that if someone
stays unhappy with how the loot is going, the gl should take care of
it.  

   I'll try to be real clear, since I seem to be having troubles with
that.  I think that a gl is responsible for setting up in advance of the
hunt a loot policy that all agree on, and then enforcing it and letting
all newcomers know what the policy is.  If someone is feeling left out
(and the gl has some way of knowing it) then the gl should fix the
problem.  If someone is not adhering to the policy, then the gl should
do what they need to do fix it, including booting if needed.  But, the
gl is not psychic, and cannot be expected to in advance that a ML might
be corrupt, and steal everything.  Thus, the gl should make an effort to
pick a ML that they know and trust, if possible.  I have probably
forgotten a nuance here or there.

   Generally, and very generally, I am speaking out against gl's who
just ignore looting policy, hoping that everything will turn out just
fine without being attended to.  I would also like to note that I am
often the leader in groups I am in.  It is not easy to keep everyone
happy.  In fact, I think it just can't be done all the time.  But at
least I am trying to do so, and I would like it if other leaders would
do so when I am a member in the groups they are running.
