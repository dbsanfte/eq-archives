    Two notes here:

1) The original Ry'Gorr comment was made to allow for items like the Ry'Gorr
Collar to be used by the warrior over Fine Steel, in addition to the ranger
subbing in. However, when I compared Ivy Etched vs. Ry'Gorr, I found that
AC/HP-wise Ry'Gorr helm, gloves, legs, and bracers beat out Ivy Etched. So a
modern mid-level ranger would be mostly Ry'Gorr, contrary to what you claim
below.
2) I got a Crafted warrior with SSB at 8 raw AC and 15 HPs above a
Ry'Gorr/Ivy ranger. So "not enough to make a difference" is certainly
justified.

    I'm forced to conclude what I saw as a lower level cleric was just bad
gear selection by rangers vs. that of warriors, and the fact Ry'Gorr didn't
exist when I was levelling up. You yourself had some stats gear when you
were younger (I remember that Fire Emerald ring, heh) - imagine other
rangers who think that WIS, DEX and STR are all needed.

    I still seem to remember the rangers in the party having significant HPs
above rangers at the High Keep level (early 30's - late 20's). But that may
be more recent bias talking. When my servers's BotB-winning ranger told me
"You can cast CHeal on me, I have 3000 HPs and 1050 AC" I didn't have the
heart to tell him that my cleric stats were quite close to that (2800 HPs,
920 AC in bad gear).
