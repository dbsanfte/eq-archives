Except that Bob subscribes to 5 *other* newsgroups, and is likely to be 
in several discussions in *each* or at least highly involved in reading 
them.  Also, many newsreaders don't display posts after they've been 
read, to prevent a build-up and easier reading.  That means that Bill can 
come home, find 534 posts in a.g.e. *alone*, and if he read that pizza 
thread *earlier*, that post is gone.  Or, even worse, he never got the 
original thread.  Many many many servers drop random posts.  I myself 
have this problem and it's hard to say what's worse - people quoting a 
370 line post just to say "lol", or people who snip the ENTIRE thing and 
then reply to each point as if we all have a copy of that post sitting in 
front of us at that very moment.  Learn to 'selectively snip' - leaving 
in enough to let others know what you're posting about, and yet not 
leaving it all in to make a one-word comment.

And on another note, DO NOT TRY AND BEND A NEWSGROUP/MAILING LIST TO YOUR 
WILL.  I just got a very nasty note in my inbox from a woman that I sent 
a *polite* explanatory note to when she complained that the mailing list 
administration was 'too strict' in it's 'no off-topic posts' policy.  Not 
such a big problem when it's a small list but what you have in this case 
is a large group of people who are VERY sensitive about their 'rights' to 
express an opinion (why is everybody so hell-bent on forcing usenet to 
listen to THEIR opinion, and then just as hell-bent on flaming those who 
dare disagree with them?) and flamewars were getting very, very common.

Blah.  I'm going to stop before this turns into a huge rant.  But 
sometimes I feel like an old crank.  "Back in MY day, we used UNIX to 
post.  None of your fancy-shmancy outlook express.  EXPRESS.  Pah!  And 
there was no java!"
