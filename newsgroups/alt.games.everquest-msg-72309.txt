Hmmm, speaking of Lord Bob, or Lord Djlamalamalongname as I call him,
what's the smallest force that has dropped him?  I'm sure he can be
dropped with 12, but I'm wondering if a single group could get him.
Maybe when you get the perfect pit group, would give 'em something to
shoot for after you've killed all the specs.
My guild dropped him last week on the way to kill Velk.  There were 6
of us in the zone early, the pit was uncamped, so we headed there, a
2nd group of 6 formed up and came to the pit too, then we had cleared
all the way to him, so we CoH'd a couple more in and dropped him.
Think we have about 15 on for him, maybe 18.  Since we were in the pit
anyway, we decided to get to Velk from below.  Was a great time
clearing the entire pit area and showing everyone the way up.  As far
as I know, 99% of the folks who know about the back way are bards or
enchanters, so suprised quite a few people.  Village group was rather
suprised when we killed him, couldn't figure out how we got past them.
