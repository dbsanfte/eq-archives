I'm not sure why he suggested it, but the part I was replying about is this
(my reason for guessing that he failed to read the post, also as the subject
says, "while AFK").
Quoted from Paragraph 2, sentence 2-4:

"Since now ALT+TAB gives the "crash to desktop" effect (EQ COMPLETELY closes
since you can't get back in anyway), has anyone experimented with using this
as a way to program EQ to close at a certain time?  This is useful if you're
in the Bazaar as a vendor, and need some automated process done while you're
AFK, such as recording a TV show with your capture card.  I'd bet there
isn't a card out there which can run EQ (or any DirectX 3D game), especially
in the Bazaar, or any Luclin zones while capturing MPEG2 or even MPEG1 video
or even low compression AVI video all at the same time."

Sentence 2 (paragraph 2) explains what the question is.  Sentence 3 explains
why I'm needing to shut down EQ while AFK.  Sentence 4 explains why
EQWindows would not be an option unless someone has VERY GOOD reason to
believe that my vdieo card can capture 640x480 resolution 30 frame per
second MPEG2 video with 44.1 KHz 16-bit Stereo audio while running EQWindows
at 800x600 resolution in Luclin Bazaar with all character models & graphics
options set to maximum.

THAT is why I am guessing that they (and many others) failed to read the
post, as well as the last few words (& abreviations) of the subject (the
"while AFK", as in "away from keyboard").

Other than that, if I were wanting to do something else WHILE PLAYING EQ (as
in AT the keyboard), something that didn't involve major usage of my video
card or any other system resources which would likely cause a problem, then
I wouldn't mind as much to someone who replys suggesting EQWindows.  It just
came across as "I'm going to give an answer before I hear the question to
know if my answer is correct."

No, I don't think I've ever seen such a thing in 98SE.  It might be an added
feature in ME, 2000, or XP.  That is why I'd thought of the idea of
experimenting with getting something else to "crash" EQ out (since it
doesn't really crash, just self-close).
