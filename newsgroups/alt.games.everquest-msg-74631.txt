Be warned about the sound blaster live cards, the drivers for the cards are
nasty and many cames have problems with it. EQ has lots of hassel with the
Live card. Sounds not playing at all, sounds being very faint. Sounds
stoping halfway through etc.

My advice is, unless your updating to a surround sound system (which for eq
is great btw) check out with EQ website eetc tech forms what sound cards are
know NOT to have faults with the game hehe. Thats what I did when buying a
new Graphics card.
