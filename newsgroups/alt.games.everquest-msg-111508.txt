Have to reply to this whole rant about rude people on EQ.  My first
character was a ranger.  He's 19 now, but back at level one, I had no idea
how to play the game, and I was in Kelethin, very confusing place for a
character to start.  So anyway, I walk up to this female sitting there, I
imagine memming spells or some such thing.  I asked her how to get to
somewhere or another and she asks if this is my first time playing.  I tell
her yes, and she proceeds to take me to the bank and totally outfits me.  At
level 19 I still haven't replaced a lot of the stuff.  Icetooth's Claws, and
a bunch of armor that has stat effects.  She tells me this is newbie stuff,
but I still don't believe that part.

Second character is a Dark-Elf Necro (decided to try the dark side).  I go
leaving Neriak for the first time, this character runs up behind me and
gives me a gossamer robe and a Dagger of Marnak (I think that's the right
name, +3 Int +15 Mana).  I hadn't even so much as hailed her.  I thanked her
profusely and went on to level the character faster than anything I've seen
in the game thus far.  He's now 5 in only a few hours of playing.  Another
point I had just gotten my first pet spell and knowing I needed bone chips
but about to go to dinner I didn't really have time to go hunt me down a
skelly.  But I was so curious about what the pet would be like, I send out a
shout asking if someone could donate just a couple chips (I was thinking
like 2 or 3, you know, just to summon it, get in one fight and then log).
This girl sends me a tell and asks where I am, finds me and what do you
know, gives me two full stacks of chips.  I was like "Well, that's a lot
more than I asked for, thanks."  *side point*  Odd how all three were
female.....

Anyway, my point in all of this.....I see so many characters begging for
stuff, begging to be twinked, etc.  And I don't imagine they get anything.
Yet I haven't really asked that much (except the chips, and didn't really
even expect a response, but hey, why not try, right?) and I've received tons
of help from people.

Also, with my ranger I'll shout out every now and then, "Will donate for
SoW."  planning on giving 1pp for it.  Druid often walks up SoW's me and
then runs away before I can give him a copper even.  I've been amazed how
nice some people can be on the game.  But then also surprised how rude some
people can be.  As a ranger, I mapped out Kelethin (tired of getting
hopelessly lost in that place) and I'll guide people from time to time, when
I'm not really doing anything else that has my attention.  One time I took a
guy across the city and I of course NEVER expect payment for a few minutes
out of my life, but still, this guy goes into the building, I stood outside
for a moment, and he comes running out, and past me and on his merry way.
Not even a thank you.  That's all I would have liked to have seen, "Hey,
thanks man."  But nothing.  Amazing really.

All of that to say I look forward to getting my character to the point where
he is high enough level and has enough money to help a lot of the new people
running around, the nice and polite ones of course.
