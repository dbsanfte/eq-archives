Thats just cruel. I like it!

 If you wanna REALLY see a tailor cry, wash down a few aviak and drake
eggs with some headys.  =)

I spent this weekend getting to 175 brewing, man headys are EASY
compared to faydwer shakers an mino brews.  I seriously think i gotta
sue Verant for my aching wrists.

Let me put this as succinctly as possible.  CASKS SUCK.
