it is the Bolt line as u both suspected though i also have similar probs
with spells such as Shock o Spikes, but what's even more strange is i can
stand in one place and filer off my bolt and hit a move 1 in 4 times and
niether of us have moved and it's a flat place, no issues with line o sight,
maybe a program's clip prob or something ?
