Well I know its actually slower but if you are looking for damage output
there are the argent protecter 42/49 +damage bonus, and the argent defender
33/49 +damage bonus.

A guild mate of mine, Half-Elven Paladin, has a Defender and he maxes hit
hits at 150. IF yuor double attack kicks in and it hits for that twice,
guess who the mobs are gonna look at first?
