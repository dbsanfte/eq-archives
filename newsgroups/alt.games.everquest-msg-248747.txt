That's not a very clear way of putting it though. Aeryn Dar is not
necessary for zoning into HoHb, just for being able to zone into HoH
without the level exception or vflagging. However if you can get into
HoH by those methods, then you can also get into HoHB via vflag. When
it checks the Mith Marr flag, it only looks at trials, (along with PoJ
trial), not at AD.

So: 

1. You don't have either Trials or AD: you can be vflagged into HoHb
but must do trials at some point to straighten Mith Marr flag out.
I've heard its possible you can't vflag into HoHb if you're already
being vflagged into HoH, but I can't say for sure if that's true or
not, since most people doing MM are 62 and over.

2. You have Trials but not AD: again you can be vflagged into HoHb and
if you do so and kill Mith Marr you have that flag done, but you can't
zone into HoHb without vflag.

3. You have AD but not Trials: You have to be vflagged into HoHb and
can't complete flag without doing Trials, but at least you don't need
to be vflagged into HoH itself.

4. You have both: You're free and clear to Mith Marr.

However, you were right, Jazz's situation is explained under these
scenarios, and no other explanation is needed.
