Either combo should do well in PoD, or any of the tier 1 planes for
that matter. Druids can charm in PoN/PoD or you can do straight up
fights with shaman slow and mage pet tanking in either. If you look at
a map of PoD, there's a valley off to the side with a tunnel complex,
I'd stay away from that area with your duo, some of the spiders can be
pretty tough. Other than that, you should be able to hunt most spots
in PoD. 

There's one nice/safe pull spot that I know of close to the zone line
in PoD, if you head left after you zone in and hug the zone wall,
you'll come to a little ledge up on the zone wall. It's a safe spot
with enough room to root park adds and makes a perfect pull spot since
you often get roamer adds if you just pull to the zone wall. If you
bring your druid, read up on the group quest to get into CoD and check
track for the 4 mobs you need. Even if you don't raid it's a nice and
relatively easy quest to get a free AA and upgrade your charm slot.
Stay out of the castle, although hunting the courtyard would probably
be doable with your duo. If you decide to hunt PoN, just don't jump
off of the dropoff that splits off half the zone. Anything up top
should be duoable.

PoD/PoN has see invis mobs so you aren't particulary safe with invis
there. Not sure what all in PoV sees invis, but there's some undead in
buildings pretty close to zone out that definitely do. Otherwise, most
(all?) of the stuff in the intial part section of PoV (close to zone)
is non-agro. If you want to get to the castle safely, just follow the
water's edge. The servents of Marr won't agro but I don't know if they
have faction, never hunted them. They definitely aren't on the same
faction as the Marr mobs in Halls of Honor, otherwise I'd be KoS in
PoV by now. It's safe to wander the castle but don't stray too far out
into the wastelands on the other side of the castle. Pulling the
badlands is tricky, mainly because of hard-to-see spiders that come in
pairs, and those spiders are nasty even for a lvl 65 duo. Not sure
about PoI or PoJ, I tend to avoid those two zones.
