I think it works ok with Trolls and Ogres, I have not seen the dumbed down
spelling done with Barbarians, before.
My friend had a Barbarian Shaman called Nobody (Based on the Character from
Deadman and who should be in for some nice gear from Ed :ï¿½)) and always
played him along those lines, not trusting other races totally with broken
english but always correctly spelt, eg whenever something happened that he
could blame on elves the comment "stupid pointy ear" would be heard, I think
it ended up being hot keyed.

I have an Iksar Warrior called Lithper who I play as a bit innocent and an
exile and totally oblivious to his own speech impedement...unfortunately few
people seem to get it...example conv goes something like

Player_01 "Hey an Ikky here" (here being Qeynos)
Me "Yeth uth Ikthar like to travel"
Player_01 "eh?"
Me "Thorry?"
Player_01 "wtf"
I normally give up and leave at that point. Some do join in, like the High
Elf Pally who took great pleasure twisting the conversation to make me say
as many words with S's he could...not very paladin like, I thought.

My experiences with other Role Players are generally good, sometimes a
little odd...Like the Half Elf Paladin who wanted to go home to Neriak and
serve Innoruuk....um? I had that conversation twice with two of my
characters so he seemed pretty adamant on going. I generally see how much in
character the other person wants to be, if they act slightly in character
then I will respond by role play but if they speak OOC I won't bother them
with it.
