Nothing?  You are quite a slacker here, then.

Easy one; small wisdom diety.  Retails for about 50pp, +2 wis.

Better, though, would be to hunt in EW for a bit, get yourself four griffin
eggs (and some other relatively easy to get stuff), make fish rolls till you
trivial baking, then do step three of the coldain shawl quest.  You
don't need to so steps one or two, the third step is independant, and
yields a nice range item that has AC, resists, and more importantly
+3 wis and +30 mana.

In general, you want to keep your wis at 200, while upgrading by adding
AC, Mana, and resists... oh, and perhaps HP.  Your other stats are
pretty meaningless as a high level cleric... why in a couple levels you
won't even be able to outdamage a paladin in melee any more.

PS don't let your agility drop under 75, though, that wouldn't be meaningless

PPS you should also collect a nice stack of charisma gear.  Its relatively
cheap, and when you go in to buy a stack of peridot at a time, the
difference between a 53 cha and a 115 cha will be about 100pp.  Just
put it on to make large purchases or sales to vendors, then take it back
off to go hunting.  Carry it with you or leave it in the bank, depending
on your habits.
