I played EQ2 for only about a month and still had a very good feeling about 
it when I left it for WoW.  But I feel like the fits and starts related to 
the graphics would have eventually forced me out, no matter how much I 
enjoyed the game proper.

Constant zone loading, not being able to achieve smooth framerates and 
gameplay even with reducing the graphics to where things looked like 
play-dough, and with a well above minimum spec machine . . . not much fun to 
put up with such for very long.
