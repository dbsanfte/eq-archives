hahahahahahahahahahahah..  far beyond human rights?!  they are a non-profit
organization.  who are you gonna look at for support?  CNN?  Fox News?
another station that is ratings-driven?!  Read what AI claims.  Is that far
beyond human rights?!

incessantly?  hardly. i've never heard it myself.  Isreal better at killing
their enemies?  I'd agree.  Isreal has much more fire power (numberous
tanks, fighter jets, etc.), and their enemies happen to be palestinian men,
women, children, building, cars, plants, and anything else that can be blown
up.  Palestinians have little fire power, and so they run off and retalliate
against the oppression in the form of suicide bombings.

you must be.  keep reading amnesty international's reports (and past
reports) to read about the conditions.
i post sources for support.  i have yet to see any unbiased, credible
support from any of you pro-isrealis here.

> What oppression?

haahhahaahaha... www.amnesty.org  read the articles thoroughly and see if
you can find some of the past articles.

when you kick people out of their homes becuase of who they are, you will
get retalliation.
its not the reasonable choice, what else can you expect from a people who no
comparable support?
how can palestinians give peace a chance when sharon is destroying their
cities?

hahahahahahahah... bush's allies are simply his business partners.  why
doesn't Bush approach Arafat they way Clinton did?
why hasn't he spoken with arafat in person yet?!  Is Isreal an ally or
simply a nation that oftens buy its weapons from the U.S.?
if you don't believe "allies" is simply a term for business partners - how
would you explain our "ally" that is Pakistan?
they currently have thousands (yes, thousands) of schools called madrassas
that spit out new muslim extremists everyday... and Pakistan does nothing to
close these terrorist breeding schools down.  what does Bush do?  he goes
and loans Pakistan millions (or was it billions?) in U.S. tax dollars.  why?
the Unocal pipeline that will flow through southern afghanistan.  its no
surprise that Hamid Karzai (new afghan leader) was a former Unocal
consultant.  the taliban and al quayda are currently regrouping in
Pakistan - i'm sure you've heard that numerous times.  why is the U.S.
letting this happen?  why won''t the U.S. pressure pakistan to look into
these madrassas??  hint - Unocal and their dependance on Pakistani
cooperation.

Arafat a terrorist?  in who's eyes?  connie chung?
Pres. Bush's actions are simply in line with what is his admin's best
FINANCIAL interest.
Why doesn't Bush acknowledge the killing of 1000+ palestinians and the
destruction of their cities???
He's just as bad as Sharon.  Just look at the way Bush treats the
environment!  He's gets rid of environmental protection policies for
corporate savings!  yeah, that morality for you!!!!
