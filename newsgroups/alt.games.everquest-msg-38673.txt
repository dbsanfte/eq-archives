I am starting to wonder is EQ can be stretched much further or if it has
reached the limits of its creative potential.  SOL while offering cosmetic
changes offers nothing really new, just more of the same and a new character
class that is stuck within the same parameters as the old one.  Beast
Masters will likely become the new monks, fully twinked and power leveling
like mad to reach the high levels of their prior characters.  I look forward
to seeing newbie Beast Masters in Fungi tunics and sporting lvl 50 weapons
within a week or SOL reaching the stores. Other than that I doubt much will
change and certainly nothing of substance will be added.
