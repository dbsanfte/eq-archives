My guess is they don't understand how the bazaar works.  What they're
PROBABLY actually trying to sell is that STACK of silks for 50p.  It's not
such a stupid mistake.  After all, when you click on the item to set the
price, you're clicking on a picture with a little <20> written in the corner
so I don't think it's insane to think that maybe the price you're setting is
for the STACK.

In fact, that's what I thought though I had the foresight to test if it's
working like I intended (using another account/computer).  It wasn't, so I
fixed it.  I'm going out on a limb and say that most people don't have
multiple accounts & computers so it might take them longer to get a clue.
