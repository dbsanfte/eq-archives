A caster having to wait for a rare drop uber spell is similar to a melee
waiting for a rare drop uber weapon.  Many of those spells have lesser
forms, or spells that perform similar functions to a lesser degree, this is
akin to a melee having a less uber weapon.

The only real difference is between the drop rate of those uber weapons and
the drop rate of those uber spells.  That's what Verant should look at.
