Primarily that you have never posted here before, and your very first
post was made specifically to attack someone.

In a credibility contest between you and Martin, Martin wins because
he's a regular participant with a long posting history, whereas you
are a completely new poster with an apparent axe to grind.

Since you've brought up the term "irrelevant", allow me to point out
that your message to Martin was utterly irrelevant regarding the
subject. Great, you hate Stasis. BFD. Venting your personal problem
has no bearing at all on the question of if a GM killed Tunare.

Under the circumstances, yes.

It's not just the number of posts, it's the quality as well. You're at
two and zero now.

>You keep appealing to argument ad hominem. How about telling me WHAT
>was inaccurate, misleading or less than credible about my post? 

Argument ad hominem is exactly what YOU are doing when you attack
Martin because of his guild affiliation rather than actually
addressing any of his points.

>You are obviously trying to defend Sensei.

Hardly. I'm simply pointing out that your statements aren't in the
least bit valid to counter anything Martin has to say.

>My agenda is straightforward -- I dislike Stasis for what they did to
>the Calendar and Rotations. What is yours?

Mine is straightforward, too - I don't like bullshit.
