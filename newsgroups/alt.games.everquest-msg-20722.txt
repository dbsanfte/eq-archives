I'm something of a prude, but you aren't in my KF... Why?  well for the
same reason as I don't behave as if I'm offended if I see people
drinking at a bar, or even in most states smoking.  I don't behave in a
shocked or disturbed manner when marines or Usenet users Curse.  Its
like breathing or eating.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
