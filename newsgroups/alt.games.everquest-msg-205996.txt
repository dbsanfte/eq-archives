I've just installed eq on my machine.  I have NO idea what to do now.
I do NOT have a credit card or bank account of any kind, I live by cash
alone. 

I bought an eq CD on ebay for $5 that supposedly came with 30 days free
play, there is a key printed on it.

I understand that I can buy a "gamecard" at a local game store.
But how can I *TRY* the game out for free (on those 30 free days) without
having either a credit card or without having to buy a gamecard?
I don't want to spend $40 plus dollars on a gamecard then decide that I
don't like the game or that it won't run on my system properly 
(Linux Mandrake 9.1 with Transgaming WineX 3.01)

So far it appears to work in that it went through the install to the point
where there is a screen with a frogman holding a sword and several options
to log in, configure, etc....

Any good suggestions please.  I don't want to dump money into something I
can't play or won't like.  I want to *try* it first...

Thanks...
