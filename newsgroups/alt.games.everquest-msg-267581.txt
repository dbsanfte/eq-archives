Same here.  There's also the matter of the journal replacing notes.  In EQ1,
I often had to write down notes, such as lists of things needed for a newbie
armor quest, and stuff like that.  I like to play with the lights out, so it
was hard to read those notes.  It is much less distracting to have the game
take the notes for me in a quest journal.
