Dont go to DL.
1. Its full of assholes.
2. Its really really boring.
3. There are much better places to go.


Crystal Caverns, if you have Velious. Do the geonid camp. These guys are the
sweetest camp at your level. They dont agro, they can be taken by a small
group or pair of 40s (I solo them at 45), they pop quite quickly, they drop
nice jewels, the xp bonus is nice in CC, and theres a bank and a shop (if
you can sneak or change faction with magic) in the dungeon. What more could
you ask for....now go!
