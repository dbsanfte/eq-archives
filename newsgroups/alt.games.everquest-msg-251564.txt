That is a very longstanding flaw with EQ of course. Roleplaying should
not be such an effort. But EQ and its players don't reward roleplaying
in any way. When behavior isn't positively reinforced it doesn't
continue.

 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
