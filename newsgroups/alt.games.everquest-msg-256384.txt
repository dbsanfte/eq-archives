Don't be fooled by Mythic's misrepresentation of the warden. In no way
shape or form is the Warden the formidable melee fighter they describe.
With the damage add spells available to both classes, a Warden will be
outmelee'd by a druid. Wardens are extremely popular in groups however,
due to their bubbles which provide damage absorbtion for the rest of the
group. I've known wardens that wanted to go to bed who the group
offered to let stand in camp afk for the night just to have the bubble
going.

As one of the 3 heal classes in Hib, the warden's heal spells also are
the worst in amount healed and power/hp ratios. The self haste is
unnoticable due to hidden caps on character attributes, and it drains
power (DAoC mana equivalent). I don't know if Mythic still has the team
leader system in place but I'd look for old team leader reports for a
more detailed report on the weakness of the Warden class before wasting
too much time on the class. Last time I played they were only regarded
as bubble bots by themselves or their peers.
