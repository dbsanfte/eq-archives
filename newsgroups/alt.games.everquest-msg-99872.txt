Allright, Ben, I'll bite. I've been playing since the day of release, and 
Hanrahan in particular since August '99, so we can leave the newbie 
bullshit safely aside.

When I hear that someone auctions for a port to GFay, I assume they know 
where the fuck they want to go, so I don't even bother to reply, since as 
a Druid I can't port to GFay. That the original poster assumed that 
someone who took their money for a port to GFay would deliver them to 
GFay hardly makes them the "slime of EQ".

Caveat Emptor? Yes, by all means, but that's no reason for unwarranted 
personal attacks on somebody for being unhappy at paying out the money 
(remember, the Druid didn't do it for free, so gratitude never enters the 
picture) for a port and then having to do the long, tedious and possibly 
dangerous run from BB to GFay.
