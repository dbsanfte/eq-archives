This is a good money maker. By 29th you can start running a taxi
service, but by 19th you will have self ports - you can get to pretty
much anywhere reasonably quickly so if your chosen hunting ground is
crowded, you can move somewhere else. It is therefore easy to check rare
spawns - you're needn't really stop others from getting items by farming
drops from rare spawns, since if a spawn is camped you can just port to
another one.

Add to that, if you make your druid a wood-elf or halfling, you get
cultural tailoring. Tailoring is one of the few tradeskills that
actually seem to make any money and be self funding, and cultural armour
gives you a way to skill up through the black hole of trivial levels
between quivers (115) and velious stuff (very high with lots of failures
- 200+ trivial levels)

Big money sink. You'll need to invest a *lot* of money before it becomes
profitable, although by level 12 (or 9 for a dark elf) you can start
doing Stein of Mogguk runs for cash. They sell for 100pp or so, helps if
you have a friend to TP you around to bring the quest time down to 30min
or so.

See (2), above. Noone buys banded these days since there is so much
floating around - it goes cheaply to the few untwinked newbies or it
goes to vendors, so you're not going to turn a profit until you can do
the high end stuff.

Well, yeah, that'd work, but do you want to play the game or do you want
to spend all day in EC tunnel like some Norrathian used-car dealer?

At low level, hunt wisps (7-9pp/GLS, 1pp/LS) and EC orcs (5pp or so/DF
belt)

Then move on to dervs and bandits that drop bronze and sashes (to turn
in for more cash and bronze).

Eventually, from about level 20 odd you should start getting loot that
actually makes a bit of money - things like gnolls outside Splitpaw drop
fine steel weapons that go to vendors for 5pp or so a pop.
