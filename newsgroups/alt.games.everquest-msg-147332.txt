}IS there actualy a bonus for having a full group, or is it just that you can
}take down more/ bigger mob's?   I have read that they give you a bonus for
}groups over 4, something like the dungen modifier. But i don't realy see it.

2 in group gives 104% exp or 52% per person 
3 in group gives 108% exp or 36% per person 
4 in group gives 112% exp or 28% per person 
5 in group gives 116% exp or 23.33% per person
6 in group gives 120% exp or 20% per person.
