Right...when messing around sometimes, it's still easy
to find blue/light blue-to-53 drachnids in the Dreadlands.
Solo, they're still sorta a pain because of a damage
shield + rogue damge equation :-).

So I pull 'em with my Mrylokar Gaunts.  90% of the time
it dispells the damage shield right off the bat, making
them easy kills (I mean, c'mon...they ARE rangers...
;-)  ).  Easy exp just running through a zone is always
nice especially solo.
