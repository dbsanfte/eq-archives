Game sounds or winamp/CD music? If music, then what?

My playlist contains: Metallica, System of a Down, Tool, Rage against the
Machine, Bad Religion, Keepsake, Ozzy Osbourne, and whatever CD music I add
to my playlist at the time, which usually is some type of very hard rock or
metal.

How about you?
