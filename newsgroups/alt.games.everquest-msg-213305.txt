Actually there is something along those lines already. IIRC, certain police
departments in Florida (and perhaps elsewhere) have altered the cars in their
K-9 (police dog) units, so that when the internal temps reach a certain level,
the windows all roll down, the horn sounds, and the lights start flashing.

Not saying that this would be good or bad for the auto industry to implement,
just that such a thing has already been invented to keep police dogs alive and
healthy.
