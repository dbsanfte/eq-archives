It works very well on my normal machine and my laptop.
There is a little lag in the city zones when it's busy but that doesn't 
really matter as you won't be fighting there. It seems to be lag free in 
the main fighting zones.

There seems to be very little wrong with it in things that really 
matter. There are bugs but nothing so far that stops it being fun.
And it's only been released for 5 or 6 days so it's a bit early to start 
   discussing how well they are going to be fixing bugs. Come back in 6 
months...
