Go to Trakanon's Teeth, hire or bring a tracker, kill froglok "hunter" and
"forager", loot the medallion pieces they drop, go see...  back to the
tracker, having him lead you to the red-con guy in southwest (I think)
corner of zone.  Give pieces, get key.

Forager and hunter are always level 45.  Most stuff in the zone is lower
than that.
