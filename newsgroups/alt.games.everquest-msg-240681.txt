Erm, I've seen a couple in HMVs round here - mainly because they tend not
to have such a high throughput as the actual games shops so things hang
about.

Get the download, its not like you can't donwload it anyway as I
understand the way the patcher works. You are not paying for the software
but for the account to linked to LoY. As such the download will be current
if big, and the CD out of date by now so you'll end up donwloading it in
the patcher anyways.
