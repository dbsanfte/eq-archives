I've never actually fought in that spot you mention, but I have had plenty
of solo adventures to draw from.

No you aren't slower with the boot lev up, but it seems like you are if you
kite in 3rd person.The illusion of perspective makes it LOOK like you are
going a bit slower.  And it doesn change pathing a bit. Mob pathing in EQ
sucks as a rule. Water, trees, stairs and basically anything that has an
affect on the Z axis will make for interesting times.

I'm sure you are getting some odd artifact of the pathing in there. If I
were you I'd change my route a bit or stop using the SS boots. No having
fought in that spot I can't really add more advice other than to suggest
using SoW potions for the next few levels until you get the 49 Selo.
Obviously you have money to burn if you bought Tboots for a bard. Using the
potions, you'll be faster than the Tboots.
