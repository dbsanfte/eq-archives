I guess I was lucky sorta. I only played a few months in summer of 2001 when I 
first subscribed, but then I cancelled cuz I was still addicted to Half-Life and 
I was in  school so I didn't have the time I would have liked. When I came back 
in July of this year my character was still there, however. He was only level 15 
or something and didn't have any special equipment, so it wouldn't have been a 
horrible loss. It was nice to just pick up where I left off though :)
