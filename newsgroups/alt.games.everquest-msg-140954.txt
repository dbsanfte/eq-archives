It's true!  I know, because I'm the official banker of Kerra Isle.  And 
I have *very* special interest rates.

And on a side note, I was very amused the other day.  I took a newb on a 
tour from Freeport to the Bazaar the other day to upgrade his bronze 
longsword to something non-laughable (he had 250pp saved - I was 
impressed, as *I* usually don't have that much saved - ooh, maybe I 
should have introduced him to tailoring >;)).  Anyway, I told him I'd 
meet him in West Freeport after I dropped some extra weight off at the 
bank and he said "oh no, I need to get my money from the bank anyway, 
I'll meet you there."  "Forget about it," I said, "there's a bank in the 
Bazaar."  "Yeah, but can I get my money from that bank?" .... "Uh... 
yeah.  You can get your money from any bank."  A few minutes while he 
pondered this and I lost some weight.  "So if I put my sheild in one 
bank, I can get it from any other bank?"

They're so cuuuuuute when they're little ^_^

And on a side side note, he did ask if there was any reason to keep his 
sheild (velium whoknowswhat shield that some kind soul had dropped on 
him when he was younger), and I had no idea.  He was a barbarian warrior 
and he had dual weild at that point.  I told him I didn't *think* it was 
a good idea to give up dual wield just to get a shield, but to put it in 
the bank to maybe twink a new char when he starts one.  Good advice?

Oh, and I just about killed him when he went and bought some BP he 
wanted that had 20AC and -4agi for 200pp when he could have had a 
something chitin for 20AC with *no* negative stats for 50pp if he'd done 
a simple search.  I'm fairly certain it was a woman playing the warrior 
because when I /bonked him and pointed out all the other nice things he 
could have gotten for less or the REALLY nice things he could have 
gotten for the same price, he said "I'm happy with what I got, let's 
go!"  /sigh :)
