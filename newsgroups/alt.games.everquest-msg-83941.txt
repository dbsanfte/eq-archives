Not sure if this is the reason. But a group I am a member of posted this
:-

following is from

I just got off the phone with Sony TS and have a few answers now.

1.) The increase in LD activity IS since the last patch last week and
appears to be affecting people with firewalls, especially those who 
don't
know they have them i.e. XP users, and those with DSL modems with built 
in
firewalls. The impact is in fact JUST since the last patch. Turning off
firewalls may help.


2.) The Error Code 1017, 1018 and extended Resynch time issues appear to 
be
bugs that came with the same patch and yes they DO extend resynch beyond 
a
minute to 45 min or more. The development team is working on it and will
likely do something in the next patch or an emergency patch. Aside from 
what
the GMs and Guides suggested there may be something else appocryphally 
that
works. If you were grouped when you went LD, the group should camp and
reform...that may speed up the resynch considerably.
