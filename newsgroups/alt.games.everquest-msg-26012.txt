Ah, and a letter from one of our readers who is what some might call the
"stereotypical" druid, (well, from a druid bashing perspective, anyway)
who has solo'd his way to port capability with no need of help from
others. Well, Dan has already pointed out several things of note, but
allow me to add a few others:

The higher you go in level and power, it has seemed to me that the mobs
go higher even *faster*. There are less and less mobs at each level that
you can solo *effectively* (i.e. without massive downtime or even dying)
than previously.  True, there are those among druids and Necros who
apparently can and have made it all the way to 60 soloing, but by then
the opportunities for what zones/mobs you will be able to handle alone
will likely be so stifleingly limited you may not enjoy the game as
much. You will likely be restricted to low blues (see below) and they
may get harder and harder to find.  And a ton of places will be strictly
"off limits". Without a big party, you're simply not going to go in and
live. (Well, not if you try to fight anything anyway.)

Next..... do you have any interest in getting your epic? Granted, I know
nothing about the Druid epic quest. For all I know, given Verant's love
affair with Druids, it's all stuff you forage in uninhabited areas. But
somehow I doubt it. Most of them require taking down mobs of *very* high
level. Not blues (as in the paragraph above). You won't be able to solo
them. The one's I've read about also require trips to the planes.
(Though perhaps not all.) Going to to to the planes alone? Hrmmmm....

Guilds also offer the opportunity to learn good group skills which you
have missed out on soloing your way up. As well as interaction with the
other people playing the game, many of whom can help you in the many
ways Dan pointed out in his response. And........ (*gasp*) a chance for
you to help them too. Helping them, believe it or not, can sometimes be
as rewarding as helping yourself. Not to mention making them much more
likely to help you when you need that big uberitem some day. It's a
pretty nice setup, and what (as far as I can see) the game was designed
around.
