Except that unlike Severliiuosuoius, Zordak is doable by one group of 60s,
or two groups of 55+. And such group/groups would have something useful to
do to Skyfire (xp and spells). So it seems to me that instead of waiting for
the call to arms, a cleric waiting on Skyfire Zordak should get a few
friends to come hunt in Skyfire, and thus be already in zone when Zordak
spawns.

It's a BIT like Lodizal - a pure race to enage - EXCEPT that there's
something useful to do while you wait.
