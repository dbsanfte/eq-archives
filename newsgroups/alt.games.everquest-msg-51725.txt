The town has grown a lot. (Not that it is any better hehe). Ming is
almost the geographic center of the town now. All of the growth has
been to the South and West. Most of the growth is from LA. People that
live in BKFLD and commute to LA (90minute drive). Totally insane if
you ask me.

We now have 2 Walmarts and a Target:Greatland. The natives are dancing
in the streets. heheheh

If my wife's whole family didn't live here, I'd move in a heartbeat.

:-)

Cheers
