It's the recast time that really bothers me. If it's resisted, or if I
have multiples to mez, that five second recast time feels like an
eternity.

I've pretty much ignored this line of spells, but this sounds like a
good use - kind of like a free Rune spell. I'll give this one some
serious consideration. On a side note, the one thing I really dislike
about the Rune spells is that you don't automatically stand up when a
mob is bashing on you.

Another good idea.

If you use it on every fight, how do you know it makes a difference :)

Casters Realm says that Fascination will effect four mobs max. I don't
have this spell yet so I can't confirm if this is true. Can someone
confirm for certain that it can effect more than four mobs?

Even if there is no maximum, is the twelve extra seconds worth the 130
more mana over Mesmerization (16th AoE mez)? Actually, if there is no
max, sounds to me like it would be :).

Thanks for your thoughts. Very enlightening.
