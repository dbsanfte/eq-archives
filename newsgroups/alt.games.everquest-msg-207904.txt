Frontier Mountains: there's something I forget the name of that is on top of
one of the mountains.

Plane of Knowledge: the book that's part of the quest that starts off the
Beginner's Manual quests is ground spawn in the library.

Cobalt Scar: I was goofing off sending an Eye of Tallon into the water, and
saw something that looked like it was probably ground spawn.

Oasis, Lake Rathe, Neriak, Lower Guk, Highpass, Erud's Crossing, Unrest,
Everfrost, Qeynos Aqueducts, Dagnar's Cauldron: spokes of Tarton's Wheel
(for the Staff of the Wheel quest).

Most of the original cities: old silver coins (for an Enchanter quest).
