Continuing my epic tale of my first planes raid..

Everyone starts porting out, or getting translocates from the one wizard.
Myself and a warrior were going to Emerald Jungle to camp so we'd be close
to Sebilis for the raid that was starting at 11 am. The wizard couldn't TL
there, so we waited around to the end. At that point it was me, the 57
warrior, 60 monk, 56-ish wizard and the 58 necro raid leader (and guild
leader). The leader was waiting to be last to make sure everyone got out
before he gated out. The wizard asked us where we wanted to go.. the monk
wanted Wakening Lands, and we were EJ. The wizard says "Okay, WL coming"
up.. I'm thinking.. hmmm.. isn't that someplace that you need a KEY to port
to? The wizard is casting and lo and behold, a message comes up that I don't
have the right key to port to DL... and I'm LEFT BEHIND. So is the 57
warrior. So, there's the three of us standing there.. in Hate.. with 2 out
of 3 of us unable to get out. DOH!!!  Talk about a sinking feeling... the
wizard has to go buy another gem so he can port back up.

While we are waiting, the leader says we need to move back to the camp
closest to the zone in point. We don't get very far before the warrior gets
aggroed. And, boy, once you get aggroed, the other mobs come running. We run
back to where we were - the leader tells us to camp as he is running around
with five mobs on him. He was toast. The warrior and I camp. I wasn't sure
if I was supposed to come back in, so I did. I immediately get aggroed by
some giant rat hitting me for 150 a pop. Stupid me thinks I can camp while
getting hit (it's nearly 4 am at this point, so I'm not exactly thinking
straight). I FD at 2 bubbles of health.. no problem right? Well, I'm
poisoned.. and it's a damn strong poison. I can't get back up because I'd
get aggroed, I can't camp, I die from the poison.

Rut Ro!

I show up naked at the bank in Thurgadin and much discussion ensues about
what to do. Thankfully, I was still 46 and would be able to zone back in to
Hate. The leader petitions for help, but we didn't think we would get any
(especially that time of the AM!). Much discussion ensues about how we can
get out of this pickle. I think we had decided to zone back in, do the necro
summon corpse and get the h*ll out. It was getting near to the 8 hour spawn
time as well. I'm in Thurgadin and the wizard comes to pick me up. I zone
out of Thurgadin.. into Hate. Watch that first step, it's a doozy! lol

Turns out the GM took pity on us.. he summoned us up to a relatively safe
area, and had our corpses waiting for us. Summoned the warrior who was still
alive. Gave us experience rezzes!  Woot!  Then he deposited us back in SRO.
I was amazed.. I would have expected him to say that it was our problem to
get out. Whew!!  I know I'll never say anything bad about EQ customer
service!

So, we made our say to EJ and then to Sebilis where we have a guild "raid"
this morning.. sleep, who needs sleep? :-)
