    I did a stupid thing the other night.  I got invited to a PoG raid, and
being as I'd never been to a plane before I thought kewl, I'll go.
However, it just destroyed my faction.  I'm a High elf Cleric that worshipes
Tunare.  I know.. next time check what factions you're going to destroy
before you go...
    I've found a way to raise all the factions I've lost except Protectors
of Growth and Servants of Tunare, any suggestions or am I SoL?
