My Dex is 150 something atm, which means I probably have some room to reduce
it for improved stamina perhaps? My chest slot is a Ry'gor Battlemail so tht
buffs up my strength a bit.

This is the link for alla -
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7165

It's seems pretty good (ratio of 12/24) and only cost me 200pp in the bazaar
the other day. I never realised how tough it is to get high damage piercers,
they all seem to be WAR, SHM or SHD only.

I've got a Glowing Black Sword actually, and I do equip it occassionally. I
have a Centi Shortsword so I don't think I will use my GBS till I have an
item that procs in my primary, the +20 Dex would come in handy then I bet.
Locustlure doesn't proc for ages I heard but I got it cheap with the
Vambraces so it's my 'show off item' (please don't laugh ;)). I have to have
these pleasures sometimes and if someone inspects me then I don't look like
such a loser (there appears to be a lot of snobbery amongst Rogues, possibly
because most people play them as alternates?).

Ah, rats :( Looks like the search continues then...
