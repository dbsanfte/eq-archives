Yepp at 19 you own the place lol, not to be taken to serious though,
almost all mobs will kill you fast, the only exception is the lvl 3 -
6 or so snowbunnys :)

Brought my lvl 10 chanter there to work on jewelcraft, same store
sells both silverbars and stones, in neriak i had to zone twice to get
more, and my lvl 30 necro is here to so he can finance a bit :)

Also in EW the canyon that leeds to the zone line to GD is rather easy
to miss, you will see that if you go there and it's snowing, you can
basically see a few feet infront of you, but if you are good at using
/loc and  have a map should be no problem, i usually use the giant
fortress as a reference mark, get behind it (from the entrance) then
go west.

OHH a warning, don't get into exploring mode there, inside that
fortress is a not so friendly kromrif elite that see's trough invis,
or at least hide/sneak on my rogue, got hit for 145 and died :(
was lvl 3 at the time and had like 62hp :)

/Regards Berth
