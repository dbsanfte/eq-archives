If that's the case then it's too bad I shelved my rogue at 40.  You would
think if they were that needed that bad, guilds would spend a little more
time helping it's rogue members to get the exp they need to reach the level
it takes to be really useful. My experience as a rogue was pretty much
"you're on you're own kid".  Considering that a rogue is probably the MOST
group dependent class in the game it's pretty hard to level without help and
support of others.  I had to beg my guild to go with them to LGuk to get a
Mask of Deception.  They grudgingly allowed me to go.

60 level rogues don't fall off trees, they have to be played to that level
and it isn't easy.  A lot of people have negative attitudes toward rogues
but most are simply indifferent.  A rogue is rarely perceived as being
needed in a group (at least prior to high-level raiding) and are almost
always passed over for a tank, cleric or chanter.  Rogues need more skills
that will give them the ability to solo or make them more useful to groups.
Will they ever get them? Probably not.
