I have an erudite necro with agility of 70, which with certain flayed skin
pieces jumps to 76.  If I unequip a piece of armor and my agi drops below
75, my AC drops a lot (too much to be explained by losing the AC on that
particular piece of armor).  So, in effect, reaching the threshhold of 75
agi just takes away an AC penalty.  Hope my example makes as much sense to
everyone else as it does to me  :-)
