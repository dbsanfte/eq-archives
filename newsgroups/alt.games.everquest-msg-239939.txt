As of last October, when I started leveling my shadow knight, I started
out in hometown newbie zone, then moved to paludal, with no problems
finding a group.  Often they're sitting at the zone in waiting to form
even.  After leveling up to about 21 or 22, I moved to the overthere. 
There were not as many people in the overthere as there were earlier in
the year when I was leveling my cleric, however, I still ended up
getting groups.  Moved to Dreadlands afterwards, with same scenerio, no
problem getting groups, and plenty of people in the zone.  Went to
Velks after that, and then off to the planes.  

Oh yeah, I also went out to highhold keep about a month ago and saw
about 30 people in the zone.

I think most people just hit up the best zones to get exp in, and dont
adventure around much to the less deseriable zones.

Funny thing.  Now that I'm 65, I find that I wait a lot longer for
groups, kinda ironic huh?
