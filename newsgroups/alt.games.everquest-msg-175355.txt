I think SWG looks like it's going to be great.  I think it will be good
because it's by the same developers (sort of) as EQ, but years later with a
lot more experience under their belts.  It looks to me like there is enough
to enjoy without the "uber grind" and a chance for people to develop
characters and abilities in a lot of creative ways.

I've been hearing about it for a long time and didn't really consider
playing it because I was quite hooked on EQ, but lately the aura is fading
and a lot of my friends are not playing anymore, or very little so I'm ready
to check out something new.

A lot of the aspects of the game are the exact things that I've often
thought would be great in EQ.  I love the idea of tradeskills being more
interactive in the game and more creative and the idea of being a merchant.
Might not interest everyone but I used to play a console game where that's
all I did and I loved it.

I'm looking forward to playing I just have to get a bigger hard drive first.
