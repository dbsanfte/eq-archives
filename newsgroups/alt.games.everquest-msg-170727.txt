I have both the 9 and 10 slots set on automatic (use whenever I hit left arrow
or right arrow, respectively).. and then on different characters I put
different things in those slots

Default is sense heading in both boxes (hey, thats twice as much chance I'll be
using the ability) until the skill is maxed out, at which point it becomes
useless.

Characters with Forage often dump one of the boxes to Forage on most pages.

I made one of the boxes on my 5 year old's monk auto mend.  Sure, it means he
doesn't have tactical control of mend, to hold and use when absolutely
needed... but my experience tells me that at low levels, mend works so seldom,
and for so little, that its much better to set up to use every time its
available as soon as its available... cause what really matters is skill ups.

My bard currently has Detect Traps on one box, as an overlooked skill.  When
that maxes out (maybe it already has) I'll put Remove Traps there or
something.  Forage stays in the other slot because... well cats eat a LOT you
know.  And you never know what you might stumble across in some strange zone.

My cleric has my number 10 inventory slot chained to both boxes, normally I put
cheap food there to protect my misty thicket picnics (force feeding every time
I can, without thinking about it), but on certain targets I swap in a spyglass
for a buff slot one dispell protector.  This means that as long as I make a
point of spinning around a bit in place while fighting, I'm chain clicking the
insta buff to keep replacing it.  I'm considering putting my bridle in one of
the boxes, though, on at least one page, for easy spell icon refreshing.

Any other clever uses for autokeying?
