LCD response times are more complicated than a single number can 
indicate.  For example, on one kind of display (there are three 
different kinds of LCD panel commonly available), going from full black 
to full white or from full white to full black is *faster* than going 
from black or white to grey.  So, even if a full transition is 16 ms, 
the transition to grey (which is much more important for most games) 
might take a lot longer.  That panel will be quoted as being 16 ms, of 
course.

Because there are three different kinds of panels, you can't really 
compare the single quoted response number between two displays, unless 
you know they are the same type.  Something that looks good at 25 ms on 
one type might suck at 16 ms on another type, only being matched by 12 
ms panels of that second type.

These issues, and others important to gaming, are covered quite well in 
this article:
