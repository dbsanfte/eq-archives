Not at all.

So, the constant flow of bear cubs, goblin whelps, spiderlings, white
wolves, decaying skeles, and gnoll pups for lvl 1-3 right there near
the guards isn't a good thing, you're right. Goblin scouts along with
those will get you to 6. The gnoll guards outside BB will get you to
about 8, more if you stick with them. Or you can hunt the surface of
BB as well. After 8, go out to the tundra and hit some of the orc
troopers, polar bears, and leapords.

Then, as was mentioned, there are the quests in the region...

Feerrott? A "great starting area"? Now that is funny...
