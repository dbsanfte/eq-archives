You'd spend a LOT less time and effort killing enough mobs to make
300p and buy one.  Use /who to find enchanters level 16 - 25 and start
sending tells.  In fact if you just port them around to do the quest
I'm sure they'd give you a big discount.  Hell, you can even do most
of the quest yourself (which it sounds like you have already), and
multiquest the second-last step with the enchanter giving the nut last
(you can even go get the nut yourself, and give it to the enchanter to
hand in), so he gets the book, and then it's just a quick trip to
Oggok.

Hey, it worked for me.
