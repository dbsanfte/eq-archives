Getting ready to go look up and print out the shaman epic for my wizard
to do as much of it as can be done (assuming *any* of it can be done by
an Erudite wizard) and looking for insight from anybody who may have
walked this path.

A recent patch buggered up the wizard epic again (as I mentioned in
another thread) and for a safety margin there's a bunch of us looking
for any and all postive hits to Truespirit faction that we can find.
Shammy epic quests seem to be a likely starting point. So, with that in
mind...

Have any of you done any of these quests as a non-shammy?

Assuming it can be done, do you still get Truespirit faction hits off of
completing them?

Any other quests jump to mind that give positive Truespirit hits?

head every 15 minutes. Over all, it's certainly less painful, and very
probably more productive."
