He said in that post about needing help to surprise his son that if he
could get some help with that, he'd knock off the flaming twit act
forever... and he seems to have stuck with it.

And it was Getsumj who came first. Pocket avenger came flying in on a
holy crusade of twitness after that. And I guess he *still* hasn't
learned that nobody is going to take any of his attempted serious
posts seriously as long as he devotes so much time to calling everyone
else pussies and other pretty things.
