Kindly go fuck yourself, asshole.

Do you realize what a jackass you just made of yourself,
denouncing people who overgeneralize the residents of a
region, then immediately following that up by doing exactly the
same thing yourself regarding the residents of Texas?

Go join the pro-nuking yahoos, son, you're two peas in a pod.

I've lived in Texas since 1980, and I'm damned proud of
the overall level of education and general common sense here,
especially compared to the sort of self-congratulatory
"aren't we so enlightened" ignorance that is all too common
on the east and west coasts.

If you hate it here so much, why don't you move out and
improve the average IQ of the state?
