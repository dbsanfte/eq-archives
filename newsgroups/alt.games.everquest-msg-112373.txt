OK, guess I'm doomed to have crappy music. I run a SB live card and my
OS is Win2k.  My system originally shipped with ME and with all the
hype about the OS for multimedia, games, etc, I thought it was going
to be great. It wasn't. I was fighting constant hangs and blue
screens, that's why I went to 2000.  Been running it for a long time
and have no reliability issues at all now..........just crappy music
with EQ.   I really don't want to go back to ME !!!
