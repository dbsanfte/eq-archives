If the person is still (or back) in the zone, "/target name" can
get confused, but "/target Joebob's corpse0" always works
correctly.

Or if Joebob has a ton of corpses, use "corpse1", "corpse2", etc.
as appropriate.

I learned this from a friend who Guides, they have to do that
a lot to determine which corpses are really "lost" and which
the player can/should really get himself.
