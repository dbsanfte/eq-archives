Oh, please.  The US notes there was no such activity.  Israel
does not claim there was such activity.  You are grasping at
straws to make the claim that such is the case, and it is 
pretty specious to make the "well, we don't really know -- both
the US and Israel might be lying" claim in order to keep
open the possibility.

No.  Everything everywhere has the "potential" to be a threat.
That doesn't mean that it's OK to kill everyone everywhere
and destroy everything everywhere on the off chance that it
might maybe be doing something that perhaps could be something
one doesn't like.

You still fail to make the distinction between a legitimate
target and a legitimate attack.  They are different animals.
Even when something is a legitimate target, that does not
justify atrocity in the execution of a miltary action.


For instance, let us assume that the Liberty *were* a
valid target.  The skipper of the Liberty attempted to
surrender.  The Israelis refused to accept or acknowledge
the surrender, and instead chose to attempt to murder 
every single person.

All the blather about "logical" targets does not excuse
the murder of sailors in the water, and repeating
ad nauseum that you consider the Liberty a valid target
does not address this.

Let us assume that the Liberty was a valid target.  Does
that excuse the refusal to accept surrender and the
massacre of sailors in the water?  Or are they "legitimate
targets," too?

Once again, you fail to make the distinction between
a legitimate target and a legitimate attack. The mere
fact that something makes logical sense to someone doesn't
justify it.

The fact that it is logistically easier to execute prisoners
than to house them does not justify executing prisoners.

Not everything can be sacrificed on the altar of expediency.

As far as I can see, you do not accept anything as atrocity
as long as one can, however tenuously, make an argument
from expediency.

And to attempt to justify the atrocity committed by the Israelis
merely because one doesn't want to admit that they can do any
wrong is even worse.

I never called it terrorism.  I called it a war crime and an
atrocity.  That is what it was.

Taking in the mindset of the murderers at Mai Lai does not
justify the atrocities performed there.  You can't justify
mass murder on the ground that the murderer was having a
bad hair day.

Oh, please.  I was in the miliary also.  In the Army *I* served
in, we were told to take such things as international law and
crimes against humanity into account.

Well, no.  The US would be perfectly justified in telling the 
Russians to leave.  The US would be perfectly justified in
seizing the LP.  However, the US would not be perfectly justified
in attacking the LP without warning and refusing to accept
surrender when offered.  The US would not be perfectly 
justified in rounding up the survivors, lining them up against
a wall, and executing them.

You say you are military.  If were in Afghanistan and
attacked a Russian LP on Russian territory, you would 
be out on your ass in a minute.  And rightly so.
