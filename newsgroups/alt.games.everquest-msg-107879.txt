It's not the plate arms, its priest arms, take a look at the druid and
shaman arms.

Rowyl's Vambraces of Nature (druid)
AC: +7 Wis: +2 Mana: +30
Utter poo.  There's a reason so many druids have blue arms (nathsar)

Rune Crafter's Vambraces (shaman)
AC: +16 Str: +1 Sta: +1 Dex: +1 Wis: +3 HP: +10
Mana: +15
More poo.

Vambraces of Forbidden Rites (cleric)
AC: +19 Dex: +3 Wis: +2 HP: +35
/nod poo.  Other than the usefulness of the hp for absorbing AoEs and
modrods. (think more like a necro where hp isn't just how much you can get
hit)


The bard, paladin and SK arms are actually pretty decent, warrior arms are
better than cobalt if you don't factor the click effect on cobalt (lesser
shielding), but in that case just keep both and swap the cobalt in for the
click.
