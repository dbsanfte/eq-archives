Fizzlethorpe ale-swilling Bristlebane!  It's a fucking Warder, of
course they're going to get wiped out.  Not everything in the game is
designed to be done by a single 6-man group.  I saw less than 12 PCs
there, so even if they are wearing the absolutely best gear, they're
not going to be able to do much against any Velious dragon other than
WW.  There are other ways to organize 30-40 PCs besides a Zergling
rush, even on mobs that can't be slowed.
Just because something can't be soloed doesn't mean that it requires a
zergling rush.
