I played for the first time in PoN today and realized how much I love LDoN.
Joined up - puller had to go afk after about 20 minutes.  Then he left and a
ranger joined us to pull.  He then went afk for about 15 minutes.  Then the
druid logged off so his sister could play.   I was bored to tears. 
Loot was FFA - which I hate.  We did roll on the gems, and there was a nice
drop item but I couldn't use it.  Didn't win the roll on any of the gems.  (How
*is* cash loot up there anyway???)
I did gain a yellow and a half - level 53 cleric - but was too much of a time
sink and not profitable enough to do it often.
