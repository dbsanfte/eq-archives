Here's what I know. I recently purchased a Dell with a Pentium 4 Centrino 
(not Celeron) package running at 1.6GHz. It has 1.5GB of DDR2 RAM and an 
ATI Mobile Radeon Xpress 300 graphics "card" with 32MB of video ram. EQ 
with all graphics settings set to minimum is unplayable. It's like the 
entire game is running in slow motion. I think the weak link is the 
graphics subsystem. The Radeon X200 and X300, though PCI express, are most 
certainly *not* designed for gaming.

Now, some four or five years ago I purchased a Toshiba Satellite with a 
Pentium 4 M(obile) 1.7GHz processor, 1GB of DDR RAM and a GeForce 2 Go 
graphics processor with 64MB of video memory. It always ran EQ on minimal 
settings with very little trouble - well, up until a year or so ago, when I 
fell victim to the dreaded GeForce 2 Go PCB defect, and it stopped working.

Whatever you do, if you don't go with a "gaming" graphics processor (and 
this doesn't necessarily mean expensive - just something better than the 
Intel or Radeon Xxxx Express offerings), you may as well give up on the 
idea of playing much EQ or other worthwhile games on it.

My 2cp.
