Are the replacement bags tradeable?  Can you put them in the "share" slot?

How many slots do they have?

Are there different ones; a four slot and so on?

Depending on how these questions are answered, it should be possible to 
fill up all your slots with bags with the creation of a single low level 
mage and some juggling.

Then again, you can just buy trader bags at the bazaar, which make a 
really good place to put your sellable loot in the bank, convenient for 
when you want to go "vendor"
