A few weeks ago I was thinking along these lines and remembering how much
fun it was to get a mob drop that was an upgrade, and how difficult that
was with the gear I had purchased at Bazaar and on merchants. So I decided
for my next char, I would only accept gear I could farm, tradeskill, or
quest. And only buffs from folks I was xping with.

... And so that's what I've been doing with my new iksar monk. It's
been a ton of fun looting stuff that's a snazzy upgrade. Camping for iksar
bandit mask, explorer lockets, bogling mallet, fist of wood, horns of
spirits, loda kai earrings, chialle's friendship ring... We even scored a
Forest Loop the other night! And instead of "yawn, more vendor trash" it's
"ooh, score, gimme that mallet and add my Club to the sell pile!"

But I was quite able to tank in my first LDON, even with 2 7/30 weapons
and fully kitted in cured silk, so I guess being twinked isn't all it's
cracked up to be.

Now, there were some sticky spots: finding a Polished Steel Ulak on a
vendor for 2pp -- but I reluctantly passed it up when I realized that I
wouldn't find anything even close on my own for another 30 levels. And
the joy of upgrading from the fallen bodies of my foes since then has
more than made up for it.

The only other issue for me has been tribute points. It wasn't that hard
to rack them up (got 1300 or so laying around right now). And at level 20
I can get worn item haste 21% and regen II for 10pts/10mins.  From all
I've read, I wouldn't expect to get anything this good on my own until I'm
level 40+. Not that camping rare, grossly underconned mobs for their rare
drop is my idea of fun, but I really don't see myself bothering after a
worn haste item any time soon. :/

It's too bad you're not on Xev. Sounds like we'd have fun hunting together.
