My vote for "Would most like to see his head stuffed and mounted on my wall"
is that Dark Elf Dragoon in WC.  Looks like a player character....until he
runs right up to you, rips out your kidney, and forces it down your throat.
In less than ten minutes, he had wipped out over a weeks worth of
hard-earned xp back when my cleric was 16th lvl.

Most people would like to get revenge against Dorn in NRo, but he accidently
saved my life one night on a PvP server when I was in very deep do-do....so
I actually am a bit grateful toward him.  He still hates me, though :-)
