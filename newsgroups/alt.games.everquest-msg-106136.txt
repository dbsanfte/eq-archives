Cyndreela by the Fear portal in Feerrott.  She spawns every
5 minutes like clockwork.  Bring whatever Magic Resist gear
you can, or she'll Fear you a lot.

Gornit in Ocean of Tears (hill giant).  Every six minutes.
Good loot, although he may be starting to go light blue at 52.

Lower Guk, undead frogs.

Bats in the back side of Sol B (come in through the SE
side of the goblin castle area of Sol A).

Tower of Frozen Shadow, 6th floor.  But getting there
solo can be a bitch.

Katta Castellum graveyard might be blue to you at 52.
