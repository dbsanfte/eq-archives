Ads at the movies are nothing to do with 'monopolies', except maybe in 
the context of the local cinema having a monopoly.  And do people 
'hate' them?  I don't think so.  They're more the sort of thing that 
people like to moan about.

It doesn't require Gatesian mounds of lucre.  Plenty of businesses 
compete in industries with much greater startup costs.

And DOES Rupert Murdoch own them all?  I think not.  (And if he did, I 
should think that it wouldn't be hard to get funding for an alternative 
- imagine the popularity of a single channel that was outside such a 
monopoly.)

That will happen.
