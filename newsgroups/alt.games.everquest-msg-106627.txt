why i quit playing my enchanter at level 16 and started a warrior all
those months ago.  But to give myself a break from the warrior, i
bought myself gear, reequipped myself with a few k worth of gear.
Head to HHP first, try for 10 minutes to get a group, no luck.  three
people ask for breeze though.

go to oasis, same deal, noone invites me to their group, but plenty of
"can you breeze me at docks / orc alley / shore / gypsy camp / etc."

ok, fine, i knew oasis was bad as far as intelligence goes....so i
decide to try unrest, no luck, and amazingly noone asked for breeze.
so i go to crushbone, and again, no offers for groups, but plenty of
people asking for breeze.  

Fine....I hopped the boat to kunark and headed for ill omen, figuring
there will be plenty of people there.  well i was right on that, but
still not able to get a group.  finally i get a tell, and this is what
transpires:

You say out of character: Level 16 enchanter LFG.
Milochytin tells you: u may join us at front door

so i think, hmm, 16 seems a bit low for the front door, but whatever.
so i head over there.  I join the group, and i get....

Arkenstone: Haste plz
Arkenstone: and breeze too
Milochytin: breeze plz

so i haste the two melees that were sittin there, tried to breeze
milo, but he already had clarity.  *sigh*   then, this:

Milochytin: lvl and class
Me: 16 chanter
Milochytin: wo  16???
Milochytin: too low, sorry
Fizldorf: yea that 16 is too low
Arkenstone: soory 2 low
Arkenstone: can you redo my haste
Me: You are the ones that invited me and told me to come over here
You have been removed from the group.

You have added Milochytin to your IGNORE list.
You have added Arkenstone to your IGNORE list.
You have added Fizldorf to your IGNORE list.

You say out of character: Level 16, thats SIXTEEN, enchanter looking
for group.
You are now looking for a group.

thats the straw that breaks the camels back...inviting me into your
group, having me buff you, and then kicking me out, right after asking
me to REBUFF you.  people can be such asses.  back to the warrior, so
i can just sit there and bash on stuff and not worry about it.
