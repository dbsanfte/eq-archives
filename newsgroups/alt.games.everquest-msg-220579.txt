I know I do this,and I'm sure a lot of you do it as well.When I get a new
weapon or piece of armor I switch views and spin around to "check my self
out".I think they should make a command like /pose that will control the
camera and have you do a few moves like in the character selection screen.
Just finish my newbie armor quest and it came to me. I know its silly and
has no real function "in game" but I'd use it for sure.
