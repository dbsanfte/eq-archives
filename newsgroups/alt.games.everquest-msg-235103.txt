I think I'd hold off spending 15AAs on run5. Only report I've seen of
run4 wasn't impressive, no noticeable difference to run3. Some of the
AAs appear to be broke (don't get Spirit Call 4 if you're a shaman) so
it's probably best just to hold off and wait a bit. 

Given some of the ooc chatter we heard last night, there's no
guarantee that Run5, even at sow speed, will be all that useful in
GoD. Druids where whining that some snared mobs were running at sow
speed, casters were shadow stepping, trash mobs in one zone we visited
hit for over 1000.....  It's probably gonna take a while for people to
figure out the zones and decide what AAs are useful and which ones
aren't.
