For me, as a cleric, it is also a problem I have. I stand there, not moved
for the past hour, and I get the message: Your spell has been interrupted.
This doesn't happen on old world zones, just on that blasted moon. Also,
another oddity: When I buff, I buff myself, then my friend, to keep an eye
on when the buffs drop... Yet his drops nearly a minute before my own does!
This will happen when we have both been in the same zones all evenings...
