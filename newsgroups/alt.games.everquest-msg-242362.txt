Ok here goes some may care to add other things, or change what I have
written:

Question:  Other players tell me I can use a different User Interface
(UI) to the one that comes with Everquest what do they do?

Answer:  The UI that comes with Everquest has been changed over the
years to reflect in-game changes.  Thousands of players use the default
user interface but many have chosen to either write their own or use
the clever UIs written by other people.

The largest collection of UIs for Everquest is held on:
<http://www.eqinterface.com/>
You will have to logon to get the new UIs but it is free.

Once on this site you will see that there are a number of complete UIs
which change all of the parts of your Everquest world to a specific
theme.  Other areas give you the ability to load smaller map windows,
tailored items for specific classes, maps for zones and even the
ability to drag recipes and spell lists up in your storyline option on
screen.


Question:  How do I get the UI I have downloaded to work in Everquest?

Answer:  In your Everquest folder which can been seen in Windows
Explorer there are a number of sub-folders.  If you are changing your
complete UI go to your "uifiles" folder.  You will see one folder there
called "default".  This contains your stock standard interface you see
on the screen if you have no other UI loaded.  LEAVE THIS FOLDER ALONE
AND MAKE NO CHANGES TO IT.  Under the "uifiles" folder create a new
folder named "me" (it can be called anything but simple is good in this
case.  Unload your downloaded new UI files into the "me" folder.  In
game you will start out with the stock standard UI provided by SOE.  In
your chat window type
/loadskin me
and hit enter.  For a few seconds your screen will stop and then appear
with your new UI loaded.  You will have to re-arrange the screen to
suit your style of play.

Some UIs such as spell lists or maps which can be downloaded from here:
<http://www.mapfiend.net/>
require their own folders or can be downloaded straight into existing
folders.  For example the maps mentioned above are downloaded straight
into your "maps" folder under the main "Everquest" folder.  Spells and
trade skills normally appear under the storyline button in game and you
guessed it will be under the "storyline" folder in your "Everquest"
main folder.

Each of the UIs normally carry instructions for their use, either on
the web site or in readme files.

Question:  I play a warrior and do not need a caster or mana bar with
my character how can I change this?

Answer:  Most of the complete UI sets include modifications for
specific classes.  For example, there are manaless bars for warriors,
new tracking interfaces for druids and rangers the list is endless.  If
you are happy with the general theme you are using use the instructions
as above except to create a specific warrior UI make another folder in
the "uifiles" folder.  Call this folder "warrior" (you can call it
anything, it could also be other class specific names such as "ranger"
whatever is applicable).  Copy all of the same files in your "me"
folder into the "warrior" folder and the additional class specific
files from the <http://www.eqinterface.com/> site.  In game, playing
your warrior, at the chat window type loadskin warrior and your new
files should appear without the mana and casting bars.  You can have as
many UI folders as you need to outfit the different classes you play in
game just ensure that they have all the base files in them first then
overwrite with your class specific files.

Question:  My UI does not work after the last patch what has happened?

Answer:  Sometimes SOE change the files for the way their own interface
operates.  Sites such as eqinterface will normally have files to add to
your custom UI after a patch.  Download the new file and overwrite the
file (s) in each of your custom UI folders.

Question:  I want to design and code my own UI how do I go about it?

Answer:  Sites such as <http://www.eq-toolbox.com/> give you the
necessary tools to do so.  Their forum area is also very good for
picking up hints on where to go. Most of the contributors to
eqinterface start out in eqtoolbox.
