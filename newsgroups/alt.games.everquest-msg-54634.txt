That is true, bizbee, it was me.  Take a joke.  I hope you found humor in
that post, but if you did not, can only hope I did not offend.

I also apologize if I did not follow Usenet protocol regarding subject
headers and excerpts.  I view threads in Outlook Express and have no trouble
keeping track of what message pertains to what.  However, your thoughtful
comment did cause me to realize that users of message viewers that do not
keep track of threads may become confused.  You yourself apparently were
bordering on being confused.

I have therefore considerately left the subject intact and included some of
your text inside my message in an attempt to clear up things for
easily-confused readers like you.
