Interested in obtaining (either via hunting or purchase) an item for my
warrior with a permanent effect of Enduring Breath.  Finding it harder
to search for items on the web based only on their effect.  Can anyone
reccomend some items that carry this property that I can either
hunt/quest for with my 39 warrior, or purchase, with either the
location/mob where it's found or a reasonable average price to auction
for to buy it?
  I have the sinking feeling (sorry...... bad pun) that most of the mobs
dropping such a thing are in damp places where I'll need EB, at least
the spell cast on me, to obtain them, no?
