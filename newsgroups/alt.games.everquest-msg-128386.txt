I have attack toggled to off permanently, did it so long ago that I forget
just how, but assist is far too useful to be made into an attack key in
my opinion.

I can only think of one way to always target the add.

/target maintank
/assist
/cast (charm)
/f8

Since the main mob is now charmed f8 will pick up the closest
other mob instead.  Of course now noone can attack the MA's
selection, and once charm breaks you've put yourself at number
one on the real target's to do list...oh, and I don't think you can
actually write /f8 in a macro, can you?

I if both mobs are named the same I generally use f8 or mouse
clicks and keep looking for the undamaged one of the pair.  DS
makes this suck.  Another solution would be to Brell with selecting
the correct target, AOE mez both.  Don't worry, your MA will
rapidly break the mez on the real target.
