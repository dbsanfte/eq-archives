Just to clarify, I wasn't calling anybody here any kind of name. I've been a
lurker for a week or so, and you all seem to be people of an intelligent,
rational nature. I was using the term to say what somebody WOULD be if they
petitioned a GM about a name somebody's had for 34 levels on the only
character they play. Plus, isn't that lame-ass "smiley" emoticon thing
supposed to imply that there is no harm intended? Anyway, I formally
apologize to anybody I may have offended. Woot.
