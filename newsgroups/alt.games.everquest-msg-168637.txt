Not 100% sure yet, but I think I found the solution.  Tried turning the
sound off completely in the game and played for about 3 hours in the early
morning in DL and never saw the lag once.  Now yes, this is a downtime for
the game, but still.

My Video Card and Sound Card share the same IRQ and for some bizarre reason,
Win XP won't let me change the settings.  But the way I figure it is the
game is trying to access both at the same time and during high traffic
(sound and tons of people/creatures on the screen) it causes a conflict that
the computer never really recovers from.  Oddly I can still use WinAMP in
the background while I play and have no problem.

Tomorrow will be the real test when I play on a bit more peak hours, but
really think I may have found it this time.

Thanks for everyone's help.
