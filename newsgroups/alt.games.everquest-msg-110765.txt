Hm. One example: The original progroms on Jewish communities in Russia 
involved only a few dozen deaths, and yet they caused a huge uproar (and 
are remembered to this day). These days, they would hardly make 
headlines. Another example: Jack the Ripper... Total tally: 8 victims. 
These days, a serial killer who kills 8 people would be in the news for 
about a week, and then dissapear entirely from the public consciousness. 
Murder appears to be infinitely more commonplace these days than it was 
under, say, Queen Victoria. 

While I agree that society has improved a lot since then (there is a lot 
less sexual hypocrisy, for one thing, and the separation of Church and 
State has come a long way), in some respects we are worse off.
