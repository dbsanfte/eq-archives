The "textbook" answer is.......... they can't. Supposedly Verant will not
move characters between accounts, nor will they move them from one server
to another except in the event of a server split and move log.
   Having said that, there have been times when *allegedly* (cough...
cough) VI had a policy in place that when a new account was created for a
family member at the same address, same credit card, etc. that they would
move *one* character to the new account on the assumption that it was two
family members who wanted to play together, and would now be paying two
monthly fees. I never saw that documented anyplace, but there's one person
in our guild playing a character she says was moved in such a fashion when
her account was started up as a second account, the first one being her
son's.
  There is, AFAIK, no penalty *ever* imposed for asking a question,
particularly if done politely. The GM's certainly aren't going to be able
to help your friend out, but if they hop on the phone and talk to customer
service and politely ask, possibly mentioning that they heard some other
people had done it, who knows? They might get really lucky and get one
character moved over. But I wouldn't tell them to get their hopes up
either.
  Another thing to consider is, how long have they been playing and what
level are the characters? If they're in their teens or low twenties, it's
probably just as well to go start a new one over. If they've made it to
their 40's or 50's, perhaps more vigorous persuit of a resolution might be
justified.
