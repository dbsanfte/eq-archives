Ok some say ya stoned I say yes it could work. The showing off part
was the bard being naked, not the fact it was a bard.

I have to try very hard NOT to take agro, IF Im in melee range and IF
I play high agro songs like Charm, SoS or the like. Heh SoS, well
named song cant play it without getting killed. Ive taken agro
everytime I wanted and a lot I didnt, now it takes me a few twists but
I get it and keep it. 
Face it taunt is so broken my granny could get agro with a knitting
needle and bad grammer. 
Now think about a highly hasted bard with procing weapons and UNBUFFED
dex of 130 (maxed with buffs easy)  or higher constantly casting agro
songs (spells) every 4 seconds of the fight.

Now what the great unwashed doesnt see is that if a bard were allowed
to BUILD agro ( Like War SK or Pally does) then Im not sure anyone
short of a suicidal nuker could take it away. Course I will never
know, I have better things to do LoL.

Now hitpoints..well thats another issue isnt it. :)
Dont see a bard having more than 5k with buffs so thats pretty light.

So you may not be stoned but the bard who does this certainly may be.
