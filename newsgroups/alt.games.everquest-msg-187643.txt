I single'd them at 51.

Use a very low aggro spell.

The front 2 are closer to the middle
2 than the middle 2 are to the last
2.  As a result, a high enough aggro
pull will get both of the front and
the middle left one.  This is pulling
the right front.

However using Malise to pull (a very
low aggro resist debuff) got one every
time.  The common wisdom on the Magician's
Tower back then was pull the right one
first in each rank.

HTH :)

The unfortunate thing about the Hole
these days is how well known it is.
Used to be that it was 'nigh on deserted
most times.  XP there is among the
best of the pre-PoP zones.
