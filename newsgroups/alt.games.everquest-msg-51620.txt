Yup, I sure will.   But it'd be a lot easier for me to rally everyone I know
for one or two fights than a whole bunch of 'em.  I'm rarely on until after
11pm and not every day either.

"huge-group" fights down to something I can whittle away at with my guildies
and non-guidie friends or (who knows?) maybe even a great pickup group.
