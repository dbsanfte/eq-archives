It's what I saw in beta.   I certainly wasn't a griefer.  I can undstand
your love for PvP, I guess you can't understand my dislike of it.

It's what I saw in beta, one or two players griefing other realms.  You seem
to be confirming my experience with your (*).
 I'm glad everything is okay now though and the solo griefer has been
eleminated.  Oh wait, you just said the solo grifer hasn't been eleminated.

I must have been an idiot for sticking with EverQuest, I take it?

If that's your thing, enjoy.  I really like your (*) statements, it proves a
point for me.  Not that I saw those things you're describing in beta, I
didn't.

I don't play DAoC, I *played* it and didn't like it.
You're describing *I'm describing* the things about UO I hated, so of course
I don't like DAoC.

I've got a good idea of what grief play is, I suppose it fits your
description of good RvR, attacking the *idiots* that have pick-up groups
that aren't optimal.  It doesn't matter if it's two players as I described
or the one you're describing.  That's not the kind of game play I enjoy.

I enjoy EQ game play (High level pickup groups work even if they aren't
optimal) and I don't like DAoC game play (Non-optimal pickup groups do not
work).  YMMV.
