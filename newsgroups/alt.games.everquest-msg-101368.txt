A large number of the "class balance" changes to Paladins over
the past year or so have had the result of making them *much*
more efficient soloers.

For example, we've gotten self-only haste and self-only regen
buffs, which become moot in any group with any class that can
haste or heal or cast regen, but are remarkably useful while
soloing.

I don't know if that was the intent or not, but I can't
say I'm complaining.
