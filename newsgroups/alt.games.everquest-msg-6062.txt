Over crowding. Over camping. Farmers. Squabbling kids on all the other
"carebear servers" (look for definition below) Also I was looking for
more of a "realistic" game. It doesn't make sense how an evil god
worshipping ogre SK can raise faction in a human good god loving
city (ie. Freeport?)

What is really funny is how people think it is a "good time" to
wait in line, with their group, just to get DF belts. I'm sorry, but
that is not what I call a good time.

First of all, you need to understand the rules of the 3 different PvP
servers.

Tallon & Vallon Zek are PvP teams servers. Which means you can _only_
kill another player if he is on another team. Depending on the race you
choose at player creation determines what team you'll be on. And it goes
like
this... (btw, these "names" below aren't the official team names)

Lighties: Humans, Erudites, Barbarians
Elfies:     High Elves, Wood Elves, Half-Elves
shorties: Halflings, Gnomes, Dwarves
Darkies: Trolls, Ogres, Iksar, Dark Elves

Also, in order to pk (player kill) another they must first be on a different
team and _also_ be within 8 levels of you. Above or below. You also
cannot loot items only coin can be gained from killing a player.

Rallos Zek is a chaotic "free for all" IMHO. You can pk anyone as long
as you are within 4 levels of your opponent and you may loot 1 item
from them and coin.

I prefer team based playing, but that is my preference.

I play Vallon and I see twinks all the time. Maybe not as much.
I don't really remember playing on a carebear server.

> What is a "Care Bear server" (I've heard that phrase used often)?

A "carebear server" would be any of the non-pvp servers. The
worlds where nothing can harm you except NPCs and all races
live in perfect gleeful harmony. This server is meant for people
who get upset when they are killed by another player and feel as
though they should run their character in a world where nothing
bad happens. (lol, I'm just ranting there, hold the flames)

I don't think so. You have a choice to pk if you want. If you are the
"hunted" then I suggest you start running or start fighting.

This is why I love pvp servers. I love the fear I have when I run my
troll from Grobb to Neriak just thinking that I might get hunted down
by some humans.... or I could go eat some humans if I can find one!

No need for POD. Stick to the teams or choose Rallos Zek server.

Some people think that casteres are the way to go in PvP. I think
you can play any race/class as long as you _learn_ that role and
play it well.

I will _NEVER_ go back to non-pvp. I miss nothing about non-pvp.
Give it a try. Try a teams server. See the difference.

Hope I helped a little bit.
