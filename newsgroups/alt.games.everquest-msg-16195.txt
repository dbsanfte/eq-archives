Well ok, that 49 ranger is a lot higher level than the average mob and
other PCs fighting there, so of course he's going to be ok. At 40-42
(only times I hunted in DL), when a similar level ranger tried to tank
(especially against the ravishings), they needed to get healed a lot
more than a similar level warrior or SK (didn't ever have any pally's in
group for reference).
