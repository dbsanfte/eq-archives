Seems pretty stupid to me when useful upgrades rot because people don't
want to waste "loot karma" or DKP, but if you only ask for upgrades you
really want instead of everything that would be an upgrade I'd guess there's
a bigger chance you'll get it.

I'm a fan of bidding DKP systems myself, but as long as loots are distributed
in a moderately fair way and the guild is strengthened I don't care that much
about the perfect system.
