on addition - kick and slam are on the same timer.  Most warriors
perfer kick to slam, since it does more damage and, after level 55,
does stun. But kick is capped at 149 skill before lvl 50. So, assuming
you keep up your kick skill you max it by level 30. Then start
leveling your slam for the stun part, it's very useful to stop running
mobs in their tracks.
