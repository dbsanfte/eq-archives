My Rogue currently lvl 12.

Rogues are good in groups as they have a number of attacks that only
work from behind/the side.  Soloing, this means you can only use them
once (from stealth) to start the fight.  After that, it's toe-to-toe.

In groups, however, you can manouever around and, as long as someone
else has aggro, you can do lots of damage to unsuspecting enemies.

>(and deadly to boot!) is the class more like this in EQII? 

Rogues have Stealth, meaning you can sneak around without anyone
seeing you - your sneaking skill has to match your enemies level,
though.  You can't sneak past someone 10 levels higher than you.

> What about poisons as a skill? Do they still have them? Do they work better?

You buy them, and have them as part of your inventory.  When activated
it adds to your damage.  They last for quite a while - but if you die,
you lose the bonus and have to reapply.
