I've found that when trying to understand how Asians deal with software, 
it is best to think of them as aliens who are simply beyond 
comprehension. :-)

For example, we used to sell a lot of utility software in Japan.  One of 
our programs had an annoying bug whereby it would hang during install on 
some Japanese computers.  By "hang" I mean the mouse would stop working, 
the keyboard would stop responding (not even the CAPS LOCK and NUM LOCK 
lights would respond), and there was no disk activity.

We were not able to figure out why it was hanging, because it was very 
rare on our test systems.  Based on the frequency of hangs we observed, 
we estimated about 100 customers would run into the problem, and warned 
our Japanese distributor to expect some calls, and get system 
information, and maybe we'd be able to figure out what was going on.

Well, they got the expected 100 calls.  But not one of them reported a 
hang.  They all reported that the install was slow...it took about 14 
hours or something like that.

Apparently, it was not in fact hung.  It was just very very very slow on 
certain machines.  (And from that clue, we were able to track it down to 
a BIOS problem and code a work around).

Can you imagine any American being patient enough to wait 14 hours when 
an installer for a small utility appears to have locked the computer up 
tight?  After 15 minutes, the American would be calling up and saying 
rude things to tech support.
