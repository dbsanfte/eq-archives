Growing up I was dirt poor.  When I was twenty I tried to finance a 386/20
and got turned down.  It had about those exact specifications.

VGA was the best ever.  Those color graphics were awesome.  King's Quest,
baby.

I actually once said these words out loud:  "Who could ever fill a 40mb
drive?"

The new mp3 player I just bought last month has a 40*giga*byte drive.

Man, how times have changed.
