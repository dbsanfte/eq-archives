Finally got conversion kit thing in mai to go from cox@home(excite,
dead) to cox.net.. which was a big box
full of a few sheets of paper which I could have just got an email
about instead and switched over....

Anyway in then refreshing newsgroups I have these
besides
alt.games.everquest:

alt.games.everquest.binaries
alt.games.everquest.class-balance
alt.games.everquest.guilds
alt.games.everquest.misc
alt.games.everquest.quests
alt.games.everquest.spell-casters
alt.games.everquest.tips
alt.games.everquest.trade-skills

Spiffy... checked my old news feed (not cut off yet) 
and don't have any of those additional ones. So kinda liking cox
already though that whole excite belly up thing was worrying me.
