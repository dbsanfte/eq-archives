I read the original poster as saying he took a calculated risk. That he
might gain a great deal from the little he gave away. I don't think he would
have given the sword to a lvl 5, where there was little chance of any
return.

Not so much a good deed, as placing a bet.

I may be be wrong, but that is how I read the original post.
