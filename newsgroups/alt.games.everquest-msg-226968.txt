Aye.  And thats why it is desireable for a guild to go.   But for an
individual cleric / druid / wizard, theres little in it for him personally.
/random encourages selfish behavior.

Noted.  Replace cleric in the above example with druid or shaman or robed
class.

Which is really not an issue in a boss mob raid.   On most raids you will
end up with 2 to 4 items per raid.  Only on very few raids, such as a NToV
or Vex Thall clearings where you would take down several bosses at the same
time, would it even enter into consideration.

As you pointed out that a /random system can be tweaked, so should I point
out that a points system can as well.  The E'ci public's points system for
instance is pure bid with no minimum.  If you can't find someone willing to
bid a single point on an item, then it must truly suck.   It's only once it
gets up to 10, 50 or 100 points that people start getting bashful unless
it's a big upgrade.

> A bunch of minor upgrades adds up to a major upgrade...

(I know, a little out of context, but goes back to the overall idea.)

Which is what people at /random events tell themselves.   If I get this
minor upgrade and 5 more, I'll gain 50 hit points, a major upgrade!   And it
completely ignores the possibility that for the players next to them, each
of those items can be a 50 hit point upgrades by themselves.   A  net gain
for the guild of 200 hit points over a single person getting them all.
