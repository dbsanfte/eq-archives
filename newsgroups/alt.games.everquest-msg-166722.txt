}> Just out of curiosity, what do you think is the hardest class to play?
}> Hmm let's be specific, hardest class/race combo to play.
}    Human enchanter with a religion. Nice mix of the crappiest race, the
}hardest-to-play class, and a penalty that for this class is serious.

Bah, chanters are easy, and the religion issue is barely existent. I have 
one agnostic chanter and one that follows Brell, and it has barely impacted 
my game.  Would just mean another couple hundred iterations of a particular 
qeynos quest before I could start my epic.

Playing an enchanter just looks hard.  I pick bard as hardest for most 
people.  For me, for some reason, druid is the hardest.  Mostly the tedium 
factor.  And in today's EQ, race/faction stuff is barely relevant for 
difficulty. I didn't see it as all that relevant in the first place.

Wizard is pretty tough too, for the first 30ish levels.
