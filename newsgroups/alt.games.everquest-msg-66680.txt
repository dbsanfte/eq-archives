Since they intend to give the Luclin people a new interface, why don't
they, for now, turn on the Velious interface for Luclin?  Yes, even if
you don't have Velious, you have the code for the Velious
interface...you downloaded it in one of those patches that everyone
got when Velious came out, even if you didn't have Velious (this is
why, if you go to a friend's computer that doesn't have Velious, and
log in to your Velious-enabled account, you get the Velious
interface).
