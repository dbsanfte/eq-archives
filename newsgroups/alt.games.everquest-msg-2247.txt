I used to love Robotron, it was the one game that I could plop a quarter
into, and play until I was tired of it.  I was fortunate in that I was able
to get at a machine for free for extended time periods in order to get good

played was probably 6 or 7 years ago now, in some dark dusty corner of an
arcade.
