I have a 17th level Cleric who is a bit, shall we say, 'lacking' in
Wisdom.

To that end, I'd like to do some quests that might result in +wis
equipment of any sort.  I'm really not too proud at this point.

At lvl 17, what are some good suggestions for quests?  I've poked
around on some web sites, but haven't quite figured out where to start
or what's feasible for my age.

Thanks!
