Hortus on the missing honor belts, boots, and bracers (2)
coming of The Burning Crusade. This coming January will go down in
World of Warcraft history as the time the lore and the gods were
shaken down to their very foundation. Before that though, let us not
forget that one last big content update still remains for this mighty
MMO: the "Before the Storm" patch.

Blizzard's Drysc reminded everyone, via the game's official forum,
that the patch will be released next Tuesday, December 5. He
maintained that this is actually being done close to the release to
help players prepare for the expansion. Among other features, the
latest patch would include the new PvP Honor System.

"If the patch goes live as planned, this will be the last week that
new PvP ranks under the old Honor System can be earned, as the patch
will immediately introduce the new Honor System," announced Drysc.
Also, one final honor calculation and update will be conducted on the
said date to inform players about their rankings before the change
takes effect.

Furthermore, while there are no new PvP rewards that will be unlocked
for purchase during the last calculation, high-rank PvP armor and
weapons will still be included in the new Honor System. And to those
who are having second thoughts regarding the new system's efficiency,
Drysc has this words to erase your doubts: "It will actually be easier
to earn these items under the new Honor System than under the old
Honor System."
