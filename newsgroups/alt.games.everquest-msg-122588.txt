See, I'd probably reverse those figures.  "Shit", when generally used,
usually refers to "stuff" that the speaker doesn't like, thusly they
link it with excrement.

"Fuck" tends to get used where it has NO relation to sex at all
though.  If I say "You got to be fucking kidding me?", the word
"fucking" adds no meaning in and of itself, it just adds emphasis to
the sentence as a whole.
