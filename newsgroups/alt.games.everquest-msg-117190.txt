Thanks... the site from HP that gives the info on how to change the card is:
http://www.hp.com/cposupport/personal_computing/support_doc/bph06273.html

Obviously, following the instructions isn't working.   What you suggested,
Frog, isn't there, so it's worth a try :-)  So do you mean that I should
check the 'disable' box ~~instead~~ of deleting the individual display
adapters & replacing them with Standard VGA (as HP instructs to do)?  Or do
you mean I should delete them, switch over to Standard VGA, then check the
'disable' box in the Standard VGA properties?

As far as what C G suggested:  I've tried looking for the info on where the
specific jumper on my motherboard might be located that could be removed to
disable the on-board video, but HP doesn't provide that info in the
machine's manual, and I can't find it at their website.  HP firmly believes
in NOT providing their customers with that information.

I've tried emailing their tech support, but submitting the online form just
brings a message about how the form/link is out of date...and then points me
to an utterly useless FAQ page, with suggestions that I buy more HP
products.  Yeah, you betcha I'm ready to buy any more HP products....

The guys at my work's I.S. dept, as well as one of the engineers, think that
a jumper on the motherboard is the most likely culprit.
