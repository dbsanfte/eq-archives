A) please don't "top post" in this newsgroup.  Your reply belongs under 
the post it refers to, or better, each section of your reply belongs 
under the specific text you are replying to.  In this case, of course, 
you replied to only one item, so the two would have been the same... 
except that you replied to your own post, but were referring to other 
people's posts, which means you could have snipped the original content 
entirely.

B) Go into your socials, turn the page to get blanks, open a social 
button by right clicking on it.

Put a name in the upper left hand box, somethin you will recognize, say 
Dummy.

Now in the five lines below, you put your "macro"; which is to say the 
lines telling the game to do things.  These will execute in order from 
top to bottom every time you click on the button with the name Dummy.

/cast 1
/cast 2
/cast 3
/cast 4
/cast 5

will attempt, in order, to cast your first 5 spells from your memorized 
list.  Change the spell in position one, and your macro will cast that 
oen instead.

Fizzles won't stop the macro, it will attempt all 5 spells regardless.

BUT it won't pay any attention to how long the spells take to cast.  As 
written, it will start casting 1, then try to cast 2, 3, 4, and 5, but 
fail on each as you will still be casting 1.  If you fizzle 1 you still 
won't cast 2, because the fizzle takes part of a second, you will be 
fizzling while trying to cast 2, and will probably start 3 or 4 and 
still skip 5.  If you fizzle a lot but have a good connection, you might 
fizzle 1, skip 2, fizzle 3, skip 4, and cast 5.

So the next trick to know is pauses.  The pause command makes the macro 
wait a specified amount of time before moving on to the next 
instruction.  Pause duration is 1/10th of a second per number

/cast 1
/pause 2
/cast 2
/pause 2
/cast 3

Adjusting the length of the pause, you should be able to make this cast 
1 and if it fizzles cast 2 and if that fizzles cast 3, without skipping.

However, now you are down to only 3 spells.  There's another trick.  You 
  can include pauses on the same line as other commands.  This is the 
ONLY command you can do this with, but it helps.  The syntax is odd, you 
put the pause at the front but it executes After the other command.

/pause 2, /cast 1
/pause 2, /cast 2
/pause 2, /cast 3
/pause 2, /cast 4
/cast 5

This macro will attempt up to 5 spells, with a short pause between each 
attempt to allow fizzles to complete.

What if you really want to cast 5 spells in a row, and don't assume most 
will fizzle?  Change the pause time to allow the spells to cast.  This 
means reading the spell cast time, and then adding some extra time to 
account for lag.

/pause 104, /cast 1
/pause 30, /cast 2
/pause 44, /cast 3
/pause 22, /cast 4
/cast 5

That will cast a spell, wait for it to finish (even if it fizzles, 
though, we're going to wait as though it worked), cast the next, wait, 
so on.

If you are going to set up something to just repeatedly mash this 
hotbutton for you willy nilly, the last line should also pause for cast 
time of spell 5

/pause 44, cast 5

as this way the hotbutton won't be available again until the last spell 
has finished casting.

Now, hit accept, then push your button and watch the results, go in and 
edit the pause durations until you see all 5 spells casting with as 
little wasted time between them as possible.

Note that all the cast lines can point to a single spell if you like, it 
doesn't have to be 5 different ones.  But the most efficient thing to do 
is use 5 spells, each of a different specialization, so you can max out 
all 5 types.  This will take 5 times as long, but given that you are 
setting up to do it overnight without your attention, what do you care.
