It's been a while since I soloed a tank, sorry, and it
was a paladin... I seem to remember ~ 15 mins between
combats, which is about what I'm getting with my
soloing cleric. The paladin I levelled to level 16, so I'm
not really the voice of experince there.

...My point being that regen spells, or some close
equivalent, should be powered-up to the point where
they have useful duration and healing power.

That doesn't always work - when all you have is root,
multiple resists can result in some serious damage.
The point being there are always risks. I very much agree
that the current risk balance favours casters. They need
to rebalance melee so that a melee can come out of a
blue fight with, say, 50% of their HP intact. Most easily
done by boosting combat damage for melees.

See above. More that one way to skin a sabretooth.
Nerfing casters is one solution, but IMHO it's the
wrong one. If melees can't solo and casters can, the
correct fix isn't to make casters unsoloable, but to
make melees soloable.

That's another solution, but doesn't address the issue
of making individual combats more survivable for
melees in a solo context. I suspect that a combination
of increasing melee damage and sitting HP regen for
melees would come closest to a fix.

But I can think of ways that would mess up balance
as well. Need for magic-based healing would pretty
much disappear. You may or may not regard that as
a good thing.
