Pottery = easiest tradeskill to get up (perhaps the cheapest, too).  
Tailoring = fun, but really smegging annoying (lots and lots and LOTS of 
farming).
Baking = fun, and not too annoying, as you can buy the components *or* 
just pick them up as you go (I got a nice stack of DE parts just from 
our guild raid on Najena - and everybody else can just stop laughing, 
yes I DID say 'raid' and 'Najena' in the same sentence).  It's kind of 
fun having something else to eat besides rations and iron rations.
Brewing = also fun.  If only because you can get your alcohol tolerance 
up at the same time >:) (note: you might not want to do it at the EXACT 
same time, unless you enjoy failures and a VERY slow learning rate)
Fishing = pfft. not even a real tradeskill.  Still.  Marginally funner 
than Gems.
Fletching = actually useful.  Not sure whether clerics can use bows, but 
my rogue is in his 70s fletching-wise and has a very nice bow and a VERY 
easy pulling technique.
Jewelcraft = enchanters only, really.  Unless you're rich *and* 
masochistic.

(I like to use tradeskills to remind me how fun exp farming is.  And the 
other day, I used practicing pick lock skill to remind me how fun 
*anything else* is. :D)
