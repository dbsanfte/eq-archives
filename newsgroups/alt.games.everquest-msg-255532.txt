Hm. Doesn't sound like you had a group going but 6 individuals fighting
in the same spot. Therefore I understand your point.
But in a group I'd fight to win. So even in a scenario where there would
be as much mobs as you describe I'd try to finish this sucessfully. And
your 6 people had had enough of crowd control power there to lock this
mess down. But as I said this wasn't a group.
Heck, even if I die due to mistakes of group members I don't let them
down instantly. XP means nothing when you have a good group and a good
edventure running. Not necessarily in LDoN.
So overall I would not group with people who are afraid of losing exp.
But I would abandon these 5 other guys as soon as I realize they can't
work together and so mess up badly.
I hope I did get my point across. :)
