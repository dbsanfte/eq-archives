Hmmn - did the 286's have a built in maths coprocessor at all or did it have
to be added as a seperate chip? I remember my first PC (after leaving the
Commodores) was a 286 running at a whopping 8mhz if I remember right, and
had the obligatory 1mb ram.

I bybassed the 386dx/sx 's and then brought a top of the line 486DX2 66 with
a whopping 8mb Ram and a major cool for it's time VLB Diamond Stealth 64 2Mb
graphics card. First and last time I brought bleeding edge: set be back 5
grand.

Ouchies.

These days I tend not to buy a chip/item till it has been superceded by a
better one, much esier on the old wallet : )
