Just curious--what, if any, class- or race-specific spell or ability
do you find to be the most important for you that you really miss
if/when you play an alt of another class/race?  

For example, maybe you play a monk as your main, and you're playing an
alt that doesn't have Feign Death and gets jumped by some mobs and you
wish you did have it.   Or maybe you play a class that has SOW and you
miss having SOW when you play a non-SOW capable class (though there
are SOW potions or J-boots/T-boots so one could still have SOW
anyway).  Or you have a ranger as your main and you really missing
tracking when you play an alt that can't track. 

This can also apply to racial abilities such as hide, regen, etc.
