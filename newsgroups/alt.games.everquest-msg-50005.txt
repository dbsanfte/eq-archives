Well obviously since the stuff is no drop you would not be having it
on a character who doesn't have velious since you can't go and do the
quest. That does not have to be explained. 

And yes, you can SEE the velious items but you won't be seeing the new
velious graphics on you or anyone without velious installed. That is
one of the selling points. There is a lot of velious graphic armor
which is not the planes difficulty quest stuff (the thurg, skyshrine
and kael quest armors.. though the drops in kael (for the thurg armor
) are really easier than the other two or planes raids) such as
rygorr, giant vest, tizmak, crustacean plate, etc. 

So without velious enabled you'd see the normal steel plate armor
tinted crustacean plate color while with velious enabled (and load
armors blah = TRUE) you'd see the velious palte armor graphic tinted
the crustacean plate color. Without velious enabled (installed. ..
etc) you'd see regular leather graphic on a druid in tizmak and with
it installed you'd see the new velious leather graphic (once again if
you had the armor types set to TRUE)

As far as the updated UI someone mentioned.. I could of sworn I got
the transparent UI and such before I actually bought and installed
velious.
