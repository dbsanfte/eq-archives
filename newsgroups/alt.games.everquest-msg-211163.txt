I'm a shammy, level 65, got my run3, regen, canni 5, etc... What is
the next step in your opinion?  I've heard different thoughts on it. 
I was going to go with mass group buff, but don't use Khura's and
hardly attend large scaled raids.

Which brings me to Spirit Call.  Is it worth spending points in?  I
know, the pack of doggies look cool, but what sort of damage output do
they do in the minute they are active?  Anything noticeable on mini
bosses, etc?  What's the recast time?


Thanks.
