Look at this crappy ass PL guide I found


Powerleveling Walk-Through Guide


The general rule is that if you are a pure caster you will be able to solo effectively all the way to 50th level.  This is very true for magicians and necromancers.  If you are a melee class then you will need to group�Preferable with a healer type to get to 50th level.
Also, if you are a pure caster you should be able to take blues and blacks fairly consistently..as a melee class you should only attempt blues solo.  Remember the worst thing you can do is die because you will not only lose experience but you will lose the time to get back to your corpse (you could have been killing that whole time) and you'll take the chance of dying again while you get back to your corpse.
Another piece of advice is not to worry about your gear.  As you level better items will become available to you.  Most people spend serious amounts of time and money on better getting better gear.  Although this will help you level slightly faster the time you spend trying to get the gear you could be fighting things.

Ask high level players for there powerful buffs..it can't hurt but don't waste your time trying to get them. If a high level character is near you see if he will give you a buff or two�it might even be worth giving him some money for it

If you are a melee class a trick is to sit by the gates of some city and ask for buffs. A lot of high level people pass through this area. In other zones they are less likely to buff you because chances are you wont be near them and it's too much of a hassle for them to buff you and you usually can't go to them because they are in dangerous areas.

If you are a caster focus on getting the buffs Clarity and SOW.  Clarity will boost your mana regeneration (like 3 times the speed of regeneration) and SOW will allow you to Kite (cast spells on a creature, run to a safe distance, cast on the creature again and repeat the process until the creature is very low on hp or dead)
As a caster generally buffs aren't your concern so get directly to fight

The key is repetition. Kill, kill and kill again and never die.  Stock up on food/water and hit the killing spots I will talk about below.

Fast Leveling Guide arranged by level:

Levels 1-5

Well since you are a newbie you won't really be leaving the area closest to a city�All you need is here and getting to 5th level shouldn't be much problem.  Remember to fight everything to the death�never run because you will lose nothing (there's no experience loss at these levels).  Once you hit 5th you'll need to use my other tips.

Levels 5-12

Freeport area:

This is one of the best places to powerlevel in my experience. I have found that East Commonlands is the best place to do this.  There is a nice progression of creatures in this zone with guards and inns everywhere.  Evil races might have a bit of a problem trying to use the venders here because they don't like evil races.  Just make shout outs to get someone to buy you food and water and maybe sell off your items.  Remember to zone or run to guard if you get into trouble. Beware of the snakes here though.  Some are poisonous which is fairly deadly (it will suck about 1-2 bubbles out of you).

Try staying close to the east common/desert ro cave entrance located at -1050,860. That way you can try to make it to the zone if you get into trouble.  

There is also a lvl 9 female dark elf (6 minute spawn at -285,-450) in east freeport.  You'll take a big faction hit with the East/West Freeport guards but this is a good spot for exp. for evil races.



Butcher Block Area:

At level 5 this is another great place to get some fast leveling.  Kill large snakes and goblin's near the Crossroads.  There are 2 and sometimes 3 guards there so you will be protected.  Once you get to level 8 or 9 I recommend heading over to east commons near freeport. 


If you choose to stay in butcher block head over to chessboard located at 890, -2690 when you reach about 9th level. There are a few large skeletons that spawn here.  They are spaced enough apart that you can lure one at a time in battle.  They hit hard so if you are a caster use a pet, root, or snare them (run and blast).  Try your hand in this area because you can remain here for a few levels.

North Ro Area

At level 10-11 you can also go to North Ro to fight derv's.  Since these are derv camps they will train on you so either make sure there are enough people here to help or you are in a group.  There are derv camps at there locs:

1450,-375
220,360
-1125,1250
40,375

Steamfont Area:

Another choice is to go to Steamfont.  Head over to the mino cave at loc 1250,-1850 once you hit levels 8-12.  Stand in front of the mino cave and look out from the cave.  You should be able to see something that looks like a big sprocket sticking up from the ground.  Go over there being careful not to get to close to any monster.  Once close to the sproket look over to your left and you will see a hill.  Go to the top of this hill.  There will be a flat area where you can lure monsters up to and fight them.  Fighting here will get you to 12th level fairly quickly.

Greater Fay/Crushbone Area

Another great place to get from about 6-9th level is the orc camp near crushbone in greater fay.  Here are useful loc's when fighting here:

					Orc camp 1750,-150	(good for levels 6-8)
					Orc hill 1856,-100	(good for levels 8-9)
Orc lift 1000,225	(takes you up to kelethin and the path near it takes you to the orcs)

If you get into trouble there are guards at the orc lift that will protect you.  The orcs will train on you if you get too close to them, but there are numerous spots where you can fighting one at a time.  Only the orc shaman casts spells so they are pure melee fighters.  Another great thing about them is they drop weapons and cloth armor which sells for 1 silver to 1 plat each.




Levels 12-20

Oasis of Marr Area

Alright now that you are 12th level I recommend heading over to Oasis of Marr.  Stay along the beach area here and start killing caimans.  They will con blue black and yellow to you at 12th level.  There are some dangers around this area.  Sand Giants will roam around as well as some Spectres that high level people have lured.  Here are some important loc's for this zone:

					Inn				-1270,-300
					Zone to South Ro		-1850,0
					Zone to North Desert Ro	2500,0
					Orc Temple			1200,1125

Orcs can be another target to gain fast experience as well.  Becareful because they tend to train on people.

West Freeport Area

There is a bard named Trissa Whistlesong (6 minute spawn) at loc -110,-430 in west freeport.  She is 15th level but her hit points are only 280.
Casters can take her at 12th level and clerics, shaman, or druids should be able to take her at 14th level.  Feel free to kite her because the guards will now protect her or attack you.

East Karana Area

There is a Human Warrior named Milea Clothspi (6 minute spawn) at loc -1800,-6075. She is located near the entrance to High Pass.  This is another great person to camp and kill.

Levels 20-25


Lake Rathe Area

Two words Lake Rathe.  The aviarks here are great to keep beating on.  You probably have heard a lot about the aviak towers here. Use the maps included to find the aviark towers (aviarks are about 16-20th level). Also becareful of Webclaw (he's a slightly higher level goblin that roams this zone every once in a while.  The aviarks are in groups here so if you attack one of them then all will come.  Soothe is a great spell to take these camps.  You might consider grouping here or taking one or 2 while other people take the others. Here are some important locs:

					Aviark guards			2473,-2479
			2335,2472
					Zone to rathe mountains	2600,-2350
					Zone to south karana		3800,1200


Akanon Area

A favorite kill of mine is an NPC located in akanon in steamfont zone.  It is a single spawn (6 minute spawn) at loc 2335,2472.  This mechanic NPC (about 22nd level) has low hit points (370-450) and only max hits for 36 and has great loot.

Oasis of Marr Area

If you want to go back to or stay in Oasis of marr at 20th level you can begin to fight caimans, crocodiles, deepwater caimans and deepwater crocodiles until you reach 24th level.  The great thing here is that they don't train on you if you're fighting one of them.

Ocean of Tears Area

On the sister island in Ocean of Tears there is a level 24 female dwarf bandit named Elona Tunbrin (6 minute spawn)(740 hit points) at loc 1365,-10000.  Dwarf bandits have one of the best experience gains for their levels.



Levels 25-35


Akanon Area

There is a wood elf named Lyra Lyrestringer (6 minute spawn) at loc 1250,-750.  She is about 25th level and a great kill if you are not KOS in Akanon.

Ocean of Tears

There are 2 more dwarfs on the sister island in Ocean of Tears that you can target.  

				Hugan Tunbrin  		400,-10170
				Glendl Vargnus  		1250,-9220

They are both 25th level with about 810 hit points each and they can be pulled one at a time.  Once your level goes up a bit you'll be killing them faster than the spawn rate. The problem here is that you will take a faction hit in the butcherblock port so remember that when you take the boat back jump off the boat just before it ports and swim in.

South Karana Area

At this level you'll need to hit the Aviark Village in South Karana.  There are different levels of aviarks here so you can go quite a few levels here in no time at all.  You should group for this area though because it can be dangerous will train.  There are usually a lot of people here which is good and bad.  Finding a group wont be a problem but you'll have to split the kills with other groups.  The zone is probably too far away to get to if things get bad so becareful at this location.

				Aviark Village		-6700,1200


I am told that there is a hermit in this zone, which is also very good experience and good loot.  

Hermit			 -5500, -2780


The hermit is inside a house.  What you do is go to the wall on the outside of the house and say "I am here to kill you" He will then come out of the house and start attacking you.  The spawn rate is about 3-4 minutes so that's a lot of potential experience for you.  At level 27 the hermit becomes green.



South Karana Area

Here is another great person to fight for fast experience in South Karana.

					Tesch Mas		-3200, 800 


The levels are 25-27.  They are aggro and do train but this is a great place for experience.  Don't go inside Slitpaw because of the train dangers. Remember the goal is to never die..that wastes too much time (you can gain about 1 bubble of exp. with the time it takes you to get back to where you were)


South Karana Area

Another NPC to fight in South Karana is a bard.  He is 31st level (6 minute spawn)(1171 hit points).  It doesn't cast so a good way to attack him is by kiting.

					Vhalen Nostrolo		 -60, -230



Levels 35-40

Now this is where it gets hard.  You've reached the hell levels.  One reason they call it the hell levels is because there isn't much you can fight solo left.  For casters it is hard because it gets harder and hard to fight creatures without there next spells.  For melee classes because everything hit hard and casts spells at these levels.  Another hard part is finding creatures to fight that are in safe locations for an easy escape or they have so many underlings with them that you can take them all.  Well let me point out some locations that are good for hunting at these levels.

Steamfont Area

Gnome watchmans are the target.  There are 5 of them all level 35 with about 1675 hit points (6 minute spawns).  The locs are:

				Watchman Mylz		-100,-400
				Watchman Halv		-830,555
				Watchman Dreeb		-1385,555
				Watchman Prenn		-1850,550
				Watchman Prynn		-1835,565

Butcher Block Area

Dwarf bandits are the targets here.  There are plenty (4) on them in butcher block for you to level quickly. They are all level 35 with about 1675 hit points each.  The locs are:

				Den Ironblend			-1500,2850
				Dalbar Tarbrind		-1400,2880
				Lann Dalbrin			-1400,2895
				Tagnis Ginfarr			-1515,2975



Feerrott Area

There is a single spectre cave near the southeast corner of feerrott. There is a hidden cave down there and just about 10 steps ahead of the cave there is a single spectre under a tree that you can pull solo.  Casters should be able to kill it at 39th level solo.  Melee and hybrids may need to be 40-41st level. Clerics are the best here because of their cool undead spells.



Levels 40-50

Oggok Area

There are 2 gre guards at the front of the Ogre city entrance.  They have pretty tough resistances but at your level you can't be picky.  They are 37th level with 1675 hit points each.  The locs are:

					Bouncer Fug		1460,875
					Bouncer Prud		1466,930



East Freeport Area

There are 2 guards at the East gate entrance.  They are 37th level and I recommend kiting them.  The locs are:

					Guard Topplo		-350,-675
					Guard Sheg		-353,-700

You can also kill a guard next to the west freeport zone.

					Guard Zontrin		383,-310

North Freeport Area

There is a monk named Reyia Beslin just outside the monk guild in north freeport.  The monk is 39th level with about 2850 hit points.  You will receive a faction hit with the north freeport guards.  If you want to go back to that bank at some point you'll need to invis and click on the banker behind his back.

					Reyia Beslin		-185,-830
