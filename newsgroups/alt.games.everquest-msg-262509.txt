Laptops in general are always going to be slower than a regular pc, atleast
from my experience.  I have a dell 2650 with a geforce card in it, 512 megs
of ram and a 40 gig hd.  Games take forever to load, but seems to be ok when
playing.  Biggest thing in laptops is hard drive speed, i discovered my
laptop hd by dell is only 42k rpm or somethign like that.  That will effect
loading times.
