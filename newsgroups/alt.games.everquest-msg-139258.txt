I started playing a month after beta, and my shaman was my second character
created.  I wasn't quite sure about what the starting stats did, so I just
put some stuff in.  Now I have a post 50 shaman who is missing 10 wisdom
that he could have.  As I have two accounts, I've often thought of
restarting the shaman, this time with correct wisdom, or maybe a troll this
time (mine is a barbarian), so I can have the regeneration.  Regen is very
important for shaman :).
