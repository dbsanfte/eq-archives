You have picked two classes that depend on groups to do well.  That's ok,
you just need to realize that up front and don't get discouraged when you
can't go out and solo like most everyone else.  Both classes have their
strangths and weaknesses, but overall you'll find that a Cleric is in demand
throughout his career, whereas a Rogue isn't a necessary class until they
reach very high levels.

That said, a cleric is going to do a lot of sitting around waiting for
things to go bad and then jump up to save the day.  If things don't go bad,
well then you might just do a lot of sitting.  (this is an exaggeration, but
you get the picture)
