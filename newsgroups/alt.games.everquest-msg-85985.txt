Oh, it's not like I don't want to, he's pretty fun.  It's just that I have
these characters languishing (not exhaustive list, just the ones I can
remember):
20 monk
29 cleric
27 bard
32 mage
41 wiz
20 rogue
9 necro
52 druid
11 shaman

Hmm, I am forgetting 4 characters on the two accounts that I own "legally,"
I also have a 49 shaman that I've taken over for an ex-guildmember.

Meanwhile my 56 enc is working on his epic, his baroncy, level 57, and shawl
#5, and during the week I have 3 hours/day to play.

SO MUCH TO DO, SO LITTLE TIME!!
