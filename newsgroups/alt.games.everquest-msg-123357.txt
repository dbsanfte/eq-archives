In my experience in the Navy, we swore at least as much as sailors of 
lore.  I am one of the very few sailors I know who never asked his mother 
to 'Pass the fucking salt, please'.
I used to use my Navy experiences as inspiration when I really needed to 
let out an interesting and entertaining string of obscentities.  Then 
Southpark:  Bigger, Longer, and Uncut was released.  Dog-shit taco!  
Barbara Steisand!
