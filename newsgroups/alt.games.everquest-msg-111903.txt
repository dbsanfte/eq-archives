One thing that I noticed is that the idea of transferring from one server to
another is only done by the original owner as they will want you account
name and last 4 digits of the credit card used on that account. This is the
real stumbling block in your plan. VI will investigate any situations that
arise from an attempt to move a char with suspicious activity on the
account.
Now as far as your reasons for buying the power, I am in the same boat as
you. I am not some college student who plays every minute not in class or
something like that (not that there is a problem with that heck I wish this
was out when I was in college HEHE.)
Hope this helps.
