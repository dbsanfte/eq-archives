For the question to make sense for most classes, I think it is necessary to
interpret "one spell" to mean "one line of spells" for those spells that
have improved versions at later levels (or wimpier versions at lower levels,
depending on how you look at it).  So, for Clerics, DA and DB would count as
one.  For Wizards, Bonds of Force and Atol's Spectral Shackles would count
as one.  Etc.
