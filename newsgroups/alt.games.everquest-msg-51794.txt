Yeah, this is a great story btw, thanks for sharing =)  I had fun getting
the ToV also.  EQ is easy to play for me now because if I get frustrated I
watch movies with the wife in the evenings for a week or two or do quests
like this or just port folks or buff newbies in newb zones.

I just laugh everytime I hear the old song about EQ just being a level
grinder.  Blah, what a boring way to look at it.
