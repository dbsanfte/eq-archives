So you're solution is to roll over & play dead?  Turn the other cheek?  Give
them a harsh talking to?  Put them in Time Out?

What's your solution...you've got to have something besides "oh, let's not
tick anyone off," right?

The person who said "war never solved anything" was full of shit.  War IS
bad but it's sometimes necessary.

"Violence begets Violence."  This is what you seem to be saying (correct me
if I'm wrong).  Here's my response:
"Being a Pussy begets Violence, too."  Ask any school bully.
