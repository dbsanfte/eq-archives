Unfortunately I don't have the time right now to go to a law library to get you
the cases, when I get the time again I will find them. The major points were
argued around the UCC codes and when a contract takes place.  It was argued that
the contract takes place at the point of purchase, and if a EULA is not agreed
to at that point, the software people cannot just modify the contract after the
fact, by saying oh by the way you must do this now.

Most sights on the internet do not give all the court decisions, they give what
they feel is the important ones, the court generally hears about 200 cases a
year.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind.
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
--Thomas Jefferson
