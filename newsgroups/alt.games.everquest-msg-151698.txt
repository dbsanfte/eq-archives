I dont know, it was just a feeling I got when I read your post... believe me
I have helped in many many many many epic battles in the past..  I sure as
hell wouldnt respond nowadays though to:
soandso SHOUTS HELP ME WITH VSR PLEASE

If you really were desperate, 1-2 wizards could MB him, and on my server
they charge 1k or so per wizard

Wait until you find VS up (or know for fact he died that day).. if you find
him up you can be sure with 99% certainty that his death is imminent, then
plan a VSR raid 3 days later.. 3 days should be enough notice for a guild/on
a messageboard
