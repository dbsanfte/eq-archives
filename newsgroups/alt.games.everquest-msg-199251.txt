Allow me to reiterate what Kaev has said, and add in a little of my own
experiences. When I play my warrior I find that aggro practially cant be
taken away from me unless they REALLY try to when I wield a Frostbringer,
Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood combo. I have a gear setup that brings my
Dex to 149, at a reasonable str/ac/hp cost, and at that Dex those 2 weapons
proc 2-3 times EACH per mob, at least. When Im proccing like that its really
hard to loose the aggro. CH, Nuking, BS'ing, nothing seems to peel the mob
off of me, which is the whole point in the first place :)  Now, when I
REALLY need to hold aggro, and damage output isnt as importnat, I movethe
Forstbringer to the off hand, and equip a wave crasher primary. Using that
equipment Ive NEVER had aggro taken from me. Im just not as fond of it, as
my damage output isnt as high ;)
