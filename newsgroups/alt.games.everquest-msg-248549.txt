Like I said in the part you snipped, it's really heresay.  However, it seems
logical to me that SOE would attempt to railroad their current playerbase
into the newer product in an attempt to make it a commercial success, not
wait to see if it's a commercial success before the railroading began.
They've put a lot of money into EQ2.  After the somewhat limited successes
of PlanetSide and SWG, it may even be fair to say that EQ2 is make-or-break
for upper management.
