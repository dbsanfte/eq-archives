Or perhaps equipable items that give similar benefit. Water Wings for the
shoulders, or a Fluke of Nature in the back slot :-P Also useful would be a
Scuba Mask (tinkered item, perhaps) which would improve vision underwater and a
Snorkle (tinkered, lower trivial than Breathing Apparatus) that allows you to go
perhaps 50 z-axis units below the surface before you start holding your breath.
