You misunderstand the nature of copyright law.  Take the "fair use"
provisions, for example.  The fair use provisions do *NOT* give you
any right to use any part of a copyrighted work.  They merely make it
so that certain uses are not a violation of copyright.  That doesn't
mean that there is nothing else that might stop you.

For example, I could sign a nondisclosure agreement with a company,
and be given access to a secret document.  Does that mean I can go
ahead and publish small parts of that document under fair use?  Nope.
All fair use says is that if I do, they aren't going to be able to
nail me for copyright infringement.  They've still got me for
violating the NDA.
