I've done the black reavers many times for guildies...and I've been past the
see-thru ramp twice.  The first time I got as far as the first room at the
top of the ramp.  We succeeded in doing whatever it was that we were there
for, and ran to the zone levitated.

The second time, this past weekend, we passed through there over the bridges
to the 2nd room that looks identical to that first one (at the top of the
see-thru ramp).  Then we went past there over the broken bridges & cleared
what I would call a tower.

So please, don't use nicknames or assume I know what YOUR server calls
certain parts of that zone...please answer in a way I'd understand...by
using the terms I'm about to use.

Where does the Wraith of Jaxion spawn?

Ground floor behind the rogue-only door?
First identical room?
Second identical room?
Tower?

If the answer to any of these is "yes" then that sucks, but I'll get over
it. :)  It means I'm gonna have to organize a raid so that I can get to the
spawn point...then talk some friends into helping me with the boring camp of
this guy. :p
