LOL!

I noticed the same thing at my local Best Buy store. WoW was nowhere to 
be found save for a few strategy guides but there was a good number of 
EQ2 boxes still on the shelf. But when I was there I saw someone pass 
them by and go pick up a copy of EverQuest Platinum. So I said hello and 
told him to pick Stromm server or Morden Rasp when he starts off as they 
are the newest ones with the most diverse populations of characters. I 
also couldn't resist telling him what a fine choice I thought he'd made 
and why I thought so. :-)
