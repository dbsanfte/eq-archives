The reason that you need to taunt a mezzed mob is indeed to get aggro, 
the reason you should always taunt said mezzed mob 3 or so times is that 
taunt gives no indication as to whether or not it succeeded.  A 
successful taunt puts you at the top of the hate list, an unsuccessful 
taunt has no effect.  Hence, rather than mashing the taunt button like an 
idiot, you keep it available for when you lose aggro, so that you have a 
chance (no guarantee mind you) of putting yourself back at the top of the 
hate list.

Perhaps you should study up on the mechanics of taunt again.  It does 
not, repeat, does not add aggro every time you taunt.  It has a chance, 
each and every time you taunt, of placing you at the top of the hate 
list.

The reason I, and most others, prefer a knight is that although they have 
that taunt button, they don't really need it.  They have very high aggro 
spells that they use to add hate.  The spells are always guaranteed to 
add hate, even when resisted, unlike taunt.

The likelihood of a successful taunt has to do with your taunt skill 
level, and the amount of hate you have to make up for on the mob you are 
taunting.
