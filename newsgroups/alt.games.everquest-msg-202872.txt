That would work, if, in EQ, a 5 group party had the xp divided evenly to 
begin with, but, that is not how it has been working.  The way it worked 
prior to this change, to the best of my knowledge is:

Five person group consists of level 20, 20, 25, 25, 30.

After all bonuses and zem and such, let's say a mob gives 1000xp.

The level 20 members would get 25/(25+25+30+30+35) of the xp.
The level 25 members would get 30/(25+25+30+30+35) of the xp.
The level 30 member would get 35/(25+25+30+30+35) of the xp.

SoE used Level+5 in the calculations in order to make the effect of 
differing levels not be as significant as it would otherwise be.

Now, add a level 30 person to the group.  How does the equation get 
changed?  What about a level 27?

What happens when one of the level 20s drops, and another level 30 is 
added?
