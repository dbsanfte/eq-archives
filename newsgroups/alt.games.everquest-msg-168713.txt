    Yes, correct. But when you camp, IT SAVES YOU. So when you come back,
regardless of what has happened in the meantime, you come back right where
you camped, with whatever you had when you camped. Trust us. As of last
night (Bertox ring, second to last king, zone crashed, and trigger doesn't
pop until much after server-up) we've had four major zone crashes on us in
two weeks. We know what works here.

> I thought not, but some guildies strongly believe otherwise.

    Send them to Quellious, and we'll show them. I'm sure some zone will
crash to allow us to demonstrate. Last night the Bazaar came down a half
dozen times, once twice in a row (BANG, then as soon as it was back up
BANG). Quellious needs some serious work, or someone has figured out how to
crash a zone. And if it's the latter, that needs to be fixed NOW.

    If it is something player-caused, either by accident or otherwise, we
want it fixed ASAP. We've had so many blown fights because of this that
people are quitting in disgust. As one shaman said recently, "Logging to
play X-Box. At least if I lose at that it's because I suck and not the
freaking X-Box."

    No. /report Aluba will send a report of the ten lines in your chat
window when you do the /report, and will attach the name "Aluba" to the
report. The reason why I'd do a /report Delores is so when I petition, the
GM can find my /report quickly by looking for my name.

    Here's the last three nights for us.

    Sunday: from about 10 am until 6 pm PST, we sit at the dragon trial in
HoH waiting for it to pop. Seeing us there, another guild moves in and
petitions a GM to try and get a roll-off for the spawn. GM comes, an
agreement is reached where they have to flag up to 30 of our people if we so
demand, but we have to flag none of theirs until they've beaten the trial
twice (they have yet to beat it). They get first shot at the rotation,
despite our higher numbers. They lose, we beat another trial but the zone
crashes and the loot is lost.

    Monday: we do the dragon trial (it's up because of the zone crash), easy
victory, the planar projection spawns beneath the world. This trial would
have flagged enough of us that we could have started doing Mithaniel Marr.
The GM promises us the next spawn, and says he will personally attend to
make sure nothing stupid happens. We bag the other two trials, and some of
the people that lost loot on Sunday get it again.

    Tuesday: After a little over an hour of doing the Bertox event, clearing
the second to last king (you clear a ton of regular mobs, and 12 bosses
including four "kings", before Bertox pops), the zone crashes. This one
really stings, as it is typical to get a yellow or more of raid AA XP on
this event and several people un-ping. We have a key for Saryn, but can't
fight her yet because we haven't been able to get Bertox without a zone
crash or another guild on top of us lagging us out (the Bertox fight area is
right underneath the regular CoD area). So we go to get items from PoN for
two people who have quests to do - one mob doesn't drop the quest item, the
other depops on our way to get it.

    Wheeeee.

    James
