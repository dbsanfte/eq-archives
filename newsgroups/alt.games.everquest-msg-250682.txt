But Everquest 2 _isn't_ a direct descendant of Everquest, at least not
much more of one than Dark Age of Camelot, except in that it takes
place in the same world, 500 years later (so even that isn't all that
close).  It's not intended as a replacement for Everquest, because SOE
realises full well that Everquest 2 won't automatically gather up all
EQ players (unless, of course, they just transfer our
subscriptions...)

Just because it's called Everquest 2 doesn't really mean it has
anything to do with Everquest except for marketing purposes.
