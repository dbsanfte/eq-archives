I'm using a GeForce 4 Ti4200 and when I tried the latest drivers (a
few weeks ago, might not be the latest anymore), it caused my system
to go BSOD on bootup.  Luckily I had XP's system restore enabled, so I
could revert to the older versions in safe mode and keep going.

It looks like nVidia's unified driver architecture might be biting us
"older" card owners in the ass as they decide we're not important.
How dare we keep our video cards for more than a year and a half!

(I am a recovered "buy the latest $350 card every year" sufferer
myself.  Why must they tempt me so?)
