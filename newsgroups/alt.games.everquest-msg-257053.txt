Dear newsgroup,
about the level cap increase, here's the official info on the EQ website:

Level Cap Increase:
The level cap increase is being designed to allow players the ability to
reach levels above 65. With the level cap increase, new items, spells and
quests will be available.


Everyone seems to think that the new cap will be 70.
Sure, it's a good guess, but is this confirmed by any official source?


Also, about the upgraded Epics, everyone thinks that the original epic
weapon will be required to continue onto these new quests.
Again, that's a good educated guess, but has it been confirmed officially?

ttfn,
NZ
