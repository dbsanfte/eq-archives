I agree with you. EQ is a US based game , yet we do have Europe and
Asia as player bases in the game. So if I was to name a toon with the
name Rana Rene I guess that would be OK? Or what if someone calls them
selves the japanese version of "Hater of Blacks", Just how "easily
recognized" is easily recognized.

Well, like I said "Kahir" is very old school , but if you ever run
into a Hasan call him Kahir and he'll probably be impressed  that you
know, it kinda like a sign of respect. And the only reason I know is
because I use to teach at a predominantly Persian based school.
It's like calling someone named Charles , Chuck. It means the same
just very informal.
