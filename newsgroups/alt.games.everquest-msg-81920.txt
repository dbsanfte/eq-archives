What, in your opinion, led you to win against a dual wielding Statue?
Apply that to AoW

I bet you learn't more than you think

Irrelevent whether you took 10% or 70%.
The big question is: Why did you lose?
The simple answer is: Because you were all dead before he was.

The key to AoW is agro management. Once you have the agro funneled
through 1 MT, you then have to give him enough healing to survive. I
would imagine you either didn't have the MT locked down on agro, so he
went chomping though everyone else too fast for heals to land, or the MT
died and you didn't get anyone else locked on, so he went chomping
though everyone else too fast for heals to land. You obviously have
suficient damage output to take Tormax and Statue, so to win against AoW
is simply keeping him distracted long enough for the rest of the raid to
bring him down. Your MT is the key to holding agro, and your clerics are
the key to winning the fight by keeping him standing. Everyone with a
riposte/dodge disc, fire it as soon as your turned on to buy a few more
seconds of distraction. If 10 people die keeping him fully occupied with
discs, that's 60 seconds, 60 unmolested seconds of max damage output. If
AoW isn't hitting the right people, you will fail

Suck it up and try again. Every attempt you make, you WILL learn
something
