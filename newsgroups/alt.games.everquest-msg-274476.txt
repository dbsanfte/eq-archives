A couple of guildies were going off to do the ghoulbane thingy (I think it
starts as the dusty blue stone quest) and joined a group after an hour or
so.
I'm not sure how the actual zone in semantics work, but the group leader
basically jumped in, grabbed ghoulbane and kicked them before they had a
chance to do anything.  All they were left with was the wait for the timer
to reset which sucked.

They ended up getting onto the player's GL who was very interested to find
it out.  They were waiting for a good reason to kick the player and that
gave them the ammunition.

I like seeing people who take pride in the people they have in the guild and
that the reputation of the guild means something.  I don't know how some of
the larger guilds manage their players, it would be a horrendous task no
doubt.
