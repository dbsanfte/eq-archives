They can also "prove" rules if closer examination reveals
that the apparent exception:

   1) Isn't actually an exception, it's just a counterintuitive
      occurrence that still meets the rule, or
   2) Was actually affected by some other factor which
      made it not fall under the rule's conditions in
      the first place.

For example, if a planet were to suddenly go flying out
of its usual orbit, that exception would still count as
a confirming case of the law of gravity if:

   Type 1: A black hole we didn't see coming had flown
      through the solar system and gravitationally yanked
      the planet away from the sun.

   Type 2: Space aliens had used a tractor beam to steal
      the planet.

Both discoveries would demonstrate that our "rule" (the
law of gravity) still held, even though at first glance
a runaway planet seemed to be a blatant exception to it.
