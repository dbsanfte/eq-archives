I can vouch for the fact that LD characters run away.  When my barb warrior
was much younger and still hunting in blackburrow, I went LD in mid-train
once.  I was standing still near the zone to QH fighting off some gnolls
(trying to get at least a kill or two before I had to zone) when I went LD,
and when I got back on,  you guessed it, I was naked in Halas.  Well I went
back to BB to loot my corpse, but it was nowhere to be found.  So i did a
/shout asking if anyone had seen it, and sure enough, it was about halfway
down the tunnel, nowhere near the place where I had been.
