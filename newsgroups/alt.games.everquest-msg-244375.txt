His Silence AE has a fairly small range.  If  you fight him right in the
middle where he stands your healers should be able to just stand in the
corner of the room or along the wall and not get hit by the silence.  As for
the damage AEs, you aren't going to be able to avoid them.  Have your
healers MGB a heal or two (say Celestial Renewal and SotW) and just spam
fast heals on the MT.  Make sure everyone keeps buff spots open for the AEs
and the MGB heals.  This is a no holds bared fight, everyone gives it all
they've got and the MB dies in less than a minute.
