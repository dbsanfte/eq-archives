Just wait till lvl 44 when you get DMF, you'll have all sorts of
people wanting it cause its such a great spell.  It lets you float,
breath underwater, see invis, get an extra 70 poison resist, and even
gives infravision.  All that and doesn't require any casting
components and only 150 mana.  Oh and did I mention that it lasts for
an hour and 20 minutes? :)
