}You eliminate my freedom to read the newsgroup.  You eliminate my freedom to

If you -really- want to read that group, you could always petition Cox to 
carry it for you.  They're a private company, they may have some tendency 
to cater to the whims of their subscribers, after all.

And if they refuse, perhaps you won't want to be a cox subscriber any 
longer.
