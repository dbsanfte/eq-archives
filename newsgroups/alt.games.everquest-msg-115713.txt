Well, I don't so much post as lurk these days. Thinking of quitting
the game, as a matter of fact. I haven't played in a couple of weeks
now, and I don't know when I'll get the time to play again. No, you
can't have my stuff, rcsmiley. I have RL friends to give it to =p

I agree 100% with Cel! You suck, biz! Hooray for Cel!

But seriously, take a look at Aggewhatever's "Organization:" header.
Co-inkydink numero 4?

It's pretty obvious to me that Jesper Dalberg is a close friend of
Aggy, and that Aggy called him in for backup to support his claims,
whatever they were, I forget. They were stupid anyway.

Ooh, now I remember! He didn't get a buff from a couple druids!
Waaah, what a tragedy!
