There's a baker's ton of radomness of quality in this, or any I guess,
game.  I don't think I've ever based anything on any one topic or
experience.  Raiding for me was mostly over quite some time back.  Now
it's not really an option because of our guild; not exactly large.
But truly, I dont feel I'm missing much as there is content enough for
us even still.
