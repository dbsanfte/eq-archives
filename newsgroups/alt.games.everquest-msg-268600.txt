I would have to say a GF FX 5200 would be the lowest cost  to play EQ2 . I 
two box with one in my lower end PC, and a 6600GT in the better PC. Alot of 
times , the only difference I notice in the graphics is the grass / brush. 
If you get a 5200 may I suggest the 256mb version.
As far as your color degradation, that may be from the GF4Ti trying to use 
DX9  drivers
