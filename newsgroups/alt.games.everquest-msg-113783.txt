Group with a cleric.

The natural regen can be improved with items, and grouping with
characters that have spells. If you raise the regen rate you trivialize
getting regen items.

I disagree.

Nope that would be stupid thing. For one reason: High level casters going
into low level dungeons and casting AE spells. Boom instant level! If greens
gave exp I could get a wizard to level 60 in about 3 days played time.

But if I was a 20th level wizard/mage/etc and killed hundreds of rats with AE
spells that adds up quick.

Besides, if the exp is so trivial and small why do you want green exp?

Maybe. But think it through. There are several good reasons why greens
don't give any exp.
