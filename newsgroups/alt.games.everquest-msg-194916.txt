    For XP, LoY isn't much of a draw for a post-60 character. The dark blues
in Nadox are just at the edge, level 55ish, so they're too low for the XP
bonus (has to be within 4 levels of you). Even if the "dark blue" range was
expanded as was discussed recently, the light blues are still hefty for the
level. You'd be much better off in PoP.

    But for loot, LoY is fantastic, and that's an area where a lot of PoP is
seriously lacking. The average mob drops 8 pp, a saleable weapon, and might
have research items or gems (peridot, opal, emerald, fire opal seems to be
the custom gem table on Nadox trolls). Nameds seem to pop fairly often,
their loot is good for a couple hundred pp in The Bazaar to several K
depending on what you get. A guild ranger made 4000 pp in three hours
soloing stuff in Dulak, trying to get a charm. That's all cash and cash
drops, too, not item sales. Can't beat that kind of money!
