I have to admit I don't know what SCS is so I can't answer that.  My
game of choice is EQ and no other.  What other people choose to play
is there business and everyone has differing opinions as to what's
good and what's not, I believe I made it clear that it was my
*opinion* that SWG wouldn't be as good as people think.  And I never
said it was going to crash, you could put that goat scrotum you
mentioned in a bag and put Star Wars on the side in magic marker and
someone would buy it.  I'm sure they'll make money, I'm just also sure
that it won't be anywhere near as good as EQ *in my opinion*.

And if you believe everything you read, I've got a deal for you.....
