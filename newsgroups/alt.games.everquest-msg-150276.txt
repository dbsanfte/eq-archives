Unless its changed, it starts at 45. The proc is a 3 wave AE spell
that hits you as well as the mobs (fire resist needed). Its a fast
sword that does okay damage, the cold resist is good against cold AE
dragons. Remember that its a rain type AE. I've had agro from above
and below in a dungeon before (velks). Did I mention smacking that
wasp at the POD lift in Kelthin. Good thing I had SOW up. hehe.
