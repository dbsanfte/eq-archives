So there will be the triggered Zordak, and the non-triggered Zordak.
This means if someone else DOES KS me, I have a chance at getting
another Zordak. If someone KSes me, I can KS someone else. Making an
evil chain of events, I admit.

But- There is more of a chance than once a week for Zordak.
Theoretically, he could die DAILY. The merchant spawns daily- so the
turn in can happen daily. And the other killable version that spawns
every few days independently, INCREASES that number.

I don't think the Uberest of Guilds is going to sit and farm Zordak
indefinitely. One still has to do the rest of the quest to get the
clicky.

And...

Since there's a Triggered Zordak and Non-Triggered Zordak... Gee that
sounds like someone else's epic mob. Faydedar.

I'll bet triggered Zordak doesn't drop the full table like Non-Triggered
Zordak. That'll discourage farming.
