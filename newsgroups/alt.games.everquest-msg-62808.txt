Actually, he's a Lotus Notes developer. But being a content management
person myself (who hasn't had to write any serious code since it was in
Fortran 77) it sounded an intriguing enough question to pose here. As I
mentioned in the original post, I was sure it wouldn't work, but I just
wondered how it was stopped. I think the second programmer is now
wondering the same questions you have about the first. Thankfully, I
don't write either of their evaluations.
