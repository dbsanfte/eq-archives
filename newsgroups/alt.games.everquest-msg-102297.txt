It's now been about 6 months since I've played Evercrack, and I feel
good. I feel great! I actually get stuff done now! Here's my story of
recovery...

I first gave up Evercrack temporarily because I couldn't afford the
monthly payments (I know...pretty hard times if you can't afford 10
bucks a month, but hey, that's where I was at that time). I always
expected to come back as soon as I could afford it.

Much of the time that I would normally be playing was spent thinking
about what I would do when I returned. What zones I would hunt, what
quests I would finish, what items I would try for. I kept an eye on
all of my favorite EQ web sites like Casters Realm, Everlore, even
EQAtlas for the new maps of Luclin. I watched all the forums, figuring
if I can't play, I can at least read about someone else's exploits. I
didn't want to miss anything while I was away.

One day, I was busy with something, and I actually didn't get a chance
to look at all the websites and such. I made up for it the next day,
by spending twice the time on them. A week or two later, it happened
again, but I didn't feel like making up for that one. This continued
until I was going 2 and 3 days without looking at EQ stuff. I found my
time was spent with other things. I thought about Kaglek (my Troll SK)
less and less.

The first time I went a week without keeping track of EQ was a
revelation. I was getting stuff done! I was working and making money.
When I wasn't working, I was following other pursuits, like poetry and
drawing. Things that I used to enjoy, but had forgotten in my attempts
to reach level 60 on EQ. I was waking up from the Everquest dream, and
I was finding that real life was better...more fun in many ways.

Slowly EQ became less and less a part of my life, until one day I
realized I had no desire whatsoever to play. I thought of the hours of
fun I could be having, and I realized, it would no longer be fun for
me. There is so much to do in real life that to waste it looking at a
computer screen is unthinkable to me anymore. I'm writing more poetry,
drawing more (I've actually sold two of my drawings now), and my life
in general is better.

Looking back, I wish that I had realized sooner how my addiction was
affecting me. I may have gotten so much more done. But I'm free now,
and I'm glad that things were so hard for awhile.

*DISCLAIMER*
By this story, I don't not mean to preach. I am not urging anyone to
quit the game if they truly enjoy it. I'm sure many people benefit
from it in ways that I do not. I know that not everyone is addicted,
and even those who are may not necessarily be worse off because of it.
Honestly, I'm not even really sure why I'm posting this. Maybe I'm
trying to help others who, like me, are better off not playing. Maybe
it's just to give a final sense of closure to what was at one time a
major part of my life. Whatever the reason, I'm glad I wrote this, and
I hope you get something out of it, even if all you get is a good
laugh at a loser who got in over his head with a computer game.
