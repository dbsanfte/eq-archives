Short story is that you can donate plat and items to the Tribute Master in
return for the ability to turn on buffs, i.e. extra hp, extra mana, extra
mana regen.  It works like a bank account - you build up a balance by
"depositing" plat and items and using the buffs reduces that balance (each
buff has a cost that is deducted each full 10 minutes that it's active).
I'm guessing they wouldn't take your 2gp because either 1) you're too low
level (not sure if there's a minimum level), 2) the minimum donation is 1pp,
or 3) the TM wasn't the TM of your hometown (I'm not sure, but with the way
it seems to work I would believe you have to make donations at the TM in
your home city).  At level 15, you don't need to worry about tribute.  I
guess everyone has a different point at which tribute becomes a realistic
option, but remember that plenty of people have leveled up and continue to
play the game well without ever using it.
