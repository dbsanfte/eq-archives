Then dont get another expansion.  You dont need to.

One thign about on line RPGs that most people have to figure out, is
that the game is not about you.  ITs about everyoneat the same time.
No one is the main hero, no one is the center of it all..its a
collection of equals all doin gthe same thing and when everyone else
wants an upgrade that will take a full day or more to do, then thats
what everyone gets.  

Not to sound cold, but if you dont want to wait for stuff go play
wizardry 8.  its a great game....no wait times at all, and the servers
nevergo donw cause there are none!
