What counts is you enjoyed the journey and your accomplishments.

I've played since just after release and taken a few breaks here
and there.  I'm not sure I'm coming back from this one.  I haven't
logged in in over 8 weeks.  Whatever happens, EQ and the folks
I met in Norrath gave me a huge amount of enjoyment these last
5 years. 

I will, however, continue to scan AGE - keeping up on what's
happening (and looking out for Richard's stories) is a bit of
an addiction in and of itself.

At the moment I'm enjoying City of Heroes myself.

If you see a masked red-head with bright green eyes who's
engulfed in a curtain of flame, chances are it's me.
