URK!
16?

I know 2 is pretty common, but *16*?

I wish I had those numbers, but I bet
even they would have problems generating
a list of truly "active" accounts.

Your premise being, that if we discarded the
mule accounts, the percentage of SoV
enabled accounts would rise?  I'll go with
that.  To what extent I have no way of
telling.
