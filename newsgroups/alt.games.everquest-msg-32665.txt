 Some people in my guild have been killing the lvl 60   Ancient Wyvern in
Skyfire, they were able to kill it 4 times in the last 2 weeks.   Every time it
dropped only a few plat.   For a lvl 60 mob, that is really bad, lvl 35 HGs
drop more plat, and I have looted  lvl 58 spells off lvl 48 mobs in this zone
before.  
I was just wondering if a similar effect was occuring in other Kunark spell
drop zones.
