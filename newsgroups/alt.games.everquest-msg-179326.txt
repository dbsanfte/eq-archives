Here is my list of accomplishments so far:

Became one of the two Rev. 11 prophets giving me invulnerability for 3.5
years at which time I will be killed and then ressurected and made immortal.
Just took over France, not the best country, but not the worst either.

Am I crazy? Most definately. Am I the anti-christ? No. Am I Jesus? No. Who
am I? Apparently I am now the King of France which is now a limited
monarchy, but will eventually be a full monarchy with a feudal society
composed of castles and lots of empty green fields with flowers and trees
where little children and kittie-cats can freely chase butterflies in fields
of grain and lots of hidden pools and dark grottos for groping about and
exploring in.

Guess we will see what is in the headlines tommorow, something to the effect
of "France begrudingly offers limited military support for upcoming
conflict"
