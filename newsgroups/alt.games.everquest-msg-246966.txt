Yah, duh... everybody worth their salt knows that online thesauri have 
obviated the need (See... they work) for actually moving from a chair.

Scoring: *** out of *****

On the upside it had punctuation and was pleasantly formatted for online 
reading.

On the downside it wasn't really inflammatory enough and could apply to 
just about anybody and not just MMO players so it was too general and 
not specific enough. There should have been some mention of discarded 
costumes from the last GM event or something to really get under folks' 
skin.
The writing style reminded me of Robert Jordan who, in just 3 pages, can 
describe an open field. While there are many Jordan fans out there for 
this post to have been truly Jordanesque it should have lasted another 
couple of meg to actually get something done. Instead it was like a 
European film. The camera faded in on a segment of someone's life and 
then faded out again leaving the viewer wondering what the hell they had 
just sat through.
There was no real action, theme, conflict, or reason to finish the piece 
other than optimism that it would actually go somewhere. Sadly, the 
optimism was misplaced.

Good first effort though, and I look forward to more.
