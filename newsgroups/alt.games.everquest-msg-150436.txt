Talking to me?

Well im sure if VI really wanted to be assholes they could/would stop it..
its a definate flaw in the game that players take advantage of.   Exploit?
I guess it could be classed as that.

Btw I dont care in the slightest that you can bypass a locked door in CoM
with GFlux, that you can bypass The Hole door by swimming through a hole
(btw thats the only way ive ever been into The Hole.. all maybe 4 times)

The point is VI shouldnt just take it out on the big guys (e.g LoS because
they did it in VT) when its an almost accepted "flaw" in so many other
aspects of the game.

Me personally, my guild and I think debuffing rooted mobs is gimp, the guild
leader thinks so too, its something we just dont do.. yet I know 99% of high
end guilds DO debuff rooted mobs before engaging...   so theres no question
about whether we would "sploit" a mob on the pull.. it just doesnt happen
