That's where we disagree. After a few centuries of negative 
discrimination, I don't have a problem with certain minorities enjoying 
a few decades of positive discrimination, especially when it can be 
argued that the conditions of poverty many of them live in these days 
stem directly from that previous discrimination.

Then again, you aren't in the best position to determine that... You may 
have lived there, but you haven't lived there *as a black*.
