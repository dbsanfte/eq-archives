Try finding a spot with bone chips and spider silks. Necros and toons doing tayloring will pay
through the nose for these items, usually 50pp a stack for the silks. Another thing to try whan u
hit your late 20's and early 30's is harvesting plat in Rathe Mountians by taking out the hill
giants, if you can find a partner/group.
