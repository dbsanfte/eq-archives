It looks like the next scheduled patch is for the 26th, starting at
the usual 3am PST and an expected downtime of 10 hours. I'm sure that
it is no accident that this is the day before AO is scheduled to be
released. They surely want EQ to be in top form when AO is released.
However, I can see how this would backfire terribly (and really the
chances of it backfiring aren't too bad given the past record of
Verant). The day before AO is released, Verant patches EQ. Suddenly
they realize a potential exploit or other bug that has been introduced
with the patch. They have to have an emergency patch. Of course, the
patch isn't ready until the next day...the day of AOs release. So the
servers come down, and all those EQ players are left twiddling their
thumbs waiting to be able to play. Some of the players think "Why am I
sitting here? I could be trying out that new game!" So off they go to
their local game distributor and get the game. Verant just lost a
whole BUNCH of it's players. If AO really sucks, nothing bad really
happens except that some accounts are left alone for a day or two
before the players make their way back to EQ. No big deal because
they're still getting paid for that time. If AO really rocks, they
just lost a bunch of players that they might not have lost for awhile
still. I know that if I find AO to be a good enough game, I'm probably
going to get rid of my EQ account and delete it off my hard drive. Bye
bye customer. Bye bye money. I just hope AOs customer service is
better than EQs.
