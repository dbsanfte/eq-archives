They did not kidnap him.  By internatioanl law, and american law as well, he
was not the one who was supposed to have the child.  If I remember
correctly, did he not lose possesion of the child in the court.  If so, he
should of given up possesion on the child to the correct agency, then the
problem would of been solved.  By refusing to give up possesion of the
child, he was infact kidnapping the child himself.
