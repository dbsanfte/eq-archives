Yes the price is usually 1kpp, and if you don't pay they take your clothes
off and you gotta run naked in the arena and some even get fed to the lions
for entertainment. Females that get caught usually get transported to a
remote sex slave location in Odus somewhere and are never seen again! GMs
say that can't help out because they don't know where these missing people
go or who is responsible, but many people say it's the GMs themselves behind
these activities.
