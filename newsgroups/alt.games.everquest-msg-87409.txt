Ive noticed for a while, that when I change form I still look like an elf
(whatever). The spell icon is up there, and I still have the spell effects
(UV+speed for form of howler, faction in treeform). I figured that I was
still a wolf/tree, but just that the client wasnt showing me as such. Not
sure how I appeared to other pc's, but at least the npc's saw me correctly.
