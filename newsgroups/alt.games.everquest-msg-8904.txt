    Varies by class. For a cleric (and I suspect for all WIS casters), one
point of STA will give you (level/60)*3 HPs. So at level 60, 1 STA = 3 HPs.
At every level I've checked at that's held true. I've heard that for melees
it's four, and could extrapolate for INT casters it'd be two, but I don't
know those for certain. That also doesn't take into account getting STA over
the "magic numbers" (75 and 100).
