Has any one figured out a way to actually get some customer satisfaction
from the GM's on their server?

Case in point, we are on the Terris Thule Server and for the life of me
can't find one person that has actually had a /petition answered. Currently
my husband is having terrible problems with his Warrior Epic as the turnin
NPC ate the turn in items and did not return anything! He has send emails,
he has used the online chat and called the helpline all to no avail. His
/petitions are never answered and the online chat says"" Use ingame
petitions"\
well using /viewpetiton the next day he gets "You have no petitions in the
queue"

if he calls he gets you have to use ingame support.. LOL what a runaround!

any suggestions?

This is rampant on our server. the GM's just never reply! who else can he
contact?
