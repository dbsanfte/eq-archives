I have return kick and all the riposte/flash of steel shit maxed /sigh

Well they may be harder, but at the same time they die a lot more than
Coirniav does.  With the short timer, the first mobs in the script are
obviously gonna die more than the final mob (when beating the clock is as
big a factor as the mobs toughness). Not a good example agreed, the
cockblock used to be just killing the Guardian (his death used to kill the
spawn for 3 days... now they added some mild anti cockblock code to only
delay it for 4 or so hours)

I don't think FR is a good example.  To get to Fennin, you have to clear a
LOT of scripted mobs, trash and named alike, which is a serious time and
effort requirement.  Cynosure is the equivalent of killing 3 trash mobs 2
yards apart, and the script is "concluded" as your at the final stage
already.

Thats ok... after you see the drop rate of Dagger of Distraction in phase 3,
you will wish poker shit never dropped again before too long!

Well FR is a little different, because 12 people could trigger and then
spend 2 hours clearing it.  Cynosure is triggered inside 5 mins, so you have
5 mins for a force to log in and not 2 hours.

Also, killing the trigger to claim the spawn, and then moving onto PoFire
minis.. f that.  Have seen a gm ruling that said guild who spawned trigger
must proceed with their script there and then, if they killed another mini
elsewhere in the zone they'd lose their stake to the trigger.

If you killed Fennins trigger with 8 people, then zoned out and did whatever
while the rest of your guild logged in, I don't think any GM would take
action against me if i took my guild and killed it.

Yep. GM rulings are inconsistant, some GMs are fucking morons, some GMs just
don't have a clue how the script or event works.

We had one of those kinda gm's a long time back, when we were doing RZtW.  2
guilds were contesting RZtW.. we were first, the other guild petitioned to
make sure when we wiped, they got the spawn.  So we kill TZ, VZ, Fake RZ,
then AE TL (to get back to the zonein and buff for final RZtW).. pretty
common strat, I know most guilds bound right outside when they did the
event.   So we zone back in, all levi'd, about to drop into the pit.. and
clueless_GM shouts in the zone, "GuildX you have failed the event. I must
order you to immediatly zone out, or I will banish you"... so amidst many
"huhs?" he explains that clearly we had wiped when we left the zone (....)
and so its the other guilds turn.

Clueless fuck then /kills RZtW while we are engaged (he'd been told in tells
how the event worked.. what the AE tl etc was all about)...

So yeah, I wouldn't like to put my fate in the hands of GMs like that, when
rotations are suffice to ensure all gets a turn, with little to no drama.
