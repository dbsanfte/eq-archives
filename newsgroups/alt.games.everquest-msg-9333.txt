When we were out shopping for our current house, we actually had certain
requirements in mind that specifically related to brewing. One thing is
that our house has a full basement with a deepsink installed where wine
and beer bottles can be soaked without cluttering up the kitchen
upstairs, and there are also two tier, strong shelves where carboys can
sit and be racked from, etc.  I feel your pain, pal.
