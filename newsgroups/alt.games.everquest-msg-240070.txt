   So just about everyone who posts to usenet and community forums is a dumbass
but you?  

   I suppose that you haven't noticed that topics tend to drift a bit, even if
they do stay on topic.  And you expect people to go back through a thread to
reread stuff to figure out what the hell you're talking about?  Yes, that makes
you so much vastly more intelligent.

  Your brillance, in fact, is blinding to me.  *plonk*
