True, no shortage.  But I assumed your goal in the dissection was to 
uncover the underlying reason for that metabolism so you could bottle it 
and market it to women.  And it might be good to know about its tendency 
to fail right about when most start being extremely concerned about their 
fading youth...

It'd be much more effective, I think, if we could figure out how to bottle 
and sell a good self-image, strong self esteem, and a dash of confidence.
