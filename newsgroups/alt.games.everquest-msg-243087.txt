At least he plays them. Someone in my guild about every 2 weeks strips
their current "main" sells their gear, deletes the character and
starts from scratch. Quite often the same exact Race/Class over and
over. I cant recall how many Iksar monks this guy has started. I just
dont get it. Talk about SEVERE A.D.D.

I dunno about him, but Im sick to death of any content below level 50.
Its all the same tactics and challenge - but to each his/her own I
suppose.
