I finally ran across this NPC named General V`ghera in Kithicar.

 I was very shocked at what I saw. A total of 16 players doing battle
against this named NPC from two very well known guilds on Drinal. I also
seen this NPC kill 9 of them in a matter of 60 seconds. The survivors
quickly ran for the Zone as I did. While sitting there, I decided to con
these guys who seemed to get their butts handed to them despite the 16 to 1
odds.

5 were lvl 60
2 lvl 59s
1 lvl 58
3 lvl 57s
and the rest a mix from 52 up

 Now may I ask exactly what level General V`ghera is supposed to replicate ?
My guess would be about level 80+ but heck, at 28 I am definitely a newbie.

 On a side note, the two guilds regrouped, zoned and did kill him, but I
went through a bag of popcorn before he died. I did manage about 10
screenshots of the battle.

WOW
