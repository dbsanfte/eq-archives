I see it as God tolerating worship.  When people gather to worship
it usually involves teaching moral lessons, and reinforcing those
lessons with the claim that "this is what God wants us to do."  (I
am _not_ going to get into the common, not to say routine, abuse
of this by all sorts of "leaders" who are far from godly.)

But I agree that those who believe that God created us because
"He wants us to sing his praises and glorify his name" are missing
the point.  I'm sorry, but the God I believe in isn't some self
promoting adolescent who requires billions of fervent hallelujahs
to counter His low self esteem.  For that matter, I wish English
had a gender neutral pronoun without the baggage of "it", it seems
to me that the gender of God is both unknowable and unmeaningful
(what can "gender" mean for a unique being?).
