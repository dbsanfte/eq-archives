*shrug* that's certainly possible.  What else is certainly possible is
someone who doesn't have detailed instructions can actually ASK for some.
Nah, that won't happen...too many lemmings.

Last I knew you weren't in a guild, never were in one, and never intended to
be in one.  I can certainly understand your doubt that people will actually
teach others how to do stuff in game, but I think it happens more than you
think.
