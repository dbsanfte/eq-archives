sounds like the OP is has been playing SWG.  I played that on a free trial 
and just couldnt get used to the fact that the same item would have 
different stats depending on randomness.
Items in EQ have set stats no matter who makes them and what thier skill 
is.   A forged sword made by one person  is identical to forged sword made 
by someone else.  Don't have to worry about overstated stats or anything 
like that.  Also, don't have to worry about things wearing out, hated that 
about SWG too.
