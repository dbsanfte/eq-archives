Just to be nit-picky, KS'ing in CoH can also apply to attacking MOBs
that you can get exp from, but is currently engaged by someone else. 

I've seen some people argue in this NG, however, that KS'ing applies to
entire areas of a zone that a player happens to be in, which is
ridiculous. 

I think the polite convention is that any mob which is currently aggro'd
on another player is "theirs", unless the player is at a sliver of
health and running like a photon :)

And yet (annoyingly enough), many of the people in the forums seem to
think that their opinions represent the majority of the player base.
Checkout the thread on Auto-AFK logouts and you'd think a couple of
dozen people represented several thousands of people. Really annoying.

Very, very true. I'm pretty sure I've seen exactly 3 broadcasts about
KS'ing (of any definition) in my time in CoH.

Yup. Unless someone is actually griefing by KSing (i.e. following
someone around and constantly attacking their mobs), then the GM's
aren't going to do anything (Especially since mistaken KS'es *do* happen
- I've left my ice block on auto-activate a few times and accidentally
hit someone else's mob on the way by.)

LOL - Well put.
