WWII was all about assassination.  How do I know this?  Well.  There
wouldn't have been any WWII if it weren't for the recession in Germany that
allowed Hitler to come into power.  But there wouldn't have been any
recession if it weren't for the treaty of Versailles.  There wouldn't have
been a Treaty of Versailles if not for WWI.  And WWI was triggered by the
>>assassination<< of that Serbian dude.  So I submit that WWII was all about
assassination.  Right?  No?  Then how can you argue that WWII was all about
economics simply because a recession had a part in the events that led up to
it?  Do you honestly think that no matter what else had been different at
that time anywhere in the world, the recession *guaranteed* WWII no matter
what?
