Yeah and?   I fail to see why this is a problem.

Spectrals dropped more for me than for you because I KILLED A BADASS DRAGON
AND YOU DIDNT!

My guild made the effort to get into HoH.  Have you even LOOKED at the
dragon?

Newsflash..  1 year ago you could get an endgame weapon (primal) with 1
group.  It took effort, determination and hard work (killing a first brood,
then pharming warders) but it was still there, and I see killing AD as no
different to killing broods back then.

And this is wrong because?  Compare VP spells to top floor sebilis spells,
and think back 2 years when there was very limited entry into VP too.  Did
you bitch and whine then too about evil VI restricting access to your
spells?

Just like people such as yourself, never been to the zone, had no clue about
drop rates.  It didnt stop you whining and yelling "NERF NERF!" though, did
it.

Juggs/Trak/VP were not a special effort?   Killing A'D is no a special
effort?  (If not, go kill him yourself, then you could have got access to
the belts/spells too)

Sorry.. why is it?

When you consider most melee epics are a piece of shit already, I dont
really see why that was such a bad idea.

Well firstly James isnt HoH keyed.. but he is in a guild that does things..
he will be in new tier zones where you can again bitch and whine about
whatever hes getting.   I doubt you will ever be there, you seem more
content whining for nerfs than getting into these places yourself.

Put some hard work and effort in, enjoy the benefits.  Whats so wrong about
that?
