Is a buff more an important than a heal if there is only enough mana to cast
one and the person is about to die?

The person's HP was 1103 and AC was 695 with armor on, etc. The AC after
casting Guard was 19 points higher at 714.

Superior Healing casts for about 591 heal points.

So should I cast the heal or Guard to keep this level 34 paladin alive?

Thanks,

Vardiss on Firiona Vie
