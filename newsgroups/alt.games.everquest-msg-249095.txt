Major uses for a ranger in GOD: 
 1) Weaponshield tank while mad pookie DPS kills mob
 2) Harmony puller

The same 'improvement' has made the mobs too high level for
harmony and reduced average group DPS by so much being a 
weaponshield tank for the nameds is no longer viable.

He's right. The 'improvement' in increasing levels has
actually destroyed a set of tactics that made it possible
for the non uber.  The third time I did tipt to flag someone
we picked up 3 non uber guildy folks as our guildmates were
getting sick of it. Wouldn't do that now ;)
