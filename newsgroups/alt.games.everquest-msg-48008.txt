I've always wanted to do the same basic thing with clerics
PB AOE spells... but rooting mobs in close enough proximity
to all get hit with the AOE while staying out of arms reach
just isn't something I've mastered.

Way Verant works things, I wager the PB AOE will break
root anyway.  What a worthless spell line!
