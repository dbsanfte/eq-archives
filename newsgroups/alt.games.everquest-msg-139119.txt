What makes it weird?  Buy low, sell high.  It's the capitalist way.  Now,
what if 2 hours after he set them up, he gets a buyer for half of them?
Sells 5 for 875pp.  An hour later sells the rest.  Another 875pp.  He waited
and was rewarded for it.  If you sell something within half an hour of
setting up, do you think you may have been underpriced?  I'm not sayiong you
were, nor that you were wrong.  For you, it was excess stock, taking up
space, for the intrepid tradeskiller, it is a necessary component in
something they can sell for 2k.

On Seventh Hammer, there is a trader called Hipriced, and he is.  Yet I
still see the items that had been there disappear and others replace them.
I assume that someone is paying because a) they found what they wanted, b)
they didn't want to (or know how to) search the bazaar, and c) it was in
their price range.
