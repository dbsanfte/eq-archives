i don't really use '4', but i do sometimes use 'u', 'pls/plz', and 'thx'

writing a whole post using shortenings and slang is 1 thing, but replacing
the odd word to shorten it is hardly porn-spam (in my opinion)

I'll await your "porn spam" comment next time somebody uses HTH, IMHO, TIA
etc etc (things i see regularly on technical newsgroups)
