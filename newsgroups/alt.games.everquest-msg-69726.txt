Hi, There's a new online game I have been working on called "Orions
Outpost".
It's an online space war strategy game that is written almost entirely in
perl.
The game is almost finished and I could use some comments and suggestions.
Please check it out at the link below.
Also, since it is currently hosted on a free system, there are pop-ups, so
you might want to get a utility like WebWasher. (www.webwasher.com)
It will remove all ads.
