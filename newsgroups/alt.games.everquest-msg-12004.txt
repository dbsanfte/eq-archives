28 is when the bonus kicks in. It is substantial even at that level.

My shaman uses a damage 20 weapon, and I still commonly hit for 1-2 points
at L57. No melee class ever worries about that.

273 damage per minute on the knife, 296 on the GPK at level 14.

L60 rogue:
Knife = 1240 DPM
GPK = 1299 DPM.

That factors in the double backstab received at level 55, which in your
theory should severely slant the damage towards the higher damage weapon.

Here are the same weapons at L60 with backstab damage removed:
Knife = 595
GPK = 536

Hmm, lookitthat. Those 2 points of damage (which for a backstabber is a
major improvement) only improve backstab by 118 points over the half second
of delay from the faster weapon. If the two you are switching (I'm not
familiar with the bloodstained fang, and copelands didn't have it listed
for me to test) have a wider delay than that, then you are probably hurting
yourself severely with your slower weapon.

Well yes, if both weapons do the same DPM in raw melee either way, then go
with the better backstabber. But that is pretty rarely the case. Even
before the damage bonus begins to sink in, faster weapons are generally
better, even for no better reason than people too low for the damage bonus
are in DIRE need of their skill increases, and a faster weapons = more
checks = faster skill gain.
