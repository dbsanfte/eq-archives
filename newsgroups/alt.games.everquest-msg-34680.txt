I'm kinda in-between projects and wonder if I should install EQ and play in
the server room in secret...do you think its worth the risk?  I'd probably
get canned if I was found out.  Let me know!  If not, are there any text
based games that you play at work that are fun...ones that aren't quite as
obvious as EQ :)  Thanks!
