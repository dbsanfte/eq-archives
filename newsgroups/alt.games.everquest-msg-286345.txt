I used to hang out on the test server whenever there was a long patch,
but the last time I tried it took 20 hours of download (!) to get on
(with new log in screen and who knows what else) and then (ack!) 40+
hours of download to get the regular server working again. It was just
awful, we lost an entire weekend of playtime, and so I've avoided the
test server like the plague ever since. Does anyone know if these file
issues (if that's what they were) have been resolved?
I'm on dial-up (obviously) out in the toolies, and I'd love to be able
to goof around on test, but not at the expence of 60+ hours of
downloads both ways. Any answers/ideas greatly appreciated. Thank you.
