Not a flame, just a statement.  Your stinging reply really put me in my
place though.  Yeah,  I'll bow to you - you really are the master of
verbal repartee.

I notice that your adhearance to rules stop with your reply address.
It's illegal to spoof your reply address but yours is
lokari@_nospam_lokari.net .  Are you going to turn yourself in?
