I would say that personally it is a great investment for me.  I mean I spend
12.95/mo on a game that keeps me entertained.  Whereas I used to spend 30-50
on a new game a month which i would beat in about a week.  If you do buy it
I recommend buying everquest eveloutions.  It costs 29.99 but gets you
almost all of the expansions, the necessary ones anyway.  After about lvl 12
the game really gets enjoyable for me.  At these lvls the game actually
starts to define itself.  As far as a system, you don't really need much to
play, I think that it requires a P3.  I would say give the game atleast
15-20 hours of playtime to see if you really like it or not.  This should
get you used enough to it to really decide.
