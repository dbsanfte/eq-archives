There were new quests added.  While I was in the Neraik Cleric guild last
night looking for my new 34 rez spell, I ran into a new high priest quest
NPC.  It seems they have ut in some low level cleric armor quests.  Initiate
Armor, IIRC.  You get a box and a mold from her, fill the box with the
appropriate components for the piece you want, and combine to get some sort
of metal.  Take the metal and an enchanted mold that you get from her and
put it in a forge.  I don't realy know much more except for what I got from
the quest text.  It also seemed like the text was geared towards teaching
about quest text and key phrases, because at one point she said "For
example, if you wanted to make the breastplate, you would say to me "I want
make the initiate breastplate"" or something to that effect.

Don't know if there is this type of thing set up for other classes / races
or not, but would be interesting to find out.
