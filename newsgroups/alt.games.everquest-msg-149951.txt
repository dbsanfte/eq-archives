Well, I could go with my gut and say "So be it." or I could repeat, "I
don't let them die by any means." Once again so everyone understands
"I don't let them die by any means." For Pete's sake, people, do you
have to be so freaking literal and nitpicky? Would you not agree that
a magician should not draw aggro? Then I am right in saying that one
who "does" - meaning one who makes a practice of it - is playing their
class incorrectly, correct?

If you are drawing aggro so often that it's a problem, maybe it's not
your cleric that needs to change their ways. Again, for the record, "I
don't let them die by any means." My methods are often dictated by the
situation at hand. I just don't like it when they are dictated by the
players at hand.

Try not sitting in the doorway. Also, please enlighten me. Why is it
that magicians are hated so much more by mobs than other casters? I
honestly was not aware of that. One of my mains is a wizard, (talk
about taunt factor), and I have no trouble avoiding aggro most of the
time.

Again, duh. Btw, that implies consecutive instances of your drawing
aggro. Regardless, if you are sitting there a bit low and I see adds
coming your way, you *will* get healed. ***>>> I don't let them die by
any means. <<<***

I am always open to constructive criticism. I learn a great deal from
it. Just don't crawl up my ass on a high horse to deliver it.

Rumble <--- doesn't let them die by *any* means.
