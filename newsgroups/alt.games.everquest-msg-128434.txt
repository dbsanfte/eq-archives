I think that those statements reflect a lot of ignorance on the part of the
people who said them.  I'll agree that American foreign policy probaby had
something to do with it, though I'd be hard pressed to believe that Judaism
as a faith had much to do with it.  In fact, pinning the blame on any one
thing would be pretty difficult.  Then again, it's not hard to imagine why
he might say something like that -- lots of Americans are still looking for
a scapegoat.  Blaming someone makes everything a lot simpler.

I'm still trying to figure that out.  It makes me very sad.  It's a terrible
thing.

Human beings hurt.  Life involves a lot of suffering, anger,
dissatisfaction, etc.  Sometimes people simply lose the ability to cope and
they end up doing something awful.  It's sad that it happens, but that's the
human condition, really.  *shrug*  Just a theory.

Good luck to you.  Just don't lose compassion for the guy giving you hell.
