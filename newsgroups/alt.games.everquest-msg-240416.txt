Until now I thought your abrasive manner was just masking any knowledge
of the game you might have - we now see that you simply pull shit out
of your ass.

A quick FYI - Pacify (the last of the line that Paladins get) tops out
at level 55 mobs.  65 normal LDoN's don't have level 55 mobs in them.

I tried hard not to touch this one, but geez - my friends and I (65 BL, 
Mage, Wiz, Clr, Dru - all sub-elemental) don't even bother single pulling
in normal LDoNs - "Pull 'em all and let Inny sort 'em out" is our motto.

No defensive, no AT, no mezz, no shield - hell, no plate tank unless the
cleric counts as one - just pull 'em, sic pets, slow 'em and knock them
down.

In the future I'd suggest getting experience in some actually challenging
content before trying to tell Martin he's full of it.
