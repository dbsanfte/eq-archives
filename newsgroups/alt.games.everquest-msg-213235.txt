Hmm, bard cleric combo.  Well again you are speaking to experience with both
classes, again its not an ideal combination.  Clerics are great at healing.  Bards
are great at not getting hurt.

But lets see.  Clerics get Fear, after the bard hits 20 or so (forget exactly when)
and gets snare, you can fear kite.  Bards -can- fear kite solo, but it sort of
sucks, their fear song is PBAE, which means you can pick up unwanted (and normally
non KOS) adds easily, plus its short range and short duration and easily resisted,
which adds up to a mob thats only feared half the time... and even more fun, snare
twisted with fear can mean fear sticking with snare breaking due to resists and
short duration on -that-... all in all, after doing a -lot- of fear kiting in groups
and duo's with my cleric, my bard rarely fear kited despite technically having the
tools.  With cleric fear (despite common misconceptions, they fear anything, not
just undead, and have a fear line thats as good as enchanter or necro, better than
SK), though, bard can double up on snare if needed, and you'll have the mob running
90% of the time or more while always being snared, and won't pick up adds via the AE
effect (bard snare is single target)  Given Selos, a skilled pair could even fear
kite before getting snare, although its hard to keep in melee range of an unsnared
mob even if you are running much faster than it.

Bard at lower levels can melee just as well as a cleric, and at least you'd have
haste of sorts, slow of sorts, some DS, and a good healer.  By the time you get up
to "bards really suck at melee" levels, you'll have other killing methods to play
with.  Hmm, you might even get more milage by having the cleric MA while the bard
pretends to be a rogue, his melee output will be better than a cleric's after a
while anyway.

Lets see, clerics also kill by root nuke root... but with a bard supplying selos and
later snaring the mob, the root part would be unnecessary, normal nuke kiting would
be possible.  Bard can stack DD or later DOT on top of that, and lower resists with
the right DOT (the magic based one), and keep up the mana supply too.

Or there's root/rot.  Bards kill very handily via DOTs, but lacking root this can be
very tedious, running constantly in a circle chanting, gets dizzying and wearing.
Pick on undead, though, and the cleric can stack in her DOTs plus supply the root
part of "root/rot", should be a lot easier on the bard, plus pretty effective.
Again, making sure the bard is using the magic based chant will lower resists for
the cleric, making her half the job easier.

Then there's the bard charm killing to consider.  As with the mage, a cleric's
contribution to swarm kiting is questionable at best.  Nuking the swarm or healing
the bard can mean drawing aggro off the pet, who's hold on the mobs he isn't hitting
is tenuous at best.  Healing the pet, as someone suggested, is directly contrary to
this plan, which involves getting the pet almost dead, then breaking charm and
killing the former pet; this way you have 6+ mobs hitting one mob, killing it with
little time expended.  Cleric could be of use nuking the former pet, healing the
bard judiciously (you'll be surprised how often the bard gets hit... well not how
often, but for how much when he does get hit; thats 6+ mobs beating on him when he
slips and gets too close!) preferably via HOT.  But a swarming bard is going to be
doing 90% of the work.

Regular charm killing, where the idea is for the pet to kill mobs for you, a cleric
would be much handier.  Now the cleric can buff the pet, heal the pet, generally the
pet becomes the melee you wish you had (and that the bard really isn't by the time
he has charm), hitting harder and having more HP than any (untwinked) warrior his
level.  The cleric can also root the victim, which means when charm breaks you only
have to worry about the former pet, and can stun the former pet which keeps it under
control long enough for charm to re-establish it.  The first bard charm can keep a
single pet yours for hours on end, sadly its level limit is low enough that you'll
have to graduate to the kind that takes mana and is sloppier to hold onto, where
you'll appreciate the cleric's contributions more.  I'd say cleric/bard would be a
great combination for this sort of charm killing though, until the point where the
bard really can't charm high enough level pets to be of serious interest.. which
would perhaps be somewhere in the 60s with a CHealer for his pets.
