  Yep, it's still excruciatingly slow for me, though I did some
wandering today and found out that it's not as bad as I thought it
was.  Some zones are just terrible.  North Freeport is unplayable,
East Freeport is unplayable unless I'm out in the newbie yard.  The
East Commonlands and Nekulous, on the other hand, are quite smooth.
Neriak is sluggish.  Lavastorm started out okay, but after zoning back
and forth a couple times, it became unplayable as well.

  It seems like anywhere I experienced slight frame rate stutter
pre-December 4th, I now am getting frame rates of approximately 1-5
per second.  Some places where I was fine before, I am still fine.
Some places where I was fine before, I am no longer fine.

  So yeah, there is a lot of room for improvement.  If I could be
assured it would solve my performance issues, I might buy a $60
GeForce2, or buy my the graphics card I am planning on putting my new
computer prematurely (a GeForce3 Ti200 or a RADEON 8500) but from what
I'm reading on the Tech Support boards, it may not even do any good.
:\  I don't want to waste more time and money on upgrades when there's
no assurance it'll even fix my problems.
