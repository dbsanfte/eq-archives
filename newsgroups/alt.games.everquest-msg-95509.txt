No problem except when you just exit the LOIO. Sometimes one is there
but they are more often not. You also need to steer WAY clear of
Cabilis.

I run along the edge of the LOIO zone with a Iksar monk until I hit
the waterfall and I am okay. Any Drachnids there are usually at the
bottom.

Did you also know you can ride the boat in as a DE if you sit on the
rudder? Swim onto it when the boat is docked, and you will have no
worries. Just pick a good time to swim to ogre island or the firepot
room.
