I play on Veeshan, and as such have to deal with Fires of Heaven, and
their mimic guilds.  My wife tells me they're known as one of the worst
for twinky outfitting, power-levelling, and just being overall really
crass.  I figured ever server had their own Fires of Heaven and were
full of twinked out hack-n-slashers only interested in getting up as
high as possible, as quick as possible, and doing their best to keep
certain high-end camps cleared fairly regularly, making sure they were
the ones to do any new content first, etc.  They also have a reputation
for being remarkably crude. Did I mention they're crude?

Just to check things out, I logged onto our future home on Luclin.  It
was like going to England after spending years in L.A..  The people
were, AS A WHOLE, polite.  Need some gear? Just go into PoK and send an
OOC request. It was incredible. Even when they told someone off it was
polite. I felt so terrible for those poor, unsuspecting soles of the
horror that is imminently going to be unleashed upon them.

Granted, I've only been playing around on Luclin for a few days now, so
in the long run it may turn out they do, in fact, have their own
dominant uber-twinks who like to make life generally miserable for
everyone else, but so far I'm just not getting that feeling.

Also, their bazaar prices and items were remarkably different.  For
example, on Veeshan, the Festive Doll can go for anywhere from 250 plat
to 3K plat, and it will sell.  On Luclin, and again this could just be
due to terriffic timing on my part, I didn't see a single Festive Doll
for sale.

Xiphos - Veeshan does have a few good guilds, but many seem to be Fires
of Heaven, or want to be.
