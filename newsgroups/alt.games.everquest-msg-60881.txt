That is how war is, as the war-simulation-proponents have constantly
argued. One side is better than the other, one side wins, the other loses.

I have never met any rational human being (read: Not kewli0 PKs) who
enjoyed being beaten with no chance, or beating someone else who had no
chance. It happens, but it isn't any measure of fun.

"The shitty game" being my personal opinion. I'm not claiming it is the
worst game ever made (That accolade may forever lie in the hands of
Battlecruiser 3k), but HAVING PLAYED IT (not like dennis), I can say quite
frankly that I hated it. I've never stated that YOU will hate it, or any
other specific person...my only statement on that subject has been:
If you don't like PK, you will not like this game. I'll happily stand by
that.
