>>> So, even knowing that the mob may be engaged without you knowing, you
just rush in? <<<
If I was playing my warrior, I would run up to a mob, then either:

1) hit autoattack if no one was there
2) back off if someone was there.

My warrior doesn't run around with autoattack constantly on, as you seem to
suggest.


 >>>there's also the fact that the mobs are swinging weapons or clawing.
That tends to only happen when they're fighing. Add to that, that you can
see the MOB's life bar when you target it.  The usually don't pop with only
half life.<<<

Add to that, the *incredible* amount of lag that was in each zone. Yes, a
few times I saw a mob swinging at thin air. I left those alone. Other times,
I ran up on a mob who was just standing there, then suddenly fell over as I
got there. Never saw anything to indicate they were engaged. I stopped
wasting arrows trying to pull when the events started as soon as I realized
that you couldn't see the PCs. (fire an arrow, get a hit message, mob
doesn't agro, someone else on it) So I ran around, looking for a mob who
wasn't "fighting", then engaged.

Did I get KSed? Yes, a lot in EK actually. Did I complain? No. Whine? No.
Bitch? Piss? Moan? No, because I realized what was going on, the way they
"fixed" the zones so they wouldn't crash when 200 people crowded in, and
tried to enjoy myself.

I did get a helm finally, but never got the belt. Guess I'm stuck with my
SSB.
