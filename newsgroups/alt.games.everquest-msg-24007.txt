I am a lvl24 mage and just purchased a stein of moggok, and simply put i am 
little confused as to what to buy next. The important INT raising items i 
have now are 
2 - 2INT rose engagement rings
1 - Flowing Black Robe 3INT
1 - Stein of Moggok 10INT
1 - Black medellion 3INT
and a mask of some sort, think it gives 2INT

I am completly untwinked and have purchased all these items with almost no 
help at all, except a little from a friendly pally. I also have a Water 
Crystal Staff. And so I am wondering if any of you out there have any 
suggestions on what i should buy next. I can only afford items up to like 
500pp at most. Well any help would be great thanks.
