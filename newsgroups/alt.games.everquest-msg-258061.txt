No..no...that can't be true.  If these asshats are the best drivers around
I'mna cut up my license now.

I *know* it isn't true...I visited Oregon. And they...they...know how to
merge there.  The whole "look for an opening and accelerate to match the
speed of traffic" thing that they taught me when I was a wee lass...they
know it there!  Here in Cali they just keep driving straight to the end of
the merging lane, no signal, no looking over their shoulder, just keep on
trucking and assume they'll intimidate you into slamming on your breaks
for them.

But maybe you mean a different part of california...it is true that Marin
county combines the worst of big-city driving with an average demographic
of 70 years old.  Scary much?
