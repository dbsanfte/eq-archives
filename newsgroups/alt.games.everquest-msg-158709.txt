For the first 2+ years of Everquest Wizards were a VERY broken class
(no Translocation spells, no lures, no familiar, no harvest...). Only
real diehards played the class to the upper levels. For most EQ
players the only porting class they were likely to see was a druid. So
naturally most players don't think Wizard when they think about ports.
