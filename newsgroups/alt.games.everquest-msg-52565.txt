And that's pretty much the end of it. Pussy PnP vs. player ethics. The
camp was abandoned. If you want to camp some long, bleed from the ass
camp from hell for a highly desired item, you sit your ass there and
wait. Then, if somebody else shows up and tries to take the camp, you
have all the reason in the world to bitch. The rogue in this case
abandoned the camp and gave up all rights to it.
