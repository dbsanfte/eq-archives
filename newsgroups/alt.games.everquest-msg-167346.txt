Obviously most people disagree with you, as most people play on nonPvP
servers.

To each his own.  I enjoy the social aspects of the game as well as in game
achievements.  I would probably have fun on a PvP server as well, although,
SZ did not do much for me.

Playing on a nonPvP server is not just a matter of using a calculator, there
is a lot of randomness in the game that can make things get very interesting
at times.
