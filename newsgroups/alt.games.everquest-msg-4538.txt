Hmm, its possible that you are correct, I remember hearing
something like that.  Lets see, my current 2hb is 103 at
25th, my normal cap is 130, cap on the 2hb your way
would be 104, so I"m still under cap.

Here's my question, then, why is it I'm averaging about 25
points a round (max hit 39) and see many "real" tanks
in my groups averaging under 20 a round?

I'm using an ogre war maul, 17/50, which cost me a whopping
10pp and a stack of ale.  Surely any real tank out there
has put more effort into getting a worthwhile weapon loadout?
My strength is around 156 while fighting, but again, you'd think
tanks would be running better than that, I've got a pair of
orc fangs I picked up in a trade and run Yaulp 2 as a buff,
not fantastic effort there either

(by round I mean from one of my swings to the next, by the
way, using that as an arbitrary mark... any damage a character
does during that time span, whether from a single massive
blow or a quick series of rabbit punches)
