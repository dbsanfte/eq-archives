A polite SoW request includes an indicator that the petitioner
understands that my time and mana are important. I can't recall the
last time I received a polite request.

It's great that you're willing to do that, and I commend you for it.
But just because *you* are willing to doesn't mean that anyone else is
required to play the same way. 

That someone else chooses a different way does *not* make them rude.

If I'm walking down the street and a panhandler asks for money, it's
not rude of me to either ignore him or say "no". This is no different.

Not correct. My mana, my time, and my actions are my own, to do with
as I please. Refusing to put them at someone else's disposal is not
rude, any more than it's not rude to keep my change in my pocket
instead of dropping it in some beggars cup as I walk by.
