Missing the second half of the stun pull... stun and run, get to -behind-
the party, then mash the stun button again till target comes in cast
range.  It ambles up, then just stands there for six seconds in front
of the party while they lay on snare, taunt, target pets, whatever you
need.  Aye, the fact that you've got the AC and HP to stand up to
the mob if this strategy fails is a boon, time and again I've had to
slap down the people using their "druid under attack" emergency
thinking... I'm perfectly capable of sucking up some hits while
waiting for taunt if it comes to that, standing steely eyed staring
without attacking so as not to add aggro of my own.
