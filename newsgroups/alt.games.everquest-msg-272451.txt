Anyone playing a chanter in EQ2? In my seemingly never-ending quest to find 
that perfect match as far as EQ2 classes goes, I rolled up a chanter over 
the weekend and have been enjoying it thusfar. However, being only level 11 
now, I've pretty much solo'ed up to now.

I got to reading in the enchanter forum on the EQ2 boards and saw many 
references to the merits (or lack thereof) of mezzing for crowd control 
rather than just letting players unload with AoE nukes. I started having 
nightmares of my times in CoH and the frustration of having all my mind 
controller's controlling rendered unnecessary by just a blaster or two, as 
they dropped the mobs plenty fast enough without the benefit of my cc 
talents.

In EQL it certainly paid off to have a chanter mezzing adds. AoE spells had 
their place, but it wasn't in the typical xp group. Does this hold true as 
a rule in EQ2 as well?
