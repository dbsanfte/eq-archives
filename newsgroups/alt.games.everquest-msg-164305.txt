My monk never gets more than 70 Dps in melee. That is against soft targets
and fully buffed. While my equipment could use improvement , there is no way
it could ever go up that high :p I use a 15 18 left hand and a 14 17 right
hand . Haste on fist and vog easily brings me to haste cap.

Even assuming a 50% upgrade on dammage from aa`s and primal buff I would
have to see a monk logging above a 110 or so.

Best rogue log I have seen logged a 190 . Best ranger log I have seen logged
a 275.

Your account STILL dosent meet my perceptions :p
