I don't know about you but I had my 25 druid in WC commons last night
and had a blast, minus some lag, killing Werewolves and Lesser
Werewolves.  I actually dinged 26 there.  The players weren't
auctioning off the no drops either just announcing locs of anything
they couldn't pick up.  I picked up a nice replacement to my thick
leather apron, Girdle of the Holy Wanderer  +6 AC +5 Sta +5 Wis +5
vsMg 0.00 Wt , which I thought was pretty cool.

You may want to go to EQ2 or some other game if you are so convinced
that Sony is out to drive everyone away.
