Load up selos, charm, chant and BBB

Fire Selos.
Run around and agro around 4mobs (for the begining) without causing much 
agro. Runny pass ready to attack mobs is the best.

run around them in circles hit F8 to target a mob TAB TAB to get into 
tab buffer than sing charm. If charm resists sing again, on second 
resists throw in a selos. after charm hits. hit Selo again. F8 to target 
nearest NPC /pet attack and F1 F1 to target pet again.
Repeat till your pet is low, that chantkite to death.
If charm breaks before you can hit F1 F1, just ESC F1 TAB and use tabbuffer.
Have fun and let the XP flow.
