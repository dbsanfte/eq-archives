Our guild has quite a few rangers as well.   Somewhere on the order of 8 to 10
primary characters which are Rangers.   For comparison, we have about 4 people
whos primaries are warriors, and 4 to 5 clerics.  I think we might be down to
one person whos primary is a wizard.   We used to be shaman heavy as well, but
a few of those left for DAoC.
