If your modified stamina is 100 or greater, then losing stamina will
have no effect on your character's combat ability whatsoever.

If your modified stamina is less than 100, then you'll lose agility
and consequentially AC as your yellow bar drops.  Probably you'll
swing slower and miss more too, I can't remember.  I just always make
sure all my melee characters have over 100 stamina.
