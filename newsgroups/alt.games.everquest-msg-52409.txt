I think this part of your post is wrong. You lose a whole yellow in "after
hell" levels, and since these represent "normal" levels, this really *is* a
bulb of yellow.
XP loss is proportional to the xp for last level, so obviously you lose
twice as much.
Only losing 1/4 of a yellow in "hell" however is an illusion. It would be
1/2 a yellow normally, but only looks like 1/4 of a yellow because of the
scaling.
