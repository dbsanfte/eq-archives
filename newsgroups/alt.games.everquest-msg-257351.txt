He's an enchanter.  Why be direct when he can cast Illusion: you? :) Or 
cast collaboration on you and do the [post for me] quest, despite the fact 
it usually requires higher faction?

Aye, I agree, it'd be nifty.  I might be willing to pay 3... maybe even 4 
AA for it. :) But that's a far cry from 'the balancing act' being 
impossible without it.

Hey, not only that, but you'd have no excuse for not casting Curse of the 
Simple Mind on the mob too, just in case it actually does something. :)

Well, as luck would have it, this afternoon I got an LDoN.  With an SK 
puller who dotted every mob before it came to camp, so crowd control was 
out.  And a shaman, so slowing was out.  So I decided to amuse myself by 
nuking, until I found something to charm (which never showed, grr!).  And 
I thought about this post and tossed scryer's in there for the heck of it.  
when it was refreshed, I tried it on every mob, and it took 5-10 mobs 
before I actually found one that had mana... Of course, the instant I'd 
cast it, the next -three- would be casters, bastards!

Anyway, I did manage to get it to land about three times per 40ish minute 
adventure, so that's 1500 free mana... nothing to sneeze at, but 
ultimately only worked out to FT 3.75.  Still, with no slow needed, and no 
point in mezzing, I had to find something to do with the extra slot. :)

I do think that was a rather atypically low result, though, for an LDoN.
When I said 'Especially for an LDoN!' up there, I didn't mean to imply 
thre were no casters there, but rather that in an LDoN normal, it's hard 
for me to imagine running short of mana, unless the group sucks in the 
extreme, and then we're probably doomed anyway.

Let's start a petition.  It worked for druids!

Heh.  For that scenario, I'd want boggle ideally, so I could watch the 
mob resist it repeatedly. :) Actually, if we're going with the 30 spell 
slot scenario, I'd just cast reflect. :) But a good scream at the helpful 
dotter is always therapeutic if it's not memmed.  Well, therapeutic for 
me, anyway.

Ah, see, except in the aforementioned charming situation, or in aoe groups 
obviously, I never find myself wanting to PBAE.  What I -really- want to 
do sometimes is targetted AE, but I don't have that silly GoD spell yet.  
But that's just a stylistic choice.  Mine's built around almost 
exclusively single-target mezzing.  It works much better when the puller 
pulls less than 5, of course, but it can scale up.  Just let me charge 
first. :)

Aye, swap spots are godly.  Except for NDT and Uproar, (well, and 
scryer's/ToT/Argli, if you lean that way) there's almost nothing that 
can't just be thrown in a swap spot right quick.

Ahh!  That makes much more sense then. :) I rarely have uproar up in a 
group, except, say, when the healer's actually gone LD.  I did use it to 
be main healer for an LDoN due to that once, until 3 outta 6 members were 
LD and we gave up.  But we had 1/3 of the drops by then. :)

Ouch. Of course, these days, it could just be someone who soloed his way 
up, and has no idea how to heal -other- people.  Training wheels...
