Nope, that was tacked on later... by some idiots, IMO.  Like I said,
plonking someone doesn't make them leave your newsgroup, does it?  Unless
you're a big enough egotist to believe that you speak for whichever
newsgroup you happen to be plonking people in.  One of the tenets of
newsgroups is that you speak for yourself, not for anyone else.  I would get
totally offended if anyone actually told someone else, even a total troll,
to leave the newsgroup, and on my behalf also, it would seem.  You don't
want to read what that person say, you ignore them, you don't tell them to
leave.  Plonking didn't (and hopefully never) start off as a way to tell
someone to take a hike.  At least I certainly hope YOU don't mean to speak
for me when you decide to plonk someone in this group.

(source:  the jargon dictionary:)

plonk
plonk     excl.,vt.     [Usenet: possibly influenced by British slang
`plonk' for cheap booze, or `plonker' for someone behaving stupidly (latter
is lit. equivalent to Yiddish `schmuck')] The sound a newbie makes as he
falls to the bottom of a kill file. While it originated in the newsgroup
talk.bizarre, this term (usually written "*plonk*") is now (1994) widespread
on Usenet as a form of public ridicule.

once again, back to your troll baiting.
John

PS.  This is how you would reference an argument point -- by actually
finding a source that fits your argument.
