Actually, mage/shaman is one of THE best combos in the game, seriously :)

Ok shamna's lack the ability to fast kill, folk always go on about how
shaman can do mobs almost no one else can...which is true but they takes
AGES ot kill them.
Mages are the masters of the slam bam kill low blues like chopping logs
technique.
Shamns add crowd control to a mage (the class with the least CC).
Mages add superb DPs to a shaman (the class with the lowest DPs)
Mages have a port-a-tank and jsu tabout any item you need form armour,
weapons, foucs, pet toys.
Shmans can buff crap out of tanks (pets) and heal.

used to duo with shaman pals in every zone near enough, and trioed in
elementals.
So it is a superb combo!
