Matt, could you be a little more specific, please?
</sarcasm>

Damn!  I never would have guessed that many.  I was about to log the other
night, when a Vox Raid started.  I hung around the raid for quite a while
hoping to catch a screenshot of Vox, when I finally -had- to log.  They were
just making the Buff line at this time, so it probably wouldn't have been
much longer.  I really wish I could have stayed up =(

Are Vox and Nagafen the easiest of all the dragons?

Great list, Matt.  If you didn't look any of those up, I'm impressed.
