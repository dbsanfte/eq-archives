If you can name someone here who actually "can do nothing but bitch
and moan" about how Verant is "destroying all fun", then you might
have a point.  Hell, I'd even join you in telling them to
give it up.

But since I haven't seen anyone here who actually fits that
description, it appears that you're just being more of
a "bitch and moaner" than those you accuse.

The Verant open forums (back when they existed) were full of
folks like you, who apparently had nothing better to do
than jump on people who had some complaints, and muddle
up the place with spiteful, moronic comments like, "if you hate
the game so much, whiner, why don't you just LEAVE!".
They were so common they were even given a name, "VAKs",
or "Verant Ass Kissers", because their inability to
stand any criticism of the game whatsoever without being
offended by it seemed to be born of an unhealthy sycophantism.

This sort of sentiment wasn't any more charming back in
the 60's when the mouth-breathing rednecks were using it
as a dim-witted retort to protesters marching for civil
rights or a change in Vietnam war policy.  "America,
love it or leave it, you hippies!" was the only rebuttal
they could apparently think up.

>to whine,  WHY?

Because, son, it's possible to enjoy something overall, but
still be irritated by flaws in it that could easily be
fixed, or take issue with some of the positions taken by
the people who make it.  "This bothers me and I really
think it should be changed" is a far cry from your
characterization of "they're destroying all fun we have
playing".

Was that *really* so complex that your brain couldn't
grasp it?


>The answer is simple you do not like it move on, 

I predict that you will spend a lot of time in divorce
court...

"If you have a problem in your marriage, the answer is
simple: you do not like it move on", is the same sort of 
incredibly bone-headed attitude as the one you're espousing 
here.  Having a problem that you'd like to see fixed, or 
even several, doesn't mean that the overall experience isn't
good and worth maintaining, you idiot.
