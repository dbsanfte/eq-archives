What do you think that reality is based on?  The hard, cold numbers.

Groups that know what the hell they are actually doing *do* accept
monks as tanks.

See,  you're arguing against Sergey, a guy who actually knows what the
fuck he's talking about.  He's well aware of the way the game works.
If you'd shut up and listen to him for a bit, you'd learn some very
important things.

Fact of the matter is, before warriors can equip themselves in full
colbalt armor and above, Monks make the best tanks in the game. The
hit faster and harder than anyone else, they do more damage than
anoyone else, and they have more utility than a warrior.  It's not
until level 53 and above, when the warrior starts recieiving thier
insane hit point bonuses that they make more efficient tanks than
Monks, mainly thanks to Complete Heal.  Until then, Monks piss all
over Warriors in terms of tanking ability.
