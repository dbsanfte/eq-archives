Yeah, I thought about just killfiling her. I don't like the ignorant, but I am
more than willing to allow them to wallow in their own filth. But when someone
gets on the soapbox and shouts out stuff that is patently untrue, and claims
that her credentials mean her mistakes are valid, it gets me going.

I suppose I should just let her try to save some face by deleting the quotes
that show she was wrong and then maintain such was her position all along.

OK, how about this:


"I take it back Lokari, you never said your EQ password was not subject to easy
interception. And you never tried to use your credentials to back up said wrong
position"


I dunno, that just seems wrong to do...

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
