I believe that there are about 3 placeholders for the rare spawns which are
always
somewhere in the desert part of the zone. Usually they are just very similar
to
the usualy residents (sometimes with a slightly different name) but
ocasionally
they spawn as one of the rare spawns. The AC is the rarest alternative spawn
spawning maybe 1% of the time.

Have you had any of the rare spawns while you have been doing this? Things
like
giants and giant spiders? If so you are doing the right thing and have just
not been lucky
so far.

Alternativly the placeholders could have got stuck somewhere. Mayby they
wandered to
an obscure corner of the zone or into the jungle part so you should maybe
look for
anything like that?

Or possibly this theory is completely wrong but I've read it in a few places
and it seemed
to work when I did my jboots.
