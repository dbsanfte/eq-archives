I'm not sure that baking is going to save you money on food.... I really just
do it for fun, although the Stat Enhanced food is cool and I try to focus on
it.
As you enter Shar Vahl from Hollowshade Moor the first building on the right
has cooking supplies - also the cook in the castle.  I found lots of good info
at eqtraders.com under "baking trade supplies."  Incidentally, you can use
owlbear meat, spices and a jug of sauce to make bear steak.
I haven't bought any cookbooks so I have no idea what's in them...
 
>My question.  Does anyone know what any Luclin based recipes are, especially
>low level stuff?  Are there any Luclin cookbooks available near Shar Vahl?
