I tried a Troll SK (right before leaving EQ) and found it really
boring.  That's probably because I never reached level 9 (spells).

: she chose) and she pretty much kicked-ass even at low levels.

I *loved* playing my High Elf Mage to level 20.  Something about
having pets and being able to conjure stuff was really fun.

I thought my Wood Elf Druid was powerful until I decided to try
playing a Human Necromancer.  All I can say is: Wow.

The only thing the Necromancer class is missing is a button
titled "Give me XP" on their UI.  :)  (I didn't play past 20
though.)
