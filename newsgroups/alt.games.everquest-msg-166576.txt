Not worth the time to me. And I'm in a heavy raiding guild. But thats
just because almost all our other clerics have their epic that I can
do that. All I have to do is rez an epiced cleric. It would be
somewhat nice to have for rezzing in an xp group but still not worth
the time it takes to get it. I hate long boring camps. And a side
benefit, its easy to turn down rez requests, sorry dude, no mana for
rez.
