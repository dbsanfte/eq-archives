Rosewhite Blossom's guide to good Rivervale faction:

Kill enough goblins in Runnyeye and you can become non KOS to the guards
(Guardians of the Vale) and the Druids (Storm Reapers.) Collect every
blasted set of non-shattered Runnyeye War beads. When you get to
apprehensive (should work), turn in a huge number of Deathfish Slash Belts
to Deputy Budo (facing the gate in the Wall on the Rivervale side, Budo is
in the first tower to your left.) That will raise faction with the
Guardians of the Vale, the Storm Reapers, Merchants of Rivervale and Mayor
Ghubbin (ie other citizens of Rivervale.) WARNING: turning in belts lowers
your faction with the Dread Outer Guard (DE guards in Nektulos.) You can
also raise Guardian faction by killing bixies (regular and drones), chasm
and gorge minotaurs, evil eyes and muddites (in the Gorge of King Xorbb on
the other side of Runnyeye) and deathfist orcs (pawns and centurions in
the Commonlands and Misty.) Killing muddites will also raise faction with
the Merchants of Rivervale.

You can also hand bandages to Whatshisname Honeybugger to raise faction
with the Deeppockets (Rivervale Rogues guild), Guardians, Mayor and
Merchants. It will, though, lower your faction with the Coalition of Trade
Folk Illegal, the Freeport rogues guild.

When you are indifferent to the guards, go in to Rivervale and turn in
those Runnyeye beads to the Sherrif (top floor of the citadel, same
building as the warrior's guild and the bank) WARNING: turning in beads
will lower your faction with the Dread Outer Guard.

You may now shop and bank in Rivervale in relative safety, provided you
enter and leave through Misty. YOU CAN NOT GO IN AND OUT THROUGH KITHICOR!
Don't even try. That road run right past the Church of Mischief (Rivervale
clerics) and there is one and only one (known) quest that raises faction
with the Priests of Mischief: it requires repeatedly turning in two ruined
wolf pelts, a black wolf pelt and a foraged berries to Beek Guinders...
who is inside the Church. There are several high level clerics standing
outside the church, keeping a watchful eye out for evil passers-by.
