First, if you can't find any comparisons online between the Radeon
9700 Pro and the GeForce 4 Ti 4600, you should probably try a bit
harder. I have come across several without even searching.

That said, according to everything I have read, the Radeon 9700 Pro
pretty well smokes anything from Nvidia right now. That will change
soon, but not until well after Christmas, and even then ATI is sitting
on its next "GeForce killer" even as we speak, waiting for that next
salvo from Nvidia.
