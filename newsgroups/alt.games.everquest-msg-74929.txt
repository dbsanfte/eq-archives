My current System:

P3-800 Coppermine
512 Megs of Ram
Geforce DDR 256 (1st Generation Card)
SBLive

I'm sort of at a crossroads on what to upgrade.
EQ used to run perfectly fine until the SOL Upgrade/Release.  Now it
stutters quite a bit during combat (need to disable spell effects to
play).

So, this is what I am wondering:
My first thought was to buy a Geforce TI500 (but the price is sort of
steep).

Just for kicks, I ran Performance Monitor under WinXP pro to see how
much memory was being used in EQ.  I was quite surpised that it pretty
much ate up most of the available memory (left about 10megs at the
minimum reading).

Ram is cheap (I can get a 512SDram stick for $50)....so I became
confident that due to the high memory usage- it would do wonders to
the game...bummer that I found out that my MB currently only supports
up to 512.  So upgrading the Ram to 1GB is out of the question.

So now I am wondering, should I just upgrade my Video Card?  Will I
notice a significant difference in gameplay? 

All I want to do is what I was able to do before- run fullscreen
@1024X768.  Now, in order to play- I usually just revert to the
default screen with the tiny window.

Do you think the TI500 will help significantly? Or should I just wait
to get another PC...i.e 2Ghz CPU, 1GB of Ram, Geforce TI500 etc...

Any comments appreciated!!!
