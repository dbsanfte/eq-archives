Ya. it's fun and enjoyable when those retards don't want to get off
their lazy ass fix bug THEY make by screwing up (nerfing) every damn
thing in the bloody game. Or fix new servers and omfg they got a new
server. But you have to PAY them to go to it. even after they lie
about thing like when a server reachs  (was it ?) 2000 people they
will split it off. So what do they do. They take the numbers off of
the server list so you can't see they are outright blowing smoke up
somewhere and replace it with an "UP" or "DOWN". I was so pleased to
see Verant got the boot or whatever it was. (Just happy they were
gone.) Now these assholes at Sony are screwing up just as bad. if not
worse. You people got these so called "Test Servers" Start using em
and stop dumping these BS patchs on use and leaving US be your damn
beta testers.
