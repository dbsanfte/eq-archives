They put the rare parts of the rare spells in LDON raid encounter zones
which is why you didn't see many rare spell components. I saw 2 page
118's drop in one LDoN raid, the rare page for Topor. If you didn't do
LDoN raids, and really, no one who was capable of doing them liked them
enough to bother, your chances of seeing the rare spells was better
spent doing the vp key quest and farming drakes for their drops.
