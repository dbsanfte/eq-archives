    I think hell might be freezing over.  I've finally gotten a
character over 40... just dinged 43 last night in fact.  I can get to 44
in the zone we're in (Guntak).  Just quested the Temperance spell, so
have that waiting to scribe.  I know, 43 is hardly what most people
would consider to be a high level.  But I'm now to the point where I can
fight in zones where that I never thought I would reach.  I can (soon)
sit my ass in the PoK trying to sell temp for hours on end, if I'm of a
mind to (can't really see that happening, though).  I've even got quite
a bit of plat (for me) saved towards the Buy Annie a Riding Lizard
fund.  Heck... it seams likely that I might be able to click on the
Plane of Tranquility stone one day and actually go somewhere instead of
being told that I'm too much of a pussy to pass.

   There are several things Lenny and I want to try when we do hit 44,
and get bit of insurance exp.  We want to slap around some spiders in FV
(revenge).  We want to try the big underbulks in Echo caverns that keep
beating us down every time we've tried them in the past.  We see how far
we can duo in the ToFS.  We want to see if we really can survive a
hunting trip into the Dreadlands.  This is fun time for us.

  We've recently deguilded.  Our guild started out as a strict
Role-playing guild, as of late all the guild chatter during prime hours
was of the "Gimme some help u guyz plz" variety.  This wouldn't be so
bad, but our guild rarely raided or hunted together.  All our friends
from old left long ago.  It was more like the guild left us, really. 
So, right now we are free spirits, though we are being courted fairly
heavily by one guild that is warrior shy, and that wouldn't hate having
another cleric either.  But we aren't rushing into anything.

   I asked this question in serverwide.age:age last night... What level
will we likely be able to duo to?  There were a couple who said that we
should be able to make it 60, though we would have to stay out of PoP
zones.   Someone else said that the low fifties was probably more
likely. 
So.. what do you all think?  Assuming we don't guild soon, how far can
our duoing ways take us?
