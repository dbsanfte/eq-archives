Different teams.  Generally, major gaming companies have several
development groups that work independently.  In the FAQ for Midgard, one
of the questions is will it take away from their effort to improve AO.
Their answer was something to the effect that their best and most
competent team is working on AO, and will continue to do so.  So, AO
players have nothing to worry about.  Potential Midgard players might
think twice, though, since Funcom has basically said that it is the
second string team doing that game.  They should reword that FAQ answer
if they want to inspire confidence in Midgard. :-)
