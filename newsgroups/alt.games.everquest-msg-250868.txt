Yeah, Amiga.  I've heard a lot of good things about that Amiga, too. 
But I just couldn't bring myself to make the move, when I'd been 
betrayed like that, I switched operating systems entirely instead.

I also considered Macintosh, which honestly was a better system than 
IBM.. but IBM had more shelf space even then, and had IBM clones while 
Apple kept their system to themselves.  Looking back I made the right 
choice, just like most people who picked the inferior VHS over Betamax 
made the right choice; unless you have pretty specific needs, its better 
to take the system that has more people making things for it.

I keep looking at Linux... but staying with Windows, again for the same 
C64 era reasons; I remember when there just stopped being new software 
produced for the Commodore, very painful to see a huge selection for DOS 
and nothing for the machine I owned.  Linux isn't going to die... but it 
doesn't seem like its going to take off and become the mainstream either.

No, its not.  Its remarkable, as you say, how backwards compatible it 
is.  But more important than being able to run old games, for me, was 
that there was always an upgrade path for my spreadsheet software that 
let me keep my old data around.

The games are a big part of the plan, of course, but I only need that to 
work over a relatively short term, games designed for DOS worked on 
Windows 3.1, 3.1 games worked on 95, 95 games worked on 98 and so on.

I do still play Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe every now and then... 
but I had to transfer it onto a 3.5 floppy.  Looks like if I upgrade 
machines again I'll have to transfer to CDRom because most of the new 
machines don't even have a 3.5 drive!

Getting a bit off topic though, the idea was to use Operating systems as 
a metaphor we could apply to MMOGs...
