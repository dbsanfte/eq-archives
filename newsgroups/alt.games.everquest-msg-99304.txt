Exactly Biz....In a perfect world, we could shout "Doing Kromriff Military
Leggings, please leave giants alone for a few"  (or in the old days, in FM,
"I am camping the cycle") and have a good response. And a while back, we
could , reasonably expect a good response. But now, like you said, a shout
of intent on something like that brings the KSing vultures to bear on
whatever you are spawning / camping / waiting for. Could this be the result
of so called "uber-n00ber" guilds? (For those that dont know, uber-n00bers
are people who have basically been PLed thru their entire EQ career, until
lvl 60, where they basically run roughshod over everyone on the server that
is unlucky enough to host them. Sure just about every server has one of
these guilds. Tunare has several. Those are just my thoughts. I would
welcome everyone's opinions / experiences regarding this.
