Way back in the day, when I was a wee low-50's mage hunting in the
Hole, the only way I could take aggro from a ranger using tangling
weeds+flame lick was to chain Scars of Sigil (In the day when clicking
an insta clicky would refresh you spell gems I could get one off every
~2 seconds)  After delivering 2k of damage over <10 seconds the Golem
would ponderously turn and head my way, then almost instantly turn back
when the ranger cast flame-lick.

This, however, is only anecdotal.
