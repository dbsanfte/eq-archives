Hey Jazz (or others),

Growing tired of LoIO and want to try other places

I know you spent alot of time in HH and keep for early 20's or so... As a
fellow Troll, I would like to check it out.  What is the safest route to get
there? Where did you bind?  What about merchants and bank?

Also, any general tips you can give me for the keep would be appreciated.
Sorry if you posted this info in the past, I can't seem to find any old
related posts on my news server.
