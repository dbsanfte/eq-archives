As long as the cleric is keeping an eye on the health, fine.  But I'm not 
going to stand there until I'm so weak that even SoW doesn't help me 
outrun them.  Last night I died because the cleric was in there fighting 
and apparently forgot to watch the group health, because I said "can I 
get a heal, please?" at one bubble, and after no response, I backed up, 
saw him hitting, backed up a little more trying to get them off for a 
second so I could heal myself a bit, and - died.  At least he was 
apologetic, but it was highly frustrating because I was at the very edge 
of dinging 17 - and never made it.

It didn't help that someone decided a good joke would be to pull the 
specs several times last night - everytime we turned around there'd be a 
train of them coming after us.  Bodies everywhere, of course - and then 
they'd head for the docks, again with someone pulling them.  Basically, 
nowhere was safe.  Thank god a high-level necro was in the area.  He kept 
killing them off whenever they were pulled.  But a LOT of people died 
that night.
