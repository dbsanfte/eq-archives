You can target group members by clicking on their names in the group box or
hitting the appropriate F key, so that could be one way to do it.

You can also get a target by /assist on someone who has that target.
Combine that with the group thing, or someone with tracking, or (I've heard,
but don't know the details) some trick with Eye of Zomm, and the Necro
should be able to target everyone.
