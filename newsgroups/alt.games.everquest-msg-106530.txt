  Calling it a screenshot is kind of weird, because it's not a graphic,
because we're dealing purely with text (and maybe some hidden data) here, so
it's more like a log.

  I agree with you, they probably don't.  I was only saying that just
because those report logs are stored server side, doesn't necessarily mean
they can't be accessed by someone with the proper authorization remotely.
