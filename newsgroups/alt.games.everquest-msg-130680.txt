So, you are of the opinion that anytime someone is killed, it is
terrorism??

Jeezze and people in ADH thought *MY* definition of terrorism was
broad...

Yes, I saw that..

It was unfortuanate that he choose his camera angle adjacent to a
Palestinian fighting position. I don't recall exactly what it was, a
bunker or a building.  But that was the Israeli's target, not the
photographer.

Again, collateral damage.  Not terrorism...

How it started is not relevant to the discussion at hand.

"Is terrorism ever justified?"

Simple.. In the context of a discussion of what qualifies as
"terrorism" you bring up an issue of three people being arrested by
the US for celebrating the 9/11 attacks.

Ergo, a logical conclusion is that you are using that example to
illustrate that the US is committing terrorism.  

I simply wanted to confirm if that was, indeed, your intent..
