Speaking of Skyfire (and yes... I know I'm dragging this off onto a
completely unrelated issue) has anyone noticed something of a "bump" up
in the drop rates and quality in SF recently?

We were there the other night, granted not for long, and out of the
first five mobs we got three drops that included a 58 shammy and 57
druid spell. (Bonds of Tunare and whatever the 58 shammy "talisman of
something" spell is) and then a bunch more, though not of that level.
Seemed to be falling like rain. Yeah, could have just been a run of
REALLY good luck, but with VI's comments about improving certain drop
rates, balancing casters, etc. I was just curious if any of you regular
Skyfire hunters have noticed this?
