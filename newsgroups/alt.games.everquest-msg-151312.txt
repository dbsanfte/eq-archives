It does! I was very worried because it's such an expensive material to fail
on, and I was trying to add value to the acrylia ore because the market is
so flooded, but i'm not sure that it's worth it when people seem happier to
buy the ore for 70 than the processed material for  100 (say).

I just checked the market and people are selling acrylia boning for less
than the cost of the ore. My brain hurts. ;-)
