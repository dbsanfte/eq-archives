I have a lvl 8 mage (agnostic), a lvl 1 enchanter (Innoruuk), and a lvl 2 SK
(Innoruuk).  I have been able to hail both NPCs in the Necro guild that have
quests but when I say the words in the [] then don't answer back or respond
like the other characters with quests do.  Has anyone els had this problem?
