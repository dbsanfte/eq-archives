AOL doesn't connect to the internet like most ISPs do.  They release the
buggiest, most proprietary crapola yet still manage to keep an enormous
customer base through media blitzing.
Kind of like Microsoft.
Seriously, you're almost better off digging up and old 6.0 disk and
reinstalling.  Even better, dump it for good and get some no-name ISP.  If
you don't need all of AOL's little boring chat rooms and stuff you would be
happier in the long run without it.
Good luck!
