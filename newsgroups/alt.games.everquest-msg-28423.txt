I fletched my trushot on the 6th attempt with a skill of less than 70. I
forget exactly what it was.. 64 maybe? I was using the fletchiing guide on
the web, and had stopped when my skill making arrows hit the number in the
mid sixties.

Anyway.. get yourself a stack or two of the required components, and have at
it.... You might be pleasantly surprised.

I've got just a few components left, and am thinking of having a friend hold
my Trueshot, and trying again with the remaining components just to see what
happens.

Good luck!
