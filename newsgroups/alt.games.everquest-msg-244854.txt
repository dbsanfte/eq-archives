There are advantages to each.   Aborting a pull is the monks advantage.
Although, with an enchanter there, I don't see it as that much of an issue.
(1)  If bad pathing causes an add or brings a wanderer,  the cleric goes
linkdead or whatever, just have the enchanter mez the mobs and hold them
until you're ready.   The only  truly bad situations will be the times when
pacify is resisted, bringing the whole room.   And those will be an issue
with either a monk or rogue doing the final hit to bring them to the group.

A rogue has advantages too.  Sneak doesn't fail with a rogue.  You're not
just having to stay behind them, you're fully invisible.   Also you can
disarm any traps in the room to save some damage from that.   The rogue has
better methods of ditching the extra aggro from pulling.  If a Rogue has
escape, they can also abort a bad pull, but only once every so often, not on
every pull.

As I said above, the aggro is the rogues advantage, not the monks.  The
rogue does not have to feign death and stop doing damage to lose aggro.
Just evade as soon as you get back to the group for the same effect with a
much, much lower loss of dps.

Monks can take damage better, if they have stonestance and use it.   But
when I'm pulling, I don't take all that many hits.   You can set up closer
to the room than a monk since you don't need the extra room to feign death /
escape.    It's not like you're leading them through 5 rooms at walking
speed.   Unless you're pulling a caster, (which would hurt a monk equally to
a rogue)  it should be really rare that you're taking any damage until you
get back to the group.   At which point the two pulling advantages balance
each other out.  The rogue ditches aggro with evade, and the monk either
uses stonestance and takes some hits, or feigns and lets the tank grab it.

(1) Before 15 people say "but what if there isn't an enchanter?!?"... It was
a given in this scenario that an enchanter would be there.
