}Nobody should interfere with me interfering. Case reopened!

Well, that's a good line, at least.

}I've heard that EQ is a 'multi-player' game. Rumor has it that people
}interfere with each other (one way or another) on a regular basis.

Yes. and there's good ways to interfere, and bad ways to interfere.

}I would have to say that more people were happy with my 'interfering' than
}ones who expressed displeasure at it. Since the vat majority seem to enjoy
}my 'interfering', I shall continue to do so until the ones who are angry at
}the unrequested heals and buffs I throw them get me banned.

Note that there's a big difference between unrequested heals and buffs, 
which allow one to finish whatever fight themselves and still feel a sense 
of accomplishment, and nuking/betaing the mob someone's enjoying fighting 
to death right before their eyes.

And unrequested heals and buffs aren't always good...

Character with low hit points, having just finished a fight...

Misterhealy begins to cast a spell...
You feel much better!
You cannot be bandaged past 50% of your max hit points

Ngaaah!  Now I have to go get wounded again so I can get my blinkin' Bind 
Wounds up!

Hey, I just got breeze!  All casters love breeze, don't they?  Oh.  Hmm.  
Why is this necro annoyed with me?  All I did was try to help him...
