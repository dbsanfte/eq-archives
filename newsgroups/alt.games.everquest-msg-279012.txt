The point is that not everything scales at the same rate.  I don't think hit
points changed, so scaling up damage overall is going to make for shorter
fights.  And since they've changed how stats affect things, it's going to
scale differently for different classes and different individuals, changing
the balance of the game. 

Unfortunately, Sony doesn't believe in sharing the overall design goals, or
what problems they think they're addressing with any given change, so
it's impossible to guess what they're actually trying to do.  And they don't
(historically, at least) understand how the actual complex system of the game
actually works for a lot of players, so it's impossible for them to guess
either.

(Despite this, they somehow manage to make games that have a lot of fun
available in them.)
