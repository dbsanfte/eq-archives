These two statements seem to contradict each other.  I agree with the
second, because after experimenting I've gotten it to work.  But the
first statement doesn't quite work, because he asks for 4 whiskers,
and if you give him _exactly_ 4 whiskers you will probably not get a
reward.  Although literally, he just wanted the whiskers "brought" to
him, and it took a while to figure out that there wasn't going to be a
conversational way to let him know this.
