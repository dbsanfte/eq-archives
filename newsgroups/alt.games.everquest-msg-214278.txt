yes ive play both doac and swg. i didnt like doac because the characters
were cookie cutters and i like the challenge of stat building not to mention
how slllooow the game characters were! swg was boring because im not that
into star wars/scifi settings and nothing to do but missions :( i did like
the solo ability in swg though :) thats another thing i think i wont like in
EQ-- the grouping, that bothered me in doac.
I should just try it like i did the others the investment is not that high
actually. Thanks for the feedback as you can see im undesided. :)
