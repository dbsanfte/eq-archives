No way. Hands down the worst newbie zone was Toxx forest. Trust me.
Nek was a paradise compared to Toxx. Dark! and it was newbie ground
to a nightblind race! Hello? Then its filled with fog! Hello?

Steamfont sucked rocks as well. Especially for level 7-8, everything was
either green or yellow, nothing inbetween.  Not good when you are a caster
with little or no gear. And you had to walk a quarter mile to even 'get' to the
newbie mobs. Also it had camps of kobolds that were level 8-9
surrounded by wandering mobs that were 11-12?!?!? Who the fuck
designed that zone?

Yes good changes.
