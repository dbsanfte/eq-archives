LOL, you can take a Green solo? <sigh> If only I could.

Whether this was by design or not, I recon not but players just adapted and
thats the way the game went on from there. Verant have always stated that
the game was designed for group play and not solo so no one ever complains.
Basically at high level (46 +) you can forget the con system as you once
knew it.

Warriors con at 50th;

Green - This can mean a Skeleton, Dies on hit from a 2hdr or A mob in it's
mid 30's (some 15! levels lower than you) could still rip you a new one and
even if you did win you wouldn't get exp. Some of the Higher ones will give
exp (and will kill you solo) but you have no way of telling them from a
Gnoll pup by using con.

Blue - Bring a friend...or 2 one better had be a healer.

Yellow - Need a group, 3 players could do it as long as you have plenty of
heals, Druid AND Shaman or a Cleric and any other class.

Red -  Full group, minimum. More than one melee (Don't care which, Rogue or
Monk to dish out the damage or another tank to pick up the aggro if needed)
and Cleric essential. Of course red can often mean Bring a group, sorry I
mean Guild but it is normally easy to spot these mobs.

There are points in levelling where you get extra messages (Greens that say
they could pose problems and Blues that say they are formidable or that it
looks like a gamble but you should win) what is odd is that as you get
higher level these disappear where they really are needed.

These are not miss cons as such, Blue means formidable but formidable now
means don't try it without back up (unless you're a Necro)
