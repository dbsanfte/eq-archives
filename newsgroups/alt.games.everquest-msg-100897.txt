To be totally honest, I have called up my cable company regarding a problem
more often than I have petitioned regarding a problem in EQ.

Personally, I'd rather see them keep the cost down, the customer service
they have offered has been perfectly acceptable to me.  I have petitioned a
grand total of 4 times, once out of those 4, at around 1AM pacific time, it
went unanswered for the 20 minutes I stayed on waiting.  When I petitioned
again in the morning it was answered within 10 minutes to my satisfaction.

I seriously doubt anyone is going to be talking about this price hike within
a few months, except for a few die hard "I'm gonna quit" type of folks.  The
SoL release will probably continue to be discussed for some time however.
