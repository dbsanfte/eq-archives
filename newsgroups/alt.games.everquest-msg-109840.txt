Judged only on that they both sound eaqual to me :

Injured > Lower Agi > Slower 

vs

Injured > Lower Agi
Injured > Slower

However the results of tests posted here previously seem to show that
AGI has no direct effect on speed. (At least for the tests that were
done)

You are claiming a counter example, perhaps more / new test are in order
?

For the momnet I will continue to believe the tested rather than the
observed.
