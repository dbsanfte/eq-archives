Well, I've about had it with my ISP's news server.  I posted a small
chunk from the EQ2 FAQ the other day and asked if the way the game 
behaved was, in fact, different from the way it was supposed to 
(according to the FAQ).  I saw my original post, but haven't seen any
of the follow-ups.  I went to google and found there was some lively
discussion, however.  So, now I'm sure it's dropping a huge number of 
messages.

Any reccomendations?
