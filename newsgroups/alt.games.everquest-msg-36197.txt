No, the formula to determine the xp loss is the same, and it's based
off the xp it took to get through the previous level. Trust me, I
didn't lose a *FULL* amber bubble of xp in lvl 29 or 32, but I sure as
hell did in 31. 31 doesn't require any less than the normal scaling
amount of xp to get through than 32 or 29.
