They have addressed that issue many times.

I can tell you what they will say, or rather how you will interpret
their answer anyway:

Q: Will there be more content for the soloing minimal time player in the
 expansion?

A: No. This is a grouping game. If you don't want to group play another
game or play a Necro. =)

Q: Do you understand the needs of the minimal time player?

A: We did not design the game for a 'minimal time player' so we don't care. =)

Its a fact of the game, it takes time and effort to play in certain areas and
certain aspects of the game. I must tell you that I am one of those 'minimal
time players' I have only gone on a few big raids, I have never been
in an uber-guild capable of going to the planes or dragons. Yet I still find
plenty to do in the game and can still enjoy it. Imagine that.

The game is what you make of it.
