I bow to your uberness.  To be able to pull 4 mobs at once in a 65
hard is impressive.  None of the groups I have ever been in would have
survived.  But any bard that pulls like that for any but the most uber
group is not doing his job.  In almost all cases a long pull with a
single mob arriving at a time is extremely preferable.
