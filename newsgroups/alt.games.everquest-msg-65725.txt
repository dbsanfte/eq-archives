Finally patched last night after SOL went live.  Haven't purchased
expansion yet, Im gonna wait a bit til some of the bugs are worked out.
Patch went fine, logged in and played around a bit with a couple
different characters to see what was new.  I found that everything ran
surprisingly smooth except:

1.  Occasionally in Misty Thicket and then later in North Karana after
patching a late patch close to midnight EST, I get a strange fluttering
video image like flickering bat wings to the left side of the screen.

2.  Also on occasion, the ground plane disappears and is replaced by a
mirror of the sky.

3.  Finally, had some instances where a building would disappear from
view revealing all the contents or people inside (Like X-ray vision).

Since I had installed DirectX 8.1 and have the current video drivers
installed for my ATI Radeon 64mb DDR card (OEM from Gateway), I don't
know if I should believe it is my video card or just some random bugs
that aren't fixed yet.  On the whole things run fine and in fact better
than they used too.  My SB Live card sounds better than it ever has with
EQ.  It's still a little buggy but light years better than before.  I
actually zone faster than before SOL release which I was amazed to find
considering I play on a 26.4K dial-up (one step faster than the pony
express =).  And the colors, lighting and graphics are much richer than
before, although the gamma correction doesnt work (little brighter than
I would prefer).

Just curious if others are having random video bugs like I described or
should I look at re installing my video drivers or something even
different all together.  Unfortunately my skills with computer hardware
/ software does not include Video Cards (bad luck installing and
diagnosing them in past).  Gateway insists that the video driver from
their site is the one I should use and not necessarily the one on the
ATI site (any Gateway users tried the ATI drivers from ATI?) Any
thoughts would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Moriarty
