A handful of times in the past two years I've logged on
to a friend's account (at their request) to do something
that they couldn't do themselves for one reason or
another

One example: They were visiting friends hours
from home and playing their character on their friends'
EQ computer.  They died and went back to their bind
point in the Nexus, only to discover that the computer
they were playing on didn't have Luclin installed.  Oops.
So they phoned me and asked me to log in their character
on my Luclin-enabled computer and move them out of Luclin
so that they could then log back on on the Luclin-less
computer and resume play.

In every case, I've insisted that they change their
password as soon as they log back on after I've finished.
That way, if their account ever gets messed with anytime
down the road, I won't be on the list of suspects.
