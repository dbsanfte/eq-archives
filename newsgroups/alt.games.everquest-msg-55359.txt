And just out of curiosity, I ran the same setup through Copeland with
varying strengths (1,75,100,150,200,255), with the same result.  The slower,
higher damage weapon was better.  But this is more because the speed
difference is minimal compared to the damage difference in the weapons.
Obviously, with a larger disparity, you will find that a faster, but lower
damage, weapon in the main hand will be better.  I'm sure that a formula
could be created to figure this out, but I am way to lazy, just run it
through Copeland, and see what works best for you.
