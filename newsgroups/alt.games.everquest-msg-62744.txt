Yeah, from the start EQ acted unlike any other game out there in terms of
odd hardware issues.  I can't really explain it.

As to finding an alternative to EQ, good luck, a comparable game still isn't
out there (DAOC had some hopes and may one day qualify).  If you're going to
live with an inferior MMORPG it probably won't be for that long, if you're
ANYTHING like me.

Reformat, update DX, use the latest sound driver and second-latest video
driver (to be safe), if Geforce2 and try again.  Do the Via patch if YOU can
figure out if you need to (that very well may be my problem with sound in
W2k, but for the life of me I can't figure out what to download and install,
if I need to at all, or if it'll hurt anything if I say "what the hell" and
install it anyway).

Win2k isn't a "gaming PC" but it does a pretty damned fine job of it.  You
shouldn't be having a lot of problems with it, especially not a clean
machine.
