Ignoring the "u" which would get you no buffs on sheer principle, I
freely buff people unsolicited if they're just around where I happen
to be, and will, if I'm not busy, buff anyone who offers to pay for
them for free as long as they come to me.

But people who just demand them? Not very often.

One of my favorite memories was sitting on the dock in Oasis for some
reason or other, watching a nearby group struggle with the crocs they
were fighting; not a twink in the bunch and the high level dws were
giving them a hard time, but they were having a good time trying
anyways. I offered one of them a group buff, when she said sure I
mentioned I'd need to be grouped with them to give it. After some
debating one of them disbanded for a second and they invited me... and
got PotG+group regrowth. They never even came close to dying after
that, and the increased mana regen meant they were killing about twice
as fast too. They'd never had anything like it before.

In the meantime, the guy sitting on the dock going "sow me plz" I was
*cough* afk for.
