There are also augs that may be purchased with adventure points that give
things like Ultravision (/wave humans and barbarians), see invisible,
assorted focus effects, and flowing thought.

Much of the LDoN gear has multiple augmentation slots, so +6 per slot
isn't the limit. (The mana/HP augs I've seen have been +12, but haven't
been popular.)

I've had the ID4 belt drop in a group that I was in (and I've only
been in a handful of Takhisis advenures). I've also had a breastplate
drop that was 56 AC, +80 HP, and a bunch of other stats that I can't
recall. Basically the minibosses drop gear that is almost always an
upgrade for *somebody* in the group.

Since a "normal" 65 adventure gives 51 points, and elemental-level
gear may be purchased for 1460 or so points, 29 adventures (say 60
hours of play) will earn the player an item of elemental (or at least
Tier 3) level. That's not a bad deal; probably a better ratio than
most players will get.

Plus of course those 60 hours are reasonably interesting to play and
give a good chance of *other* good loot, and about 200-250 plat per
adventure in cash and gems. Most MOBs drop 10-17 plat, and gems
are common.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
