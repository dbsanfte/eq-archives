Not for solo play Ed.  The game only really seems to be fun when
you've got folks you group/socialize with regularly.  Good things
(really fun battles, highly entertaining social interaction, new
new places to hunt because you've gained levels and/or neat loot,
& etc.) just come so slow after 35 or so when you play solo.  A
family-style guild where most members make an effort to group with
guildies is probably the best bet.  I made it to 55 with Kaev and
then abandoned him, because I just couldn't seem to be on at the
right times to group/raid with the folks in my guild who were so
inclined.  I probably got half his xp between 35 and 55 solo, and
it was boring as hell.  Just ask the regulars in the a.g.e channel
from back then how much I babbled in the channel, just looking for
someone to talk to.

Wizard needs mana regen buff(s) (and items) and nice "touch" to
be really effective.  At high level he'll have the mana regen and
should have learned agro management.  At 24 you're not gonna be
competing in terms of raw DPS, but you can make a group more
effective and with the group xp changes people should be more
willing to give you a chance.  Just keep in mind that you won't
add much to a "grind" group that is already handling everything
just fine with no real risk. It's the groups closer to the edge
that sometimes have their existence hanging by a thread who can
really benefit from your ability to make a mob turn or die ASAP,
or kite a mob away from that poor Druid who just got heal agro
from an add but still needs to keep the tank alive.
