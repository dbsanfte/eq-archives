Six months is stretching it, in the game business it's more like 3 and
that's for feature stories and some reviews. News articles can slip in at
the last minute as they're going to press, and that's more like 30 days lead
time (at least, that's how it worked long ago when I wrote for Computer
Games Magazine). Still, your point is completely valid -- relying on
magazines for something as dynamic as a game release date is ludicrous.

I'm curious what leads you to this conclusion. I don't necessarily dispute
it, I just hadn't thought of EQ2 in that light before so I'm curious what
specifics about the game lead you to the conclusion.

You could make the same argument against End-of-Life'ing any software
product, and yet EOL happens every day in the software business. In the
enterprise software business we typically include EOL as part of the entire
software product lifecycle and often will include specific plans on how and
when to implement, the idea being that with some products we *want* people
to make this "sideways" move and migrate to the new platform because we
believe that the new platform has legs that the old one does not. It may be
viewed as revenue-neutral initially because it's a "sideways" move, but
again, we're looking for growth opportunities and if we have a platform that
allows us to broaden our servicable market via new features unattainable in
the prior platform, that's growth and that's a win. We'll usually continue
to support the prior platform for x period of time with regular and public
pronouncements of the termination points, giving everyone the opportunity to
transition.

It really depends on the products in question, but this approach makes far
more sense in my opinion than trying to maintain simultaneously two
identical products serving the same market. Now, if they're serving
different markets, that's a whole different issue and then you're just
talking about a product line with different components for different
segments. It sounds to me like you're saying that they do in fact serve
different markets, with EQ2 being aimed at the casual gamer and EQ directed
at the more hard core gamer (whatever those terms mean). Honestly, I haven't
looked at EQ2 closely enough to know how it stacks up here, so I'm eager to
hear your answer to my question above.
