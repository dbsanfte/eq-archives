Subject: How to say no / ignore list?

I have 8 people total on my ignore list.  Twice over I've had the misfortune to
end up with ignore-ees in my group again (2 different ones).  Both times I sent
a tell to the GL just stating that "*joe* is on my ignore list".  Both times
the GL /told me he was letting them play anyway.  Both times we were sorry.
When you are the cleric how do you go about refusing to play with *Ignore-ee*
without sounding like a petulant brat?  I hate to just say "/g sorry, can't
play after all" and disband when it's often taken a bit of time to get the
group together and there aren't a lot of clerics out there.  On the other hand
I don't want to "/g if you let Ignore-ee play I'm not playing" either because
that sounds pretty lame too.
