Warrens has the lowest bronze dropping mobs that im aware of. After looting
your rusty sword from a lvl 1 mobs, you could go and solo warrens easily.
Selling may be inconveneint tho. Good races would probably have to sell in
tox forest outside erudin, if they arnt dubios already.
Karana bandits and the associated sash quest would be easily doable with a
rusty sword.

Ive got my doubts about soloing HG's in bronze. I think your only option for
HG's is to delevel and get a partner. Good luck on finding a partner that
can use a warrior in rm. Its not an option I would consider.

Best (cheesy) option tho imo is to put the character on hold, start a necro
or druid, get some levels and go farm giants in style.
