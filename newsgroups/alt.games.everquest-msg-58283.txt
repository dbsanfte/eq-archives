I am about 90percent certain i have seen it there.  Check all of the
vendors, some sell spells that are for shadowknights, that might look
like you're at the necro vendor when you're not.  My personal opinon of
the level 1 pet is to wait until level 4 and buy that one.  1-4 IMO you
don't really need your pet, and you don't have to worry about it
outdamaging you, which when first starting takes some time to learn.
Most of the other level one spells are well worth it again IMO, YMMV.
