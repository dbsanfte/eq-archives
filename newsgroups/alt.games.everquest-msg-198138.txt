    Before, we were on pure officer reward. Or so it was thought. Actually,
the officers did track attendance in the background and used those numbers
as one of their guidelines when awarding items. I suspected there was more
to loot than just pure officer reward based on specific comments by
officers, so during one of the many, many, many threads on points versus
merit on our message boards I baited one of the more volatile officers and
drew everything out of him. Well, now that everyone knows that attendance
counts, the points nazis have been pushing harder than ever for a full
points system. Showing attendance, and that attendance does change what type
of loot you can receive, is a step towards full-blown points.

    It's the age-old debate. Nobody thinks that they're getting their "fair
share", ever. Pro-points people feel that they'd be in better control of
what they get as rewards with points, and many believe that they would get
anything they wanted under points. Officer rewards people don't believe that
a strong guild is built by a glutton-based system where, to use an example
from a rival guild, the best rogue piercer in the game (Ifir) goes to a
bard. The two sides will never see eye-to-eye, and every discussion tears
open old wounds. It's the abortion debate of Everquest.

    Here's the full text from our "Wanna join?" post on the message board,
spelling mistakes and all:

 -- Who we are --

First and foremost, Lotus Cult is a serious raiding guild. We raid every day
typically around U.S. EST/PST evening hours. If you do not love to raid, or
if dying makes you squemish, or your main draw to everquest is gnome
cyber... then you have come to the wrong place! (well, except for gnome
cyber, send me a tell after raid hours~).

We have also always been a guild of friends and tried to foster a positive
atmosphere. As our numbers have grown and our goals have increased, we
strive to preserve this atmosphere to the maximum extent possible. We
believe in Karma, and try to treat other guilds and individuals with respect
and fairness while striving to achieve our guild goals.
Training/harassing/exploiting and other such naughty behaviour is not
supported or tolerated.

-- What is expected of you --

We have quite a few members now, and only so many raid slots available for
new recruits. Typically we will recruit to meet class balance or raid
requirements only as much as is required to get the job done. This means we
are usually pretty selective in our recruiting. We are only interested in
recruiting <b>full time skilled players who love to raid a LOT.</b> As a
metric, our average full time members raid at least 6 days per week with
typically 30 or more raid hours per week. Your play times will be expected
to be commensurate with this DURING RAID HOURS.

There are no required play hours outside of raid time, except as you desire
for your own fun! The guild will usually not support individual quests or
efforts (such as epics or ring wars, etc.) during raid times unless no other
targets are planned. These type of events are usually done with smaller
numbers of people arranged by the individual themself outside of normal raid
hours.

Many of the upper end zones have pretty intensive graphics. This coupled
with 60+ people can often bring most computers and internet connections to a
screeching halt. If you cannot play due to internet lag or video lag, then
you really can't do much to help the raid. You should ensure your system and
internet connection is stable enough to support this. As a rule of thumb,
1500MhZ+ Geforce3+ 512MB ram and a broadband internet connection are the
minimum setups that our members have.

-- Loot --

When a piece of loot drops, personnel desiring the loot send tells to an
officer (with a link of the item to be replaced). The Officers of the guild
distribute loot based on several factors. Foremost among these is
attendance, which is closely tracked and recorded during raid hours. We also
consider the amount of upgrade for the individuals, impact of focus or item
effects, and the needs of the guild. Ultimately, the officers make the final
decisions with respect to loot. In the event no one asks for a specific
piece of loot, that item is rolled for ALL applicable classes. Members who
have lost full time status AND recruits can still obtain loot in this
fashion. Over time the amount of loot that is obtained will be proportional
to the effort that is expended.

-- The Recruiting Process --

For open classes, recruits will be nominated from within the guild or by
sending me (or another) officer a tell. DO NOT send me tells in game if
recruiting is closed for your class. We will update this post as slots
become available. Typically myself, Trabious, or Axxan discuss recruiting
requirements.

Once you are nominated, the Officers and class POCs will generally decide
within 1-3 days whether to allow you to recruit. Once you are designated as
a recruit, you will be expected to participate on every raid from that day
forth with the guild. Your skill and playtime will be evaluated. Once you
are a recruit, you will need a sponsor. This is usually a friend of the
recruit, or the person who nominated them, but can be anyone in the guild.
This person will keep you informed of raids and keep the officers informed
of your status.

After a nominal period of one week, you will either be made official or let
go. More time may be required if there are questions, issues, or if play
time for that specific week is low for a reason. Your sponsor or one of the
recruiting officers can discuss delays in this portion of the process.

The act of becoming official means that we like what we see so far and
desire to recruit your class. In short, you should get in as long as skill
and play time remain commensurate with our needs. Typically this period will
also be one week... but may extend if there are issues or concerns to be
resolved.

-- Recruiting Status --

Lotus Cult is ALWAYS seeking to recruit HIGHLY talented players with solid
play time regardless of class balance. In order to fall into this category,
you should have an integrated understanding of all aspects of the game such
as pulling, debuffing, mob abilities, player abilities, tactical
positioning, Grouping, and other raid planning aspects.

Additionally, the following classes have space allowed within class balance
goals and recruiting is open as follows:

Bard (1)
Beastlord (1)
Cleric (1-2)
Mage (2)
Monk (1-2) - 2 Recruits in progress
Paladin (1) - 1 recruit in progress
Wizard (1)

The minimum requirements for ALL recruits are level 65. Specific
requirements by class / ability are:

Bard - 75aa+
Beastlord - 75aa+ Required: ND3, PE, pet discipline, Paragon, Ambi, Frenzy5,
CA3 Desireable: SuspendMinion2, LR5

AA modified 4/17

Note: These requirements are being developed to be as specific as possible
for what we need of new members. As such, they are constantly updated. Ask
your Sponsor what the most up to date requirements are until I get these
updated.

    Ok, so that's the "official" requirements. Unofficially, it's a fair bit
looser than what is presented. The requirements are set high so that people
who come to us are serious, and not the sort of player that will join and
then slack off. In particular, I think maybe a third of our clerics or less
could meet our own recruitment requirements now. That average time per week
listed for full time members is about right, BTW. We have people that
average as high as 200 hours raiding in a four week period. But as I showed
you, many of our current members aren't full time. We just don't want to
recruit someone that won't be full time.

    You'd be surprised how far you can go in the game today. My married
friend can play maybe two times a week for a few hours at most. He's got a
55 rogue one step away from his epic, a 52 cleric, and a small number of
pre-50 twinks, and I've never PL'ed him. As a matter of fact, that rogue did
a lot of the early levelling solo (gah, still makes me cringe to think how
much time he wasted doing that).
