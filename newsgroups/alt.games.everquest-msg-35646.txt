Having just started a Barbarian Shaman in Halas, I have naturally used a 
lot of time in the newbie area of Everfrost Peaks.

I've noticed that other PC 'disappear' on a regular basis, but only the 
image, so to speak. I can't see them, but they are still present. In the 
cases where a PC targeted for buffs made a 'disappearing act', during 
combat, it was possible to see the health bar diminish - and the 
attacking mob, but not the PC. BTW casting on the PC was not possible 
either.

Is this a bug, something other people has noticed - or should I adjust 
my medication :o)

Best Regards
