If you're an ignorant little twit snipping a bit out of context and
making this sort of stupid reply you likely don't realize that I've
been playing for 3.5 years and never questioned the OP's choice to
anchor the group around a Shaman.  If you're reading comprehension
still hasn't reached that of the average twelve-year-old you won't
understand that my post was a direct reponse to the assertion that
a Shaman makes a Druid redundant.  If you're a mindless troll with
shit for brains you can bet I won't trouble myself to read any more
of your posts anytime soon.
