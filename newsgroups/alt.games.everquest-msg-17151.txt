It's like driving up to somebody, slinging your car door open without a word
and waiting for them to get in the car. Or like somebody walking up to you
in the mall, standing in front of you, spouting out "follow me," then
walking off.

Either very creepy or coming from somebody with an amazing lack of social
skills. The answer to drive by invites is always "reject."
