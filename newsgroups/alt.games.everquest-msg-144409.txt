Decent compared to what? An enchanter pet? Certainly not decent compared
to Wiz, ranger, rogue, monk, and probably a host of other classes

Easily overcome by knowning who the next MT is, and spamming them with
smaller fastcasting heals the second the frst MT dies, to buy time for
the rotation to lock on. Not easily overcome by having a dozen warriors
standing around just in case.

And when all 8 other non-first-MT warriors all hit that button at the
same time, then what? Oh yeah, the entire raid rolls over and plays
dead, because the healers aren't all on the same tank.
