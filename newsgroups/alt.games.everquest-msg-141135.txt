Yep, 3 tick dots.  First is level 2, CoD (Chords
of Dissonance) AE dot, does more damage with a 
lute equipped, and gets more damaging as they level.
2nd - song 18, DDD (can't remember what the initials
stand for) again AE - 3 ticks, but uses brass
instruments.  A well armored bard can start doing
all instrument, multiple mob killing at 18  by 
weaving 2, 18 and 6 while switching the lute to the
horn before 18.  Later on bards get single target,
3 tick dots, Fufil's Curtailing Chant (saves against
MR, reduces MR, as well as the dot effect),
chant of flame (save vs. FR, reduces FR) and chant
of frost (save vs. CR reduces CR) all are boosted
by a drum.

These are all true DoT's (they do damage) just some
have extra effects (does DDD reduce AC as well?  Think
so, been a LOOOONG time since my bard was my main).

I really think they are going to make only the damage
portion of dot's stick, not the extra movement/ac/resist
reduction on many of them.
