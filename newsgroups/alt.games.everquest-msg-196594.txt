Basicly root works better in single player situations where you have to
worry about them running, you have root, so don't sweat it.  my cleric
tends to use her symbol anyway, just because she's a sissy, and the few
hp she might save by being beat on for 6 seconds vs. rooted for who
knows how long is something.  Yes it's usefull, but enough to make a
character just to use it no.  If I'd known before I got it I would have
never restarted my cleric (was an assling) as a DE, but I like this
character better now any way, so it's all good.  I am getting slightly
annoyed by the faction issues though.  I've been killing undead froggies
in guk for 5 levels and the live ones still hate my guts.  Mabye I'll
make em pay some day for kicking the trolls out and making them seek
refuge in our city, smelling the place up.  D'you know they don't even
use toilets?  they just do it in the once clean waterways of our once
beutiful city.

A monk's dps is pretty serious especially when hasted, which you can
do.  Also you have damage mitigation in slow.  Of course a rogue would
probably be as good or better, if you can hold agro.
