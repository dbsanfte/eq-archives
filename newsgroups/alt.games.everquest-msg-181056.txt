The only place in the "old" world where you have a reliable supply of
easy 57+ mobs is juggs in Seb.  Every other spot will have louse exp
due to either not enough mobs (Guardian wurms in SF) or mobs with way
to many HP to kill fast (UP). CT has the mobs, but it's very tricky to
keep the mobs of the healer since they increased the aggro on druid
CH. Ignore the last half sentence if you're dual wielding SoDs and can
generate all the aggro you need.
