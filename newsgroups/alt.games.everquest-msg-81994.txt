Toot!  Toot! Tthe flute of high authority has sounded, as the argument
implodes by reason of no other cluelessness than that.

Damn.  You really believe that?  Tell you what, Pastorio, had you the least
iota of education in your head, the first thing you'd have learned is how
not to think after such a manner that you make priests of people in black
square hats, and temples of the classrooms they inhabit.  To say that a
person is "educated" means absolutely nothing, as it bears not one iota of
weight upon the issue of how honestly that education is being used.

You better stick to your education in reciper for Rigatoni, Pastorio.
