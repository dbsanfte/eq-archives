Actually, I beleive the policy says "may not" not "will not" or "can
not". "May not" means it's a judgement call by the GM who handles the
situation. You'll find a lot of "may not"s in the policies. Setting in
stone too many "can not"s is a bad idea, as some cases might warrant a
return depending on the specific conditions...
