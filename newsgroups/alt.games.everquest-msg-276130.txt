Part of this is because since almost all equipment must be attuned,
there are fewer cast-offs on the brokers. Another part is an
understandable dsire to not clutter the game up with junk. If there's
a hundred different daggers, but only one any actually USES, there's
really only one dagger. Most of the EQ2 items are balanced for their
level, so that any one is as good as another. Apart from some rare
uber-items, all the items are 'good'.

They are adding more art and 'looks' to items, though. It's an ongoing
process.
