Well  I said if possible...  I do not EXPECT it...  but if there is a 29+
level druid guildie in the same zone or close....  Why not?  EXPECTING is
for children...  I will run across the world if a port is not available...
But hey, I'd rather fly than take the bus anyday.

Wouldnt you appreciate the Rez if a high level cleric from your guild was
nearby?
