Dulak (LoY) is a 50+ (ish) zone with a few wandering Dock Patrolman
iksars, but the REAL source of Iksar blood in Dulak is Ship 5 (I
believe it is Windscorn?). Many of the mobs there are Iksar.

They are all low-mid 50's, casters including healers (CompHeal), SK'd,
necros etc. with LARGE aggro ranges and a fairly fast repop. They even
can agro from ship 4 if you sit on the side of ship 4 which is nearest
the ship 5 - you will see the ship 5 guys come boiling down the ramp
and try to get at you - some swim overboard and leap up at you, the
rest try (badly) to path to ship 4.

I would recomend a FULL group of mid-50s for ship5, preferably with
lots of melee skills and a spare healer. We did it with CLR, CLR, SHM,
SHD, PAL, WAR (I think) and found it fast and tough. We didn't manage
to get a toehold on the ship for very long, so I would recommend a
group of high 50's or a second group - it seems that a good place to
pull the ship once broken would be the very tip of the bow - from
there you can control the aggro ranges. There is no safe spot on ship
5 unlike the others.
