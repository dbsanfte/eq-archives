After 5:30 I was able to look again as my laughter no longer needed to be
surpressed and I found the smouldering sexuality that is...TREX...omfg...is
this guy for real?
As great as the ego's were of Anta and Jeera I would say the fall into the
runner up slots in comparison to this guy.

In case you think I am taking the piss out of someone with "unfortunate"
looks I am not (I am in no position to) these guys look like they've posted
pics for a dating agency...examples;

http://www.anzwers.org/free/antbay/images/people/j/jeera1.jpg
http://www.anzwers.org/free/antbay/images/people/t/trex4.jpg

Each of these have multiple pics, one would just not be enough to produce
the desired effect...whatever that was.

On the plus side, at least some people did it in the right frame of mind,
either finding a single pic of them looking "good" or something amusing,
like the guy asleep with a small dog on his head or another brushing his
teeth.

These sites would actually be quite boring if it wasn't for people wanting
to show how "cool" they are.
