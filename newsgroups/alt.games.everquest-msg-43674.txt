I love Kaesora.  True, Kaeosra is always uncamped, and it's because of the
danger/design of the dungeon.  It's built in a way that those who could hunt
in there for exp, would probably die horrible deaths with nightmarish CR.
Also, th location might also lead to its separateness.  However, with a
group of friends it can be a blast.  Everything in there is green to me now,
but I still always jump at the chance to get in there when somenoe I know
needs a Xalgoz fang.  The drops are quite decent also.  25% weight reduction
bags are common as flies, tombcarvers are decent rogue weapons and will make
you a hero to the low level rogue you give them to, and the 6 wis/int book
frmo the library is also quite nice.  Blade of Xalgoz isn't bad either
(note, not bad does not = great, for those in here who think that a weapon
is crap if it has anything worse than a 29/30 ratio)
