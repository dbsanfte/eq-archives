Actually I'd recommend starting a druid for your first char.  After you
are used to the game, start a real character :).

People hate druids because
1. More People Play Druids
2. More Idiots Percentage Playing Druids
3. Druids are the easiest class to play

That said I know a select few druids who are really good, and I'd
happily group with them any time.

I have refused to ever play a druid though.  Just can't bringmyself to
play the most hated class.  

P.S. - I think SOE should make a druid zone where all the Mobs are
Druids and you can kill them to get your frustrations out.
