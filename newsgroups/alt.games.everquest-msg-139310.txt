Hope this helps a little bit. The Bear Fangs along with Wolf and I
believe Panther Fangs make necklasses that you need for the Oracle
(Forgot his name) in the Fort located in the Basilisk Cave. Many "No
Drop" items are used in recipies that are in a recipie book that you
can't get until you "prove" your "worthiness" to the citizens of
JaggedPine. I have read recipes that use Griffon Meat and Potmeid Meat
but thats all so far. Hope this helps.
