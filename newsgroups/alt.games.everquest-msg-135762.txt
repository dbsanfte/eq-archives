After the boat zonef from TD to OT the boat will stand there for liek 3 mins
until it keep moving to the docks in OT.
when the boat is standing there then you can jump it off and swim... If you
face the boat forward you jump off to the left.. You can see land if you
have maxed clip plane.

Do danger at all to swim to shore. and yes its worth it.
XP in OT is good..
 Good luck.
