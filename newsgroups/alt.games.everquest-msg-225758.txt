Dodges would be Avoidance.  Mitigation is something else.  The tests 
I've seen by some include sitting while fighting various mobs to get 
maximum hits.  Doing so with both Warriors and other plate classes 
(usually Paladin) gives you a percentage of natural mitigation. 
Warriors take just under 4.5% less damage.
