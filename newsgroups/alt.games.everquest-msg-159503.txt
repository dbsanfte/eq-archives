Or heck, just ooc and ask if anyone has looted a doll.  People
slaughter those lizard quite regularly - not so often the camps but if
you see a group, they're likely bored as heck from trying to compete
with the high levels who are snagging the giants 2 or 3 at a time and
will gladly do a quick camp kill for you, if you're polite about it.

Our group slaughtered the camps just for something to do while we
waited for something to spawn long enough for us to grab it ;p
