  Careful.  Such dangerous use of logic can only result in more nerfs.

  Maybe it's because you can't make a Norrath-dial.

  Somebody probably thought it was "clever", without realizing how
stupid it actually is.  You know, the same way someone probably
thought "Ahh, I feel much better now" sounded like something cool and
scary that a necromancer or shadow knight would say.

  I really hope this "nerfage" doesn't make it impossible to tell real
life time, too...?  Verant couldn't be that dumb, though.  Right?
