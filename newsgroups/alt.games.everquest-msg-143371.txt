Yep, and hate is not a crime.  Murder, robbery, etc. are crimes,
however, and deserve whatever punishment the law allows.  The
idea should be to ensure law enforcement is unbiased not to
segregate crimes by victim.

I often find it ironic that organizations which profess to want a
bias-free society are usually at the fore in urging legislation
to recognize and formalize bias within legislative and administrative
law.
