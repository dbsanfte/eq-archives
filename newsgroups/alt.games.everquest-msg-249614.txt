I remember my first time in the karanas. I was *petrified*. I was
walking along those damn paths, my eyes WIDE open staring for
lions and every so often it go so frightening I'd just sit in an
inn for 10 minutes till everything outside had gone away. I didn't
realise they could still get me in an inn at that point ;)

Some 13 paladin met me at the EK bridge and was like 'WTF, you're
going to DIE, what are you DOING here?' while saving me from a lion.

Then I continued on my walk to Freeport. I was the only one to
survive from my group of 3. It ruled ;) I must have been about
level 6 ;)
