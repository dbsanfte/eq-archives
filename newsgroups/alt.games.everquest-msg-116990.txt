Lighting USED to be this bad, but they fixed it. My barbarian warrior used
to always get stuck on the walls trying to get to his corpse in BB, but now
my human monk can run right thru with no problem.

As a side note, if you still have this problem, look for GAMMA in your Video
card properties and adjust it up. I set mine at 1.2 and have no problem, it
goes MUCH higher. You can find a setting that will fix your night blindness.
*note* this is NOT gamma in EQ this is in your video card properties.
