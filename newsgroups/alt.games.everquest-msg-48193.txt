It's actually a survivable drop.  When you start to Zone, cut your
line and go LD.  When you log back in, the game automatically puts you
on the ground.  Of course, then you'll be standing right beside Master
Yael, and he is *always* in a pissy mood.  You'll be a crispy critter
before you can turn around.
