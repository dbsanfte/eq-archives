Trust me, very soon nuking is going to become a very inefficent way to
kill for you.  Druids don't get any truely decent nukes (Fury of Air
isn't bad, but it's recast time sucks) until 49.  Then you'll be doing
a LOT of quad kiting.

Another thing that you need to realize is that at higher levels,
you're going to be spending the better part of 10 minutes medding up
to full.  Med skill doesn't tend to keep up with your mana pool by
near enough.
