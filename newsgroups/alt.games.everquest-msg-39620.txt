And if the bastards ever fix it so that Drums of the Beast* works with
Selos, I'll outrun sunlight.  I'm actually against horses because I
like being the fastest creature in the game.  Bards may not be the
best at much, but we can run away screaming like a schoolgirl fastest.
Now is horse speed stacked with bard speed, there really aren't zones
big enough to really make it worthwhile.
*Drums of the Beast would be about 10% faster than Selos Drums of the
March but there is a bug where they don't work with Selos songs.  So
you end up carrying a travel drum.
