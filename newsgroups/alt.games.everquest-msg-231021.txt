Yeah the FoB ones are the ones that havent been nerfed; there's another zone
i know of too. Low respawn rate on the spiderlings in FOB i know of in
particular tho, but easy and safe even for race kos to cabilis. I remember
my monk being lent a tailoring kit just so he could get his first ranks of
tailoring ... only later did i learn how much harder crafting is for an
iksar monk than for a wood elf druid, although i was lucky enough to do my
smithing in the days that banded was up to 180+. Practised FD up at the same
time from memory; don't think that you can smith fd now???

I loved falling so i hung over the edge of the pool in cabilis, and fishing
whilst fd. It made no sense whatsoever but it amused the passers by.
