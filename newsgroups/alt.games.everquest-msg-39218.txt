SoW allows you to outrun most mobs even now, and Bards can
motor away from almost anything, but Verant has never felt
the need to make mobs run fast enough to catch *them*, so why
do you think they'd speed up the mobs to be able to catch
horses?

If SoW and bard Selos hasn't unbalanced the game, then neither
will horses.
