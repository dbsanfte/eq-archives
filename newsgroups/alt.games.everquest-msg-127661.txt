Of course, it's a lot more "realistic" and "immersive" to bug the hell out 
of other players via EQ's built-in telepathy. Maybe I'm dumb, but I don't 
see how it's any more immersive to pester players who use spoiler sites than 
to use those spoiler sites yourself.

I don't get the feeling that the OP's complaint was about players who follow 
the quest the way it was meant to be done and gather the information by 
themselves from the relevant NPCs.
