How are you prevented from selling C3? Someone might get upset and
send you a nasty tell? well boo hoo....life has never been so tough.
What you are saying is that competition shouldnt exist because other
sellers already exist.

Try it and find out. Ask the chanter yourself if a price is too high
or too low. You gotta get involved.

What do you mean my not a free market? Does a GM show up when your
chanter friend tries to sell and tells them that they cant because
other chanters are already doing it? I would guess not. If hes so
afraid people might get upset because he is doing the same thing that
they are then he cant handle life very well. Imagine if a plot of land
was for sale on the corner of a busy intersection. Would Exxon refuse
to set up a gas station there because across the street Texaco already
has a station? Hell no....if theres business to be had then go for it.
If demand wanes then go where the demand is. Dont be so sensitive.
