So that you're twice as pointy.

I occasionally play an Enchanter when the giddy thrill of Roguery ebbs.
It's a nice change of pace, and helps you gain an understanding for the
grumpy Enchanters you come across. Which in turn is good for learning
which buttons to push on their considerable egos for favourable buff
treatment. I must say though that even with my Enchanter, I find myself
edging around the back of mobs, eager to plunge my incandescent wand
somewhere unpleasant.

Clerics spend most of their time on their arse, too.
