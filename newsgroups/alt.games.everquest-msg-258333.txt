On the other hand, imagine an EQ without PoK or Bazaar (or remember it
if you were around for it like some of us here). It generally wasn't
worth the effort of selling weapons that low on the food chain in EC
or GFay. Newbies often had to earn what isn't worth the time to camp
nowadays.

In many ways the game was better because of that.
