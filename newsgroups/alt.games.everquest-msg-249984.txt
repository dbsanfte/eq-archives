Those were the 3 most obvious.

Clerics can NOT be replaced by druids, in situations where a cheal chain is
required. If your going to refute me at least do me the courtesy of refuting
what I said.

WTF Mgb heals are you talking about ? There are  no spells that druids get
that Im aware of that are group heals, and if your referring to SoTW, then
Please... Cleric AA group heals are FAR superior to SoTW. Hell.. Paragon(?)
( the Bst Grp heal / Mana regen ) is of far greater worth than Spirit of the
Wood.

Fine Ill give you the PoT9  / Kazaad. I still dont agree though that its
indespenseable.

Once again. Read what I wrote. A smattering of Druids in a Cheal chain will
not make it suffer to much, however a cheal chain made of druids exclusively
is ridiculous on its face.

Pot9, and Protection of the Seasons are hardly what Id call must have
abilities.  And again, if your referring to SoTW as the MGB Heals you keep
on yammering about, then once again see what I wrote above.

Then you need to re-read what I wrote.

And I disagree with this statement. You are welcome to your beliefs, but
you'll not persuade me that they are valid.
