2 things spring to my mind.
Was she a rogue, practicing her hiding or evading during fights? (Can't
remember how see invis reacts to hiding and if it is skill level adjusted)
And, maybe it was lag related, I know I loose sightof  group members
occasionally when I have high packet loss, it is possible that it can also
give the inverse effect, that she had high packetloss and therefore was not
updated by the server to you.
