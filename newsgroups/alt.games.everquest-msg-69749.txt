To my view yes. You can pull to the lake shore near the stream to the FV zone,
and run to zone if you get in over your head. At your level there's a swarm of
blues you can kite.  At around 20 - 22, move to the windmill and solo from
there. I took my 18 Druid to 33 there. Of course I understand that the palce
now is fairly crowded.

Oh. Don't pull those mobs in the ruins by the shore. They will whip your butt.
