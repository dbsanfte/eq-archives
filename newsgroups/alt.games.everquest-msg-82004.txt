Don't get me wrong. SK's can be great, and very useful. I don't think
they suffer much more of a handicap than any other hybrid until you get
to the very top end of the raiding game. BUt as to the tanking thing,
yeah. At 55 warriors get Defensive, and combining that with natural HP,
other stats, equipment available, etc. they pretty much leave everyone
else in the dust as tanks on serious bastard mobs.
