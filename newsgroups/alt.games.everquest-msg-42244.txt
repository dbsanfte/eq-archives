All things being equal, a warrior should use two fast one handers rather than
one
big slow two hander if he wants to get hit, and reverse that plan if for some
reason he wants the mob to concentrate on someone else (say a bigger warrior or
a pet)  Each time you swing a weapon, you add a taunt to that mob, increasing
the chance that it will turn to you or stay on you, instead of going after the
wimpy
ranger, cleric, or wizard in your group who is also actively annoying that mob.

As a cleric, I swore by a big slow two hander... I did as much damage with
it as I would have with a similar ratio faster weapon (unlike warriors, clerics
don't recieve a damage bonus, so comparing ratios is simpler) and I really did
-not- want the mob to taunt off my warrior buddy and onto me.

Your job, nine times out of ten, though, is to get that mobs attention and keep
it.
A fast weapon can do just as much damage a minute as a slow one, hitting for
less but more often, and will help you keep aggro.  Dual weild at your level
won't yeild a lot of extra swings, but try it anyway, as thats the only way that

skill will go up.  As you level up, you'll start getting a damage bonus per
swing,
and that will tilt the odds still further twoards the little fast one handers;
more
swings means more uses of that bonus.

Pets con indifferent, its the faction of their masters that is important, they
are
"only following orders".  If their masters die, they tend to aggro to
everything,
unfortunately unlike -our- pets, which commit suicide when we die!

SOW doesn't help when swimming, it only works while running or flying.  Mobs
are generally level 200 swimmers, without snare you simply won't outswim most
of them... only reason to try is if there's a shoreline near, since many
underwater
mobs won't come out of the water... and even if not, on dry land your SOW
will kick in.  In Lake Rathe (and in many other zones with similar features) the
trick
is to follow the shore line, as if you can get even partially up out of the
water you'll
get the SOW boost.  The Rathe zone lines force you to really swim about half the
time,
even though real walkable land is only about a tenth of the perimeter.
