I'm from europe
I must admit i don't buy every game i play
Anyway i bought everquest
So i installed the game
It load all the differents patch and updates...
And the game seems to start..well oh no i have to make account
i was asking myself why paying a game if i can't play without being
connected over the net...and why paying a game if i have to pay after to
play it...
Anyway i decided to pay for playing twice..
I clicked on New account,and so ?!??
NOTHING !!!
THIS FUCKING SHIT GO NOWHERE
it tell me error 1001 can't connect etc...Blablalbla
THE NEXT TIME I WILL COPY AND LARGELY DISTRIBUTE EVERY GAME FROM VERANT
!!!!

ITS A FUCKING SHIT !!!!!!!!!!!!!
FUCK VERANT !!!!!!!!!!!!
