Yeah!  How dare those jerks make quested spells for levels 44 and 52
that require a group at or near the spell level to go spend some time
XP'ing on level appropriate mobs.  Whatever were they thinking!?  I
know my Druid on Stromm just hated the levels and loot he gained in
LoY zones, pure torture spending hours grouped with friends in zones
where the loot and XP were decent and you had to actually pay attention
to avoid a wipe.  And who the hell was the moron who set it up so you
could get your quest drops while trying to spawn a named mob, WTH kind
of design is that?  And don't even get me started about the melee-only
haste item quest drops those assholes put into the same zone we were
hunting for spell quest drops and priest weapons.  You'd think the
stupid mofos were trying to make the game fun and interesting for group
play or something.
