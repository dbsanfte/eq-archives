From the tone of your (prior) post my inference was entirely reasonable.

What exactly are you disagreeing with?  Your statement "Having an
impressive level doesn't start until 55." is utterly unambiguous in
assigning impressiveness to the level itself.  My response debunked that
particular idiocy.  Your response in turn appears to be a poorly thought
out attempt to retroactively make my argument yours.  This gambit is
popular in politics, but there're no votes being cast here.

The first three sentences of your last paragraph are very well said.  As
to the last, I do not presume that anyone is inferior to me.  I do
however presume that people who belittle others without provocation, as
you have in this thread, deserve to receive even less respect in return.

Could be.  Probably more of an overpopulation problem, Tunare is older
than most and typicly ranks in the top 3 to 5 population-wise during
prime-time.

Touche, I should not have waited until nearly the end of that run-on
sentence to make clear I was stating an opinion.

Only an idiot could disagree, I try to avoid idiocy (with mixed
results).

Um, there still IS a great deal of violent crime in the US.  My hometown
is pretty tame as US metropolitan areas go, and yet every year there are
more than twice as many homicides in the metro area (pop 4,500,000) as
in all of Japan (pop > 110,000,000).  Likewise, I have yet to encounter
or hear of any guild that thinks of itself as "uber" that does not
desreve my characterization.

I have never seen or heard of a single exception, perhaps you can
enlighten me.

Here I make clear that I am stating opinion, yet you cannot resist the
urge to try to belittle my statement.  Once again showing me that you
are either quite young (under 20) or a small-souled twit, perhaps both.

Narrow?  So I did not stray far enough off topic?

Ill-informed?  I've played for nearly two years on several servers, and
read far too many posts on this group and assorted EQ related boards. I
might possibly be less well-informed than you on a few narrow topics,
high-level loot farming exploits for instance, but otherwise I have to
reject that characterization.

Prejudiced? I think not.  My opinions are based on information gathered
from the sources mentioned.

Your combination of arbitrary and unprovoked disrespect to others (the
post I first responded to), occassional well-written and cogent
arguments (when some particular bit of your position is clearly
popular), transparent attempts to change the meaning of your statements
without retracting them, and gratuitous insults wherever they might seem
cute is pretty well typical of an intelligent well-educated youth who
thinks that he must/can win any conflict.  You are excellent
"uber"-guild leader material.  I do hope there is still time for you to
grow up.
