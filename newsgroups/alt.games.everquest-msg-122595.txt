Yes, Brad's horrible Vision brought  us the game we've played for
years.  These other folks are now changing EQ into a game that many of
us wouldn't have played originally and won't play in the future.  The
original folks may have had a plan for the end game days, how to deal
with declining populations and increased competition in the market, but
I rather doubt the things we are seeing now were part of it.  

My biggest question revolves around VI's upcoming releases.  Will this
same attitude of keeping munchkins  happy rather than worrying about
game integrity carry over to the new titles, is it a broad based plan
for the company's future, or simply a method of wringing extra cash out
of old product while making some attempt at keeping new releases as
actual RPGs for a while before trashing them?  

Personally I am lowering my expectations of SWG and EQ2 with each news
release from VI and last night mentioned to friends that if the trend
continues across the industry I may have to go back to my old hobby of
drinking rather than playing games.  My liver is quite concerned!
