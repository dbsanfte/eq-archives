Exploring might just lead you into a dungeon...  While druids are far from
useless/defenseless in a dungeon, they aren't exactly the class I'd pick to
go wandering around a new dungeon solo.

Necromancer would probably be best, closely followed by monk.  Feign death
is such a powerful tool for exploring that no non-fd classes can come close.
