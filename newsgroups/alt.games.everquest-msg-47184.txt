I used to play the Ogre allot, but not so much it was most of my free time.
Took me until about late October there mainly because of being back then
when race (or was it class) based EXP penalties were still around. Also I
was goofing off, and learning more back then too. Taking my time in Living.

The Halfling Druid, well they LV pretty fast, plus due to some other
situations at the time I was able to spend slightly more time.

Iksar SK to LV12, and Barbarian Warrior to I think about 15. Well, lets just
say that the company your company is contracted with for technical support
decides to be stupid (which my company was noted for one of the best, many
awards, but then you pay for what you're getting also, so costly).  Who
cares about customer service or any form of quality.  Getting the customer's
money and taking shortcuts to make more money is what matters right?  "GET
THE HELL OF THE PHONE!!! YOU'RE RUNNING UP MY F***ING AVERAGE CALL TIME!!!"
Fortunately after the AMERICAN ISP handed the contract to a CANADIAN
business and their customers realized the quality of their service now, they
did take some losses.  So back to the story...Iksar SK to LV12 and Barbarian
Warrior to LV15 (at the time)....8 weeks unemployment, playing near 8-12 hrs
a day.

Now that I'm employed again, since mid May (really didn't start up again
till early June, and not more seriously till August) I've went from 15-19.
