No, not automaticly wrong.  Just less informed.  And when two opinions are
in conflict, how else would you choose between the merit of the two?

I mean, give me a break.  You're basing your entire fucking opinion on
accounts of the trials, when I'm the one that was writing the accounts.  And
then claiming you have equal or greater information than me upon which to
base your decision.

Bullshit.  You went way past that with your repeated claim that any guild
can easily get past the trials.  And if they can't, the poster should just
find a "better" guild.

Neither do I.  It's shouldn't be a suprise that people who take positions
based upon ignorance will continue to refuse to listen to anyone more
informed.

Because you say so, heh.

And I say you're not.  Because I say so.   (see, two can play that game.)

Ah, so *now* you're saying that one guild member should be willing to flag
an entire guild, if that is what is required of him for the guild to get
past.   Yet below, you say that no guild should ask for more than half of
your playing time.  (and one wonders exactly how often your guild has
required half of all *your* playing time that you make this proclamation and
think that it is reasonable.)

Hi, the other tanks getting flagged has nothing to do with it.   Drill that
through your thick head.   The next highest warrior was level 60, almost no
AA points, and not raid equipped, over 1200 hp less than me with equal
buffs.  If he suddenly got flagged, he would be a flagged level 60, with
almost no AA points, not raid equipped, over 1200 hp less than me with equal
buffs.  What part of the second one makes him somehow magicly able to get
other people past the trial easier than before?

The next highest warrior after that was 58, and even less equipped than the
first one.   Then 53 or so.

I might recommend you pull your head out of your ass.   This was a family
guild of friends, not an uber or wannabe uber raiding guild.  Recruiting
someone that nobody knew or liked just so we could take advantage of them at
raids is bullshit.  Its as disgusting as the asswipes who only wanted to
join becuase "your guild is strong enough to get me my epic, and my current
one isn't."

Which they have and already had, in spades.

No, you didn't really.  But it made a hell of a lot more sense considering
your other comments.   I see now that you were directly contradicting
yourself (you want guildmembers to show up for every single trial event, yet
have it not take a significant portion of thier playtime.) and withdraw the
arugment.

How many more?  How many rangers do I need to get flagged, before they morph
into a warrior capable of tanking the executioner?   Is there a formula
somewhere that I missed?

Who?  Where will these tanks come from, the level 50 warrior that plays one,
two nights a week tops?   The level 60 who doesn't care for raiding, and
thus will never be nearly as well equipped?

You're contradicting yourself.

Fuck it.  You're not worth responding to the rest of this shit.

Lovely circular argument.  You first proclaim that all it takes is "a good
guild" to make it through.   Then when anyone gives you an example of a
guild that had problems with it (check around, you've been shown several
examples here, and these are hardly isolated incidents.)  you simply
proclaim ... Well, then you must not have been a good guild, since a good
guild would be able to make it through.


I ask again, how many people have you flagged?   You're being one hell of a
hypocrite here, you're telling everyone how much they should be willing to
help out, when you're not even willing to level up to the point where you
are able to help your guildmembers do it.
