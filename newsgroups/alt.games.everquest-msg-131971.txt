Such strange tastes. I'd much rather have the new Accord.  But that's 
probably because I've spent far too much time in life so far fixing my old 
dead clunker that looks -sooo- cool by the side of a road under a 
streetlamp late at night...  And similarly, I think Doom is much cooler 
than Wolfenstein anything.  But that's because I have a stash of levels 
that I made myself for Doom and Doom][ that just -rock-. :)

I dunno about that.  I see new servers, new features, new expansions on 
the horizon... Verant has a -lot- of resources with Sony backing them.  I 
wouldn't be suprised if they can spin more than one plate at a time.

You're assuming something there.  I shall now pull numbers out of my butt.
Say the two that pay off big time are SWG and EQ2.

Current numbers:
       Cost to keep it going     Income 
EQ     $1,000,000                $3,000,000

Numbers after SWG and EQ2 come out:

EQ     $1,200,000                $2,200,000
SWG    $1,500,000                $5,000,000
EQ2    $1,500,000                $4,000,000

(Again, let me emphasize, these numbers were entirely anally extracted.)

So what you're saying here is, since they're making $6mil on the other two 
games, so they're just going to throw away the million dollars they make 
off EQ?  Assumptions I'm making:  SWG and EQ2 wil cost more to run because 
they use newer technologies.  EQ will get more expensive to run because 
they (a) adapt some new technologies and (b) inflation.  The release of 
the new games (and other companies' new games) will impact EQ's player 
base.

We've all seen it, even with the server numbers hidden.  DAoC or AO comes 
out, and the population in ec decreases for a bit, then crawls back up to 
nearly where it was.  Sure, they have an impact, they steal some players 
from EQ, but in the longer term, this is either made up for by new EQ 
payers joining us, or traitors coming back with their tail between their 
legs. :)

Sure, eventually, EQ will not be profitable, and will not bring enough 
more income than it costs to run to make it worthwhile.  But that's 
probably going to be well past the Next Big New Thing.

Oh hey look!  There's a whole nother side to the street over there!  That 
one where making players happy makes Verant money...
