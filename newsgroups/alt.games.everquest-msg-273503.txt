I never made the run from Freeport to Qeynos until recently.  I was quite simply too
*frightened*.

I recall getting some social aggro as I was XPing in the northwest corner of the West
Commonlands.  I drove my train to the Kith zone.  When I saw the words "Kithicor Forest"
on my screen, I froze in fear, praying that my train in WC would wander off, and I could
zone back, before something came running out of the nasty dark forest to eat me.
