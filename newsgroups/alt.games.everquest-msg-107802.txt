I've been playing recently on Tallon Zek in the Lake of Ill Omen.  From what I've
seen, the zone is sparsely populated.  It's not nearly as busy as on a blue (non PvP) server.
However, I still got one shorty PK'er attempt to kill my party.   Three
against one.  he was dead inside a minute.  Got a fair amount of loot off of him... about
30pp  (not bad for my level).

To top it off, he came, looted his corpse then attacked us again.  Dead again
inside a minute.

One of the tricks to surviving on a PvP server is to stay in a group.  Safety in numbers,
etc. etc.  Failing that, if you have hide or invis, use that when medding.  I don't know
how many times I was attacked while medding when I first started playing EQ on
TZ (my first character was a wood elf druid there!  shorty bait :P)

If it's a rogue attacking you, back up to a wall or tree so that he can't get
behind you and use backstab which causes double or triple damage.
