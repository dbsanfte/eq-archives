awful could mean they are not pulling their weight... AFK without
telling anyone for long periods of time.

A ninja looter who has split off could do similar actions... you have
no idea they are looting unless they loot an item. or you are watching
em... Usually in a exp group i'm too busy pulling or healing to notice
the abusive looter.

Yes you are absolutely correct here.  They "could" do that.

Exactly... you would never know... so what's the beef? 
I will go ahead and "let them prove themselves", and I have been
burned by this in the past, but I also have been rewarded by meeting
some superior Rogue Players.

Please don't feel I'm saying your wrong... I was just putting my
perspective on the "Ill never group with a rogue unless I already know
them"  (how did you get to know those rogues?)

good hunting... and may you find many rogues who do you well.
