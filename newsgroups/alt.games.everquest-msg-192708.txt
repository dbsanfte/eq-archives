How about... "At least one, if not more (and, very probably, many more),
fool (not to be confused with Court Jesters which were at one time referred

"The Ten Commandments contain 297 words. The Bill of Rights is stated in 463
words. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address contains 266 words. A recent federal
directive to regulate the price of cabbage contains 26,911 words."
