I soloed my cleric a bit, level 51 now.  You still have to stun stuff
a lot.  Stune back off, root, nuke. Remember to use to lowest level
root you have, since its most likely going to get broken as soon as
nuke lands.  Faster cast time too.

I only soloed from 44 to 48, could only play a few hours a week, so
figured would maximize it by killing a static spawn whenever could.
One in highkeep was still green but giving xp when I left. Was kos to
banker too haha Took while to fix that.

Bottom line is, get used to medding and healing, going to be doing a
lot of it.  If not your bag, then stop playing cleric now, the game
for cleric is mana management.
