Hmm, not sure.  They're a cheap mb manufacturer, they do tons of OEM 
stuff.  The board I was trying to use is their first real stab at the 
high-end market.  It's a very basic board, but it was rated highly.  I 
just happened to get two DOAs CPUs (as tested by the shop that eventually 
sold me a working CPU/MB combo).
