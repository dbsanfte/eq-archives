umm.. I'm pretty sure this was leaked by either the developer that
hangs out at the Safehouse, or one of Abashi/Absor's post on the EQ
board.  If it was on the EQ board, you could probably search EQ Vault
or Caster's Realm and have it come up.

To be a little more precise, it's not that a 100 stamina will make the
stamina bar meaningless, it just basically makes it so that your
weapon speed won't degrade when your staimina bar goes down to nil.
You'll still be encumbered if you try to walk, and still be limited in
the number of jumps you can take.
