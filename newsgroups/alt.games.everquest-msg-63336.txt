On the 6th shawl myself.
There are actually profit to be made, both from baking and pottery.
Lots of people only do the first 3 shawl quests, and then they need a 
pie tin and a pot. I have earned a few 100pp in thurg by making them on 
request.
And for baking, i made around 100pp on selling dwarf chops for 5pp a 
stack (killed dwarfs for 9 levels, had LOTS of meat), and i had a guy 
offer me 100pp for a stack of frost giant steaks (only need 4 meat if 
made with CS ingredients). And fish rolls for 5pp is usually a big hit too.
