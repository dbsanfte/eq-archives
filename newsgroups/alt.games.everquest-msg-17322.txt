All the classes are fairly balanced and are equally fun to play. Your choice
entirely is down to preference on how you like to play and which class
appeals to you the most. I would say that you are wanting to be a magic user
like myself.

Finding spells is all part of playing the casters, as you get to higher
levels you will have much more difficulty finding the spells you need and
some you may have to make yourself. Spellfinding is part of the fun of the
class. At the highest levels you must complete huge quests just to be albe
to get a single spell.

As to your preference of caster, its down to you. I am a wizard. They are
quite hard to play as they are group dependant. Maybe you prefer soloing in
which case a druid is for you. If you want to be welcomed by any group then
an enchanter is for you.

Alot of spells will require components to cast, thats just a nessecity.

Just remember one thing:
Its not how you pick your charachter, its how you play it.
