Correct.  Basically, a pixel on a CRT emits light when it is hit by the
electon beam scan, and then fades out.  If a pixel is supposed to be on, it
gets hit on each scan of the beam.  When the software decides to turn a
particular pixel off, the CRT simply stops hitting it with the beam, and it
fades away.

By using a high scan rate, combined with phosphors that fade out rapidly,
you get a flicker-free image, with no ghosting.  If the refresh late gets
too low, however, you get flicker, because the on pixels have a chance to
fade out between updates.

An active-matrix LCD (which is what all the LCD monitors for desktop systems
use) has pixels that keep their state.  When a pixel is turned on, it stays
on.  When a pixel is turned off, it stays off.  This is why there is no
flicker on an LCD display.

The time to change state for an LCD pixel can be as low as 20ms on the
fastest displays, to as high as 50-60ms for the slower displays.  20ms
should be OK for gaming.  60ms would suck.
