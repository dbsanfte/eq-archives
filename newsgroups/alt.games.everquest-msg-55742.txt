I don't disagree with that.

Ironic, isn't it, that the GM events turn out to be among the *worst*
times for role-playing? This game would be great if it weren't for the
other players :)

Frankly, I'm not sure how Verant could promote role-playing without
active participation, which is obviously impossible on a on-going
basis.

>In game I have met very few people that actually role-play.

Nor have I, but I've often found that when *I* role-play, others
around me are more likely to as well.
