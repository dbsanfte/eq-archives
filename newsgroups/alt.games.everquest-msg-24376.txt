Since I have practically all, I can give a fairly accurate account of these.

Raymond E. Feist has been busy, writing alot of books.
The one mentioned first below is the Riftwar Saga.
Which includes the books mentioned. Although the two Magician Books can now
be found conbined into one, with some adds from the author.

Prince of the Blood, and The Kings Buccaneer are two works that builds
independently on the story begun in the Riftwar Saga.

After them in chronology (storywise) comes the Riftwar Legacy Saga, which
begins with Krondor: The Betrayal. After that one comes Krondor: The
Assasins and then finally Krondor: Tear of the Gods.

To finish of the storyline comes the Serpentwar Saga. Four books.
Shadow of a Dark Queen
Rise of a Merchant Prince
Rage of a Demon King
Shards of a Broken Crown

All these follow esentially the same characters, on the same world.

Then there is also the Empire Saga, which Feist wrote together with Janny
Wurtz. It consists of the three books, Daughter, Servant and Mistress of the
Empire. This trilogy is largely independent from the other books, but there
are things that combine them all. It's practically a paralell story to the
Riftwar Saga, in time.

Enjoy
