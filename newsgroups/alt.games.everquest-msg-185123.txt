*eyeroll* You're still grasping at that one, aren't you...? Okay, I
just re-read the entire post in the link. I don't see where you're
getting that quote. Here, maybe someone else is taking whatever you
are and having the same hallucinations so they can point it out to me:

"Undeniably illiterate", huh? I'm not the one reading things in a post
that aren't there. Now, if you mean to say that quote is from
elsewhere, I need two things: A link, and an explaination of how I can
be "undeniably illiterate" for not reading something that wasn't in
the post linked to...
