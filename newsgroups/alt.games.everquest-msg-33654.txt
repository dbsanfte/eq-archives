Having never seen one, I assumed it was an Axe.  Once it was pointed out to
me that it was a sword, I looked at the word again ( to make sure I wasn't
just adding or subtracing letters ) and your pronunciation it the one that I
saw it as.  When my co-worker gets out of a meeting, I'm going go have him
call hiswife and ask her, since she is from France.
