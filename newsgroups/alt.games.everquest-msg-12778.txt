Yes, there's that as well.  Nobody bothers my Dark Elf Magician on
Bristlebain much.  I think it's partly because I'm only level 36, and
therefore not obviously "uber" enough to have "phat lewt" lying around. 
And it's also because when I'm travelling, I generally wear sub-standard
equipment just for the look.  (I often wear the Robe of the Elements and
wield a Staff of Writhing when I'm just wandering around or pounding greens
for faction.)
