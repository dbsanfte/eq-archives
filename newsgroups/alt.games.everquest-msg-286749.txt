Take out "large" and I don't see the difference.  I will agree that 60
people are harder to coordinate than 25.

Twitch is very "learnable".  It's quick thinking mixed with hand-eye
coordination.  Both are skills that can be developed.  I don't really
see that knowledge is that related to difficulty.  Is your Googling
ability part of your EQ "skill"?

Anyway.  The issue isn't really whether EQ is more or less difficult
than WoW.  The issue, for me, is just to not make boneheaded
statements like "People w/o brains don't play EQ."
