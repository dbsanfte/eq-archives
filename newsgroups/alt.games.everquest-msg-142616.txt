JBoots are the KEY to cleric soloing.  Nukes are indeed slow casting, but
Root or Immobilize is not.  Run out to max root range.  Root.  Run out to
max nuke range.  Nuke till root breaks, repeat.  If you aren't faster than
the mobs, you -can- still do this by channeling root... but you'll find you
spend too much mana healing yourself.  Or you can use Flash of Light
and root tactics, but this now introduces yet another possible resist, its
functional but "busy"... T/Jboots or SOW make it unnecessary.

I solo because I have RL activities that can be interrupted for occaisional
killing.  Kill mob, sit somewhere safe to med back to full While doing
RL activity, repeat.  With a partner, I'd be constantly busy, so no RL
activity would take place.  IF I had to sit at the keyboard the whole time
waiting for the mana to med back, this would indeed be an insane waste
of my time... beat out only by the waste of time a warrior would spend
sitting till he got full health.

Cleric soloing as I suggest has the same down time as a manastone
one... which is to say none.  Why?  Because every time I take a break
from RL, I'm FM and ready to go.  I'm thinking of faithstoning to
Kaladim from now on to med, though, since the cost of Gating
back isn't a serious one, I can bind closer to my kill spot or heck,
even out in the middle of the Pulling grounds if I like, now that I
have Run 2 so I don't have to worry about being stuck next to a
mob with TBoots off.
