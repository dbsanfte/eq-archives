Aha, I have a different trick for you to try; slap a DS (clicky) on him 
instead.  He'll die plenty fast enough, but this way all the mobs 
hitting him are taking DS damage the whole while, so when you start on 
the next one its already down to 90%, and the next one after that is 
already down to 80%... 9 points adds up after a while when its unslowed 
mobs tearing away at a target.

Then I chant away at my pet's principle target (assist pet to find this 
one) so it dies earlier too, and since my charmed pet that was doing 
much of the damage is by then already invised out and maybe even dead, I 
don't take the charmed pet penalty.  This means that I'm killing at 
normal chant killing rate on top of swarm killing rate.

Oh, and I have a solstice earring, which is sufficient mana regen to 
pretty much eliminate ever having to sit down.

Primarily right where you are, POD flies.  Started low with 3 or 4, then 
worked my way up with increasing confidence and levels to 8 or 9 at a 
time, rats and larvae welcome to join the party; at that point I was 
literally going around and getting more when the swarm started to thin 
out.  Worst thing about POD is that the rats have something funny they 
do when low on HP, if nothing is actively hurting them they mysteriously 
self heal to 40% hp (no spell, no gradual regen, just poof, 40% again). 
  This means that One rat is bad news, but Two rats is a party, since 
they don't run unless they are alone.  I kept Lev (SS boots) and Tboots 
(yep,  too lazy to get JBoots) up constantly since terrain is a bitch 
and water worse, and Selos is a pain due to its short duration and the 
fact that its waaaaay too fast for the mobs to follow me reliably.  What 
else.  Oh, Chains; get a new pet and sometimes it takes him quite a 
while to convince his target to stop following me around and settle down 
to fight, this means the damage the swarm is doing is a lot lower 
because they keep having trouble getting in position to attack.  Snare 
the designated target and outrun the pack, with longer range they'll all 
turn on the pet as the only thing they can get to, then I can circle 
back to help out.  Further in the flies get higher level, so as you 
start cleaning them out faster there's always more, I don't recall ever 
running out.

I also did PON, playing with the ravens, trees, and spiders, but they 
can be a lot trickier to round up in quantity.

And Lightcrawlers and bugs in POD are good fun, but since some of the 
bugs HT this can be pretty scary stuff, I don't think I got to the point 
where I was swarming them so much as one on one charm killing... and 
grouping at that camp was better exp than soloing there.

Lets see, I also had a lot of fun in Skyshrine, but can't say the exp 
was all that good.
