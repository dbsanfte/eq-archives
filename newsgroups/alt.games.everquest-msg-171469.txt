    It's also a function of choice of zone. Consider the standard places
that 30's chanter will head, Frontier Mountains, Dawnshroud, and The
Overthere:

-single pulling is trivial, there's room for root-parking
-slowing isn't required on most XP mobs, especially not if the healer has
KEI
-Tash isn't required on most XP mobs, unless you want to fear kite (and most
people hate running around because they might get adds)
-people don't add in the DPS increase from haste and just see a substandard
nuker and damage dealer when they figure out how much DPS an ENC adds.
Alacrity adds a whopping 40% speed increase, but on people that all likely
have a FBSS from The Bazaar that means you need to have at least three tanks
doing nothing but melee damage for the enchanter to be dealing as much
damage as another melee. If there's a shaman in the group for Quickness,
that marginal DPS increase is crap.
-most other enchanter utility spells are nothing more than cheap tricks,
available on items anyways, or are non-combat related

    Were these same characters actually in a >gasp< dungeon, this would
change.

    In any game where there's so much to know even about one's own class,
it's not surprising that people might not know about others and will cling
to generalizations. I bet you don't even know as much as you think you do.
For example, consider the following open question I had to answer recently:

    Mob X quads for 2000 damage, and Rampages - rampage frequency is neither
high nor low once debuffed. It also casts an AoE DoT that is extremely
difficult to resist, and has a fairly high melee range. The raid does not
have the resources to run healing on two main tanks at the same time (why
would healing have to be this high?) There are mobs with 20 K HPs in the
area that can be charmed (not Dire Charmed) and used in the fight, which put
out close to 300 DPS unhasted. Would you use the charmed mobs as rampage
tanks? Why or why not? If your answer is yes, how do you do it?

    Remember, no partial credit! (And Ben - recognize this scenario?)
