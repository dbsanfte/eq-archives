One thing it is good for is seeing what you're doing while setting it
up. Turn forcedraw on and adjust x/y until you have them where and as
big as you want, then turn it off. It's rather hard to do that when
you can't see the windows. Personally, I wish they'd just made them
drag/resizeable like the chat windows somehow.
