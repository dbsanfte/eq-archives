I haven't had any problems on my Win2k machine, but I had three
crashes last night on my XP notebook while doing nothing more
strenuous than playing trader in the bazaar, staring at the floor. I
haven't checked the log yet to see if there's any indication of what
the problem is.

After each of those three crashes (which took me to the EQ logon
screen), I did not reboot the computer or restart the game. I just
logged back in. Finally, the machine ran all night without a hitch
(except that nobody bought the stuff I was trying to pawn off).
