   I don't like TLC, but I don't think it was the stupidest,
most inane thing they've ever done.  It was a good hearted
attempt to fix something that many people find annoying,
pharming.  Of the top of my head, I cant think of a way 
to put an end to it, but I have to give credit to Verant 
for at least taking a stab at it.  

Annie  <--- Thinks that refusing to put in a Mana Bar is
            MUCH more stupid and inane.
