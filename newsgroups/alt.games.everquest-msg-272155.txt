I thought it sounded like they will be charging for additional content
on top of the free stuff.  In a big update, they give you the populated
zone, but if you pay a fee they populate it with 'more' quests.  Isn't
that sort of what happened on the Legends server - pay more for more
content?

I think the only problem would be if they cut down the normal content
they provide for free and charge you to get it.  If they keep the free
content around the same amount per update but charge for a large
increase over it, I don't see a problem.  Yesterday's patch gave us two
new dungeons and opened up Lavastorm.  If they throw in more stuff than
a normally populated zone, it would depend on the zone (levels, if I am
not going to see it why would I pay for it?), the amount of content,
and the fee before I determined whether or not to purchase it.

I'm guessing it will be a pretty small fee, kind of like the $2.00 (or
whatever it is) to use all the eq2players.com features.  As long as it
isn't mandatory, I don't think it will be a problem.  It will be
interesting to read the real press release from SOE next week,
hopefully they will expand on this quite a bit.
