btw this is how I first managed to get into the game last night.

8 hours after I first tried (i tried, tried, tried, went and slept.. then
tried afterwards) I FINALLY got the eqgame.exe, the dll file and some other
stuff.  It was predicting 5+ hours for the download though (im on cable),
and stalling a lot...

Somebody posted a link on the messageboards to a set of the patcher files,
and not needing any of "his" executables, I had no qualms Dling the rest of
the docs and images from his site (I don't even have word installed so macro
virus wouldnt be an issue)

Tried with my second comp for a few hours to DL the patch, finally at
12:30am EST it started to patch (still very slow and stalling), by 1am I had
both comps patching and estimating 2hours left... so left it running and
went to work.

Hopefully it will all be DL'd when I get home today
