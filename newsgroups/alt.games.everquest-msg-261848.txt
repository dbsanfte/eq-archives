You're argument demonstrates nicely a major logical fallacy.  I
did not refer to thepercentage differences in the skill numbers.
I spoke of the difference in damage done.  Here're a few clues
that might help you to understand the difference...

Clue #1:  The percentage difference in the caps is NOT identical to
the percentage difference in the hit rate or in the average hit.
Clue #2:  It's a douple penalty, Knight Weapon skill caps AND Offense
skill cap are BOTH lower.
Clue #3:  We do not have access to EQ's combat resolution formulas,
therefore skill numbers give us only a hint as to the difference
in effectiveness in actual play.  Extensive log parsing, preferably
of controlled tests, is required to establish in-game effects.
Parsing of highend Warriors/Knights has consistently shown Warriors
exceeding Knights by 20% to 25% in straight melee damage with 2H
weapons (the higher figure applies when using identical weapons, the
lower when Knights use slightly better Knight-only 2handers).
Clue #4:  In these tests the characters all have their stats maxxed,
at my level of play Warriors typically have substantially higher
strength, which translates into higher damage.
Clue #5:  Clueful Rangers outdamage Warriors.  CLueful Rangers also
increase their entire group's melee damage output in ways that are
unavailable to Warriors and Knights.
Clue #6:  Clueful groups of post-50 players do not imagine their
tanks to be "nearly" the best DPS available.

There're more of them than you might think.  Not to mention
L58 Rangers with Onyz Earrings (+2 AGI) and etc.

Pretty damned loose definition of nearly.  And as for grouping
all dual wielders together, it'd be an amazingly piss-poor
Rogue or Monk who couldn't leave a Warrior or Bard choking on
his dust damage-wise.


Kaev 59 Paladin
Firjak 51 Druid
Djeef 43 Paladin
Medra 38 Druid
Starkle 32 Ranger twink
& etc.
