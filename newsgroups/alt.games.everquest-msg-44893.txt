Wouldn't want bad info spreading around, so I'll be blunt.  This info is
just *wrong* :)
The secondary hand is in no way shape or form tied to what's in your primary
hand.  The two hands work completely seperate.  Your first hand swings
according to the weapon delay in that hand.  The secondary hand swings
according to its delay, with one catch.  Each time a secondary hand swing
comes up, a dual wield check is made.  If successful, you swing.  If not,
nothing happens.  Put a weapon with a delay of 40 in primary, and a weapon
with a delay of 20 in secondary, and the secondary (assuming all dual wield
checks succeed) will swing two times for every time the primary goes off.
Notice the dual wield check comes up at a delay of 20 (cause it's tied to
the secondary), not 40.   There's a good explanation of this on
www.monkly-business.com.
