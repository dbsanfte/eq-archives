/sigh
If they have munged up that quest so badly that a L1 can complete it
solo you have a small point, but very small.  In the time that L1
Paladin does this the Ranger can level to 5, collect Spiderling Silks,
sell the Silks and buy a BABS.  Tell me who made better use of their
time now, the L1 Paladin with a 18/40 2-hander that will exhaust him
(and untwinked baby Paladins who are not Dwarves generally do not
have a 100 STA), or the L5 Ranger with a lightweight 24/39 2-hander?

Your entire argument is absurd.  You are comparing quests from very
early in the game's history that are totally irrelevant to any
knowledgeable player.  Even on Stromm you saw very few Deepwater
Harpoons, better weapons were available cheaply very soon after
server opening.
