One thing to note about the TM camp... DO NOT KILL ALL THE SKELETON
SLAVES!!!!  Leave 1 up and never touch it.  If you clear the whole room, it
will eventually spawn a thought horror, which spams some emotes and then
summons a high level enchanter mob named Xilniov.  This mob will charm you
and eventually kill you, after killing any other players in the zone with
you. Makes for some nasty tells.  A great camp though, especially if you're
also clearing the lower room with the live mobs.  Took a necro from 47 to 50
there in 2 nights awhile back.
