I'm going to assume you mean the shuttles for the boat in TD (to go
from BBM to FV).  And I too rode a lot of boats, but the ride to/from
FV was so stupidly long that I only made that trip when I was changing
hunting grounds.  That's why my old Warrior alt got so good at dodging
drachnids, it was gonna take a lot more than an occasional exciting CR
to get me to spend 2 to 3 hours travelling to get anywhere.  At least
in LOIO I could solo or group as it pleased me and always be able to
be doing something.  It's harder now (social cats), but a Warrior with
very unimpressive equipment (BABS + Crafted, lots of bandages) can solo
all the way to 32 in LOIO if so inclined.
