High-hold pass is excellent training for a cleric. Since adds and multiple
pulls are inevitable you really get to see heal agro in action. One heal on
the tank and you watch all but one mob come to pay you a visit. Likewise
watching mobs come out of mez and bee-line for you makes you realize that
mezzed mobs are still building agro. I'd estimate that, other than a bard,
i'm most likely to get spell agro... simply because melee HP aren't that
high (thank god for twinks) and my heal, being weak, needs to be cast fairly
frequently.

It's just a shame that the best chance for a low agro-heal isn't available
till level 19 :(
