Hill giants are level 33 to 37 with lots of hit points; sand giants are
similar. I soloed my first sand giant (without LOH) at 43 last night.
First, they don't have any spells. Second, don't bother using stun on
them. Third, you will have to root, back up and heal. I had to heal 4
times before I could finish it off. I ended up at 20 percent health and
10 percent mana. What I don't know is if I killed a level 33 or 37 or
somewhere in between.

Make sure you have Daring and your symbol up of course and that you are
at full health and mana. Also, I used an ACG and FBSS, so you may have
problems with lesser equipment.
