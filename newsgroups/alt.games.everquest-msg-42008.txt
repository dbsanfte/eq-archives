Rogues are not meant to take damage. That's why they stand behind the
mob. They are a melee class simply because they rely on their physical
ability to knock the stuffing out of their opponent, instead of mystical
or magical means like spells.

A good rogue who knows how to evade keeps aggro *off*, and the backsides
turned to oneself. It is not like feign death where the mob aggro list
is hopefully cleared while the FDer lays still. It is more a temporary
turn off of auto-attack while combat continues. Evade gets used LOTS
during combat.
