It works during combat, but I'm not sure it works on mezed mobs.

I tested it out last night, and even after taunting repeatedly, the mezed
mob was still focused on the enchanter or the druid.   Most of the time when
I broke mez, it stayed on me.... even though /assist never showed it leaving
the enchanter until mez was broken.  (Not even once, of the several times
that I checked it.)
