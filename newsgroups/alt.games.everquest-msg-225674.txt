Get a good friend in the US or canada. Give them your log into and have them get and actiate LDoN on their machine.
Zip/Rar (compression software of choice.) the EQ directory and FTP.e-mail wtf ever you can do it to your machine and 
unpack it in your directory. I have reinstalled windows a few times the game seems to run under default stuff on mine 
so you can run even my copy on your machine. Just have to have the files downloaded and LDoN active on your account to work.
