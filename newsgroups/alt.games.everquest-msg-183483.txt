    Well, what about not so high levels with no AA? Like 39-40?

    Well it does sound like no class is underpowered post 60, but I don't
think I ever made the assertion or implication that anybody was.

    I still think they should've fixed the pathing issues not blanketly
banned fear in the zone as they apparently have done. If fear kiting turns
out to be not viable after the exploit's gone people will stop trying on
their own.
