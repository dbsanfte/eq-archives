It's fairly easily resisted, but with camp can jump upwards to 390 or so
worth of damage (over 600 with puretone).

Most folks I know that use it will use it for something extra on long Kites
or as something of a finishing blow. The "looooooong" span of time is 5
minutes (that's the reset on it). So, imagine you are kiting ice burrowers
in WW (level 61 mob), you can twist it in once each time that it pops up and
take that extra 220- almost 400 plus damage or so and then continue on with
your normal twist.
