Hey, when I'm tired, I can leave out entire chaptors of explanations
without intending to. I presently do computer tech support, only
other employees call me. ... Every once in a while I have to explain
electricity to one of them. I have certain things to do, like
backups, but the rest of the 12 hour shift I sit there waiting for
the phone to ring. Its tiring.
