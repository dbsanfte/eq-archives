So, this is what it all comes down to.  Ed Jensen said what everyone else
wanted to say.  It's not about science, if it was, it would have ended at "I
don't know."  It's about a bunch of petty kids whining because the universe
isn't exactly like they want.  You've used pseudo-logic, sophistry, and
scemantics to try to prove your point, completely ignoring the fact that you
have no firm foundation.  I've seen "proof by assertion" thrown around like
it was fact.  And, finally, someone states what it's all about.

Oh, and Ed Jensen, you can kiss my ass.  If you don't like my God, that's
your problem  If you're too petty to try to find the truth, and instead
insist on clinging to your pseudo-scientific views, it's not my problem.
I've tried to discuss things rationally.  It seems I was the only one
interested in that.  Fine, I don't give a rat's ass.  Reply if you want, it
doesn't matter.  I'm dumping the entire damn thread.

Oh, and Lokari.... I expected better than cheap shots from the sidelines
from you.
