Short answer - being the lowest level in a high level group will
get you the most XP/hour

Long answer:

Where

PL = Player level (yours in this case)
NP = Number of players in party
SL = Sum of player levels

Then your xp cut is

(PL+5)/(SL+(NP*5))

So, if you're 40 - case 1 is
PL = 40, NP = 6, SL = (5*35)+40 = 215
45/245 = 18.4%

Case 2 is
PL = 40, NP = 6, SL = (5*45)+40 = 265
45/295 = 15.25%

So, you get a higher percentage if you're the
top person.  However, remember that the base xp
given by a mob goes up as mob level squared.

Where
ML = Mob level
GB = Group Bonus
  (1.2 for 2, 1.4 for 3, 1.6 for 4, 1.8 for 5, 2.16 for 6)
HCB = High Con Bonus
  (If PL<50 OR ML<55 OR ML<(PL-5)) HCB = 1
  Else HCB = 1.95 + (.13 * (ML-(PL-5))
ZEM = Zone Experience Modifier
  A whole number that varies by zone, common ones are
  PC=160, PoP=119, The Hole=100, AC=90

Base XP = ML*ML*GB*ZEM*HCB

So, a group of 35's with one 40 (you) hunting level
30 mobs in a zone with a ZEM of 75 (Most lower level
outdoor zones) have a base xp per mob of -
30*30*2.16*75*1 = 145,800  of which you get 26,827

The group of 45's will likely be hunting mobs at least
level 35 (lowest level that's DB) so they'll be getting
35*35*2.16*75*1 = 198,450 per mob, of which you get 30,263

So, even though your percentage share is bigger when you're
the high level in the group, your actual XP per mob is likely
lower than it will be as the lowest member of a higher level
group.

BTW - 30 is the lowest DB to a 40, 35 is the lowest DB
to a 35 - barring odd rounding.
