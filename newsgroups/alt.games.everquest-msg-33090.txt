I was really thinking of the asshole newbs (anybody remember Fansy the
bard?), not twinks, because personally, I don't mind twinking, unless the
person is being an ass about it, like a level 6 monk in North Ro claiming a
derv camp when all he did was stand there in his fungi tunic with an imbued
fighters staff and say "I'm camping here, you can't kill them, my friend is
coming to PL me", and wave a pair of mith leggings in my face "I'll give you
these if you leave"

To make a long story short, 10 minutes later I started a group there, he got
pissy, and a passing by level 44 druid laughed him out for claiming a fully
spawned camp and not killing anything.

I made a level that day, 3 weeks later, saw 3 people in EC /oocing "don't
deal with <ass twink monk>, he's cheating people", he was anonymous so I
don't know what level he is, but in the 4 times i've /who all'd his name
since, he's not been on.

errmm... /rant off..... Level 6 in fungi tunic is just wrong....
