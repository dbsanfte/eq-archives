Back to the xp stuff I've posted here before

HCB = High Con Bonus

IF Mob Level < 55 OR
   Player Level < 50 OR
   Player Level - Mob Level > 5 

THEN HCB = 1

ELSE HCB = 1.95 + ((Mob Level - (Player Level - 5)) * .13)

So, you still have to hunt reds to get a HCB

.75 * 52 = 39.  Some of the mobs up top in the revamped Hole
are 38, so cyan.  Otherwise it is exactly what you described -
barely DB in a zone with a high ZEM.  However they are easy
kills and it sounds like you were running out.

For that reason I took my kitty elsewhere at 51.

Why isn't PoI great XP?  Becasue entry mobs are low 50's - high 40's
(no HCB) and the ZEM is only 19% higher than the Hole while
they hit 2-3 times harder.   

LDoN seems to have a decent ZEM combined with mobs that are easier
for their level than PoP. 

The average mob in a 65/normal adventure hits for 370 and has
around 15k HP  - yet about half of the summoned type mobs in 
Takish can't be mage mezzed - making them >60th.  The comparable
mobs in PoV hit for 550 and have 20k HP.

ME has always sucked for XP.  I've never understood the attraction
of that place.  Worse, I need that lucid shard <sigh>
