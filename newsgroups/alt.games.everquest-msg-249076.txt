Sounds vaguely like the /harvest command from SWG, a class skill for

You can get tradeskill successes on failures.  And I don't know, I find
tradeskilling in FFXI (which has a fractional point system) exceedingly

Oh in FF you can't get a skillup without a success, maybe that has some
effect on me.
