I have to say that that simply does not hold with my experience on my 24
ranger. The groups I have been with ranged from dire to well drilled
killing machine with the whole of sarnak fort to pick and choose from...

I have never out stripped my solo levelling in a group though I have
levelled just as fast in a well oiled group with no limits on prey and a
good selection of classes. I group to obtain higher level loot and for
sociability, not for xp grinding.

This may change dramatically as I level up, but then quoting high level
playability for low level use is picking uber standards and applying them
inaapropriately.
