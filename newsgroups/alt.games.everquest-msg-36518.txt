Hehe, i quite agree on that one. I started my 4th char, an iksar monk, and the
Iksar newbie area is the most peaceful area, no beggers, no idiots shouting at
each other, almost no KSing, and if it should happen there are plenty of mobs.
Iksars starting place Field of Bone and Kurns Tower are at the moment some of my
favorite zones in the game.

Hehe, unless you die that is. One of my friend play it, and even had to call me
to bitch over it.
In EQ when you die, you loose a little XP, respawn at bind area, have to get on a
corpse run to get your stuff back. Can be tough if its a long run, or in a bad
place, but you can live with it.

In AO you have some insurance terminals you use to save your game. Lets say you
save your game, then run around 10 min away from the nearest terminal, find a
great group, kill stuff for 4 hours, then die.
Then you respawn at the terminal with all the stuff you had WHEN you used it.
That means that all loot and money is lost, and even more important, all XP you
got those 4 hours is lost. My friend died 2 times and because of that ended up
with having played for 6 hours with NOTHING gained from it, not a single XP
point.
