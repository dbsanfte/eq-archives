Most yes... but that's more a philisophical point than an capabilities 
point. If they're long-term in a family guild that never organizes 
beyond 'bottom feeding expansions' then its because they do not *want* 
to do anything that requires more organization.

Some family guilds... well maybe not 'family', 'by definition'... but 
many guilds that are not archetypical 'raid guilds' can do luclin stuff.

Many things don't have a Master/Slave relationship to them... the point 
was its common knowledge that an organization led by dictatorship is 
more effective at 'doing things' than a collective form of government. 
(In RL being more effective at doing things is not always an 
advantage... after all...genocide is 'doing something'...)

So naturally guilds run like monarchies are 'first' to do things. The 
leader says heel... and his legion of lifeless peons gather at his feet 
to do his bidding. Its far more effective than ... 'lets see who's 
online on monday... and if we can get enough people on maybe we'll take 
a vote on if/where to raid...'.
