Whatever the problem was, it seemed to affect only the login server and
not the actual world servers. We were in the middle of a long AC camp
and several guildies chimed in late in the evening of having either gone
LD or just logging in late, and taking anywhere from 25 minutes to 90
minutes to log in.
  However, if you got in early it seems that things were running
smoothly. We never lost connection and the game was running fine.
