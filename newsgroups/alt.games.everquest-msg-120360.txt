Exactly. You're a team. Your triumphs are your teams triumphs. YOur
fuckups are your teams fuckups. Bullshit it "teaches the innocent
nothing". It teaches the innocent that they are responsible for
policing their team, the team acts as a whole, and the team is
responsible for each other. It also teaches the "innocent" to try to
deal with problem members within themselves before running to the
authorities to take care of a problem that could have been easily
taken care of without their intervention.
