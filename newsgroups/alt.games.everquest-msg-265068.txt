Basically had the same thing happen to me last night.  A Trooper Skelly 
conned blue to my Enchanter but before I could get off a spell I was feared 
and dotted.  My lvl 20 pet did some damage to it but I was being fear kited 
by 4 greens and never made it back to help my pet.  Needless to say I was 
able to find my corpse when the sun came up.
I camped in the cave so I am ready to give it another try tonight.
