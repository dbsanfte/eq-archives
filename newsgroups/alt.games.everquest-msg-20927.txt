Othmir live on the beach in Cobalt Scar.  Few people hunt them,
as they mostly appear in groups, buffed up,  with casters... and
also have faction and offer a good place to sell your trash loot
gems while hunting the wyverns et all in the zone.

Haven't looked specifically at the othmir armor, but I believe
it is not trivial at a 250 skill, like the other velious armors... so
indeed you won't see much of it and you can expect to pay a
pretty penny indeed for it.
