Well, my main is a level 45 Druid, and I've been grouping with a (currently)
level 51 Necro for about the past 20 levels.  I have to say, we compliment
each other really well.  I always keep Chloroplast on him because he'd lich
himself to death otherwise, heh..

But all in all, we work very well as a team.  Use his pet as the tank, he
sits back and dots, I dot, keep the pet healthy, thorns the pet, etc...
