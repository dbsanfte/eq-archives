I'm sure option 3 is what they were going for, although whether it 'should'
have been only activated by swinging at the main target is arguable.
Keeping point-blank ae spells from becoming weapon procs seems more
reasonable to me than an across the board nerf to an ability.

Warrior rampage is the operative ability.  Hits all targets once in the 
frontal
arc, and is also the ability used (in combination with slow) for 
shakerpaging,
iirc, so your comment for option 1 still goes.  ;)
