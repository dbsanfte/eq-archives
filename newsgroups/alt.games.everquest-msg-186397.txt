That is totally irrelevant, the fact that there is nothing to see. The
long trips to far off places improves the ability of the world to SEEM
like a world, instead of a collection of Quake levels.

It takes a different mindset of player than those now in EQ perhaps,
but there really are some people out there who would rather have a
world that feels like a world than maximized efficiency in exp
grinding.
