Shadowbane is supposed to r0xx0rz j00 j0xx0rz. I seen the preview anim and
it does look awesome. Alot of people from my guild are currently playing SB,
and have kinda left EQ... maybe they'll come back.. maybe they wont.
I'm kinda fed up with EQ's game design, its outdated and unbalanced to a
degree that its just annoying now. I guess I am burnt out again, maybe i
have to take a year off like i've done previously. The last time I came back
to EQ was because they made something called Manaburn. Ofcourse thats nerfed
today, and I got no inspiration to keep playing my main character anymore.
Endless raiding is all what you can do at level 65. You get so weak at level
65 that the game is ruined at this point. You are more powerful in your own
world at level 20 than you are at level 65. This is a design flaw that is
too complex to fix. That's what the game is built on. It will never change,
maybe EQ2 solves this in a better more reasonable way. I think the main flaw
was that VI tried to keep people playing as long as possible by beefing up
the NPCs to a degree that was outragous. Ofcourse its exactly that which
ruined the flow of the game and the playability.
If Gandalf was a wizard in EQ.. the mobs and other classes would be laughing
at him.

So SB i'm going to give ya a test... :-)


UbeR...At level 65 you cant even go to the toilet without a cleric, shaman
and a tank.
