Well I dont' recall as a "blow by blow", but Spectres (oasis or feerrot) thru
around 40 [they are undead and move at snared speed, you can either outrun
them or fear kite them], City of Mist (lots of undead, can single pull just
about everything) thru 44, Cobalt Scar wyverns thru mid 50s (non KOS you can
easily single pull these and rest all you like, there are better mobs but
nothing more restful, plus I had a friend who wanted the skins) and then the
Grey (single pullable undead, plus by now I had DOTs enough to root/rot
instead of root/nuke) followed by the Flies in POD for a couple levels.   I
was able to get decent exp after this once I finally got flagged for POV/POS
by soloing the undead in POV, but by this point I can no longer say half my
exp was soloing, I grouped quite a lot and pushed hard for 65.

I did the undead at the pyramids in DL at some point in there, I forget what
level they were.  Used to solo fungi in Fungusgrove some too.  Oh, and
vampires in Tenebrous Mountains.  And the skeletons in ME.  Can't recall
precise levels on any of those, and didn't necessarily stick to any of them,
went back and forth between targets of interest.  I also used to kill the sea
chest in Cobalt Scar, and the Cobalt Drakes; the former you can claim as a
camp and so have something to kill even if the wyvern hunters are out in
force, or kill wyverns in between if any are up.  The cobalt drakes are
practically never killed but easy for a cleric because they too run slowly as
if snared, a combination of fear and stuns and nukes takes them out while
rarely allowing their vox breath to land.

The beach in Gunthak would be a great place to solo a cleric nowadays, in
fact they are great for just about any class solo or in group, lots and lots
of them, easy to single pull, nice safe spot at the wheel to fight in with no
adds or to rest in between mobs.  My 30 mage is close to being able to solo
there, and yet my shaman was still getting good exp there in his 40s even
grouped with a couple other people.

The key to soloing when your class shouldn't be able to is to find mobs you
can pull and fight single, and scale down your expectations to where you can
actually kill the mob with the resources you -do- have.  Clerics have good
nukes, actually, nice undead ones but good ones even in the "everything"
line, trouble is the long cycle time.  Well if you are going to have to root
the mob in order to nuke it, and noone is going to be meleeing the mob, cycle
time doesn't enter into the equation.  And if you are going to be AFK medding
up after the mob is dead, then the only question becomes, can you kill him on
a full bar of mana?  If not, go find an easier mob, if so, good to go.
Warriors, Rogues, and Monks have to ask "can I kill it on half my HP" because
thats as far as they can reasonably recover; going AFK to regen the other
half their HP bar will mean an hour per kill... but mana regens just as well
from 50% to 100% as it did from 0% to 50%.
