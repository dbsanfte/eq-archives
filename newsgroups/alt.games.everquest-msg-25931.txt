Networking is not yet a possibility, but we do own a portable 100mb Zip
drive with a USB connection.  So, copy the EQ folder lock, stock and barrel
to the new computer and that's it, eh?  I shouldn't have to re-install
anything?  Or should I do it after re-installing the CD's (so all the menus
and shortcuts go in automatically)?  Thanks to everyone for all the help!
