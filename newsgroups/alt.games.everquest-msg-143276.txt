Spider Silk is one of the very few things that has been inflating in price
since the bazaar was rolled out. Spider silks used to sell for around 30pp
per stack on my server (Povar), but I've only seen it for a whopping 10pp
per silk in the bazaar the last few times I've looked.

I am curious, if I buy spider silk in the bazaar, is it typical to spend 5pp
per stack (20) of silk or 5pp for just 1?
