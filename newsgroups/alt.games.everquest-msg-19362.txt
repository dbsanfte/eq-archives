The key is from freeport....

Well, there are 2 ways and both are VERY risky.  The first way is to run 
there.  There are two paths and both will require invisibility; pray it 
does not drop.  (WFP - EC - WC - KF - HHP - EK - Gorge - Runnyeye)  OR  
(WFP - EC - WC - KF - Rivervale - MT - Runnyeye).  With a teleport and 
invisibility/camo *before* the teleport is cast (pray camo/invis does not 
drop) wherever - TP to EK (druid) or NK (wizard) and run to EK - from EK to 
Gorge - Runnyeye.  

Good luck.  Note the bind point issue.  Closest "safe" bind point is the 
gypsy camp in NK.
