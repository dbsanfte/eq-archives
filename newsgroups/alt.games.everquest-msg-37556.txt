Note that Kale can spawn with 3 different quests (velium delivery, spider
legs and friend of the kin), so you may to wait for some SS campers to kill
him before he will give you the bracer quest. You can hand in the items
regardless of which quest he is giving though.

I think you may be able to do the quest when dubious to CoV, but I'm not
certain.
