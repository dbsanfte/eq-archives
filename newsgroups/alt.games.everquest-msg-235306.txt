Honestly hon, at this point it may be time to just consider a new computer... 
:(  I don't know if you are in a position to do this however, so hopefully
someone here will have some idea of how to help, but it really sounds to me
like it would be far less expensive to invest in a new computer than it would
be to upgrade the old one...  

Sorry...
