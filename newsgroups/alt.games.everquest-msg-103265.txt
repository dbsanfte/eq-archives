(Black Alloy bastard Sword, Runic Carver)

have Better AC, look for Crusty or Rygorr here

imo)

> Neck: Ry`Gorr Chain Collar -  Good

> Legs: Blackend Alloy Legplates - Don't pay more than 2pp per AC on these,
Look for FS (Fine Steel), Crusty or Crafted (even Rygorr if the price is
good)

> Head: Skull Shaped Babute - Good, should get one for under 100pp, paid
20pp for mine, and...ahem...still wearing it

> Hand: Ulthork Hide Gloves - FS, Darkmail, Iksar Scaled, Earthen Gaunts are
all more AC and should be under 100pp

> Finger: Jagged Band (x2) -  Good

> Feet: Blood Cruster Leather Boots - FS, Crafted or Even charred, 4ac is
not good for a Warrior, forget the strength, you're a barbarian, it
shouldn't be an issue. Even reinforced leather is better (if I ever see
anyone offering to buy Reinforced I normally make it for them for free)

> Ears: Orc Fang Earring (x2) - Good

> Chest: Chitlin Shell Armor - FS, basically go for the most AC you can
afford, this isn't bad but there are a few AC18 tunics that are Large race
only and so sell for next to nothing

> Back: Cloak of the Ice Bear - Good, if you want to save money and can get
to velious, the Dire Wolf fur cloak is an easy quest
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=976  but this is a good
item to have anyway.

> Arms: Blackend Alloy Armplates - Not bad but would really try and go for
FS if the budget will stretch

> Face: Fine Plate Visor - Good

As you have not given levels of any characters (including the Warrior) I
have no idea what you could get him.
Black Alloy, if you can solo the lower levels of Runnyeye is easy and the
BABS drops off Veterans and Destroyers not just the named.
