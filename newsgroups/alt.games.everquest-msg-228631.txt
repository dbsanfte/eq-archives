Just out of curiosity, what were the mana regen numbers behind Pet
canni? I know a friend of mine (at 65) says it's about 20 mana per
tick which I'd think is pretty reasonable but I've also heard mages
quote 200 mana/tick. If that last number is true, the only surprising
thing is that it took em so long to nerf it.
