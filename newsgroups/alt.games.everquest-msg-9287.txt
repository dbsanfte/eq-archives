/rolls her eyes.

I was playing my level 20 cleric alt the other night when I got a tell
from a stranger asking if I wanted to join a_random_new_guild_00.  I was
not anon or roleplaying, so my class, race, level, AND (most important)
my guild were blatantly displayed.  Told them to do a /who all Ahadi and
note that I'm already guilded, thinking that would end it.  Heh, nope,
the stranger said they'd keep on pestering me until I joined.  Told them
I didn't join guilds of complete strangers, I'm perfectly happy with my 
current guild, and that on top of that my guild has a policy that all
my guilded characters belonged to only that guild.  Besides, I asked
this
guy, how the heck can a guild made up of mostly 20s and under keep a
mid 50s primary character happy and challenged?

Big mistake mentioning my primary.  I got tells from the rest of this
guy's guild asking me to join. Quite a few begging me because they 
thought it would be so cool to have someone who could farm items 
for them.  Had to clean my Ignore list of old entries before I 
could fit their whole guild on to it.  :P
