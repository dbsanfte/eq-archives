Chloroblast takes 5 seconds total to cast and recycle, so if you are chain
casting, the best you can do is once every 5 seconds, 3 seconds for the
first one to land, which can be invaluable.  NT takes a total of 7 seconds
to cast and recycle.

Chlorblast is 385/5 = 77HP/Second
NT is 880/7 = 125.7HP/Second

In the case of the enchanter, you are probably better off with the
Chloroblast, because of the time to land that initial heal.  If you are
healing a melee type, you might want to consider Nature's Touch, as you will
heal the damage back faster, at the same HP to Mana ratio.  Hopefully, you
are not the main healer in too many situations where that difference becomes
critical, but it is a consideration at times.  I know that I would love to
have something better than my Superior Heal, which is currently my best heal
spell.  I have been unable to keep up with the damage being done due to the
amount of HP I can heal over time a few times, and the end result is either
a dead tank, or we have to get out of Dodge because it's a losing battle.
This is usually only an issue if I was unable to land a slow on the mob for
some reason, or if there are too many adds, and not enough crowd control.
