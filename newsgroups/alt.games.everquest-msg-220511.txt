I would not waste too much time getting yourself these two items:

You don't really need extended range 4, because the spells you usually
need range on (harmony and snare) are low level, and the stats on
darkwater pearl necklace don't suck like Ivory Claw necklace. You probably
already know which camp this drops at, but if not, send me an email and
I'll give you the summary. :)

This one would be a "splurge" item, but don't waste too much time getting
yourself one.  One piece of armor I'll never let go of.

All that being said, Frank, what is the graphic of Shadowflame? I want to
help my pally friend get one.  That, and you need to email me and tell me
more about the camp. :D  Rakyn wants the ring that drops from that guy,
you can well imagine.
