Heh, maybe next time you'll believe me when I say that Tactics is a
more interesting zone that HoH? :p  ... which isn't difficult given
that HoH is argueably the easiest and most boring exp zone in all of
EQ.

And yes, it is a stampede of 20-30 (guesstimate) huge Warboars with a
tiny named piglet in the middle of them. The little guy is supposed to
drop decent loot (ornate, runes) but the few times I've killed him
he's had a (mediocre) melee earring.
