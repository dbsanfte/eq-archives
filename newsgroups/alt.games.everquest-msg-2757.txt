I sympathise with you completely.  Its usually one of the things that I make
casters aware of when I join a group.  I also usually inform them to holler
out in all caps if they are being beat upon and are behind me.  I usually
try and keep an eye on the casters health but sometimes it just works out
better for them to yell something, better safe then sorry.
