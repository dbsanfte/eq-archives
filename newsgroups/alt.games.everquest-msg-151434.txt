Hmmm... Quite a bit of stuff...

Fire Beetle Eye (Glad those apparently aren't biodegradeable  :) )
2 Opal Steins (See?  Drinking DOES improve one's charisma! :) )
ES Vambraces (For those days I over-extend my mana)
SBS (to swap out for those days I need AC / Resists)
ES Helm (Now, I don't have to occupy a spell slot for invis)
Amulet of the Grey Wastes (For whenever I decide to hunt in Kedge or the
Grey, on a whim)
Testament of Vaneer (for that extra one point of wis when doing
tradeskills - besides, I just can't bring myself to destroy it... I worked
my arse off for that thing.. :) )
Various odds and ends I collect for tradeskills - such as pottery and
tailoring (still making up my mind which one I want to GM... :) )
