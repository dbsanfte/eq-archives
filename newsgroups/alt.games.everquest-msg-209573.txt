    I think when I'm in my 60's I will be attempting to farm cooler loot
than 20pp per kill, like cazic or seb gear. Have a 59 pally friend who teams
up with an early 60's shammy and they're having loads of fun and making
buckets of plat farming items in dungeons. In fact, now 56, I haven't been
to rathe for a level, and was only there to pick up a few hundred plat to
fund my exping. [yes it costs money to donate peridots, donate for C3 and
Virtue constantly! ;)]

    So no, not envious... rooting and rotting 6 mobs isn't something I'd
enjoy doing I don't think.... but annoyed certainly because it does take a
while for them all to drop, and if it was a one or two at a time thing it
might be a bit quicker and the guy wouldn't be sitting on so many spawns,
for so long.

cheers,
james
