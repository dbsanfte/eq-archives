I think its a great idea for you to take an EQ vacation.  For the past few
months, I have known that you suffered from EQ addiction.  In fact, the only
reason I play every night with you, is to monitor your condition and offer
support where needed.  I see you have finally come to your senses.

Now I will have to log on and find another EQ addict to help.  I love
logging on ALL the time and seeing all the addicted people in EQ and I know
that given enough time and levels, I can help some of them through it all.

Maybe if I get another system and account, I can help even more addicted EQ
players.  I will have to log on now and explore that.... hmmm...
