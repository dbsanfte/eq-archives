Is it possible to assign a hot key that will cause your primary and
secondary melee weapons to switch? I am a 19thlvl rogue and I carry a
piercer and a slash weapons. my slasher gives more damage and the delay is
the same for both.  I want to be able to backstab with the dirk, and then
switch to my sword for slashing.  I know that I can do this by using the
inventory and manually switch them, but want to speed it up.  Saw a strategy
post the other day that allueded to this.

Thanks
