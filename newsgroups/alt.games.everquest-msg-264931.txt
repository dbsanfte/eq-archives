old? decrepit? lol

Maybe in the world of system spec dick waving, I suppose.

My Athlon XP1600+ and GeForce2ti 128MB gets by fine in EQ-Live
at any rate, and clearly is outperforming the systems of many
of the players I group with.  EQ-II will have to wait, I don't
have any large piles of money lying about and demanding that I
spend them on a video game.
