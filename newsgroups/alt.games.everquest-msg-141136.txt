But the skinny is that any of your conjuration based DoT's (Creeping
Crud, Stinging Swarm) will stack with any of your evocation based
DoT's (Immolate), but none of your sub 50 conjuration DoT's will stack
with other conjuration DoT's.  Same goes with sub 50 evocation DoT's.

Now, the two DoT's you get post 50, Breath of Ro (Evo) and Winged
Death (conj) will stack with your sub 50 DoT's of the same spell like.

Example:  At 53 you can stack Winged Death(conj), Drifting
Death(conj), Breath of Ro(evo), and Immolate(evo).

Personally though, I just go with Winged Death and the Stinging Swarm
that is cast with my Elder Spiritist arms.  Fire based DoT's get
resisted way to much to be practical, even with Ro's Firey Sundering.
The conjuration line of DoT's druids get are very, very rarely
resisted.
