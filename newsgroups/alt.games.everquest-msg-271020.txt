   To me, this looks like a sure sign that EQL is having troubles.  People
who gave out the buffs for free were probably doing so at least partially
because they were sorta bored and didn't have much else to do at that
moment.  These people are now gone, leaving the more mercenary buff givers
behind.  Even if you solo, the lower population is affecting you (if you
seek outside buffs, which I would think a large percentage of soloers do). 

    Maybe many of them will be back after the shine wears off of the
competition, or perhaps they won't.  In the meanwhile, people who have
stayed are getting more and more frustrated, and more likely to quit
themselves.
