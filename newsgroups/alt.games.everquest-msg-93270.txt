  It's gotten to the point where I'm *this* close to directing my 
newsreader to throw out anything with the "X-Newsreader: Microsoft 
Outlook Express" header field, as that's what the vast majority of 
clueless top-posters use.
   I realize I'd also be blocking out a small number of people who know 
what they're doing--it's not a perfect solution by any means.

I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
