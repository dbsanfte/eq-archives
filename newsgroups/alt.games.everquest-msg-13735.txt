Some people just don't understand where and when to apply crowd
control (crowd is one hint...)
And the druid in the original post would have been more helpful with a
snare rather than a root. However, I've been in enough groups that
didn't seem to grasp the differences between snare and root as flee
control that it's made me wonder what the heck snarers they've grouped
with before have been up to, or how much time they've spent soloing
and depending on root.
