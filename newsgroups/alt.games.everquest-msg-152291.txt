Me too. Stupid ass poll if you ask me. As soon as I read it, my mind
translated it to mean the following:

"We know there's a ton of shit broken in Luclin, and we know from
experience that there will *be* a ton of shit broken in PoP when we get 
it out in time for christmas. But when you all vote for new content, as
of PoP's release we can just say Fuck Luclin and the Old Content! And if
anybody bitches, we'll just point to this poll and say, "See? We asked
you before."  So too bad, fuckos."

Then again, I may be a tad cynical.

But yeah, I voted that they keep fixing the current problems and game
balance issues.
