Since I am currently waiting for you to claim that whales are fish,
I'd just back off quietly if I were you.

(For the record: I refer to all reptiles as reptiles. Reptiles with 4
limbs, scales, no shell and the modern positioning of their limbs that
enables them to walk more efficiently and occasionally stand upright
as opposed to the old fashioned crocodile thing where the legs stick
out of the body at right angles, I refer to as lizards. Crocodile =/=
lizard. Lizardman = lizard. Iksar = lizard. Sarnak = lizard. By the
way, there are also lizards without external limbs. They look a lot
like snakes, but are still lizards. They're neat. Skinks, I think
they were called...)
