As a retired 59 Warrior myself I can say that making Defensive disc more
usable would not help the main problem Warriors have which is AGRO
generation.  I had several friends in my Guild who I grouped with regularly.
Usually our groups used an equal level or slightly higher level Paladin to
MT and I would assist him.  Then if a Named spawned that was several levels
higher then the Paladin or myself, I would Tank it using my Defense Disc.
If a caster grabbed agro off of the named then the Paladin would do a quick
stun to get agro on himself and then I would Taunt it off of him.
