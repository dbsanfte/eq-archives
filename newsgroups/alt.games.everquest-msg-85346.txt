There are two sides to this.  The design problem with waking the
sleeper is not that it's a one time thing that only one guild will get
to do on each server.  The problem is that on most servers, there is
only one guild that has a chance to be that one guild.

The top guild on my server (Legacy of Steel), for example, will be the
first on my server to do pretty much any high end content that Verant
adds.  When any high end content is added, they are able to get to it
well ahead of everyone else.  That gives them weeks or months of
exclusive access.  That means they first get all the overpowered drops
before Verant tones things down, then they get to farm the place for
the more normal uberloot, until everyone in the guild is equiped with
the best stuff currently in the game.  The second tier of guilds
doesn't get exclusive access when they get there...there are several
of them, and they have to share.  The result is the second tier guilds
don't get as well equiped with the new uberloot.

Then Verant adds the next round of high end content, with uberer loot.
Who is going to get their first?  Legacy of Steel, partly because they
are better equipped from the last round of uberloot farming.  The
combination of being very good players *and* having most people in the
guild have in each slot the best equipment available in the game is
pretty damned powerful.

A large amount of EQ is about equipment, and Verant has managed to
take the game into a "you need equipment to get equipment" trap.
