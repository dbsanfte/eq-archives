Sony Tech didn't help too much for me, just kept sending me the standart
auto-reply saying to download DirectX 8.1...WTF?

Anywho, It seemed to be a modem driver issue.  I had  a Motorola modem, and
seeing as Motorola has decided that they will no longer offer support as of
December 2001, I went to get a new modem.

Removed all old drivers completely (uninstall, registry, etc) and installed
a new US Robotics modem.

Worked great ever since.

Hope this helps.
