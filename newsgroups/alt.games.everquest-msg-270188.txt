I'm not trying to end the discussion, I'm trying to make the point
that Everquest 2, like all other games, isn't for everyone.  It's
built around the idea that to see much of the more interesting
content, you must have a group.  Making that clear on the Isle of
Refuge by having a quest that can't be completed solo seems, to me, to
be a good way of making that point.  And I think it's a good design, I
think groups (and to a lesser extent guilds) should be required for a
lot of things.  So from my perspective, changing this would likely
lead to a worse game, while for others (like you, perhaps) it would
make the game better.
