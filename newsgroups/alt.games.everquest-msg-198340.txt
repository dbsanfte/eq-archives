/agree!  It may be difficult to be level 1 or 2 and have to learn how to do a
corpse run to get that leather tunic back.  It would be a nightmare to have to
learn it at level 11 when you might be so lucky as to have some "real" gear on
a corpse.
I've tried to suggest to some newbie friends that they set up a /loc key and be
prepared to use it, to no avail.  (After all, newbies know everything :) )
And they always have a good *reason* why they can't take time to learn these
things....
