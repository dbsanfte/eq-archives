I've killed the Ho 34 times, gotten 4 GBS.  After I get back from lunch, 
I'll point you to the correct Pyzjn guide, or, I have probably posted it 
before, so do a search on "pyzjn" and "zymyool" and you may find it.

I know it has to have changed slightly because I went through QHills the 
other day and the names of the Skellies have changed.
