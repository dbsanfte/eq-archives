EQ+Win2k+SBLive = problems.

And I remain unconvinced that the problem is *entirely* with EQ.

Under Win98, EQ with an SBLive gave me wonderful 4-speaker sound,
where footsteps for example, move from front left to right rear as
something would walk that way. 

When I bought my house, I lost the cramped little office I was in, and
so I haven't had a 4-speaker setup in almost two years. But even with
the 2-speaker setup I have now, the EQ+Win2k+SBLive combination didn't
work.

My Turtle Beach Santa Cruz is much better than the SBLive, but still
nothing like the perfect 4-speaker sound I had with the SBLive under
Win98.

Ah well, I'm finding I prefer playing with no sound these days.
