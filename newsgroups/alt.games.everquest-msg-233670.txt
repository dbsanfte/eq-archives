Not good or bad groups, few and far between. I should mention that EQ
PS2 isn't EQ as you know it. For example, I had a necro, he had no
fear spell, as a matter of fact I don't recall he would ever get one,
so if you were headed there thinking your EQ strategy would cross
over, it doesn't. All classes are similar, clerics have heal over time
instead of direct heal. So if you go in with the classic EQ solo
mentality, it won't work as efficiently as it did in EQ. Not
impossible just slower.

I shudder to think they will make major game play changes as opposed
to "fine tuning" to EQ2. A lot of people crossing over may be
disappointed. I won't rush into another EQ platform till I read some
websites first.
