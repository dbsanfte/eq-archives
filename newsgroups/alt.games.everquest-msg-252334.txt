:)

The Pali was in Midnight Sea Mail and had a Ghoulbane, and the Bard was 
wielding a Bogling War Spear and a Nertherbian Unguis (sp?) and had half 
a suit of lambent and a Netherbian Breastplate at the time iirc. Not 
remotely twinked.

But we duo a lot, and work well together, and the bard cc 
(lull,mez,charm) was crucial to survival. And we did die occasionally... 
but then if we'd wanted to level faster and easier we would have geared 
up in the bazaar and gone to OT etc like anyone else who wants to PL.
