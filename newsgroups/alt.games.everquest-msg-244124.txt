i'm so glad you all answered that for me

it's nice that it's not just random, that a virus is around, that there is
some purpose behind this annoyance

not to break off into another of the top-5 most common OT posts, but what
help can you offer an outlook express user? i tried xnews but it was
different and i was lazy....does a "good" outlook express exist? something
simple for the simple, but well-desgined as well?

time to go toy with my filter settings, i guess..
