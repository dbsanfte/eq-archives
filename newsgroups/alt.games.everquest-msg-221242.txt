First off, I wish you a speedy and reasonably pain-free recovery.

I have a policy on camping that I follow whether I am the camper or the new 
arrival. If the camp could be held by a person of appropriate level in 
level-appropriate gear, they should be allowed to do so. If the camper is 
only able to control the camp because they are heavily twinked or being 
power-levelled, they shouldn't expect to have exclusive access to a larger 
area than they could normally control otherwise.

I often run twinks through Paludal. It would usually be pretty easy for my 
group to control all of Bandit 1 and the immediately-surrounding critters, 
but when more people show up, we share the place with no misgivings.
