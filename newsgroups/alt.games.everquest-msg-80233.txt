The Soulfire changes will be retroactive, so if you're one of the folks
using them as a click/healer, etc. get your money's worth while you can!

One query about the upcoming soulfire change...
Is it going to be a retroactive change affecting currently existing
soulfires? I am one of the many people out there who possess the item
for the inventory click only. If it's going to be a retroactive change,
I'd like to know so that the time I invested in completing the quest can
be utilized by using the charges before the "nerf".

Answer:
Yes, all Ghoulbanes and SoulFires will be changed, including existing
ones. That's the reason that we're announcing the change, because the
item may become unusable or untradable by some that already posses them.
