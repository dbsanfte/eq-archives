So for no particular reason I was glancing at the EQplayer leaderboard 
for Combine SK.  I thought what they did was add together the primary 
and secondary stats for a class and rank by that sum.

But if you look at
http://eqplayers.station.sony.com/searchLeaders.action?search.server=152&search.report=report13
I have 6 fewer HP than the guy right ahead of me, and 346 MORE mana than 
he does.

21. Murgi 	  Noxious 	 The Combine 	 8,003 	 6,390 	 1,851 	 70 	 126 	 
1,627 	 10 	 9
22. Berg 	  Noxious 	 The Combine 	 7,997 	 6,736 	 2,009 	 70 	 259 	 
1,701 	 10 	 11 	

Now set aside the fact that HP plus Mana is a silly way to rank SK, as 
mana pool is almost never an issue.  I'd apparantly have to pay in order 
to see ranks any other way, and leaderboards are inherently silly enough 
that I won't be shelling out for that.  Plus, at least the two are sort 
of on the same scale, HP plus AC would be even sillier, unless you could 
somehow get the thing to multiply the AC by 5 or some such.

But forget that, since it looks to me like ONLY the primary stat, in 
this case HP, is being used.
