	I guess that's probably not a great subject line, but despite
being Pisces, I'm not all that creative anymore (I am a dreamer tho).

	Anyway, I recently started playing EQ.  First on my
boyfriend's computer/account (that he's had for a little over a
month).  I admit at first that I wasn't too crazy about the game.   I
joined the same server that he was on (a PvP), and created first a
Wood Elf Druid in GFay and kept getting lost.  Then I created a Dark
Elf (forgot what class, but Magician I think) since he was also a DE
and could show me around (not that he did much tho), and again kept
getting lost, so for awhile I said the heck w/ it.  Later, I created a
Human Wizard in Freeport, but immediately got killed by other players
outside the gate.  I decided PvP was not for me, deleted my character
and went on a non-PvP server, created a Human Wizard and have had a
blast ever since.

	So much so that I decided to go out and buy my own game and
get my own account (I'm disappointed that I can't transfer my
character from my bf's account to mine, but oh well, I can at least
still play it on his computer/account).  Have been experimenting w/
different characters (even a couple on the PvP server my bf plays on
so I can play w/ him).  Unfortunately, even tho mine meets the MINIMUM
requirements to run the game, it's still very slow and my monitor and
video card are basically c**p.  When it's nighttime in the game, I
have to sit and wait for daylight because everything is pitch black
(even w/ gamma correction turned up to max).  Kind of takes the fun
out of it (but I still enjoy playing tho).  Maybe someday soon tho I
can replace this dinosaur w/ something faster.

	Anyone spare a few PPs for a new Dell?  :-ï¿½
