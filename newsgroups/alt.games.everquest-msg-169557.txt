Yes he was the epitome of liberal.  Many of the left-wingers you and
your fellow travellers so viciously disparage are honest Christians.
You buy into the hate speech from Limbaugh and his cronies.  And you
listen to power-seekers like Jessie Jackson who differs oh so little
from from all the other populists left or right.  And you associate
a radical bigot like Farrakhan with the left, when he's got more in
common with the KKK than any actual liberal who has ever breathed.
You'll not tar me with a brush aimed at politicians, because I won't
defend the hypocritical bigots you want to use to define "the left".
If you say "greed is good" you are unChristian.  Period.  I don't
give a damn what <you> think a "modern leftist" is or is not.  You
want to define everything in terms of the bullshit spouted by the
political leadership of the day, and I'm telling you that's a load of
crap.  Don't you have a mind of your own?

Which has nothing at all to do with my criticism.  And it's a rare
person ever in history who has had the luxury to succeed or fail
"according to their own efforts".  Free markets have nothing at all
to do with this concept, in fact the freer the market the less
chance your personal efforts will have anything to do with success
or failure.  In a totally free market most people who try to compete
get squished like bugs by the few who manage to gather power, i.e.
the "freedom" is illusory because just as "nature abhors a vacuum"
and rushes to fill it, some people abhor a power vacuum and trample
one another and anybody else who has the misfortune to be underfoot
in their rush to fill it.
