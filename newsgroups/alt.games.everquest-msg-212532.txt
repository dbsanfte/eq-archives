	It doesn't matter if god can see what decisions we might have made.  In
the very moment in which he conceived of a person's existence, he would know
what decisions that person _will_ make, if he is brought into existence as
conceived.

	If he doesn't know that, then he is not omniscient -- and therefore, not
god, just a powerful alien.
