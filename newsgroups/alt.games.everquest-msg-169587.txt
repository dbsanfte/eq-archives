I put up with it, but it only happens when these two conditions are true:

1) Turning some sort of corner where the 'puter has new stuff in it's LOS 
to figure out how to render
2) I'm using the mouse to turn

It -never- happens when I use the keyboard to turn.  There are some corners 
I always go around using the keyboard just to bypass this problem.
