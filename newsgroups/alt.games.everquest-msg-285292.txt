Generally you cant train mobs onto people in WOW. Only time ive been trained 
is in an instance by my own raid, and Im guessing the mechanics of agro are 
different in instances.
Lots of time Ive had people train mobs through me while ive been fighting, 
but they always just ignore me, and if they give up on the original puller 
they just run past me back to their starting spot.

Ive never had any issues from being griefed in WOW by people doing things 
with mobs. Im sure they could do likewise in EQ and save everyone a lot of 
pain, but I guess its not a priority for SOE.
