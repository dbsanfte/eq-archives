Sorry, not specific enough. Yes, video drivers. I am one of the hoards
of players using an NVidia GForce 2 MX 400 (64 MB RAM) card and I got
shut down by the St. Valentines Day Eve Massacre Patch. (I'm claiming
the copyright on this phrase here and now.) Wound up going to the NVidia
22.83 drivers on Friday and got back in action. (Well, except for
completely random music losses everywhere from the loading screen to
some cities, to my never-present battle music.)
