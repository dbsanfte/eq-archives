First, your math is wrong. It should be (referencing Lonely Guy's
Post):

a person with problems + a person with problems = an uber problem =
disaster

By tossing in the first variable "A relationship on Everquest" first,
you are generalizing that ALL relationships in Everquest involve those
variables which Dark Tyger pretty much disproved and I'm sure a vast
majority of EQ players can disprove.

So yes, please take your generalizations and cram that up your ass.
