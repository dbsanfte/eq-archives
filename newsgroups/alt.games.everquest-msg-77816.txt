I can't see it as unethical... can't see there being many takers, but nothing
wrong with it from an ethical standpoint.

Dreadfully inaccurate.  The prices there are generated by averaging
all player reported sales prices on a given article.  While this sounds
good, its subject to several difficulties.

One: Servers differ wildly in terms of how much cash is out there
and what things sell for.

Two: Items vary wildly over time, most prices dropping slowly
as more and more of the item enter the economy, but sometimes
dropping precipitously as a better item becomes readily available,
or raising sharply when the item is somehow nerfed so that it
no longer drops (or drops in a less useful form)

Three: most people don't report their sales.  This means that you
only get price quotes from people who are interested in EQprices
and willing to do at least a little work.

Four: Of the people that do report sales, some are unethical.  Have
an item for sale?  Report some high prices and manipulate the
EQprice up, and you'll get a bigger return.  Know of a "must have"
item you plan to buy?  Report some low prices and manipulate the
EQprice down and you'll save quite a lot.

So, say there's Roll of TP everlasting (ogre/troll only, of course) for
auction and I come to you for a price check.  EQprices shows it
going for 10kpp... but its generally agreed that MT prices are about
half whatever the cross server average is, and further the stuff has been
dropping commonly off ogres bouncers in Ogguk for the past
four months, so its flooding the market, EQprices only has five reported
sales anyway (even though we can be sure thousands have been sold,
they are a 'must have' item) two of those sales are twenty times as high
as anything you've ever heard anyone auction the things for, and there is
now a better drop in Katta, the "two ply roll of TP everlasting" thats
been out there for a month plus everyone has been selling off their
TP supply to buy ponies with.

Not only would I have to trust EQprices, but I'd further have to trust
you to relay the infomation there honestly, and then I'd have to pay
for the favor.  Seems like a pretty big stretch to me.
