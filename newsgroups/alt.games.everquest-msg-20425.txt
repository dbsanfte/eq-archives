        1.  a quick, sharp return in speech or 
                action; counterstroke: a clever riposte.
        2.  Fencing. a quick thrust given after 
                parrying a lunge.

Every time you get hit by a monster, the Riposte skill
gives you a chance to make a free counter-attack swing
in response.  This swing is over and above any melee
swings that you might be making due to autoattack.
Over time this can add up to a substantial amount
of additional damage.

In fact, you don't even need to be meleeing.  If your
Riposte skill is reasonably high, you can just stand
there with autoattack off, and watch your reflexive
Riposte swings take down the monster that's beating on
you.  This is fun to do with greens.

Another handy thing is that if four things are beating
on you, while you're directly meleeing one of them
(the one you have targeted), you'll be (occasionally)
Riposting *each* of the other ones that are hitting you.
So by the time you kill off the one you were directly
meleeing, you may find that your number two target
is already down a substantial amount of health because
of your earlier Ripostes against it.

Just be aware that a monster has to be reasonably
in front of you for Riposte to work.  If something
hits you from behind and triggers a Riposte, you'll
get the usual "you can not see your target" message.
