Well, duh.

Why is a decision based on who you *don't* want to see in office any 
less legitimate than one based on who you do? And since you objected 
before to my subjectivity, I fully expect an objective answer.

Besides, there are electoral systems (such as Instant Runoff and others) 
that could go some way to helping people to vote for the candidates they 
want without handing power on a plate to the candidates they don't. This 
page illustrates some of the alternatives:

Precisely the fact that it's so simple is what makes it so complicated, 
while adding a little bit of sophistication would simplify things no end.
