Allakhazam does include a scattering of tasks in their quest database,
but they're hard to find because the way Alla's is set up doesn't lend
itself to quests that can start with any of several NPCs in several
zones (i.e., various taskmasters).

As with many such wishes, of course, you can do your part to help. :-)
I've been collecting the details on several tasks, as well as the names
of many more tasks that certain TMs have offered, and plan to submit
the data to Allakhazam at some point.
