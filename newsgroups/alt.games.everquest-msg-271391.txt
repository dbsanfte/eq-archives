Yet sometimes circumstances force that to happen.  Consider aviators in
World War I, for example.  There were often units going out without any
seasoned veterans...just pilots who had never even been in a plane a month
earlier.  (Yeah...they didn't last long.  The average lifetime of a pilot
was something like a month or two).

Weren't a lot of the units on D-Day in World War II pretty much green, too?

Or how about the Civil War?

Of course in all of these, they tried to mix in experienced people with the
green people, but I think there were many cases where there just weren't
enough experienced people to go around.  (And sometimes, like in the case of
the WWI aviators, the experiences people weren't all that experienced).

Anyway, I think you've overlooked that in a fantasy MMORPG, we want to
pretend that we are doing things that haven't been done.  When we go to kill
a dragon in a dungeon, we pretend that this isn't a dragon that respawns
every 12 hours and has been killed thousands of times before we got there.
Our party is supposed to be the first to dare venture into the lair and take
on the dreaded beast...so there aren't supposed to be any salted veterans to
tell us how to handle a dragon.

I've always imagined it goes like this.  At low level, in the newbie area,
we've had our basic training, and now we are out in the newbie area
practicing.  The guards are around to save us if we get in over our heads,
and they are giving us tips and lessons (which is not shown in-game).

Meanwhile, and not shown in-game, our characters have been going out on
hunting trips and patrols with slightly higher level characters, learning.
So, in EQ1 terms, if we are in Freeport, we've been out on numerous Orc
patrols to East Commons and Northern Ro.

When we venture to EC or NRo in-game to actually take on the Orc camps with
other players of our level, that represents our character having done enough
training and pratice on those patrols that he is ready to go out on his own.
