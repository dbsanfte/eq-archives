rogues are already one of the most highly desired classes in EQ... I don't
think they need any enhancements in that department whatsoever.

As for more traps.. well in SSRA (high end luclin raiding zone) there are a
lot of traps in the areas of the big named mobs, and at least 1 doorway
thats opened by a rogue.

Theres a lot of lower level zones that have traps/locked doors already..
