Any time you have a problem like that PETITION!  Put in the petition 
where you were going and what happened...don't get nasty about it....and 
   a guide usually, they don't break out the GMs for this kind of 
petition, will summon you over to FV.  Last time, I got summoned within 
5 mins and I wasnt even sure the boat was broke, I was checking so I 
didn't waste my time.
