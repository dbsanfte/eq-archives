Well, ignoring the fact that the level 10, 11, 12, and possibly 13 person 
would not be getting xp with a level 20 joining the group....

The calculation is more like (level+5)/sum of (level+5) of group members.  
So, the level 10 would be getting 15/85s of the xp in the original group 
mentioned.

Aside from all that, I have no clue how SoE decided to implement the 
actual new distribution of xp for when a new member joins the group.
