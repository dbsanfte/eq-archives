[ nuisance_melees_00 opinion of joke #1 ]

Grin! Wonderful ... just when I wanted to point out, that the first
posting missed the following:

The Nuisance raid melee: This can be any kind of melee. They usually
show off their complete lack of math by failing to see there's exactly
26 melees more to buff, that every buff takes 5 or 10 secs cast time
without counting the refresh of the gem, the mana costs, the 18 full
mana bars to burn etc. With every melee wanting 5 buffs, it ends up
buffing the last melee 30 minutes after you started (for poor shammies
without effective group buffs, yet). Doesn't matter to 'Fekin buff me
now I'm bored goddamn' tank_00. Actually they ignore any number. The
standard melees grasp of number is his hands ("me gutz 13 fingehs"),
if he's part of their intellectual elite knowing double digit numbers
already. If he's a troll or ogre, it will be his feet ("Gumbog hav
neet 3 feet"). You can't really be angry with them, since it's the way
they were born. It only gets ugly, if the raid is lead by one of them.

But I guess I didn't really have to point that out. This last posting
was self-explanative :) Thanks.
