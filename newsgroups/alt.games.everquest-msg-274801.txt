In a word...quests.  Lots of them.  There are hundreds available for your 
level.  You should be talking to every NPC in your city and should have your 
quest book maxed out at 50 for a while.  All of these quest will give you 
some sort of XP reward, coin reward, and most importantly items.  At your 
level, you shouldn't have to spend any money on armor or weapons.  Sell any 
items you don't need back to the merchants.  Collect all the loot from 
monsties, you'll soon figure out what the merchants will buy and what they 
won't. You should look into keeping your spells/combat arts upgraded.  Don't 
forget...armor, weapons and skills all 'color con' like the monsties do, so 
try to keep everything as close to orange as possible.

Check out some of the web-sites too  http://www.gry-online.pl/eq2/index.asp 
is really good one.

Have fun!  You've barely scratched the surface of what's out there.
