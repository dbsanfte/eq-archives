That sounds about right, although at 13 you might still consider
skipping that last Shock of Lightning and meleeing it instead.
Give that a try, and see if the mana saving is worth getting beat on.

Another thing to consider is that many creatures will try to run away if
their hitpoints get below about 20% or so.  Instead of that third Shock,
switch to a lower level spell that uses less mana to try to get the mob
to its fleeing point, then sit down and meditate until root breaks and
the mob starts running.  You can then safetly beat it to death from
behind.

You should have put more into INT, but it's not a big enough mistake to
worry about.  You will get your INT to 200+ with items later.  You'll
give up a little more INT when you need to switch to resistence gear at
high leval than someone who had put more points into INT would have, but
on those kind of raids, your job will be big nukes to finish, and the
little stat mistake won't make much of a difference.

Your mana from INT is (INT/5+2)*Level, so for you it is 25*level.
If you'd put 10 more points into INT, it would be 27*level, so at
60, the difference would be 120 mana.  That's about 30 seconds of
medding.
