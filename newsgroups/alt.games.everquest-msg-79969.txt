Orc Fang are fine.  Only other real choice is cougar
claw, with same STR and some DEX, but 1more AC
point apiece.  I have cougar claw on my main rogue
and orc fang on my alt rogue, and to tell the truth, I
don't notice a difference.

> Neck: Split Paw Tooth Necklace AC 2 Cha SVP 5

Orc Fang necklace, or even Collar of Undead
Protection from U. Guk.  You need more AC there.

> Face: Raw Hide Mask AC 2

Your 50 cleric should be able to solo  the
Assassin spawn in Lower Guk.  Sneak yourself
down there and camp out at the bottom of the
ladder, then log on your cleric until you kill the
Assassin.  Get his DE illusion mask...better
AC and stats all around.

> Head: Ulthork Hide Skullcap AC 8 Str 3 Sta -3

Nope, if it is (-) to STA, get rid of it.  Lumberjack
caps from Kunark giants are AC 10 plus some
stats, and they sell cheap.

> Finger: Jagged Band AC 6 Str 3
> Finger: Jagged Band AC 6 Str 3

I wish :-).  JB's are AC 5.  They'll do you until
you can put out cash for some 6 AC/65 hp
velium rings.

> Wrist: Hardened Kodiak Leather Bracer AC 6 Str 3
> Wrist: Hardened Kodiak Leather Bracer AC 6 Str 3

Ravenscale bracers are cheap, and then again,
with a 50 cleric, you could probably  solo the room
in Cazic Thule that drops both bracers and legs.

> Arms: Mesh Armbands AC 4

Upgrade to banded at the least, Ravenscale if
you wanna camp (the Archon in Cazic seems to
never be around), or Ry'Gorr if you pick up some more
cash.

> Hands: Dark Mail Gauntlets AC 10 Dex 5 Mana 50

These are fine for now.

> Sholders: Tattered Sholder Pads AC 2

Yuck.  Banded at the least, crested spaulders depending
on price on your server.

> Chest: Scarab Breatplate AC 14 Str Sta 1 Dex -1 HP 10

One of the most underrated shorty BP's.  Costs what, 22 gp?
Keep it unless you can get a Ravenscale or Ry'Gorr cheap.
Another one to look into is the Brigadine tunic from Lower
Guk.  They sell for almost nothing these days, but 17 AC
and some STR isn't bad for the price.

> Back: Patchwork Cloak AC 3

If you camp the RS Bracers and Legs for your alt in
Cazic Thule, you'll end up with Lizardscale Cloaks and
Shoulders out the butt :-).  Not only is the Cloak a serious
upgrade here, but if you happen on the shoulders and
haven't upgraded that patchwork yet, the LS is better
AC, too.

> Waist: Straw Spun Belt AC 10

That's fine.

> Legs: Drake-Hide Leggings AC Dex Cha 5

Yuck.  Banded or Ravenscale or Ry'Gorr.  You
need AC more than any of that.

> Feet: Raw-Hide Boots AC 4

Nothing wrong with raw-hide, but you seriously
need some banded there.  Also note that anywhere
I've used the word "banded armor" you could also
substitute Blackened Alloy from  the new Liberated
RunnyEye Citadel.  A 50 Cleric should  have no
trouble there, barring running into the Pickclaw Lord
when LOM.  Decent AC, and the added bonus that
it's black, so it looks neat ;-).  STR shouldn't be a
problem for a dwarven rogue.

> Primary: Serrated Bone Dirk 8/27  Proc: Ingulf Darkness

Keep it.  It procs at level 27.  Only way to drop this is
if you get a better damage piercer, but then keep it
for the off-hand.  Crystal grinder (9/27 stats) and Jagged
Chodaki spine (9/25) are both decent upgrades to
be had for cheap, as well as Slime coated harpoon
(10/25) or even a Crystalline Spider Fang (10/22).

> Icetooths Claws 11/29

Throw away.

> Secondary: Stilletto of the Bloodclaw 6/23 Proc: Blood Claw

Fine weapon.  My first rogue was using a SotB and a Dragoon
Dirk until level 43, when he was able to camp dual SBD's
in Guk.  Back when SBD's sold for 2 k :-).  He didn't get an
upgrade until level 49 when he lucked into a Bone Razor.

> Range: Shruikins

Fine.  One of my favorite pieces of gear is my Mrylokar bracer,
that summons throwing daggers.  Saved me 8 inventory
slots, but it doesn't utilize the right-click effect until level
45 anyways, so don't worry about it.

> Ammo:
> Bank:  Chill Dagger 5/21 SVC 10

Put the Chill Dagger in your pack. Slap it in the range
slot when you might fight a caster.  Heck, any resists
when nothing better is around is a good thing.

Look into getting a Bullsmasher from an Ak'Anon quest.  It
is NOT magical, but it's 6/20 and has some stats (how you
get +stats on a non-magical weapon  I have no idea), and it's
a good weapon to use off-hand JUST TO RAISE YOUR 1HB
SKILL.  Your other weapons are still better for you, but it's a
good idea to keep your skills up.

Good luck to you!  Your main increases will come in just
about 3 camps.  RunnyEye, Cazic Thule, and Lower Guk.
Let us know how it turned out!
