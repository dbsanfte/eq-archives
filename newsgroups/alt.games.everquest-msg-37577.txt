Yes, the overwhelming majority of groups are pick-up groups with no one I
know and that could be the reason.

Many have said this is why guilds are such a good thing.  The good ones look
out for their members thus their clerics don't get screwed.  The strongest
warrior in the group becomes the master looter and you can trust you'll get
your fair share and, on top of your fair share, be compensated for Symbols
you cast.  If the guild's large enough, you'll "always" find a group of
guildies that you can join that's within your level range.  They can help
you get items that you need to "bring your own group" to get.  It's the only
way to get your epic item ... though a clicker isn't that big of a deal to
me from what I hear about it.

Last week, I went through an induction "quest" for a guild I thought was a
good one.  However, the "quest" was nothing more than a poorly-organized,
poorly-executed small guild raid.  This from supposedly a role-playing
guild.  Being a cleric, all this "quest" meant to me was simply that I sat
on my behind and waited for someone to need a Revive.  Only once got XP.
Once died.  None of the loot was worth anything to a 38th level cleric ...
or anyone else except a 13th level chanter that was there.  Cuzic Thule I
think was the name of the place.  Never been to it.  Doubt I'll ever return
to it.  On top of this, the guild officer that attended mysteriously
disappeared without saying a word to me or the other inductee and I've yet
to be inducted into the guild to this day.  I'm thinking of not joining now.
Real nice people in the guild but the induction "quest" and lack of being
inducted has left me with a bad taste in my mouth for this guild.

Plus, I'm rising at a faster rate than the members of that guild are.  I've
also had conversations with a few guilds that don't consider you until
you're 40th level and above ... though all say they make an exception for
39th level clerics.  I'm on Tunare server.  The guild I did the "quest" for
seems to have all mains in mid-40's to low-50's and then they seem to start
up and devote their attention to alts and bring them just that far as well.
Rinse, shake, and repeat.  The 40+ guild members say that I'll then have a
hard time leveling past my low 50's in such a guild.

And then there's the RP server.  Been thinking a lot about going to it when
it comes online.  Wonder if they'll allow character transfers to it?  I
really hope they require you to have at least a 20th level character on
another server BEFORE being allowed to transfer it to or start up one on the
RP server.  I feel it would be hard to immerse oneself into RP if some
newbie is always asking out of character how to set up a macro button.
