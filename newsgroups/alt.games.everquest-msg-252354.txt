Well, there are some games that I buy when they come out. Two reasons 
for this:

#1 I've anticipated the title. In this case I sometimes even pre-order a 
game, though that is rare. The last three games I pre-ordered were Port 
Royale II, Sacred and the Diablo II expansion. I had pre-ordered Beyond 
Divinity and Against Rome, but cancelled them after I played the demos. 
Games I might buy when they come out this year are Locomotion (Transport 
Tycoon II), Pirates!2, Zoo Tycoon II and perhaps the new Roller Coaster 
Tycoon, though I'll wait for reviews on the last one. Well, there's a 
pattern here: they are all sequels.

#2 It's a game that many players talk about and that promises to attract 
a following/community. I enjoy talking with people about a new game, 
discussing strategies or likes/dislikes. If you buy a game two years 
after its release, this element will be nearly gone, though there will 
be more patches and "walkthroughs" available. Good examples are 
Neverwinter Nights and Morrowind, but also the Age of Wonders series 
(the community at heavengames.com).

Thanks for removing the pre-face signature, by the way. I can actually 
read your messages now. (Bit tedious to scroll on a low resolution.)
