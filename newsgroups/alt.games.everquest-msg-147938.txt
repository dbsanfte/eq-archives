I don't think the artist really plays EQ much...
The dude on the right is wearing an open robe with SC-Hand Wraps
draped over his belt (I think).
First of all: Robe graphics aren't open.
Second of all: You wear the SC-Hand Wraps on your hands & they are
supposed to be white.
Thirdly: Wizzies don't wear Helmets.
But whatever...
The Warrior Picture looks pretty cool though- but I would raise the
horns a bit on the helm...

What's with the text? I get the first part...but fires of adversity?
Wizards cast damage spells that are fire based- but the average person
seeing the shirt isn't gonna know that. Duh!

Me thinks the artist needs to understand the game a bit more...

Later
