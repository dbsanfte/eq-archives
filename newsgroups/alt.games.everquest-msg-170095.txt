Lets get 1 thing straight, levels 1-10 have been changed for faster
levelling, and an additional dungeon bonus to all chars up til 30th level.
Nothing more than that has happend for nearly 4 years with positive XP
modifiers (yes i've played that long), so i don't have the faintest idea
what you are rambling on about.
If you think the removal of hell levels means you level faster, then you
misunderstood how they did it. They smoothed out the XP amongst the levels
so you dont get hit with a hell level anymore, but you still need the same
amount of XP.

Also according to reports, blues no longer give as much XP as they did (and
yes this still holds true after they repatched and said they fixed this). So
in a sense, you can level to 10 without a problem, and get to 30 without
much hassle and then the XP goes slower than ever before (because of the
patch where they wanted to encourage grouping, nerfed XP, then unnerfed it
about 92%) This means that XP between levels 30+ is slower than ever before.

Whilest one of my chars made it to 40 in about 6 days of playing (is 45 now
and played 13 days, but some of that was in the bazaar). But there is so
much downtime in EQ its sick, in actuall fact, i think i sit and med most of
a playing night instead of actually playing the game. This is something many
people have groaned about. HP and MANA should both regen faster so we can
actually play the game more actively.

Unessesary mindless slaughtering of different MOBs, you must think the MOBs
in Norrath must have one hell of a sex drive to keep repopulating the world.
