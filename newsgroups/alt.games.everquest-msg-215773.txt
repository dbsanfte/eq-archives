At your level a nice weapon would be very handy to have (until level 20 max,
I would say) but besides that, INT, INT, INT.  Summoning a pet takes a LOT
of mana when you're not twinked at all.

I created my mage more than 4 years ago and I STILL remember DREADING
summoning a pet that would invariably cost me 1/3 to 1/2 of my mana bar (not
including fizzles).
