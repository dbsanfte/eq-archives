I think it was with PoP that the interface changed completely. 

I orginally started playing shortly after Luclin was released, and had
the old UI. I could hit F10 I think to go to a Hi-res mode, but there
were still a few bugs in it...i.e. I couldn't open my inventory
without switching back to the old UI. I quit for a few months, came
back post-PoP, and found the new UI with no way to return to the old
UI. 

FWIW...
