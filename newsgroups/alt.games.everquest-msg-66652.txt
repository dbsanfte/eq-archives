Really? I think the new human female is tres sexxae. My wood elf druid
got ripped though =/ In her chain look with verm and ES and the short
reddish hair I picked for her she ends up looking like a boyish peter
pan since her feminine attributes don't really stand out.

Even with my pants off my bottom has been exchanged with the old
female human monks or something =/ The new female humans meanwhile
have got a total reshaping in that department.
