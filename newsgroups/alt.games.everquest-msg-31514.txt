Hey Lokari,  I'll bet you have never camped a MOB have you?  If you did, you
are breaking a rule in EQ.

People like you are the idiots of the world.  The ones who feel it is there
divine right to interfere with everyone else and what the do.  You probably
complain that there is too much violence/sex/vulgarity/etc. on TV and rather
than doing something intelligent like turning the TV off, you complain like a
puss about getting it changed.  Life isn't perfect, deal with it...MORON
