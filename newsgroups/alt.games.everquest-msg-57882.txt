Okay, quick follow-up to my post here. I just "spoke" to an AOL rep. on the
billing chat facility you get with AOL and he says that (a) this window only
comes up due to inactivity on your/our part and (b) it's the same pop-up
they've always had.

So..... it shouldn't affect online playing at all.

As I said above, I was playing EQ for hours last night no problems at all.

Cheers,

Dave
