I haven't played in a while, but from what I've read, the following still
applies.  The key to EQ micromanagement is mana efficiency.  A necro giving
mana loses a lot right off the bat, and so the recipient of that mana needs
to be able to make very good use of it for the transfer to be worth it.
Otherwise, it is more efficient for the Necro to use it for something else.

Note that one way to increase mana efficiency is to reduce the amount of
needed to accomplish a given task.  For example, if a Necro can make the mob
go down twice as fast, the mob will do less damage to the tank, so the
Cleric will not need to heal as much.  If the Necro can reduce the DPS of
the mob, that further increases the groups mana efficiency.

A rather striking illustration of this was the Shaman/Cleric situation
before Kunark.  In level 49 or 50 groups, for most XP groups, if a group had
to pick either a Cleric or a Shaman as their healer, the Shaman was the
better choice.  The Cleric could heal better, but the Shaman could slow the
mobs so much that their damage output was kept down to where the Shaman's
healing was fine.
