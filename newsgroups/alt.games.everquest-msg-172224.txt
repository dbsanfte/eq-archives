Er, well my mistake (gloves) sorry.. but yes, same mob.
For some reason I thought the lunar whispers effect was gloves not neck

We killed him once, strands and codex dropped.. they rotted.

The stained robes is a piece of crap, so lets see.. 3 useless drops, 2 rare
nice drops.

You know, Velk drops one of the best robes for wizzies (right click nuke)...
easily the best risk v reward.. it doesnt mean his loot is godly or
jaw-dropping tho - 1 nice uber rare drop with a pile of shit drops = not
jaw-dropping
