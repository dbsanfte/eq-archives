There is a nice list of druid-usable FT items at eqdruids.com under Items.

While this is not the best resource for an arcane caster (arcane caster =
INT user, divine caster = WIS user), it is certainly a good place to start
looking. One thing you will note is that the majority of the items are from
"uber" zones, and you are not likely to see anything with more than FT1-3 at
any level below the mid-50's, other than the Earring of the Solstice (4-8k
to collect the items needed for the final no-fail combine) or the 7th or 8th
Coldain Prayer Shawl (FT1 and FT3 respectively).

you are MUCH better off picking up the following buffs as often as possible:

Koadic's Endless Intellect - L60 Enchanter 14 mana/tick 2:45 duration + any
enhancements due to the enchanter's items/AA's

Tranquility aka KEI2 - L63 (?) Enchanter 16 mana/tick much shorter duration,
used when you have the enchanter in your group or are pursuing a short-term
goal where you need the increased mana regen more than the duration.

Voice of Quellious aka KEI3 - L65 Enchanter 18 mana/tick, see Tranquiliy

Protection of the Cabbage - L59 Druid ac/hp buff that includes 6 mana/tick
regen and stacks with KEI1/2/3 - this spell is single-target so you need to
be in your mid-40's to receive it but it costs the druid less than half the
mana of the group spell

Protection of the Grove - L60 Druid ac/hp buff, group spell, identical
otherwise to PotC but can be cast on any level character that is grouped
with the druid.

Protection of the Nine - L63 Druid ac/hp buff that increases the hp/ac and
the mana regen is upped to 8.

Blessing of the Nine - L65 Druid group version of Pot9

Spiritual Light - L44 Beastlord group spell, 3 hp/mana per tick, stacks with
KEI1/2/3 and PotWhatever

Spiritual Radiance - L52 Beastlord group spell, 5 hp/mana per tick

Spiritual Purity - L59 Beastlord group spell, 7 hp/mana per tick

Spiritual Dominion - L64 Beastlord group spell, 9 hp/mana per tick

There are cleric equivalents but they are self-only, as are some other druid
mana regen spells, and likely still more I haven't encountered yet.

There is also a mana regen focus effect on some items that gives 5
mana/tick, I forget the name but it's Koadic's something (Expansive Mind?).
It stacks with everything else and doesn't count towards the FT cap (Flowing
Thought items stack with each other to a maximum of 15 points total on your
character, in addition to buffs).

One time I calculated the maximum mana regen available to a character with
all possible buffs and max FT/KEM items while sitting or riding a
horse/drogmor to be approximately 60 per tick, or 600 per minute. /drool
