Was the clerics time factored in when he went and got that epic which gives
"free ress." Tell you what, you sit in SolB (old) now Skyfire, six straight
days hallucinating while keeping other guilds a bay with threats of, "Me and
my guild r gunna ks your biatch ass"

Clerics pay their dues

Ress'd a guy, someone trained us, guy pops in during fight, dies. I get the
rudest tells imaginable for 5 minutes telling me what a stupid mother
Schuker i am. So I told him he isn't getting the second ress then. People
think Ress's are free and clerics are doormats. to them I say *in Aliaster
Allen voice* why you stupid little fuckwit.
