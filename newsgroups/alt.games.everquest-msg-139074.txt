Granted, and if you got past the rant block to the last paragraph you
will see that I recognized the economics reason, in terms of what most
people want and pay to see.


[Snip the entirely valid expisition on theater operations, with the
provision that even though I recognize and accept the economic
rationale I *STILL* personally prefer longer movies.]

Just a few minor mathematical quibbles.  I'm a mathematical kind of
person, so I notice these things!  :)

20 minutes, not 15.

3hr + 20mn + 3hr + 20mn + 3hr + 20mn + 3hr = 13 hours.

Remember that if you have n showings of a movie, there are n - 1 gaps
between them.

Again, the n-1 rule.  3 showings of a 4 hour movie is 12 hours,
leaving 1 hour for sales/cleaning time.  There are only 2 intervals
between 3 showings, so each interval is 30 minutes.

>	Have *5* showings of a 2 hour movie, with almost *25 minutes* between 

5 showings of a 2-hour movie is 10 total hours, leaving 3 hours for
the intervals.  There are 5 - 1 = 4 intervals in that time, so each
interval is 45 minutes.

>	Have *6* showings of a 1.5 hour movie, with a luxurious 40 minutes 
>between showings -- or even *7* showings with over 20 minutes!

6 * 1.5 = 9 hours, 13 - 9 = 4 hours, 4 / (6-1) = 0.8 hrs = 48 minutes.

7 * 1.5 = 10.5 hours, 13 - 10.5 = 2.5 hours, 2.5 / (7-1) = 25 minutes.

Yes, I know you want to flog me by now.  :)  I'm a stickler for math.

Which is why I said it sucks to be me at movietime.
