}Actually, none of these violate the naming rules, that I can see.
}"Tigole Bitties" is okay because Spoonerisms are not disallowed.

A spoonerism is a type of deliberate misspelling.  Disallowed.

}"Thundercat" is marginal, but okay because it's not the name of a
}work or character of popular fiction (which it would be if it
}were "Thundercats" with an "s").

Thundercats are GO!!  Sorry, just had to do it.

}And "Manalope" isn't anything at all, other than a possible
}cross between "man" and "antelope".

Yup, altavista turned up no matches.
