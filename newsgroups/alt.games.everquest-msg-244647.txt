>So any suggestions on good fun, soloable quests for my >lvl?

You could look into the Qeynos badge quests. You should be able to solo the
first 4 parts, and maybe get a small posse to help you kill Barducks for the

Just check out quests starting in Qeynos (can't even remember if it's North
or South).
