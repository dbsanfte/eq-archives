And what was with the "duh" anyway?  You can tell me I'm wrong without also
telling me I'm a moron.  The entry was not a real concern, since I know two
reasons why that situation cannot happen.  The issue of my personal
ignorance aside, perhaps it's occurred to you that not everyone knows
everything you know.  Perhaps it has further occurred to you that you do not
know everything everyone else knows.  If you insist on being childlike and
belittling, here's one for you, Matt: What guild are my two RL friends'
characters part of?  You don't know?  Gee, you must be a real dumbass.
