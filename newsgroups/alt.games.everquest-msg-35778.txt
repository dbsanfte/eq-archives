Best of the Best Event Rule Sheet
Enchanter 54+

Spectator and General Rulings

Due to the use of NPCs in this event Spectators will not be allowed to
attend. Any spectators found in the arena will be removed and asked not to
return.

Guides and GM's are considered judges and therefore restricted from being
attacked. Anyone found attacking a GM or Guide may be banished from the
Arena or death touched without warning.

The Arena is off limits to unauthorized PvP 15 minutes before and 15 minutes
after the event. This is to ensure that the contestants and spectators are
safe.

The EULA and Rules of Conduct bind all spectators and contestants as set
forth by SOE and Verant Interactive, Inc.

Spectators and Contestants found breaking the rules could have actions taken
against their account including suspension or possible banning.
--------------------------------------------------
So first off they say, "Due to the use of NPCs in this event Spectators will
not be allowed to attend." then later follow that by sounding as if they
plan on spectators attending.  Do they often not allow us to watch?  Why
can't they just allow us to watch from a further away viewpoint?
    What do most people think the best of the "Best of the Best" tournaments
is to attend and why?  Personally I think the Shadow Knight, Warrior, and
possibly Necromancer and Wizard, maybe also Druid would be fun to watch.  My
first one to see was the cleric and I didn't like it as much because it was
more just standing around casting.  Near the end the two clerics started
using melee to interrupt casting.  I liked the bard event better.  I was
moving on the day that the Druid event was held so I didn't get to watch it.
    And point of advice.  If you camped out an alt character in the arena
after the last tournament, and logged into this one late, make sure you did
NOT camp out in the fighting part of the platform (as my Ogre did).  I
didn't get yelled at for it, but I noticed as soon as I did that they did
close the zone off so no one else could enter.  I guess they realized it was
partly their mistake.  I didn't interrupt anything because it was just
before the buffing session started and characters were being called up to
the platform (how does this work? Do GMs give direct tells to them to let
them know its their turn?).  Also I read in the rules one time that /shout
is not allowed for spectator use, but /ooc is (or maybe the other way
around).  How can I see if my /ooc /shout and /auction are turned off?
Wasn't there a way to disable or enable ability to see those?  What was the
command for that?
