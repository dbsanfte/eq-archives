Unimaginative but okay

Petitionable if someone wanted to be anal about it

>Chickenwang 34 Iksar Necro (i just thought it was too damn funny)

Easily petitionable like all names with "wang" in them

>Michelle Jadefox 51 monk (jadefox after the character in Hidden dragon
>Michelle after the actor's name)

Naming your character Michelle is one sure way to make everyone think
you're a guy playing a girl for all the wrong reasons. Even if it
isn't true (even if you really are a girl!), it sets off warning flags
all over the place. :-p Some real names get this effect, some don't.
Michelle is one that would. Btw that shouldn't even get through the
namefilter.

>Toejam halfling ranger lvl 30 (i just thouht is was funny)

Funny if you're 12 maybe

>Battlehog Rottentoof lvl 20 troll beastlord (funny?)

Not funny. Not a 'wrong' name but not very funny.

>Shortydowhop lvl 20 mage....gnome (funny?)

No.

>Now Im a very mature player 27 years old...

As of this moment we have no proof of that, and, ironically enough,
that would not be my first guess if I were to judge you from your
names. If you were lfg and none of us had ever heard of you before,
that may well be enough to get you passed over. Is it worth it?

>and I play all my classes
>well..but I was wondering if any of these name may cause people to
>think...."bah 12 year old kid..im not grouping with him"..

Some of them would make you the second choice of a choice between two
equal possibilities. Its part of a first impression. Sure the first
impression might be wrong, but then, for some people, it may be the
only chance you get.

Though for the record 'good' fantasy names that are totally blah are
almost as bad, because it doesn't help you stand out from the millions
of others with a similar name (like Haradaf or something for a dwarf,
for instance).
