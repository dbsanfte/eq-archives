    Wow, that's a sticky one. Normally, when it comes to life-or-death, the
support people (healer, mezzer) are the ones to call evac as they know when
they're about to give out. But this is a case where you could (in theory)
still get the win on the adventure if you toughed it out, even though it
would likely kill you all. I think I might have to agree with the angry
guy - it's up to the group leader to decide if dying is worth getting the
win. The healer can determine if you're all going to die, but that's not the
only factor that goes into whether the group can kill the named or not.
