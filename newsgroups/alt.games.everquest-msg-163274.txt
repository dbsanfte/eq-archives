What's the single change made to Everquest that
has most *improved* the game for you?

This can include abilities that were added but later
nerfed, as long as you had a decent chance to profit
from it. It should *not* include nerfs to *other* classes.

eg. PoK ports qualify because everybody who bought
the expansion gained some port ability, and existing
ported gained to ability to "port" to some new locations.
- Bazaar counts, made exchanging goods easier for everyone.
- KEI counts because most casters can get a long-lasting
mana buff.
- Allowing characters < level 10 to die with little penalty
- Introduction of a nifty new class or race that you love

Also, what "improvement" to the game do you most dislike?
eg. - PoK ports because you're a druid and porting
market collapsed
- KEI because you're an enchanter and suddenly everybody
has KEI and no longer wants to group with you
- Changes to resists (to make high-level MOBs easier
to cast on) because suddenly greens can hurt you with spells
- druid/shaman "almost-CHeals" because you're a cleric
and suddenly high-level groups no longer *need* you

Note that I disagree with much of the latter list(*) and
haven't been playing long enough to come up with a
good list for the best "good" improvements... so, over
to you.

        ...Ronny

(*) Agree with KEI, not sure about resists, disagree
with the others, if you must know.
