Sure, you can get a Solstice Earring for about 6k - that's
FT1 or about a 10% improvement to your current mana regen. 
The droppable FT items are mostly level restricted I believe,
and the cost goes way up from the Solstice earring anyway.

Higher int will just give you a bigger mana pool, which means
you'll take even longer to go from OOM to FM.

And it looks like they may get rid of the loophole that allows
folks to cast KEI on low levels.

So, basically you just have to learn to manage your mana - it's
a good skill to have, even at 63 with XPG, KEI and SP on and
sitting on a horse (total regen 46 mana per tick) I still have
to watch my mana use.
