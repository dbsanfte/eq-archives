Nope.
They are green to me at 60 (or were until they added the light blue
range--some are light blue, some are green, only the rare cobalt
drakes are blue...and of course the named wyvern).  Level 45 mobs
would be solid blue to a level 60.

No ranger would solo in CS.

Bullshit.

Wizard:

Scope out to see if there's any four mobs within a reasonable distance
to aggro (pray it doesn't rain since you can't see jack shit).
Proceed to snare them with your 2 minute lasting snare and hope you
can gather the other 3 before that snare poofs (unless of course you
want to use the 125 mana version that lasts a whopping 30 seconds
more).

If by some miracle, you managed to find 4 unoccupied mobs while
competing with 12 necros, 8 other wizards and 4 druids in the zone,
you proceed to burn another 75 x 3 mana to snare those buggers.

Now, spend about 20 to 30 seconds spinning in a circle to get them
nicely clustered.  

THEN you get to drop 3 x 350ish mana (Pillar of Whatever) while
praying you don't get partials or total resists since then you have to
chain more nukes.  All the while making sure you don't pull that shit
too close to the damn otters (AoE might piss them off), sirens (they
hate you), or buthars (they also hate you).

Once that's done, sit on your ass to med back the mana.  Total elapsed
time: probably 7 to 8 mins *IF* you got lucky and found four wyverns.

No, Ranger:

Hit Track.  Find blue animal mob.  Snare animal.  Fear animal.  Toss a
dot/debuff.  Now beat the shit out of it (toss in the occasional
fear--which casts in some stupidly low casting time).  60 seconds
later, hit Track, find blue animal, snare, fear, beat the shit out of
it, 60 seconds later, ... you get the general idea.

As long as there are animal based mobs for rangers to fear, they are
basically doing exactly what necros do--fear kiting.  And that is an
incredibly efficient form of soloing.
