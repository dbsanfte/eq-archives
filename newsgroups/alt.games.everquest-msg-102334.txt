This isn't as unusual as you think. Do you go to many movies? The
trailers shown in the theatre are often FAR ahead of the release. As I
recall Titan AE's teaser was something over a year before it was
released. 9 months isn't that odd. Just the publixity over the trailer
is whats unusual... and not very unusual for something like LotR. :-)
