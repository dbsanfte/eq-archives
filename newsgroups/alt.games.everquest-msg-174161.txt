That's fine, I'd like to pull all our troops out of South Korea, since they
don't want us, and let the communists take over.  Hell, let's pull out of
Saudi Arabia as well, let Iraq roll in and take control.  It's a shame we
maintained our bases in Germany through the cold war, I figure they could
have re-unified much earlier if we weren't there... granted, it would have
been under communist rule.  And hell, lets get rid of all our foreign aid
while we're at it.  We can go back into the isolationism we had before the
second world war, and you can criticize us for that, too.  At least it would
be a change in the criticism.
