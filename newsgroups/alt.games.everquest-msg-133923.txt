The Black Sheep said:
}I seriously doubt he has ever read the text of any law, 

True enough.  Maybe after he learns what this 'reading' thing is all 
about.  Even if he had, I'm sure he'd interpret it to mean whatever he 
wanted, regardless of what it actually said.

}and has yet to show he is basing his opinion
}on anything other than a knee-jerk reaction to his pet "axis of evil"-
}anything or anyone he can label as PC.

Yep.  "Oooh, I labeled it PC!  Therefore, it must be PC!  And PC must be 
bad!"  I wonder if he even knows what PC actually means?
