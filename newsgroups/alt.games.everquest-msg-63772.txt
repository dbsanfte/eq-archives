Well, whatever errors they may encounter, I am sure that anyone that knows
any better and isn't an instant gratification freak, will keep whatever they
should loot off of any mobs.  Personally, I will be taking just the
necessities, which them themselves will be placed in the 8 tinkerers bags I
have ready to roll.

If there are any incoherentcies in my wording, I must applogize as I have
been up all night fine tuning and deciding what I should do to my system and
how much I am willing to spend on this game (errm, how much more I should
say).  <grin>  Nice thing about being a sole proprietor is that I officially
declared today my day off of work. ;p
