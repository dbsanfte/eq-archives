Agreed. The latest movies lack much of what made the originals so
good. Mostly compelling characters and stories. The characters in the
new trilogies are so DULL and unlikeable. They're all clones of Ferris
Bueller's high scool teacher. Events dont happen for compelling
reasons, just we're expected to accept them because they are supposed
to happen. The little love story between Anakin and Padme isnt
convincing or especially endearing. It takes a little more than canned
dialogue and a little frolick in the grass. The only somewhat
compelling character was really Darth Maul and suffered a really
dissapointing death.

It takes alot more than CGI to make a good movie. But the new movies
are ironically similar to SWG - all eye candy - no content.
