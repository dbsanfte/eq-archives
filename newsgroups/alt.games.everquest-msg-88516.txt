I'm curious as to whether anyone knows of a good spot in which a
cleric could raise defense at level 40?  I only need 9 more points.
Up until this point I've been able to find mobs that I can actually
melee to death, rooting them and healing myself as necessary.  Now
mobs are too tough (tried it with a Butcherblock dwarf for laughs)
Ideally, the spawn would be something close to a zone line so I could
escape easily. I don't care that I don't gain experience.
