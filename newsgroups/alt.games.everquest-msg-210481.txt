Hi all.  First time poster here.  I've been lurking for about 3 months
learning some really fun stuff.  My Iksar Beastlord is up to level 51 now,
and I've found I really enjoy soloing in Dulak when I can't get a group.  My
major issue is getting there and back though.  As a hybrid, gate isn't an
option, so I'm looking into items I can have to port me back anywhere where
I can access a PoK book or something.  I've got my hands on a couple of gate
potions, but they're running at least 300pp per in the bazaar, so using them
regularly is out (I've got about 4k in the bank, but I'd rather not spend my
baking fund on gate potions =P).

I've managed to find a druid on occasion, or sometimes, a wizard who can tl
me to my bind in PoK, but I hate relying on others to get me around when I'm
not specifically grouping/raiding.  My guild druids are getting a bit sick
of me asking to be picked up in Stonebrunt by now =P.  So my question is,
what other items are there to get me around?  I'm thinking there's some
pottery recipe for something I could do, but I only ended up finding the
spiritstone(?) recipes for shamen.  I don't really mind finding a ride to
Stonebrunt from PoK, since there's always someone offering, but the return
trip is my concern.  Any recommendations?

Thanks
