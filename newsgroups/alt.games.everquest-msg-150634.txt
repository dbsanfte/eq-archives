Well Lyrral,

I've grouped with an alt of yours a time or two (in Unrest, back when the
alt was about 26ish? or so), and even traded a tell or two since then. I
still have you on my friends list even (both Lyrral and the alt that has
escaped my mind for some reason). Since my bard is both my main and my first
toon, let me step forward with a little defense of the newbs who choose
bards, and a little slapping around of them myself.

Basically, I have to agree with what's been said in the followups - a bard
can be someone's first toon, but they have to be pretty dedicated to the
task. In my case, I was quickly introduced to EQDiva (thank goodness!), and
I played regularly with other peeps rather than soloing (Bards can be a
pretty good solo class, but, frankly, I've never been a solo kind of person,
and, when I do, I play my mage). I sponged over ounce of info I could into
what they were doing, why, etc.. I knew from the beginning that a bard was a
jack of all trades kind of toon, so I have spent a lot of time figuring out
which songs emulate what other classes. While I am, and always will be, a
melee oriented bard, I still look over my group EVERY time to see what my
role should be. Questions like:

Do we have a chanter? If not, are we in a situation where we may get major
pulls? (Recognize that I'm probably crowd control in this case, and mem
songs accordingly)
Do we have a healer? No? Please tell me you're yelling for one at the top of
your lungs? OK, I guess I'm the healer - I just hope you don't expect it to
happen fast... lol
Are we caster or melee oriented? I can twist 3 plus insert others from time
to time as appropriate, but I will always favor a particular toon (if I miss
a twist, which one is it that I'm going to make sure doesn't falter?).
Sometimes haste or Resists are a lot more important than mana regen? I can
switch instruments, but I HATE doing so - just makes for way too much work
(game loses a bit of the fun for me if I'm straining for it).
Are we fighting casters, or strict melee (slows vs. resists)

The list goes on a on. I suspect regularly that I would be a better bard if
I had played other tunes first, but I would say that I've done "OK" with my
bard all along. I just have to wonder whether I'd be better - but I'm always
working on being better. Indeed, that's why I have several casters now, and
I watch for what I do and don't like about the bards in my groups, and I
watch for what a difference a bard would make in some places.

Basically, I think that a bard is typically a bad choice for first timers.
It can be done, but someone had better be darn serious about it. For me, I
had the advantage of playing RPG's for years, and knowing the typical party
roles for different classes - it was merely figuring out how EQ applied
specific RPG concepts and where did a bard fit in - so I had a head start.

See ya on Povar!
