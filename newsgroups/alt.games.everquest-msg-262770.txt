While I understand what you are saying, there are cases where who is NOT 
the president can be more important to people than who is.  This is one 
such case.  I feel compelled to do everything I can within the system to 
raise the odds against the person I do not want to be president.  To be 
totally honest, there is noone running for president that I really want 
to have the position, anyone who wants the position should not have it.  
There are candidates I prefer over other candidates, but, given our 
current system, there are two viable candidates, and I must make a choice 
between them.
