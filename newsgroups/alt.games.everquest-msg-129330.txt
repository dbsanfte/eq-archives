Hum, you make a good point about folks exploiting bogus LD's - It probably
is a case of suck it up and eat the death :(

I rarely have LD's and when I do usually nothing bad happens but in the last
5 days I have had two and both times I was kiting mobs in out of the way
zones - not good things come of that!  It is very annoying to say the least.
The fact that on both occasions when I tried to port from my bound site, my
PC locked up (6 months old 2Ghz P4, GForce3, 512Mb RAM) made me think it
might be more than a simple dropped connection.
