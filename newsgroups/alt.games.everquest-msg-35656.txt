    I was non-KOS to CoV, but barely. I went to ToV with a guild, and as a
cleric in a group with no warrior I didn't have to combat heal for some
time. My factions did not change, even when I was hit by a breath weapon
from a pull. Furthermore, by /conning mobs that hit me with breath weapons I
could see clearly I was NOT being added to any hate lists unless I healed in
combat.
