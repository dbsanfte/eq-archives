Hi All;

I read an article about how great the Nostromo speedpad is for games. I fell
for the hype and got one. With EQ being keyboard heavy for all the different
key combo's to do all the things we need to do, it sounded like this might
be a good answer. Being able to have so many key commands at your finger
tips sounded very enticing hoping to not look and act like a piano player
when playing EQ. Well.........now I'm not so sure.  Theory sounds good until
you put it to practical use.

I have 14 days to return this for a refund. I would like to ask, is anyone
using this for EQ; Do you like it; basically how do you have it setup? I
don't play other games, so I'm not interested in how good it might be for
something else.

Thank you all once again for your time and suggestions.
