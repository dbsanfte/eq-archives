Nortlav is just insane. I've tried him three times so far. And I don't
mean one of the hastily pulled together, stupidly minimal forces type
thing like we've pulled on VSR, either. I'm talking just about every
single post fifty player in our guild, with some two boxing at that.

Never even gotten close. I don't think we've gotten him to half health.
Fuck, I don't think we've gotten him down a quarter. Of course, now
almost all the tanks and bards have red scales thanks to a level 52
assistant raid leader who has been kocking Naggy down every time he pops
for the last month or more. :-)  So I may just say a hearty "Fuck
Nortlav and his little dog too" and never go down there again.  If
you're not after scales, the rest of his loot is total crap anyway.
