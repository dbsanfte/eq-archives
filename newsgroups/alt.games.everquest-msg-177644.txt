Our guild has been getting some decent melee loot lately, so we're ready to 
try for some stuff to help the casters upgrade.  A wizard heard that UP has 
some decent stuff, so we're going to head that way, soon.  The only things 
I have heard about UP are "Hard mobs, good loot, ND-DRD stuff rots a lot."  
Not much to go on.

As of now, I don't even know where UP is, but I'll look that up later 
tonight.

What mobs would you guys suggest for a guild to go after for some fun 
exploration and some decent loot ( mainly for [ all ] casters )?  We'll 
probably have about 10 people, mostly 50+, with the standard class types 
represented ( tanks, clc, bkp heal, cc, etc ).

Any hints on particular mobs, loot, strategies, etc. are very welcome and 
appreciated.
