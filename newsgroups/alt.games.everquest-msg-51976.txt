.....this is a kinda oddity i have found in the world of EQ. When i would try
to be a greedy shmuck and try to get donations id have a few people maybe
wonder by wanting on and giving me about 1-3pp....but when i put FREE SOWS AT
TUNNEL poke the fat troll!!! i would get large groups some paying and some
not...being a non twinked character many would inscept me and give me items
such as
 Froglok totem
 Chitin Shield (unsure about the spelling)
 Chitin Armor 
 Lockjaw tunic
 some large helm for fatties only 10 ac
 and much more in donations....its kind of odd how much better you do if you
dont beg for money rather then sellin free mana...the people in EQ rock!!!
