This is my point.

If 2a is faulty, then 2 is faulty, because arguement 1 implies 2
is identical to arguement 1a implies 2a

Thus you get either conclusion 3a) or you get arguement 1c implies  2c

Propose another.  I suggest that complex things (life, a creator) cannot
arise (or have existed forever) on their own, or they can arise on their
own.  Seems like a clean either/or to me, although I'm sure the thrust of
any counterarguement would have to come here, as you've already grasped.

I think you know the pea is there but the walnut shells have
moved fast enough that you aren't sure which one its under.

I also think my answers above should clarify that for you, but
I'll try and restate.  I don't see how the arguement that life
is to complex to arise naturally can fail to be applicable to
any putative creator of that life, which surely must be at least
on a comperable order of complexity.

If you tell me the diety "just is" then to swallow that I have
to stretch my belief system sufficiently to allow things that
complex to "just be" in which case there's plenty of room
in my credulity to allow life, the universe, and everythign
to "just be" without the help of that "creator."

Note that this does not require evolution or current
scientific theories of any sort to be correct about the
origins of life or big bang hypothesies of any sort.  For
all I know life arose out of nothingness yesterday, with
my current thought structures intact.  Or it has always
existed, and we here on earth are really seedlings from
another world brought here by "ancient astronauts" and
similar things have happened forever (not merely for a
long long time, forever.)

See above.  Having existed forever is not an out for
the creator, since nothing really stops the universe from
existing forever, in fact this is a hotly debated topic
among astrophysists, current trends are in the direction of
a  "big bang" and so forth but nothing is set in stone...


At any rate, if big bang hypothesies are correct, before
the bang there was a nothingness (including no time) which
existed forever (or not since there was no time) and which
may or may not have been preceded by other big bangs
and collapses (if preceded makes sense at all giving the
lack of a time dimension)

I argue here that your "eternal creator" is no simpler than
an "eternal existance" and that if there has been an
eternal existance then it could not have been created.
It seems to me that any arguement which requires existance
to have been created but allows a creator to have always
existed is going to be hard to construct without bringing in
outside facts.

Again, my arguement applies only to the syllogism stated
as 1 implies 2 implies 3

The reason for this is the "fits all KNOWN facts" part.   No
theory can be proven without knowing all facts, and its
always possible that some new, hitherto unknown fact
is going to pop up which eliminates our Least Hypothesis.
On the other hand, any approach which suggests that
we chose more complex theories when simpler ones
are available that fit -all- facts turns in to nothing more
than guesswork with no way of coming up with any
working hypothesis at all.

I think demolish is correct.  If Life requires a creator due
solely to its complexity, surely a creator capable of
creating life must fall under the same arguement.  Thus
the complexity of Life is not in and of itself proof of the
existance of a creator.  Either things like Life and a Creator
can exist on their own, or they cannot.

While its possible that although Life could have existed
on its own while a creator happens to be eternal, this
state of affairs would exist without this proof applying
to it.

This is certainly the best angle of attack I can think of.  Hopefully
I've defended my work above.

In its essence.  At the heart.  A stronger form than simply saying
"meaningless," if you prefer you can simply drop the adjective
and go with pure "meaningless" here.

You get to ignore all the contradictory noise that various priests
and theologists are putting out telling you that you should be
acting in one way or another or often both or neither depending
on which flavor of theologist you are hearing at any given time.
After all, you've already stated that whatever they say does
not really apply to this creator.  If they tell you God wants you
to skip lunch on wednesdays, you can't use this as a basis
for deciding whether to skip lunch or not, since what they
tell you is meaningless.

Oops.  You cannot logically base any actions on any of what
has been said of him.

Just because people -do- base their actions on things of this
nature does not mean they are doing so logically.

Further, this arguement only applies if you insist on maintaining
that God cannot be explained in human terms.  If you want to
concede that God -can- be explained in human terms after
all, then you can go back to acting on the explainations you
have been given without worrying about this line of arguement.

Either they have the terms or they don't.  Any terms
they don't have are not helpful.  If they -do- have
terms then they can use them.  If you introduce new
terms, then those terms stop being ones they don't have.

If you can discuss God in human terms, then it can't
be impossible to discuss God in human terms.  If you
need to invent new terms to do so, then those terms
stop being ones you don't have.  At any given point,
human terms are either meaningful or they are not.

Your statement seemed to imply that the invention of
new terminology was not the crux of the issue, rather
that the discussion itself was not comprehendable
by humans by their very nature.  While I'm happy
to concede that this either is or isn't true (whichever
you like) I feel confident in saying that there are
consequences to either statement... if its true then
we can safely ignore all human discussion regarding
the nature of God, while if its not true then you
can't attack arguements about the nature of God
on the basis that God is incomprehensible.

Hey, its not -my- God we are talking about here~!  Our Chain,
Adam's chain, your chain, my chain... I don't think it really matters

little bit of Supreme Gotcha

"Yanking your chain" means he did not mean what he said, while
"did he mean it" means he did mean what he said.  Is there
a third possibility?

God said not to eat that one too.  Unless I'm mistaken.  Which
is the thrust of my arguement here.  If you can't describe
God in human terms, then its impossible to put any credence
in my claim that he said not to.

Its quite possible (in fact I'd say probable) that this arguement
has already been made, the fact that I thought of it on my
own does not in any way mean that I'm the first to do so.
Not being a hardcore theologist, I'm highly uninformed on
such topics, wouldn't even have a guess as to where to
find out.

Actually I have to note that there are two arguements going
on here, one the putative disproof of the "complexity"
case, and one the discourse regarding the "God cannot
be discussed in human terms" statement.
