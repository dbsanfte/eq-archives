It's not on your list, but I'd recommend trying a beastlord, at least it
will be a different experince.  

Actually what I'd really recommend is playing them all, try them out
till about lv 20-25, you should have a very good idea by then if you
like the class.  I'd recommend twinking minimally until you decide which
you like most, not only will this save your cash, but you will be better
able to decide if thier innate powers are to you liking when relying on
them versus items.  If you really must twink, spend about 100-200 pp on
a weapon and a few hundred on armor.  Any more than that and it will be
the items you are playing not the class.

I wouldn't worry too much about groups with a warrior if you have a
fungi, since you can regen.  I would recommend either an ogre for the
stamina or troll for the extra regen depending on wether you want to
group more or solo more.  I've seen really good warriors of other races,
but when it comes down to it, ogres & trolls are just better able. 

Rangers suck.  :) Now one of my best friends plays one as his main,
however that's not his highest lv char.  That's how bad they suck.  The
only reason I ever want one in a group is harmony or snare.  Good luck
getting a group.  They must be fun to play if so many people suffer
along with them though.  If you'd like playing a ranger I'd expect you
to immediately say Ha they can't suck, and go out and play one just to
spite me.  That's how you'll know if you'll like one :)

Shaman are fun, but I got burned on mine before kunark came out, and I
couldn't get groups in the extreme overcrowding without waiting lists of
3 hours, which is just slightly less than time I had to play.  Mine was
a barbarian, because I didn't want to deal with the faction problems of
the others.  I think trolls or lizys would make better shaman due to
regen - which translates into more mana through canabalize, or an ogre
again for the extra hp.  Trolls also get a snare item available.  Vah
Shir would seem to be about on par with barbarians, weaker than the
other races, but decent faction but have IV - and an excellent starting
city/newb zone.

Monks are definately fun.  Good grouper & decent solo.  Human for uber
fist damage & good faction, lizy for regen, ac, IV...

Hope that helps some.
