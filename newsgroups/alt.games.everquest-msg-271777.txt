This is correct as far as it goes, thing being it becomes relatively 
difficult and expensive to find a weapon with a high enough damage on it 
to actually improve your pet's damage output.

Under level 12, its not hard at all, you only need a damage of 10.  But 
once your pet starts doing 20 points a hit on his own, that won't cut 
it, and weapons with a damage of 11+ are going to run more than a few 
silvers.

It does help that the delay portion of the weapon can be  ignored, 
because a weapon with 20 damage and 60 delay will be much cheaper than 
one with 20 damage and 10 delay... for your pet, both will be the same 
as a 20/30 weapon.  But it won't be long before your pet will outdamage 
a 20 damage weapon just on his own.

Depending on class, there will also come a point where your pet will 
dual weild IF you give him two weapons, but not on his own; thats the 
point where giving him a couple rusty daggers or whatever is lying 
around will help.  Then (for most classes, not for shaman though) there 
will come another point where the pet will dual weild on his own, no 
help needed.

Something else to look at besides the damage and procs and dual weilding 
are the stats; there are some junk weapons and summoned weapons that 
have HP or AC or Dex that can make a difference.
