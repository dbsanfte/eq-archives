It was Sarin nerve gas. But why are you talking about the weapons a
_military_ would use? Weren't we talking about terrorists? If so, the
most likely scenario is Sarin or Anthrax.

There are modern _military grade_ nerve gasses which are pretty damn
lethal. Fortunately, they are excruciatingly difficult to synthesize.

Likewise, they are quite difficult to _deploy_, which is perhaps one
of the saving graces of some of the more tame and available agents
like Sarin or Anthrax.
