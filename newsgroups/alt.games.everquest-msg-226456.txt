But when your tank requires voice of quellious+bard mana song to
maintain agro, you have to wonder if they really were supposed to be
that way. I think the problem is the spell agro thing wasnt as much
part of the original equation as it is now.

As a result pallys and SKs have additional taunt methods over wars
more by chance. They get taunt button like war's which works about the
same, the problem is wars have nothing to compete with that.

The extra hp/ac stuff has been lost too (probably coz SKs/Pallys
whined along the way).. My first real meeting with wars was a huge fat
ugly ogre (shame ogres almost look nice now) and he was as I expected
a huge guy with more hp/str etc than I could dream of and I was in
awe.. Now, Ive met casters with almost as many hp and that I find just
inherantly wrong. When your mage/ench type has as many hp and still ac
over 1000... or your cleric is the MT ..

The game could use a reevaluation..
