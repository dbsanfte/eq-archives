Unbelievable. Sure, we all joked about it, but I never really expected them 
to sell out like this. I could sort of understand it had they done this 
with EQLive, as it's economy is already borked beyond repair, but for 
crying out loud, EQ2 is in its infancy. We still have a *long* way to go 
before facing the scenario where a new player has to buy plat just to be on 
a level playing field with the average player of their level.

Some will say that since it was already happening to a (subjectively) great 
degree, that it only makes sense for them to get their cut. I think that's 
incredibly short-sighted. It completely ignores the negative impact on the 
game as a whole.

Way to go, SoE. You've really stepped in it this time.
