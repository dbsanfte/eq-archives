I'll have to think about it. I can probably afford it, but I don't
game much online. Probably about 10-15 hours per month. I'm on
vacation until next week, so I will probably game more than that
this week...

Well, I was being kinda saracastic. :-)

While I do computer tech support, fewer ulcers and gray hares, I
have a 4 year degree in Vax pascal programming. So it bothers me to
see lousy programming, may or may not bother me more than someone
who isn't a programmer.

Or as one of my sisters has said, 'sometimes I just like to laugh
and point'.

Of course it is. All they would have to do would be add some error
checking routines. But from what I've read in here so far, something
like that might be beyond Sony, et al. Error checking is normal
programming. To leave it out shows idiocy.
