Incorrect. The game has a virtual economy that has a real world exchange 
rate. If the going rate for plat is $10 = 1000pp then I could, in theory 
convert money into pp by buying up plat.

A few weeks later you convert the plat back into hard currency by 
selling it, and you've got clean money.

Plat is entirely untraceable by traditional financial forensics...and 
you could say you got your million pp from selling a lucky drop on a 
raid.... its possible soe keeps adequate logs to disprove this... but 
its hard to say if they do, if they'd hold up in court, and if the 
policy would be savvy enough to check in the first place.

FWIW, I don't think there is enough plat, nor stable enough plat 
exchange rates, to handle real money laundering  efforts... at least not 
at this stage... someday though, possibly.
