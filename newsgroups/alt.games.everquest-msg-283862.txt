	Mr. necro might also not be aware of what's going on.  How many
clerics have seen this:  You meet up in Lavastorm.  Cleric asks "Who needs
buffs?"  No one answers.  You all run to the Nest.  Everyone's gtg. As
the puller says "Incoming 2!" someone sends you a tell: "Can I have
viction for me and the pet, and spell haste?"  

	I really don't see what the big deal is.  Necros never run out
of mana.  Any half assed necro should be able to dot and snare the pull,
twitch the cleric, and kite the adds too. While AFK.
