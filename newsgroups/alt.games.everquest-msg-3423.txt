My very first character was a human warrior. I only played it to level five, and
moved on to other characters and on other servers. But I still remember trying to
learn my way around the game, and I had experimented with all the available skill
buttons once I found them.  I clearly recall my wife looking over my shoulder as I'm
fighting an orc pawn or something, and I hit that one.
"You taunt and orc pawn to ignore others and attack you!"
I said, "What the fuck kind of a feature is THIS????"
I immediatly deleted the hot key and picked another one.
