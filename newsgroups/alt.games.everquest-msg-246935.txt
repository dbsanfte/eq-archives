You might want to wait until they're actually added, before declaring it a
big victory for the long term casual player.  Or at least until a few more
details have been released (unless I missed some?).

From the little snippet on the new expansion website, it mentions "The
quests will be a combination of solo, group and raid content. However, these
weapons are being designed for people at the upper end of the level
spectrum."

The question I'm somewhat interested in is what they mean by "upper end of
the level spectrum."   Do they mean in the 60's?  Level 65?   Level 65 plus
AA?  Level 70 (or whatever they're increasing the cap to)?  Level 70 plus AA
plus PoTime level gear?  What flags are going to be required to get to the
locations you need to go for the quests?

Sony's track record from the original epics is not great.   When the
originals were brought out, they were considered uberguild toys, requiring
the hardest mobs of the current expansion to be killed.   If Epic 2.0
requires drops from Vex Thall, Plane of Time, Whatever the end zone of GoD
is, and half of the upper level Omens of War zones, it could be a hell of a
long time before anyone besides whats left of FoH has a realistic chance of
obtaining an epic 2.0.
