I'm retiring my second account, but having a little trouble where to
actually cancel the darned thing. I know it's a bit much to expect
them to have a big "cancel here" button begging to be pressed right on
the log in page, but I can't seem to find the option anywhere...

Anyone with recent experience know where to find it?
