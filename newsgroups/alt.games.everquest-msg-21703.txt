"Kitty Kat" does not fit any of the definitions of the word "phrase" from
the above.
(Taken from www.dictionary.com, you can do other research if you like.)
Perhaps you might stretch it to fit definition number 3 but it really isn't
an "expression",
what would it mean?

"Kitty Kat" is a compound name, not a phrase. Keep working on your English
Degree, I have mine already.
