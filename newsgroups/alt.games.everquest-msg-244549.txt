Hi All;

I've spent very little time in OS and when there usually at the "Jail" camp.
I've read several "guides" to OS and keep running into conflicting info
about the "Disco" area so I thought I would ask the veterans here.

There is a door to the "Disco" area. Some guides indicate you just click on
it and enter. Some indicate you MUST have a rogue. Some indicate there is a
key you can get somewhere, like the OS key you first get.

Could you please clarify this for me?  If a key IS used, where/how do I get
this?

Thanks in advance for your time and help.
