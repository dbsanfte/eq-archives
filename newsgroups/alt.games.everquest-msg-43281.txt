We looted another Necromancer blood from one of the Pyzjn corpses last
night.  This is the 4th blood we have gotten so far.  EQTraders hasn't been
responding in the last 24 hours and I haven't been able to find out what
this is used for from any of the other sites.  I assume some sort of armor,
but not sure which.

All I have been able to find out is that some of the other necros ( like
Tovax ) also drop the blood.

Does anyone know what this is used for?
