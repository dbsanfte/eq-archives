At 3:52 EST the servers were listed as UP.  However, I get exactly the 
same message as before when trying to log in, saying that the login 
servers are not allowing connections, likely due to a patch in progress.

Which, as you may know, irritates me no end; The server status page 
should list whether you can log in or not, and when trying to log in, it 
should be obvious whether you're just bouncing, or whether the server is 
closed.

Routine maintenance, well I don't know that that consists of, of course, 
but I really am mystified as to what could be both routine, and 
potentially twice as time consuming as previously assumed.

If its just one server with a glitch, then sure, I can certainly see 
that happening.  But all servers, simultaneously?  Sure sounds to me 
like something was changed, and the change didn't go as expected.
