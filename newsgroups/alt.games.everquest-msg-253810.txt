I do not expect the actual patch message to be longer, based on
previous messages (stealth fixes are continually applied to this game
without a word to the player base) and if you do not consider backend
changes to affect gameplay you have had your head in the sand when the
first of the DX9 changes came in.

Methinks you need to understand that the important changes in the game
are actually the backend stuff which stop people using low end graphics
cards etc.  In this case the AA changes aside from the obvious gameplay
aspects could potentially have the effect of bringing the servers to
their knees (no play till they fix it) but not a word on that.
