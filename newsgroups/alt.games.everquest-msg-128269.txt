A ranger could always have create a MELEE social like this:

/sit off
/doability 1 <forage>
/attack on
/doabiltiy 2 <direction sense>
/loc            <he will know where the fight started>

The food will be on his cursor but one can still drop it in inventory
during the fight.  


He can also create a social called BOOK:

/sit off
/doability 1 <forage>
/book
/doabiltiy 2 <direction sense>
/time           <so he won't play too late>

Again the food will be on the cursor but you can open bags whiile in
the spell book to drop the food into a bag.  That's a forage every
time he starts combat or changes spells.  BTW, since the change where
one has to stop running for the /book command to work, one can forage
while running by hitting the above suggested BOOK social.
