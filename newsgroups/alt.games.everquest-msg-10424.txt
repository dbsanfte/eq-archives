Depends on range.  If your'e standing closest to a snared mob, it will

snared mob's attention to the nuker, if he knows what he's doing with
range.

It's sutuations like these where Nullify Magic comes into it's prime.
You'd be amazed how many druids will steer clear of your camp once you
warn the zone of snare "magically" dissapearing.
