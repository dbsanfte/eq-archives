   Glad to hear that.  I learned to type in Junior high, on a
typewriter... and I think it may have been a manual.  I am
certain that they did teach us to double space after after
sentences.  I was also taught to indent the beginnings of
paragraph with exactly five spaces.  I'm no more likely to be
able to stop doing this than I am to learn some kind of
new-fangled home row.  I have to admit, it does look "wrong" to
me to not see the double space when others post, but I'm not the
sort to make a fuss over such matters.  I also like the double
spacing between paragraphs.  It does make it seem easier to read,
though as Biz points out, this is negated by long, ramble monster
paragraphs that some are inclined to churn out.  Maybe I am
exceptionally lazy, but unless the topic is one that I am
exceedingly interested in, and it is coherently written, If I am
presented with over a screen or two of uninterrupted text, I am
very likely to just move onto something less taxing.

   Not sure if any of this falls under Netiquette, though.  I
thought that word refereed more to basic politeness, a commodity
that is often is short supply.  I would that say refraining from
top-posting falls under that category, though, because IMO it is
rude to expect others to scroll past your contribution to read
the context, scroll back to read what you wrote, or sort it out
mentally.  I tend to skip over these posts also. 
 
    To the OP (Original Poster)... Thanks for asking about this! 
It's nice to see a fresh face that cares about such things.  I
hope you have a long and gratifying relationship with the rest of
the civilized elements of the Usenet community.

Annie
