Not neccesarily your system. Were parsing my trolls log file, and got 
told it couldnt parse it due to the log file containing 2 chars.

After a LONG time of searching (had name of the char that alledgedly 
were in my file, but due to Notepad not being very happy of 20+ mb 
files) i finally found out that it somehow had recorded a "Annebella (or 
whatever name were) saved" line in my log file.
NO clue to how that could happen, grouped with her for a few hours in 
CoM, but somehow my comp had recieved bad data from EQ, so my log file 
contained her save message instead.
Luckily it were just that 1 line, so could fix it easily.
