I just kind of browsed a bit. I have at least 1 of every class, but no one
above 42, so the spells I was looking for are probably well below the
interest level of most folks...

At any rate, a number of the wizard luclin ports were there, good news for
those who find it inconvenient to shop in Neriak. And I seem to recall
that some of the skyshrine-sold ports were there too. Otherwise, I didn't
see anything that leaped out at me for enchanter/necro/mage spells or bard
songs. Folks who are more dedicated to their classes might find gems I
missed.
