Ditto... same here... SoW is no problem, but sometimes a CR Port comes with
a 'Shoulda got a Bind closer to the action' lecture, which is nearly always
met with "yeah, I'll know better next time" or words to that effect :o)

I also buff newbies in Oasis/North K when I'm waiting for giants to spawn,
mana permitting... but only on a 'drive by' basis... anyone ASKING for buffs
gets a "sorry, oom" reply ;o)
