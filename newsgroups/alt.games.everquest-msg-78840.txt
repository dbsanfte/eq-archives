Well, they killed *me* twice.  :-)  At least they did until
I worked out the timings and just the right places to stand.

I made that trip several dozen times before I was finished,
so I had plenty of opportunities to let the low-likelihood
dangers catch up with me, like having Crusader Bodli walking
along the city wall towards the hills just as I was running
in to visit Trooper Mozo.

This is an excellent tip, one I wish I had read earlier before
I figured it out myself one day, shopping for HQ Cat Pelts
(while tailoring my brains out trying for skill-ups).

A much faster way to do the Qeynos clerics/paladins is the
Koalindl fish turn-in, using a disposable mule for the
actual fish-slayings.

Aegis of Life.  It took me a while to get (Paladins can use it
too), but it was worth it.


>A Dark elf iskar friend of mine

Um, could you run that one past me again?  :-)

That would be my guess.  Every race/class/religion combo
can have a different starting point with any given faction group
in the game.  And since you max out 2000 points above that
starting point, different characters can have different
max faction standings with <whomever>.  It only makes sense
that the Iksar Shamans might consider the goody-goody Paladins
(or those disgustingly short Dwarves, for all I know) to
be less desirable than some other non-Kunarkian race/class/religion
combo.

Just because a dwarf/paladin/brell character can never
get into the good graces of the Iksar Shamans, that
doesn't mean that another character type might not
be more acceptable to them with enough faction work.


>Love the pics of the dwarf standing around the iksars.. ahah

Thanks, that's one of my favorites too.  I also love
the "WTF?" expression on Crusader Bodli's face in
one of the other screenshots.

Actually, there might be a way...  I think I've figured
out an end-run on that faction quest.  If it works,
I'll likely be the first Paladin ever to be welcome
in the Neriak Cleric's guild.  (Most of the rest of
Neriak already loves me via other faction quests.)
I'll report back if I'm successful.
