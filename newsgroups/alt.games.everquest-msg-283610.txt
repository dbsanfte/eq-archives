I agree that the task system is pretty brain-dead.  They were intended
to offer something you could hope to do solo in one play session, with
rough estimates of 1-4 hours depending on whether the task is billed as
short/medium/long.  The payoffs for medium and long tasks can be as big
as a couple bubbles of xp, but the short ones usually pay only 1-2 ticks
at best.  At level 60 a short task pays just under 60pp.

As you say, the tasks may be more useful if you can double them up with
something else you were going to do.  Allakhazam's quest database has
nowhere near all the tasks listed, though they're gradually being added.
(Probably the main reason they're not being added faster is because the
tasks are so boring that people mostly aren't doing them.)

You can indeed drop the task you were doing in order to take on another.
Even better, though, you can decline all of the tasks that were offered,
and after 15 seconds you can ask again and usually get a different set
of tasks.  Depending on your level, the task master might have several
dozen tasks to offer you, or might have only 1-2 (or even none); some
tasks are offered more often than others, but if you're patient you can
often find one in the area you want to hunt in.  E.g., last night on my
way to hunt in Skyfire, I paused in OT to talk to a taskmaster, and my
two-boxers each got a task to explore and/or kill stuff in Skyfire.

As you note, though, it's hard to know where the task is really going to
send you.  You can see the first step only.  One time I took a task that
started with exploring the hornet hive in Burning Woods, only to find
that the second step required going deep into Chardok, which was out of
the question for that character.  That's the sort of thing that could be
solved by building up a database of known tasks, e.g. at Allakhazam or
wherever.

The other thing that can help make tasks acceptable is if you're NOT solo.
If two or more people have the same task, you can share all the effort
except for looting.  I.e., explore place X is handled by the group going
there, and kill N mobs is likewise satisfied for everyone by killing the
same N mobs.  It's only if you have to loot something that each person
must loot their own set of items.  However, it usually works to loot the
needed items from ANY mobs as long as you're in the required zone, so
things like plague mites and bone chips and whatnot can often be picked
up from other mobs while meeting the kill quota on the specified mobs.

In some cases you can even double up on the looting.  My two-boxers once
had two tasks each of which involved killing "gunthak swabbies" on the
northwest island of Timorous Deep.  One task called for looting fine
steel rapiers; the other for fine steel daggers.

Frankly, my biggest problem with the tasks is that the "color text" is
so STUPID.  They look very much like the old "Mad Lib" games, where you're
asked to make up some verbs, nouns, etc., that then get plugged into some
blanks to yield a ridiculous story.  E.g., one of my tasks last night had
these instructions.  The parts not in [brackets] are identical to several
others tasks I've seen.  (The parts that ARE in brackets also get re-used
in other tasks, too.)

1) The world is growing at an alarming rate and there aren't enough plots
of land available for everyone and their livestock to live in.  That's why
it's up to you to find some new plots of land.  Your first target is going
to be nearby, which is why you need to [explore the dragon mouth on the
lava flow in the west,].  You'll know once you arrive if it's a good piece
of property or not. (in Skyfire)

2) That wasn't the most hospitable place in the world, especially not for a
family, but there are plenty of other locations you can visit. This time,
why don't you [explore the tower where sarnak reside],? You're bound to get
lucky sooner or later and find a suitable living spot. (in The Overthere)

3) (Haven't gotten this far yet, but I'm sure it will involve reporting to
some NPC someplace who is "waiting for someone important to arrive".)

My other problem is that some tasks have very obscure or ambiguous
descriptions, such as exploring a "slime-covered ramp" in Lower Guk,
or something like that.  But again, that sort of thing would be okay
once people figure out the locations and share the info.
