Well after hittting 44 a couple of days ago, and going on a large raid to
kael last night, im looking for some hunting advice.

Im camped out in EW and my plan was either mammoths and cougars, or the
rygor orcs. This creates two problems:

1)
The mammoths and cougars can easily be feared and killed at my leisure with
a tiny amount of HP lost and only about 1 bub of mana per kill, so i can
without any medding go on for 4-5 mobs this way.
This is ok xp on the whole but the loot sucks (as with all animals) And its
time to start thinking about cash as i've been a little stupid with my cash
up to now.

2)
The orcs are vastly better loot, similar (sometimes better) XP but after i
have rooted and DD'd them a couple of times, im down to half mana, then i
have to go toe to toe with it (fully buffed = more med time) and that would
take me down to half HP on average.

So the question is, which would be better in your guys opioion? I want to
get to 49 as quick as possible mixing in loot with xp.

Any suggestions?

On a side note, who drops the rygor armor? I ignore the scouts as they are
light blue and not worth the effort, the centurians are going to get light
blue at 45 i think. So what drops them?

Another thing.... Harmony.... I am of the understanding that if i cast this
on a group of say 4 mobs, i can then go ahead and safely pull one of the
mobs without the other mobs even noticing me. Every time I try this it goes
wrong and i get all off them. So what the formula for success on this one?
Can it be resisted or am i doing it wrong.

Thanks for any help/sugesstion, i just want to get these levels out the way
as quickly as possible.
