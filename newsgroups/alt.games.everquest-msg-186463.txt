That's beside the point. You indicated you did not want to waste time
doing anything that wasn't achieving your numerical goals. The fact
you are unable to set those goals very high due to time constraints
doesn't matter. It is still the same mindset.

This is why the new EQ is so perfect for you, because you were quite
right when you said it isn't a rpg. Not anymore, at least, for the
majority. But thinking that this is the proper way to make all mmorpgs
now because it is popular in the current EQ - your "cater to the
playerbase" comments - is flat out wrong.

You should probably be reminded, then, that this is not a private
conversation, and others more knowledgeable about AC2 than yourself
will understand the references better.

One wonders why you play crpgs at all. They don't appear to be your
cup of tea.
