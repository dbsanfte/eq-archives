Bad, BAD idea.  This would be incredibly unbalancing.  Think about it.
If a change like this were in place you would have a class that
outdamages everybody in the short haul and yet can still outdamage
very nearly everybody in the long haul.  There's no way in hell that
it makes sense for a class that already totally outclasses everybody in
the ability to reliably crank out large amounts of damage over a short
period of time to also rank with the top sustained damage output
classes.  A Wizard has no business even coming close to a Warrior's
sustained damage output, let alone exceeding it as you are proposing.

This way you create a class that is utterly dominant, rendering every
other class useless except in the small numbers necessary to support
the Wizards.  Bad idea.  Very BAD idea.
