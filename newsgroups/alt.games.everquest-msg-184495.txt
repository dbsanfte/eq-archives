You can "get by" with only one weapon skill.


But then what happens should you get a bit farther on, and learn that with a
piercing skill of 0, you have a chance to be given this...


Greatstaff of Misery:  Dmg 45, Dly 35. Wt 10.00. +25 AC, +12 Sta, +8 Dex,
+13 Wis, +13 Int, +20 vsMg, +100 HP, +125 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of

... or any of the other weapons at the bottom of this list.

Or you had zero two hand blunt skill, and ended up being allowed the chance
to loot this.....

Resplendent War Maul:  Dmg 51, Dly 37. Wt 3.00. +12 Sta, +18 Agi, +15 Wis,
+20 vsFire, +20 vsCold, +120 HP, +100 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP Effect of

....  or any of the other weapons at the bottom of this list.

What would you say then?   "No thanks, I'll keep my "so-so" one hander,
which doesn't do have as much damage, or have nearly as good a proc effect.
It's good enough for me, and it's too much of a hastle to raise that skill.

More likely if anyone found out that your skill with those weapons was zero,
they would pass you over for them and give it to a paladin that didn't slack
quite so much.... ; )
