My current EQ installation is on my D:, an IBM 75GB drive. I want to move it 
over to my new C:, a WD 120GB drive w/ 8MB cache. I've read that EQ is pretty 
much self-contained in it's folder. Can I just move the entire directory over 
to the new drive? Or should I copy the current directory's contents, do an 
uninstall, reinstall on the new drive, then overwrite the new install with my 
old contents?

Thanks.
