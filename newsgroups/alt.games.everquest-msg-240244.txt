Irrelevant,. If the video rental store is losing money that doesn't
make it ok to for it to start violating copyright....profitability is
simply not a factor.

I know of no-one who can comfortably seat 100 people in their living
room. However if you happen to be able to seat 100 people in yours and
have 100 friends, then your fine. 

Although with a 100 people the chipped in money would only trivially
be covering the movies, and the vast majority would be covering the
refreshments ;)

It certainly does, broadcasting and reproduction are expressly
protected by copyright. That is why it says its intended for home
viewing only. To alert you that you have not been granted public
broadcast & duplication rights ...  rights specifically protected by
copyright.  It makes no mention of your right to cut it into small
peices and burn it even though you do have that right. Copyright
doesn't prevent buring of copyrighted works, so there is no need to
grant you express permission to do it, and no point to try to tell you
you can't ... because you can.

Similiarly I'm asserting copyright doesn't protect moving in game
items around between paying subscribers. Even if copyright does apply
to EQ plat the transferring of it between subscribers to Everquest is
not a protected right.

Suppose I'm at the video store holding a store copy of Last Action
Hero.... its not my movie, I don't own the rights to it; I don't even
own the copy of it. Now suppose its the last copy in and you REALLY
want to rent it, and you offer me 5 bucks  for it, so you can rent
it...  is that a *copyright violation*??

I think that is a reach... a loooong reach.
