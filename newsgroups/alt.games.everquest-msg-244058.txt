to talk in general chat channels you use the ";"

IE, if you joined serverwide.age:age ------
; Hey everyone, how are you

Would send the message to it

If you've joined more than one channel then ";" all by itself 
goes to channel number 1.  The other channels are accessed by ";#"

IE, if you type /join serverwide.Magicians:fluffy after joining
Serverwide.age:age then you type

;2 Hi magicians, how's things?

If you aren't sure what channels you're in type ;list
If you want to know who's in a channel type ;list # (where # is the 
number of the channel you want)

IE, if you haven't changed your channels from the above, ;list 2 will
tell you who is signed into the mage channel.

Finally, you can type ;leave # to get out of a channel.  ;leaveall will
get out of all channels.  Note, when you leave a channel that isn't the
last channel, the higher numbered channels will all drop back.

IE if you are in serverwide.age on channel 1, serverwide.magicians on
channel 2 and type ;leave 1, serverwide.magicians will now be channel 
1 and serverwide.age is gone

So 
; talks in the first channel
;# talks in channel #
;list lists all channels
;list # list who's in channel #
;leave # removes that channel # from the list
;leaveall removes all of them
