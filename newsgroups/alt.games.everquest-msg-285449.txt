	What's the point of undercons?  If a mob has twice as many
hitpoints as the other mobs of it's level and hits 3 times as hard
why is it not a higher level mob?  I'm especially thinking of some
of the semi-named mobs in the new zones (mobs that have "special"
names like "cunning puma" but which don't have drops).
