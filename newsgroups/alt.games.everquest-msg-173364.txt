The newbie yard on E and W Freeport, then move out to the East commons
and/or North Ro. At that level thats all you will handle close to
Freeport.

Type /lfg on and let people ask you. Say once on the ooc channel Lvl N
cleric LFG and let them come to you.

At lvl 5 it'll be rare to find any groups, though...experienced players
are rapidly levelling solo and others are learning still. As a cleric
though you may find yourself popular. If you do join a group, get your
heal, cure disease and poison if you have them and stun and DD loaded into
your gems. Then sit on your butt medding and stand to cast heals on the
main fighter. Use the other cures as an emergency measure if suh a mob
appears. If things are going well then consider stunning or DD ing a mob.

Not a lot unless a message comes in which can lock you up some while it
processes in the background....I turn my ICQ off.
