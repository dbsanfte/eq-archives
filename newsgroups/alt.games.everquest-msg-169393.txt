Well, after a bit of effort (had to train to NFP zone, then come back and
root/pacification/atone some guards) I was able to buy the purification tablets in
Freeport, which I thought would be the hard part.

Then I picked the next most difficult, which is a barrel of beer at Crow's in
Qeynos.  Sadly, Crow won't sell to me.  I suppose I could do faction work to fix
that, or arrange a charm for him... but I'm not quite that interested.
