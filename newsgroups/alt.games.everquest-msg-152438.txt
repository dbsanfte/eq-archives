The consignment shop approach could be implemented outside of
the merchant code much like the trader code is.  I envision
getting a window similar to what you get when you type /bazaar.

In addition, I said the consignment shop traders can be linked
like the bankers are.  One stop shopping.

But Verant probably DOES care about their bandwidth and server

server costs.

You're assuming the consignment shop approach would need to be
shoehorned into the traditional merchant code.  That is not the
case.

Having a bazaar *at all* is certainly better than having nothing.
However, the consignment shop approach seems far superior.
