Since leaving Burtoxx server going on a year ago (real bad CS experineces
there), I've had great experience with the customer service folks on Povar.
I've only had 1 CS rez from Povar but I've had a few incidents where I've
needed help (body was "sliding" when died and slid under a hill, sinking
under the world, etc...).

Burtoxx server...  I was on there when it was new.  Quit for a couple years
due to work related travel and came back to start a char there.  Ran into a
few bugs and got some real bad service from the CS folks there (took 2
petitions to get my body out of a wall one day.  first guy said you should
be able to /corpse pull it from where it is. second guy got it for me an
hour later AFTER a bard had helped me FIND it in the wall -- FROM a full
CAMP).

I wouldn't go back to that server for anything with my experiences there so,
it can be as server dependant as situational for your service.
