Hmmm. Let's see.  You who play in an interactive cartoon, and you
characterize yourself in cartoonish fashion in your sig, yet you
(1) insult those who refer to their characters as "toons", and
(2) resent being told that I find your choice of language absurdly
out of line for the context, and
(3) whine that I didn't reply soon enough to your hypocritcal post,
(4) post a gratuitous juvenile insult because _you_ believe that
my delayed post is a troll?

You ought to try a more honest tag to your sig, perhaps:
"Dark Tyger -- A self-righteous hypocritical buffoon"
