On KB, I hunt there quite often in search for pieces of the Illusion:Iksar
spell quest. I sell the spell to chanters.
It is almost always empty on KB which I find to be very sad. I raised my
shaman on Bristlebane there
many moons ago. Oasis is also an empty spot now, way too risky for a level
12 to visit - no one is there
to control the mobs anymore.  Because the epic quests haven't been changed
by POP and Luclin, my
guild on KB has recently rediscovered Kunark and Velious and I can't wait to
hunt in CT for tailoring
skill ups. I wonder if any one else will be there?
