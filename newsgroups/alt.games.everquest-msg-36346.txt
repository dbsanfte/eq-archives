Nope. I know the way by heart and still got killed with a low level
character from both directions. Since it was a level 8 ranger, I don't think
their results would vary that much. It is my *much* preferred route for my
characters with some form of invis or SoW. The agnostic enc did not get
killed, but only because I dropped invis a good distance from anything. The
enc was level 4 with invis and as I stated, the best way to handle travel in
that area.

This is different from the point you challenged me on anyway. I thought it
was your position that the ranger would not be KOS in Runneye without having
previously killed some gobbies. Now you seem to be saying ~You are KOS, but
it is OK.

I assume we are both on the same page now, most likely a ranger/Karana<?>
will KOS in both the Gorge and Runnyeye.

The fall did not kill the ranger and the Mino did not go agresso when he was
on the ground level. Mino went agresso after climbed up to the top of the
wall and was resting.
