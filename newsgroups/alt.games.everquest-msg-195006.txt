Since the second cudgel didn't seem possible to solo at 10, I went into Kurns to
level up a bit.

Paladul didn't seem any faster than Kurns, by the way, do people not remember
this sweet exping spot anymore?  My cleric leveled up thru his teens here, once
upon a time and well before Paladul.

Wandering around with a 14 SK and a 10 cleric having fun, the cleric and I were
11 by the time the SK went LD.  So we sat tight and guarded his spawn site, which
turns out by chance to be the Crusader spot as well.  Nice to see that relatively
untwinked shaman plus cleric could take down a red con mob like that, although to
be fair he -is- undead so the cleric was a better punch than usual.

Crusader dropped "skull with an X" which I recalled as a rare drop needed for
cudgel 3

Anyway we killed him a second time (along with quite a few other mobs and both
dinging 12) before the SK got back, and he dropped the same skull.  Skull wasn't
lore, so I took it as well, but I'm a bit confused now.  I thought he dropped a
common skull I needed several of, and a rare one "with an X" that I need one of.
Do I now have 2 of the "rare" and none of the "common"?  Or is the rare one the
same name but lore... I thought the rare one was lore and was surprised when I
could hold two.

Suppose I should just look it up.  Anyway, I thought it was funny that the drop
for cudgel three was just falling into my hands while I was unable to even think
about getting any of the drops for cudgel two!

Forssake
