And hence why some of us have been pointing out that the good druids
are quite capable of covering heals. You're describing an idiot above.

Problem with having a shaman as main healer is that the times when you
really need a heal NOW are also the times when a shaman needs to be
slowing. There have been times when I probably covered 80% of the
healing with Quiessence but the druid was still the main healer, he
was responsible for healing when the shit hit the fan and I was too
busy doing other things.
