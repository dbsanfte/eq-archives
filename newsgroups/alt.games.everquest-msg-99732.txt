I'm not a fan of GEBs although I admit they might set off your robe
nicely. Have you ever considered coldain skin boots and gloves (dark,
dark brown leather)? I wore gnome skin boots till I got coldain skin,
and gnome skin gloves till I got gloves of the earthcrafter. I am also
wearing gnome tunic and legs, nathsar sleeves and woven grass bracer
with elaborate scimitar and sarnak battle shield. The nathsar sleeves
clash horribly with everything else, so I hope to get woven grass
sleeves soon.

When I tried tinting, the only result was that my forest green bracer
looked sea green. I am going to play with luclin models turned on and
tinting turned off tonight and see if the color is still messed up.
Also, guildies who have gotten tinting to work have confirmed that my
gnomeskin outfit has been turned into some kind of dominatrix
streetwalker lederhosen thing. My plans are now to get a hold of a
pair of black chitin leggings and buy an imbued elven chainmail tunic
while I wait for my chances at the really good chain armor to pan out.
