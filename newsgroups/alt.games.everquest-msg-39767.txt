The highland kobolds make a good place for 26-30, plus they drop etched iron
and FS weapons. We hunted at one in a corner of the zone at +4000 +3000 and
did rather well. we had levels 24-29 represented. The highlands are just
like their little cousins, except for better loot and the shamans have some
nasty AOE spells.
