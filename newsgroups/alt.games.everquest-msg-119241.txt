Pets

1) Is there any chance that in the future the experience penalty for a
pet doing over 50% of the damage while soloing to any monster will be
removed? -Ghalon Soulburn

A) There's always a chance. Again, we'll look at that as well when we
review casters. However, remember that whatever 'soloing ability'
Mages have now (whether considered great or average) would be
dramatically increased if pets suddenly stopped earning experience for
all of their hard work and sacrifice.

2) How much experience does a pet take from a group is it still 1% on
average (Various player tests have indicted that a pet takes the same
amount of experience as a player)? &#8211;Ascii

A) A pet will take a fair share of the experience (as if it was an
additional party member) IF the pet does more damage than all other
group members (individually). If any party member outdamages the pet,
the pet only takes 1% of the experience.

Afterward, he backpeddled a bit with this correction:
