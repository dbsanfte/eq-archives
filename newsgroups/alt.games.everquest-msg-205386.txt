The All Access Pass covers the Mac version of EQ as well. You can't
access more than one of Sony's games without paying a separate fee for
it, unfortunately. It does save a few dollars and also covers EQII when
it releases, as well as Planetside. I'm sitting behind a proxy server
that won't let me access Sony's site, so I can't tell you whether or
not it also covers Galaxies. Originally it didn't, but someone recently
told me that it did.
