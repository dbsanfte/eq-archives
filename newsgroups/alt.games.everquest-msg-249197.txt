Ok then, been playing EQ for about 5 days or so now, but just for a few
hours here and there. I've got a level 5 Froglok on the English server
(forgot it's name now...starts with a 'V') and also a Wizard on Stromm. Now
I know I haven't been playing long and I'm probably in the wrong places, but
I expected to see more than 2 players in my time in the game. And I only saw
them for a matter of about 2 seconds.

Am I just in the wrong areas to be finding people (starting cities and the
areas around them) or is this just the way it is? At the moment it feels
like im playing on my own and that kinda removes the whole point of a
MMOPRG. It's like playing Morrowind.

I know the wheels go round and round, but whats the story prior to that
movement?
