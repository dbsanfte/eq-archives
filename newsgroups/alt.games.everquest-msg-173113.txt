Anyone who would put their trust in the US government not to waste their
sacrifice is going to be looked down upon by me, no matter what you say.

Nope...they give it to them.

I really couldnt give a rats ass what the politicians are saying, or who is
making the decision to go to war in Iraq.

The US is a "rogue nation" itself. It is far too powerful and is a
destabilising force in the world. The war on Iraq is a case in point.

Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.
You only link the two because you are told you should.
Get a brain.

Well...you havent managed to get him out yet...whats holding you up?
Last time you went in and bombed the fuck out of his people, and left him
there, which was followed by years of sanctions which killed more innocent
people but left him in power.
Before that you were GIVING him presents of military equipment!!!
Dont give me your mealy-mouthed "saviours of the world" tripe, it is
bullshit.
