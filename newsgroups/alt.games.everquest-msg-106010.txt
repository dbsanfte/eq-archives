Hi All,

Got my Iksar Beastlord to level 51 the other night, and now I get the
AAXP percent choice. I have asked several other players what is a good
setting for the percentage, or should I wait (as many suggested) till
54 to start these? What are the advantages/disadvantages to waiting
till 54 (which is already a hell level, why make it worse?).

Also starting to notice that skills that were once frozen are not
moving up again. Meditate which stopped at 185, Block which stopped at
125, etc are all moving up! So I dont rely 100% on my pet, and I get
in and melee too from time to time.

I have been soloing so far in Burning Wood (some), Dreadlands
(mostly), and Emerald Jungle (some), and grouping in Karnors which I
hate. Karnors tends to be Grand Central Station with trains departing
on a regular schedule, unless you get a really good group in the RCY,
or LCY. In the Dreadlands I am starting to see more and more light
blue cons then before, even some of the Ragers are.
And I need at least 75% mana to take on a Ravishing Drol.

Where else is good to be either soloing or with a group? Keep in mind
that as a Beastlord I can heal myself, and my pet, I have SOW, and
some decent self buffs, and mob debuffs, and also have invis as I am
an Iksar and KOS everywhere but the moon. I have about 1400 hps
compared to my pets 2000+ hps, so tend to let the pet do most of the
fighting.

Thanks,

Geckool (51st Season Iksar Beastlord, Quellious)
