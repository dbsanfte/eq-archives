Ah..  its not very often that I do Frenzied (i really dislike Velk, I only
go there cuz i can solo.. if i had to group id go back to sebilis/anywhere
but velk) so when I look at the sentinels, theres that ice wall that stops
shurikens etc going though.  I guess FF is above the level of the wall...
hmm interesting to know, thanks.

Theres a monk on my server with a bad rep, hes a best friend of one of my
r/l friends on line, so a mutual friend of mine (tho my guild hates him)..
its funny to be playing with him, in say the karnors lil cubby hole.. then
hear everybody from Hands to the basement yell "f%45cking training as usual,
u pos monk!!!!!"  even tho he never left me sight lol.
