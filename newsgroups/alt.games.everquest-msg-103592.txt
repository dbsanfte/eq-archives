Couldn't have said it better myself. And, yes, one can become "Uberest
of the ubers" even if they are stupid and arrogant. All it takes is
recruiting a shitload of high levels with the promise of political
power on the server, phat l3wt, and respect of star-struck sheep who
think that being uber is all that counts.

Yeah, they can plan an impressive raid and carry it out smoothly, but
that doesn't mean they aren't still a bunch of stuck-up, obnoxious
idiots.
