Hiding the boy's age from guildies is a very bad thing.  I have no problems 
with playing with the 14 yr old in my guild, he's a mature young man and 
has been no trouble.  OTOH, some 15 yr olds and older people I know are 
very immature and I'd rather throw them off a cliff than help them in EQ.

Knowing up front that you are playing with a child will keep a handle on 
some the trash talking I hear sometimes.  Not that every kid will shrivel 
up and die from hearing a few cuss words but seriously, no parent wants 
thier kid to be on the recieving end of some the things I've heard people 
say, and not just in Teamspeak, OOC is downright filthy sometimes.

To the OP:  It's great that you want to share something with your 7 yr old.  
Personally, I think 7 is a might young but if he has a 6th grader's 
mentality, then the stimulation might actually be good for him.  I wouldn't 
allow him to play alone under any circumstances.  Even if it's just for a 
few hours while you are at work.  There are perverts who target kids in EQ, 
gotta keep him safe from them.  Teach him that sometimes you have bad days 
ingame.  I know I've had crying fits from those bad days, G-d only knows 
how I would have reacted at a much younger age.  Don't let EQ become more 
important than anything else in his life.
