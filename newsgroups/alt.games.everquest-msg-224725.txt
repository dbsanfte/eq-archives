The best plan I've seen is to have not one, but Two messages; one says 
"pulling %t" and the second says "Kill the %t now".

First message gives us a heads up as to whats coming, and we can assist 
to pick the target out.  But the key is to not engage until the second 
message, when the MT has the mob where he wants it and is sure he has 
its attention.  I'll do malaise on the pull message (its very low 
aggro), but won't sent pet or think about nuking till the kill 
message... in fact depending on the group I may wait till 90% or less on 
the mob HP bar before nuking.

This is raid style thinking, but it applies well to small group 
operations; yes, its possible to get by without it, but every little bit 
helps (the theme of this thread is, after all, the little things), and 
its good training for your MA and puller and for everyone else.

In a raid guild I was in long ago, the MA on more than one occaision 
sent my cleric a tell saying he was going to tank the next pull solo, so 
be ready for extra healing effort.  Then he'd pull in a mob and NOT call 
for assist, tank it start to finish all by himself (with me pushing 
heals out like crazy of course).  If anyone hit the mob or cast anything 
with any potential to get aggro, they'd hear about it, because he hadn't 
called assist yet.

This sort of discipline was critical later in taking out mobs that have 
Rampage lists or where positioning was crucial... but it was always 
helpful and effective in the run of the mill, improving the odds that 
the mob would stay on the MA, and allowing melee and pet handlers to 
gain the benefit of getting out of the front arc of the mobs; for those 
reasons its just as nice to have in a small group.
