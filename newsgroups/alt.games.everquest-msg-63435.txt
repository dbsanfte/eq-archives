Excellent example. Five members of one of the NFL teams (can't remember
which one, sorry) came on the field a couple weeks ago and had decided
to wear socks that came up to their knees, rather than the regulation
height. Far from being as blatant as the indian headress example, but
they were given fines in the *thousands* of dollars. ESPN made quite a
big deal about it.
