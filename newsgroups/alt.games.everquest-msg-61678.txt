ACK!!!..you're shopping in the wrong place....try www.pricewatch.com when
looking for a "reference" price...

I saw a guy in another thread got a Geforce3 for like $90 in some sale at
Best Buy....so shop around some more..


$138  -  GeForce3 TI
$85  -  GeForce2 TI
$90  GeForce2 Pro 64MB
$52  -  GeForce2 MX400 64MB
$54  -  GeForce2 MX400 32MB
$42  -  GeForce2 MX200 64MB
$36  -  GeForce2 MX200 32MB
$90  GeForce2 GTS 64MB
$62  -  GeForce2 GTS 32MB


> CDW GeForce2MX 400 (64) about $85 at CDW...less than half the cost.
