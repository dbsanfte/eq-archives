If the rotations were not well established and respected, I would advocate
we just went ahead as the alliance and took the mobs when we wanted.  This
is a rotation that has been in effect for something like 2 years now, and
the ones who chose to destroy it would likely be looked upon less than
kindly.  I do agree that a pickup slot should be added to the Trak rotation,
so that it is like the VS one, and does allow for other than a single guild
taking the mob at times.
