The SK is Duriek Bloodpool.  He used to be KoS to all except evil Erudites.
Seems he is only on the True Spirit faction, now.  He also had a huge aggro
range (like that squirt in the blue bldg in NFpt that aggros through the
door).  He normally stays upstairs near Azzar Habib, but sometimes wanders
down to the tunnel between the newbie area and the exit to the city/Toxx.
