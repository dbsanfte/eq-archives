Hi, I don't know how my game works.

You can't get over 30 aa points. Once you have 30 aa points you cannot
gain any more AAXP according to a few guildies with 30 saved up. You
actually get a specific message to that effect once you hit 30 saved AA.

Still useless.

Hard to see any changes yet. Will have to see some indepth parses.
Endgame monks in my guild were reporting no noticable changes, and were
warriors, but it was only anecdotal.

Agreed there, but maybe that's the only way to reliably reduce damage
taken over time. I too would much rather get hit with greater
mitigation, than with more avoidance. But I'll take what I can get.

WHat were the caps before? I think of rangers as the highest chain
mitigation class, so unless this is a huge hike, I dont really see a
problem with it.

Snipped mage vasectomy.

I think a few patches back made it possible to stack focus with str/dex?
They probably changed it back to one overwriting the other.

Who knows...

Icon based small mana regen spell from certain rightclicks (Acrylia,
Akheva, etc). Because it's spell based, it doesn't count towards the FT
latent cap.

220k now I hear. For the safety net of having a few monks with res after
a wipeout, we'll probably have to mount twink vox raids now. Should've
made the recharge ~30-50k, so it's only used in emergencies, but still
not worth the time to farm vox. 220k is a little too far to make it
viable IMO.

Once you get to L60, the warrior doesn't rely on taunt, the other people
rely on not overtaking the warrior on the hate list. Any worthwhile
changes to high level taunt would make most endgame fights totally
trivial unfortunately. 

The way to 'fix' warriors for both taunt and dps in the high level game
would simply be to add a DD componant to EB, and throw in more variety
of weapons with EB. No other class in the endgame is restricted to 3
weapons across 2 slots in the entire high level game, inferior to
Velious level weapons in terms of DPS.
