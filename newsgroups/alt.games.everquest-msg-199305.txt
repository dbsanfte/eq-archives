I'm sure everyone has a list of NPCs they level up to get revenge on.
Let's see, doubt if this will be comprehensive: Dorn B'Dynn, the DE in 
Nro at the bandit camp, Equestrielle the aforementioned horse, the DE 
guards at the entrance to Neriak because a young woodelf didn't know 
about things like factions and decided to go visit one day, the iksar at 
the base of the statue in FV(he's gotten me 3 times), hmm, can't 
remember any more right this second.
