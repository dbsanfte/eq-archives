The problem with this is that people often guilds.  You get that Shaman
through that trial, and then some guild that is at the later content
recruits him.  It's very easy to end up in a situation where there are
several tiers of guilds, with each guild basically serving as a flagging
factory for the tier above.

People just don't like, in general, to put in a lot of work to get something
for a character (e.g., a flag for that Shaman) that won't be useful to the
guild for a long time, and then only if that player is still in the guild.
There are exceptions, of course.  Sometimes people get to be good enough
friends in game that they'll do that sort of thing for someone just to help
them.
