That's exactly the point. The OP had been camping Hadden. Then he left.
Camp over. Then he came back. There's a wizard there. The wizard may
have been there for four hours, or he may still be hearing the leaves

He got there first. Now it's his camp, PnP whiners like the original
poster aside, that is.
