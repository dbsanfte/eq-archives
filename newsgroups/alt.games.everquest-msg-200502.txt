It's far easier to leave someone to their own devices than speak up for 
what you feel is right, knowing you may get flamed for it.

So you ran into a jerk. The only thing that can be deduced from that 
would be a broad generalization.

I tried DAoC for one evening. Didn't like it.

"Always" and "never" will take the wind out of the sails of your opinions 
in no time. Changes that improve the game for some will usually be a 
detriment to others. Do you suggest not making any changes for this 
reason? I understand different people enjoy different things. I just feel 
that KEI in it's current implementation is degrading the game. It is like 
any habit forming thing. Often times even people who enjoy it don't 
realize that it's taking something away from them without their realizing 
it.
