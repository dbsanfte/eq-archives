I am with you on that one, for purely selfish, capitalistic reasons. ;-) All 
the crafters I know were eager to see this system come online and I remained 
the lone voice of opposition warning them what it would do to their 
business. Now that it's here and there's actual price competition, prices 
have already plummeted and they're all bitching and moaning about how easy 
it is for new crafters to come in and "undercut" the "standard pricing". 
It's all I can do to withhold my "told ya so", chuckle.
