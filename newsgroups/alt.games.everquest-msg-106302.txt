Wow!  I hit F10 and now everything looks super crisp and clean at 1600x1200.  Much
improved over the first iteration!  Only problem is now my windows are all screwed up.
So how do I move them around?  Is this an ini file thing or is there an easier way?
Also, where do I set these defaults?  There's no mention of them in the manual nor can
I find the field in any of the options submenus.

Many thanks!
