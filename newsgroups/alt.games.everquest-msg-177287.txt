Gameplay issues
----------------

- Switched the spell effects of Spirit of Wolf and Snare.  We did this just
for kicks.

- Mobs below lvl 20 will now randomly Death Touch as Kerafyrm when being
hunted by any character who is 20 or more levels higher than the mobs.  Farm
silks at your own risk.

- Any melee class now has a percent chance of fumbling their attack (treat
as rolling a 1 on a d20 for all of you D&D players out there). When this
occurs, the attack goes awry and the melee in question will dismember some
extremity. It is possible for the melee to completely disable themselves
should a dual wield/double attack be completely fumbled.

Dismembered body parts can be recovered by taking the severed limbs to a
cleric and saying the phrase, "'Tis merely a flesh wound".

- Bards now have a new Alternated Advancement skill, Build Mosh Pit. When a
bard builds a mosh pit, mobs will all jump in and beat themselves to death
while the bard twists.

- Soulbinders have been searching the logs and will now remember any
character who used their brethern for skill-up practice before we got ~that~
little bug fixed. We'd recommend great care be used if you were one of the
ones who whacked Soulbinders to bits to get your 2H Slashing skill up. "Bind
your soul? Oh yeah, I'll bind your soul, all right ....... "

- Druids now run all of Norrath from Rivervale. Your worst nightmare has
come true ... it's now truly the druid's world, you're all just living in
it.
