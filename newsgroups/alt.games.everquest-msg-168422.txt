No, he refered to the typical Limbaugh fan.  The mere fact that you
"happen to disagree with him a lot" makes you atypical.  Beyond that,
I know a number of very conservative folks who dislike Limbaugh for
exactly the same reason I do.  Of course, they're a lot harder on
"liberal" populists and mostly just ignore Limbaugh.  But, regardless,
I don't see an equality between "anyone with a conservative viewpoint"
and typical Limbaugh fans.  And I share newshound's view of typical
Limbaugh fans, who come off as approximately as free thinking as, say,
typical Wellstone fans.

The "conservative movement" is not identical to "conservatives".


> rule out the possiblity of communism being called conservative.  Sorry, you


Ah yes, that's the difference between "us" and "them".  Namely that we
are "us" and they are "them".  These were conservative goverments of
conservative societies.  The American "conservative movement" is, of
course, far more liberal than they are since it works from a much more
liberal baseline.  Those societies do not enshrine personal liberty as
a social/political ideal, in fact they treat it (rightly) as a threat
to the existing social order, which makes the "left"'s infatuation with
communism in the first half of the twentieth century astonishingly
bizarre to my mind.

Oh, and as for National Socialism, in practice it bore a striking
resemblence to American (and British, and French, and Spanaish,
and ...) conservatism.  The key element of our society that protects
us from that particular extreme is the strong thread of libertarianism
running through our culture.  And the libertarian ideal is not "owned"
by either the left or the right, it is a crucial part of our common
heritage that (so far at least) has "immunized" us against a variety
of extremes from both the left and the right.

Free markets are not inherently conservative.

Nah, communism is statism taken to its illogical extreme while anarchy
is libertarianism taken to its illogical extreme.  And I would point
out that either the left or the right can reach both of those positions
at their respective fringes.

What?  You want to go and ruin a perfectly good argument?
