All I know about it is that it had that color and the word
'apprentice' was in the name. Maybe it's a Freeport newbie quest.
Maybe it's an oddball Luclin drop. But it was neon green in the
deepest sense of the word.

Blah. http://home.tiscali.no/~celaeno/sparklies.jpg is the closest
you'll ever get.
(Harmony leather is the closest thing a druid gets to neon green, and
the odds of getting a piece of that are pretty slim, especially given
my schedule)

The little pic with the red cross on it is after the change. Hated it.
Totally ruined the catsuit look and made me look like a trashy
dominatrix instead.
