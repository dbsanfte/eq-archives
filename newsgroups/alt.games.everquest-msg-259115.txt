If you're paying that much money you would probably want to consider other 
upgrade ideas such as your motherboard, processor or the type of RAM you 
use. Putting a top-notch graphics card into an old machine can cause 
bottle-necks which would lower the performance of the card especially if it 
is forced to run at 4x. There's no point getting the greatest card out if 
you're not going to get the full benefit of it, it's just a waste of money 
:)

IMO it would be better to get a cheaper graphics card and upgrade your other 
components so they are more in line with the current spec. A lot of people 
are daunted with the idea of upgrading their motherboard and CPU themselves 
but it is quite straight forward and there is lots of advice online to help 
you if you're unsure.
