Hi all, 
I have a Level 24/25 Dwarf Cleric who's equipment sucks.
I have a few low end wis items, but generally my armour is bad.
I wear mostly banded with a few extras.
This is mainly due to the facts that :

1) I never get much cash
2) I like to wear what I find.
3) I've not really camped anything yet
4) All the quests that I have done have netted me poor rewards.

What I am looking for is advice on where to hunt so that I can get some
xp and some better equipment or suggesgions on good quests that a mid
level cleric can do. The guys that I group with are a couple of levels
higher than me if that helps.
What I don't want to do is farm Giants for pp then buy stuff in EC FP.
Any suggestiong on what equipmet I should have would be usefull too.

Thanks in advance.
