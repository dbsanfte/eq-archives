Tell the story to the guild leader and officers responsible for 
recruiting.  Then let them handle it, either by dropping her or 
confronting her.  If your guild leadership is worth anything, they 
will handle it appropriately.  But DON'T just forget it happened.  If 
this person turns out to be trash and gets into your guild, you'd have 
yourself to blame.
