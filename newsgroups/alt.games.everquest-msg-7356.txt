I have no problem with schizophrenia. I *do* still have a problem with
Verants mind control rays though - and I *do* still have problems keeping
this foil hat on. I used to have problems with my family members reporting
my activities to VI as well, but ever since I moved them to the freezer all
those subversive activities ceased (it was a tight fit but that is what
woodchippers are for).
