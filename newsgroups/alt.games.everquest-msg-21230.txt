Wha? Vampiric embrace is a melee proc spell - it gives your attacks a
chance to proc a lifespike, as if you had a weapon that proc'd. As such,
you *the necro*, not your pet, have to be meleeing something to see any
benefit, and even then it might not go off. This is one for the back of
the spellbook when you've gained a couple of levels after you get it.

It's not a DoT.

You're thinking of stuff like Leach, which is a lifetap DoT.

To quote castersrealm on Vampiric Embrace:

This spell is not as useful to a necromancer as it is to a shadow
knight. This spell is self only and allows you to randomly cast a
lifetap spell while in melee. As a caster you would want to avoid melee
at all costs, so it this is not very useful for a caster. However,
vampiric embrace is not capped and goes up about 1 point every level
which is different from the shadow knights vampiric embrace which goes
up 1 every 2 levels.
