I've been killing one set of mobs that are probably mid-40s because they are reputed to drop spells,
and I'd like to start getting drops for my druid.  And in fact, I have gotten two dropped spells, but
they were the same one, a mid-30s cleric spell. 

This seems pretty weird.  I had assumed that spell drops were distributed randomly.  Do certain
mobs only drop certain spells?  If I want low-50s druid spells, are there certain mobs I should be
going after?
