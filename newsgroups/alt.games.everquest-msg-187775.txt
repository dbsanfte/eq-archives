hmmm... just a little of my logic thown in: 
Do you drink tap water?  I dont... If I dont have to.  I have a water
filter on my tap because I like clean clear water.  But I am not smart
enough to use the already made tap water... That is because I prefer a
better tasting water for myself and cleaner water for my childeren.

I supose you woulnt use Microsoft Word... since you have notepad
installed on your machine... or wordpad if you will.

Just because its there doesnt mean you should accept it as the
smartest thing to use.

Not saying your Wrong in your choice of what to use.. Im saying your
logic in your choice is wrong...
