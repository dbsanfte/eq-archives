One way to get exp and faction for turning in Berserker braids involves 2
people. one non kos. the other kos. you group. have the kos person stand
outside the outpost wall opposite where Captain Rottgrime is. The non kos
person does the hand in. you both get faction and exp. rinse and repeat
until kos person is dubious. then you can hand in braids until you get as
much factions as you wish.
