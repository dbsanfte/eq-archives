That is assuming you think a choice when it comes to PVP is the major reason
for Verants success with EQ.  Based on the follow-up posts on this thread,
you have a lot of support but I still wouldn't believe the majority hold
that viewpoint.  I would say that EQ catapulted to success so quickly
because of a lack of something better.  You have to admit that one of the
major drawing points for casual gamers is graphics and this is where I think
EQ initially took off.  People were wow'd by the game world and had
previously seen nothing like it.  Most people think it was a big step up
from UO (I personally prefer UO's graphics) and so they made the switch or
jumped into the MMORPG market for the first time.  By the time AC came out,
people were just trapped in EQ mode and didn't want to take the time to
start all over again, not to mention the graphics pale in comparison so EQ
continued to attract more of the "kewl dewd" type.  This is obvious by
lurking around EQ/AC newsgroups and message boards on the net... you
generally find a much more mature playerbase in Asherons Call (with the
exception of this newsgroup because it is pretty mature and well-managed
:)).  Of course, EQ also has many more players so you might be able to blame
it on that.

I seriously do not believe that the ability to hide from pvp is a major draw
for EQ and something that will keep most players.  Even if the next
generation of MMORPG's were the worst games ever and paled horribly in
comparison to EQ, I think they will succeed simply because they look nicer
and that is what the casual gamer wants.  Sure, you might say people will
not be willing to give up characters they took years to make but I am also
sure a large percentage of those are bored with the game mechanics anyway,
sick of the high-end game or do not wish to start over with new characters
on the same old game.  There are MANY factors to be taken into
consideration.  To compare this to the FPS genre... Quake 3 was far inferior
to Quake 2 and couldn't even hold a candle to it but it sucked away most of
the playerbase.  I think the same will hold true with the next generation of
MMORPG's regardless of how bad or good they are.  Especially since the MAIN
drawing factor of MMORPG's is friends.  I've only played EQ for 2 months and
the game is already boring as hell at least 75% of the time. ;)  If it was
not for friends made and stuff, I would have quit it already but I have met
some great people and it keeps me going.  From all I've read, this seems to
hold true for a good amount of players who only like and continue to play
the game because of friends.  I know this is why I continued to play The
Realm and Ultima Online long after I was sick with the games.  With friends
and guilds leaving to try out the new games, the community they have built
and developed will surely follow eventually.

I do agree with saying a lot of people do not like PvP at the moment and it
will probably take a number of years for that to change.  But as each new
MMORPG comes out, you will see less and less change and more of the same.
The second, third, fourth, etc generations surely will not be as
groundbreaking and dramatic as the first was.  I am sure many of them will
borrow the same basic format, interface and gameplay.  People call AO, DAOC,
etc. clones of EQ... and that is true in some respects and will always be
true from here on in.  Once a genre is established, you define certain
elements unique to it and that will continue to hold true here.  I
personally think people will at some point get sick of a continual PvE exp
grind type game.  You have to admit no matter how good a programmed AI is,
nothing compares to facing a human opponent in ANYTHING.  While this mindset
has not set in among the majority of MMORPG players at this point, I do feel
it is only a matter of time before it does.  Sure, there will always be
problems of 12 year olds ganking and such, but I am sure the newer games
will also develop methods to counteract that.   And besides, I am also sure
there will options for people to escape PvP 100% in all upcoming MMORPG's
(except Shadowbane).  I just believe that someday, that will be the
minority.
