Just my 2 cents.

I read the various posts and I am left to think ...if the developers know of
the exploits why don't they just fix them!

Punishing a person or groups of people because they are smarter then the
developer/programmer/designer is a bit overboard. If I were the developer,
I'd be like 'damn, these guys are good' and I'd find a way to fix what was
broken instead of slamming them for using the game within the boundaries
that I had set.

Hell, I'd find a way to reward characters/people who brought items like this
to my attention.
