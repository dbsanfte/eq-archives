With an mmrpg... you can have a month to month breakdown of total
subscribers. You can't get better measurements than that. Lucasarts choosing
SOE was based on far more relevant facts than 'box sales'.

Same is true of retail games. I own half a dozen titles I havent even gotten
around to installing...
Hell same is true of windows, between piracy and upgrades there is no way to
count the number of installed versions of windows 98. How many of those
copies are on hard drives sitting in a dump...how many people upgraded
windows 98 to 2000 (which is NOT on the MS upgrade path) how many people
bought a machine with win98 on it and have since switched to linux... how
many copies are licensed for computers that can't even run it...(e.g. the
new MS school licensing program requires you purchase licenses for every
computer on the site... including macs. So theres a bunch of Apples out
there with licenses of Windows OSes allocated to them...)

By that logic linux would be a terrible piece of software... meanwhile it
closes the gap to windows with each iteration...  your argument makes sense
'logically' but its clearly incomplete because it fails to reflect the real
world.

Guess you haven't heard of the EQ Server Emulator project...play EQ on your
lan...sure u lose out on Sony's 'vision' of EQ... but hey, on the plus side
you lose out on Sony's 'vision' of EQ ;)

In a functioning open market recorded music would be rapidly approaching
free... only the dysfunctional oligolopoly/cartel that is the music industry
has preserved the status quo to extent that it has.
