I checked out EQ Widows once and there were some pretty pathetic stories
there but I couldn't help but notice that there seemed to be some other
problems as well with these people, like depression for one.

I don't know how many men and women would consider themselves EQWidows, but
it's got to be a very small percentage compared to the number of people
playing EQ.  If as many as a thousand people fall into this category, thats
still only one fourth of one percent of players that take the game too far.
That low of a percentage certainly shouldn't promt such dire warnings for
the general EQ population.
