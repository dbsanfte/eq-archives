John... I'm afraid you are so completely missing the point.  You have 
created an artificial barrier.  A seperation that makes one player low 
level, and another high.

The game is made to be played!  It's made for you to adventure, level, and 
then move on to the higher level places.  If you have a problem with 
things not being added for YOU, then you haven't been looking... 
EVERYTHING has been added FOR YOU, and Jeremiah, and me... AA skills?  
Added for you too.  The fact that you can't access them now isn't the 
point, they are there for you to access once you've completed the 
pre-reqs.

Because the number of high level players only increases!  You get to level 
60, you stay there, while everyone behind you catches up.  10 level 
60's today?  30 tomorrow.  10 Level 20's today?  maybe a few more, maybe a 
few less, but some of those level 20's are now in their 30's and exploring 
new content to them.

> they should get this new stuff cause their gods.

No, it's because the content needs to increase to match the increase in 
POPULATION of that level range.  The numbers of Level 60s only increase.
