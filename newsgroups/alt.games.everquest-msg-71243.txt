I had to do a cr from kithicor, during the haloween stuff. They were
spawning (not as many) during the daytime!
My necro and IVU did the job splendidly. Dont rely on it to much. There are
nasty wolves (dire wolves?) that arnt undead.
Best bet is to wait till just after 6am, and use the zone walls, or go
through feeroot/RM. Would be consistent with tox,NK and bb if there were a
scion/spires in wc.
