I meant as the "true motivating force". Obviously "oil" is the only
reason anyone bothers with the Middle East. Keeping the region as
stable as possible is in the best interest of every industrialized
nation dependent on petroleum products, but that isn't that same thing
as "blood for oil" that all the peaceniks are crying about. The US has
a long and record of giving whole countries back to the original
owners after defeating them in combat. Funny how so many assume that
this won't be the case once SH and his regime are removed from Iraq.

The Saudi's (or more importantly the Saudi government) aren't trying
to amass WMD, nor are they sporting a bruised ego over getting their
ass kicked in '91. The war against terrorism and those that fund it is
ongoing.

North Korea is a completely different type of problem. NK is starving
and on the brink of collapse due to the failure of communism. They are
far more likely to use the "bomb" as leverage to extort the US/UN into
financial aid.

The UN and US congress/senate are more of a personal embarrassment to
GWB senior than SH. GWB takes the wrap for being "weak" in '91 when it
was the US congress and senate that lost thier nerve when they and the
UN refused to finish what they started.

SH is acting obnoxious (and has been for the last 10 years) because
the appeasers in the UN haven't done a damn thing about it. It boggles
the mind to think that after all of the effort spent defeating SH in
'91 no one collectively had the guts to remove him from power. The
cease-fire only prolonged the inevitable.

That is where you are missing the point. Iraq will never be a threat
"militarily" to the US. The threat is an Iraqi government headed by a
nut like SH having no qualms about selling/giving WMD to a group like
Al Qeda for use against the US or other western nations. There is far
too much evidence showing Iraqi support of terrorism to allow things
to continue as they have. It is only a matter of time before another
9/11 occurs, and the longer you leave SH in power the sooner it will
happen.

A nuclear armed Korea is only marginally more of a threat than they
were before. North Korea's ties to China has always given them access
to the "bomb". North Korea has been and will continue to be a
"contained threat".

>And please tell me in which century you think the Mideast might possibly become

I said "more stable". The only way to fix the problems in the middle
east is to depopulate it and start over. I am not advocating such
extreme measures. Just pointing out that the problems will never be
solved. That being said leaving a nut like SH in power is simply
asking for trouble.

I never said it wasn't. I am merely refuting the limited and incorrect
view that "oil" is the sole motivating factor. As stated above, I
don't think any industrialized nation would waste any effort on the
Middle East if they didn't have an exploitable natural resource. The
role of "oil" in this matter falls under the "keeping the region
stable" catagory. Iraqi oil simply is not that important to the US or
the US economy. If it was, sanctions would have been lifted long ago.

Aye, there's the rub.

I think we are arguing the same point from different directions :-)
