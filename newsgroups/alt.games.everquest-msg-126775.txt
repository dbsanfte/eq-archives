Aww, darn it, now yer bein' all reasonable and agreeable.  I sense the 
impending end of a fine debate.  Sigh... :)

Well... "scrap the whole project" may have been a bad choice of words.  
The thing is, it is simple for you (or I, actually) to avoid such 
behaviours.  Others less acclimated to speaking in a cuss-free style may 
not find it so simple.

It's a matter of degree of offense, rather than offended or not.  One can 
be as offensive, or even more offensive, without using naughty words as 
with.  To localize the example:  I bet if you went back through this 
ewsgroup's history, and looked at the posts of our most egregious trolls, 
you wouldn't find a clear correlation between the frequency of their 
profanity and the number of offended followups.  Unless we're going to 
consider phrases like "druids need to be nerfed!" as profane. :)

}I don't think it's necessary to split hairs to make a difference for
}the better, nor do I think the OP was remotely suggesting such.

Well, what's spltting hairs for you may not be for all your fellow 
posters.  "What do you mean tone it down?  I only swore eight or nine 
times in that last post!"

The intent of "Can we tone it down?" posts seems obvious, but their effect 
easily leans more toward making people self-conscious about what they say, 
and in that vein, the "Can we tone it down?" post itself begins to offend 
me, personally.  But that's ok, I can live with a bit of offense.

I may not agree with what is said, but I wil defend to the tedium its 
right to be said.

Well, unless I disagree with it a lot. :)
