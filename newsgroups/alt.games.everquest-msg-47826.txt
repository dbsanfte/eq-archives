Heya,

    I'm not going to flame or "bitch" at you.  However, you should be
already aware of this being technically illegal.  The software STILL has a
"copyright" on it, regardless if you need a key or own an "account."

    Flaming is one thing, informing you along with others that may agree
that they are incorrect in believing so is different.
