>>> Unless you have a very good weapon, your total damage output will be
higher medding/dotting than swinging your weapon. I seriously doubt that
this is any faster than dot/DS at level 24. <<<

I was tailoring my response to the level 24 ranger, whom I replied to. I've
never played a ranger, but I don't suppose they would have very many dots
(if any) at that level.

I, a level 28 necro, have a very good weapon .... it's called "a pet".
