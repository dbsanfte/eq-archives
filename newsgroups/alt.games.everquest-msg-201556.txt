You only need the basic game to start.  I've seen it as low as 4.99 at
Frys.
The various expanions add content (more zones, mobs, quests, etc) and
features but are not required for an intro into EQ.  Expansions are:
Kunark - added content and Iksar playable race.
Velious - added higher end content
Luclin - added Nexus (15 min ports to spires scattered around), the
Bazaar (players selling stuff to each other), new content, and Vah
Shir playable race.
POP - added very high end content, instant transportation system
LOY - added minor content, interface change (charms) and new playable
race Frogloks.

I used to play on 56K modem long ago.

Best solo types are Beastlord, Necro, Mage and Druid.  But the game
gets boring fast if all you do is solo.

I like Castersrealm and Alakazams.

Do you have a high end machine and very good graphics card?
