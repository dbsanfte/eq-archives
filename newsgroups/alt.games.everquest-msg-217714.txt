Interesting.  And I thought my brewing would be useless :P

As for stacking with KEI and the rest of the enchanter mana pool buffs, 
they should.  The chanter buffs generally have their mana pool increase in 
slot 1 while these go in slot 4, and none of 'em have specific stacking 
tags that would block something like this in slot 4.  If you click the 
"stacking" link at the top right of the lucy page you can see which spells 
will have stacking issues with the current spell you're looking at.
