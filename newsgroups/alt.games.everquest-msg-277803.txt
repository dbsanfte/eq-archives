As others have said, charisma above a certain point doesn't affect
prices.  I'm pretty sure the max needed is 104.  That assumes the
merchant is no worse than indifferent to you.  (If apprehensive, the
price will be higher; at dubious, he won't even sell to you.  Of
course, you may be able to overcome that by using Sneak and coming
up from behind him.)

I believe I've seen cases where prices were affected by CHA over 104
and/or faction better than indifferent, but they are rare.  For
instance, some merchants offer worse prices than others (the one in
the newbie Freeport yard, for instance, or the Ogre just inside the
gates).  I think two of the Iksar merchants in Field of Bone are like
that, but after I got faction up to amiable or so, and CHA 140ish,
I was able to get the same prices from them as from other merchants.

CHA does have other uses, of course.  I'm told it affects how well
Charm works, for example, though I've never played a charm class.
