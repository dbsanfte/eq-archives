Tried to post this before, but in my haste I might have screwed it
up....anyway...

I am interested, or rather, my son is interested in playing EQ (he's almost
13).  We have 4 computers tied together on a 4-port router through a cable
modem.  I have an account and all the software and expansions.

My question is:  Do I have to re-buy all the software and expansions, or
just load the stuff on his computer and then get him an account?

Let me know if I am going to have to spend some bucks here....

Thanks in advance...

 - Jon
