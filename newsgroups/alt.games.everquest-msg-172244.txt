After boasting here about how simple chromo's are (for a 60+ cleric) I screwed up my
courage and tried one with my little 53 bard.  Charmed a wurm and sent him in to do
the dirty work... foolish plan.  Of course the charms didn't last long, since the
chromo was dispelling them!.    Ended up running to zone (I pulled the pair near OT
just in case) and having to use a combo of healsong and bandaging just to stay alive
till the buff wore off.

Fully healed, I went back in to try again.  This time, chromo pet on wurm.  Didn't
work much better.  I'm not sure if the chromo was dispelling itself, or just has a
very high chance of breaking charm (some mobs seem to).

OK, well, try three, fear kite.  Bard fear kiting sucks, I've never liked it much,
my melee output is unimpressive to say the least, and I have to dedicate two song
slots out of a 4 twist just to keeping the mob snared and feared.  Fear range (it's
PB) is very short, so when snare drops, fear often drops shortly thereafter (I'm
chasing the chromo trying to refresh fear because I deem that more important than
snare under the circumstances).  Well I'm sure an experience bard fear kiter would
have done better, but it was quite difficult for me to keep the chromo under
control, and for a third time in a row I ended up running to zone with one pissed
off (but mezmerized) chromo behind me, and having to sing away AND bind wounds to
keep from dying.  With either a snare partner or a fear partner, and certainly with
a healing partner, this wouldn't have been so bad.

Take four (I'm dedicated, if nothing else) I used the old reliable chant kite,
though with some trepidation.  Sure enough, this ended up being a bit of a pain.
I'd regularly get my selos dispelled (6 seconds to get it back up) and got dotted at
least a dozen times.  But shortly after getting dotted, I'd get the dot dispelled,
each time as well.  Took the chromo down and was myself down only half a bubble of
health.  Did five more same way, just to be sure, the Worst damage I took put me
down a bubble and a half, and that was due to the chromo catching me and stunning me
while my selos was down, rather than from the DOTs.

Five chromos, two sunlights, and a pile of apparantly useless wings.

So I'd say -for a bard- my "no buffs" plan worked like a charm on the little
buggers, at level 53, with a whopping 1500 unbuffed HP total.  (yes, I really ought
to get some gear, but normally I hardly take any damage at all, so I've been able to
concentrate on just leveling up, rather than gathering equipment together)
