Try doing that while being chased by a pack of sonic wolves...

The problems with SH and the maps as they are now isn't that they let 
the player orient themselves reliably, its that they let themselves 
orient themselves in real time without the slightest bit of effort or 
skill, whilst fleeing for their lives...

If they had to stop, dig up an iron bar and a coconut and always got a 
good SH out it, I wouldn't have the slighest problem with that.

If they could pinpoint poin their position and heading on the map, with 
a 30 second skill refresh it would still allow players to navigate maps, 
and so on, but players wouldn't be running around in 'map mode'.
