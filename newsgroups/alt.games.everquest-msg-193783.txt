Someone mentioned to me the other day that begging increases hate with mobs.
Got me to thinking that classes that don't have a taunt could potentially
use Beg as a cheap taunt.  And even classes with a taunt could use it as an
extra one.

Now obviously you can't use Beg while autoattack is on, but I made a hotkey
on my BL that looks like this...

/attack off
/doability x
/attack on

Now since I solo I don't really see the effects of this as I'm the only one
the mob could agro when I'm up on him, but wondering if anyone has tested
this to see if it is actually effective at all.
