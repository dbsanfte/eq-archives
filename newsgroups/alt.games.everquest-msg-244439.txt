40ish is far too long. 15 second duration is ok... 'my proposed vision' 
of a monk isn't someone who is only going to get hit every 40 minutes. A 
'few minutes' would be more appropriate imho.

Maybe 'automatic' is too strong. Maybe pre-activated, but not 
timer-running-down until you take a hit would be better.

In EQ you often don't know you are going to get hit, until you get 
hit... mobs lag and warp, the hits are not in sync with the animation so 
there is really no legitimate way of anticipating a hit and triggering a 
defensive discipline... except to either "guess when you enter a 
situation that might be dangerous"... or "wait until it hits you once"...

The first scenario is fine but with a duration of 2 ticks, it would 
likely be half run out before the mob even turns on you. And there are 
many situations where you still will get hit without warning.

And the second scenario sort of defeats the purpose.

Not at all.

And the re-use on this is ridiculous. My point was that monks should be 
able to usefully mitigate 90%+ damage often enough that they could do it 
as part of regular play... but not quite often enough that they could 
main tank.

Yup... but again the recast makes it a 'special event' not regular play.
