Just to pick nits here, Fey still does spawn on the same 72 hour random
timer as the other Kunark Dragons.  He spawns near the firepot room and his
pathing will take him from there to the checkerboard island, where he will
be aggroed and killed by the Iksar Master, lvl 65 Iksar Monk guild trainer.
In my old guild, druids woud sit in TD and wait for Fey to pop on Tracking,
and they would kite him around the southwestern part of the zone, until the
raid party showed up and and buffed up.   The random Fey also still drops
items from his loot table, which consists of  Vox/Naggy's loot table in
addition to Shield of the Water Dragon, and a chunk of Sea Dragon meat.  His
forced form only drops the druid epic piece.
