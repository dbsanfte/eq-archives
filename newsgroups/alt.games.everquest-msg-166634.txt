There may actually be one or two people who "truly believe".  All the
rest believe only that they ought to be able to do as they please at
all times and in all places, and they will grudgingly acquiesce to
rules that dictate otherwise only when they cannot evade or defeat
the enforcement of said rules.  When you get hung up on the details of
their rationalizations you are playing their game by their rules, and,
surprise!, their rules dictate that they win and you lose.

I personally was ambivalent about the specifics of the old naming
policy.  But it was loads better than the current non-policy, IMO, so
I wish they'd kept it.

Forget the "deep down" crap.  What matters is that they don't care
whether their protests are valid or not, all that matters to them is
whether or not they can do as they please.  If you somehow convinced
them to admit that the RP server rationalization was bogus they'd just
invent a different rationalization.

There never was a general acceptance that EQ was about roleplaying in
the more traditional sense.  And since even among roleplayers there's
a lot of disagreement about what constitutes legitimate roleplaying
(with many like me who disagree vehemently with the idea that RPing
is defined by the "thee/thou" romanticized arthurian crowd), you're
never going to get everybody behind any particular definition of
roleplaying.  As to justification, why in hell would you want to
justify SOE's policies to anybody?  Let them do their own justification
if they feel the need, you're just engaging in the same sort of
rationalization as the LookAtMyReallyStupidName(tm) bozos from the
opposite direction.

Lokari had it right, she jumped on names in violation of the policy
because they violated the policy.  She never tried to justify her
actions in any other way.  And you should simply refuse to have
anything to do with the bozos, because their names offend you.  Don't
try to justify your behavior in any other way.  Be honest, be clear,
and avoid getting hung up on anybody's rationalizations, including
your own.
