I can certainly agree with you on those points. Most of all the
communications issue. As somebody who has led multi-guild raids, I can
tell you that it can get very annoying. The lack of a /raid channel and
inability to use the /guild channel due to multiple guilds forces us to
have the group leaders in /ooc and me in /shout. Usually have to ask
anyone else hunting in the zone to just /ignore us for the duration. A
/raid channel would be a huge improvement, and Verant has indicated that
they agree and will work to put one in.

The xp thing........ I don't know. I guess it would be nice if everyone
got an equal share of the xp, but on a large raid that would wind up
being an immeasurably small trickle of xp, so I'm not sure it would
matter.  Maybe we're all just too used to the concept of "Raid= zero xp,
chance at loot" to bother complaining anymore.
