Well, if you read the survey, it's pretty obvious that he takes some care 
to make the data statistically significant.  His methodology is pretty 
good, and from what I remember you had to sign in to participate.

Actually, since you can't be bothered to read it, you have no right to 
disparage it.  I've posted the link, you are making some asinine comments 
and you haven't even read the thing.  The methods appear legitimate to me, 
though I do not possess an advanced degree in polling theory.  He states 
that he had approximately 4000 individuals respond, and they filled out a 
total of 15,000 surveys.  One percent participation on a survey of this 
size is a remarkably large percentage, and I would guess that the margin 
of error on this survey is within a couple percentage points.  
Just as a point of fact, the average political poll that I see involves 
less than 1000 registered voters, yet they are almost alwasy within 2-3 
percentage points of the final tally.  How can they do that?  Is it magic?  
Is it a huge conspiracy?  Or maybe, just maybe, there is enough science 
and experimental knowledge behind the theory that it actually works?

Seriously, you're edging into kookdom here.  Remember, shiny side out.
