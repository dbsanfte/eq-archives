Here's the problem..
I'm trying to reinstall EQ after being away for two years.  Old World
and Kunark loaded up ok to the directory E:\Everquest, so did Velious.
But when I get to Luclin I do not get an option to select that
directory. The files actually got dumped into my C:\Windows  and made
a f*&king mess. How the hell do I get it to go to the E: drive???
