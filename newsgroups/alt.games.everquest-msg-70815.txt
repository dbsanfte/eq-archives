Keep in mind that we're both talking about guild hunts only.

I keep the cleric alive more often than he keeps me alive and yet I don't
get the loot he does?  I play an enchanter...you can't BE in the middle of
17 frogs and lizard necros in Seb for a few hours without me either.

But hey, if you want to pay a cleric by the hour that's cool...maybe I
should start an Enchanter Guild and demand the same net (after peridot cost)
profit.

And obviously you have tens of thousands of plat laying around.  I have 5k
on my level 55 enchanter and 200p on my 52 druid.  Maybe you're uber and can
afford to donate for the hell of it to a cleric...I can't.

I've been playing since 3/99 and I haven't ONCE even THOUGHT that 1000p as
"one stinking KPP."  Must be great to be rolling in cash...pass about 10k to
me...maybe 20k and I'll stop bitching, Mr. "1kp is NOTHING."
