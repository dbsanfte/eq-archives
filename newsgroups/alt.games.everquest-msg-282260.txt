I am stuck in the Mines of Gloomingdeep. The first time I went in, I
got as far as killing the jailer and then everything stops; NPC Arias
does not respond and I don't know how to get out of there.(What the
correct wording is. However, if Arias is not responding...?) I can camp
out and log back in and it puts me back to the beginning of the
Tutorial. Also, when logging in, I am not given the option to Return to
Home . How do I fix this other than deleting my new character and
starting another one? Thank you in advance! Winsome, Level 2 Cleric. :)
