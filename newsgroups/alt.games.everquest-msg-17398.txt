I recently took up baking (after losing all my money trying to learn 
smithing), and I make a fairly good profit (dont know the exact amount, 
but it's more than 20 pp an hour, I make 1 pp + a few silver per stack of 
fish fillets)...just follow what Eleena said (you can find Jugs of Sauce 
at the inn in East Commonlands though, you dont have to go to WC), and 
you will be making money in no time. If you can spare the practice 
points, you might want to dump as many as possible into baking so you can 
have a head start.
