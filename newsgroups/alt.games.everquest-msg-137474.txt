Do you guys bother with the FA?

We haven't since the patch/nerf.. debating getting some rez sticks for the
various keyed monkeys, but even with a rez stick that would be one hell of a
run down, including going through a room of casting mobs.

Theres a guild new to ST (maybe 2 clearings) and all they kill is the FA
(mainly because the other 2 named live about 10 mins after popping)
