Even if that is the case, why on earth do the clocks need to be changed?
The farmer can't change what time of day he gets up?  Is that a really
difficult task?  There are a number of reasons I have heard, usually having
to do with kids going to and from school during daylight, and/or saving
electricity by having as much of the workday as possible occur during the
daylight hours.  There is absolutely no need to change clocks for this.  All
you have to do is adjust what time school/work/whatever starts if you must.
Or are people incapable of getting up because the clock reads 5:00AM instead
of 6:00AM now?
