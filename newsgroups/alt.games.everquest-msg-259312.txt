Rangers follow the same basic soloing rules as druids, if it doesnt summon,
you can kill it, if you can snare it, its an easy kill.

Tantor in WW is 66? :P Have soloed him, hes gimp though...

There are some exceptions to these rules (ie can kill some summoners, and
need space to kite unsnareables).

Rangers solo better with haste, best is self haste (eyepatch of plunder at
the least (20% spell haste), but preferbly DCoTS (50% instant cast 3 tick
haste).

Dark Cloak is pretty easy to get these days I would imagine (still a rare
drop, though I have seen it twice out of 4 KoS kills).
