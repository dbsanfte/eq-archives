Modifying gameplay by providing instant access to information not
normally available. Technically, yes, EQAtlas, etc maps provide the
same information, but since these aren't programs that monitor game
data, interpret it, and send such precise information instantly,
they're not in violation.

This program is a hack. That simple.
