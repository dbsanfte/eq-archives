Don't worry about it. Trust me, you would(most likely) be miserable starting
that character over again(at your level, or any other above level 10 at the
most). I used to have that problem; it constantly worried me that I hadn't
created my character in an optimal fashion.

All stats can be raised, and most of the important stats(Str, Sta, Wis and
Int are the only ones that can cause big problems) can easily be raised past
200. You could be a Human Wizard that put all his stats into Str and Sta and
you would still have no trouble getting your Int to 200, you'd just have to
work a little harder.

Besides, it's a game, games are meant to be fun. Don't ruin the fun of the
game by worrying too much about your character.
