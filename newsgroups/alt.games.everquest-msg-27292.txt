No "decent" quests that I know of. I just suffered through the first 4
levels fighing rats, bats, and snakes. Once I got to level 4 I could
kill 3-4 (rats,bats, and snakes) at the same time with ease using the
lvl2 AE DoT spell.

I chose Freeport for roleplay reasons. A Kelethin Bard can do much
better running mail between Felwithe (sp), Kaladim and Ak'Anon (sp).
You can easily level to 3-4 by delivering mail. You combat skills will
suffer, so I woudl recommend fighting trough most of 2-3 once you get
some gold in your pocket.

This is very true. One thing I did at level 1 was to loot every corpse
in the area left to rot. Bats, Rats, Snakes all drop stackable items,
and most people leave them to rot. It doesn't take long to gather up a
couple gold pieces worth of loot and buy that first spell.

Cheers
