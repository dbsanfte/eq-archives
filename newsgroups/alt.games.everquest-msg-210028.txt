My take on a CH chain, from the perspective of a wizard & enchanter who sits
IRL 10 feet from a 65 cleric on every raid:

Set up a hotkey
/cast 1 (or wherever you keep CH)
/cast 1 (fizzlecatcher)
/gsay >>>11111 CH %T 11111<<<
/1  >>>11111 CH %T 11111<<<

Change /1 to whatever channel the healers are using.  Change the 1s on the
/say and /1 lines to whatever number you are in the CH chain.  The idea is
to be COMPLETELY clear about which number you are in the chain, and who you
are CHing.  DO tell your group you're casting a CH, they need to know.  Be
sure you put the /casts first, then the chatter - each line of chat text
takes a quarter-second to go, that's a delay in the CH chain you can't
afford.

In my admittedly-limited experience, there are 3 hard truths about CH
chains.

1)  You heal NOBODY but the MT.  If you take a moment to drop a quick heal
on someone in your group and are a half-second late with your CH, you just
wiped the raid.  Healing your group - and you! - is what druids do on raids,
and shamans after slow is in, and any clerics not in the CH chain if you
have the luxury of spare clerics.  A CH-chain cleric who lets their entire
group die, but keeps the MT propped up, has done their job.  This is the
HARDEST thing for a cleric to learn - that sometimes the group has to die so
the raid can survive.

2)  You must pay attention every second - every instant! - of the chain.  If
the person ahead of you in the chain drops, you have to be ready to step in.
If the person BEHIND you drops, you have to know that your next turn in the
chain is coming sooner!  (In a six-person chain with a six-second interval,
you're casting every 36 seconds.  If a cleric drops and goes LD, you're
suddenly in a five-person chain and you're casting every 30 seconds.)  No
potty breaks, bring an empty Big Gulp .

3)  Work out the chain of command in advance.  Many raid guilds will have a
"Lead Cleric" who sets up the heals and assigns CH chain positions.  The
interval on the chain can and likely will change over the course of the
fight; for example, after 3 minutes when Defensive wears off, the interval
has to shorten to compensate for increased damage on the MT.  Depending on
your guild's rules, the MT or the Lead Cleric should be calling the change
of interval.  When the interval changes, be ready to adjust immediately -
but know WHO is permitted to call an interval change, and don't change
interval unless an authorized person tells you that you should.
