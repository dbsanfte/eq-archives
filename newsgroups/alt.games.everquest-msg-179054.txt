I'm a near-41 Human Paladin on the Rathe.

I soloed 39 and most of 40 by whacking Tribal Sambatas between the GE
and ME zones in DSP.

I'd drop 50pp on KEI in the Bazaar, run to DSP and begin committing
Sambata Genocide.

Between my Abram's Axe of the Stoic (SCHW haste), sometimes Frosty and
a good shield, Root and Greater Heal, I can work on as many as 5
con-blue tribal gatherers at once with little risk.

I've made 1y an hour consistently with this technique.
