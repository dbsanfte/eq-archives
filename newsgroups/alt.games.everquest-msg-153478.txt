OK, seeing as how many of my few posts here have been ranting and
steam blowing-off sessions, I figured that in the name of fairness, I
HAD to share this one.

Here's the set up...I'm in Paludal Caverns last night, managed to get
a group for my warrior nice and quick.  But it's CROWDED...38 people
in the zone kind of crowded.  But you know, we're getting by - we
don't have the full run of B1, but it's all goog.  Anyway, suddenly
the bandit I aggroed isn't hitting me anymore, just as I saw a puller
for the group that we're sharing B1 with run by.  OK says I, mistaken
KS.  I was a little grumpy, but these things happen, right?  Then a
couple pulls later, wham, KSd again, just after aggroing a mob.  OK,
now I'm fuming.  First intstinct is to send a NASTY tell to said
puller.  But I prevail...I send him a tell that says something like
"OK dude, we have to work something out here.  Want to split the
camp?".  What do I get in return, you ask?  I get a curt "Talk to
Xarthis".  OK, so now I'm REALLY fuming...I extended the olive branch,
and then promptly got whacked with it..

So NOW, I REALLY want to to send a nasty tell to this Xarthis, telling
him what a dick his puller is blah blah blah.  But again, I muster all
my powers of self restraint, and I repeat my message "Look, this sucks
for both of us, how about we divide the camp".  He replies for me to
wait a second - I assume he was conferring with his group, as I was
with mine.  Anyway, he comes back with "How about you take the pops on
your right, and we'll take the pops on our right".  I'm like "Cool,
with me facing the water, right?", and he comes back with a simple
"Yeah".  I follow up with "What about Yelloweyes, he pops right in
front of us".  He comes back with "Hmmm...".  I can tell he's
hesitating, so I send back "Hey, doesn't that named chick pop over on
your side?", and he comes back with a cheery "Oh yeah, you're right!
Cool, yeah, that sounds good" and basically, the two groups lived in
peace and harmony the rest of the night, and all was good with the
world. 

Oh yeah, and my group seemed to find it amusing that when they asked
me what I was doing (I had told them the issue was pretty much
resolved, with the camp split), I replied "Negotiating Yelloweyes".  I
thought at the time, "WTF are they laughing at...", but in retrospect,
I think *I* would have laughed too.....
