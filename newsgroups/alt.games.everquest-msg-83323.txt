recently, I ranted about gathering petls for tailoring skill. one of you
suggested hunintg  polor cubs in Everfrost.  I found they were common drops
on them little critters.

I ran upto Halas to find a vendor that sold patterns.  as I searched, I
found a vendor with ruined bear pelts.  I first thought maybe one or two on
that slot.  for the heck of it, I clicked to buy 20.  *ching* 20 in my bag.

To my surprise, the pelt was still on the vendor slot.  I selected another
20, and another, and another....until I had two full backpacks.  I was a bit
shocked....I checked the vendor in the same area to see what they
had....bang...ruined bear pelts.  I selected another 20...(had to destroy
some grub for space)...and she still had a supply.

did Verant actually bring these items to vendors?

I'm thinking if ruined are available, then there's a good chance that low,
med, and possibly high are available somewhere.  what about spiderling
silks?  I haven't found a vendor yet, but would sure like to find one.  I'm
thinking it should be a land where Spiders are extremly common...EK?
