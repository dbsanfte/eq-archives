Except I said (A few times) that I realize that I should have done a who on
the guy and, if I had made myself more familiar with the races who can play
wizard, this would not have happened. That was my part of the blame. He did
not tell me that he was going to take me to Butcherblock and not GFay which
was his part. In other words, I am saying we both are to blame.
