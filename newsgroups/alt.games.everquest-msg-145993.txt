hmm.... One of my machines has no issues with the bazaar but another
is a dog.... I set my veiwport

/viewport 0 0 320 240

its a small view port but it works wonders... NO, it is not smooth...
it works though... of course I have all other features turned off as
well... no Luclin models, clipping all the way down, spelleeffects off
etc..

Luck to you.
