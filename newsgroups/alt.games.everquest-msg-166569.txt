    Sorry for cutting in, but the bards in my guild have just posted another
reason why FT is so huge for them. The Escape method that bards have works
off mana. The one bard in my guild estimated that with FT V total, she could
Escape often enough to be a superior puller to a monk in XP situations. She
called it the number one thing she's looking for right now in gear, and the
last thing she expects to get given her class. I'm just lucky I got my Mask
of Piety BEFORE she posted this!
