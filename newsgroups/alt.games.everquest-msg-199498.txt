As I understand it, merchants are treated specially so they never con lower
than dubious, no matter what their "true" faction is. This is to prevent
major zone disruption every time a KOS person runs through the zone.

The only way to know for sure is to find a non-merchant on the merchant
faction and con him as a reference point.

Example: All but one or two merchants in Cabilis are on Cabilis Residents
faction. They never conned less than dubious to my dark elf. But there are
some iksar on Cabilis Residents that are not merchants (Banker, Fizazz)
who started off scowling. *These* are the guys I used to check my faction
against, not regular merchants.

"True" dubious to amiable is only 600 faction points. You could well have
started at max kos to merchants without knowing it. It could also be that
the faction quest you're using gives you more stormguard faction than
it does merchant faction.
