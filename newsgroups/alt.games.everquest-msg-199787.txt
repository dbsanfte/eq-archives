Aye I agree with Palludal - with that zone leveling from 8 (its the lowest i
ever went in but i can see how a 7 could group in there) to 18 solo on the
Shadeweaver side of the zone has become a no-brainer. Once in the higher
teens head to Palludal by zoning in from Shadow Haven (crossing the zone at
that level is a good way to find out just how large trains can get) From
that side you can get groups at the bandit camps as well as partnering on
the fiends in that area.
