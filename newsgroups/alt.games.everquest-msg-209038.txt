Stop with the self flagalation.  It was a minor mistake on your part and I
have a feeling it was a much larger mistake on their part.

Your job is to certainly keep people alive.  How you do it is up to you.  As
long as no one dies they really don't have much to bitch about.

You can keep people alive by ghetto mezzing (root), stun, nuking, melee or,
of course, healing, or any combination of them...or probably other stuff I
forgot to mention.

Just keep in mind that a group shouldn't have to slow down because of you.
What I mean is, don't melee when you're LOM (big exception at high levels
but you're not).  If you have only enough mana for one more nuke or one more
heal, then I'd gate (just kidding...maybe <eg> ).  Nah choose heal probably
90% of the time.

Nothing is cast in stone.
