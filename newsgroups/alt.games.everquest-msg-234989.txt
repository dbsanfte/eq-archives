I have a feeling that certain motherboards + Nvidia card + Everquest
just don't work.

My old 32meg PCI Nvidia works slowly but with zero crashes, but a 64
meg AGP Nvidia crashed to a reboot anywhere from a few seconds to a
few minutes into the game.

Evidence seems to support this - my friend has 2 PC's in his home, all
with identical components apart from the motherboard - even the
graphic drivers are the same and they both use the same version of
DX9.  One will play Everquest with no fuss at all, while the other
refuses even to finish the file-checking procedure and crashes every
time.  The one that crashes is stable while surfing the Net, but is a
non-starter for EQ.  It is a real nuisance...
