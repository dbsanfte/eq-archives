The Giants in EW are a bit higher I still get exp at 51. Next thing to do is
headed to Kael and you can get into groups there. Join 1 or 2 raids and you
will be well liked. It is possible to Solo in WL but stay on the zone wall.
Side note be careful if porting into WL that Woushi is not up landing spot
is well within her agro range. Unfortuneately Succro takes you from WL to EW
sides of Kael
