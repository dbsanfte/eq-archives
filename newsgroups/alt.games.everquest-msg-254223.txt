Hotkey only

Evasive: 1:  Increase Chance to Avoid Melee by 50%
             2:  Decrease Chance to Hit by 33%

Defensive: 1:  Increase Melee Mitigation by 45%
                2:  Decrease Damage Modifier by 55%
                3:  Chance to Critical Hit(0)

1 gives you an avoidance boost, the other cuts damage.  Different situations
will dictate when 1 is better than the other.. the old rule of thumb (luclin
and before) was 1k+ melee = defensive, and <1k melee evasive... things
change though, Evasive was pretty nerfed in GoD with mobs having such high
ATK figures.  I know GoD was revamped to adjust this stuff, but i don't play
much now to comment... my first day after the "revamp" i was still sorely
dissapointed

A lot of the named are 1 groupable without too much difficulty. If
Allakhazam etc doesn't say "raid target", then its a good bet its a 1 group
mob.
In the first week or so of GoD, 3 of us (monk, cleric, enchanter) walked
from the Barindu side, via the middle of the zone, to the quini side. Any
named we stumbled across (e.g elite weaponmasters) were easily dispatched
