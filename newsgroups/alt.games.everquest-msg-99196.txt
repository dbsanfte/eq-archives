I was playing with this last night. Anyone know a good way to bring up the
text box and position it just above your chat box? There are a number of
command line options which I have no idea what to set at, like the x and y
coords, how do I know the x and y coords of my screen? I just want a 5 line
text box of my hits same font and background as the chat window just above
it. Would be nice if I can move it around too. I coundt even get it to show
up on the screen.

Thanks for helpin.
