I think its very bad with any well geared hybrid... but monks
are "worst" because they have the best avoidance... supposed
to have worst AC plus best avoidance, but instead have
same AC (read best AC) plus best avoidance.

Yes, thats true, all the "castrate the monks" change does is remove the tip
of the iceberg, popping rogues and rangers up into view.  AC system
is flawed, "fix" it by instead changing one class?

7 things intended for your class, and 11 things that are intended
for general use... why?  Because monk gear stinks as monk
gear!

You say tomato, I say tomatoe... at any rate, I don't mean "warriors
suck because they go over encumberance" or something like that,
I just mean monk AC = gear AC plus monk bonus for low weight.

Assuming warrior who's already shot his Defensive, and has the same AC
and HP totals as you, who would you pick to MA?  Hmm, for the sake
of this arguement, also assume sufficient clerics to not get CHeal aggro
(which really isn't all that many clerics)

AC just strikes me as one of the worst 'features' in its current implementation,

and in this case they already have the nerf bat out, so they know its
important... they just took aim at (IMO) the wrong target.  Monks
are broken, but really its AC system flaws that makes them so,
and with POP the AC flaws are only going to become more obvious
at the high end.

Frankly, though, I feel the current AC system is bogus even at the
low end, and for Every class; more AC should always translate
to less damage per blow on average.  Currently, more AC matters
only for a few people against any given mob, most are either
well below or well above the threshold for that mob where
a change in AC won't matter.
