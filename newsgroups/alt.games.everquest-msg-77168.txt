There's not a really easy way that *I* have found to see what else should be
closed, though there probably is somewhere but I haven't figured it out yet.

If you reboot after the error and you have at least 256MB RAM and a few gigs
free on each of your hard drives you should be ok for at least a few days,
even with your firewall & virus software running (though I'd kill them
anyway).  Not much reason to have OE or MSN Messenger open since you can't
read email or messages while playing though...I'd kill 'em too. :)
