That's not a good test.

    Game        Percent of North American Market    Newsgroup
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    EverQuest           26                          heavy traffic
    SWG                 19                          light traffic
    DAoC                19                          very light traffic
    UO                  10                          almost dead

I have no idea why EQ fans took to usenet so much more than those of other
