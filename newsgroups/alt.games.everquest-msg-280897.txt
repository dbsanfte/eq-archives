You are correct Marcel. It is no longer there since the new 
tutorial. When you finish the new version, you are 
transported to PoK and told to go see an NPC in the library. 
The NPC gives you a series of tasks that introduce your 
class trainer and other NPC's who give out tasks. No mention 
of your home city is mentioned.

As an aside, several of the newbie quests are no longer 
given out by trainers in those home cities. I recently 
started a Froglok Shaman, pre new tutorial, and was given 
and completed the newbie armor quest. Post new tutorial, I 
started a Froglok Necromancer, completed the tutorial and 
was deposited into PoK much to my surprise. I also noticed 
that the char was still bound in the tutorial unlike 
previously where it would have been the home city newbie 
zone. I have found no newbie quests in Rathe for the Necro 
equivalent to the Shaman armour quest. The Shaman trainer 
also no longer says the last line of text that included the 
keyword for quests and doesn't answer to any of the phrases 
I culled from my log file.

  On Sony's site, there is a message from a developer that 
seems to imply 1-10 in tutorial, 10-20 doing quests/tasks 
found in PoK and 20-40 in LDoN. Suck much? See below.

This would imply that all home cities and newbie zones have 
become useless. It looks like they are trying the EQ2 route 
where all races/classes to the same identical quests/tasks.

I've recently come back to the game after a long absence, 
and don't like much of what I've seen so far as to future 
directions.

I've got plans for sometime in the future to evaluate the 
point system in LDoN and make adjustments, especially at the 
low end. Ideally, we'd like players to walk out of the 
tutorial at 10, do the various quests in POK until 20, and 
then hit LDoN for a good portion of their 20-40s for 
directed play. To accomplish this, however, the point system 
(or the cost of items, really) needs to be changed so that 
you get enough points to buy items before you level. 
Currently in LDoN, players will outgrow the items they are 
trying to save up for by doing LDoN adventures, because they 
level up faster than they can save.

I'll be looking at the post-50 LDoN points/rewards, but my 
main goal is to make LDoN a viable place for new players to 
meet up and play in.
