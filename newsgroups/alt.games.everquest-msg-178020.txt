I would have to agree with you.  KC and other dungeons are fun, and they are
dangerous, hence the experience modifier.  Sure it's fun to mow down the
mobs easily, but it's also fun to break up the fun with 'you tell group"I
just saw a bunch of guys run past here.  Might not be good" and wind up
having to run.
There's also the comraderie of sitting in the entranceway to KC in DL
healing/medding up with a sliver of health and trying to discuss "What went
wrong...."  even if it was just a case of getting trained.  And doesn't it
feel good when your group manages to whomp down someone elses hella train?
