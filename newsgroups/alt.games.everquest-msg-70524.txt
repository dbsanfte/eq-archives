/em blushes furiously

I knew my guild would miss me; I didn't realize my fame had spread so far.

It's been a convergence of a lot of things. Family issues limited my play time for
a while, and numerous SoL problems (my second computer must continue to run Win
95; it is my dev machine and I have customers to support; can't run two accounts
at a time with one machine. Even my new speedster with Win 2k has difficulties in
the old world zones. And lets face it: the most appropriately nicknamed SoL was
very poorly tested, very poorly released and then very poorly "fixed"; many of the
promised improvements never materialized and there remains things that have been
broken and/or incomplete for more than two years.)

A friend got me involved with Dark Ages of Camelot, and to put it bluntly, I have
found that the annoyances there are far more bearable than the annoyances of EQ.
Mythic is ankles above Verant when it comes to customer services (for pity sake,
Mythic even has an official message board where you can read about broken quests
and get notice of when and how those quests have been fixed!) and they have
promised to complete the game and fix problems before they start work on
expansions, so their attention is focused on improving the game. DAoC still has
some holes and is in, as I put it, "post beta"; but over all, I simply enjoy there
more than here.

And yes, I'm getting burned out. I've been playing EQ since September of 2000 and
I've enjoyed myself immensely (despite my complaints about Verant, EQ is a great
game.) I never got terribly far -- Rosewhite, my highest level character, is only
level 32 -- partially because I liked to play different characters, do tradeskills
and just socialize. Still, that is an awfully long time to be doing the same basic
thing.

I may return at some point, but for now, Rosewhite (and Tvon and Witte and the
others in my family) are hanging up their adventuring shoes. Rosewhite is
considering a position as Druid trainer in Rivervale. Maybe young halfling druids
will see her still :-P
