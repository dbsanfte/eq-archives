My wife asks the same thing, but have you seen all there is to see? Visited
every zone?  Have you mastered every trade skill?  Are your class skills
maxed out?  Is it the same doing it solo?  How many class/race combos are
there?  If you just picked one class for instance, how different is it with
each race?  Can you excel as a ranger or druid without killing animals?  Can
you excel in role-playing, refusing all twinks and offers of assistance?
Have you been a guild officer and managed that responsibility?

I've already noticed how much money I'm saving by renting less videos,
spending less on other entertainment pursuits, etc.  My wife just started
taking college classes now that we have teenagers and I can play to my
heart's content without her being upset at the inordinate amount of time I
spend playing.  For whatever it costs to play (about $8.50 a month) EQ is a
bargain, and a 1000 times better than the MUDs I had been playing.  I just
wish I could catch up on all the reading that's not getting done in my
library.
