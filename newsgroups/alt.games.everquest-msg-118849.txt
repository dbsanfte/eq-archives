Alas, no I hadn't. I use Google.com to view the newsgroups and
therefore face a significant lag in seeing new posts appear.
Unfortunately, the firewall at my office prevents me from accessing
Usenet directly.

As I humbly professed in the other thread, I was mistaken in my
initial impression. I now believe he *is* a complete moron made worse
by the fact that he is dishonest.

I think I'm back on track now. Thanks DT.
