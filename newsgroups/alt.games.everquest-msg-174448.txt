Close, but not quite. Yes, the "magic number" is four because the *good*
AoE spells will only hit four targets. (The Al'Crap Bore line hits more,
but are useless as tits on a boar hog. But that's another discussion.)

As Georg pointed out, you need to either have j-boots/t-boots, or be
SoW'd via spells, potions, etc.  Then you need to aggro four mobs who
run slower than SoW.  Next, you simply run in wide circles with them
chasing you until they all group up into a bunch. 

When that's done, you cast your AoE snare spell. If they don't all get
snared, you target the one(s) who didn't, get some distance and cast
again, then proceed to round them all up again. (You'll usually want to
recast snare until they all get snared at one time with no resists.)
Once all are snared and following you in a nice pack, you begin casting
your best AoE nuke on them until they all drop. Loot, med, rinse,
repeat.

I went from 40 to 48 in *very* little time in Eastern Waste quadding the
Ulthorks and walrus.
