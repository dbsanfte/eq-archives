Hello all,
Been having major problems connecting from Australia lately, so bad that it
has stopped me from trying to get any exp as the chance of LD is really high
(1-3 time per night). I use optus on a 56k dial up and haven't had too many
problems until around 6-8 weeks ago when LD's started to become more common.
They're now at an amount when I am wondering if it is worth hanging up my EQ
boots :(
I get big chunks of packet loss that usually return after around 60%, if it
goes above this then I know I am about to go LD. More often than not they
used to come back from the 60% PL than go LD. However, now I get sudden LD's
with no hint of PL before, just minding my own business when I suddenly get
the 'you have been disconnected' screen :(

Just wondering if anyone else has had similar problem, either in Australia,
with or without optus, or anywhere else for that matter...


Hope someone can help :)

Loaf
