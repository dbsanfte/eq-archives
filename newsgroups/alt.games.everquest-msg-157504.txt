Pretty interesting site.  90% of EQ is male, and the average age is
25.  Lots of interesting polls were taken.

One thing I don't understand about this 48 hours report linking EQ
addiction to that boy's suicide:  If he was so addicted to the game,
why did he voluntarily quit so suddenly?  Preaching to the choir, I
know...
