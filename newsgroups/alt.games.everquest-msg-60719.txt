No, and I'm still betting they have to buy the horse. I just can't
imagine verant giving something free to paladins and sks if it costs 9
k for everyone else. The only way it would seem fair if it was free
was if they did not get it until level 60.

I'm still betting on it just being some uknown utility, like if the
horse whistle is NOT soulbound. Then it would be nice for the paladin
and sk while they'd still have to pay 9k for the horse. But then that
might not work either because I'm not sure if EQ can take into account
something being on your corpse.
