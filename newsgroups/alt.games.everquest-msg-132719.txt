I dunno about that.  SoW potions aren't really practical at 100pp a
stack.  They're damned nice, don't get me wrong.  My troll warrior
always has one stack on him and one in the bank.  But for general
hunting purposes, 10pp every half an hour can get expensive for most
players.  Lord knows that hunting in WL or Scarlet Desert doesn't net
my druid enough coin to keep up that kind of costs.

And if you're talking JBoots, that's hardly modestly twinked.  The
camp for those bad boys makes the platinum ring and the mutant spawn
for the Paw of Opalla a joy.

At higher levels, I'd say this is a significant problem.  When you
only have 1100 hp and a mob can hit you two or three times in one
round for 100+, you want to get hit as little as possible.

Luclin is even smaller for SoW casting classes, and yeah I was also
referring to Succor tricks.  Egress is the self only, faster casting,
lower mana cost version of Succor.  Egress is 100 mana with a 5 second
cast time.  MUCH nicer for traveling.
