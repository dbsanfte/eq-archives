I used the best available to me, at 3rd I believe I may have had a Bronze 2
Handed Sword.
Ratio under 20th is missleading, 44/60 may as well be a 16/60 (and less
under 10th) which is the reason I balked at all the twinks with their
Wurmslayers at 6th level.

Then I believe you are an idiot.

I would rather kill the mob and live than get a few extra skill raises and
"newbie gate" to bind point
Or do you expect a group to carry you.

Not with 3/19 weapons it won't and short of some serious Power Levelling (or
twinking) I'd be amazed if you could get to 13 from 3rd in anything close to
that time with decent weapons.
