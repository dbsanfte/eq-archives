At 51st level, doing LDoN's, my mage causes about 66% of the damage with 
two nukes, not counting the additional damage from the pet.

I can't always keep up at that rate, depending on the overall pull rate 
and the speed at which the remaining (or more usually first) 33% of 
damage is done, so often nuke only once per mob.

With two mages, or mage and wizard, or two wizards, the LDoN mobs drop 
like flies.  My wizard and a mage in another group basically agreed to 
nuke only once each, because we were wasting mana dropping a second nuke 
every now and then.

It's nice to play a wizard or mage again who can do that % of mob damage 
with a small number of spells, because in the planes it's a totally 
different story.
