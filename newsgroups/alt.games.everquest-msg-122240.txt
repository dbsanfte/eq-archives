  No, I don't believe so.  I think Verant has purposefully limited the
amount of automation their client provides to make the sort of thing that
you want to do more difficult.

  Though since they've decided to start blatently attempting to get people
to create multiple accounts and now seem to encourage "multi-botting", maybe
they'll add more advanced scripting features when they implement the user
interface changes that are on the horizon.
