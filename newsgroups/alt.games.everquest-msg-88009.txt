Did all that.  I'm familiar enough with the guild to know who the guild
leader is, but I don't know who the officers are.   I sent a tell to
somebody in the guild who I know to be a fair and nice player, and he was
going to inform me when an officer logged on,  I'd logged onto my wizard
before that happened though

To me thats giving in, allowing myself to be pushed over and bullied into
doing something I don't wanna do.
Velk is a unique zone in how easy it is to solo in a "dungeon", spiders
don't run when low on health, and I can handle 5 mobs with just me playing
my monk and cleric

I deliberatly avoided posting any messages at the time, because I was so
furious I'd have ended up posting a useless swear filled flame
