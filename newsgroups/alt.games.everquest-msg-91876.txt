Luckily, I'm in a field where I don't have to listen to what *stupid*
people say. Instead, I read your posts for that sublime pleasure.

Like you said, "The policy is that they do NOT restore any character
under 6th level for ANY reason". If you were bright, you'd have made a
point to find out what the rules and policies were when you started
playing. And certainly, having discovered them, one would hope you
would have been able to comprehend the simple fact that no matter
what, you shouldn't expect the GMs to break policy, nor whine about it
when they won't.
