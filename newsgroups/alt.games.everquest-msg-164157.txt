A part of this definition is simply inane. To call it racism, to ' believe
race accounts for differences in human..ability ' is silly.

There is no doubt there are human attributes and abilities which are 
racial specific and / or present to varying degrees along racial lines.

Different races have different physical attributes which are the 
determinant of specific abilities dependent upon those characteristics.

For example, speed is, all other things being equal [ ie not comparing 
a 400 lb person to a 150 pound person ] dependent upon the relationship 
of the length of the arch bone in the foot to the achilles tendon.

Blacks have a more favorable relationship and therefore are as a race, 
faster than other races.

We live in times which the pc movement has intimidated people to even 
consider racial differences exist. Universities, once the bastions of free 
speech, thought and investigation, have become prisons of conformity 
and denial locking people in, and thought out.
