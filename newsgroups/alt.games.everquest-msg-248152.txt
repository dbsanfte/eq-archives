Have at least one Invuln. spell up (eg. Divine Aura) if not both if you want
a chance to survive.... I use it at least once during a raid.  Mainly from
aggro gained during a CH when the tank didn't have enough aggro yet or
healing aggro from an add.

Generally, I'd only use the two single target stuns as the lesser one's get
resisted too much.

However, if you and the pally get co-ordinated properly you might have some
luck at chain stunning together.... however I wouldn't count on it and
remember healing is your primary objective.
