Though the griefer obviously was not getting any xp, he did gain from
killing these greenies. The belts may well have been for his own
faction work in FP. Hard to blame him for that. You face the same
situation when gathering trade skill components.

What I *do* have a problem with, however, is his insistence that it is
ok for him to monopolize two distinctly seperate camps. Technically,
sure, you can run up and take mobs from someone else's camp (provided
the mobs you take are not actively engaged by anyone at that moment),
and VI does not recognize camps per se, but killing one that the
newbie was fighting is definitely inexcusable and subject to action by
a GM.

The jerks are out there, and some of them are *really big* jerks. It
is not indicative of the majority, though. You just have to take the
bad with the good.
