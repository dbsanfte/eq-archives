When I say a long time... I mean more than an hour... worth paying
decent PP for the buff.

Ok we have the standard:

Cleric:
Aego / Virtue  HP and AC buff which If I understand correctly is about
3 hours + o - depending on the Focus Gear of caster....

Enchanter:
KEI  Mana Regen, Int and Wis buff which also lasts 3 hours + o -
depending on the Focus Gear of caster....

Shaman:
HoS / FoS (Harnessing of Spirit and Force of Spirit) which are Sta /
Dex / and Agi (not entirely sure on the agi).  lasts from what I
understand about  1. 5 hours  + o - depending on the Focus Gear of
caster....

Druid:
PotG / Pot9s  AC, HP, mana regen buff... no idea how long it lasts...

What else is out there?  any Hastes that last a long time.... 

as I understand  Aego line and PotG line do not stack.  Any other
stacking issues your aware of for these long buffs, please add your
post.
