I'm sure they knew there was a problem, but the *volume* of the
problem wasn't really known. Considering their total customer base,
the number of complaints on their boards represents a relatively small
number. *shrug* Not saying that that shouldn't have caught it sooner.
It should have been... Just sick of the "fake blindness" accusations.
What good would it do them to be lying? True or not, it's not helping
or hurting their image on the matter... I find it a pretty silly
accusation is all.
