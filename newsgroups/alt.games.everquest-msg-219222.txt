Finding Teapray and Lenny 2.0 awake and playing in Gunthak, I ran
my mage over to join them.  Couple days ago I finally went and
picked up a 34 spell I'd forgotten... so once I reached their
spot I used it and summoned a pet... turned out to be a Drogmar,
makes sense as there are some of these wild in the tunnels. 

At any rate, I had a laugh by making Tea think I'd bought my own
drum, and that my mount was behaving oddly indeed; she figured it
out pretty fast of course

Then I borrowed her drum (yay Firiona Vie) and summoned a real
lizard mount for myself, spent the rest of the time there with
two drogmar.

But thats not the point of this post, what I was wondering is,
other than the amusement factor, is there any real utility to
this spell line?

If, as I suspect, its just summoning a random one of my normal
pets with an illusion of a mob in the zone, well, I suppose its
fun and all, but really its a waste of time as I could be
summoning the precise pet I want.

Worse, if the focus items don't effect it, I'll actually be worse
off.

Since I'm 38 now, I won't have long before I get the 39 pets, at
which point I'm sure a 34 summon won't be something I'll do much,
so if there -is- some potential advantage to the Summon Monster
line I'd better find out quick.

Splendid One, 38 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
