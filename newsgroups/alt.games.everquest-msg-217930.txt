The criticism and the "vision" were both valid. The vision was the game
should be a challenge, with a risk/reward system that included a high
degree of dificulty. Unfortunalty, the original cast made the mistake of
making difficult == tedious.

If current trends continue I am afraid the EQ will become a 3D version
