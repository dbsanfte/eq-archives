What level are you?  If you are fighting in Crushbone still, I would spend
some money on banded.  Nothing fancy, but a full set will give you good ac
into your upper 20's.  Keep selling those CB belts and eventually, the pp
will add up.  Take a trip to EC Tunnel and just watch the auctions for a
while, maybe over a few trips there.  Get an idea of what is out there and
prices and buy what you can afford and like.  You won't be poor forever.
Good luck.
