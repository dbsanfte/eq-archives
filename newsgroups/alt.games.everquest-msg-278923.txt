I'm wondering what everybody's opinion on the second adventure pack is?
 So far, I am really enjoying it.

I've spent some time in there with my alt - right now he is a 28 conj.
The zone definately seems beatable at that level while solo, and it is
giving me a lot of practice using my pet to keep agro (until I start
AE'ing everything :)).  Seems like a good place to learn your class.
I'm pretty sure I would be able to take it if I didn't keep getting
interrupted :P

I've only been in there once with my main (50 assassin).  I wasn't able
to spend much time in there (only able the inactive transporter and one
group beyond).  The groups with more than one caster are definately a
pain, but the interrupt helps a lot... it'd be a lot easier if it was
on a shorter than 10sec timer though ;)

The zone seems well done, I like the twisting caves and narrow
passages.  There is a generous amount of loot, and so far my lowbie has
managed to get just over a gold from chests alone.  I really like how
it scales to your level.  I went into the Bloodlines zone for the first
time when it wasn't all gray and it surprised me how challenging it
really was.  When I went in with my main, I just blitzed through it.
It is really cool to be able to clear it with both characters, even
with such a large level differential.

Has anybody else tried it out?  Any other opinions on it?
