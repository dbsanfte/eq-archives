That's about the time you can think of moving to the Goo area. Seriously
harder fights, and the strategy to break the spawn correctly is
critical, but once broken there's xp that would take you to fifty if you
were stubborn enough to stay that long. However, at that level, you
could also take the temp area to the right as you come through the gate
and not worry about it greening out for some time. Man, I love that
zone. I can't say enough good things about it. For people in their early
to mid forties, CoM is just one of the best and most underutilized
dungeons in the game.
