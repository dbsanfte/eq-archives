    When I was your level I was soloing the hallway to dead side in Lower
Guk. Mobs are fairly easy, there's plenty of room to move around if you pull
them down to where the live frogs are (left instead of right at the
intersection), and it left me available for a group in what was then a
fairly busy zone. If Lower Guk is still used on your server by pickup XP
groups, you might want to try a change of location.
