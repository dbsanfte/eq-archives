On the blue servers, probably none. But this has been a real exploit in PvP, where
someone would powerlevel to, say 20th, then let themselves get knocked back down to
10th. They can now attack players level 6 through 14, but they are doing so with the
skills of someone at 20th level (ie, Offense 105, 1HS 105, etc) and able to wipe the
floor of even 14th level players. Sort of unfair.

I think that, originally, this was by design and not a bug. Since I have several
characters who are active trade skillers, though, with LOTS of stuff both on me and
in the bank (already, 4 brute hides for halfling cultural. WOO HOO!), this will be a
tremendous help in shifting things in and out. My next suggested improvement would
be... can I have THREE containers open at a time?

I don't think they are so much adding a new favorable faction as reinstating one
that they had removed a while back. Allakhazam's consider listing
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/eq_consider.html) lists a "fondly" message that was
apparently removed; I expect that "alliance" is merely taking its place.

As for quests... it rather makes sense that some high end quests would require
something higher than merely amiable. I have several characters who are already
warmly regarded by the Qeynos Guards (can you say 'gnolls'?) It will be interesting
to see what happens when the patch becomes live. Would an alliance with the guards
screw my faction with the Corrupt Guards?
