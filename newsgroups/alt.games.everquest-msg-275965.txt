*** Update Message - 03/03/05 ***
---------------------------------

*** Bazaar & Barter Zone ***
---------------------------------
We have made the Bazaar zone free for everyone.

In addition to this, we have consolidated the Barter zone and the Bazaar 
zone into one hybrid zone, which uses the existing Bazaar zone. You will now 
be able to activate both the /buyer commands and the /trader commands in the 
Bazaar zone. In addition to this change, we have made a few other changes 
for your convenience.

- Removed the zone line from the Bazaar to the Barter zone.
- Added a zone-line from the Bazaar to the Plane of Knowledge.
- The Barter zone entrance in the Plane of Knowledge will now teleport you 
to the Bazaar zone.

- Barter search on Firiona should not filter the NODROP items that aren't 
NODROP on Firiona.
- Right-clicking on a merchant-name in the UI will now create a find-path to 
the merchant.
- Right-click in the Bazaar / Barter search now closes your current find 
path, and if the timer has expired, generates a new find path to the Buyer / 
Trader indicated on the line which was right-clicked.
- The map has been updated with more information, specifically which areas 
of the zone allow you to be a /buyer and which allow you to be a /trader.

The Barter zone is still active, so those of you who are camped out in the 
zone will be able to log in just fine, though you will want to migrate to 
the Bazaar in order to set up your buyer. Please make sure that you are not 
weighed down with coin and items before leaving the zone, or you may find 
yourself unable to move.



*** Spell & Skill Changes ***
---------------------------------
- Moved the contact abilities on spells Spirit of the Leopard and Spirit of 
the Panther to avoid a stacking conflict with the berserker epic effect.
- Monk Return Kick and Double Riposte AAs can now be triggered on the same 
attack.
- Combat abilities will now always hit creatures that require magical 
weapons.
- The Berserker ability Rage of Volley has been modified so that it will hit 
magic required NPCs regardless of the axe that's equipped.
- Increased the charges on the items summoned by Molten Orb and Lava Orb 
from 3 to 10, and increased the mana cost on the spells that summon them.
- Summoned Lava Orbs, Molten Orbs, Shadow Orbs, and Soul Orbs are now no 
drop on the Firiona Vie server.
- The recourse effect of the shadow knight epic 1.5 and 2.0 effects should 
now go to the short duration buff box.
- The monk 1.5 and 2.0 effects will now heal for approximately as many hit 
points as the buff adds to your maximum hit points.



*** Item changes ***
---------------------------------
- The following items have been made No-Drop:
 Potted Dark Lady
 Ancient Tooth of Archanalia
 Scrap of Dark Cloth
 Deformed Dragon Embryo
 Silvery Dragon Scale Fragments
 Golden Dragon Scale Fragments
 Metallic Dragon Shell Fragments
 Ruined Dragon egg
 Desiccated Drake Corpse
 Shattered Draconic Symbol
 Dark Dragon Scale
 Cracked Lavaspinner Egg
 Fragments of Zebeker's Bone Chips
 Black Wing Drake Talons
 Egg of a Saved Clutch
 Frothing Drake Blood
 Mottled Goblin Meat
 Lavaspinner's Silk
- The crystals used as points for Norrath's Keepers and Dark Reign are once 
again tradeable on all servers.
- Hammer of Delusions effect has been changed to Euphoria.
- Shadow Orb can now be in a stack of 5.
- Chests in Skyfire for the Veeshan's Peak access quests should now be 
available for 30 minutes after being dropped by the defeated NPC.
- Harbinger Spire Blueprints now drop more often.
- Stone of Marking will no longer be used if a player can not bind in that 
area.



*** Quests, Missions & Events ***
---------------------------------
- Added a quest to Corrigan Hawthorne in the Bazaar to award PvP points for 
legacy Sullon Zek insignias.
- Decreased difficulty of the Megalodon encounter in Lake Rathe.
- NPCs will now offer you missions based on your average group level rather 
than the level of the player requesting the mission.
- Added a fix for the problem of a player in the process of zoning when the 
mission is completed not being given the reward; when finished zoning he 
will then receive the reward.
- We've changed the way that corpse lock works when an NPC is killed by 
someone in a shared task. You should no longer see corpses locked to a 
shared task when you are killing NPCs not related to a shared task.



*** Tradeskills ***
---------------------------------
- The trivial values of many tradeskill recipes have been modified, please 
make sure to check your recipe lists.
- The Dragons of Norrath Tradeskill Quest NPC's will now accurately 
recognize your ability to wear the armor they're helping you craft.



*** Email ***
---------------------------------
- We will now be using the mail system to send players notifications.  The 
first use of this is with the messages you get when you reach certain 
levels.
- Mail composition window gives focus to the first empty field (To, Subject, 
Msg, in that order).
- The delete action now reselects the position of the first item in the 
deleted selection. Same for undelete.
- Players may now map a key to toggle the display of the mail window.



*** Guild Hall ***
---------------------------------
- You can now assign guild banker status even if the guild member is not 
online.
- The merchant music will stop when you close the guild bank window now.
- Guild bank lists are now sortable (note that the permissions field sorts 
by permission type from most public to least public and vice versa, not 
alphabetically)
- If you logged out in the guild hall, it will no longer send you to last 
your adventure/expedition zone in point.



*** Miscellaneous ***
---------------------------------
- Guild masters will once again allow you to get started with your training 
in Research, Alchemy, Poison Making, and Tinkering.
- Hastening of the Aneuk had a typo in the name.  Anuek has been changed to 
Aneuk.
- The boats in East Cabilis should look like boats again.
- The Bandolier and Potion Belt window shortcuts/binding will now save 
properly.
- The map window will properly tint the map area again on the map tab.
- We've made significant changes to the fog and rain settings in all 
original EverQuest zones.  Visibility should be greatly improved in many of 
these zones and rain will generally be more infrequent.  Seasonal changes 
from rain to snow have also been incorporated into these zones as 
appropriate. In addition, we've increased the visibility in all zones when 
it is raining or snowing.
- Added a new command, /tasktimers, which will display a list of shared 
tasks and how long you must wait before you can undertake that shared task 
again.  This will be incorporated into the task window in the near future 
but we wanted to make the functionality available to players as soon as 
possible.
- Fixed the bug where players would appear with someone else's pet after 
zoning.
- Fixed an issue where a Link Dead player is killed, the killer will no 
longer be able to loot an item.

*** Zek Movelog ***
---------------------------------
- Zek players will now be able to begin the process of selecting a new 
server to have all characters on their account moved to.

Those Zek players who have already executed the /movelog command will be 
moved to the server they chose, unless that server was Solusek Ro or Kane 
Bayle.  Zek players who chose either of these servers will need to execute 
the command again, choosing a new server.

If you have changed your mind as to which server you would like to move to, 
the /movelog UI (after Thursdays update) will have a disregard button. 
Using the disregard button will cancel any pending movelog requests and 
allow you to execute a new movelog request.

We will begin processing the movelog requests on Friday night (March 4th) 
and will continue nightly for a period of 30 days.  Any accounts that have 
executed the movelog request will need to make certain they have no corpses 
in the world.  If you have a shared bank already in use on your destination 
server, you will need to empty either shared bank out as only one will be 
available after the movelog is complete.
