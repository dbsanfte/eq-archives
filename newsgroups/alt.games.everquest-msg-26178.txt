This is called "multiquesting" and works fine to get the Barkeepers
Compendium from Gregor Nasin.  I've done it.

It also works to get the honey jum from Kizzie Mintop.  Sometimes someone
will have turned in one or more honeycomb but will not have forked over
the cash.  So I often hand her the 30 gold pieces first and then
hand over the honeycomb one at a time.  If you hand her all at once,
you'll often see some "is this all, I need more" responses.  That's
your clue that she was already holding extra honey comb.  The
number of responses you get is the number of comb she was holding.
(And now she's holding your comb instead).

Upon more than one occasion, I've seen her "is this all, I need more"
response and cursed myself for handing over more than I had to.  Then,
an hour later, I'll be back after completing a lap and she'll still
have the excess comb.  I then chuckle gleefully to myself and turn
in just enough to get the honey jum.
