Hmm.. well 90% of the people I talk to in the game disagree with you. And
compared to EQ and AC and UO.. hmmm, well their IS no comparison.

I have been playing beta for a while now, and so far it has EVERY rpg game
beat that I have tried, and I have tried about 6.

In the last two weeks that I have played the beta, I have had ONE crash -
how many other games can say that - even long established games?
