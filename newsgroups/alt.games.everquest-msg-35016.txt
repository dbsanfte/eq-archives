I'd leave the guild.  Inviting new members without running it by the
guild to see if anyone has a problem with the person is one thing.
Inviting new members without at least checking with other officers
is another.  Failing to check with the nominal second in command?

What good is being a member of a guild that will let people in
willy nilly, without checking on the opinions of the members?

I can think of several people I will never group with... and a
guild is like being permanently grouped with someone, while
having the added factor of a tag next to my name that
automatically associates me with their actions.

Whether this individual should be in the guild is subject to debate.
I'd be more worried about your recruiting policies, if I were you.
