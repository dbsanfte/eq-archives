It's a level xx Necromancer skill.  Aside from levitation, it also raises 
your poison resistance, and gives you enduring breath (you won't drown 
under water or in a vacuum).

Largely the only thing you will get is some more areas to see.  Of the 
other expansions, only Shadows of Luclin has areas that you could do 
anything in over and above the trilogy.  Once you hit level 20 or so, 
Lost Dungeons of Norrath will add some dungeons that you must group to 
use, and the ability to purchase gear with points earned in those 
dungeons.  Legacy of Ykesha adds a charm slot, so you can have one more 
item worn that can increase your stats.  There are various other features 
added with other expansions, but, you can largely get by without them for 
some time, as you will not be able to play in the zones that those other 
expansions add.

I don't have statistics, but, yes, I would guess that the population is 
predominately male, including many of the female characters.
