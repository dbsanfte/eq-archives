What? I'm not familiar with a phrasing like "How do you take your EQ?"
What do you mean?

Everquest has nothing to do with JRR Tolkien, except he single
handedly made the fantasy genre more mainstream. There were even
stories around before Lord of the Rings, Conan predates it by quite a
number of years (in serialized magazine form, later made into books)
as  what could be called "Modern Fantasy."

EQ has more in common with text muds, such as Diku mud, than with
Tolkien. Its a very similar design except the setting is a 3d
graphical world instead of text.
