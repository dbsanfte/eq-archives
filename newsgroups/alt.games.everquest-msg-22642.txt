I did this a bit when I was doing some quests that required a lot of
travel and I didn't want to bug my druid/wizard friends too much.

Bind in the evil outpost (Oasis for a caster, it's closer to S Ro for
when you need a real 'port.  Also, it's a longer run in TD but the rafts
come more often).  If possible, get a Levitate and SoW just before
boarding the boat.  It's going to be very boring to swim at normal
speed.  Depending on your cash availablity, Lev and SoW potions
might work for you.  Some destinations may have KOS wandering guards, so
be careful if you can't zone invisibly.

With Lev and SoW, average time to the pots from Oasis or Overthere is
probably about 20-25 minutes, including waiting for the boat.  It's very
handy for old-world travel, but only goes to Cabilis in Kunark and nowhere
in Velious.  For most transportation needs (i.e. when you're not on a
quest that takes you all over), it's easier to make friends with (and/or
donate money to) druids and wizards.

When you zone in, head due south until you pass the raptor island, then
southwest (southeast if you're coming from Oasis).  The room is at about
-12000, 4200 and you'll see the top of wizard spires coming out of the
water.  swim down and into the tunnel.  you'll drop into air.

the pots go.
