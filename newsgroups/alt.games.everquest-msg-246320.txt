Goodness, yes.  I haven't teamed with a double-digit level tanker yet.
Everyone is a blaster.

I can understand why, because just standing there going toe-to-toe with a
mob isn't as fun as blasting them and their friends from a distance.
However, my EQ experience leads me to believe that a tanker that can hold
aggro will be invaluable at higher levels.

So I made a tanker and took what I thought to be the most important tanking
abilities.  I'm not yet certain that I'll switch over to the tanker - I
really don't have the time to be developing two different characters in
CoH - but I do find the tanker to be not unpleasant.  He does mitigate
damage pretty well and it's fun to pound someone and send them flying.  =)

We will indeed have to see how well your controller and my tanker play
together.  My feeling is that if you can keep the mobs mezzed while I pound
them into submission one by one, we'll do all right.  I just got Taunt and
am experimenting with using it as a pulling weapon - you can actually Taunt
mobs from a pretty fair distance.
