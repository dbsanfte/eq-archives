DPS is a function of the ratio of the weapons, assuming the same skill,
same handed-ness and no procs.

36 / 40 is 0.9 damage per unit of delay.
32 / 36 is 0.888 damage per unit of delay.

So, 36/40 is actually the slightly better ratio, but by a small margin.

Which probably tips the balance in favour of the 32/36 weapon.

There are other factors to take into account, but in general, the higher
the ratio, or the higher the damage per unit of delay, the more DPS a
weapon will deliver.

10 dmg / 20 delay = 0.5 damage per unit of time
20 dmg / 20 delay = 1.0 damage per unit of time (a 1:1 ratio)
30 dmg / 20 delay = 1.5 damage per unit of time

Depending on your class, don't forget that the higher the ratio the more
aggro each potential swing delivers.
