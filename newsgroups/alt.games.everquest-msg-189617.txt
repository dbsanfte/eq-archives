Look for things small, round and smelly...called halflings.
Kill them.
This will get you Neriak Outer gaurd faction.
As an Ogre you should be relatively safe in Neriak BUT if you didn't choose
Inny as your Deity then the Warrior, Cleric and SK/Necro will not like you
too much.

If you an safely move thru Neriak Commons and 3rd Gate then make your way to
the library with a back full of red wine...give this (1 in each slot) to the
guy in the side room (Lokar To'biath) and you'll get improved factions with
both in and outer dread guard as well as the Merchants there.

To get faction with the Warrior Guild you can kill Wood Elves on their
outpost in Tim. Deep...To get faction with The Dead (SK/Necro Guild) you can
kill the High Elf casters that hang around the Wizard pyramid or you can,
erm...Kill Indigo Brotherhood <shrug>

There are Followers of Rodcet Nife in Nektulos but do not bother with them
for faction in Neriak, they will only hurt your faction in Qeynos.
