I just want to emphasize that this is *not* a picture of Sam Deathwalker's
setup.  Sam Deathwalker is an amazingly disfunctional individual with a
Furor fixation who plays on Sullon Zek.

The guy in this picture is a nice German who goes by the name of his main
character, Gomorrha.  He plays on Drinal and is unobtrusive and polite.

Just don't want people confusing the two, because even though they're both
six-boxers, that's about where the comparison ends.  Gomorrha doesn't
deserve to get hit with Sam's rep.  Gomo's a nice guy.  =)
