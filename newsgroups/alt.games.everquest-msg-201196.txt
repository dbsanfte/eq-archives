Yep. People have to learn to speak up. 
First, find out what the arrangements are. If you don't like them, try
to change them. If they change, then you are ahead. If they don't, then
you have to make a basic decision; stay or leave.

I see this happening all the time in various groups all over the place
(well classic EQ anyway). Some leave, someone enters & "what's looting".
Often it changes. I've been in a group and seen "ffa, rotate, turn off
split, ml[1], don't want any, all yours" all within an hour.

Everyone groups for different reasons;
	
	Some for experience,
	Some for plat,
	Some for runes,
	Some for words,
	Some for weapons,
	Some for quest items,
	Some for trade skill supplies (ore, rusties, etc),
	some to releave boredom.

The only people who know about his spell requirements are those who have
played his class to that level. My guess is that a lot of people have no
ideas of the requirements of many classes. So unless he speaks up, it
will remain that way.

Yes, I have seen people ask other characters "are you getting enough
loot to cover blah". Some people are worried about their cash flow,
others are happy to trade for exp or other.

It all comes down to negotiating, which is part of being in a group.


[1] FFA is free for all. ML is main looter who does all looting, sells
it and does
/split pp gp sp cp   for sharing.
