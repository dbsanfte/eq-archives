If it's really the case that a pet can't be taunted off to a different mob,
then I would suggest that the beastlord have a hot key called attack that does
the following.

/pet attack
/attack on

That way, when ever he attacks a target, his pet goes in with him
*on the same bloody target*.  Let them know that by using a keyboard
option, they can use the same key that they are used to using to start
attacks - (like 'a', or numeric pad enter, or whatever)

If a beastlord pet can be taunted off.  Then I'd say the beastlord
needs another hot key that he presses all the time during the fight:

/pet attack

That way he stays on the beastlord's target most of the time.

In addition, I'd say that someone needs to complain to Verant that this
is a major pain to have the pet tauntable.
