Useful to know, thank you, I was not aware of that, now I don't have to go
into half-screen mode nearly as often.

(still will have to for the filter options for raid prep, but that's not
half as common as clip plane adjusting; yeah, I know there's some console
commands for it but I'd rather just hit f10 2 times than remember a buttload
of commands)
