Druids can also find themselves in the position where they are the
primary healer of a group, where their not paying attention can get a
group member killed, and where they have to take command of a party.
Clerics are NOT necessarily very hard to play.
A druidic healer will get heals later than a cleric, never get
complete heal, and not get as good AC/HP buffs as a cleric. A druidic
healer will instead get regeneration spells, strength buffs, and
damage shields.

True: There are many more druids than clerics. However, nobody knows
if the percentage of good clerics is higher than the percentage of
good grouping druids - bad grouping druids can go solo instead, and
bad clerics can usually get away with it, since clerics are 'needed'
and an otherwise good group won't need them to do more than heal and
buff..

Clerics can't really solo but they CAN beat their way out of a paper
sack. They have superior AC/HP buffs, much better armor than druids,
and the same 1hb/2hb skills as a druid. A cleric who really wants to
can even learn how to melee without endangering the group or wasting
time not medding - ask Lance :)
