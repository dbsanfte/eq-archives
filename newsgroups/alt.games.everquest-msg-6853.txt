    The quest isn't in Velious. The warrior guildmaster in Kelethin wants
four shark meats. The food vendor in Thurgadain sold shark meat as a stock
item. The quest reward was fairly significant XP and coin/items worth a plat
or two.

    The figures I've seen were 400 to 500 plat per hour of doing the quest,
assuming a port-capable character, and enough XP to ding a character from
barely 23 to a bub or two into 24 in one trip. Assuming all ten slot packs,
all but one inventory slot filled with meats. (The quest giver gives a
combinable box for the meat.)

    BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Oh, sorry. Ahem.

    Every patch is FILLED with items that go in and aren't mentioned. Most
web boards have threads devoted to "what did they nerf now?" after a patch,
just listing undocumented changes. Since the "no destroy on combine" patch,
I imagine things have gotten worse. The tradeskills community is beginning
to discover a TON of undocumented recipes. I imagine this will be the model
for tradeskills from now on - no documentation, just put it in game and let
players experiment to find it. After all, if you don't say a recipe is in
game nobody can call you an idiot if you didn't patch in all of the
ingredients. Or the recipe itself. :-/

    On a related tangent, I wonder if the Fleeting Quiver was put in game
today, what with the quiver changes. It would be a welcome bridge from 130
to the Velious stuff if he did the skill level right.
