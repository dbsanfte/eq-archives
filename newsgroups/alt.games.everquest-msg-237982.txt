I think he is overestimating the effect of EQ's expansions.  I find that
there is too big a range in geography, monsters, architecture, etc., with
all the expansions, which, for me, makes it seem like they don't really
belong together.  They are more like different games that just happen to use
(mostly) the same ruleset and let me use my existing characters.

Consider the original EQ world.  The was variation, but it somehow all
seemed to fit together in a way that made it seem like one world.  Kunark
and Velious added to that.  They were different, but it just seems to me the
kind of differences one would find in a world.  After that, things seemed
much less coherent.

A similar thing is happening over in DAoC.  The original three realms were
distinct, but somehow all fit together.  The first expansion added to each
realm in much the way Kunark and Velious added to EQ: lots of new stuff, but
it seemed to be a reasonable extension of the old.  The Atlantis expansion,
however, doesn't really fit in with the previous stuff, and so seems to me
kind on unsettling (even though they tried to make the story explain why it
is this way).

Anyway, I think if WoW has a consistent, coherent, design, it can start with
a world a lot smaller than EQ and do fine.
