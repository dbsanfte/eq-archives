Yeah, there was someone on Tunare spamming in BBM /ooc for people to
/feedback that they didn't like it for hours last night. He was
whining because he couldn't get 2kpp per week anymore by mobs that
were deep green to him.

Damn, how horrible. Dwarves can actually do all their newbie quests
now without having to worry about high levels bottomfeeding the mobs
that drop the components for the quests... Tragedy! People actually
have to EARN their plat again rather than scumming newbie mobs for it!
