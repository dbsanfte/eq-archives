"casting temp at the zone in spot in 5 minutes -
click off old aego/virtue"

"casting temp at the zone in in 3 minutes,
click off old aego/virtue"

"casting temp at the zone in in 1 minute,
click off old aego/virtue"

"Casting temp NOW at the zone in, if you haven't
clicked off aego/virtue you'd better pray it lasts
the entire mission, because I aint recasting inside."

I do it with BL buffs vs. shammy buffs, but same
