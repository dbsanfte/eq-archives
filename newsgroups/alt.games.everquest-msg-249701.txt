Hm.  I remember meeting an NPC in FoB outside Kaesora a few months ago,
who offered to bind my soul there.  But I thought you were saying that
players could bind other players in these places, not that there were
soulbinders there.

I checked the gypsy camp tonight and found no NPC who said anything
about binding.  I also looked at the eqatlas guide, and it seems to say
that nobody can bind in Great Divide?  Except I did.  Or is the atlas
guide again talking about players casting bind on other players?

I'm so confused...
