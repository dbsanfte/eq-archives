Uh.  Stacks of Silver and Malachite go for 1g4s per stack with good charisma.  
You can't scrape up 6gp to get to 17 skill? :) When you need to move to 
electrum malachite, the electrum will be ~45pp a stack and your fail rate 
will be fairly bad at first.  That's the only expensive lump before 54. Well, 
and amber is the same 45pp/stack, but your success rate will be better at the 
silver amber stage.

Uh.  There's your problem.  Switch to -much- cheaper electrum malachite 
(triv 74) and eat some fails.  Even though it's 20 points higher, you should 
still have a 50% success rate at that point.  And I'd rather fail 40 
electrum malachite combines in a row (net cost ~100pp) than fail -one- 
sapphire combine, because then at least I got 40 chances to skill up.

Yes, the chance of skilling up on a failure is worse.  The question is, is it 
20-odd times worse?  No, more like half as good. :)
