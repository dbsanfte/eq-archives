    Bit much for what? Did it break the game somehow? Unless they stated
somewhere that they were going to change this, this'll cause people who got
the ability believing it was working as intended to get pretty upset.

    Good. It means stuff can be taunted, charmed, and mezzed that couldn't
be before.

    Problem: mobs are piling up in a certain spot in the zone, or are
falling beneath the world.
    Bug: mobs are taking a long route to get somewhere, but still get there.
    Exploit: there's a "safe spot" mobs can't path to.

    That's how I'd read it, anyways.

    Hold that woot. This quest is even more annoying than the last one.

    A lot of these recipes will likely be "intermediate products" recipes,
like making padding, or will be "small/medium/large" versions of recipes.
The Eighth Shawl has a whole bunch of new recipes in it, too.

    Cats, like lions perhaps?
