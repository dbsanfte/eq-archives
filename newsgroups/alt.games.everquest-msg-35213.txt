You know, this *can* be a problem.

Example: last night I started a new character.  Almost at once a guy 
started twinking her.  And twinking her.  And twinking her.  I thanked 
him profusely every time and what I couldn't use, I passed on to a *real* 
newbie who I'd taught about sewing kits a bit earlier.  Then all of a 
sudden he starts acting *very* friendly, asking for kisses for his items, 
and before he camps out for the night, did some emote where he gently 
kissed my character.

Now, this is a big enough problem if you *are* straight, but *damn*.  
What exactly do I say to this guy?  I decided if he kept it up I might 
end up deleting the character, because I really don't see a way to tell 
him to back off without getting him all offended.

I've experienced this only a couple of times and it's a *highly* 
uncomfortable situation to be in.  Not only is the very thought of a guy 
*kissing* me disgusting, but on top of that, it's a complete stranger who 
thinks that giving me a couple of pieces of patchwork qualifies him to 
start pawing my digital self.  Thanks, but I'm not *that* desperate for 
AC. :p
