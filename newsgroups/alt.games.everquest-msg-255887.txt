I like that.  But now I gotta do the math on my buffs!

Most 60+ buffs don't seem to have the varying-by-level durations.

Base duration of KEI is 150 minutes.  So that 5% is worth 7.5 minutes.
And my KEI is 255 minutes! Whee. :)  How much buff extension that is is 
left as an exercise for the reader. :)

Of course, the counterpoint is, if we just list the duration, everyone 
will have to do the math to work out what degree of buff extension that 
is, since they're all used to thinking of it that way. :)

If you have two competing vendors, and one is offering 120 minute VoQ and 
the other has 45% extended, who do you go to?
