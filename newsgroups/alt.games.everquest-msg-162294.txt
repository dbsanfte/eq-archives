Even though Janice is a top poster, it's one of the last responces to
that thread I started and I guess I really phrased the question badly.

I already know pretty thoroughly what a DKP system is in general, the
theory behind it, etc.  What I was looking for were the *specfics* of
point values that had been assigned by guild who had working systems.

It's all well and good to say "We give points for every raid you attend
and you spend them when items drop."

I'm just wondering if any guilds had publicly available web resources,
etc. detailing how many DKP's you earn if you clear Fear, how many for a
Kunark Dragon, a Velious Dragon, etc. etc. and a listing of how many
DKP's they charge at a minimum (if they do) for the various good loot
items on the respective mobs.
