For several hundred years the majority of earth's civilization thought
it was flat.  There were a few who believed otherwise but had no
"scientific evidence" to prove it.

I believe homosexuality will prove to be some form of abnormality in
the human animal, whether it be chemical, hormonal, or dna.  Will I
see it proven in my lifetime?  Maybe, maybe not.  But I believe it
will be proven all the same.

Just because there is no "scientific evidence" (which I argue anyway)
does not mean it isn't true.  You can't see oxygen, and yet it is
there.

Anyway, no one on this thread will change their opinion because of
anything posted here (definition of bigotry by the way, so we're all
bigots) so I'm finished.  Everyone will think what they will and
that's their right.
