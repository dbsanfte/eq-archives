If you're after the big ticket research components (lvl 60 spells),
you won't be able to get them duoing at your lvl. Nobles camp in
Veksar is one of the best spots for them since a decent percentage of
the mobs are over 60th lvl. Be prepared to deal with mobs that
Harmtouch for 1k and hit for close to 500 though. 

I think the easiest place to hunt those components is ChardokB (if
it's still open). Not only can you get the spells there (seen
Sunstrike and Torpor drop) but all of the components seem to be on the
drop table. You can hunt the zone line there since many of the named
are random spawns. Don't recall how tough those mobs are but my shaman
never had any trouble soloing there.
