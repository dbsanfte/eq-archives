im so broke in everquest it sucks. i see all the people that are the same
lvl as me selling and bying stuff for over 100pp and i wonder how they do
it. the someone tells me about trade skill and how they make stuff and then
sell it. ofcorse dumb me i only have 1 point to spend at training and i have
no idea what to make or how to make it to raise my skill. so if anyone has
some good ideas on how i could make stuff to sell for some pp or knows of a
guide it would be cool if you could send it my way. im a 14 lvl wood elf
ranger and still trying to learn stuff. thanks
