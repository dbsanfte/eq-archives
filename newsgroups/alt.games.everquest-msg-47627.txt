I am sure the server makes a difference but I would buy up one in a
heartbeat (if I didnt have one already - LORE) at that price on MT
(and most servers I would imagine).  Even though MT's prices are doing
a skydive it seems right now, it is hard to beat that ratio.  On MT
they are still selling for 1k to 1500.  I paid 1750 for mine about 4
months ago when 3k was closer to the norm.  I love mine.
