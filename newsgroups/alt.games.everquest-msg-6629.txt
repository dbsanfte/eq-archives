One of the main reasons for the Lake being so popular is that it is
considered a newbie zone, so creatures have a modifier to xp.  So if I kill
9 level 20 creatures in LOIO you'd need to kill 10 level 20 creatures in OT
to get the same xp.  Also the Sarnak fort is a nice steady supply of mobs to
kill, with predictable behavior.

I'm not say either is better, but thats why (in my opinion) more people hunt
the lake.

(also, the dragoons scare away the light folks)
