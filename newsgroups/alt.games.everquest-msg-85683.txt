At 52 I still rarely use complete heal, I'm a celestial heal type of
healer.  Sure the tank has 3000 hitpoints. Just toss a Cel Heal on him
at 80 percent, he'll be full when fight over. 

Warriors don't gripe about as much as they used to.Used to get upset
if you didn't wait for them to "beserk" or whatever so they can get a
few extra hits.  wah wah.  Its not worth the aggrivation for me, I'd
rather have everyone at full health and sitting on my ass than have a
tank at 30% when get 2 adds.

Of course if I'm grouped with a couple level 60 warriors, its a
different story.

But for xp grind, basic zones (karnors, dreadlands, velks etc), its
celes heal all the way. Remedy on the chanter, followed by a celes
then another rem or superior.

One final note. Can cast celes heal on a warrior when he at 20 health
and still being pounded on, to "buy some time" and keep him beserk
while the complete is casting.

It all depends on situation
