That's not really an apt comparison.  In the case of the Nigerian scams, 
the victim isn't being asked to do anything illegal.  In fact, the scams 
are usually presented in such a way that the victim thinks they are 
*helping* someone.

In the case of the original poster, he was ripped off while trying to do 
something against the rules of the game.  So, basically, the people he 
choose to ask to help him cheat turned out to not be honest.  He's a 
victim, but he also bears responsibility and the fault lies partly with 
him.
