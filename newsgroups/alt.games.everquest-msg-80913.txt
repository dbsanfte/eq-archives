Sorry, I'm a complete imbecile. I didn't catch your original post, and 
from the reply, I assumed you were talking about a common SoL 
installation bug by which the files would end up installed in the wrong 
directory.

I'm afraid that if you bought the game off-the-shelf, even if it's the 
trilogy, you will have a few minutes/hours of patching, depending on your 
connection speed. This is rather unavoidable, because many files have 
been updated since. Still, the files would be a few megabytes at the 
most, so if you see that the game gets stuck at patching one file for an 
inordinate amount of time, something may be going wrong...

Hopefully by the time you read this the patching will be finished. :)
