Interesting. Loos like Shaman rule solo fights again.
I am a barb shaman who never grouped. I soloed wetalnds monitors at
level 10, they were Blue-up-up con(blue++ group)  to me. They gave me
3-4% exp per fight!!! When you are 15-17 it is not that easy to kill
blue++, but green++ and blue+ are still manageable, though it is a coin
flip in many cases. Orange solo is easy (100% success).
I tried to kill Red-con Great Bear (at level 17 and mob is level 20) it
was a 50-50 situation and I loose this time. Still I believe I had a
chance.
I can see that for Solo target color (white, yello, orange) does not
make big difference in EXP points. It is always about 0.5-0.7%. On the
contrary, Group-con targets give you nice bonus exp (usually 1-2%) and
offten chest drops.

In EQ2 shamans have such a perfect shield spell (Wardens) you may
engage everything.
Heroic is very important too, because it ads additional 30-40% damage
plus very nice short time buffing.
The only problem about soloing is multiple targets. Five or more greens
kill Warden buff very quickly and recast takes too much power.
