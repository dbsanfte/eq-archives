Druid.  He can damage shield you and boost your HP and AC.  Then you
just pull a train and let them beat themselves to death on you.  Smack
each at least once and you get exp from them all.  Higher level
clerics are good at this because they can also cast a fairly effective
damage shield with obviously much better AC/HP boosts.  But this only
works on one MOB per pull, so obviously the druid can help a level
1-20 take 'em down much quicker.  I do this with my ranger all the
time...

The shaman would be best at allowing you to take down a beast that
would otherwise be too tough...slowing it and hasting you.  But you
wouldn't come close to the turnover rate of powerleveling with the
druid.  With the shammy you still have to be the one that does most of
the damage, rather than DS damage, which the game credits to no one.
