From the 20-35 range Death can cost 2-4 hours of fighting to get back to
where you were before dieing after 36 and above can be as much as 10 hours
to get back to where you were. Mainly not being able to solo as much and the
exp loss. The first level after a Hell level you can lose up to a full
yellow bub of exp by dying. I personally pay 50p for a level 39 res and 100p
for a 49 res these are about the going rates. You only have 3 hours of
playing time to get a res on a character and this 3 hours is the account
being logged on not the character that needs the res. You can do a /consent
(players name) to allow someone to drag your corpse if you are unable to get
to your corpse. Most Clerics if not busy will go out of there way a bit to
help and even though there are no Clerics in the zone never hurt to shout
out a plea. The coffins you mentioned are for a summon corpse from a Nec.
This is usually an insureance policy you keep the coffin in the bank and if
you die in a place you cannot get to a Nec can summon your corpse with a
coffin to him anywhere in the zone. Necs also have a means of a rez but very
rare someone a 46and above must sacerfice them selves to create the Gem
needed to do the rez.
