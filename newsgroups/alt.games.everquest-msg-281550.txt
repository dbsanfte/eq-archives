I only get two hours a week to play most weeks, sometimes as much as
four, and the times I do get to play I never see/find any pickup raids.
Ever. I've seen a grand total of one pickup raid in almost two years of
playing, and it was just getting organized as I was logging for the
night.

Pickup groups are rare and far between; I can go the full four hours,
those rare times when I have four hours of consecutive play, and only
ever see "65+ CLASS LFG". When I do get responses to "48 SK LFG" I'm
usually passed on because I'm not geared, so I end up soloing a lot. Or
just duo-ing with the wife who is still soured on guilds and doesn't
like grouping with unknown people.

I'm hoping that, while not PoP or OoW gear, the new DoN cultural armor
crafting will give me something a bit better than the Dreadscale I've
been using :)

At any rate, I find I agree with Faned; it's not unplayable, just
unplesant.

Xiphos - Is there anything worth looting in PoJ? I couldn't find
anything.
