I tried to log in last night, got Error 1001, cannot connect, went away for
20 mins tried again, still nothing, nother 20, still no go. Finally I just
sat pressing enter for 10 mins while reading a book, got in, only to see
<system wide message> zones coming down in fives mins, tried to zone into
Gorge of King Xorbb, LD, so I left.
Today, checked server status, waited til all servers were shown as up on EQ
site, waited another hour, tried to log, Error 1001, waited 20 mins, Error
1001, and so on. been 2 hours, still cant log in.

No point crying about it, but does anyone know the server address for login
so I can run a tracert, just to see. Also, am I the only unable to connect,
or is this wide spread.
BTW, I am in the UK, which may be the prob, but at this point I cannot tell.
