A drumless level 5 Selo's isn't unbalancingly fast, I doubt too many folks
would complain if they had this minor speed boost.  To me, it wouldn't be
any different than an Iksar starting with 100 swimming, and no level based
swimming cap, or an Unstunnable Ogre Warrior, or a regenning troll/iksar, or
a HLF/ELF who can hide and/or sneak.  The skills are cool, but not
unbalancing.
