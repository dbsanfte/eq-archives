What about getting TO North Freeport, to the bank? I'd have a problem there
wouldn't I?  That is my main reason for needing the faction increase.  If it
weren't for the guards along the way, yeah, I could do without the others.
    Though I have ran into certain halflings with questionable naming policy
violations, but don't see the point in /petition Naming polocy violation on
NPC StupidHalflingWhoHatesDarkElfs. So when I get to be bigger, I might
consider some revenge on them, and maybe a certain town as well.
"You Halflings have k3wl d00d your own forest, you will not ruin Nektulos."
/em slashes a halfling for 600 points damage.
"You Halflings tried to take my gold and platinum in EC. You want my metal?
How about some steel...UP CLOSE!"

Where is this NPC? I've got the funds.  I've got 80pp in the bank, about
another 20+ on me, and a HQ Bear pelt I just looted before logging off.  I
wouldn't mind trying it, I only need to get to apprehensive right (just need
banking)?
    I think I can afford the cost for this cause.  I've got a guide to
making 100-150 platinum by LV10.
    Two words. "Player Economy".  Step 1: Find what they want. Step 2: Sell
it to them.

Maybe not choice yet, but see above comment regarding a possible future
choice on my faction standings with "Guards of the Vale", and possible
future choice in baking skill with certain recipes.
    Maybe I've got a sick mind, but what about going invis and walking
around inside Rivervale eating foods made from halfling?  Or give some to
Halfling newbies?
