People obviously don't want to play that, or it would already exist. There's
few games in the world where money makes much of a difference, and none I'm
aware of where the richest always wins. What this looks like is corruption
by stealth; slowly increasing the advantages you can buy, whether it be a
faster car than your competitor in a car race, or better gear in a MMOG.

If people don't object early, then the danger is that they won't have a
choice later, at least for those games run by greedy multinational
corporations.
