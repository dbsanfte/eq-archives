We're a small guild, but we have good players.  2+ groups is all we needed
for the event and a minor CH chain ( I think we had 2 druids and 2 clerics
the last time ) is all you need for the final "named".  It doesn't take that
long to do it, once you're there and buffed, have a shrunk bard do the
pulling ( they can fit thru the bars ) and you can do a slave an hour.  One
of our server's bigger guilds wiped on it with 4 groups the day we decided
to do it, so I don't know if we just have out shit together or they
underestimated the event.

We had several bugs happen to us.  The big one was when we had 2 slaves
left.  We freed one, and then started on the last one and as we were pulling
the VERY LAST MOB ( had already killed the named immediately when the wave
spawned ), the timer from the -previous- slave expired and ended this
attempt.  We were less than happy.  The GMs gave us the spawn pieces back
( which we didn't need, we had collected quite a few sets ), but didn't do
anything else.  Grrr.

Good to know, thanks.

I don't know.  I was going to do the hand-ins with my 38 Rogue, but found a
more deserving 57 rogue and let him have the item ( bracer? ).  I don't know
of any lower level people that have tried it.

Thanks for the info,
