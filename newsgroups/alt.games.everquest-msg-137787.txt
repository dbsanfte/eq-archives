    I'd be all over that. My resists are good enough, and my WIS is far
enough above 230 that I could afford to lose the resists on my Lodizal shell
shield to add 75 HPs / 75 MANA in raid situations and get myself away from
the dangerous AGI situation I'm in (now 76, after switch would be 85). Since
I just got a Shield of Ssrawhatever (the FT: VI one) I'm likely a long ways
away from another loot award, so I want to improve myself with the Heiro and
upgrading my Coldain Shawl 6 to Coldain Shawl 8 (another 50 HP / 50 MANA and
mitigation on lost MR going from Lodizal to Heiro). 125 HPs from the two
items would put me over 2600 unbuffed, 4400 in normal raid buff
configuration - a lot of padding for a leadoff CH cleric.
