I haven't played a wizard specifically, but gating (i.e. casting the spell
"Gate") will not remove aggro.  If your bind point is still within the
monster(s) aggro/chase range, they won't skip a beat in resuming the
beating.  The problem then becomes if the mob is naturally aggressive to you
(i.e. goblins), when you are reincarnated at your bind point, if the
monster(s) are still around, they'll kill you again.  And again.  And again.
Always bind in a safe place.
