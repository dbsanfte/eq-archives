No he isn't.  Not as a *person*, he isn't.  His job may well be more
important than your job, but that's another matter entirely.

I'm not sure what that question means.  If you believe that the only
way to do evil is to be aware that the act is evil while you perform
it, then I submit to you that no one ever does evil.  Lokari and DT
are correct to the extent that a person will invariably come up with
some reason why what they are doing isn't evil.  It's called
rationalization, and we're all great at it.

My point is, and has always been, that evil is an illness.  An
insistence upon self to the exclusion and detriment of others.  This
illness has enourmously varying degrees of seriousness; from the point
where it's almost benign, providing a useful amount of "healthy"
self-interest, to the point where it becomes a malignant monstrosity,
as in the case of a Stalin or a Saddam Hussein.  And all the possible
degrees in between those two extremes.

Who was it who wrote somewhere that the essence of Satan at his very
core is pettiness?
