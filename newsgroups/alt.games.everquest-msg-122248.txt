Now how did I overlook that gem? >< Who said anything about *ME* being
a Vah Shir? *snicker* 

I know, I know. I never even said any of my characters were Vah Shir,
or that my name here was one used in game (although, "Darktyger" as a
surname and possibly as a first name would be allowed under the
rules). I do play 2 Vah Shir. I happen to love the race, in fact...
But, that's no surprise to most people who know me. ><

Why is it the bad trolls always end up taking stabs at the name? I'm
still amused by the one who kept calling me "Tygger". I happen to like
Tigger, thankyouverymuch!
