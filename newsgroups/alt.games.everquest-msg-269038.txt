Regarding KS, I cant remember the last time someone tried to KS in EQ1...
maybe a few years ago when I was in a newbie zone. Regardless, those
occurrences are rare, and solved with discussion or simply moving. It's not
enough to justify erecting a "brick wall" around you so nobody can interact
with you when fighting.  The cost is too high.

Regarding PL, who the hell cares if people can PL? That's their choice, and
many enjoy it & consider it a style of gameplay. I'm sure you disagree with
it fully but it doesn't mean your right, and it doesn't mean you need to
erect a "brick wall" around everyone to force them to fight in the same lame
way. Besides, if my friend has fallen a few levels behind me why shouldn't I
be allowed to help him catch up? Because it makes you jealous?  Sad

Regarding BuffBots... are you on crack? I think your talking about DaoC?
Buff "bots" in EQ1 are extremely rare and a bannable offence. I'm sure that
99% of the EQ1 population has never seen a "Buffbot" and never will. It's
certainly no reason to build 'the wall'.


Sorry... the "wall" method has more disadvantages  then advantages. Unless
you like bondage.. and being told what to do....  and being wiped....
pervert....
