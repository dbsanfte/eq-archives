Okay, I let the auto-picker pick my first name, and it was taken, so I 
added a random letter combo onto the end of it - and then realized how 
utterly stupid it sounded about 14 levels in when I started thinking 
"Hum, last name...".  I'm wondering - can you petition to have your first 
name changed?  I hope?  Sadly, I wasn't even planning on playing the 
shaman much. It was just a break from the mage :p
