One thing I'd suggest is look for Strength gear.  It will allow you to hit
for a little more and (more importantly) carry more allowing you to use
heavier armor.

Jagged Bands (5 AC, 3 Str) are nice rings
Bloodstained Mantle (6 ACs, 3 Str, 10 sv Magic)
Spiked Collar (3 AC, 3 Str)

These are all rather cheap items (less then 50pp) which can raise your
strength, allowing you to upgrade to Bronze armor (slightly better then
banded).

The crafted quests are pretty good, but the gems can get expensive.
