Sounds good, but that might provide more "safe" places than Verant wants.
Norrath isn't really the safest place, and by eliminating all of these
buildings as potential havens to med and rest up, the challenge is
increased.

Although, if those walls are strong enough to provide shelter to the
merchants, who knows. I guess it wouldn't change the game all that much.
However, I would think they should still allow semi-sentient creatures, like
orcs, to still be able to "see" you hiding in and be able to open the doors
and come get you. Of course, I would also think that the merchants would
then come to your aid.

Either way, I view it as a necessary, though certainly annoying, evil.
