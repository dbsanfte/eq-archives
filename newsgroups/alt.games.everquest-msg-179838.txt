Robert:

The major difference here is the display adapter.  That Radeon 7500 is
walking all over the Pine card.

IMO, if you're running SoL, both of these systems are quite
underpowered in terms of processor speed and RAM.  I don't hesitate to
recommend a 1GHz processor and 768MB of RAM for SoL.

I played Vellious for six months on a  1.0GHz/ Celeron system with
384MB of RAM.  Then SoL came out and my system slowed to a crawl.
Maxing the motherboard at 768MB RAM and adding a GeForce 4 TI 4600
made things tolerable in all but the busiest zones or groups.

Of course, that display adapter was hitting a hell of a bottleneck
because of the processor speed.  Hurry up and wait ;->

I recently upgraded to a 2.4b GHz P-4  with 1GB PC 2700 DDR RAM and a
RAID-0 IDE array.  I used my 4600 in the new system.

Now, I can finally participate in big guild battles without having to
dumb down my EQ display settings.

Another upside is that I can pop through a zone change really really
fast ;->

Best regards,

Tim ==
