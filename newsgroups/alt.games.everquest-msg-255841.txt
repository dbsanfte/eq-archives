  Hello, I'm hoping someone can point me in the direction of a
couple of fun zones appropriate for my 64th (soon to be 65th)
beastlord and my husband's 65th bard. We may or may not have with us
our friend with his 65th enchanter, a 63rd druid from our guild,  a
64th cleric guildie, or anyone else from our guild who's bored with
planes groups, so anywhere that absolutely requires a traditional
plate-wearing tank /healer /slower setup won't work. We're not
ele-flagged, although we have all expansions, if that helps any.

  I'm not looking for lightning-fast experience or uber loot, just a
break from the usual. My husband and I currently spend quite a bit
of time in Nurga and a bit in Droga since we can mow through all of
Nurga and the easier parts of Droga with no real healer, and we do
LDoNs whenever we can snag enough people, but we'd love a change of
scenery. A good 75% of our guild practically lives in BoT, and they
love the xp, I'd just prefer to find somewhere we have to move
around and use our brains more frequently, and that can be done when
we don't have a healer, even if the xp is quite a bit slower.

  So, any pointers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. We'd
love to see some new places, and even promise to send a postcard =)
