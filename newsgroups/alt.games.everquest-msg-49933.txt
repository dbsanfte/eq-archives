I've seen him killed by one group of 55-60. They took him fairly easy. I
believe he spawns every 18 hours near ToFS in IC. I think Snow feather (or
whatever the named Griff is) spawns every 18 hours as well near the pirates.

You can usually tell when he's about to spawn in IC, a bunch of high levels
generally appear shortly before he spawns. Typically folks from the same
guild. So if you are hunting in IC with 8 people in the zone and then 12
50-60th levels show up, Lodizal is about to spawn.
