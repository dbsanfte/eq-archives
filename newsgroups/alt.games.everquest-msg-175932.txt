Don't spend an arm and a leg on a weapon.  Just go to bazaar and look for
something maybe a little better than what you have.  You won't be using a
weapon for very much longer anyway.  Try to find something to hold in your
hand that gives you intelligence.  I have a lvl 24 Necro that holds a
Harvester which allows her to see invisible.  Before that, she held a Cone
of Mystics which increased her mana and intelligence.
