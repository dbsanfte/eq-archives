I'd suggest you join a group, but tell them first you haven't had much
(any?) experience grouping so they can tell you what they expect... at 27 it
won't be too hard to learn what you're supposed to do... just some basic
rules.

Find out who you're supposed to assist, and make a hotkey that does "/assist
[playername]".  Hit that hotkey whenever the person you're assisting starts
to fight a mob.

Don't pull anything unless you are designated as the puller for the group
(you probably won't be because you're new to grouping).

Stick with the group.  Fight the mob or mobs the group is fighting.  Don't
attack something unless the whole group is with you on that particular mob.

Don't break mez.  If a caster says such-and-such a mob is mezzed, don't
attack it until the other mobs are dead.

Do what the group leader tells you to do.  A group has to have one and only
one leader or it won't work.

Probably a few other rules I'm not thinking of, but those are the basics.

Grouping will be easy for you right now.  I'd suggest you learn to do it now
because as you lvl up it'll be harder and harder to solo.  The longer you
solo, the more out of your league you'll be in any group.  Also, you may
consider grouping with some people who are a few levels below you so you'll
be a good addition to their group even if you're not that experienced.
