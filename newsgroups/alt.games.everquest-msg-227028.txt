That fundamentally misses the point. Even if you have enough sample points
to get a truly even distribution you still dont get the same chance of
winning an item for a given amount of contribution to the guild.

For the warrior who raids 4 times this week, but can only roll once because
only one raid has a warrior drop compared to the warrior who only attends
the raid with the warrior drop the distribution is horribly skewed. This
is not a problem with 'part timers' in the guild; it is a problem with
choosing a loot system that doesnt account for the fact that part timers
are inevitable. Random does not account for contribution; it is in its nature.

This is why very very few guilds use random.

Wrong. Those who participate less only see fewer loots if their participation
is randomly distributed amongst raids loot can drop for them at, which is
rarely the case. Further, saying that a loot methodology that cannot account
for the way people play is not flawed, because people dont play in a manner
that suits it when other systems are available that do account for the
nature of the game seems nonsensical. The problem is the system; it doesnt
fulfill the objective, that of 'fair' loot distribution in the environment
we all play in.

Sony have already explicitly said that the RNG is far streakier than they
would like but evens out over 'sufficient' data points. Given that some
guilds do not raid often at all it is perfectly possible for these streaks
to noticably benefit some at the expense of others.
