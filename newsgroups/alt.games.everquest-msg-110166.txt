Try this:

combine the recipe in the container; just the recipe, not the pattern.

Then, go over to the loom behind the Fool's Gold, put the pattern and
whatever you got from the recipe in and hit combine.

I know the cleric quest works this way. Combine the recipe in the container,
then combine the end result with the mold I get in a forge.

Since you get a pattern, I would say you use the loom, or you could also use
a sewing kit if you have one.
