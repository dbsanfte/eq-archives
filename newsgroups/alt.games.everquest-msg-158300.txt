Well, *I* considered the ability to teleport a class-defining
ability of druids, at least prior to PoP.  Some people think
otherwise.  I think having a difference of opinion on this
particular detail is okay.

: So far, I haven't heard any Wizards bitching,

Speaking just for myself, I'm not bitching.  Even if druids
were stripped of ALL teleports tomorrow, I still think they'd
be a pretty powerful class.

Why?  I think I've seen EVERY class vent a little bit on usenet
at one time or another.  This, too, shall pass.

: Hm... Perhaps would that be because... it's no big deal? Duh.

Well, *I* think it's a big deal, especially since it robs lower
level classes of experiencing the world by traveling on foot.

The PoK teleports are probably a GOOD thing for the higher level
classes who no longer get that special (translation: tedious)
feeling when traveling Norrath by foot.

: How would a Druid know how hard walking is? I hardly even remember.

I've played non-teleporting classes extensively in the past and
remember vividly what it's like to walk.

I'm dissapointed in you.

Except nobody claimed that PoK teleports made the druid worthless.
This is a misinterpretation and overreaction on your part.

I'm just a little bummed that I re-rolled as a druid (FV server)
in large part to help my guildmates travel Norrath more easily.
Now I wish I had re-rolled as a dark elf or iksar necro instead.

: Hardly unfairly.

I think he's been pretty mature through the entire debate.  The
shameful responses have been from the self-appointed anti-whine
usenet police that inhabit this newgroup.  You know, the ones
who just can't let some venting go without throwing fuel on the
fire.

: Again, Druids don't have *any* class-defining abilities. Their only 
: "class-defining" ability is to gather so many abilities from other

I agree that being a jack of all trades *is* one of a druid's
class-defining abilities, but I think teleports were, too.  But
that's just semantics.  We can disagree on this one and nobody
cares or gets hurt.

: I would phrase that differently. The fact that you haven't found any of

And the fact that you think his posts were whiny does not, in
fact, make them whiny.

I'd chaulk it up to some harmless venting and a few valid points.
It's just a shame the self-appointed anti-whine usenet police
couldn't keep a mature attitude and had to immediately dwindle
into "attack and insult" mode.

I'll chaulk that up to those people being immature.
