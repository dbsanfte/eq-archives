Why would this necessarily be so, You go on a hate or fear raid and you
don't lose faction with your guild etc.  Hell Innorruuk drops a
necromancer focus item, yet they can still go to their guild.  I admit
it isn't really all that roleplaying to invade your deity's Plane, but
why would you necessarily think there is a faction risk.
