 Thanks - ended up doing just that - got my butt handed to me on a plate by
stonegrabbers and recusoes but on the corpse run heard a person in the
Nether' looking for a group. Got my stuff and came straight back and one
death later (getting to know zone) had a nice group with a magician later to
be joined by a druid.

Even managed to pick up a Wu's belt and Cloak off the auc for decent prices
so it was a good night.

The rockgrabbers just had too many hp and hit too hard for soloing and after
initial success on a Recusoe Hunter I discovered the next normal Recusoe hit
very hard ...*loading please wait*

Halfway during the night in the Nether' the magician taught me the more
efficient way to keep pet healed (using the buff and not the heal) so I
could proberly go back to Marus Seru no problem now.
