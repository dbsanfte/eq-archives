Man, I couldn't believe the tackiness of asking people to overload their
servers.  And yes, it was overloaded on mine.  Despite SolB being nearly
empty the lag made it almost too tough to play.  Another group of ours was
in Siren's Grotto (never crowded) and they lost a bit of experience because
of LD.  Meanwhile I hear guildmates saying "did everyone just drop?"

That's cool...now, hopefully Verant will be smart enough to say "hmmm, maybe
we should add horsepower before telling folks to try to bring us down."
