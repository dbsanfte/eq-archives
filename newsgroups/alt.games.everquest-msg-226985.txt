    I do. But I fight things that aren't trivial. If cleric mana is your
limiting factor, then of course you're going to notice it. If you're pulling
fast enough, though, it'll usually be slower mana (F bards) that is the
limiting factor and not healer mana - and a shaman, with his best slow, also
has the best mana regen.

    Once slowed, a Hard adventure mob starts putting out the DPS of a Normal
adventure mob. I can tank that, especially because of the long pauses
between swings, but it sure isn't "almost nothing".
