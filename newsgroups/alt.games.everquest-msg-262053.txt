I think they were spurned on by "that class is out exping my class" .
It always seems the lowering of power to a class happens fast while the
legit complaints of several classes get ignored.
Exploits bugs get fixed fast, as they should. Nerfs happen in days to weeks.
Fixes take months.
I think the latter 2 time frames should be switched.
I could care less if xyz class/player goes from 1 to 70 in 5 years or only 1
day.
Lots of players get bit by the green bug and complain bitterly.
I am not saying imbalances should remain forever.
I am saying either play the class from 1 to 65 errr 70 and provide input or
don't play the class and shut up..
