One thing though.... Remember when Blizzard was working on Warcraft 3 for so
long, and then dropped it?  That was quite a while ago.  Guess what they've
been working on all this time since then....

IMHO, I think WoW is a lot further along than what most people think.  It's
still a ways out there, but it's not like they *just* started work on it.

IMO, what I speculate happened is this... Blizzard realized that the
first-person Warcraft3 was going to be a bomb.  In the public's eye, they
axed it (rather than releasing a lousy product).  What I speculate is
this... behind closed doors, they switched gears almost immediately, and
started working on a MMORPG instead.

In other words, if I'm right, they've already been working on it for a very,
very long time now.
