> So, what do the rest of you think of the city design?

Just like the original EQ design, you have to zone too often when running 
from one part of Qeynos to another. What I really dislike is having to 
travel to one of the big city zones like NQeynos or SQeynos. Neither one has 
a dock so I have to zone into QHarbor and then hoof it through a couple more 
zones to arrive in NQeynos. If you're going to shrink the world by putting 
in dock bells in the first place, why not tie these important two cities to 
that travel grid?

I never liked the zone concept to begin with, it's easily the most immersion 
breaking aspect of the EverQuest design. They do it of course to manage lag 
and performance. It's a lot easier to track things zone-wide when the 
compartments are all smaller. UO got away with a seamless world because it 
was 2d, but compare this to AC where you could run for miles and miles and 
never cross a zone line. In AC you could look to the south and see a huge 
mountain, and wonder "What's up there", and then spend an hour running 
toward it, watching it take form as you approach. That was very cool.

Fortunately, most of the zoning is in the cities and the surrounding hamlets 
and villages. When you get out into Antonica it's mostly one large zone and 
you can run around for hours exploring it without ever crossing a zone line. 
The dungeons attached to it (Blackburrow, Stormhold, Firemyst Gully, 
Shattered Vale, Thundering Steppes, etc.) are all separate zones, but it's 
not that much of an immersion breaker when you switch from Antonica to 
Stormold, just like when you switch from Dagnor's Cauldron to Unrest. But 
running from one zone to another within the same city ... that's a drag.
