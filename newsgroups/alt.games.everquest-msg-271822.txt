Some more notes on this idea.  First, you'll hear people say again and 
again that you need to learn which skills are important for your 
character, and be careful what you spend on.  This is entirely correct, 
if you want to push in the way I've been doing; in the lower levels its 
relatively easy to buy all the skills you like, but as you level up, it 
becomes more and more expensive to do so, and harder and harder to keep 
up.  If you want to play a relatively broad character, then that isn't 
such a concern, but if you are trying to "overclock"; to play at high 
power levels, then you really want to keep your critical skills capped.

Unable to find a lot of information about the Bureaucrat, I kept all my 
Nano skills capped.  Recently I've reached a point where I can no longer 
spend on weapon skills or Strength or several other interesting areas, 
just keeping my other stats and my Nano skills capped is too expensive 
to allow for much more than that.  But further research now that I 
understand the class better has lead me to discover that I don't have 
any real use for the Matter Metamorphosis skill; I've spend tens of 
thousands of IP getting that up to its current level, and its not used 
for any of my Nano lines!

The other problem I've run into is money.  Untwinked, early on, money 
didn't seem to be a large issue.  Low level nanos and basic implants and 
such don't cost much, and money coming in off loot and missions keeps 
pace nicely.  I suspect for someone going a normal broad based route, it 
still might.

Overclocking, though, costs money; you need to buy implants in order to 
get the skills higher than they "should" be, and you need to buy skill 
boosting nanos in order to install the implants, I'm overclocked on 
implants in order to overclock my nanos: I'm wearing several QL50 
implants at level 30, and its only going to get worse.  In addition to 
this cost, though, I'm also a victim of my own success; I'm buying QL 40 
nanos, but I still have a level 30 income!

Every level or two I've managed to force my skills up sufficiently 
higher to use yet another nano crystal for pet summoning; this keeps me 
on the "bleeding edge" in terms of power, but it also means all my past 
pet nanos are just wasted money.  I've put less effort into my other 
nano lines, buying a new one every half dozen levels or so... far 
cheaper than one (or sometimes more than one) every level!

I'll also note that this game lacks the Bazaar of EQ, its like the old 
days pre Luclin (well, and post Luclin till they finally patched the 
Bazaar they'd promised us into existance), all commerce taking place 
live in chat channels.  But to be frank, there's Far Far less commerce 
taking place, at low levels anyway, than there was even in the dark ages 
of EQ.  Items and the way the game works are so complex that its nearly 
impossible to recognize something valuable from the hundreds of junk 
items that drop, and the "word of mouth" commerce system means 
inevitably that 99.9% of it all gets dumped.  Worse, unlike in EQ, when 
you sell something to a vendor, its gone, no dumpster diving, not even 
at the exorbitant turnover rates that EQ features.

I've yet to buy a single item off a fellow player, and I've only sold 
two; a pair of sunglasses I bought on the newbie island because I'd 
heard they would sell for big CR on the mainland; true, I paid 6K or so, 
and sold for 160K... I've seen people selling for as much as 250k. 
Weird.  The other was a Div 9 plasmaprotector, dropped on a mission I 
was running, sold for 100K.  That latter sale, oddly enough, was to 
someone who was asking questions in the OOC channel which made it fairly 
clear he was a newbie to the game, I'm betting he either got a gift of a 
million CR from a friend or bought CR for real world cash, the Div 9 is 
often mentioned on forums as an ideal weapon for some classes.  I think 
   I ripped  him off, I'm pretty sure that the weapon they are talking 
about is of a significantly higher QL than the 19 one I sold.

Or perhaps not, after all I've literally earned and spend about 300k CR 
on my own, on top of the 260K I got from those two sales... as you level 
up,, CR becomes pretty easy to come by, perhaps 250k for sunglasses is 
just chump change, like 100pp to a level 65 EQ character.
