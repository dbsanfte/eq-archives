Oddly, the question is, who did the most of the total damage done to the 
mob... and any damage over that needed to kill the mob in the last blow 
does count towards this total.

So, you did 200 points, and your helpful someone did 250 damage, so he 
gets the kill.

Worse, say you had a DS running, so that you did say 50 points and the 
DS did 200 points and someone comes up and hits it with a 51 point nuke. 
  He gets the kill, because the DS damage doesn't count, so its his 51 
over your 50.
