gladly.

SRAEL/OCCUPIED+TERRITORIES

look around at www.amnesty.org to find even more "terrorism" commited by
Isreal FIRST.

now you know why the Palestinians want to retaliate so badly.

http://www.zmag.org has some great articles on the war in the middle east.
Great unbiased perspectives from knowledgable people.. NOT politicians or
biased journalists.  (nothing specific just a general overview.. )

Perfectly legal to destroy buildings, and other property in Palestine and to
kill 1000+ people and call it "defense"?!
Come now..

that's easy to say when you support a country that violates their human
rights policies.  The U.N. outlined basic human rights.. is that too much to
follow?!

> American media is pro-palestinian, not pro-isreal.

how so?  in production (might even be done by now) is a documentary about
the people that have been killed in isreal (100 or so).
What about the 1000+ that have been killed in Palestine by Isreal FIRST.
Why does MSNBC regard human rights groups as "liberal propaganda"?!
How many times have you seen the isreali death toll on CNN?? How many times
have you seen the Palestinian death toll on CNN?!
The Palestinian death toll is 1000+ now.  I've NEVER seen that number
anywhere CNN, MSNBC or any other mainstream american station.

www.amnesty.org
www.truthout.com
www.zmag.org
(all non-profit news/human rights organizations UNLIKE CNN, MSNBC)

the above sites is what i base my arguments on.  i've given you my basis..
what about you?  Blind pride?  Bullshit?
have you ever read anything with a unbiased level of truth?!
ZMAG features some of the best speakers in America.  Have you ever read Noam
Chomsky's work? ever heard of Chomsky?!
If you've ever taken a college class in Philosophy, Anthropology, Sociology,
or Political Science, you've probably heard of him.
Its easy to toss these sites as BS for someone who is blinded by pride and
afraid of truth.
Did you even go to these sites?!  Visit them and spend more than a sec.
there before replying with another unsupported post.
