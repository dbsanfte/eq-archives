The thing is I'm KOS in most of 3rd gate(and some of every other zone in
Neriak for that matter) and being a warrior I lack invis. I had a caster
invis me once and take me there but the guy in the room in the library who
you give the wine to wont take me wine as I am apprehensive to him. How can
I turn in the leatherfoot raider skullcaps for faction?
