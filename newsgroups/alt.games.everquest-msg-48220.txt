    Need to find and buy a Journyman's Walking Stick on the Vazaelle
Sever within the next week for special event.  Want to spend around 3kp,
but open to negotiation.  If you have one you would like to sell, please
e-mail me at Maidd_vaz@operamail.com.  Please send your asking price in
the e-mail.  You may also contact me on EQ as Maiddaraya, but due to
school, I am not on to much during the week.
