Aye.  That always seems to come up, and I think it's a matter of
definitions.  A lot of people seem to use "Hell level" to describe any level
that was quite a bit longer than the previous one.  It really isn't. A hell
level was a level that was so long, that it was not only longer than the
level that came before it.... it was also longer than the level that came
after it.

For example, the old level 45 took roughly 3 times the numerical amount of
experience to get through it as level 44 did.  The amount was also equal to
going through level 46 two times.

The old level 51 took 3 times as much exp as going through 50....  but level
52 was longer than 51.   So it wasn't really a hell level, just an incrase
in slope.
