    No, you're missing what he's saying. It is entirely possible that where
this person fell, someone with his level of Safe Fall should not have taken
max falling damage but rather some lesser number. That would qualify as a
bug, and get the OP a GM res. There's a few places in Velk's Lab, for
example, where a monk that can normally fall from the very top of the ramps
to the bottom will 20 K for no good reason.

    Now, I doubt this is a bug. The cliff in EW is deep enough that people
who fall into it routinely land for max damage. But the GM may have heard
"safe fall" and "20 K" and concluded something is buggy, erroneously
thinking that a character with Safe Fall can't 20 K. /shrug - good luck for
the OP!
