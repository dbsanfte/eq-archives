OMG... when I ventured my very first character (a human Wiz) out the front
gates of FP and died a half dozen times getting to lvl 2 I would wonder how
on earth did thoes higher lvls get that gear!  Then at lvl 5 when I made the
first trip to WC and died a half dozen more times getting to lvl 6 I would
wonder what the hell was T1 or T2?  Yea, it was a very different game then.
You'd lug gear back to the Tunnel in WC and sit for hours trying to trade
for something you wanted/needed.  How I miss old T1, T2!!!  Never though I
would but now I get a bit depressed going thought WC and actually avoid do
so whenever possible.  But the times, they are a changing... :>(    Now if
my main has less that 1K in the bank and less than 200pp on him I'm off
killing for plat!  Oh well........
