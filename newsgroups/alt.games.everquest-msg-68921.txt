You keep saying "innovative". Okey, I'll buy that for a dollar... Q3 is
not innovative at all, it's basically Q1 *honed to perfection*. As I
said, id spends their time getting the controls just right and the
balance just right (whatever your opinion of the railgun :P), and leaves
innovation to the mod makers.

Anyway, I'm too old for either. I prefer the comparatively relaxed pace
of EQ these days...
