	The entire conflict makes no sense, the two races have no contact.

	Now imagine that Dwarves not only had the best stats of any Cleric race,
*AND* they got to use all the best equipment.  Which was added two years after
you decided to play a different race.

	There is no down side to playing a Wood Elf Ranger (well, other than the
fact that pecks now have better stats -- at least they're forced into choosing
Karana).  There is exactly one item that a Human Ranger can use that a Wood
Elf Ranger can't, and it's long obsolete (Ivandyr's Hoop).  There is no up
side to playing a Human Ranger.  You get poor stats, no racial skills, a bad
starting area and you're nightblind.  The vast majority of Human Rangers you
see were created when people thought Humans got an experience bonus.  And yet
they keep adding goodies for Wood Elves and Tunare worshippers (and Wood Elves
can't pick any other deity), and ignoring Humans and Karana worshippers.
There are supposed to be benefits and drawbacks to all character-creation
choices, but right now they're getting the benefits and we're getting the
drawbacks.
