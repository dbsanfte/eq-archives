*eyeroll* Yes, we all know monks are the only ones who pull, so this
was specificly targetted at them... Go get some cheese while you're at
it, eh?

Nevermind the fact it will be a boon to pet classes who used to watch
in dismay as their pets ran laps around them before attacking
something that was right in their face. That and fixing "dead spots"
in pathing where snerts could sit and nuke mobs safely is more than
worth having to deal with logical pathing...
