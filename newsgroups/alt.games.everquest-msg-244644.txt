I'm partial to the prayer shawl quests.  They require tradeskilling, which
might be more than you are looking for, but the actual quest bits were
pretty fun.  It is a progressive quest of 8 shawls each getting better
stats.  The first few are soloable, the last couple you might need a samll
group's help for parts, and the very last one requires a "raid" that has a
few fun drops that might be of use to people around your level.

You might look up the quest for Astral Leggings/Cloak of the Titans in
Stonebrunt Mountains.  You could probably solo that one, and it has a pretty
nice reward.  No other quests are coming to mind right now.  You might poke
around the Mage class board for some quests specifically helpful for mages.
