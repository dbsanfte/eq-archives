You have a strange definition of trolling.  Many trolls make one
inflammatory statement and then never post again.

A "tough" issue is people who violate the TOS - like, for example, you and
your wife - and attempt to profit from it.

I have no respect for people like that, and wish they would stop, as they
are causing problems for people who are abiding by the TOS.

Stop trying to justify your actions; there is no justification.  You're
breaking the rules and making money from it.  You get no sympathy from me.
