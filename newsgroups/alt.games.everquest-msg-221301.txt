Don't worry too much about that unless you start experiencing problems with
the new UIs not working properly, if they do then one of the patches has
probably altered how a window you have as custom works.
Since the latest patch, when a new pet window showing pet buffs was added
along with some other changes, I have had the error message, no problems so
far, a quick change and my pet window has the new features, but still no
huge pet get lost button lurking near the rest.
If you feel up to it open the corresponding file in the default folder to
the one in your custom folder and simply swap across the differences (may
take quite a bit of searching and still not work), this will give you quite
an understanding of what the different commands mean so you can customise
your UI exactly to suit you.
Make sure you back up all files you are going to tinker with, if things go
wrong just a name change fixes it, and save any new files to a custom
folder, not the default as when EQ patches you will loose all your work.
Good luck, a little work can yield some very useful UIs, especially an
inventory hotbutton window.
