Yeah, I guess I am too spoilt by the info SEQ maps gave me.  Har har.

No I haven't changed the height filter.  I tried some settings, it just
bugged me whenever I tried to use it.

I tried to map ToV cannyon and ToV zonein, the tools were useless and
cumbersome. I ended up with something unusable and I didnt forsee mapping
any more complex zones to have better results (tov is pretty much a big
square with a hallway)

Half the zones I hunt in "mapping is unavailable in this zone"

The ones where it does work, I spend 5 mins getting the zoom right, then I
move a few steps, and half the map detail/text dissapears, I try zooming in
and out, it doesn't return.  I move some more, then I can sometimes see what
I could 5 mins ago.

And EVERY time I zone, the friggin map loads.  I can't even use escape to
get rid of it when it does this (im not a mouse person, so its a pain to
have to use it every time i zone)
