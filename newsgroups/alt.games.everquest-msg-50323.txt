  Um...ok.  Also, some couples have fun playing it together.  For
example, my husband and I recently renewed our wedding vows in an
Everquest ceremony.  Right now we're having quite a bit of fun with
a ranger/wizard combo.  Don't know why Dan is so bitter, but I 
have nothing but good things to say about what EQ has done for my
marriage.
  Aside from that, yes, give it a try.  Just remember that it is a
game, and remember to do things from time to time like read a book,
take a walk, see a movie, eat, and bathe.
