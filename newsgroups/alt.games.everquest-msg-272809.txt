I was one of them,though I dont want another expansion,I only want
them to fix old bugs in EQ1 before taking my MONTHLY FEES from EQ1 to 
develope another game.
Opinions may vary,but this is how I feel about it,and I can not
imagine that I am the only one.

Fixing old issues before making another expansion maybe ?
They even announced that they are looking into "class balance" some
weeks ago,what about that?
I guess the developers are now busy creating some other useless
stuff,noone asked for,instead of improving class balance and the still
buggy DX9 graphics,not to mention the "mobs under the world" problem,
an issue introduced  with Luclin,when did Luclin came out ? 2002 ?
