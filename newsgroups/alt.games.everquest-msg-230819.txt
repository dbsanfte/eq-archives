Just teamed up with 2 necros(both 65) in GY in HoH with my 65 druid.
We were pulling 2 at a time and kiting them around. I would say having
Harmony did not matter much with Necro as they were splitting them up
very well. Although I had previously grouped in LR there the xp here
with just the 3 of us was quite amazing, and when one of them left and
was just 2 of us it was 3% aaxp each kill just about. There are
resists there, so it does help to have more than one class there that
can snare, and/or root if needed. Also helps to have a SoW/SoE caster
or at least JBoots there to out run them if snare fails so can be
recasted. Can't wait till I get DC so I can charm that A Wrulon
Youngling that is at the gate there.
