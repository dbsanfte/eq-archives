Interestingly enough, if you get them to another island before
gating or dieing, they will stay there for at least 20 minutes.
I inadvertently did that when I found the AC camp open once, and
didn't know they had 5k hp - tried to burn it down and ran oom, 
had to run for a while to get the mana up to gate.  When I came
back on the boat, I went there first, and he was still there.
