They give the same incremental increase as the general AAs.  So with
Run5 you are at +50% base runspeed.
Khrokhro's post halfway down the page at:
http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm22.showMessageRange?topicID=1009.topic&start=1&stop=20
has a near complete list of runspeed modifiers from tests run by a
guildmate of his in the beta.
