I like it plenty.  Particularly since I got my for free.  :-) 

It's a nice, fast 1 Hander, with a decent ratio.  I would like to
upgrade to something that hits a little harder.  Actually, a Centi LS
or a Lammy would be nice.

And I *THINK* it procs at level 20.  I got mine mid 30's and it was
going off then.

The proc is... ok.  A 12 point DD.  Goes off maybe once or twice
during a fight at level 40.  Basically, it's not an issue.

Sounds like a pretty good deal to me, depending on what armor you
traded.  Remeber AC is god.  :-)
