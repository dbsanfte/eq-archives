I've played PoP zones with now cleric for healing.  I've done, me (at the 
time 57 shaman), 61 druid, 60 ranger in PoN.  We did have 59 SK join us for 
a while, but after he LDed twice, he decided to head out.  Ranger tanking 
with my pet to help, druid healing, me slowing, backup healing.  None of us 
had KEI going.  Heck, I had not even had KEI cast on me yet at that point.  
I have crawled PoI with no cleric, just me (61 shaman then), and a 51 
shaman for slowing.  We did have some downtime then, but not enough for 
backpopping to be a problem.  The 51 shaman did die a couple times, due to 
major slow aggro, and I had to take over healing until mobs were taken care 
of.  Some of us, me included, did have KEI then.  I will admit, that is one 
I would be hesitant to try without KEI.  Druids get a pretty decent range 
of heals, not sure at exactly what levels, that make them pretty good as 
main healer in a group, better than a shaman really, for strictly healing.
