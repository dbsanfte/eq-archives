I gave 9 points to, as you put it, "tell [you] that the homosexual
lifestyle is not being forced on people" based on the story you linked
to.  Please make your position clear:

Do you accept my points as stated?   If not, can you offer rebuttals
to them?

Can you offer any way in which that article proves your statement?

Did you just give this up as a bad idea, and tried to cover your
embarassment by side-tracking with a personal comment?

Is your statement above any less of a dodge than what you often accuse
others of doing?

Can you reply to these questions without a "tap-dance" as you term it?

Will you clain that *you* did not, in fact, mean to imply your belief
that the "homosexual lifestyle" is being "forced in people"?

Can you, in fact, reply to any of this without earning any of the
accusations you so happily throw at others?

Well, duh!

This is the bit where you make some comment, fooling yourself into
thinking you have me where you want me, and congratulating yourself on
your self-perceived cleverness.  That comment will have nothing to do
with the your premise re: the article, be based on exceptions and
hysteria (if it has any basis at all), yet you will claim it proves
the general case while in fact it may fail to make any point at all.

Of course, you won't want to prove me right re: the above, so now
you'll try to deny it and claim some other motive, while still trying
to avoid further embarrassment re: said article.
