That makes it pretty useless. It is too open to scamming because
one person could mail the game while the other person did not.

I think you missed the calling of such a site, your site should be the
middle man who has the information of both parties. Your site should
then receive party A's game, then hold it until it receives Party B's
game. Both parties should include postage, as well as a 1 or 2 dollar
(or whatever) fee from you. Then you send them out to the correct
parties.

As it is your site really has no purpose, people can arrange risky
trades themselves. You seem to be just wanting to collect money
to help them arrange the risky trades. So you actually compound the
risk. Not only did the party send away their own game while receiving
none in return, but it cost them 1 p to do it.

On the other hand, your site would have a purpose if it was the
middleman.
