Eh?  *goes and looks*  Huh, I didn't do the watermark myself.  I'm not
sure what you mean Graeme, unless you just mean that the O is on one of
her boobs.  Considering that it's the second letter in her name and if the
F is covering her face the O's gotta be on her chest...oh, nm, I'm
tired.  THere's probably something subliminal there, I'm just not getting
it.
