Hiya Jennaii,

As a druid, and my hubby a wizard, I can say that I do sometimes wait for
someone to call evac.  Now, as a porter, I consider it my decision.  If
tanks are dropping fast, and mob isn't, I evac.  If cleric OOM and mob still
healthy, I evac.  If more than 2 people die, and the mob is still healthy, I
evac.  I have not evac'd before, and taken a wipe too.  It's all very
subjective to what's going on, and how bad we want to accomplish the
mission.

Bottom line, as the cleric, you felt they were going to wipe, and would
rather not let everyone die and loose all the xp from a rez.  I say, good
job.
