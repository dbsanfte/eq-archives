<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Then tell me why you suck ASS at this game without KEI (likely
with KEI
too), and people like celaeno KICK ass without KEI.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

This is one of the dumber and more childish responses yet.  You don't have to
suck ASS to like KEI.  

<<<<<<<<Talent or skill or not, there are many people who ARE better than you
at
this game.

Em: sees the sign, "do not feed the trolls".. oh well

-m>>>>>>>>>>>>>

You should perhaps seek out some therapy on why you have such low self esteem. 
Even if what you say about excelling in this game being a skill or a talent is
true, which it clearly isn't, can you think of a more meaningless and less
worthwhile skill to have?  It's certainly not something to thump your chest
about and act as if you're a leader of men or something.  Lol, I'm still
laughing at you.
