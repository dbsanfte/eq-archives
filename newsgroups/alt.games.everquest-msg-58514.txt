Perma-Camped spawns like the AC are usually unaffected. There is
always someone there. Zones like Lower Guk see fewer numbers, but some
camps like the FBSS will still have a list.

In the past this has been true, but this time might be different. The
"Beastlord" rush will not be restricted to the Luclin only. So you can
expect to see a lot of new BL in the old world starting areas. Overall
I think the numbers will dip slightly throughout the old world, but
not significantly. In general people stay with what they are
comfortable with.

When Kunark and then Velious launched the items dropped in the new
zones totally destroyed the value of most "old world" drops. You are
most likely better off hunting new gear in the new zones.

See my point above. I think this will happen a LOT.

I hope so :-)

Most likely. At some point the entire game code will have to be
upgraded. This would most likely mean EQ2, but you never know. If they
can keep the game up to date, it may never die.

Great idea!!
