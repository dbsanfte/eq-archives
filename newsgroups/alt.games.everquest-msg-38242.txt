No one twinked me...  I just play on a server with a really odd economy.
And got really lucky trading a DX sewing kit and eventually getting about 2k

and besides, the warrior is permanently level 30, he got deleted on

bleh.

I think the biggest thing is that I spent way WAY too much time buying and
selling in EC.
