I 2-boxed the Hole part of the shaman epic (magician + cleric to fight in,
CoH'ed in the shaman  :).  Still not done with shaman epic, but I've spent a
grand total of about 5 hours on it and I'm mostly done, I simply haven't
logged the shaman in for a while so no pressing desire to finish it.  :)

You don't need a rogue if you know how to "fly".  :)  Another part I 2-boxed,
both for me and for a friend's level 30-ish twink.  There's an actual key to
be gotten for the lift.
