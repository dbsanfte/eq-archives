ROFLMAO - I do a booming business in coldain tempers and cod oil....

coldain tempers are a subcombine nightmare...and cod oil is fishing 
boredom followed by a quick time brewing.

I also do sell some harder to get stuff, specialty herbs from factional 
zones, and forages=) I also believe in low profit, high turnover=)

and occasionally i will sell dye as well=)
