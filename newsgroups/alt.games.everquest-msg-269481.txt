In EQ1, the problem was made worse by the large death penalty.  If you had a
choice of grinding out another 100 mobs where you were, or moving to
someplace new for variety, but moving meant an increased risk of death until
you learned the new spot, and that death would add quite a bit to your
grind, a lot of people would stay put.

DAoC also had a large penalty, but on the first death in each level, it was
only 1/3 normal, and 2/3 on the second death, so eating one death per level
was not nearly as bad as in EQ1.  Also, the XP loss was capped to whatever
XP you had in the level, so you could not lose a level.  So, whenever you
dinged, you could switch hunting spots without much risk, or go exploring.
This made level grinding more tolerable.

Notice the newer games have gone even farther in reducing death penalties,
especially WoW.  I'd expect that in EQ2 (and WoW) people will be much more
likely to move around a lot, rather than just sitting in place grinding out
level after level at one spot.

WoW seems to have a lot less downtime than most other games I've tried, at
least at the low levels.  So far, I've almost never bothered using food or
drink (eating food in WoW basically causes you to regen health quickly, and
drink regens mana), because by the time I finish looting, I'm usually close
enough to full health and full mana that the time it would take to actually
consume the food and drink is enough to get me full.

EQ2 isn't quite as fast, but still, it is pretty quick.  Also, at the 10%,
20%, etc. marks on the XP bar, you get a boost to full health and power.  If
you want to be an obsessive power gamer, you can use this. :-)  E.g., if you
see that an area has some easy mobs and some hard mobs, and you are gonna
kill them all, do easy ones until you are just below a 10% boundary, then
do one of the hard ones to push you over, and you finish the fight at full
health and power.
