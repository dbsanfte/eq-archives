Last week I was sitting in EC as my main trying to sell off some old
equipment. My main happens to be an iksar SK. Here I am, sitting at
the tunnel mouth with a whopping huge sword in my hand, partially
decked out in dreadscale, and some moron comes up and asks me to SoW
him! I said something along the lines of "Shadowknights can't SoW."

A little bit later that day I decided to make a char who could spend
some time in EC, so I made a half elf warrior just to fool around
with. He's level 6 right now. So I'm sitting in the tunnel mouth, and
sure enough, some moron comes up and asks me to SoW him. And I'm like,
"Umm, I'm a warrior"

I wonder if these two were related. The first guy I should have told
him to donate by typing /d and stuck a nasty DOT on him. Idiots.

Neither of my chars are set anon or roleplay. Don't people read the
/who? On the other hand, maybe not. There's a troll shaman in my guild
who says people come up and ask him for clarity all the time and
claims he can't station his pet to stay put without someone begging it
for SoW or trying to invite it into a group...

Anyone else have experiences like this?
