Ayep.
Here's a quick breakdown for you:

Mature wyvern:  Level 44 to 48.  9800 to 9900hps.  Doubles for 170ish.

Froglok bok knight:  Level 46 to 50.  7900hps.  Double for 120ish.

Which do you think a group with Warrior, Cleric, Chanter, Rogue and
Shaman could kill faster?  Which gives more exp?

Soloer, yes since they generally can't do dungeons very well.
Groups, the only groups I see in Skyfire are groups of necros/mages
fear kiting crap or absolutely crappy groups getting absolutely shitty
experience because they are too scared to take any risk (not that
sebilis is any risk anymore).

The group he suggested is probably one of the most rounded group
possible.

I'm talking about getting about 50% more exp over the same time period
in a different zone.
