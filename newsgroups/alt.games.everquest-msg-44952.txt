Why am I doing this?

Davian, from what I can see of the thread (I don't even want to get into
that), I don't think that Bizbee's comment about paying the 10 dollars was
directly related to the druids acting as scouts.

Bizbee, I have to say it is kind of lame of you to ask people to find your
posts when your purposely make sure they are not archived.  My current news
provider sucks, and regularly misses days worth of postings, so I never see
a lot of postings.  If I go back to someplace like google, I, of course,
cannot see your posts, they aren't archived.  So if you were to ask me to
come up with evidence of something you said, unless someone else quoted it,
I would be unable to do so.
