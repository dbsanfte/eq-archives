In a response to a message titled "Who is coming to my wedding on Prexus"
the proper place for a response in context would be immediately following
the title or subject. IOW a top post is equivalent to context sensitive
quoting.

i.e.
Subject: Who is coming to my wedding on Prexus
I'll be there.
<then depending on further responses if any>

Can I get a port from West Commons?<sic>

Pretty standard format to follow questions or points immediately with
responses, else you get in the same quandry I poked fun at with ~"Me too.
No. Well I haven't yet." style top posting, just at the bottom instead of at
the top.

As far as email goes.
