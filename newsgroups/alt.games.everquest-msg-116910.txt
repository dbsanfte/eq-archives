  Yeah, one reason I'm really looking forward to levels 50+.  Though I've
been lucky, I managed to find a guild that had an average level near mine
when I joined, with a lot of people who enjoyed doing dungeons and other
uncommonly played areas pre level 50.  At 50+, when there are a lot of good
dungeons to fight in where stuff that people want drops, a lot more people
are willing to see and do those areas.  And also I think that people are
more willing to take up a challenge (like a dangerous dungeon) when they
feel their characters are strong... whereas at lower levels, people tend to
feel as if their characters are "weak" and that they'd be better of just
sticking to safe exp zones until they are higher in level or better equip.
Once your character is high in level and well equip, what else are you going
to do but put those skills to the test against some of the game's more
difficult areas?

  I think if somebody is disappointed with the game level 50+, they probably
feel that way either because 1) They don't like the "uber" politics that
takes place on their server, 2) They're sick of playing their particular
class, or just don't like their class or 3) Don't have the time available to
commit to taking up a lot of the challenges at upper levels, like 8 hour
plane raids.
