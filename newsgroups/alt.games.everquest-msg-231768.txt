I will put you on my ignore list for any number of things; heavy 
spamming, running a casino, ninja looting, heavy and inappropriate use 
of profanity, extreme incompetance, repeated LD that seems "convenient"...

Generally you have to be something over the top and annoying to get there.

But once you are on the list you are never ever ever coming off of it;
I have a fairly poor memory and can't hope to recall why it was you were 
put there, so I generally assume the worst, you are a baby stabbing 
father raper who litters without creating a nuisance.

Since my 65 cleric's ignore list is only about 20 deep, and most of 
those people probably were mules created to flog a casino till the next 
big winner, I don't have any problem.

My 61 mage's list is only about 5 deep.

If I found myself pushing 100, I guess I'd have to come up with some way 
to unignore people in order to keep the -really- bad people on my "do 
not group" list, but so far it hasn't been a problem ever since they 
expanded the list from 20 to 100.

Splendid
