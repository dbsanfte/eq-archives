Anyone remember seeing in a patch message that druid pets can no longer
be buffed? This came up in another EQ news group and I'm wondering if
it's true, since my spells don't seem to be sticking the last few times
I've played at charming stuff. Seems like a truly retarded nerf on
verant's part if it is, since every other class can still buff their
pets as far as I know, and god knows it's not like ours are so terribly
overpowered or overused to begin with. . .
