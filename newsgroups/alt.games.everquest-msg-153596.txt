By and large, no bonuses apply to CHeal.  This is because
CHeal is radically broken, a formerly almost useless spell
(when level cap was 50 and equipment adding HP wasn't
really at significant levels) that turned into the one true
heal post Kunark and has only gotten more powerful
as more things come along to ratchet up mob HP.  They
have tried to nerf it back down by adding to other heals
effectiveness, but thus far haven't touched it.  As is typical,
they have now nerfed it in a way that will only affect the top
1% of people using it, on tanks that excede 7500 hp by  a
healthy margin (after all, we don't time the heal to land when
you only have 100hp left) or in cases where you are facing
certain rare spell effects that cut down your effectiveness,
a curse that makes your heal only do a quarter of its max,
that sort of thing.

Clerics, Druids, and Shaman were supposed to be the healing classes.
At the higher end of the game, due entirely to CHeal, only clerics
could really fill that role well (yes, druids and shaman COULD
do the job, like Rainman could drive a car.  Slow in the driveway.)

By boosting the other healing classes heal capability, Verant has
managed to somewhat remedy this situation.  Clerics are still
the best healers, with more mana efficient, larger, faster heals,
but there are more circumstances where a druid or shaman
can do the job, and those two classes make much more adequate
backup healers.

Changing max heal of CHeal from one never reached plateau
to a lower rarely reached plateau isn't going to do much of
anything as far as current content goes, but might mean that
in the new "high end" you see even more viability for druids
and shaman as healers.

Nice extra?  Clerics now do melee damage output comperable
to warriors, and are decent caster interrupters, up in the region
you are worried about... remember that druids and shaman
don't get Incomplete till 58, after all, by which point clerics
long since got their now-useful pet and their shiny new uber
hammer and outrageously useful Yaulp V.   Oh, and even at
your level they already have Bash, which is part of their new
damage output but more importantly adds in with Stun to form
a pretty nice shot at caster interrupt, paladin style.

If you want to complain about something, complain about the
mod rod change.  No drop means no more ground spawn,
no more having your tanks hold rods for backup mana, no
more having the dead each bearing a rod to make recovery
from a wipe faster...  Mod rod just changed from a mana
storage device to a clumsy mana transfer device.  I can
no longer mod at my whim, but will have to call a mage
specifically each time I need one.  Communication lag
and mage having to handle many requests at once will
slow mana transfer down; I know because I've been
on raids where mages insisted on working "on call"
instead of the vastly preferable "pile of rods at my feet"
method.  And when the mage dies or crashes, the
supply will cut off instantly, instead of there being five
or six still on the ground and every tank out there
holding one he can run back and drop.  This is
going to hurt clerics (the principle mod recipient)
far worse than the slight CHeal nerfing.
