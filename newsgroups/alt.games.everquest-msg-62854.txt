Thurgadin Gate, Cazic-Thule gate. These are available to basically
everyone. The Thurgadin Gate can be made by anyone with a reasonable amount
of pottery level, the CT gate potion is a rare drop inside the CT zone
(Never really hunted there myself, so not sure what drops it).

There is the vial of swirling mist (I think that is what it is called)
available at fine norrathian magic shops across the globe, for about 1100
platinum, it casts the actual spell "Gate"...so it is just like being
translocated.

Shamans can make: Field of Bone, Innothule, and Everfrost gate potions. The
possibility exists for some form of Luclin gate potion since the Vah'Shir
will have shamans as an available class.

>Are they all creatable by only Shamans? (what level does the shaman

>What are the going rates if Shamans are the only creators?

Gate potions trivial at 170 skill, which, with the way alchemy works, for
it to be a trivial item, the shaman needs to be level 59. You *can* make
gate potions in the 120 alchemy skill range, but the failure rate is
obscene.

Base ingrediant cost is a little under 188 platinum. Figure to buy 10 shot
potion stacks for 2200 or so (which is selling at a substantial loss for
the shaman).

There is an item you can get via quest in the Overthere outpost which procs
overthere-gate....not a good idea if you are KOS in the outpost tho.
