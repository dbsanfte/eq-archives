This does not preclude male players who play blonde female wood elfs from the
role-playing group (although I must admit there are days when I want to
role-play and days that I dont.

I also know few people who play in third-person perspective, it blocks your view
of what your character is doing. It's the main reason I never liked
Boob...sorry...Tomb Raider. For those that do, well, their mind isn't exactly on
the game, obviously ("Bailiff, whack his peepee").
