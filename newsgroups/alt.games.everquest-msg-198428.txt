When was the last time you made your own clothes, computer, or sports
equipment? I know Ty Cobb's dad turned him a baseball bat on a lathe, but
that was near a century ago.

Besides, the point of these games is to play a hero, not a minor tradesman.
I'm hard pressed to think of a single fictional lead character -fantasy,
science fiction, horror, or mainstream who spent a significant amount of
time crafting *anything* except in a dire emergency or as part of a learning
excercise.
