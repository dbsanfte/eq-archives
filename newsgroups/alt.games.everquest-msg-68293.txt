80 people. In ONE ZONE. In a *CITY ZONE*. Yes, it is a new zone, but
it is still huge. GBay was as crowded as ever last night...100+ people
at one point. As was LOIO. Overally, the number of players unable to
play is minimal.

Yeah, the servers are working fine. It never was the servers that were
the problem here. It's compatability issues between certain users'
computer configurations and the changes made to the software.
