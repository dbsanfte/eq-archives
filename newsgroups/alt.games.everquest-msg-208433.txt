They tried that once, with the Velious expansion.

The final mob back then was called the Sleeper.  He could only be fought
once.  When his four guardians were killed at the same time, it started a
one time script with the sleeper rampaging through multiple zones, and his
four guardians never respawning.

For the most part, it was extremely unpopular with the players.  It sounds
like a good idea to most people, until they realize that it means only the
most miniscule fraction of people will ever experience that content, even
though the developers put in quite a bit of time on it.  Themselves not
among that fraction.   I very much doubt Verant would ever try it again.
