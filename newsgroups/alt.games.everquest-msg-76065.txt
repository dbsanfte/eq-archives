No. That's not what I mean. If you are a non-cleric and find yourself
in need of a rez, you should be prepared to compensate the rezzing
cleric if in any way possible. He IS doing you a huge favor, or you
shouldn't be bothering him in the first place.

Regarding the offer to pay, that is commendable and I wish everyone
was of that mindset. On whether or not I'm being condescending, it's
unfortunate that there are so many players who take the approach of
throwing themselves at a mob without due consideration, thinking the
ramifications can't be too bad when they can just beg for a rez or SoW
to aid in their CR. Players should put a little more thought into what
they fight. It is certainly expected of them in groups, why not
always?  I do not lump these players in with the other 50% of the
players who legitimately suffer a death from typical adds and other
players' poor judgement. It's often difficult to differentiate between
the two, and when in doubt, I always help out.

Very well put. That sums it up as well or better than anything I have
said here.

I should state here that I do believe that once you join a group, you
accept a certain unstated obligation to help you groupmates in any way
you can while in that group or to help them along their way upon
exiting. That's MY philosophy anyway.

A bit judgemental, perhaps, but I can't see condescention here. Bottom
line is, they are my spells and the world does not have free access to
them. I am merely trying to articulate how I may come to the
conclusion that I do NOT want to help a particular individual. I don't
expect a parade in my honor or anything when I DO help someone. I just
reserve the right to dispense my magic at MY discretion.

Thank you. I appreciate all feedback given in the spirit of
discussion.
