Unless I've arranged something in advance, or theres a RL emergency,
I stay till the last port out.  Even if I'm not the highest level res.  I've
seen
enough things go wrong with pops after most people have already gone,
that I feel its my duty to stay.  I"m not sure that TLs make it worse, losing
one or two people hardly cripples a raid, whereas before TL, you'd
lose the porter as well, at least till he can gate back in, and then he has
his gate spot somewhere relatively perilous, should he happen to buy
the farm.

How would this help?  Sure, there are lots of cool locations you can't
TL to without fragments... but most people would be happy to go to
one of the free four ones.
