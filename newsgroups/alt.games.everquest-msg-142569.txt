I'll use Yaulp line the moment it stops conflicting with BAotR.
Since the advent of Velious, the fact that the cleric self
only HP/AC buff line conflicts with Yaulp has made Yaulp
useless even for us hardheaded battleclerics

IF I'm forced to give up BAotR for it, you could give me
Yaulp XVII  (Str +254, Dex + 254, HP +254, AC+25)
and I'd still never cast it.
