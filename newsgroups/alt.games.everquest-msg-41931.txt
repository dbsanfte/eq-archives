You hear that very often. But don't all classes constantly have to worry
about damage dealt, as you get aggro? If a rogue constantly outputs maximum
damage, he'll get aggroed and dies like a fly or sucks all healers dry,
causing downtime etc, so the groups overall damage is bad. And if a rogue
has to manage damage in a way he doesn't deal to much at once, what's the
point of being a maximum damage dealer? Seen like this, the only survivable
front class would be a tank .. not too much damage, but surviving any aggro
(well .. not any .. but any normal aggro). This would just mean that classes
like rangers or rogues are senseless (die fast, deal more damage). What am
I missing here? :)
