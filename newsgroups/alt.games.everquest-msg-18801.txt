  Were there any no-drop items left in your bank vault?  That would
seem to make it all the more obvious that you'd been cleaned out. (Not
that there's any doubt in your mind, I'm sure... Verant on the other hand..)

  Also, out of curiosity, would your station/account user name happen to
be the same name of one of your characters?  I've always wondered how
these supposed hackers can target a high level player and hack their
account...
they'd need to know the person's user name, right?

  What happened to you stinks.  Hope you can find some kind of resolution.
