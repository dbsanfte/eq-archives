I think you misunderstant.  The marginal cost of the hand-crafted
custom furniture includes the cost of the wages that the craftsman
makes.  It includes more than the cost of the materials, but _all_
costs that go into making that _one additional_ piece of furnitiure
(including materials, wages, wear and tear on their equipment, etc.,
but noticably not overhead and training in the skill necessary to make
the furniture - those expenditures have already been made and cannot
be recovered - on a going forward basis, they are irrelevant to the
pricing).  In other words, the marginal cost is the cost to the
company (or craftsman, or whoever is making the thing in question) of
producing _one additional_ thing.  Think of it this way, a company
makes furniture.  The company has made 100 pieces already.  What price
is the company willing to sell the next piece at?  They are willing to
sell at a price equal to the cost of making that next piece.  It is
irrelevant to the company whether they have made 100, 1,000, 1 or
none.  They will price, in a competitive market, where P=MC. 

Going back to the EQ example, markets there are generally not
competitive.  Why?  because, in most cases, P>MC.  I.e.; people can
make a profit and recover their initial start up (training) costs.  It
makes sense, actually.  There just aren't that many buyers an sellers
of a given item.  In fact, often, there are no buyers or sellers for a
particular item (and the barriers to entry > 0, for all you econ
junkies).  This leads to non-competitive markets where P>MC.
