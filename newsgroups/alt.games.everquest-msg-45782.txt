Have you upgraded from a 3dfx based card?

If so I'd try searching your HDD for glide* and 3dfx*
and deleting everything it comes back with. There's a long known
problem for people changing from 3dfx's cards, that thier drivers
badly written and leave junk everywhere causing games to crash.

Try searching www.google.com for "removing 3dfx drivers" or
similar, you should find some programs / guides to doing it properly.
