Nope. Because in kiting there's at least a *chance* that snare will break, or
SoW will run out at an inopportune time, etc. so the mob might come nail
you.  But when exploiting a pathing bug, there is zero chance that the orc
will go against it's programming and reach you in time.  I really don't see
the comparison. Kiting is a tactic. Using a pathing bug wouldn't seem to
qualify as that.
