Thank you.  I hadn't thought about that.  I think I'll go over here and 
put out the fire in my brain now.

See, now you're just tempting me to start up some lovesick DE male with 
a crush on Lenny.  Now THAT'S roleplaying :D  "Lennyyyyyy, I got faction 
in Freeport for you.  Lennyyyyyyyyy, I trained the guards on that nasty 
woman Teapray so you and I can be alone together.  Lennyyyy let's go 
watch the sunset in Oasis while she picks up her corpses."

Heh.  I ran into a boy the other day and grouped with him for awhile, 
and was discussing his char names (he had his high-level cleric there 
healing us, whee!), which were all from a series by an author who has 
some fairly melodramatic same-sex romances under her belt, and he 
explained that he actually enjoyed the books (I commented that they were 
awfully 'slashy' for boy reading) because he, as he put it, 'identified 
with' the main character.  We were joking all night long about how he 
thought the males in the camp were quite sexy, while I would discuss 
which females were hottest and why.  Afterward I thought of how blurred 
that discussion would have gotten had I been playing my male rogue :)  
"I'm a girl who plays boys who likes girls who play girls who like 
girls... oh, stand up, it didn't hurt THAT much."
