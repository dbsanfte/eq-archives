Isn't that just class balancing, though?   Druids get to be
pretty much the masters of transportation:  SoW; ports;
levitate; etc.   Heals that don't get outdated until their
mid-30's or later.   Kiting abilities that allow them to
solo when they want (and with their transport lines, where
they want as well.)   The price for all that "great class" in
the "normal" game is less importance in the end-game.

Clerics - and even warriors as a distinct class rather than
a catch-all tank - don't come into their own, though, until
later.   At some point, having that ranger or SK be the
primary tank just isn't as effective or desired, just as
having a cleric as primary healer becomes more important
in lower levels than it is in lower levels.

It's just balance.   And, IMO, a far-better trade-off for the
majority of players who won't ever see the Planes.
