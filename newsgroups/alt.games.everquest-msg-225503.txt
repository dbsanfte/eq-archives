I have /assist hotkeyed anyway most of the time, I just edit out the tank
name and do it that way.  Thing is, it's not always perfect.  I find assist
fails 10% of the time, even if you rapid-fire hit it.

If a giant is standing still and at 100%, I assume it's fair game.  Same if
it's walking at 100%.  If, though, I cast on it and it doesn't run at me--it
stands there or walks--I figure someone has already rooted/snared it and
I'll OOC an Oops or walk off, whichever is appropriate.

Once in a while it's purely accidental.  I come over a hill and blunder into
something, it hits me, my pet digs in, and all I can do is hope I'm
outdamaged or kill my pet.  (I just use an animation, I may try charming
sometime, but it seems like I'd take more damage.)

True story:  In Rathe Mountains (also on Tunare) recently, I pulled a HG.
As it ran at me when I tashed it, it was clearly unengaged.  Pet got it down
to about 90%, and suddenly it ran off.  Whaaaaa?  Lather, rinse, repeat.  I
/ooc'd for whoever was grabbing it to please stop, it was engaged.  It was
happening fast enough that I didn't realize my pet wasn't following it.

Eventually, it suddenly ran off and I chased after it.  I found it chasing a
39 Bard who I then /ooc'd by name to please leave my giant alone.  I got the
kill in the end, but then he took me to task for taking HIS kill and told me
that I should use /assist.

...?

Long story short, it wound up *he* was the one that needed to be using
assist.  He admitted charming a giant that was damaged (and thus
engaged)--mine--and doing it repeatedly.   This was while he had one or two
others he was snare kiting, plus a cyclops, in different areas.  I can't
quite recall how it went, but after repeatedly telling me I needed to learn
how to hunt here and use /assist, he admitted that he didn't keep track of
all his mobs when snare kiting, and never did say that *he* used /asssist.

To which I politely (in the way southern debutants are polite when they
point out you shouldn't wear white after Labor Day) pointed out that perhaps
*he* was the one who needed to learn how to hunt here.

He said nothing else at that point.  I wanted to fume to my guild, so I
typed /gu So, I'm here in RM, and this bard comes up and repeatedly charms
my giant, which I'd already damaged *and* it was fighting my pet....

Only I accidentally started it with /ooc instead of /gu.  I wanted to crawl
under a rock when it appeared in /ooc, I was horribly embarassed.

But the guy apologized finally, and said he'd be more careful.  ;)
