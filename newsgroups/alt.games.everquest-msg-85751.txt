So the concept of DOT/Root when the foe get's to the `flee' stage
does work. Good news. And root as a spell is not given a break
check on combat damage if I understand correctly. It's still going
to be very timing sensitive, knowing when the foe might flee and
how long the root can be expected to last on that foe...and there's
still going to be accidents.

What race is the shaman and does he wish he had access to the
`clinging darkness' spell the Innoruk's symbol can cast? The main
thing is I don't want to be L.45 before I decide that I really do
need the symbol.

This is, largely, the core of the plan. The group is reasonably 
powerful but doesn't have the depth to handle a bad pull. As such we
need to be able to split pulls and have an escape when the pull isn't
working. 

The original group was going to be dual monk, which would be great
fun and the whole party could then FD, but the utility spells and
healing of the Shaman was a touch too tempting. As well as slow 
letting more powerful singles be within reach.
