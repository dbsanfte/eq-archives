Make the Invisibility line of spells have a set duration <like 30
minutes>. As they are now, they're unpredictable. They can last 30
seconds or 15 minutes. Many times I've been invited into dungeons. I
cast Invis on myself to get where the group is, invis runs out when
i'm running past mobs and I die. Now I have to worry about invis
running out when I'm trying to retrieve my corpse! I despise this
spell. It's the number one reason I try and stay away from dungeons.

For pet classes, fix the con system so you can tell what lvl pet
you've summoned.
