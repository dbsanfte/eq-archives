Jay, I agree with you 100%!!!!

I just bought EQ about 2 months ago, despite looking at it 
constantly in the store.

At one point, I saw something that said that Sony makes about
$4 million/month (US) from EQ subscriptions.  They said that 
about $1.5 million/month goes towards server admin and related
costs, netting them a tidy $2.5 million PER MONTH profit!!

It's clear that they make the majority of their money from the
monthly fees, so like you said, why not sell the software for
exactly what it costs to print and distribute?  Had they done
this, I would have bought EQ when it was released and as of
today, Sony would have over $240 of my dollars rather than the
$50 they have right now.  Of course, many of my friends have 
the same attitude I did -- "but it's $10/month ON TOP of the
game price" and they won't try it out no matter what I say.

Go figure...

Mike
