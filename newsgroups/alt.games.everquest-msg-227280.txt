You're simply trading one criteria for another.  With your system, you have
the additional criteria that you have to be the right class/race to loot it
(and the neediest one if there's more than one of you).  With the rand
method, you trade that requirement in for a 1:6 roll.

But you can also roll on stuff you don't need, but can sell.  So, your
chance goes back up by a factor of six.

Unless you only XP group in places where stuff you want groups.  Then you're
just using the rest of your group for your own advantage... which is far
greedier than the random method.
