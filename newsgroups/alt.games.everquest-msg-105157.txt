I'm not sure how the druid DD spells stack up against the wizards at
lower levels, but I agree with the poster who pointed out the 50% damage
thing. I'm kiting every mob with my wizzy now. (Hell, up to three at a
time now. Heh.) But when somebody tries to grab my kite, I feel that I
no longer have to run, since the mob is no longer chasing me. Just start
flushing nukes into it instead of lower damage dots doing the work and
let them do part fo your work for you. Then, yes, thank them for the
"help" as you take the xp and loot the mob right in front of them. It
also helps to do a happy little dance as you skip away to go find your
next kite.

This, of course, assumes you are kiting safely away from others and not
just running over people's camp areas, etc. If that's the case, then let
them have the kill and stop being a dickhead.
