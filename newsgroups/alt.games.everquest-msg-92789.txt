Ok, hope I remember this correctly. I *think* you have to be in the 
windowed mode, the one with your class icon visable and stuff.  You bring 
up your inventory, and left-click and hold on an inventory slot for about 
1 second, then the inventory slot is on your cursor.  Move it to the 
correct hotkey slot and left-click to drop it there.  I generally have 
both my weapon slots and 4 main inventory slots on various hotkey banks to 
allow for fast swapping of instruments and such.
