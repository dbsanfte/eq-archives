    That's still the case with Fine Steel plate-skilling. If you're talking
about skilling on Banded, check out East Freeport - it's a fair haul to the
water vendor in zone, but all the materials and forge are otherwise in one
building.

    I'll safely assume you're talking about post-131 tailoring. For pre-131,
obviously, the Crystalline Silks drop in Velk's, which is blue to 60.
Post-151, as long as you plan to be a tailor and don't parachute into it you
can gather the components as you level. Imagine a wood elf druid's career,
and how many of these he can gather *as he levels* without gacking greens:
spider silks (Butcherblock/EK/Lower Guk/Sol B), Arctic Wyvern Hides, Othmir
Furs, small pieces of velium, sabretooth/excellent sabretooth skins, high
quality cat skins, ruined pelts, crystalline silks. If you plan to be a
tailor, you can gather as you level with ease - especially if you pick
either wood elf or halfling druid as your class.

    If all you want is skill, then you can ride Othmir Fur and Arctic Wyvern
recipes to 250 - and those aren't difficult to harvest (depending on class).
IIRC, the Furs even drop off the othmir pups....

    Now, if you want specific items (like Ice Silk armour) then you're
spot-on. Why they'd make the ultimate tailored item (Ice Silk) be a 3 for 10
success rate at 250 skill (costs roughly 100 K pp to attain), with a 1 K pp
component cost, with the mob dropped component dropping off yellow-at-60
mobs in Western Wastes and not always dropping, and with stats on par or
slightly inferior to Insidious armour from Hate is beyond me.
