If you want to fear kite, then stop singing that lame song of yours
and have the annoying cleric cast the fear instead.  Snare and
twist two useful songs, instead of just one.  I'd go snare, haste,
and sword dancing, but thats just one of a myriad of options.

If the cleric doesn't know he can fear, I pity the fool.  If, on
the other hand, you can think of a better plan involving bard
singing fear instead...
