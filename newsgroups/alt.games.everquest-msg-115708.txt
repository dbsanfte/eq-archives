Something is deeply *wrong* with PoF aggro, I've seen a ton of
theories over the years including one I saw that said charming
anything in the zone was deep sh*t as you got some bizarre zonewide
aggro transfer when charm wore off.

Suffice to say that once the inhabitants get 'stirred up' (failed
zergling crack works well for this) it gets borderline impossible to
do much except drag corpses to your favoured pseudo safe spot and camp
some clicker Clerics.
