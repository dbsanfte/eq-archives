I wondered about the same thing a while back. I was toying with another 
alt and was just amazed that I never ever seem to have trouble getting 
back to the city guards.
Prior to that I was under the impression that you should make your mind 
quickly because once you are under 20% health you'll never make it.
But as it seems right now I can run with 21% and never get smacked on the 
way back. Either it is my superior running skill (JOKING!) or pcs aren't 
any slower than mobs now.
