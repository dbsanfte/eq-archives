That's right. Tens of thousands of people. I've been with my present
employer for almost eight years � let's call it seven. Fifteen to
fifty calls a night, four nights a week, fifty weeks a year for seven
years. (I've never called in sick and take no schedule holidays other
than my two weeks a year.) Do the math. That's 21,000 to 70,000 calls.
A realistic estimate for the entire time would be 35,000 calls.

I have no idea what you mean by marketing convention or motivational
speech in this context.

In my opinion, the people skills are at least as important as
technical skills for a support technician � be they your ordinary
"call fodder" techs or your super techs. You work for a company that
sells product (or service). That means that your job, like it or not,
is selling product. If the customer perceives their technical support
experience positively, you increase the chance of repeat business and
referral. A positive call experience is not necessarily dependant upon
successful resolution of the issue. It is *always* dependant, however,
on the relational skills of your phone techs.

While you didn't use those exact words, your references to insanity
and committing murder implied it.

I realize that this was intended as humor, but I find this type of
humor particularly offensive. The same way I find racial humor
offensive. By using this type of humor, you are perpetuating a
negative stereotype and creating animosity. Aside from my personal
distaste, this animosity will come through on the phone to your
customers, detract from their support experience, and reduce your
effectiveness as a technician.

I have to agree with you here. People are stupid. Beneath contempt.

Merriam-Webster defines stupid as:

1 a : slow of mind : OBTUSE b : given to unintelligent decisions or
acts : acting in an unintelligent or careless manner c : lacking
intelligence or reason : BRUTISH

This describes people to a tee. But not individuals. Individuals are
typically intelligent, reasonable, and rational. There are, of course,
exceptions.

I have never seen people act in a way other than stupid. But I can't
think of an instance where I've met an individual who displays this
quality.
