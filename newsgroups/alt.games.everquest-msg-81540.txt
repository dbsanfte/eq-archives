Well thanks anyway for the help guys, Guess it's a good thing it didn't work on my comp, Not that
it would matter since my Damn account is inactive, They really could use a better way to pay 
to play everquest, I'm sure the current method works fine in most areas and for anyone with a
credit card. But what about those of us who live in some ungodly place without a credit card 
and no access to buy EQ Gamecards. In other words I'm screwed. And it really REALLY 
sucks.
