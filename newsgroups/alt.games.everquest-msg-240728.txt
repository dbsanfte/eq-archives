Guild is grinding in HoH for the most part, along with occasional forrays
into BoT for Mini's or tower minis.  Other pre-elemental planes are done on
a catah as catch can basis. I personally tend to do a lot of pickup / guild
LDoN's, as Im saving points for armor upgrades.

Mind you Im NOT Saying that Aggro wouldnt be better with a BoC, Im just
saying that its not absolutely REQUIRED, as was implied.
