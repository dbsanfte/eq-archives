This is a problem, but seeing as you are a shaman you can double shrink
yourself and bingo, no horse head. I have a horse on my shaman and a lizard
on my mage. I like the horse movement better, but on the mage I did not want
to have to see the horse's head in my way (small races this is not as much a
problem - of course my mage is erudite).

For me the cheapest horse was around 8500pp and the cheapest lizard was
10500pp. This may be a faction issue or it just may be they decided to not
price colors differently on the lizard and pick a middle of the road price.
As I said above the movement is different the lizard sort of bounces in an
(IMHO) annoying way and the horse does not. I have not noticed any other
differences between the two choices.
