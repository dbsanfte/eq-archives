Okay, I've done some more parses, after Tony checked some of
my numbers and concluded I was getting reasonable results.
I'm still a bit bothered that a delay 20 weapon consistently
takes more like 2.08 seconds per swing, and this fuzziness
seems to be enough to make the haste calculations fuzzier yet,
but the overall results are clear, and I stand corrected:
spell haste and song haste indeed do NOT stack.  (I don't know
about song overhaste yet; i.e., does it merely let you exceed
the cap on total haste, or does it stack on top of other
spells and/or songs?  I have a bard friend with whom I will
conduct that experiment at some point.)

Tony remarked that my parses were short, which surprised me
since I felt that several minutes and several hundred swings
should be enough to get good numbers.  I've since looked at
various boards discussing parses, and seen posts talking
about 8 *hours* of data for a single parse.  Wow.  On the
other hand, those parses are usually looking at things like
DPS, proc rates, critical hits, and other such features that
require a lot more samples to get a reasonable average.
Since all I wanted was base attack rate, I think my samples
were long enough, but I did extend them to 10-15 minutes for
my more recent measurements.

To summarise what I did, I took a delay-20 weapon and checked
how often it "tried to swing" when I could not see my target.
(I also found the rate was the same if I had no target at all.)
I then added all possible combinations of a 15% haste potion,
25% haste song (via a right-clicky on the weapon), and 36%
haste item.  I found that the item would add to either the
potion or the song, but the song plus potion was the same as
the song (i.e., the larger of the two).

I admit this is rather disappointing, since I can buy potions
that give much better than 25% haste, meaning my clicky weapon
(that required quite a long series of quests to obtain) is not
as wonderful as I had thought, though it's still pretty good as
a weapon and for its stats.  Even my epic, once I finish it, is
only 40% haste.  (And both it, and the song on my current
weapon, also bestow other useful effects.)  Still, I have to
admit that having it as a clicky is nicer than fretting over
potions ticking away between pulls, or when mobs dispel the
potions.
