Yeah.. I think Hate is strange.. What do i mean? I mean that more peeps that
zone in, the more aggro you will get no matter what..

I have been to hate some times.. (Trying for the SEoC for my ranjar.. hard
one though) and i truly believed everything would be a walk in the park when
i joint a open raid.. We were 50 peeps zoning in.

Oki.. the breakin was pretty easy.. no problem.. Then we run to the west
camp, and someone brings a laaaarge train.. Luckily clerics camped out, and
things sorted..
Well.. after 8 hours of constant pulling, moaning and all kinds of shite, we
only got to kill the maestro.. How come? Beats me tho..

Usually i go up with the guild with 2 groups.. 50+ i recon.. and we can do
maestro with that.. So how come we could not do that with 50 peeps? Beats
me.. lol
Of course when i talk to people in the ubah guilds and they "Bah.. Hate is
boring.. noob place.. too easy".. and we cannot get to kill inny to grab
that SEoC.. Aargh.. :)

Some day perhaps.. But.. as i said.. think a large number is major train
magnet up there..
