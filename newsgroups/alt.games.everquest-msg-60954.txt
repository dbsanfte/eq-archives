I have 256mb right now, and only 2 memory slockets so an upgrade would
have to be a 512 one, and that costs a bit, think i will try the game
first then figure if i need more ram or not.

Still 256mb is a lot for a game, wonder if they used any kind of
optimizing at all :)

Think that FS2002 says minimum 64mb or so, and that one is rather
intense on graphics, shure with 64mb it would be slow...
