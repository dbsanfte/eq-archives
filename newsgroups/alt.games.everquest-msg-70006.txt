All the comments I've seen seem to imply the following :-

CPU speed isn't all that important. But Intel cpus seem to be running the
game significantly better than AMD cpus.

You need 512Mbytes of memory to have any chance of having all the new stuff
turned on. But it does run ok in 512Mbytes.

The game works best with a Geforce 3, but a Geforce 2 works ok too. Voodoo
cards and others don't work quite so well. 64M cards work better than 32.
