Make sure you used /ignore warriorsname and never group with him
again. Seems like you are trying to learn whereas the warrior was a
loot hogging no brain lil kid who probably begged his equipment from
sympathetic high levels in north freeport bank. Avoid them like the
plaugue that they are and find another group, solo or play an alt.
Dying over and over again leads to frustration and good people quit
the game. It would be a shame to see that happen because some 12 year
old twerp thinks only about "loot em...smash em". Jeez.....thats what
nintendo is for.
