Try using that /mixahead 10 setting (the default is apparently 8)
increase that in increments of 2 and see if the problem persists.  I
believe sony suggests you not increase it over 14 or 16 as sounds will
not match the motions of the game then.  You can always revert back to 8
if you're not happy.
