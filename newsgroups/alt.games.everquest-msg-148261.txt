Try something like this.  Beastlord SoWs self and the Mage.  Levitate them
both, too.  Pick one of the skeletons, and have the Beastlord and Mage send
pets to attack that skeleton.  The other mobs should run to the Beastlord
and Mage.  If they don't, the Beastlord and Mage should attack them.  Once
the group has it so that one skeleton is busy with pets, and the rest of the
mobs are on the Beastlord and/or Mage, the Beastlord and Mage take off
running, and drag those mobs around the zone.

That should leave one single skeleton, with the Beastlord and Mage pets on
it.  You can start nuking the hell out of that Skeleton.

I don't know if that exact procedure will work, but something along those
lines should be feasible.
