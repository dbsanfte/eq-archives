With Regard to KS'ing Dyllin I was camping him for the full 7+ hour spawn. I
went in the morning to check camp and a dwarf was there. we chatted a bit
then I went to play in hhk. he gave me alot of great pointers about the camp
and timing the smuggler walk route. I went after he had killed him and began
my long camp for the awsome testament. a few times during my camp a 42 druid
kept popping in. I told him I was there camping it and would let him know
when I was done he couldhave the camp if he wished.  just before spwn time
he popped in . I had myself ( 16 druid at the time) and a ranger. Dyllin
popped and the druid immeadiatly started nuking him.  My wife ( the
ranger)(RL wife too =) got the kill and so I was able to loot the page. but
this was a clear cut case of attempts to ks me. he threatened to petition so
I advised him to do so. he didn't.  But, as for KS'ing. I really don't see
much either. fact is this is the only time I was intentionally almost KS'd.
if your a caster...get this book. hey its free! =)
