 I have met some very nice people in EQ no doubt. Surprisingly a lot of
people my age just relaxing in a game. I've played online games since the
days of Duke Nukem on Kali. It seems that after a while, you learn to become
very hard skinned and just a tad brutal. This holds true for all games
including my 3 years on Fighter Ace.
 Funny thing I have noticed about Everquest, a very, very small minority
seem to be arrogant and rude. The majority are real ordinary people who are
extremely nice and always willing to help in the game. It seems no matter
how stupid the question I ask, I always get a friendly answer with no
undertones of sarcasm. It just amazes me.
 This really came to play when I joined a guild on Drinal. These woman and
men are so helpful and giving. All 30-50 in ages and so polite that it
freaks me out sometimes.

 My question is, Are they this way because its not head to head ?
And
 Are the personalities different on PvP ?

 Just curious. I've had to drop the so called "Defense Mechanism" that many
years of online bashing taught me. I am either getting old, or I am turning
gay.   Go figure.
