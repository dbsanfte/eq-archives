Ok, to settle this once and for all I logged on briefly this morning to
put this to the test. (Would have done it last night because I'm
curious, but we were out playing in the RL zone again.)  I summoned up a
pet, got the level 9 pet on the first try (yellow to me) and ran out and
found a decaying skeleton wiht a rusty long sword. (Wasn't going to
waste one of my high damage pet weapons for this kamakazee skellie.)
Next, I found the closest convenient wisp and made sure I had gate
memmed. (Sorry about this, Jabober.)
  /pet attack did indeed get the pet to run in and attack. The wisp was
beating on the pet steadily, but I saw not one single successful hit by
the pet on the wisp, though he was swinging gamely. I tried handing him
teh sword during the battle (not that it would have made any difference)
but was unable to get him to arm it in mid fight for some reason.
Anyway, still no hits by the pet and he was down to 1/4 health so I
gated.
  Strangely, I never did see any invulnerable messages regarding my
pet's attempts to hit the wisp. I'm assuming that this is because I have
"other's misses" turned off in my spam filters, but I'm not positive
there. I would have thought the system would have informed me of the
invulnerability thing anyway.
*shrug*
So, there we have it. When I get a level twelve pet spell I'll
experiment some more, but until then, sports fans, the level 8 necro
spell pet will *NOT* hit magic attack only creatures.
