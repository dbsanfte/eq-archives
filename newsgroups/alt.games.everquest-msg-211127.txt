If you are seeing the same thing I did some time ago (back when
SoL was new and I started seeing fun things like whips and daggers
attached to boots, don't remember any swords through heads, though
I did see swords through shoulders) you can fix it fairly easily.

There is some sort of conflict involving Velious textures and the
Luclin graphics (Luclin graphics == the much famed "new UI" which
is now the default, not to say only UI, the old UI having been
phased out).  Somewhere in your .ini file(s) should be a flag with
a name referring to this (something involving Velious textures),
set it to FALSE.  There may even be an in-game command (/something)
which will set this flag false so that the next time you start the
game the visual oddities will have vanished, but I am not sure if
this is so.
