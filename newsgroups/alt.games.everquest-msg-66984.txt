It must be a matter of personal taste.   For myself, I can't stand most of
them, and have turned them all off with the exception of female humans and
half elves (and wood elves, since they have to be on to get half elves.)  For
the most part those were the only two models of the old version that I truly
hated.  Losing wood elves is a small price to pay to lose the awful half elf
one, especially.

As for the rest... the new wood elves now look like Heroin addicts.  Iksar
look like Godzilla wannabes.  Dwarves look truly awful.    I turned my model
on only long enough to pick a passable face, then off again.   They even took
away the Dwarven roll. : (
