So I have no actual data to support this, but I've been leveling up a 
baby cleric, and tried a number of the new hot zones the day after the 
patch.

I suspect, very strongly, that these zones are giving exactly the same 
exp now as they were before they became "hot".

I also went back and did some killing in WOS, and suspect that this zone 
is also giving the same exp as it was before the change in hot zones; in 
other words its either still "hot zone" exp, or else it never was.

Sadly, my cleric's levels are still going up, so I don't have a stable 
case to compare; a 50 cleric with 70 SK isn't going to be the same exp 
per hour as a 54 cleric with a 70 SK, for either of them... and even if 
it was for the SK I haven't really been looking at his exp rate.

What I'd need to actually prove this theory would be someone who's done 
some AA exping in the zones in question, and hasn't leveled up since.
