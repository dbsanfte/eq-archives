I fought there within the first week of Kunark, and I've fought there within
the past year and yet again within the past month (got more twinks to PL ya
know, and if you have no need to worry about the trains it's got what seems
to be one hell of a ZEM...).  I haven't seen any changes other than the one
that was announced that made mobs...  wait for it...  "paperclip" as they
jumped pathing points (I like that term, quite descriptive of how mobs
switch paths now), and there's a reason for that.  The game engine doesn't
*allow* any other sort of change.  To get new pathing, there are two
options.  You either download a new zonefile with a new pathing matrix
mapped out, or you change the way the game engine handles pathing.
Spectacular example of that recently when they "fixed" pathing and suddenly
mobs have an annoying tendency to drop through floors when they get hung up
instead of warping like they used to.

Now that you have the facts, would you care to try again?

If I don't have the experience of my 65 levels of pulling?  That's
illogical...  I wasn't talking about location-specific experience.

That experience pulling that tells me if I hug a wall too close a mob will
jump pathing and "zigzag".

And the experience to see it when it happens, recognize what's happening,
and correct for it accordingly.

I've found some weird pathing in this game.  I used to love Hate just
because of how truly bizarre the pathing could be.  But LDoN hasn't thrown
any particularly bad pathing at me yet, just the normal stuff that my
pulling experience lets me deal with without a hitch.

I haven't advocated being needlessly risky yet.  I *have* advocated not
being needlessly cautious.

> maximizing odds of success != lazy and timid

I haven't seen you advocating maximizing odds of success, merely maximizing
odds of surviving.  If that's all you're striving for, great.  That's a
valid play style choice I guess.  Not for me, but whatever floats your boat. 
You probably wouldn't enjoy grouping with me.  :)  That's ok, getting into
ultra-cautious groups isn't particularly enjoyable for me either (though
that is one thing that makes me enjoy monk soooo much more than magician... 
I'm generally the one that gets to set the pace).

I don't bother to ask.  :)  Any decent cleric will broadcast by "body
language" when they're starting to need to regulate mana.  The ones that
don't are gonna get you killed eventually anyway no matter how cautious you
are.

In a group of people who panic, sure, you wipe.  If nobody panics,
everybody, every single player in the group, has hitpoints to throw at the
problem.  If such a truly catastrophic situation occurs, I'd start barking
a few quick orders to keep the group from panicing.  Yeah, barking, too
much raid leading, and anybody I group with will probably have had orders
barked at them on raids before (and people panic a lot less when they can
focus on getting an instruction done).

There's more wiggle room than how much mana the cleric has left.

This is where it helps to play with smart people that say "virtue dispelled"
when it happens so you can adjust.  But even without that, a single duck and
quick heal when you notice what's happening to the tank, followed by a CH
and a "did virtue get dispelled?" should suffice, if even that is required. 
Usually CHs are cast with enough margin of error that a missing virtue
doesn't even require that.

If the virtue dropping caused CH to miss, the ranger or rogue was obviously
tanking already.  :)  Maybe you're talking about a lower level group that
doesn't have the ability to re-virtue, in which case losing a virtue might
be a huge hitpoint swing.  But then again, the mobs are going to be hitting
for a lot less in such a group, so the dynamics shouldn't change much.

Not that that is ever a concern for me.  Divine arbitration is a neat toy.

You're still fatalistically resigning yourself to losing.  Play smart and
try to win instead.

In case you missed it, my ranger dinged 52 in a LDoN adventure.  The only
reason snares are missed are because mobs are 100% resistant, or somebody
is slacking.

So, for that 10 minutes after sow wears off everyone else...

That's like saying rangers are the best tank because they can weaponshield.

No, I'm sarcastically poking at your silly pulling-magician theory.  :)

You don't sound like a very good cleric.  Seriously.  Lose that attitude
before you get into any hard fights or you'll feel goofy being OOM while the
target is still at 75% life and the other clerics are keeping their groups
up just fine.

Hey, I feel your pain.  I went through that learning curve with my cleric
twink on raids not all that long ago.

This does assume a desire to raid.  If you don't have that desire...  maybe
you should go on a few just to get the experience that will make you realize
how silly that sounded.

Why is it faster?  Cause I went and pulled.  Better?  Because it's faster. 
Of course "better" is subjective.  Faster, however, isn't.

Good, go ahead.  :)

Look, it's the "ultimatum tactic".  Learned that one in 8th grade.  See it
used a lot in politics.  Always thought it was one of the sillier tactics of
debate.

Especially silly when the *entire* discussion (except for your tangent into
the pulling-magician) provides the answer of why it is better.  I win, and I
win faster than you.  Better is certainly subjective, but you'd be amazed at
how many people will share the opinion that winning faster is better than
winning slowly.
