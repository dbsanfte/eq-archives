    Getting the pet out won't be a problem. But you watch - as soon as he
engages a mob, you'll get an add. His aggro range is higher than yours
unless you're even to him, so he drags stuff into the fight. ESPECIALLY if
you let him follow a runner towards possible adds.

    No, by then it'll be too late. One resist, and the dogs are off to the
races. As you level you'll be able to judge how long until a mob runs, and
when to Cling.

    No, Tox stinks. Dark as anything, and nasty adds. Only things worth
hunting are those skels right by Paineel.

    Many things in The Warrens are exceptional. 3 INT cloak, 2 INT belt, AC
6 WIS 3 MANA 5 bracer, 3 INT food (that is Banquet level and non-Magic, so
you can ALWAYS harvest it and it lasts a while even if you don't force feed
to keep it around), an AC 1 STR 2 HP 4 range-slottable hammer.... the list
goes on. I can just imagine what will drop in Stonebrunt if they think that
Warrens code prevents an item from being farmed by high-level players.

    The XP from the keys is a pittance. You kill the Jailer for HIS XP, and
also for the "trick". At 19, you can't pull the Trainer without all three
mobs in his room coming, and I found Goner couldn't handle three even if
some were green. However, if you pull the Jailer past the Trainer room only
ONE training kobold comes out and adds - a two pull - then go back and pull
Trainer and the remaining training kobold - also a two pull. Be quick about
it, though, as the Pit Fighters seem to be a quick respawn.

>> So by 15 I can move around the zone "safely" ?

    The Prince wing, yes. By that level you'll know the names of the
kobolds, and which will aggro and which won't. You'll also be able to walk
down the main hallway pretty much unmolested. Your PET won't, but that's
another issue.....

    Heh, I HAVE to dispute that. I've had almost all the rares pulled to
zone for me at one point or another by passers-by in search of faction so
they can bank after The Hole. At 19, Prince is one level blue (level 18), as
is Krode IIRC. Think the Lorekeeper was also blue or even. Huntmaster was
yellow, and Cave Bat Lord, The Mighty Bear Paw, King, High Shaman, Muglwump
were all red. Have yet to see Packmaster or the Warlord.

    My necro is an alt, made solely to explore Odus content. As they release
new zones out there, I'll trot her out to explore them, until she reaches
The Hole level (another place my dwarf cleric main refuses to hunt). Then
she'll likely become a_farmer00, as I don't really have anyone that can farm
items. I can't imagine getting her to a high enough level where she isn't
soloing, and is a twitcher.

    Supposedly 15 to 40. It's supposed to be the second coming of Lake of
Ill Omen, so use that as your guide.

    This can be tough, though. I've been the only person there a LOT. Or
seen someone zone in, wander until they saw a blue, pull it and two green
adds, and train out. If you're a group-oriented person, The Warrens may NOT
be what you're looking for.

    And I'm sure it helped you that the purple necromancer named Laverne by
the zone wasn't looting the bronze weapons on her kills, yes? ;-) I remember
seeing you there over the weekend - glad to hear you did well! Yeah, the
cash is truly remarkable for that low level a dungeon.
