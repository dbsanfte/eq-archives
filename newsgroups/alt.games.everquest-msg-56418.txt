Just a little rant here, but something to think about.  We pay $9.99 a month
for access. Not a lot, but still earned cash. Based on that, today's patch
denied me of $.15 worth of gameplay. Times that by 2 to 4 patches a month,
server outages and login fiasco's......... You get the picture. I think Sony
should pro-rate or credit us for the downtime. I get credits for dropped
calls, service outages, etc. from my cell phone provider and have gotten
them from my isp, regular phone service and other utilities too. Maybe if
Sony did that, then withheld the cost from Verant's licensing fee, they'd be
more accurate when patching and more responsive to server loads (I may have
these concepts wrong, but I'm on a rant). Anyway, I do appreciate the
entertainment Sony provides with this game, but on days like this, it's just
15 copper in the crapper.
