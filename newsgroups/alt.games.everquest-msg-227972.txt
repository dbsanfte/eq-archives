I'm not totally sure this guy "gets" it.  What he wants is a world where you
can have PvP.  What has been shown time and time again is that PvP is not a
sustainable and viable game in today's market.  People vote with their feet,
and what they've voted for is servers where there is no PvP.  People like
THIS guy lament the dumbing down of the game and the removal of things that
he considers immersion, but what he doesn't seem to understand is this: he
is in the minority.  Most people like things the way they are.  They want to
do their own thing without having someone else come along and spoil their
fun.

Yes, some people consider it more fun and challenging to have to always be
on alert for PK'ers, to strategize your play time around the possibility of
being PK'd.  Again, though, very few people enjoy that.

Feel free to heap scorn on Sony and other games for pandering to the
unwashed masses... that's an old song.  But the reality is that Everquest is
a hugely popular game and Sony is making money hand over fist precisely
because they have created a game a majority of the people will enjoy.
