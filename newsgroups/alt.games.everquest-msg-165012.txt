One day Nancy went to work at a big firm and learned her boss would be tied
up in meetings all day. Having been proactive, she had all her work caught
up, so shortly after the Boss closed his door she fired up Everquest on her
computer. Logging in her druid she began kiting Frost Giants in The Great
Divide. One after the other she slew the giants, her experience bar
ever-climbing. From the boss' office she could hear chairs being moved,
distracted by the noise she heard the tale-tell sound of her wood-elf
getting pummeled. Trying to flee she realized that in her haste, she had
rooted herself! "OH SHIT!" she yelled as she looked down on her dead druid's
form. The door burst open behind her and the Boss said" You ok Nancy!?!?!"
blushing as she blocked his view of the monitor she said, yeah, "I just wish
this software had a better Spell-checker".


ok, for good or bad, this is my first original EQ joke. I hope ye liked it.
