Yep, that is true, but Disease Cloud, which is the first one he
mentions, is a DoT.  I recently ran into a 55ish SK in Velks who was
pulling with a DoT then switching targets when they got back to camp.
Nothing like trying to mez a dotted mob to piss off the bard.  I
explained why this was a bad idea, as well as I could considering the
fact that said SK didn't speak much English, and finally broke her of
that habit.  Saw her in Seb today and did NOT invite her into our
group.  Of course I aslo know she only has about 900AC AND no haste
item.  
From my experience, SKs taunt better than anyone short of a 60
Warrior, and they can get enough AC to really be a main tank.  If they
had defensive I think they might be better than warriors in big
battles.  I love watching a good SK draw the adds to him so they can
be mezzed; it's a hell of a lot easier than using my AE slow/snare and
hoping to mezz them before they stun me.
