I ding 24 today with my little Wood Elf ranger and have read that this is a
good point to go to Everfrost and start fear kiting (yellow) mammoths. I
have never done any kind of kiting and I'm not exactly sure how to go about
it, and it doesn't sound like something I want to try and get wrong. Do I
snare then panic then start firing my arrows and the occasional nuke. or do
I fear then snare and save Mana for snaring again when spell wears off. Any
comment (well almost any I guess LOL) or suggestions would be much
appreciated.

Thanks
