Qeynos itself is not a good place to raise the warrior's guild faction,
Warriors of Steel. Most of the quests there require you to be at least
amiable to begin with. If you're 7..15, I'd recommend turning in gnoll
fangs to the warrior woman in Halas -- gets you faction with WoS and most
barbarian groups, and good xp too. If you're 15..20, you can turn in gnoll
scalps from High Hold to a guy there for HH faction and WoS faction. You
can, of course, do either of these at higher levels, but you won't be
getting any xp from them.

Warrior of Steel is also one of the factions if Freeport, so there might
well be quests there you can do to raise your faction, but I have yet to
delve into the morass that is Freeport faction balancing...
