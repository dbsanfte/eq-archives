Even as a chanter I prefer single pulls or doubles. Why pull extra if 
you are just going to mez them? Why risk a wipe if something resists and 
taunt doesn't go off? Whats the point? Whats the advantage to the group 
of having 4+ mobs mezzed?

> But I absolutely agree with your statement about KEI.

I disagree here too. The convenience of KEI is overwhelming. It can 
double a groups kill rate and reduce downtime to zero. KEI changes the 
game more than any other buff in the game, including Temp or V.

I have a number of 50+ characters that would probably be more effective 
naked with KEI than fully equipped without it. My AC would be nil, my 
mana pool halved, and my stats and resists would take a beating, but so 
what... my mana through-put would be vastly improved, and that's the 
bottle neck. These characters aren't taking hits much so ac/hp/resists 
aren't critical, and the extra mana throughput would dramatically 
improve my contribution to the group.

If I could get perma KEI by tossing my stuff in the bank something is 
wrong.

Something is seriously wrong when a single buff is worth more than the 
rest of the character's gear put together.
