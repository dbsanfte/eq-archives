That, or maybe I know my shit when it comes to druidic healing.

(I was in a safe hall group (boring spot) two nights ago when someone
shouted for a healer for back wall. I asked who was there, since my
group had more healers than we needed and I was wondering if some of
the people I like to hunt with were there. I was told they were 3
tanks, a shaman and a bard, and they *needed a cleric*... I laughed to
myself while they continued shouting for a healer for almost an hour
and laughed even more when they ended up leaving the camp.)

Well, there's only so much efficiency you can get when you're
competing with another group for the spawns near ground floor... we
had a bard for cc when we moved into the back wall spot, and other
than that, we had ranger and paladin for CC rooting. Puller would get
one or two or maybe three, they'd all whack em down, I'd heal and
damage shield. Except for when they pulled 3 or we got a pop ad,
downtime was determined at least as much by spawn rate as by my mana.

Did I mention we didn't have a warrior at all for most of the evening?
