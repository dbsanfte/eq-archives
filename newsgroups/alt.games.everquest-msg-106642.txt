The sad part is that it doesn't even take that well played a team.
All the druid has to do is keep the necro regened/chloroed, ensnare,
and DoT, while the necro just fears, DoT's, and sends his pet to work.
Can easily take down even/yellow con's like this with minimal effort
or mana loss.

In a sense it's kinda ironic that the two best soloing classes also
make the one of the best pairings.
