What's the significant difference, exactly? It's still a case of the 
patch causing a service outage as far as you're concerned. Does it matter 
if it's due to the patch still in process or login delays? Every time 
I've tried to log in and couldn't after a patch, I just assumed that, 
whatever the particulars, the patch process was still keeping me out.

I suppose that's entirely possible. I don't think I'd call it "likely", 
though. I can't recall ever having had that experience, myself.

I'd agree. I suppose I can see where it would be helpful specifically in 
the case of login server issues, as you may hear of people being back in, 
while still being unable to get in, yourself. Like I said, though, I've 
never faced a situation where I couldn't just walk away and sucessfully 
get back on later. /shrug
