  I personally see nothing wrong with it, but it is customary to ask first.
There are some situations where a group might not loot right off the bat
because they're /rolling for an item or something, or a person might be
calling their friend to take a NO DROP item off the corpse.  I used to loot
seemingly abandoned corpses without a thought, if for no other reason to
clear up the clutter in the area, but now with the /hidecorpse option, there
is less justification for that.
