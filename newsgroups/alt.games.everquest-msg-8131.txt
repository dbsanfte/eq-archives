ok, in Dec they introduced a patch that F*cked all pets, it goes like
this, pets will use there own ATTACK and DELAY no matter what weapons
you give them.  The weapons will still proc, if your pet is high
enough level to make it proc, so what i have found is the best thing
to do, is to carry a pack full of velium daggers, i use this only
because it procs,  and by equiping 2 weapons on a pet you initilize
Dual Wield.
