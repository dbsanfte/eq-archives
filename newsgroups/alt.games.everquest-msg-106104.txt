But 8 is the magic number we all must have (holy hand grenades anyone?).
Letting us have more slots so we arnt messing about swapping spells would
"massively unbalance the game", or at least if you listen to most of the
people on this NG. I agree with you, its a PITA changing spell sets, and
adds nothing to the game. Unfortunately we have a lot of people who either
dont use spells, or have enough slots due to their class. They just want to
make it harder for everyone else, which I guess is pretty typical of most of
us.
