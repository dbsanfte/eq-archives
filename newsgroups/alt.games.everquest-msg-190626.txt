I have 2 accounts.  Occasionally I start a new character and give him some
plat.  I don't talk to myself.  In fact, I have one character that has never
said one word in game, but when I started him I handed him some items and
plat.

I suppose they could check the account info, etc. but I think the real issue
is that part about nobody giving a fuck.  Players do, since no one wants to
pay inflated prices or group with clueless people, but SoE isn't concerned
enough to take action.  That isn't really surprising to me; banning accounts
and paying lawyers (if it came to that) would certainly cut into profits.
