I tend to think the power-that-be at Verant make some real bonehead
decisions vis-a-vis game design, but this (the Karana weirdness) is
something I'd like to see more of -- if they follow through with it, if they
involve the players in it (via quests), and if there is a satisfactory
resolution to it (both in terms of material reards and an engaging
storyline).

These are big ifs, and would be a challenge for the best GMs, considering
the medium involved. I would not criticize Vernat too harshly if this Karana
plotline was less than an overwhelming success.
