Hi everyone:

Well, I was delighted when I found that my level 60 Wizard was on good
enough faction to run through the Western Wastelands and have the Dragons
actually like me! So, I decided that I might try to solo in the zone, and so
as yet, though I've not had any mishaps I'm very cautious about venturing
too far away from the zone-line to SG due to the Ice Burrowers that roam.
These con yellow and are *not* friendly at all ...

My question is, do these Ice-Burrowers pop up all over the place like those
annoying Sand Burrowers do in the Grey? If so, I'll be rather disappointed
because soloing would then become way too risky. I'm okay if I'm invis, but
I don't want to throw caution to the wind thinking I'm okay when in actual
fact I'm not.

How safe (Ice Burrowers) is Western Wastes for solo play, and what should I
be watching out for?

Thank you for your time as always,

Stevie.
