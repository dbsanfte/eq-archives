This isn't an arrainged marriage. This is an arrainged mating. It
smacks of breeding, I objected to breeding humans like minks. Now
humands may imitate minks, but thats different from someone else
breeding them.

Eugenics should be nobody's cup of tea. There are somethings you can't
tolerate, my list includes cannibalism, pedophilia, and eugenics.

I got the idea that it could be worse, half-siblings, where would he
meet outside people on his little farm?

His words were mate and bear children with people of my choosing. It
sounded like it was determined. I didn't see much in this guys
writings that wasn't optional. I am sure there are unwritten
sanctions, there often are.

It didn't look like, "you two pair up and see what happens", it was
more like "I selected this person, start mating". In ye olden days,
children were selected for marriage by parents, for some good reasons
of politics, and economics. Now if the spouse was lacking, often there
were extramarital couplings, and children (who may look like the bard
in court, coincidentally). This is selecting genes and smacks of
breeding humans.
