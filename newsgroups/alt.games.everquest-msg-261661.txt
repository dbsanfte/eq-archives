Or perhaps items like a horror claw shard can be repaired with the 
approrpiate tradeskills...

Or perhpas the decay rate should be based on level appropriateness 
(taking into account that a level appropriate character will both handle 
and care for the weapon properly)... so a claw shard in a level 
appropriates hand would last forever... but in the hands of a level 8 
twink it would break in 3 days...)

Item decay doesn't have to screw legitimate use of items. Especially in 
EQ where they are difficult to acquire.
