Powerleveling is when someone assists you in leveling. This can be done many
ways, the most common is for someone around 50 to cast great spells on you
and follow you around while you kill things you normally could not kill. It
could also take the form of someone your own level following you (ungrouped)
and healing you as you fight, so you get all the XP will less downtime.

It is a way to level faster than you would solo or in normal groups.
Downsides are you don't get to see all the neat things you normally would
and your skills (such as attk, defense, alteration... all the skills you
aren't using) don't develop as they should.

Its normally done for a purpose... to get someone to your groups level so
they can play, to get someone to a level where they can cast a spell your
guild needs(clerics to 39th) etc. Some people do it just so they don't have
to play YET ANOTHER character from 1-10 :)
