Don't know why, but my surname request for Bladesong was rejected. By the 
suggestion of guildies, I petitioned. After several days, petitioning 
each day and waiting several hours, a GM showed up, confirmed my request 
and made it happen, no other questions asked. Just because a surname is 
rejected, doesn't mean it is invalid.
