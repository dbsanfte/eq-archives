Its not relevant. Blaming your parents for genetics is weak, in a 
vacuum, even when it is the single sole responsible cause.
At anyrate, I'm not 'defending' blaming a video game.

It was a reference to the Simpsons. (Why Krusty endorses such utter 
garbage) Besides a greiving mom on a crusade needs money to fund that 
crusade...

Odd that nobody blames the media, really. *They* manufactured *her* to a 
large extent... then again we could always just blame *her* parents for 
not giving her the substance of character to ignore the media and their 
money...
