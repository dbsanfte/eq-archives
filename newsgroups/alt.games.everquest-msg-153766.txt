I'm sure that's true.  But marginal guilds will see some people
leaving for higher-end guilds because they can no longer do the
mobs they were doing, and that's a bad thing, IMO.

Mod rods and Manaburn meant you had extra healers and extra DPS
beyond what your guild's player base will now represent.  Any
marginal fights you were doing can't be done now without adding
more players.  That means it'll take longer for guilds to move
up a tier and that means some increased pressure on players to
change guilds so they can do higher-level mobs, especially when
you consider that those higher-tier guilds will also be looking
for more players.

The thing that's lost here is that the top-end guilds (which
were the ones doing the complaining about the long fights in
SSra and VT) aren't going to be affected.  VI will re-tune
their fights.  It's the guilds trying to move up a step which
will be affected since VI has changed abilities and won't
retune the encounters they need to advance...
