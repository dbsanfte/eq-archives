Ummmm...... if you get to him first, why bother charming him at all? Why
not just go straight into attack mode and take him down before some
wizard KS's you?

I've never seen the S. Ro one up to con him, but most sources I read
indicate that he runs a few levels lower than the Ocean of Tears
version. We took that one down with two mid-40's players, and the S.Ro
one should be easier, so use that as a benchmark.
