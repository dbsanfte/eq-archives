I do not know if this is still true, but at the time of the first wave
of guild deletions (for having less than ten accounts with a member in
the guild) you were allowed to create a guild only once per account.
I remember an acquaintance ranting about this after his guild was wiped
for low membership and he was unable to recreate it with him as the
leader (he was in the guide program and knew a couple GMs, he told me
that when he tried to get them to help him out they told him it was
"policy" and there was nothing they could do).  Not sure if this was
a cross-server restriction, or even if it was just a part of their
"reduce the guild glut" initiative at the time.
