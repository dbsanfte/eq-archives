After collecting 26 shards (8 on my rogue, 8 on my first cleric, and
10 on my second cleric) I finally went for the first time this week.

Because of some weird aggro bug, we kept getting entire floors worth
of MObs at critical moments and, after two nights, gave up just as we
were getting to mini-Atens. Because there's a rotation on our server,
I won't get to see it for another month.

Le sigh.
