And here I always thought it was because they were scarred for life
when, grouping for the first time since L8 in CB, they were in MM at
L30 failed to survive their first lesson on agro management when every
caster in the tr-, er, slight overpull, turned on them after they cast
that first heal.
;)

The biggest problem I have with druids who never heal is that they
don't seem to ever learn agro management, and a caster who doesn't
understand agro management can be a huge liability in a group.
Druids who learn to heal effectively in stressful situations also
seem to do most everything else effectively, and as many posters
here have pointed out a druid can be very valuable at any level and
in nearly any circumstance in the hands of a clueful player.

I've seen too many effective 51+ druids for any amount of whining to
convince me that the druid class is broken.

Perhaps it is simply that druids are so easy to play at lo/mid levels
that makes them so hard (for so many in the player population the class
attracts) at higher levels?
