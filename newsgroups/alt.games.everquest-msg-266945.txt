You will need to get to level 5ish Artisan before you can learn the 
recipes for some of the App 3 spells.  I am a 6 artisan, and have made 
several of the App 3 spells for myself.

There are several quests that result in bags, including one 8 slot bag.

Buy the artisan books off the vendor in the artisan instance for the 
levels up to your current level, and scribe them to learn the recipes.  
At level 3, you won't have any app 3 spells yet I don't believe.

Set up a hotbar with them, it will make it much easier.  You will need 2 
or 3 banks for all of them, but each type of crafting seems to only use 3 
or so of them at the low level, just a different set for each skill.
