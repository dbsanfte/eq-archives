Friday night I finally decided to complete the Ghoulbane, my partner and
myself went off the Unrest in search of the Crazed Ghouls expecting to find
them around the Gazebo in the courtyard where they have been since the
inception of the quest.  To our surprise they were not there and we were
told they were in the barroom on the 3rd floor of the mansion.  This was not
a good thing, but being a lvl 38 Pal and 37 Druid we felt we had a fairly
good chance of getting to them, but not of camping them if the heart turned
out to be a rare drop.  We were wrong and at the top of the stairs we were
met by a growing wall of hostile mobs and the druid evaced out after
dropping to dangerously low health levels.

Later in the week we will return to Unrest and get the heart with the help
of a full group of fairly high level characters.  My question is has Verant
made any other unannounced changes in this quest such as putting the crazed
skels in the heart of Najena?

What it appears it that after making ghoulbane no drop Verant has decided to
make it far more difficult to obtain as well.  I would assume this is
because Pals are becoming too powerful since with ghoulbane and the  spell
Instrument of Nife they can do massive damage against undead.  Assuming the
heart is not a rare drop the quest is still doable with some difficulty, but
if the heart is a rare drop then assuming the other two ghouls are in
equally dangerous places then it may well be easier to return to the old
quest and do a raid on upper guk.  Basically, what has happened is that this
quest has changed form one that could be done relatively easily by one or
two people into one that will require a strong group and more than a little
difficulty.  If this is what Verant wants, and I assume it is, so be it, but
it would be nice if the notified people of the fact rather than leaving it
for them to find out,  Moreover, the excuse that Verant moved the ghouls to
make it easier on the teen level players who hunt the courtyard is
especially lame since Verant has since the inception of the epic quest had
no qualms about sticking Cazel in the middle of Oasis where he can play
havoc with any and all who encounter him.
