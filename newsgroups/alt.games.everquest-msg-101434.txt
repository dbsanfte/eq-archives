It continually amazes me how many people haven't figured this out yet.
There is a big area east of the FM ledge extending almost all the
way to the Warsliks zone, which is full of the same mobs except goons
who don't path that far over. Yet people still flock to that damn ledge 
and waste all of their time running from goons and doing CRs when they 
get caught. I suppose this is a logical extension of the Oasis-docks 
mentality.
