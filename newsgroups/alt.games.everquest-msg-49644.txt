You've already gotten some answers, but to clarify:
Everyone except the lizzies are KOS to the lizzies to start out. That
means that your Son's Barbarian, your wife's dark elf, Bob's ogre, and
my Troll all start out KOS at Cabilis.

As to faction, I've read in reliable sources that it is *possible* to
raise your LegionofCabalis faction high enough to walk in the gates
without the guards ganking you, but you would have to kill an insane
numbr of sarnaks and goblins to do so. Even then, there are a couple
other lizzie factions inside the city that will make it dicey.

Hopefully you've already gotten your corpse, but if not, make sure you
have a /corpse hotkey, cammo up, and go drag it away to safety. Then,
stay away from Cabalis, silly druid. You are viewed as "a light snack"
in that town.
