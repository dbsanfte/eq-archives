Correct. But then, slowly but surely, you'll become one of the most
desired classes in groups as you level up. *IF* you learn good aggro
control. Your ability to evade is every bit as important as those huge
backstabs. But a well played rogue can make the difference between lots
of xp and lots of corpse runs in a higher level xp group. Just learn to
control your aggro. Cleric's hate mana sponges when they are busy trying
to keep the tank alive on a mob that hits for 300+ per and can quad.
