Decay isn't that bad at 62 if you head out to the pussling area. Spent
a lot of time there recently getting 3 sets of CoD flags and it was
mainly blue. Rat tunnels are actually good exp at that lvl if you have
a good group. 

PoI? Dunno, never hunted inside the factory and everything else was
worthless exp even at 61. 

PoN is pretty good through 63 maybe 64 once you get past the dropoff.
Not sure about a hedge group but the spots I usually hunt down there
(Slarithug, spiders, caves) all tend to the pretty high lvl. The
fishermen being the lowest mobs on that list and they average 53-55,
IE some are still blue at 65. 

PoJ? Well you have still have the hidden caves at 62. Some of the mobs
at the very front start to turn light blue but if you go in any
further it's all still blue. 

Not that I'm debating your overall point, unless you're flagged at lvl
62, you're tied to a very few possible exp spots and most of those I
listed you'll need a good group for.
