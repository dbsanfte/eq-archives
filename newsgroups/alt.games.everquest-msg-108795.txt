A lot of common scams involved standing somewhere where a trade could
window could not be initiated - any attempts to hand them items/money
would "miss" because of world geometry or some such. The scammed would
click with the plat coins on their pointer, and the coins would be
dropped. The scammer would then snap up the coins and take off with
free money.

There were also issues with random crashes when picking coins up off
the ground for some reason or other...

A drop confirmation box on money would have been a better solution,
but, oh well.
