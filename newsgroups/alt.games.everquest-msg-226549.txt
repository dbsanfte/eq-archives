** Melee Enhancement **

The melee enhancement changes are now available for testing.  This 
system needs as much dedicated testing time as you can find.  Please 
regularly use the /bug and /feedback features to report what you discover.

A brief explanation of the enhancement, along with some questions and 
answers about that system can be found in the Developer's Corner on the 
EQLive.com site (under the title - EverQuest Chat on November 24th at 
6:00pm - 7:00pm pacific time. Melee System Enhancements!).  Please read 
the information there before sending any feedback.

Melee characters can purchase tomes to learn the new melee skills from 
merchants in the north-east corner of West Commons.  Those same 
merchants can also teach the character the skill.  To learn the new 
skills, purchase the tome, then just hand the tome back to the merchant. 
  It won't work exactly like that when it goes Live, this is just to 
make getting the new skills convenient for testers.

There is a new window for using these skills.  You can open this window 
using ALT+C.  This is the window you use to place your skills (and 
activating those skills can be done either by clicking on the icon or 
hitting CTRL+#).  You can also create hotbuttons for the new skills.

You will know when an opening is available when a symbol appears in the 
new window.  Once the opening is available, skills that are available to 
use because of that opening will be enabled.

You cannot stack these skills.  If you have a skill effect on you and 
you activate another skill that affects you, it will overwrite the 
existing skill.  This is also true for disciplines.  A skill that 
affects the character will overwrite a discipline effect.


** Disciplines **

Disciplines have also been converted to the new system.  Please use them 
often, especially ones that you might not normally use, and let us know 
what you discover.

Disciplines now require the use of Endurance.  If you do not have enough 
Endurance, you will not be able to use the discipline.  Disciplines 
still have timers, so you will still have to wait until the discipline 
is available to use again, even if you do have enough Endurance to 
active it.


Thank you for helping us test these changes.
