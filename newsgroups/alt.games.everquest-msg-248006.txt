Lets say we have 6 clerics. The mob we're fighting and the tank
have mean we're going to have to CH the tank every 2 seconds
or so or he'll die. Lead cleric will call '/join clerichealchannel
and set up your keys'.

Once in the channel he calls 'CH order is cleric1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2 
second gap, 6 on spots' You happen to be 4.

You make a hotkey that looks something like

/cast <ch spell number>
/<channel number> -4- Casting CH on %T -4-

As your tank moves up to engage the mob you start the CH chain,
and will see in the channel something like:


6:clericheal Cleric1 tells the channel '-1- Casting CH on BigTank -1-'
<2 second pause>
6:clericheal Cleric2 tells the channel '-2- Casting CH on BigTank -2-'
<2 second pause>
6:clericheal Cleric3 tells the channel '-3- Casting CH on BigTank -3-'

Here you count 1 second from seeing the other persons heal message
then hit yours. Cast a tiny bit too fast to account for lag, delays in
your reaction, etc. 

If you fizzle, hit it again fast. Dont move because you're going to
get interrupted if you do. Call for help if a mob aggros on you. Dont
sit down - you have 2 seconds between heals, its pointless and you're
going to get aggro. Use a horse, or yaulp if the delay is long enough.

If you get called on 'spot heals' then watch for him getting dangerously
low and throw out a fast heal, or hit a CH if you count 3 seconds and
someone hasnt cast... Like....


6:clericheal Cleric1 tells the channel '-1- Casting CH on BigTank -1-'
<2 second pause>
6:clericheal Cleric2 tells the channel '-2- Casting CH on BigTank -2-'
<3 second pause>
6:clericheal You tell the channel '-GAP- Casting CH on BigTank -GAP-'


You'll also find more experienced clerics tend to gossip in the channel,
report mana (you need to make sure your mana is going down slower than
the mobs HP, dont forget to use mod rods), and sometimes give directions
like 'Faster heals', 'Slower heals', or 'Number 4 TOO SLOW FFS !!' 

Dont take offense if you get shouted at ;)

Finally, there may be an 'MA order' where they say 'MA1 is blah, SA is
blah, TA is bla'. 

If you have an MA/SA target the SA , then the MA, then refuse to target
anyone else. Your 'switch last target' key will now INSTANTLY give you
the SA if the MA dies so you can move the chain onto him. Stay in order
and with the right timings, let the first person to cast a CH be the right
number; if its you, carry on, if not, duck your heal and jump back in when
your spot comes up. Let the gap healers and druids/shamans cover emergency
heals till the chain is running again.


Splash heals are either touching up your group or the MA.

'Assist heals' mean having a hotkey that literally says '/assist'. You
target the mob with your mouse or F8, then /assist it and cast the fastest
heal you have on whoever its hitting. If the MA dies and your SA doesnt
take over, or the mob has dodgy aggro or theres just lots of mobs this
is the only way to know who to heal.

MGB heals will be once you have Mass Group Buff, a high point AA, you
cast a group heal with it and it heals everyone in range. Its useful when
the mob is casting area of effect spells that hurt everyone in range. it
may be called in a rotation similar to CH (Cleric one cast at 90%, cleric
2 at 80%, cleric 3 go at 60%) ,etc.

Advice: Pick up an extended range item (one drops in karnors keep tahts
cheapy) and a cheap horse ASAP.


Thats all I can think of now ;)
