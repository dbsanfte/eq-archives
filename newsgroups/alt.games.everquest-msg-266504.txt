You know what? you're right, I never thought about it like that!
I'm going to stop playing EQ this instant and go get a life (I must have
mislaid the last one).
Ohhh, I feel so liberated and new and light and fluffy and .............
Oooh look pretty EQ2!!!
hehe, get a life. I am managing to play EQ and take a degree and have a
life. How continuumly (not sure that's a word, heck, I just made it a word)
challenged you must be not to be able to play EQ and have a life. Try
getting some help for your addiction, and maybe STOP TROLLING!!!!!
Ceri :o)
