Ya know, if you'd just back off the insults, I might enjoy discussing this
with you...  I'm quite willing to admit that my knowledge and attitudes
might be out of date.  Sure, I believe Druids should be given something to
take the place of the ports, have some ability opened up to help redefine
their identity and allow them to be more useful to others...

I am NOT however, what everyone seems to THINK I am.  I'm not a habitual,
class-envy, chronic bitcher who's screaming that a change that is helping
most of the people in the game should be removed.  I'm willing to discuss
this, hell I WANT to discuss it or else I wouldn't have posted...

As for our abilities in groups, well...  I can't even debate that very well,
I'm only 44th level, and I'm one of the soloers you're talking about.  I've
played in groups, I've been told that I do well in groups, but what I have
going  for me is basic intelligence, and a willingness to put the members of
my group ahead of myself, NOT experience.  My play times are generally too
short for long sessions of grouping, although on the weekends I try...

Like I said elsewhere, I just found out about our new heal, although I'm a
LONG way from seeing that...  Generally, I spend my time in groups throwing
around SOW, snaring, using harmony to pull, and maybe some buffs or healing
depending on group makeup.  This of course is on top of my emergency duty of
maintaning enough mana for an evac and watching for the group leader to call
for it.

Most of my time is spent medding of course, but this seems common to casters
in a group.

Yes, I can be useful.  I don't feel exactly KEY, but I can be useful.


> I haven't noticed anybody calling Druids overpowered here recently.

Oops!  Well, you already responded to that!

It IS possible that things have changed, having been gone I might not have
noticed it...  Part of my annoyance here is based on all the dr00d bashing
that took place during my first few years on this group.  I'm FED UP with
the attitude and vitriol people poured on my class.

Still, if you think that's changed...  I'll watch awhile, but just in the
few days since I rejoined, I've already seen a few snide anti-druid
comments, just like the old days.

That would be nice.  We'll see what they do.  I would be happy if they just
removed the KOS settings and gave a bit more utility to our Share Wolf Form
spell.  That would allow us to use it as a defining feature of the class,
and make it more popular as a spell we could cast on others.

Now now.  When did I ever say that?  I said that being a "port bitch" was a
major part of our class's abilities, and they should REPLACE it, but other
than my not being as useful to my friends, I aint gonna miss it!

Well, this is almost CERTAINLY true.

So, when do you think they should put the free Ressurections in?
