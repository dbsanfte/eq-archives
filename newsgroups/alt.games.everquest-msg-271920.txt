EB games or Electronic Boutique has a few copies, not sure of the price
however- you can purchase online also (or you were able to last time I
looked).

My other half and I joined a really good aussie guild so we have found it
better to get more reliable groups.
Have you approached any?  Some of the bigger ones like Southern Cross and
Aurora Australis have closed their recruitment temporarily, but there are
others about to suit different types of players (ie older, family, raiding).

That being said though, we did round out our group with some non-guildies,
and we ended up wiping in the first fight.
The 2 other guys who were guilded were great about it, but the othe one was
going on in l33t speak about how we were all newbs and how much xp debt he
had and generally carrying on like a pork chop.
He ended up being kicked from the group where we picked up another person
who helped us with our shard recovery etc, and we invited him to stay.
He ended up dying about 12 times, he would not stay put when asked and I
think I ended up with about 45% debt which I am still working off.
You get that =)
It was only because of a guildie coming to TS that I recovered my 2 shards,
and given we have only been members for a couple of weeks I was really
impressed with the help we have received.

I don't think it matters what game you play you will always get the
griefers, idiots but also meet nice people along the way.
