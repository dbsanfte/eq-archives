Hell, I'm a coder and that stuff makes me sleepy, too.

Which, come to think of it, would have been handy last night. I
finally gave up trying to sleep at 4 am, got up and programmed until
8am, then finally went to sleep for a few hours.

It's going to kill me if I ever get a job where I have to keep normal
hours.
