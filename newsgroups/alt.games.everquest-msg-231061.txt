Just do the Shadowhaven Faction quest. Talk to Trade commissioner Henry. 
it simply invilves a trip to the bazaar, and a trip to fungus grove, and 
you get the Shadowhaven Amulet, which, when worn (ONLY item with a 
faction modifier in the game AFAIK) brings you up to Indifferent with 
all Shadowhaven factions.
