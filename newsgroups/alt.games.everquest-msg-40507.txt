Humm cunning. I just got a mindstorm set.
So do you have any plans ?

I'm guessing that you could build a trade skiller too.
However building a robot to control the mouse could be "non-trivial".

I seem to remember that there used to be joysticks that could be
programed with special moves. I wonder if you could get a mouse like
that. Have the mouse record "make metal bit" then go get some coffee.

I love pipe dreams.
