Though I laughed back then at what Mythic thought was giving the
players what they were asking for in terms of horses (and still think
it was a bone thrown to allow them to claim to be the first 3d mmorpg
with horses), in terms of fast transport I have to agree, Mythic got
it more right than post-Luclin Sony did.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
