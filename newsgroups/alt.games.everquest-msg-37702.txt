	Stonebrunt was designed "from the bottom up as a TCC area", and it
contains a quest that simply can't be done without short-circuting the TCC in
some way.

	Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.

	Verant has had 2.5 years now to show us what they're capable of.  They've
shown us that they can't do basic math: can't balance faction choices, can't
balance risk versus reward, can't deal with their own restrictions.  There is
no reason to expect any improvement in Luclin.
