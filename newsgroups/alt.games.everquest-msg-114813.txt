    Things on my plate:

(1) Go to Vex Thal to see what's there. That means raiding or killing a ton
of stuff.
(2) Get my tradeskills capped. I've decided (now that I have all the
cross-religion Imbues scribed) that I'd like to have my grandmaster skill be
Pottery, especially now that a high quality item (infinite right-click
charges of Port to Home Temple) can be made with it.
(3) Get my Alt XP up where it should be. Right now I'm six points away from
Mass Group Buff, which is damn-near required for a cleric. After that I'll
be able to play around a lot more with where I spend points. Soon I will no
longer be Pokey, the Run Speed One cleric!
(4) Level up the alts (all seven of them) and get them geared up on rots.
Running my 31 necromancer through several zones of hostile reds to loot a
13/20 15 STR/INT 80 MANA/HPs scythe was a load of fun!
(5) Do quests. Some of the quests on my plate right now are 6th (then 7th
and 8th) Coldain Prayer Shawl, cleric epic, emperor key (one piece left),
shackle of steel for my monk, Ragebringer for my rogue....

    I'd say that should keep you busy. It sure keeps ME busy!
