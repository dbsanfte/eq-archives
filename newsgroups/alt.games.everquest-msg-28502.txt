As a general rule of thumb, its WIS times (level /5)

So at level 25, each point of WIS is worth 5 mana
While at level 50, each point is worth 10 mana

Add to this total any +mana items.

WIS (and INT) hit a soft cap for mana at 200, though,
so that every point over 200 gives you one more point
of mana, instead of following the calculation above.

At low levels, +mana items are more desirable than
+WIS items, since each point of WIS represents only
a couple mana anyway.  At high levels, where you
have good equipment and usually have an enchanter
buffing your WIS up past the 200 level, the +mana
items are again important, when suddenly that +20
mana piece of crap you used when you were tenth level
again boosts your mana total more than an Uber +15 wis
belt would!
