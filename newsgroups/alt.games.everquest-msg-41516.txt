A lot of time and effort seems to have been made with that post (not much
thought if you ask me, of all the quotes you could have taken from Bizbee's
posting history you seem to have found some of the more unassuming ones) I
wonder if maybe you should worry less about what Biz does or does not with
his life and start working on your own.

The "your mother still owes me" line just about killed off all credibility
your post may have had.

What exactly was this meant to achieve, upset Bizbee? Cool, do you think it
worked? Do you think he posts his opinions to make friends?

3/10 for effort
