What makes it really funny is that there are a limited number of things that
you can do on quests in pretty much every MMORPG.  Kill things.  Deliver
things.  Go to specific places.  Talk to specific NPCs.  So, if you just
look at *what* you do, they look boring.  It is the story behind them that
makes them interesting.

This reminds me of a beta for another game I was in.  When I started the
beta, they had not yet named the spells, so I had things like "Ice Nuke 1",
"Ice Nuke 2", "Ice Nuke 3", "Fire Nuke 1", "Armor Buf 1", "Armor Buf 2", and
so on.  When the patch went in that gave the spells names, it totally
changed the feel of the class, even though nothing changed there except the
spell names.  Simply having names, like "Frost Blast", "Chilling Blast",
"Frigid Blast", etc., made a big difference.
