Is your Heat/Sink and fan adaquate for that CPU?

Is the BIOS for the motherboard up to date (ie supports the CPU
natively?). Check the voltage being delivered to the CPU. It is
possible that the motherboard is delivering too much power if it is
misidentifying the CPU. (since you mentioned the MB automatically sets
up the CPU)
