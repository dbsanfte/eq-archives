Yes it does - I suffered the same problem and could not work out by the
damage being done by the pet if they had an effect as it appeared to do the
same damage by the on screen messages.  But what I could tell is the target
died faster and I had to heal pet less. Its obvious they must get more HP
but I can only assume the weapons allow the pet to land hits more often
rather than misses.
