Actually, you can fish from a boat. It's a little tricky, but once you
get the knack, it's pretty easy.

Stand near the edge of the boat and try to fish. If its says you
"..must be on dry land to fish", step back a bit. If it says
"...trying to catch landsharks", step forward a bit. Eventually, you
will narrow down where to stand. The real problem is that when the
boat turns, the spot you have to stand moves and you will have to
recalibrate.
