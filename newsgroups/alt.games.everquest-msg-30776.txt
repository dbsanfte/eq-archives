For one thing. get out of Gfay... that place is too overcrowded with weird
people and orc hill is where they seem to congregate...
If you wanna stay on that continent, there are some great places in
Steamfont Mountains which isn't far. The skele spawn was mentioned and if
you can get in a group there are things to be hunted around the windmills.
There is also decent hunting in Butcherblock which is an even shorter run
than Steamfont.
If you don't mind relocating, there is always East Commons and Misty Thicket
isn't a bad place to hunt either...provided you are not an evil race.
