Unfortunately, they probably could.  I mean, think about it... AOLers keep

Well, it -would- be equal, because we would all be equally able to buy 
uber gimped characers we didn't know how to play.  That's why I play, too, 
so it would ruin it for me, but I think other people would just find a 
different 'point'.  I don't think it's a 'point' that would appeal to me, 
though.

Now, that's a pretty interesting idea.  Hmm... 

}People who like the idea of buying

Well, it wouldn't destroy it.  It would just change it.  It would change 
it to a game that in my opinion lacked a certain sort of integrity, and 
therefore one I wouldn't be interested in, but it probably wouldn't desroy 
it.
