I wasn't clear in my original post...I meant for when invis drops.  And
no, I don't expect them to do it, quite the opposite.  But people who have
the ability to take care of it themselves will always be my first choice,
whether by potions or innate ability, because sneaking in past mobs for
event_x has always been an important part of pulling off over half of what
we can pull off.

Are you, ahem, as fired up at me now that you understand my clarification,
or you have some more rhetorical questions you'd like to machine-gun at
me? *grin*
