At least you'd be doing better than my in-laws. When we told them I was
pregnant with child #1 they informed me that if i ever used "any of that
psychobabble shit" on their grandchild they'd sue for custody.

That's the thing, you never "reach" anything.  Self-actualization, according
to Maslow, is a continual process of learning and growing.  You can always
learn more about yourself, you can always learn more about the world around
you, you are always progressing in your knowledge of the world.

unfortuantely the world of social sciences tends to move away from
quantifiable numbers.  In my statistics courses we used terms like
"statistically significant percentage of difference.

Welcome to my world.  I have these thoughts about these little theories and
studies and teatieses all the time -- often in the most bizaare places.

Yes, it was Piaget who came up with the first developmental/educational
scale.  I really like Piaget's scale because he uses a process of
developmental readiness based on the individual, what the individual has
progressed through, and what the individual is ready for.  Piaget never
referred to concrete numbers or age references as stages at which a child is
to be able for a certain task (though he does provide an approximate range).

Another gentleman who thought along these lines was Fredrich Froebel
(http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-froeb.htm).  Froebel, in addition to
believing that education involved steps to be progressed upon when the
individual was ready, also believed very strongly in "hands-on" learning.
For this reason he's been one of my favorite heroes in the world of
education.

For the most part, PDA's are there to fulfill either an exteme need for
affection (the individual cannot wait to have their need met due to some
feeling that they won't have another chance) or an extreme need for
attention.  If both of these needs are met on a regular basis in a more
positive situation, the need for the PDA ceases.
