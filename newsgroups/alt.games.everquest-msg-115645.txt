That sucks.

I personally have a price that I will pay -- 15pp -- that I try to meet.
Sometimes I give more.  Sometimes I'm broke.  When someone asks for more, I
remind them that it doesn't cost a thing for a druid to port me somewhere,
and if they don't appreciate what I'll pay them, then that's their problem,
not mine.  I'm not too proud to run across Antonica if I have to.

Ironically, I have yet to meet a Wizard who will accept my donation. . .
