How do you propose we handle North Korea differently?

"There were connections between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's
government. We don't disagree on that."
-Lee Hamilton, 9/11 committee Vice Chairman.

"What we have found is, were there contacts between Al Qaeda and Iraq?
Yes, some of them were shadowy - but they were there."
-Thomas Kean, 9/11 commission Chair.

"He has supported and harbored terrorist groups, particularly radical
Palestinian groups such as Abu Nidal, and he has given money to
families of suicide murderers in Israel."
-John Kerry, October 2002 (before the success of Howard Dean convinced
him that he should actually oppose the war rather than support it)

Rewarding the families of Suicide Bombers.  Housing and protecting Abu
Nidal and his terrorist organization.  Housing and protected Abu Abbas
and allowing him to operate from Baghdad.  Housing Al-Queda operatives
(and pretending they didn't know they were there).

Yeah, Iraq had nothing to do with terrorism.

Iraq is now the ultimate terrorist training and recruitment ground?

This was in response to the implication that Bush was pissing off

So you say.  The facts do not agree.
