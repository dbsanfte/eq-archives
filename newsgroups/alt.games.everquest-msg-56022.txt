Unless they changed it (and that happens a lot) this is true only of exp res's.  I've
happily been Revived by a paladin, then resed my own body and got the full 90%
rebate.

On the other hand, I concur, a 50% exp won't let you later get the remaining
40% by ressing with a 90%, much less give you 140% total as it might if
they really "stacked."  What an exploit that would be though!
