I've seen enough to make me believe this to be true also.  I have seen GMs 
talking to us in /guildchat, and I have seen a GM wearing my guildtag on 
screenshots (I *think* it was on eqretard.com for a while).  There is no 
logical reason at all to think that GMs can't insert themselves in any 
guild and monitor /guildchat while remaining GM invis.
