Yeah, this strategy is predicated on the OOCombat regen rate, which is 
equal for both bars, regardless of your HP regen, mana regen, and/or the 
size of either pool.

Its interesting though to keep your bars more or less even all the time; 
  consider that despite having different sized bars, if your mana bar is 
tiny and you use it in small sips, its the same as if its huge and 
you're going thru big gulps.  And if your regen is slow, using a little 
at a time so it regens acceptably, its the same as if your regen is fast 
and you're going thru the bar faster.
