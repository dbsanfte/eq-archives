What it means is that it wouldn't hurt you to watch what's going on
over there, either with F9 or turning around quickly for a peek.

Here's how you tell.  If the mob is standing all by himself not
beating on anyone, it's rooted.  If your caster is performing his
getting beat up animation, it's not.  Seems pretty simple to me.

You keep wanting to make this a failure on my part, and I don't think
it is.  Does your wife's root always work perfectly?  Does she never
get mobs on her?  And incidentally, do you play in the same room so
that she can just _say_ to you "need some help here" or whatever?

No, not necessarily.  Some of us find the outdoor,
pull-one-or-at-most-two-blues style of play rather dull.  As I've said
before, in Paw (and most other dungeons, for that matter) you simply
are occasionally going to get lots of adds.  Nothing you can do about
it.

OK, let's say then that they *were* paying attention but were
thinking, as you apparently do, "hey, crowd control isn't my job, I
just whack away until someone yells for help."  You have said
repeatedly that tanks shouldn't have to help with crowd control.

I say that, in the absence of a dedicated crowd control class like an
enchanter, you're dead wrong.  In that situation it is the tanks' (or
one of the tank's, anyway) responsibility to keep mobs off the
casters.  Not the tank's job alone, mind you, the other casters can
help, but the tank's *as well*.  That's the tank's job, keeping the
mobs on him.  The designated tank should be watching for mobs
attacking the casters, maybe positioning himself so he looks back in
at the party when you all start attacking the initial target.  Or
using F9.  Should a caster yell for help if he's getting beat up?
Sure.  But should the tanks also be paying attention to what's going
on with the casters?  Most definitely.

Judging from the responses to my post, a lot of other people feel at
least similarly to the way I do.
