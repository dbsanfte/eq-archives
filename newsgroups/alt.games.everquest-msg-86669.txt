Not high enough yet, but since each AA point is as much exp as 51 takes, my
plan is to do 100% exp to almost 53, then go to 90% AA and live in 52 until
I get AA run 3, then swap over to 10% AA until 60, barring anything unusual.

The reason for prolonging 52 long enough to get run3 is to enable me to go
on as many vox/naggy raids as I can  =P  And the fact that run3 is quite
possibly the most useful of the AA abilities, especially since it works
indoors and can't be dispelled.
