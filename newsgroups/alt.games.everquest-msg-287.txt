You misread the statement. I requested for there  to be an in  game mail
system in addition to the /gu  command. They never added the postal system.

My point was, you can usually spot a train coming  from  a distance...
enough time to either start running or to  hold your ground, cast invis, use
a hde skill.. to adjust properly. If you cant react well in the face of
danger, then you get killed by the train. People hanging around the higher
level areas can figure out how to survive a train. I can't tell you how many
times in the beta that I used my ranger's hide command when I saw Dvinn
running around like a madman in Crushbone.

The main argument was is that people can function without the /shout
channel. If you can recognize a train from  agood distance, you should have
adequate time to react and survive, instead of relying on someone shouting
"train to zone" ...Besides, if someone had to say that, they normally post
it on both the shout and ooc board.
