I understand some people may think I'm an ass for going against the
convention but if I see something I disagree with I can't just fall in
line and go with it.

Now this may mean some people will ignore my posts, either requests
for info or providing it.  Other people may not care.  Either way I
accept the consequences and realize everything comes with a price.

I think my reasons are rational and valid and I usually try not to be
an ass, this instance included.
