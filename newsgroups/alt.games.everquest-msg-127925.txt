This has to be the biggest "No shit" comment in this entire thread.
It's about religion.  Religion, at least the christian religion and
its many offspring (cue somebody commenting on the fact that
christendom is and offshoot of judaism), is about faith.  And from the
looks of it, you either have it or you don't.  And I don't see one
state as better than the other to be honest.
