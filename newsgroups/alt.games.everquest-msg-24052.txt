From what I have read elsewhere, wolf form puts you in to indifferent with
most faction, not only when you are lower faction but higher, as well. Same
with sneak. You need to be amiable in order to get the stein, so as a druid
it just ain't going to happen, no matter how high your Clurg faction. You
have to build your faction with Da Bouncers (*I think* that is the right
group) to dubious, at least, then ditch wolf form. By the time you do that,
you can PL several enchanters to do the run for you.  It used to be that
druids and rogues *could* get the stein, but the farming was so bad that
Verant changed it to require amiable, at least.

In short, you can't get there from here.
