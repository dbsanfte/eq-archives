There are quite a few products that will solve this.  I will assume you are
using Ethernet between your DSL Modem & computer.  You just need to get
a hold of a small router of some sort.  The link below is for a Linksys one
that would do the trick.

We have tried a bunch of different products at work for at-home users and
found this one to be the easiest to use and pretty cheap.  ($100-$150)  Even
with that there are dozens of other companies that make competing products
you could look at.  I'm sure your local computer store has something of this
sort in stock also.
