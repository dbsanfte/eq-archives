That would be sad if that were true and the players weren't the -second- 
line of defense against bugs.  Any time you add functionality to an app, it 
should be tested, and assuming it wasn't just my machine, this wasn't 
tested with any decent amount of text in the text area.

I do enough QC / QA at work on my code and other peoples' code.  I don't 
play on the test server because I don't feel like doing that after I leave 
work, and I'm not the type that has to be the first one to see / do 
something.

Verant has their own QC, and it ain't the best.
