Well, yes the graphics engine in EQ was great in it's development phase but
by time of release it was already on it's downward slide as 3Dfx was too. By
the 1st year and the release of the first expansion they had already
upgraded their graphics big time and some of the cards you used at release
were already outdated. I just hope by the time EQ2 comes out that it's
engine is not already on it's way out. Eighteen months is a long time in the
computer technology time scale.

I upgrade my computer every two years or so and the system I have now will
play it NOW as they state the system requirements at this time. That's the
key word, Time. Hell, 18 months down the road is a long road in computer
technology. I will bet by the time EQ2 comes out there will be better ways
to lower the 3D vertices count as well as the phong/shading count etc. I'd
love to have a toon walk up to a mirror or body of water and see my
reflection, but that would be really heavy on the graphics engine not to
mention coding it to reflect MObs. Ripples in your reflection when looking a
t the water sounds awesome but we're at least 5 years from that computer
wise I would think. Would be a bandwidth eater as well, but I digress.

I too am going to be following the EQ2 development and will be trying to get
in on the Beta testing as I was in 3rd and 4th beta of EQ. My computer ran
EQ real well in the beta and release. They say all you need is a PIII to
play and 512 Mb/RAM. By release I bet it will be at least a P IV or better
as well as everything else upgraded as well. Who knows, it's hard to say.
