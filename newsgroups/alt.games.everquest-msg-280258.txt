	Well, they successfully addressed a lot of my concerns and I'm back 
already.

	One reason why this free thing will have limited effect is that half 
the population has skipped servers, so a lot of the people returning 
will want to server-move to be with their friends, which Sony charge 
$75US for. [with equipment]

	So the 'free' 25 days really means $75 plus DoN plus Omens in some cases.

	We know damn well the process of moving a character from one server to 
another is well automated these days - we just saw tens of thousands of 
moves go through in a few months - but they think they can get away with 
$75US for it. That's why Sony are slowly being reamed on all fronts, 
they're just too damn greedy.

	I'm talking to three friends as we speak, all of whom would undoubtedly 
come back to play if it didn't cost them to move servers, and probably 
two of them would get addicted again. As it is, I doubt any will return 
because they're unwilling to fork out $75US each to come and join me on 
my new server.

	If you ask me, they should offer 28 days and a free move per account.

	Also, they should be offering 30 days free for new accounts, locked to 
the newbie server with a free move at any time after the account becomes 
billable. And they should be marketing the *crap* out of that offer.

cheers,
James
