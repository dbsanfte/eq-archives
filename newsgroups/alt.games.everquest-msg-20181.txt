First, I wouldn't have discussed the name thing in guildchat, if you did
that after you found out it was a guildy.  You're just setting yourself up
for bad feelings.

I'm NOT saying that you shouldn't have petitioned...I probably wouldn't have
bothered (I petition names I find stupid or names that are vulgar/promote
illegal activity), but that's just me.  I just think you were asking for
trouble admitting to it in guild chat.

I get the feeling that you joined a guild that /ooc'd looking for members,
and they didn't really care if you were a stranger or not.  I mean, a really
juvenile guild (just 'cause the leader is married doesn't make him mature).

What should you do?  You should apologize to your friend that took you in
and made you an officer.  Tell him you were being stupid (because you were).
You should also target yourself and do a /guildremove out of your current
juvenile guild.  With any luck your friend will forgive your stupidity and
invite you back in.
