Ok.  I will play along just this one time and that's it.  Like I said
in my post, I don't get involved in this trivial BS, I am here to
learn as much as I can about EQ.  I have been using usenet since the
early 90s, and while in the past I have gotten involved in these types
of discussions more often, I rarely do anymore since they are almost
always pointless and serve no purpose, just silly and immature
arguments that clog up a newsgroup and waste a lot of peoples time,
because they have to wade through the BS to get what they are after.

Yes, I have posted here, but I am mostly a lurker.  I don't post
unless I have a question that hasn't already been asked, or unless I
have valuable insight to offer.  And as I mentioned, I don't get
involved in all the BS here, so of course I don't post to those
threads.  I am a relative newbie to the game, having only played a
little over a month, so I don't have a great deal of insight to
provide, I am still mainly in the question mode.  I started a thread
called "A Couple of Newbie Ranger Questions and Comments".  It turned
out to be a really good thread with all kinds of good information.
One of the reasons I replied to Eric is because he offered me all
kinds of valuable information in that thread.

On the Gamespot issue.  They have done these type of interviews for
years.  I really don't think they could get away with falsifying
something one of the key people involved in the development would say.
If they did, I am sure you would find a comment on the official EQ
site, and Gamespot would have to retract their article.  This doesn't
mean that the development team will not change their minds and come up
with something completely different, it could happen.

I just get a little tired of all the unwarranted  flames and hostility
on this NG, where people use such inflammatory words such a "moron".
I realize you didn't explicitly call Jo a moron, but you implied
she/he was being lead around by morons when she/he wasn't.

A lot of you guys (more of a general comment here, not referring to
you specifically, since I don't know that much about you) have a lot
of EQ experience under your belts and have a lot of valuable
information you can offer, and do from time to time.  But you also
lose a lot of credibility with all the negative crap you get involved
in.  I see one prominent poster and experienced EQer post complaining
about the servers being down one day, and then flamming someone for
complaining on the following day.  I mean, jeeze, give me a break.
And then the elitist attitude (which is nothing unique to this NG,
found on most) that, you're comments aren't of any value, if you are
not one of the frequent posters (who are frequently the ones involved
in all the BS).
