I'm not saying SOE should implement everything everyone ever
wishes for here in alt.games.everquest.  But input from players
is still valuable.

It tells me that a lot of people are immature and don't have
anything better to do than tell other people to shut up.  In
fact, I think, for example, that monks could be nerfed down to
the same offense/defense tables as wizards, and half the anti-
whine usenet nazis in a.g.e would be telling monks to quit
whining and how it's funny monks are finally nerfed back to
where they belong, etc. etc.  There's a very VERY vocal group
of people here in a.g.e who, apparently, think that SOE can do
no wrong.

Disclaimer: I don't play a monk.

Yes, I do think it's likely some SOE employees read this newsgroup,
and I do think things posted to forums like a.g.e can affect the
game.  No, of course everyone doesn't share the same viewpoint.
