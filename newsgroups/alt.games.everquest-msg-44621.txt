I usually figure it means that you target the critter who everyone is
attacking and /assist it.  If the person he's hitting needs a heal, heal.

If not, do /assist again to get back to the critter, and /assist one more
time to see if someone new is being hit.

A couple shortcuts might be an assist button or simply /as (my choice).
