> Advice for first time beginer? Helpful websites where i can read up?

Here's all the sites I use for verious references:

I use this mainly for the item look up and to find quests:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

This will help you navagate Norrath:
http://www.eqatlas.com/

In case you get into tradeskilling:
http://www.eqtraders.com/articles/news_page.php?menustr=010000000000

This is good for a list of spells.  It also has detailed descriptions of
each class, their skills, and creation guides:
http://eq.crgaming.com/menu/spells_old.asp (that's a link to their old spell
list.  I find it more informative than the new one.)

This will tell you which ldon merchant sells what and for how much:
http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi

In case you ever want to dye your armor:
