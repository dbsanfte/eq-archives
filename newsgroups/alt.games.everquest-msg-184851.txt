That's just ridiculous. I can't believe the people that live their
lives around EQ. So, she left her husband and kids, kids no less, so
she can find some other freak that thinks EQ is a way of life.
These people are going to end up killing themselves when EQ finally
does shut down and they realize they have nothing to talk about any
more.
