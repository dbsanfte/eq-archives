  Well, not entirely true.  Many caster classes will have difficulty
with Gix when he's an even/high blue con because he's got very high
magic resist.  This (plus his ability to snare and Harm Touch) makes
him a little more difficult than most even/blue cons around this
level, but he should still be doable with a little luck.
