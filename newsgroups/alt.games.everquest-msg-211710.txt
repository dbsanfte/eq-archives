We both fairly much made assertions.  I've proved it to my satisfaction,
however my logs from those periods are long gone in various OS reinstalls.
I'm not about to go back and do it all again because of a disagreement on a
newsgroup; I'm not that bored with my life!

Many people follow the "rangers are signifigantly worse at tanking" line of
thought in the pre-50th world ... and I found it just was not so.  Many
times pre-50th I tanked simply because I could hold aggro better than
warriors ... course pally/SK would have been just as good there.
