In most encounters, a level 56 paladin or shadowknight will want a
good 1hs in primary and a stat/AC item in their off-hand. At 50+ and
particularly 55+, tanks are more valuable for their ability to SOAK UP
damage than to dish it out. You're rarely going to find a 2hs that
gives you the stats that you'll get from a Sarnak Battle Shield in
your off hand and a Centi Longsword in your primary.

Besides that, your ability to taunt and hold aggro is directly related
to how *often* you hit. While 2hs weapons often have better ratios
than 1hs, you'll never find one with a delay to compare to a
Lamentation or MoSS.
