Our server had a patch on friday night, so 5 mins before it shuts down, I
log off on the end of the dock on south qeynos. I come back after the patch,
and I appear in some blueish looking room ive never seen before, then a
couple of seconds later I apppear on the boat going back from erudin to
qeynos, in eruds crossing.

The rest of the character seems intact... all items and money. Weird.
