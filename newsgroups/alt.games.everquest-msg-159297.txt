Ya prolly don't remember me, I've taken about a 1 1/2 year hiatus from
EQ.  Now I'm back, and even got the wife into EQ as well.  Which is
great, because it lessens the complaining on her part about my EQ
playing.

Anyway, just wanted to say it's great to see you are still here
helping the ones with real questions, whilst harrasing the idiots.
Keep up the good work.  BTW, is there a FAQ for this newsgroup yet?
