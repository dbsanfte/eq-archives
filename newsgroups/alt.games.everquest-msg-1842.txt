The times I've run into problems near the tower, are when the guards have
just been killed by Hill Giants, the zone is a long way away when you have
several Griffawns, Griffenes, and/or Griffons on you.  The guards got killed
off while I was fighting, I see that too many have joined in the fight, so I
run for the tower.  Oops, no guards, start for zone, don't get very far.
