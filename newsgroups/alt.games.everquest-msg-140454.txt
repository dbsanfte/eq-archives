In twentyfive years of playing "pen and paper" and CRPGs, I've
never had much intrest in playing clerics.  Even in EQ, I didn't
consider trying them out.  Played Mage, Rogue, Necro... then
I joined a guild that was short on clerics, and the guildleader
made an open offer to equip the first cleric to hit 20 with
(gasp) full plate.  I decided to try it out.  By the time I hit
20 the GL was on vacation, I was 30 by the time he got
back, 40 by the time he got around to actually coming thru
on his offer... but by that point I'd outleveled everyone in
the guild and was supplying -him- with gear!

Turns out I really really like EQ clerics.  If I get time and
nearby players again, I'll probably try a similar class in
pen and paper gaming, maybe I'll like it after all.

The myth that clerics are limited to one style of play is, I think,
quite destructive to the longevity of cleric players.  As a result,
most clerics drop out, or are played as PL'd alts or as second
character BOT's to use with people's mains.  Clerics heal, yes,
very well.  But they can also be integral parts of a fear kite,
use stun tactics, crowd control with Root (and possibly atone)
nuke, melee, sponge, solo via root/nuke/reroot or by undead
DOT, AOE... why there's really not a lot clerics can't contribute,
if you let them.  They are less efficient at all those things than
classes more dedicated to them, and than they are at healing....
but its a heck of a lot more fun to use a variety of styles instead
of sticking to heal and sit for 60 levels.

I partner with a druid buddy a lot.  No, make that A LOT.
We don't quad, though, we kill 6 or 8 at a time.  I mean,
quadding is so inefficient.

I did try quadding with my druidling, and while it is amusing,
I'm dropping 4 low blues when I could be killing one light red...
he's spent 34 levels killing red and yellow mobs, the thrill of
killing four of something he was killing singles of 10 levels ago
really isn't all that.  Thing is, while druid is a useful, powerful,
and versatile class, it just doesn't grab me the way cleric has.

Tried it.  Too powerful.  No challenge.  And I like helping people..
there's very little of that in a necro.  I ran a necro to 20 and a second
one to 22.  Might I like it better at 50?  Dunno, not likely to find
out since I didn't care much for the first 20odd levels, who's going
to do another 30 just to find out?

I'll say this again, as I do every time its mentioned. Tanks should NOT
be "trying to get the mobs off the cleric"  Stop it.  Please for the love
of Brell do your job and stop trying to do the chanter's job.. if we
don't have a chanter I'll do it myself!

I haven't managed to get a chanter over 6th or so before losing interest.
I do have a 40 bard (my first bard went to 19) that is my "real alt",
and does an excellent job of controling the minds of mobs, "lets
you and he fight" is his favorite tactic.  Bard, I think, is the class
most
different from all the others.  I've played a ranger to 10, rogue to 15,
beastlord to 19 or so, shadowknight to 9 a couple times... also a monk
to 9 I think.  I just don't have a lot of fun with melee classes; most of
my characters over most of that 25 years of gaming were also casters
or in SF games, some kind of tech expert or psionic.

I tried that, but finding a group of like minded friends who
play frequently enough on the same schedule has thus far
proved elusive.  Instead I end up playing the character
on his own, with pickup players.  Best times have been
with a single like minded partner, and with occaisional
power boost by me buffing her alt and her main buffing my
alt... which is where I got to 40 bard, alongside her 40 monk.

This is why I've stuck to the bard, its an alternate class I've really
enjoyed, powerful yet not too powerful, mixed in abilities and
styles of play, radically different from anything else I've gone with.
While I find beastlord interesting and might like to work mine up
higher, this would just be a distraction.

What interests me about running another cleric, though, is that
I have a much better idea now about whats really important,
and some ideas about what might have been much better choices
to make.  In particular, since I

Bah, with only a single AA to my name, I'm less than halfway thru
the game as a cleric.  Funny thing, no matter how high I go, I
still feel like a lowbie
