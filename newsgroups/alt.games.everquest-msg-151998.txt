Procs tash? Nice. However, could it possibly proc often enough (don't
know what your wizzie's DEX is) to make it useful enough to warrant
your meleeing over medding/nuking? If you're meleeing, tash isn't
gonna help *you*, is it? Can your damage output possibly compare with
your nuking output? Curious.
