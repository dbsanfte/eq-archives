Exactly. So, at level 12, you cannot group with anyone higher than level 18,
if you want to get xp.

It is, however, not 100% accurate always. I remember being a level 19
magician many years ago, and teaming with a level 30 warrior in Paw. I still
got exp. from that. But as a rule of thumb, it's 1.5 times your level.
