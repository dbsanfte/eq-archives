  Yeah, my system is similar, a little faster (Athlon XP 1700+, 1 GB of DDR
memory, same graphics card) and I'm okay in all zones except certain Luclin
ones (Grimling Forest and Shar Vahl) at 1024x768 with the clipping plane all
the way out, spell effects on, and all models on.  In the named zones frame
rates get a bit laggy (down to 10-15 FPS I'd estimate when it gets bad), or
in raid situations where there's 30+ characters on the screen at the time.
If I bring back the clipping plane, and/or turn off spell effects, I seldom
experience poor frame rates... and it's basically always playable.

  So Luclin is a bit of a monster, but you don't need a monster of a system
to play it, though it helps if you demand smooth frame rates at high
resolutions without sacrificing too much in the way of visual quality.
