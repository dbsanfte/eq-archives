   Wise choice.  I like playing the Sims.  I like like playing EQ
alot more than the single person roleplaying games I used to
play.  I thought TSO would be a natural for me.

   Wrongo.  This is one of the boringest games I have ever
played.  And uneasy mix of an chatroom unsorted by interests and
an annoying avatar to keep alive.  Lots and lots of downtime,
either studying to improve the payout of job objects, working
away at job objects themselves at 4 minutes a pop.  Not very much
in the way of things to do in terms of game driven content, save
for buying a house and decorating it, which you can do just fine
in the off line version.

  I still have an active account to TSO, but only because they
gave me a free month when I called up to cancel due to Boredom. 
And yes, you do have to call up to cancel, rather than doing
through the web site.  What a mess!

Annie
