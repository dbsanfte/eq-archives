I'm trying not to flame...
You may ofcourse block whomever you want from your site but please atleast
if you are going to put up some reasoning on the page, use some real info
like "M$ is evil empire of the dark overlord" instead of publishing such
fcsk(8):ing utter bullshit.
You have prolly last used IE4 or something. There is completelly valid png
support, and IE6 has excellent support for CSS.
The abuaseable buglist would have been much more relevant to put up (with
precise revision list too).

Damn. I slipped into flaming after all.
Anyways. I use Mozilla&opera on my windows machine and Nettrap on Linux.
I'm just angry because i can't waste my time here at work browsing your
site. WAAA!

Nettrap, Mozilla, Opera and IE all suck. I dont bother reasoning anything
here. Would just start flamewar.

Only browser that i have nothing bad to say about is Lynx. uh, no wait. I'd
like to be able to use my bank account with that. Is there some SSL thingie
for that?

Thank's for the great site. I really like it even thou i dont use the hacks
to get myself banned. I hope your work encourages Verant to reconsider how
much of the ingame data they store on client-side.
