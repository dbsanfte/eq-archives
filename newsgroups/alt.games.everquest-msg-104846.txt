Your weapon skills cap lower than a melee class. You are caster first, melee
second. Never forget that.

Until you have characters in their 30s or higher, money is VERY hard to come
by. Look for things that other players are buying. Sell bone chips,
batwings, HQ pelts. Offer SoW for donations. Buy stuff at low prices and
sell at higher in the next zone or the next day.

Good luck!
