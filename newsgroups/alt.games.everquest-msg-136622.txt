In some parts of the world, people have no choice in who they leave 
their estate to. For example, in Brazil, where I do research, by law one 
half of the joint property of a married couple belongs to the husband 
and one half to the wife.  Half of the man's half must be evenly divided 
among all the "children of his body"  (no matter who the mother and 
whether he is married to her) and one half of the woman's half also goes 
to her biological children.  Each member of the couple can designate an 
heir or heirs for the remaining share of their share.  But they have no 
choice about the division among legal heirs.  (the only exceptions are 
that if a married man gives property to a woman who is not his wife and 
with whom he maintains a sexual and economic relationship, his wife can 
claim that property and it does not become joint property.  So if you 
are a cheating Brazilian husband, give your property to your 
girlfriends' children rather than your girlfriend herself! And then if a 
man marries a widow or divorcee, half of the property she brings into 
the marriage is saved for division among her heirs from the first marriage).

I think this system is called "forced succession" or something.  The 
major thing about it is that property owners have no choice about the 
disposition of much of their estate -- they are seen as custodians of 
family property rather than individual owners. My understanding is that 
under the English based law in most of the US (except for 
Louisiana)property holders have the right to designate whatever heirs 
they want.  Biological and adopted children do not have an automatic 
right to their parents' property. For example, I had a fellowship at the 
Getty museum which was built by Getty and was his major heir. His five 
sons contested his leaving the millions to the museum, but lost.  One of 
the reasons they were able to build such a huge campus and have such a 
generous fellowship program is that they inherited the bulk of his oil 
billions.  (The other reason is the bull market and smart investing by 
the Getty foundation).
