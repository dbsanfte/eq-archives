I was in SK with my level 24 necro picking on the raiders for faction.  This one odd
caster (still called "a raider" like the others) spawned and I didn't think anything of it
- until he killed my pet and nearly me and still had over half life left.  I zoned out and
medded up.  Returned with pet and full mana and proceeded to beat on him again.
After about 15 minutes of beating, he took off running with my pet in pursuit - and still
had over 2 red bulbs of health left!  Lost them both for a while as I was burdened, but
finally caught up with them under the NK bridge.  Pet was still beating away and the mob
was down to 1 red bulb.  I jumped in with Woe and it still took another 5 minutes or so to
kill him.  So, being the inquisitive person I am, I decided to get him to spawn again and
log the entire combat this time.  Brought my level 34 druid in from my other account and
grouped.  He snared to pull to open groun so he wouldn't run into the water like last
time.  Once he was out and rooted I set the log running and had the pet beat away.  My
necro nuked 10 times for 146dmg each and ran out of mana.  Had her auto follow the druid
and proceeded to beat on him along with the pet.  Once he finally died, I used one of the
log analyzers to see what the results were. Here's the results:

Damage Output for my necro:

Type	Total	Hits	Average	Min	Max
non-melee	1460	10	146.00	146	146

Damage Output for necro pet and druid:

Name	Damage	Total	Hits	Average	Min	Max
Nukkilhed	crush	1345	227	5.93	1	15
Nukkilhed	{Total}	1345	227	5.93	1	15
Zonann	bash	414	113	3.66	1	8
Zonann	kick	108	45	2.40	1	8
Zonann	pierce	5911	519	11.39	1	26
Zonann	{Total}	6433	677	9.50	1	26
{Total} (5 mobs)	{Total}	8683	1021	8.50	1	26

So here we have a mob that cons green to a level 24 necro, with an estimated (there may
have been points where I was out of range of the damage messages) hit point total of 9238.
Needless to say this has been reported as a bug.  Anyone else run across this before?
Heh, I was hoping the faction increases would be on par with the toughness of the mob, but
alas, my necro was still KOS to NK guards after taking him down 3 times.
