Smiths, and jewlers may from time to time ask you to imbued stones to make
Jewlery, or imbued armor, or weapons. They can also be used by potters to
make Idols, and such. Mostly for you. unless you are a smith, or maybe a
potter prob. won't use them, but they have a use. You may get an enchanter
or master smith asking for them some day.   :)
