OK Read the info on Eqdruids about quading, some mobs are quadable
some are not. It all has to do with how they behave in a pack and
obviously those mobs are not what I would call quadable. The Ice
Giants in Everfrost do the same way as the spiders you mentioned with
one wrinkle, they can TP back to spawn point when low on health. Talk
about a mess but it was only an experiment so what the heck.
Talk to the druids wizzie they do it more than anyone else.

BTW seeing someone quad without snare has got to be a hoot to watch.

Good Luck
