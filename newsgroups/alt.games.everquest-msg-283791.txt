That's what I did... I stopped healing for a bit in frustration.... lol... 
it didn't take long to see that Mr. Helpful Druid could not handle it alone.

I am the first to accept help when I am in a situation where I need the 
help... but this was not the case. I was very capable of being the main (and 
only) healer. The tank is my husband... You think I'm gonna let HIM die? 
haaaaaaaaaaa... Not on your life, mister! :)
