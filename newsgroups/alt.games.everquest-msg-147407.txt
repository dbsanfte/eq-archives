I don't agree with everything you say, but I can
see you are hurting a bit.

People have different ways of coping with grief
and loss. Don't pay too much attention to those
that disagree with you, it doesn't necessarily
mean they don't care. And, sometimes, people just
don't have the words to say exactly what they
mean.

I hope you get through this anniversary with the
least amount of heartache possible.

Good luck.
