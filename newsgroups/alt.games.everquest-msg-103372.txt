* i guess just a little hint to newbie players*

It does become annoying when a newbie player (who doesnt know any better)
starts begging. A simple ask is ok (i guess) but hounding you and asking for
reasons why they cant be twinked does irritate you! (I know you can /ignore
but this is an example after all)

One of the best ways to 'play' is to simply chat to people (in character)
and ask for impartial advice, more often than not a player will help you if
they can, or more to the point if they want to, to simply help foster the
team spirit that appears a little buried nowadays!

Yesterday i asked a character if my Lv16 ranger would get slapped in the
cauldron, we started chatting and he lead me to un-rest. Normally solo this
place would nail me, but he buffed me up and kept an eye on my hp, in 15mins
i had hit 17!
the point is i never once asked/begged for help, and my intention wasn't to
try and be sly to get buffed, he just helped me out.
this has happened now on a number of occasions and its a nice change to be
helped without having to lower ones self!

To conclude i then went back to Kelethin and a newbie Lv1 came up and asked
me for money!!! I said no, then he started to ask normal newbie questions, i
answered these as best i could then helped him out with fletching supplies
and my elmrecurve bow (Got better anyways). He was stoked and learned some
stuff to help him through the game without having to reply on buffs/twinks
because hes not used to fending for himself!


I'll be suprised if anyone read this far! But just thought i would voice my
opinion, if its right or wrong, oh well, life goes on! Just help it makes
newbie players think a little more thats all.

Remember we have all been there!
