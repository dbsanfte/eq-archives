Quick question on the topic of dying armor: EQTraders' lists the
following as the "main ingredient" for black dye:

>Charcoal, blue slumber fungus, green goblin skin, froglok skin

Now, is that "either or", or do you need ALL of those items? If it's
all of them, then it's the only color that requires more than one main
ingredient...
