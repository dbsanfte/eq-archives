Many people have the belief that monks where far too powerfull at one time.
I never ranked them as more than middle of the pack though, and that was in
their heyday. Pre kunark monks where actually prety good since no one had
decent weapons monks did about 180% the dammage of a warrior. Kunark came
out and monks died. Then things just got stupid, the monk mitigation nerf
affected a class destroying about 30% of that classes value when that class
was already vying for least usefull.

Good pulling requires feign death (raid pulling does not use lull as a
rule ). Snare, mez, and high sun are also very usefull. Necroes do just fine
at raid pulling, so do sks, so do bards. All 3 of those can peel mobs of a
kiter better than a monk can.

Dps is a critical function. Monks are actually good dps providers and this
is the major source of monk love. They are not as good as rogues, or
rangers, or weezards, or beastlords , or magicians . On the bright side for
monks , people really just dont know how bad they really are so they tend to
get groups anyway, and there is not really all that many of them so who
cares anyway :p
