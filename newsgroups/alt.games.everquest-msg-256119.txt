Now that I'm 65 my guild is really pushing me to get my epic.  I *know* its a
nice cleric item ok?  That said:
I don't want to sit around camping green spawns for the rest of my life.  I
simply do NOT care about my epic enough to do it.  I never have.  Period the
end.
I told my guild that i've never even started my epic.  So, my guildies have
taken to camping this crappy stuff *for me*.   So they've got me feeling guilty
so *I'm* starting to camp this crappy stuff.  It's dull and I don't want to do
it anymore AND IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.
I've tried telling them over and over again that I really don't GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT THE DAMN THING but they continue to camp LB and shards and pushing the
importance of doing this and how much I'll love it.  Yada Yada Yada.
I don't have patience for this kind of crap.  
I think this is one of those *indebtedness* things.  I'm starting to feel like
I *owe* them for their time, (and I'd rather owe them a bunch of plat, that can
be repayed) and I don't much care for it, especially since it's something I
don't care enough to work for myself.
FWIW, we already have clerics in my guild that have their epic.
So here's my question:  Is this really such a big deal to a guild?  Do *uber*
guilds have a requirement that clerics have their epic?  Is refusal to complete
Epic a firing offense?
