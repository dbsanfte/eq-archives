This weekend, I logged on after several days without playing and was promply
contacted by 'someone' (yes, I know the name, but will not give it here)
from the guild.  He wanted me to join in a raid the was about to start.  I
declined, since I was in Lower Guk at the time and wanted to stay there, but
turned on Guild chat to see how things were going.

I was suprised to see this 'someone' bad mouthing me to the guild.  I asked,
on guild chat, why 'he couldn't stand me'.

10 seconds later, I was removed from the guild.

No big deal, there are many other guilds, but since he obviously was a guild
officer and removed me so I couldn't see what he said about me or respond to
it, I thought I would mention the incident here.
