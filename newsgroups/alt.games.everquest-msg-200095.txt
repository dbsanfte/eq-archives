You are almost certain to find a Brewing geerlok in Shadowhaven on the gnome
vendor behind Trade Commisioner Henry. Otherwise, you'll have to buy one in the
Bazaar or find a Tinkerer to make one.

Mostly; there are no geerloks for Poisonmaking, Pottery or Fishing.

>4. and do they return after each combine regardless of success?

They go in the Primary slot. Don't forget to remove them before going into
