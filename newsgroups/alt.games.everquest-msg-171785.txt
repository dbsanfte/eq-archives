Hmm.  I actually look down on a cleric with the Exarch title unless he has a
good 150+ aa.  It means he has preferred appearance over reality.

The reason is that, the cleric class aa rewards are worthless compared to the
archtype and planar aa rewards, which are substantial.  Any cleric who has spent
more than 9 points for MGB in his class aa has made his character less effective
simply to have a title, unless he has a shitload of aa, enough to engage in
frivolities like DA and 100% rez (once every 36 hours!).

Using aa you can get huge increases in WIS, HP, channeling, fizzle lessening and
specialty checking,damage avoidance and mitigation, and some useful tricks like
Divine Arbitration.  Even a much better Divine Intervention.

If you see an Exarch, he is either 1) an uber dedicated player with a powerful
character and massive aa,  or 2) a shallow pride-ridden hack who has spent his
first 42 aa points (actually more like 50) simply to have a better name, wasting
aa that would have made him a more effective cleric.
