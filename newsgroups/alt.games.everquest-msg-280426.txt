Ha,I saw that statement coming.  =)

Well,there are always some breaks,caused by people going afk,
replacing group members,dieing pullers =),etc,etc.
Its very,very rare that a group is killing for hours without the
smallest break.
And in most groups are other classes which can heal,I have given
up on arguing with Druids that there mana is much better invested
in nuking than in healing.They seem to think its their job to keep
everyone at 100% health all the time.
Knights can heal themselves very well too,often the 600 hp/tic HoT
is enough on them in one fight in MPG,not to speak of lower level
content,where I besides throwing a Divine Arbitration every 3 minutes
mutate to a full time dps class.

Sure,was talking about meleeing on move not on target. =)

Yes,sometimes I play Pally too in Ldons with lower level folks,a Pally
who can pacify everything,and thats the point why I started playing
a Cleric originally and retired my at that time 54 Pally.
