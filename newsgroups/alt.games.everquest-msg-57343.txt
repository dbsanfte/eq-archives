Aye  - Have your human ride the boat to BB, and camp out near the rings.

Then simply get your iksar a port to BB. (BB safest - no NPC druids or
guards, just a couple of skellys at the rings) Just be patient enough to
wait for someone that can port to show up in Cabilis, FoB or LoIO.

Oh - and leave that shroud in the bank until you're at least 6th level. If
you try the exchange before then and something goes wrong, the CR would be
so long the corpse would decay long before you got back to it.
