> 1) Will the bazaar ease pressure on the EC tunnel?


On my server, trade place are NFP, not EC tunnel, but NFP had 30 people 
or so in it earlier, so its already desolated. Only people trading there 
will be the ones without Luclin.


> 2) Will it seriously and/or adversely affect pricing
> of items?


Yes, this WILL affect pricing. At the moment on my server, i see loads 
of people undercutting me, but i choose to ignora it at this time, since 
i hope those people are just clearing out bank space.
If prices dont stabilize within a few weeks, the prices on my server 
will suffer a 25%-75% hit.
Of course this is not all bad, been picking up some nice gear for my 
warrior for 1/10 of the normal price. And for spells, well, as soon as i 
get back in again (stupid longin server), im gonna get all spells my 
druid dont already have. Got 4 cheap spells so far + POTG (200pp=), 
Improved Superiour Camo(250pp), and Nature Walkers Behest (500pp, for a 
friend), which i should be able to sell a lot higher when the prices 
stabilize, or sell to guildies who need.
