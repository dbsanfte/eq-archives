I've been considering a barb shaman myself.  Good to hear you liked it.  I
fretted over the night-blindness, but Shammys get serpent sight at 9 to
counter that (pretty nice solution).

I keep meaning to start one, but having too much fun with my SK.  I'll wait
until hell levels, then I'll probably do it.
