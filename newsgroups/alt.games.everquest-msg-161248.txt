All,
I have been through all the everquest tech nonsense with no result,
after they told me they don't support laptops, which I think is a load
of crap.  If you purchase a laptop with the minimum requirements, I
think they should support you.  Anyway, everything was running great
on my laptop until the Planes of Power patches came out.  Ever since,
directly after server selection, I get booted out of EQ with windows
telling me the eqgame.exe had problems and had to close.  I own a
Toshiba Satellite 5005-S504 with a GeForce2Go and a DirectSound
compatable sound card.  Everything adds up that it should work, but no
love.  Any ideas??  Anyone else running EQ on a laptop after the PoP
release?

Thanks,
Eric
