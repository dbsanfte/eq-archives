Umm... no real violation of the EULA? Have you read it, or just click
ok when its in your face. Quote:

"8. We and our suppliers shall retain all rights, title and interest,
including, without limitation, ownership of all intellectual property
rights relating to or residing in the CD-ROM, the Software and the
Game, all copies thereof, and all game character data in connection
therewith. You acknowledge and agree that you have not and will not
acquire or obtain any intellectual property or other rights, including
any right of exploitation, of any kind in or to the CD-ROM, the
Software or the Game, including, without limitation, in any
character(s), item(s), coin(s) or other material or property, and that
all such property, material and items are exclusively owned by us.
"

with the last line being key.

And YES, it IS law:

"16. This Agreement is governed in all respects by the laws of the
State of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered
into and to be performed entirely within California between California
residents. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
of Goods is expressly disclaimed. Both parties submit to personal
jurisdiction in California and further agree that any cause of action
relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the County of San
Diego, State of California (if under State law) or the Southern
District of California (if under federal law). If any provision of
this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision
shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Our
failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not
waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights
hereunder, and any attempt to the contrary is void. This Agreement
sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between us and you
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided herein,
this Agreement may not be amended except in a writing signed by both
parties. "

This may be only a game, but there ARE laws against what he is doing
and SOE could introduce legal action against this person. Basically
this last bit says that if you violate the EULA, they can persue legal
action based on California law even if you dont live in California (by
agreeing with the EULA you are allowing them to do this). Yantis is
making a buck off of SOE's intellictual property, and thats illeagal.

I suggest you read the EULA next time you play and if you dont like
it, decline the EULA (and hence dont play), its your right to decline
it, but thier legal right to enforce it if you accept thier terms of
service.
