Absolutely. It's also true, though, that they idea of martyrdom appears to 
be more central to Islam than to most other religions these days (not that 
they invented it, of course, or that it's a religious act only... think of 
the Kamikaze pilots in WW2).

Now, as for "excuse for their actions"... If we were talking about a bunch 
of drug dealers thinly maskerading as a liberation movement in order to 
terrorize the peasants and rack in the cash, then the word "excuse" would be 
very appropriate, but we're talking about people who blow *themselves* up in 
these acts... I think that the religious side of their acts cannot be simply 
dismissed as an excuse.
