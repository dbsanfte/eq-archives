You forgot N.

Tribunal, shaman and barbarian can all also be just plain N so that
is also one the shaman can be though maybe his chart did not show
that..

Barbarian
(N/NG/ON - OG/DG/DN)

Shaman
(ANY)

Tribunal
(ON- OG - N)

= ON, OG or N As shaman barb choice. 

but not DG.... oh I see now you put "DG" and then said you can't be
"DG" so I think you meant to put "N".
