Try pressing TAB while booting, or hunt through the BIOS for an option 
to turn off the boot logo screen. This will allow you to determine 
exactly where its hanging.

Also try looking for an option which allows you to specify which bus to 
look for the VGA card at boot. You should have an option to set it to 
either PCI or AGP. Choose PCI.

The option to turn off the onboard VGA should be under "PCI peripherals" 
or something similar from memory... If its definately not there try 
updating your BIOS if you are comfortable with doing that.
