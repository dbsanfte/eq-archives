Count me in. ;)

That sounds feasible. Though I'm still kicking around the idea of a 
item_combine_trivial < level * 5 policy for buying crafted items.

This is exactly how I would hope to see it work. Also, I would never 
charge a guildmate to do a simple combine, or several, for them.

Again, sounds right. No fee.

Honestly, I've also kicked around the idea of discouraging Bazaar 
selling as well as buying. We will likely be amassing plenty of coin in 
the course of our adventuring. Is there a reason for skilling up in a 
tradeskill faster than that money supply can provide? Wouldn't there 
come a point where you would be making gear that is level-inappropriate 
for lower level characters? I would question the need to put such a huge 
effort into skilling up.

If absolutely no one can use it, roll on it and sell it on a vendor. As 
I've said before, the money will be there when you need it down the 
road. It doesn't have to be turned into something right now. I don't see 
any reason to be opportunistic about it. If you need the drop from 
Najena, get some people and go hunt in Najena. This is another mentality 
that will take some getting used to. It will also be tested for 
adjustment over time.

If the items are appropriate for you, then I don't see why not.

That's not what has been suggested at all. We would be quite concerned 
with helping each other in their own efforts.

In a giddy sort of way, I hope. :P

Again, why would you be putting so much effort into your trade? Let it 
improve as you adventure. Perhaps this isn't the best place for people 
who are so ambitious where tradeskills are concerned. :/

Assuming his group mates are all of similar level, why not? That's what 
it's for, right? Same with KEI and others.

I hope I've answered that adequately.

Sure. The ones that do not artificially develop a character by providing 
them a loophole through which they can obtain items that a character of 
their level should not be able to acquire on their own.

(item_combine_trivial < level * 5) is sounding better and beter...
