Thing is, BST pets don't push worse than mage or necro pets, and those
pets don't push any worse than a warrior. There are a couple of BST
warder proc buffs that have knockback, though. If the BST is using
those on his warder, then you need to smack him over the head. Other
than that, most heavy melee classes can actually out-push warders
easily.
