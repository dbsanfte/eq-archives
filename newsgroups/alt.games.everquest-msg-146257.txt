No.

'intelligent life' would have seriously thought through these changes BEFORE
patching - which the fucknobs at Verant evidently did not.

As usual, they tried a little sneaky and got bit on the ass.  I only wonder
exactly how bad subscriptions fell during the last 48-72 hours that prompted
the high and mighty EQLive crew to rethink this bullshit.

Say, isn't that fuck Abashi still working for VI?  because this latest round
of changes stinks of his fatass tampering...
