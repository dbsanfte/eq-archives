Normally, I make it a practice not to provide my spell donations until after
I've received the spell. The obvious exception to this is when receiving
Wizard TL's, though obvioisly I could wait until the "do you want to go"
message came up.

Well, I also generally like to take a trusting attitude within reason, so,
last night when someone responded to an /ooc in Jagged Pine where I was
looking to donate for greater wolf form, I toss her the 20pp she had asked
right after she verified it was the 49 lvl spell (lasts much longer). Now
this was not only stupid from the normal sense, but extra so sense we hadn't
even grouped yet (which you must for any shared wolfie). But, hey, like I
said, I'm generally trusting within reason and it was only 20pp. Then comes
the "sec", followed by "Arelila fades away".  I begin to wonder, but think
she may have just invised - should have done a /report right there. Of
course, she gated. She was anon - no surprise for a druid. The odd thing is
that I couldn't get /guildstatus to work on her - just kept saying she had
to be "a living character or supply the name". Odd stuff.

In any case, the plat is no biggie. The fact that we continue to have peeps
running around like this is, however, a problem, so I have every intention
of letting the world know and letting nature take it's course (I find this
group is historically very helpful with cheats).

If you're on Povar, send her a /tell for me - the name is Arelia. Beware of
trades with her, and I would suggest not accepting her port services either.
I can't personally attest to seeing this, but 3 or 4 peeps told me last
night when I was publicizing the theft that she was also dropping port
people in dangerous zones and stuff. Very strange. I have my suspicions as
to what might be going on here, but the bottom line is:

1. Don't do business or otherwise put your trust in the Povar tune named
"Arelia"
2. If you feel like it, pester her with tells for me telling her it's not
nice to cheat folks and to find SingSang and give him his money back and
offer additional atonement of his chosing (This would likely be a donation
of an additional 20plat to a newb I'll pick at the time - if she does it,
I'll post it).

Be well all....
