Hey, that's what I did - farmed fangs for a few hours.  It figures - I
finally got in on the ground floor of an exploit and kaboom, it's going to
essentially get rolled back.  I can't complain, I knew the snake fang value

be much more afraid if I traded in legit items - maybe this revaluation
program will work perfectly, but I wouldn't bet on it.
