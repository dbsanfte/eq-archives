I seriously doubt that I am even close to being alone in disagreeing
with that blanket statement.  It is rare that I can sit down to play
and be fairly well assured of not being interrupted, so I have made
a point of learning where I can park a character in many different
zones.  This was especially important before they changed NORENT to
give you 30 minutes before it poofed.

Only if (1) your STA is under 100, and (2) you are barely looking up
enough to stay afloat before your stamina bar goes down.

The way EQ handles swimming skill is stupid.  And anybody who takes a
few minutes to figure out the game mechanics (and I mean less than 5
minutes total to work it all out) will quickly realize that he can sit
at the tube bored silly, or catch up on household chores, or take a
nap, or read a book, or go play catch with his kids, or even go out
for a beer, while maxing the skill with zero risk to his character
(assuming it's not a PK server) and zero inconvenience to any other
player.  There are no macros, no extraneous programs, no cheats of
any sort.  People have been doing this as long as the game has been
out with nary a whisper of protest from any GM.
