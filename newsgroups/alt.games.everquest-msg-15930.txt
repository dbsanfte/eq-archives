My suggestion would be to PL her up two or three levels.  How to do this
mich be difficult for you to do.  I would suggest going and finding some
nice undead, posibly going back to Nejena.  You pull and kill it down 1/4 of
it's life.  Then stop attacking and have your cleric friend KS you with Ward
Undead series.  You will need to continually taunt, and she will need to not
over cast while you stay on the top of the hate list.  This will get her
closer to your level and make going to Iceclad a lot easier.  Also I might
suggest going to Eastern Wastes and hunting near the bridge.  There are a
lot of spawns there and I received good EXP there.  If the guild is really
wanting a high rez capable cleric, I also suggest getting a high levle druid
to go along and DS the cleric and let the cleric go into a battle a bit and
have the druid heal, DS and divine arua are a great way to PL a cleric
against fast hitting mobs.  In Nejena with the EXP bonus, blues and evens
should level her pretty fast with less danger than useing red mobs.
