LOIO used to be a great place to do 20-30, heck, even 2-30 although hard
to get to for the low levels that didn't happen to be born Iksar.

Its still a good place, with interesting mobs, some outdoor some "indoor"
(but with Outdoor spells being castable)... but while it once had a fairly
high ZEM, as a "newbie" zone due to being part of the Iksar newbie areas,
yet with mobs up to respectable levels, it seems they hit that with a
massive nerf stick, its now listed as one of the lowest ZEM's in the game,
lower even than the normal baseline.

Go there if you don't care about getting exp at any real speed.  Learn
tactics, try things out.  Sadly you won't have a lot of luck finding a
group, the zone now has an average of three people in it, while it once
sported over a hundred at a time... Even more if someone happens to be
doing their epic, I think the most I saw at any one time was 150.

Paladul Caverns is the current king of exp for the low 20s, great really
from about 5 on, but there are other great places for the teens, Paladul
keeps going for several levels after Kurns et al peter out.   Once you hit
25 or so you'll have to move on, and there's really not anywhere fantastic
to go that I know of, everything will feel like a slow grind compared to
the rocket assisted leveling in PC.  I like to hit Marus Seru just because
its different from PC and doesn't suck.  Dawnshroud is popular but far too
laggy on my machine.  Eastern Wastes has Walrus you might be able to take,
or Iceclad has cougars and giants and dervishes and wolves, then there's
Crystal Caverns, Aviaks in SK, Gnolls in SK... lots of places really, none
stand out.

Oh, I've had a lot of fun killing DE guards on the bridge in Nektulous,
which is both satisfying and profitable, as every single one of them drops
a bronze longsword good for 3pp to a vendor.  Not tons of exp, but after
leveling up in PC you might need a cash infusion.
