"One"?  "*ONE*"?!?!  Al Queda alone has attacked and killed U.S.
Citizens repeatedly, to say nothing of other terror organizations.  I
suppose it's not surprising you haven't heard about it, we didn't make
too big a deal over it, but when they start killing thousands of our
citizens at a pop, we gotta say "enough is enough."

Well, OK, since you asked.  Here's a few to start off with.  Look at the
attack on the Cole or the bombings in Tanzania and Kenya.

"One...attack"... pft.

Mind boggling.  Just mind boggling.
