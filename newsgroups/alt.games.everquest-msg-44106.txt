>>>SNIP BABBLING<<<

>> Er... Smed? Smed? You wanna try and explain this to us in a way that us
silly shits can understand? <<

Well, I'm not Smed, but I'll try to explain something that, according to
everything you just posted, boils down to you asking me to waste my time.
But, for everyone else who will read this, here goes:

Those are actually two separate points. Customer service has nothing to do
with the making of the game. That's what Mr Flock is talking about, the
creation of the game. And his comments fall under this little phrase:

If you try to please everybody, you'll end up pleasing nobody.

Think about what a mess EQ would be if they did do market research..........

"A Troll? Who would want to play a troll?"
"We should be able to buy all armor from a vender, isn't that what smiths
are for?"
"Every class should be able to port. Just make special ports for non
casters."
"You should be able to able to pick the facial features you want, right down
to the colors of your eyes."
"Why put ports into the game? Make everyone walk, and use boats to connect
continents."
"d00d pvp roxxors"
"We should be able to worship any god we want."
"If I kill my opponent, he should lose xp. If I die, I shouldn't lose any
xp."

Those are just a few (possibly bad) examples off the top of my head, but
gives you a general idea.

In closing, let me say this. I've been playing RPGs for close to 25 years.
I've played paper, electronic, MUDs, all different games, all different
kinds of people. I even ran an e-wrestling league site for a year or so.

                                                          "Gamers don't know
what they want"

This may be sad, but it's definitely true.
