Some friends and I were camping the Ancient Cyclops in Ocean of Tears.

There was a necro there already.  We agreed that he'd get the first ring
that dropped and we'd take over the camp afterward, so we all grouped up.

After a couple of hours, we noticed that he hadn't moved in a while.  He
didn't respond to tells, and seemed oblivious.  No big deal, we could hold
the spawn.

But then the AC pops.  We kill it, and try to get him to wake up.  Nothing. 
We roll on the ring, loot it, and keep fighting.  Eventually, we get tired
and decide to leave.  But what to do with this guy?

We /petitioned, and the guide that showed up booted him off.

The next day, I get a /tell from the guy along the lines of "What happened?"
He'd pretty much slept the entire night in front of his computer and woke up
at the character select screen.
