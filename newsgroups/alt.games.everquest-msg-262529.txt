WHoa there Nellie; back that up a little.

Guy makes 100k, has NO DEDUCTIONS (or do you mean he makes 150K but his 
deductions turn it into a reported 100K?).

Now as has already been demonstrated he really  pays 21.55% of that 100K 
plus 7.75% for SS, fine.  He has 78.45K remaning. Assuming he spends it 
All on taxable goods at your astounding 12% (in PA, AZ, MA, and TX, all 
areas I spend weeks or months each year, the amount is very close to 
6%... dunno where this 8-12 figure you are getting comes from) then he 
pays 12% of 78.45K, or  9.414% of that 100K figure, NOT 12% of it. 
Taking your assumptions at face value thats still at most  30.964%.

But he's probably going to have a number of deductions (mortage 
payments, medical bills, etc) so lets assume his taxable income is 
closer to 75K. Thats the 28% bracket, and works out to 13.5K using your 
chart.  Of course he's still on the hook for the whole 7.75k SS tax, 
oddly enough.  Then he's going to spend a sizable chunk of his income on 
food and clothing and services, which in most states means no sales tax. 
  And my experience suggests that he's likely looking at 6% sales tax on 
the items he -is- paying on.  Say he's still a spendthrift who blows 
half his pay on taxable items, saving nothing at all; 50K (I'm assuming 
his real pay, not his adjusted income, just to be crazy generous to you) 
at 6% is 3k.  He's looking at 13.5K plus 7.75K plus 3K, or 24.25K, which 
is 24.25% of his pay, a far cry from your 50% figure.

Mind you, this guy we are talking about has no savings and spends crazy 
amounts of his income on taxable goods, and he's still clocking in at 
less than half what you thought.  State and property taxes will add a 
bit to that, but they are in most cases the smallest slice of the tax 
pie, coming in well after the ones you actually tried to grapple with.

Tell you what, how about for one year, we charge him what you said we 
would.  Use that money to pay off the national debt; coincedentally this 
is how much it would take to do that (on average each american owes 
$25,000, so I'm assuming he's the average american to make this work) 
Now, no more deficit spending, and we could cut another $2500 per year 
off his taxes cause he wouldn't constantly be working to pay the Vig for us.

Then again, maybe the whole national debt thing gets a bad rap; I don't 
know who we are borrowing from, after all.  Some of it is in bond 
issues, which are often bought by american citizens; perhaps they 
benefit more from the bonds than they pay in debt service (although that 
seems to be in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics, 
getting more out than you put in and all).  Perhaps some of it is going 
to poor countries, and working like a form of foreign aid.  Perhaps some 
of it is going to countries which might be hostile to us, but are afraid 
to actually do anything for fear it would cut off the interest payments.

I doubt it though, I bet most of it is lining the pockets of people who 
are already nominally our friends and already actually rich.
