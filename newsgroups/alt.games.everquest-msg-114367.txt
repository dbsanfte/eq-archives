Typo?  Like when a co-worker was putting together a report of everything
done in the evening shift and sends it to some VERY HIGH upper management
people who look over it to make sure things were all done and done
correctly.
They luckily proof-read things first, because it would have been correct
spelling and probably correct grammar (but I doubt they run that check
anyway).
They title the document "Nightly Shift Report" but this time almost left out
the "f".
Some of us wanted them to send it anyway as an honest typo, but they didn't
think that high of management has a sense of humor like the rest of us.
