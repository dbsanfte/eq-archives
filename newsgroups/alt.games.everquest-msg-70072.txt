Actually, I do.  As a child growing up in a remote western state, I
was entranced by books about NYC, even though the newspapers were
printing that it was bankrupt and filthy and overrun by crime.
Everything about it seemed like exactly where I needed to be.  Many
years later, after having visited a dozen foreign countries and
numerous other major cities I finally found myself in NYC.  It was
everything I had ever hoped and more.  The really great part is that
I'm only a quick walk across Central Park from the Guggenheim Museum.
They have Picasso's Lobster and Cat in their permanent collection.
