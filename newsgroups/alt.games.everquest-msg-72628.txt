*Sigh* lol Bill the nuke i speak of is Force Shock. Not a good nuke for
level 20 really.  But like i said i never had a need to use it.  I leveled
with purely AEs. 4 Blue/even/yellow gobbos at level 20 is incredible exp :)
From what i have read everyone complains about it.  It's good that it didnt
hamper you in any way though, maybe everyone has over-exagerated its
un-usefulness, i would have to start another wizard to find out :)
