[snip long serious question]

I grappled with this for a while. Eventually, I quit raiding and then
quit EQ. I investigated a few guilds on other servers , made idle
inquiries with Meem about the UK server, and looked at Drinals open
raids but really... at the end of the day I found I no longer enjoyed
the people I played EQ with, and there was no 'tie' to a new server
to keep me playing. 

First, I quit my raid guild and dropped to a smaller guild I'd hung
around with for a while, hoping to regain the magic of my original
family guild days. Eventually, I realised I didnt know these folks
very well, although they were all nice enough, and that the people
I ended up grouping with were the raid level players who'd known
me in the elemental planes slaying gods, etc... and the assholes I'd
quit to avoid.

One day, I logged out, hit delete, watched the screen while it timed
out and then cancelled my accounts. I still miss EQ, really, but I miss
what EQ was when I enjoyed it, not what it became.

So... Advice wise? Sit and think about why you play EQ. What it is you
still enjoy about EQ. And try to maximise that... if theres nothing but
nostalgic memories, try something else for a while and see if you
enjoy that more. You can always return.
