Depends entirly on how they do it.

If you still need to put the same effort to go from one to sixty then
(IMOSHO) it is a good thing. I.e. if they spread the amount of effort
that level 30 takes between levels 11 through 30 then that is OK, if all
they do is put a bonus on xp earned in level 30 that makes it seem like
a normal level then that is bad.

The problem is that the easy way to "remove" hell levels is simply to
add a bonus to any xp earned in that level. Also note that this is how
they removed Hybrid penalties.

They could still use this solution to spread the effort over other
levels, by putting a negitive bonus on "non hell" levels. 

E.g. at the moment level 35 is about 2.2 times as hard as level 34.

So apply these modifiers to xp earned in the following levels :

31	0.82
32	0.82
33	0.82
34	0.82
35	1.72

The total number of kills to go from 31 to 36 is still the same, but now
each level takes about as long as the previous level.

There is still one problem with this, "pain" levels. Since the xp loss
by death is calculated on the total xp needed for the *previous* level
this system would make levels 31, 36, 41 etc. double pain. Not only
would you loose twice as much xp as normal (cause level 30, 35 etc.
still take the same amount of xp) but you would also have to kill more
MOBs to get it back (0.8 multiplier on xp)

So they would need to tinker with the xp loss from death too.

I seriously doubt that VI have considered this.

However at the moment the Hell levels are gone comment seems to come
from one random poster on the safehouse with no data to back it up.

HTH,

Jim
