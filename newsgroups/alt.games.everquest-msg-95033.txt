Plot: Me soloing a wyvern near druid ring, wizard Momolewiz from
the X'Agon guild pulls his snared quad pull right over my pet,
two from his pull aggro my pet, one leaves after two strikes, the
second wyvern decides to stay and beat on my pet.
My pull is near dead, so I wait for my pet to finish it and as the add
is beating my pet badly, I fear the (already snared) add and start
fighting it, not without sending the wizard a /ttell IDIOT
Reply I get is along the lines "What do you want? You KS my pull
and call me idiot?"
Next I know is the guy runs straight past me again, and gates out
with me between his pull and himself.
Pull aggroes my pet again, I can fear them off but pet gets killed
and I am OOM and thus unable to finish the first mob that was
trained on me - I end up having to run and med up far away.

Conclusion: Momolewiz from X'Agon is a jerk!
Point: None, but I feel better now...
