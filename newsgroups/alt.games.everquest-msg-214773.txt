So far I've 2-boxed the *cleric* for every adventure I've done, and only
lost once.  Of course on that loss the cleric *and* the enchanter were
2-boxed, though it was a collection adventure and we seemed to just have
terrible luck on drops after the wipe.

So I'm gonna have to go ahead and disagree with you.  I'm by no means the
best 2-boxer and I can 2-box a cleric in the adventures just fine while
being the puller, and even tank occasionally.

Everything else I agree with heartily.  LDoN has some nice mob models,
simple but well designed dungeon layouts, good access, etc.  It's a great
expansion for someone who plays a lot but never got into hardcore raiding,
a demographic I think the game largely ignored until now.
