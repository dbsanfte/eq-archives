Verant were very generous with that nerf. Drops off a 50th level mob in a
45+ zone, I think Twinks with this weapon go off lightly.

Grotesque Alloy Mask, drops off of Lord Picklaw in Runnyeye, you're not
gonna solo him.
AC7 7dex 2gil and - lotsa Cha :�)

> Shoulder: Tattered Mantle
Not much around that would give you AC to match and Dex. Grtr Guard of Haste
is AC10 +5 Dex/Agi/Str and 11% haste but rare as rocking horse shit.
Engraved Pauldrons from KD AC12 5agil 3dex and a crap load of minus in Cha.
Neither of these you could solo.

Lizardscale Cloak AC8 +5dex from templer in Feerott

> Legs: Ac5 Dex5 Cha5
Try and get Rygorr here, you are a little low to hunt the orcs in EW yet but
not far away.

Waist? Spiderfur belt, to low (again) to hunt for but easily bought. AC10 +5
Dex/Agil +40hp

Those rings you have, there is a +7 Velium variety now.
Looking further on rings,
Sparkling Scale ring (drops in Scarlet Desert no idea what off) AC4 +6agil
+6dex +15hp
Everyone will tell you to wear the +6ac +65hp rings..but I won't coz it'd
make me a hypocrit..I would, however take the dex/str over dex/agi.

Can't help with quests but I would add this, Take AC over stat anytime.
Everyone will tell you are wasting your time with the Dex craving and I'd
agree with them BUT do what you want with your character just don't
sacrifice huge chunks of AC for Dex, example your face slot and leg slot

Thanks for showing that Bracer you have, never even knew it existed, will be
off to WL shortly :�)
