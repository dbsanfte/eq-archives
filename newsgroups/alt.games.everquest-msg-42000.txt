Ok Everybody. I have a really stupid newbie question.

I see in groups and everywhere where people have hotkeys assigned to things
inc pulling whatever and such. I know how to bind a hotkey such as sit camp
run or whatever.
My question is how do I bind a hotkey to a macro like a saying or phrase or
something that a key doesnt already exist.

thanks for any help
