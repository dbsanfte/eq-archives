Guilty as charged, though I don't think most people who actually talk
to me in game would immediately lump me as a generic one. I'm not a
thee and thouing roleplayer, I freely admit it. But I do believe I am
a roleplayer in other ways. Heck I even had two stints on Firiona Vie,
and might still be there if I hadn't gotten tired of EQ at one point
and stopped playing those characters.

>what you know is how to powergame, not "play a druid"

You are welcome to that opinion. I'm 110% confident in my abilities as
a druid, however, in group and out.

What I am even more accurately than a powergamer, is a wargamer. So
what I want is not to level the fastest, per se, but to maximize
efficiency. This is why I hate bad groups, why I question people doing
giants for experience, etc. in a group it means I want to be pulling
as fast as possible with as little downtime as possible (my main
before the druid was a warrior and I was damn tootin the best exp
puller on the server. Couldn't finesse too well, but damn I kept the
mobs coming good). Its not wrong, its not that I only focus on
killing, I am talkative in group and guild too (yes, even shout
sometimes). But nothing irks me more than the puller standing there
not pulling. I don't like sitting around in groups. I tolerate it
soloing only if I am quadding or deliberately after something.

Sue me if you think thats wrong. In game (and it IS a game, so I don't
really care what anyone thinks) it means I'm good at what I like to do
best - get experience. I hate farming items, the idea of camping rare
spawns turns my stomach, I have no interest in tradeskills. I want to
*fight* and I want to keep fighting. I'm good at raids, too, but I get
frustrated at the buildup time and impatient with those who can't seem
to get their shit together in a timely fashion.


>, and "when to
>group" is with a bunch of high level players whose ass you've been
>kissing in order to level you up as fast as humanly possible.

When I leveled to 60 there were virtually no one higher than me. Those
that were around the same level had the same ideas I did about getting
experience as efficiently as possible. 

In other words they were *good* at EQ. They weren't prone to those
group mistakes you were talking about.

So no, I didn't kiss any ass.


> I'm

I knnow its impossible to convince anyone, because I can't prove it
here. I am quite convinced myself, though. No false humility. I know I
am good at being a druid, and thats quite okay to me if you don't
believe it. I will still give advice on what to do here as a druid as
I see posts that seem to be asking it.


>Am I close?. Not that there's anything wrong with it, not in the
>least. More power to you. 

You got many things right, a few things wrong, of which the only
really important one was the ass kissing bit. No one leveled me up, I
leveled myself up, period, full stop. Sometimes it was in a group, but
I was as much a contributing member of that group as anyone could be.
