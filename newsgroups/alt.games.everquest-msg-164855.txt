"Reality"?  What reality is that?  The reality that only a small
fraction of 50+ Warriors have Windblade or better?  Or perhaps
the reality that the most Monks have a far better weapons available
to them than other melees pretty much throughout their careers?
Or perhaps the reality that you're whining and moaning without
half the itemization of PoP planes being known yet?  Or maybe we
should eliminate the reality of a droppable MNK/BST 2hb that out-
damages Windblade, from PoP, being for sale in the bazaar already?
