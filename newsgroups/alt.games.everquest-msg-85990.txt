Hmmm, I see two possibilities:  either Maesyn (sp?) likes half-elves
better than he likes humans, or when I did it with my human I didn't
even bother to check until I had raised my faction.

I still enjoy battling the CB orcs, probably because my first few
characters all did quite a bit of it.  I learned the user interface
playing in GFay and CB, lots of firsts there:  first lost corpse,
first time a character survived falling into water (for some reason
I could not figure out how to swim the first few weeks I played,
guess it was too easy), first development of a tradeskill (fletching),
first death due to hitting a guard with a bowshot when the mob ran
behind it, first time being poisoned (heh, panic attack!), ...
