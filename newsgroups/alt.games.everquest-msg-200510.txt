I see it every day. The game in the lower levels has become a freaking 
mechanical process. There is far less enjoyment in it what with everyone 
just rushing through it. Even if you take time to enjoy it, those people 
you group with today are going to be PL'd 10 levels past you in a couple 
days' time. There is no community in that. There is just you dealing with 
and endless stream of anonymous characters.

There was a time when it wasn't that way. It was a better time. The game 
was savored and enjoyed and the levels came as they may. Getting to the 
higher levels actually meant something.

Except now all those problems still exist *in addition* to the new KEI 
and Temp addicts. It's getting worse, not just different.

I don't know what boards *you've* been frequenting then. It happens all 
the time here. I read from pro and con alike, often in debate with one 
another.

Just like the opposing view will always use the "nerf whiners" idea as 
rhetorical support for their own opinions.
