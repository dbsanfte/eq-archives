Ironically, I zone so slow it's not funny. I often find myself cornered
by a bunch of naked gimps on a zoneline, but then, theres nothing I can
do about it so I just pull the plug if I can't outzone them.

There are no faction hits unless you kill a char in their home city.

Also, quite a lot of those level 5 pk's were actually blue server
players who are bored and run around killing newbies for kicks. It's
kinda obvious when you see a level 5 warrior running around called
"Fenninroisdown" killing people in gfay.

There is no justification needed for any combat. Remember that.

I agree. The problem of delevelled level 5 pk's could be passed by
levelling in a non-peak hour time, I have done that with every char I
have made.

Who knows, most are probably sitting on Fennin Ro or somesuch killing
dain for the 25th time.

But I feel everyone needs killing :p

Invis/camo makes you invisible to everyone except those with see-invis
up. And I don't think I know a pk who doesn't keep it up all the time.

It is PvP. I don't deliberatly search for people in vulnerable
situations, I just deliberatly search for *people to kill*. Anyone in
range.

Not really.

Perhaps if you knew how to level on a PvP server you would know me :p
