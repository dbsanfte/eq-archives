> Aggemammon Airport <Everwatch> level 30 Woodelf Druid (Free porting)

This Free Porting thing of yours will disappear VERY soon. You just got your
port spells last level, so you are enamored with the power of it and you
enjoy helping others, I understand that.

However, just a few requests like I've gotten recently will certainly shut
you down quick. How about... you are fighting in KC, and you get a tell from
someone asking for a port from NK to Gfay. I say no, and his reply is "I'll
pay you 20p". what a bonehead. Now nevermind that the nexus can do that for
you.... why would someone ask a 55th druid that is in a dungeon to port them
from/to ANYWHERE? and I mention the 55th part because a 30th druid may have
been happy to do that for 20p, 20p still means something to the 30th, it's
not diddly to a 55th.
