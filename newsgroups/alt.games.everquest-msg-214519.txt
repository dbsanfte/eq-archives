I've succeeded once, failed 2 times.

I agree.

Also a collection quest, we had SK, Monk, High Level Mage, Chanter(me),
cleric, and rogue.

Yes.

> If you have even one wipe, you are screwed.

No.  We finished our collection quest with probably 35 minutes to
spare, but with the high level mage we were able to really push
through mobs in an almost chain pulling fashion.  I do think that
a wipe would really make it tight on completion though.

It seems there is a best path each time, and only on the killing
adventure can you just go wherever.  (Maybe on the collection
one too)

Yes, but even going back isn't necessarily a good thing!

We had a rogue, but he couldn't disarm (or couldn't figure out how
to disarm) the trap.  Got nailed with a 500 pt dot at level 56.  Whole
group wiped.  We also got hit with a trap on another box that made
it like we were full on drunk(maxed).  That sucked worse than dying.

Bring a chanter, no substitute for crowd control & pacify. (and clarity)

Pacify is NEEDED!  There are many times where a large group
of mobs will be in the same spot.  Pacify does a great job of
allowing you to only pull one.   FD pull does take too long.

Yeah.  Defiantly.

Evac is your friend.  If you have a Evac'er with you then have them
cast if you get over run (right away).  Its easy to run back to the
spot you were (and you *might* but unlikely run into a wandering
mob) since there are no respawns.  This will save your mana
and time. I'm not sure its worth zoning over a few dying... tough call.

/agreed

I'm not sure I've noticed one way or another.  It does seem that the
first few rooms are pretty easy, after that I haven't noticed a big change.

Especially if you have a good group.

Yeah, if the Wis caster has the room, this could save many
lives.

At 56 my splits were 50 pp split & 170 pp split, an augmentation (I've
seen 2 drop) no items.  (no loot from chests or barrels)

So far we have rezed the dead, so only the cleric needed to really
bind right next door.  But I'd defiantly recommend the cleric bind
just outside.

> Any one have any other good tips?

Keep moving when possible.  Try not to sit around and admire
the scenery too much.  You don't have to fly, but you can't be
slow.

And they take a long time to get started if you want to complete it as a
success.

So far they are fun, and its a great place to find a bunch of near level
blue mobs.  Just need to refine my tactics a bit.
