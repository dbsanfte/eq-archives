Unfortuanately this doesn't surprise me, it happens all the time, the trade
side of EQ is full of holes that many High level players do not realise as
they spend all their time playing the game and not trading.

To start with, why was "fast drop" on? By default you can not drop an item
without a confirmation box appearing.
The main way to lose bags is to put them in a trade window with other items.
Items return (or move) to inventory slots before containers so all the
spaces get taken and containers drop. DO NOT TRADE WITH BAGS! people still
do and still cry about losing their items...
Your friend was running so I can only assume he either had Fast drop on
(WHY?) or tried to put the bag in to auto equip slot with no spare slots.

Bizbee, as always, was a little harsh but the fault lays with your friend.
The guy that sold the equipment is prick for doing so but you'll find many
people will act that way, greed rules EC I'm afraid and that bag dropped in
the worst place possible.

If I had picked up the bag, you're friend would still have it. If the bag
had contained something like an RBB or a Fungi Tunic...I wouldn't like to
say.

When I used to carry items that I considered expensive (basically I couldn't
afford to replace them) but I was trying to sell I used to put a bandit sash
(no drop item) in the backpack, this was before the confirm drop was
introduced, as I had lost items already by dropping them (and not realising)
or putting them into no rent containers, couple of screw ups like that makes
you cautious.

CF
Given the choice I'd rather we lost the person that sold all your friends
items, rather than return them, than your friend. If he has quit because he
decided that there are too many people like that on EQ, sorry, he'll find
that anywhere he goes on the net.
