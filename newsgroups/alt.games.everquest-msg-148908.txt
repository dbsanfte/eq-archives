True, but if you've got bottled metabolism lying around, when one kicks 
out, you just take another, right?

Of course eventually, the men women try and attract with thin figures 
are all going to be dead...

But then, imho women have come to depend too much on 'having a man' to 
begin with, so it's a win-win situation.

That'd be nice.  I've got the self esteem and confidence, but it'd be 
nice to get rid of the bitterness I dealt with while *finding* said 
things.
