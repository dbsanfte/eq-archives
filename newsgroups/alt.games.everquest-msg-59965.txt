Actually, I was in Velks because my freaking twink got sorta stuck
there.  Never got around to taxing his ass out of that idiot filled
zone.

Just when I would get sick of it and decide it's time to leave, I log
in and find 15 people in the zone and suddenly the exp grind is very
solid.  

That is why my twink was parked there for so long.  

As for glossing over difficulties, what difficulties exactly?
The worst that can possibly happen is a total wipe out.  Even at major
raids, if you get completely wiped out, it's about 45 mins to 1 hour
downtime max.  Most of that time is spent running non-casters to the
zone in question for SC and rez.

For exp grind groups, zones like Velks is a joke.  You have a port in
in the next zone and also a bindable city as well.  That means you die
and at worst, it's a 5 minute run to get your corpse summoned.  Keep a
coffin in the bank and you can get your body summoned pretty damn
easily.

Whatever challenge there was in this game pretty much went out the
window a LONG time ago.  These days you have a completely detailed map
of practically every zone, spawn locations, loads and even how rare
the drops are for the most part.  

There was a time when if you died in LGuk, you ran a VERY real risk of
not getting back to your corpse for several hours, or even days.
Those days are long gone.

These days even zones like Fear/Hate where total wipe outs are
probably as common as it was before, isn't too serious as Fear/Hate is
so heavily farmed.

You're trying to describe "dangers and difficulties" to people who
when they first went on a Naggy/Vox raid, they would delevel from 50
to 47 (yes, totally delevel as it, no way you're getting a rez on a
corpse stuck under Naggy's left testicle) and run a REAL risk of
losing all their equipment.  These days deaths in this game is so
painless it's laughable.  

When was the last time you saw someone over level 40 who died and lost
all his equipment because his corpse rotted?
