Ok, first off I'd have to say that unless you and your 3 friends will be in
constant contact verbally or in person, you would be wise to choose all 4
classes from the same race for comminication reasons. (the rp server doesn't
start you with common languages and limits the rate at which you can learn
them from others)

My personal selection with that in mind would be
1. DE warrior  - tankage
2. DE cleric - hp buffs, low level melee/tankage, heals (later on rez is
good to have handy)
3. DE Magician - pet for tankage/dmg, damage shields, nukes, summoned focus
items, general summons (coh is good to have when group members get lost at
later levels)
4. DE Enchanter - croud control, best hastes in game, 2nd best slows, some
nukes, tash, clarity line, limited pets/charms, ILLUSIONS ;p
