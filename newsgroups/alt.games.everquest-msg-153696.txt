Spend a little cash on some twinkage.  Get a pair of Velium Fire Opal rings,
and a pair of Electrum Black Sapphire earrings.  That's +200 HP.

Don't worry about heals.  Just wade into a gnoll camp and start fighting. 
You'll kill 3 or 4 of them before they take you down.  You reappear at bind
with all your stuff, at full health, ready to go again.
