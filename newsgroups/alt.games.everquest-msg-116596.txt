Sure I can.

Randoming is unfair.

There, said it. :-)

And, it's true. Because it doesn't reward those who put in the most
effort. See: druid numbers in hate vs druid numbers in fear for a
famous example. It was common to see every single druid in guild in
Fear while maybe one or two on Hate raids (in early day EQ). According
to you they should still be randoming for drops as if they are equal.

I say they're not.

Over those who would use it? Darn right I can. They can get plat
anywhere. Items people can use should go to those who will use, not
those who will sell. If no one can use and its a valuable item it gets
sold for guild bank cash to supply clerics, enchanters, and necros.

As far as I am concerned it is the most fair. Those who deserve an
item the most get the item. Eventually everyone benefits. This doesn't
mean the same person, the one with the most seniority, is the only one
to loot things until he is stacked out; others are still given top end
loot as it comes.

It is neither the most fair system nor is it fair at all, except in a
socialist sort of way.
