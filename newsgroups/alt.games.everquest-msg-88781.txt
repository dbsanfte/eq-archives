I'm still trying to put this stuff together.  I've got all the Mistmoore
Granite I need.  I've got six Sands of Ro, and four Melatites (after three
hours in Sol, only one drop).  For the molds, I have the Kijin plans, a
nightfall giant's head, and the two kettles from the Mistmoore Cooks.  I've
got a guild enchanter for the plat bars.  Now, I'm down to needing to finish
my Ronium bars.  The only thing I still need for those is the fairy dust for
the Soil of the Underfoot.  Is there anyone on the Raithe who has Fairy dust
(or the soil), and would be willing to sell it to me?

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
