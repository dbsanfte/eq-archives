The spot that comes to mind is Tower of Frozen shadow, there are some
"traps". which if you stand on, will attack you like a mob would, except
that you can't target or hit it back.  Step off of it to stop getting hit.
Using sense traps, you can find a "trap" and then using disarm traps, you
can make it inactive for a few seconds.  IMO it's a waste of a skill.
