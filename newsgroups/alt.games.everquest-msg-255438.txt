Because it would totally alter the game from the ground up.

None of that changes the fact that you'd have nothing *new* to do. Sure, 
you'd be able to look different, but that gets old. PvP *is* coming and 
that may help, but, I don't know that the CoH player base is really a 
hardcore PvP type, I could be wrong though.

All the things you mention, in my opinion, doesn't really do much to 
solve the problem that *I* have with the game.
