Something similar happened to me once.  We were fighting in BB under the
bridge when I died.  I zoned back in after the run from Qeynos to find my
corpse just inside the zone.  I had consented one of my friends much earlier
in the evening for a previous corpse run, so I figured it must have stuck. I
started to loot my corpse and did a group say thanking him for dragging my
body back to the zone.  His, and the groups, reaction was one of confusion.
Not only had he not move my corpse, they were standing guard over it waiting
for me to show up.  When I was done looting, both corpses disappeared.  It has
never happened since.
