Sad but true, most dungeons when they do have people seem only to be
there for Quest items, once they get what they want they are gone.

I have played my rogue through 52 Lvl and I have never ever been
acused of PPing a mob in group. But That doesn't mean I haven't.
The only time I PP in group is if there is a Ninja looter or if its
alway the same asshole in a free for all thats getting the loot, split
on or not thats Bullshit. But you have to remember to PLAY your rogue,
after all you are a thief. Like I said i do PP in jerk groups and the
only reason i don't leave the group is to practice my skills on a
deserving group of chumps.

Rule 1 ) Don't pick the mob clean : If you get 2 to 5 plat or Gold on
your first PP stop, Don't be greedy, remember more mobs are coming.

Rule 2 ) Chose your mob wisely : If you are fighting  mobs of
different types don't bother with the ones that you know are poor ,
that way when ninja looter loots unpicked mob, it's the same amount
he's gotten before, so in his mind you are NOT pp the mobs.

By the way Ninja looters and loot whores are the first ones to say
that you are pp. FACT, think about it.

Rule 3 ) Look like your fighting : OK you know you can't PP while
fighting so time your PP so that it looks like you aren't just
standing there . This is what I do, 

Fight starts, I get behind mob hit PP the BS then melee, then if I
feel like PP while in fight, i wait till BS button is ready then
unclick melee hit BS fast so it 'LOOKS" like im still in fight, then
PP then melee back on. Looks like i never stopped fighting.

Good Luck
