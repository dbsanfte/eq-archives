1.1 What is this patch?
This is a driver for Windows. It is intended to stabilize computers that
have VIA chipsets.

1.2 Why do I need this patch? Do I need it at all?
If your computer has any VIA chipset made between 1997 and 2001, and if your
computer has any of the following problems, then you might need this driver.

  a.. Files copied from one IDE hard disk drive to another are corrupted
  b.. The computer stops ("freezes", "hangs", "locks up"), or makes unusual
noises when playing sounds, especially to a Creative-brand sound card
  c.. The computer stops, or files are corrupted, when copying to or from an
IDE DVD, CDROM, or CDRW drive
  d.. Sounds played by the computer are distorted or have a "crackling"
noise, especially sounds from a Creative-brand or Aureal-brand sound card
  e.. The computer stops when playing 3D graphics or games, especially on an
ATI Radeon series video card
If you have none of these problems, then you do not need this patch.
