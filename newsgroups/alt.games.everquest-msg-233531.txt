1st: where are you hunting that you get THAT many adds?  Your
group should set off away from the spawn point if possible... Then have
your tank pull to you..... This will usually reduce adds.
2nd: it sounds as if your necro needed to control his pet better. I play an
enchanter, and have been told by groups not to even BRING a pet, since
I cannot call it off.
Now to the meat of my advice, as a cleric, your job in a group is to keep
every player alive.... I wouldn't waste mana on healing a pet, since the
necro can (theoretically at least) summon another.... Mana should be used
to keep the group together. If a pet dies, it gets summoned right there. If
a player dies, unless you are hunting next to their bind point (an extremely
dangerous and foolish idea, BTW) he/she will take time away from the
group on a death. When you are overwhelmed by adds, having your tank
2 zones away is NOT the best idea.
My advice, invite an enchanter to the group... the crowd control on adds
is right up his ally. If you cannot find one, have the ranger Lull (is that
in
his spell level? dont know. never played a ranger) Root is NOT a good
crowd control spell. It is too random and leaves agro on the group.
