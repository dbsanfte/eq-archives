I tape The West Wing, Enterprise (for now), JAG, Law & Order, King of Queens
and Friends and I was them during the weekends.

If I'm watching TV "live" it's more often than not The History Channel,
'cause no matter how boring the topic sounds they do a good job covering it.
Just ask me about the history of concrete! <g>  Well, if it's Monday night I
stare at Jill Hennesy for an hour on whatever show she's in.
