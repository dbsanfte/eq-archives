	ahaahhaa...no.

	B5 was pitched to Paramount years before it went into production by WB.
When it was announced, Paramount suddenly announced DS9 and rushed it into
production before the B5 series could get on the air.  DS9 copied liberally
from B5 all through its run, going as far as to hijack an actor from B5 to
play basically the same character on DS9.

	DS9 was easily the best Trek of recent years, lightyears better than
Voyager or Enterprise...but then, it had better source material to draw from.
