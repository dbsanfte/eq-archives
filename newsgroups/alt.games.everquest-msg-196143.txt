After level 30 or so, bards have no hope of maintaining aggro. I regularly 
group with a SK that is 7 levels lower than me and I can never keep aggro 
(trying to raise defense) unless he purposefully gives it to me by FDing, 
etc. I have tried DoTing, etc. to no avail and this seems to be a common 
"issue" among all bards. One of the hardest things for a bard to do is to 
max Defense because we have low HP/AC and low Aggro compared to the real 
tank classes.
