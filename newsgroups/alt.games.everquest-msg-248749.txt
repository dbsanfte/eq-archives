Agreed. As I said in a subsequent message, there is no "need" to set up a
premium account. However, let me add another perspective. I like having a
resource like Allakhazam around, and I want them to continue being around
and providing the kind of content that they provide. Bandwidth costs money,
content costs both time and money, and ad-sponsorship may make ends meet but
I question whether it provides sufficient incentive to keep the quality of
content consistently high. If paying a small fee helps keep this resource
available to the community, then I really don't mind making that small
contribution. I realize that not everyone will share this perspective or
find themselves able to spend funds in this manner. But for those who can,
it's another good reason to consider doing so.
