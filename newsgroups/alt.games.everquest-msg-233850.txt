At 42 wins in Miraguls I talked to Teria Grinntl and she told me this:
"When Miragul started considering the end of his life, he fixed on not being
able to learn and see new magic and artifacts. He then turned his pursuit of
knowledge toward existential and planar concerns. He read accounts and
folklore around the planes of Power and Discord. Then, he found ways to
access those planes and created portals for them."

I'm wondering if this might point to more planar content in this or the next
expansion.
