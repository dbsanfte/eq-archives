Why are you so worried about it?

If people like that kind of game, it will sell, and they will try it in 
other games.

If on the other hand, people thing it's lame, it will not sell, and they 
won't try it in other games.

Either way, who gives a shit? It's not like other companies won't cater to 
the market of people who don't like it.
