<snip heartwarming story on the maturity of EQ players>

Welcome to Bristlebane, Wanaya =)  While I'm sure you'll meet some people who
may discourage you, and of course there's bad apples in every barrel, but
despite all that, there are many genuinely kind hearted people on every server.

As a rule, a good portion of people who play EQ live by the idea that you reap
what you sow (insert really bad druid joke here).
If you ever need a helping hand, ask around for Alianya or Nytalia.

And you may want to come to the PvP Event my guild hosts (to kill folks, win
fabulous prizes, and make some friends in the process) held in Rathe Arena on
January26th.. http://www.everquestraids.com for details =)
