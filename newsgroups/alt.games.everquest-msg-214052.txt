i don't mean to be one of those people who constantly undermine quests...=P

...but, you can buy a weapon with an equal damage/delay ratio, plus some
extra stat points....for 2 gold...

if you check out all the vendors in shadowhaven, i'm sure you can find a
*fist of wood*

anyway, if you really do want to do the quest.....

to the best of my knowledge, shar val is indifferent to outsiders, so you
should be able to do it

(i brought an iksar through shar val and all the guards were indiff....)

worth a try, if you're really hardpressed to do that quest
