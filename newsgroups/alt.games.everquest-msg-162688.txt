Sadly, the convention for the NG is that only requests abreviated to
CIHYS will be rewarded, but thanks for playing.

Second, hey, didn't suggest I was quitting, just that other people
might want to go 100% AA at 62.99999, or else concentrate harder on
getting flagged for PoV/HoH rather than diving full force into exp as
I did.

63 doesn't make me much worse than 62 did (well exp for AA is harder
to come by) it just doesn't make me much better either.
