And, more importantly, untested. The "brilliance" of the SWG team in 
action. They are also not going to beta test the majority of the planets 
externally because they want to keep some things "new" at launch. The 
other day they released a new planet to the external team and people 
found tons of bugs immediately after it had been tested internally, and 
yet they still have delusions that the other planets will work perfectly 
for launch. /boggle
