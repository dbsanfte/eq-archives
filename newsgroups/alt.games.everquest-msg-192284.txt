Now I just gotta ask these questions;

Why did it piss people off to see monks soloing in fungis at a time
where every halfassed caster is soloing with KEI??????????

Why was it anyones freakin biz what monks were doing? 

For that matter why should anyone care what ANY pure melee is doing
solo? They sure aint clearing the zone the way Crack headed casters
do.

And what the hell good did that nerf do? Did it help anyone? ANYONE? 

Nope it just took pleasure of the game from people because self
serving assholes decided monks shouldnt do that, whatever "that" was.
