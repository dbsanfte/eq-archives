Level 54 Wizard in Cobalt Scar.  I dont need SoW (have Jboots) and i never
hunted for clarity or had to hunt for my mobs, they are static spawns and
always within your field of vision.  4 blue conning Wyverns found, aggroed,
and killed within 1 minute.  It takes only 4 casts of Pillar of lightning to
kill them.  Each cast of pillar of lightning takes less than half a bubble
of mana.  Since you seem to think i would lie about a wizards soloing
ability (why the hell would i?) i point you in the direction of this
website: www.graffe.com Please feel free to check their forums, particularly
the section under AE kiting.  This is not something that is uncommon.
    Wizards have been Quad kiting since pre-Kunark, as have druids.  It is
also not something that takes a high degree of skill,  all it takes is a
little practice.  I quad kited this wizard from level 16 to lvl 55 so far.
While it was tougher at the lower levels, from 51 onward Wizards get new AE
spells with incredible damage/mana ratio's.
    It is quite clear to me that you are very uneducated on the wizard
class, which is nothing to be ashamed of.  If you would care to make a
character on Ayonae Ro server i will happliy bring you to a ground where i
can prove my statements to you.
    To be honest i am totally shocked people are even questioning a wizards
ability to do this.  Since 99% of 50+ people on my server are more than
aware of the wizards soloing ability.  Perhaps you havent been playing
Everquest long enough?  Also as a point of reference to you....in level 51
quad kiting wyverns i was getting approximately 1 yellow bubble of exp in 1
hour, As were the other 5 or 6 wizards and druids who were doing the same
thing at the same time.

As four your last comment about some wizards having low INT.  I find that
quite offensive, I wouldn't make judgements like that if i were you. You
have no idea what i do for a living, and you certainly have no idea how
intelligent i am.  While i wont pass the same judgement on you, chances are
the field of work i am in requires alot more intelligence than yours, if you
want me to list my qualifications i will (although i dont see what it has to
do with everquest, or soloing ability)

P.S. While typing this response i thought of a nother way i could back up my
claim.  I could take some screenshots of me doing a /time ingame just before
and just after quad kiting a set of Wyverns. Showing you how much mana i
have left, how long it took me to round them up and kill them, and also
showing you the 4 exp messages along with the 4 dead wyverns.  If you would
like me to do so please say, I would be more than willing.
