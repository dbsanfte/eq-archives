OK,

First of all, let me say I was victim of my own stupidity, but I'd like to
find a way to get back to someone who tricked me. I was minding my own monk
business when a Barbarian provoked me to a Duel. Being quite bored at the
moment I accepted, just to see how long it would take me to lose, and to get
some practice, knowing that I would probably lose against someone slightly
higher lev than me and very well armed. My condition was : no buffs, and the
duel *had* to stop before one contestant would die ( a bub to).

Of course, I eneded up being butchered despite my pathetic cries for the
b... to stop hitting me as I was loosing HP faster than an Orc at the
Freeport Western Gates, and died whimpering..

So, OK : I fell for some old trick. OK I was dumb and naive. But hell, I was
also trying to be a good sport and all I got was a lousy trip naked from
Freeport to NRO without a SOw, and a "fuck you" tell from my killer when I
asked if she had read my requests to stop beating me to a pulp.

Man, I want to get back to that bitch. It's petty, I know,  and I won't feel
like a better person (I already feel like an idiot)...Any machiavelian ideas
that doesn't involve duelling again ?

Mr NiX
