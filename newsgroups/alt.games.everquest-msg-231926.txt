So, level 5 is selling his pelts at 1pp each, level 20 is selling the 
same pelts at 5pp each, and level 65 is selling the same pelts at 50pp 
each.

What justifies the higher price is the fact that by farming the pelts, 
you are saving someone else the time he would have spent farming them.  
If you set your price below what the buyer can make in the time it takes 
to farm, then, he saves time, and you make a decent profit, both sides 
are happy.
