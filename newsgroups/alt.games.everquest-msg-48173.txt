Hi all,

I have to admit I am very disappointed.
I just created a character on Firiona Vie, excited to do some REAL
roleplaying, like I am used to from my good ole pen and paper sessions.
During the first 5 minutes after logging on I was just standing around,
listening to the shouts in the zone, and I had already heard enough to know
there won't be more roleplaying on this than on any other server.

"Is the soandso quest broken ?"
"When does blahblah respawn ?"
etc...

Thatï¿½s lame. I don't think many Halflings would know what the word "respawn"
means... What about
"Soandso is a lyar ! He promised me a reward for doing an errand, and what
did I get ? NOTHING ! Did this happen to anyone else ?"
or
"I wonder at what time blahblah will dare to show his ugly face again..."

I think a lot of people only see the possibility to start a new character on
a new server, where no one will be twinked, of significantly higher level,
and so on. This is sad. They could at least _try_ to roleplay a bit. No one
can be that uncreative... that's just ignorant.
When I was calmly stating my opinion online, all I got was a LOT of
"STFU"-tells, and maybe 3 out of 50 ppl in the zone at that time agreed. A
pity. A real "roleplaying only" server would beef up the game for a lot of
people I think.

Just my 2 copper pieces.
