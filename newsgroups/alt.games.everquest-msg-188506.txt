Another good way to make money, once you have a bit of cash, is to go
the Ruala in Innothule Swamp, near the entrance to Gukta, and see if
she has any spiderling silks for sale. If she doesn't, but her
inventory is full, buy out one of the items in the inventory
(preferably a cheap one that costs about 1 silver a piece), close the
vendor window, and then open it again, and see if the new last item is
spiderling silk. Repeat until you find spiderling silks or the last
slot is empty. Then you sell back the other worthless stuff you
bought.

Last time I did this I walked off with 35 stacks of spiderling silk
for about 1pp per stack, and that was three or four days after the
last patch, so she fills up quickly. That's quite a profit, whether
you sell them off directly or make leather paddings. Of course if
there are already people doing this on your server you won't get as
spectacular results, but you could get lucky.
