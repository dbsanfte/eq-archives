It seems to take a really long time to login. After I click "Play
Everquest" I end up staring at the logo screen for a minute maybe
more. After I pick the character I want to play, its probably another 30
seconds or so before I am in game.

I recently got a cable modem (Road Runner) and just started playing EQ
again. When I had a 56K modem it didn't take anywhere near this long to
get in game.

I checked the datarate setting and it was at 7.0 and I also tried
9.0... what would be the best setting for a cablemodem?

Thanks!
