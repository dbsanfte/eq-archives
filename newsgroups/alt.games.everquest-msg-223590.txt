When my friend got his SK epic, around the time that our local
uberguild was breaking Vex Thal for the first time, he was the ninth
on the server.

It seems like SOE has mucked with epic drop rates in Hate and Fear.
When we were doing Hate (about 2 years ago,) we were letting EoaV rot
because all of our enchanters and every enchanter we could call in to
loot already had it.

We never did see a SEoC, though.
