Just to clarify, there are many different types of dropped silks but the 2
most common are spiderling silk, and spider silk.

 2 spiderling silk make one silk thread (Used for leather padding and other
things).

 2 spider silk make one silk swatch (used in caster armor and other things)

Both are no-fail combines, and a good way to work up tailoring in the early
stages.
