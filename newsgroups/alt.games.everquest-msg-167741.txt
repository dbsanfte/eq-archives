I tried to deliver the froglok legs to The Gobbler in Neriak got nothing
from him. I'm an ogre Beastlord and he cons indifferent to me. How
should he con to me to complete the quest, what faction do I need raise
and how do I raise it? ...or is the quest broken?
Thank you for your time

Cheers Watchman :)
