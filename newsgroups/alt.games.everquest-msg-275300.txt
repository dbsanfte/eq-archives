I too have worked on my AT but as an Ogre shaman, is there any point in this 
skill apart from role play?

Oh, for all the well-versed and knowledgeable shamans out there - would you 
mind checking out
my shaman junk gear and recommend any upgrades? My guild is very small, (not 
elemental yet), but we pride ourselves on tight teamwork and dogged 
determination. I'm not afraid of long tedious quests.
Note: Magelo hates me it appears, as I can't seem to get my HP's and AC 
right, they are around 2600 and 1000 (unbuffed) respectively IIRC.

PS: One final thing hehe, I am tired of the unbalanced PvP and hate on Zek, 
so I am looking to take up the free server transfer. I live in New Zealand, 
which is on a different time-zone than the majority
of players, so I'm looking for a south pacific populated server (I heard The 
Rathe server has an Aussie guild, which sounds good) - any suggestions?

Thanks in advance!!
