Slow is not enough anymore, but it sure does help.  Far too many of the 
summoning mobs mitigate slow enough that it is insufficient to ensure 
survival.  Many mobs even fully slowed, I don't have a prayer of tanking, 
just have to hope I get root landed again before I run out of hp, if they 
are not summoning mobs.  Currently, when I bother to solo, I do so in 
Fire, near the tables, where I can survive a few rounds of being 
pummelled by a slowed mob, when I have Virtue/Conviction.  This is 
usually long enough for me to get a root off again, not always, as they 
hit fast enough slowed that I have to take one or two rounds while 
casting.
