Completely and totally incorrect. The exact opposite is actually true. My
druid is PL'ing a cleric alt, and through the course of the last 29 levels
shes always had maxxed Defense, offense, and 1hb skills. Every 5 levels or
so Ive taken time out to buy her a KEI, and then chain cast for an hour or
so. That has kept her casting skills, meditate, and channelling all pegged
for her level.

No, casters can be powerlevelled and suffer absolutely Zero bad side effects
in skills. As to the player playing the character.. Well thats a different
story. Fortunately though Ive had a lot of time playing a cleric  st low
levels ; )
