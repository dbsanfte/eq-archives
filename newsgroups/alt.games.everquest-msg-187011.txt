I'm twinking a 22 level pally and having only played casters was
looking for a little advice on weapons. He currently has a mith 2hr
and I picked up a runed ice blade last night 38 dmg 49 dly I think for
200pp but man is it slow.

Current armor dwarven plate with dwarven work boots, fbss. black pearl
vellum rings and crappy earrings.
