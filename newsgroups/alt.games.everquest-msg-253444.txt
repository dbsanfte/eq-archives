You can join a raid. We did that a few days ago to get my GL his
cleric epic stuff. My epic stuff (Shammy) is all NO DROP but not LORE
or MAGIC, so it does not fall under the TLC. The poor clerics have to
get 2 things that are likely to fall under the TLC, the Ring from SOL
A, and the Crown from Rathe Lake. So for 4 hours he and I camped the
spawn in SOL A as a raid. One actually dropped in about 20 minutes,
but went to another cleric we had with us. But even though it was LORE
and MAGIC, it was not TLCd out because we were in a raid. My GL didn't
get his until the next day. Then we found Begurgle up on one lucky
occasion on a pass through Rathe Lake, quickly formed up a 5 man raid
and got the crown.

This is something I have been wanting to ask. What gems sell better in
the Bazaar than they sell to the vendors? Any in particular that I
should be looking for, other than Diamonds and Blue Diamonds?
