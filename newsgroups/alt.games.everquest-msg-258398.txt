Or, he might be the CHP officer I asked the question of, who disagreed 
with you.  Of course, he may just have been pissed at me, because he 
thought I was drunk, despite the fact I hadn't had anything stronger than 
Mountain Dew for about 6 days.

Eventually it was determined that the 'alcohol' he insisted he could 
smell on me was actually propylene glycol, as I'd had an unhappy 
thermostat moment a couple hours previously.

So remember that, the next time you're planning to drive drunk.  Dip your 
fingers in the coolant overflow.  Just be prepared to explain about the 
molecular similarity of ethanol and propylene glycol in exquisite detail.
(Of course, the fact I could give a quick lecture on molecular structures 
and scent receptors was probably what really convinced him I was sober.  
Potentially crazy, perhaps.  But sober.)

Strangely enough, he pulled me over originally for an unsafe lane change.  
But I pretty much have to concur that it was an unsafe lane change, even 
if I do think it was rude of that guy not to let me into the right lane 
more cleanly, what with me signaling and my exit coming up and all.

But the law on that is, you can only change lanes if there's one car 
length of space per 10 mph in front of you and behind you.  So basically, 
it's hardly ever actually legal to change lanes.  But yes, I was being not 
entirely safe, because I was running about three hours late.  That happens 
when you have to stop and change a thermostat. :)  But Bill was still 
sitting there, waiting for us on the curb, fiddling with his palm pilot.  
Man, I wish I had his kind of patience.

Although, again, there's a spot where I've found the vehicle codes and the 
handbook differ, The handbook says you should allow two seconds of travel 
time, the vehicle codes say the thing about car length per 10mph.  The 
cops seem to consistently say the car length thing, traffic schools say 2 
seconds...  Like all cars are even the same length, sigh.

But back to what you said would happen, "by law".  Which law?  I've read 
the vehicle codes, they say "don't frelling run a red light", but include 
insufficient definitions to determine whether the case I described -is- 
actually running a red light or not.

It's really kind of ridiculous that I've spent as much time thinking about 
this as I have, seeing as I've yet to ever get a ticket for running a red 
light...  But the dang contradictory answers bother me!  Arrrgh!  One of 
these days, I'll pester a congressman about it or something.

Of course, I haven't picked up a new copy of the vehicle code in a decade 
now.  Maybe they've fixed it.  But somehow, I bet they think they have 
more important things to do.
