Im not saying you were an incompetent cleric pre-PoP, sure there was a
learning curve...

Afterall, how many people got exp versus mobs hitting for 500 on a regular

The good clerics adjusted to that as with any other change though, it was
the morons and stupid %^&*^(& who couldn't hack it, and cried/whined for a
change.

Imho anyway :)
