If there are any raids on those dragons, you could ask to join even if all
you is lifetap for a few hits, as I'm told the faction hits are major? Also,
I'm not up on dark elf illusion, but wouldn't that get you the min. faction
required to do a turn in of the sarnak braids? Admittedly you can't sneak
which makes it harder, but i recall some item which made you into DE until
you camped or zoned, and you might get to dubious in one sitting.
