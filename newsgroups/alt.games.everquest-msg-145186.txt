There's another type of Ranger appearing... the ones dishing out ungodly
amounts of bow damage... at last!

maxxed item haste
+ spell/bard haste
+ quiver haste
+ Trueshot Disc
+ Eagle Eye
+ Neverending Quiver
+ Primal Bow  (dmg 33, delay 35)
+ 1 exocet-like arrow (Faydark Champion  is 11 dmg, or for non-Tunare -
Condensed Arrows is 10 dmg)

result... bow is effectivly dmg 43 or 44, delay 15-16
and with 45 AA points dropped into Archery Mastery, people are critting for
incredible amounts every couple of seconds!! :oO
