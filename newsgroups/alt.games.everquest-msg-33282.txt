On exploring the qeynos catacombs I noticed spiderlings and large spiders.
Kinda scary to hunt down there though.

If you can make the trip to rivervale it's great tailoring country.  Wolves,
bears, spiderlings, and giant spiders.  A short trip to west commons or even
east commons will find cat pelts.
