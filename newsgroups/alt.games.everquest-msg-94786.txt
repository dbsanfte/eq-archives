    I've seen a marked rise in the following types of "don't give a shit"
players:

(1) People who have friends in the game already. These players seem to be
told "get to my level ASAP, and I'll get you in my guild so we can play
together!" As long as they don't accidentally screw with someone in the
target guild, their buddy can usually get them in - so why care about anyone
else on the way up? Oddly, this attitude helps them - being a loot whore
gets them the gear needed to fit in with the target guild, and not giving a
crap about anyone other than themselves minimizes downtime. On my server,
the example is a warrior, F, who was friends with one of the top guilds'
clerics in real life. Trained everything in sight - but got to high level
faster by not dying, and got his shot in the guild because he knew someone
who would vouch for him.

(2) The E-Bay Gambit. Players using the E-Bay gambit stop playing the main
with the tarnished rep, go play an alt up for a bit, then come back claiming
to be E-Bay'ed. So many players have been E-Bay'ed that a lot of folks don't
blink twice at the claim, and as long as the "new" player isn't a screw-up
the old rep is discarded. Be sure to also get a new EZBoard account if
you're going to do this, though - I've busted at least one moron on someone
else's guild board when they didn't switch accounts. On my server, the
example is J, the paladin - he's been E-Bay'ed several times, apparently.
Yet when I partnered with him for XP once, he knew EVERYTHING the original J
knew about the old time players on the server, and even made statements
like, "It's been a long time since I've been uber."

(3) "Time heals all wounds". The main with the tarnished rep is put on hold
for a few months while other characters are played up. Then, the main with
the tarnished rep trolls guild message boards, looking for a guild with
nobody in it he directly screwed over. That becomes the target guild to try
and enter. There's so many people out there, and such a turnover rate of
high-level players, that it usually works. Again, as long as the player
isn't a screw-up the new guild is unlikely to turf them based on what
someone else says happened months ago. On my server, the example is M, the
cleric - he used to have a rep so bad that (during the Kunark era) NOBODY
would group with him unless their play day would end otherwise. And I do
mean NOBODY. I'd get tells from three zones away "need cleric," and upon
arriving find that M was in zone, LFG'ing for the past two hours. But he
stopped playing for a while (or, I suspect, played alts based on his
continued EZBoard activity), then came back when Velious was starting up and
joined a guild well-known for having high turnover. Nobody in that guild had
ever heard of him, so they had no reason to believe he was trouble - and you
aren't going to turn away a cleric just because a rival guild says he's bad
news, right?

    Or you'd best be in a guild that is self-sufficient. Back during Kunark
and early Velious, two of the top guilds were infamous for getting to a zone
second and bringing the GMs with them to force a roll on the contested spawn
that they wanted. They didn't care, because they grouped within the guild
and didn't need others for anything. And there's always a steady stream of
recruits who'll join any guild that can get them the best gear in game, in
case folks burn out and leave....
