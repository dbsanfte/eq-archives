	It would be interesting watching a 16 Wizard try to quad-kite, seeing as
how they don't get a snare until level 29.

	Which is practically every non-dungeon outdoor zone in the game.  I can
only think of a handful lacking animals...the Grey, Beholder's, Highpass if
you consider that a hunting area (I don't), Firiona Vie, Swamp of No Players
(sic), maybe Warsliks (I hate that zone, spent very little time there)...I'm
drawing a blank after that.  Oh, Tenebrous.  It has animals but you probably
don't want to try to fearkite them.

	I would daresay that Rangers have a much longer list of viable solo
hunting areas.

	OH, lest I forget: I soloed to level 48 before the EP penalty was lifted,
and to level 51 before the class received Panic Animal.  I soloed in places
like Unrest, Cazic and the Kedge entrance.  Tricky, to be sure (which is why I
did it), but a Ranger coming up today would have an easier time of it with far
better weapons and armor than I had at those levels.

|soloing power comes from quad kiting)

	It's no feat at all.  No one is denying that casters can bring down bigger
single targets than anyone who has to deal their damage at arms' length.  The
question is who is going to enjoy it more?  If you play a Ranger solo, you get
to be the lone hunter tracking his prey across the wilderness, with nothing
between you and a messy death but your own skills.  If you play a Wizard, you
get to stand at a shooting gallery and plink ducks.
