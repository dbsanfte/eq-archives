Why is he a moron just because he wanted to sell HIS Griffon Meat for less
than you would have done so?
I actually make a point of selling my items in bazaar for less than everyone
else and I dont mean 100pp or so diff I mean a lot less.  Unless it is
something small like spider silk or such but a WMBS sells for about 8-10k on
my server, I would sell it for 5-6k.  Its those greedy plat seekers that
make this game so hard to get upgrades to gear because they all want WAY too
much plat for certain items.
