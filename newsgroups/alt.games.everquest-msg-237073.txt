No need to wait . Almost all mobs are single pullable anyway. Monk phantom
works about 80% of the time and can feign problems. Its not like hard ldons
where 80% of phantoms are resisted. Also a good bit of the dungeon you can
invis past(though this of course adds risk if you are carefull can do
dungeon in 30 mins)
