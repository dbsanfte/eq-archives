You can start some of them (with friends) in your early to mid twenties
for the smaller pieces. Getting the evil eyes in Beholders and the Aviak
in SK wont' be all that tough and the drops aren't that rare. Some will
take you considerably longer. The talon for the breastplate drops in the
ballroom deep inside Mistmoore. That's a bear of a raid to pull off for
a low/mid level guild. Hell, you can lose high level players in there
easy enough.
