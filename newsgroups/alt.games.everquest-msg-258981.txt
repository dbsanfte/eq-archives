Its really the same site.  For a while, way back at the beginning, geocities
used to charge you $5 a month to make it use your 'nick' as a direct
link.  I'm guessing now that Yahoo took it over they just threw it in the
mix.

So the short answer is they go to the same place, one is just as good as
the next, just depends on the size of the link you want to use.
