Whats your point?

The two are not mutually exclusive.   The game *was* massively overwcrowded
during every prime time.

A level 1 could walk the halls of Sol B and Lower Guk and never have a
moments fear, because there were groups sitting on practicly every spawn
point, just waiting for something to spawn.    Back then those were the
about only two dungeons that would realisticly get you to level 50.

I wasn't playing during the time when it was Kunark + Old World only, but I
don't think that would be much better with those populations.
