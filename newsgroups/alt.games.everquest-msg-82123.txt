I have seen this happen several times (on a normal machine with no KVM). 
  When you are actually watching the screen as it happens it's just a 
bit of lag as you approach sister island, then poof, you are there. 
It's a quick change of location with no warning, like what happens when 
you end up under the world or something like that.  It seems to happen 
as the boat turns while it's approaching sister island.
