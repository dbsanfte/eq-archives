It's your ISP.

Sorry to spout the usual VI catch-all for everything, but in this case
it's true. I play from London (UK) on BT ADSL. I have a very stable
connection, better than most people geographically closer. So much so,
that I'm often main tank on agro-management ubermob raids (CT, Yelinak
etc) because I rarely LD or lag heavily, even on 50+ person raids. It's
not even because I have a great PC (I have a pretty average Athlon 800,
256mb, GeForce1 etc), it's just that despite the distance, I have a
clean line

Your connection problems are entirely down to your connection and have
nothing at all to do with your physical distance from the servers.

ps: I'm on Zeb too
