For that matter there is absolutely *no* MMOG made yet that has not had
*some* downtime outside of normal maintenence (excluding MUDs, MUSHs, etc).
On the upside, watching the complaining and stressing over not being able
to play a game (SOE OWES ME MY 42 CENTS FOR TODAY!!!!) are quite comical. I
hope they *never* develop one that never goes down. I'd miss reading those
threads!
