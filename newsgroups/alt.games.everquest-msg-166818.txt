I'm not playing a game at all here.  Just an observation that the
creation of the Firiona Vie server gave people like these ammunition
in this discussion.

And I do think they believe they're justified.

For someone who so easily dismisses my perception, you sure don't seem
to have any hesitation when it comes to drawing your own conclusions
on the causes of their behavior.

I'm making an observation.

Speculation.  And I'm sure they do care if their protests are valid,
because otherwise they wouldn't be coming up with excuses for why it's
an appropriate name.

They'd just tell you to shut the fuck up.  Not to say that they don't
do this now, but they wouldn't go any further than that.  Why would
they think they have to if they don't care?

Irrelevant.  Ask SOE what they mean by attaching "roleplayer
preferred" on their server it if matters.  It doesn't, though.

I'm not engaging in anything.  I just pointed out the most common
reason why people say the naming convention exists, that it helps
maintain the roleplaying environment.

Why do you presume I care about justifying it to anyone?  What I care
about is what SOE did to their server environments and what some
people think is appropriate behavior when they implemented their
"roleplaying" server.  And I said I don't think it had a positive
effect on the other servers.  This is one way this negative effect
manifested itself.

Again with the justifications....

I think when it's made clear why a rule's in place, it'll be more
respected by the population at large.  Hell, when I first read a
poorly worded paraphrase of the naming policies on the official site
way back in 1999, I thought it was bullshit myself.  (They were
exceptionally vague on what constitutes a roleplay-appropriate,
nonfriviolous name)  When I got a clearer idea of what was appropriate
and what wasn't appropriate, I respected it, because it wasn't
arbitrary, because I understood _why_ it existed.

I think having your player population respect your rules is an
important thing.  I think the FV server changed the tone of a lot of
their rules, and adversely affected the amount of respect the players
gave them.
