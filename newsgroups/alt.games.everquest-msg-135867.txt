IMO eating the chocolate, or dancing (or consciously standing rather than
dancing)  would be behaviors.  Behaviors are actions.  Liking or hating are
emotions.  Emotions are not actions; therefore emotions are not behaviors.
Emotions cannot be controlled, they simply happen. Our actions or behaviors
based on those emotions can be controlled. For example, I passionately hate
broccoli; however I understand that it is very good for my health, and DS
loves it so I make broccoli with dinner 2-3 times weekly.  Hating broccoli
is part of who I am.  An emotion that I experience.  An attribute that I
have.  Eating the broccoli is a behavior in which I engage.

Yes, if you were gay while alive you would still be gay while dead.  You
would no longer be engaging in intercourse with someone of the same gender,
but you would still be gay.  It is my understand that being gay or straight
is not based on the action of whom you engage in intercourse with.  It is my
understanding that being gay is based on the desire for and pleasure engaged
in intercourse with someone of the same gender.  As I have already stated
above,  IMO emotions and feelings are not behaviors. Therefore being gay is
not a behavior, but is a part of whom an individual is.

No, there is no core wiring within our central nervous system to pull our
hand away when we meet someone whom we do not like.  Pulling your hand away
from someone you do not like is a concious act (although, like many concious
acts the thought process happen very very quickly).  An individual is also
very capable of shaking one's hand with any person which one encounters,
regardless of one's personal feelings concering the other person -- just
look at politicians for proof of this.

Again, we have a basic different in what the difference is between a
behavior and an attribute, as well as whether being gay is a behavior or an
attribute.  If you read through my clarifications above, I believe that you
will see that the behavior (aka actions) I referred to above follow through
quite solidly within my reasoning.
