You can go to http://www.eqtraders.com and find the durations, but
from personal experience I have made Frost Giant Steaks (STR4 STA1
Banquet) and one stack of them will last 24 hours of RL time played..
Sold a customer of mine 29 stacks of them one time I think it was.
His warrior is gonna take forever to eat them LOL.
