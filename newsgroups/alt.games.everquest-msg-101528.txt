Assuming you want a Regular Rules server you can wonder all you want but
it's been well over a year since one was opened.

But assuming there will be one in SOME point in the future, there's no such
thing as fresh servers now that you can move characters for $50 (max $150).
Imagine...you and 10 of your closest friends pay to have your level 50+
characters moved...ahhhh...a month or so of farming SolA, SolB, UGuk, LGuk
with no competition!  Well, ok, LOTS of people would bring their 10 closest
friends, but still, competition would be seriously light.
