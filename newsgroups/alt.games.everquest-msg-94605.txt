I've never spent much time hunting in Karnor's Castle.  I'd heard too
many horror stories about trains. A few VS/VSR raids didn't really
give me the KC experience.

Recently I've been hanging out in the basement in KC. And I have to
admit: KC is special. Every ten minutes or so you hear "TRAIN TO
ZONE!!" and the inevitable "TRAIN LEFT!!" -- "GODDAMN IT TRAIN
LEFT!!!".  I've never quite experienced anything like it.

Only once was I actually caught up in a train. Someone ran to the zone
with 6 drolvargs on his tail. Standing at the intersection was a level
60 shadow knight and a level 60 druid, both with epics and ToV armor.
I almost felt sorry for the drolvargs. I root-parked a couple of the
mobs while the SK tore into the rest. He had a 45 pt DS (32 from me, 8
from ring 8 and 5 from somewhere else). With lifetaps plus Inny's
Curse plus a fungi plus regrowth plus a couple aa pts in regen, he
heals pretty quick. We polished off the train in a couple of mins
tops.

Sadly, as of last night I no longer have to hunt in KC. After days of
trying, Verdix Kylox's Remains finally spawned to give me my last
medallion piece. At long last I have the VP key. :-)
