You can just walk up the slanted poles that support the tents, you will go 
through the canvas. That's how people get on the wooden planks in the back of 
trader stalls as well. I'm not sure how you can get trader mode on top of the 
tent though, when I tried it warned that I must be inside a trader stall. I do, 
however, manage to set up shop on the wooden beam between the canvas tops. I 
can't do it right at the front of the beam though, I must move back just a 
couple of steps to be considered "inside the stall".
