Actually, if you told them you were dead and they believed it, they have
bigger problems then having been lied to.  The dead, in general, not being a
very talkative group.

*shrug*  When I was playing my female rogue, I followed a "don't ask, don't
tell" policy myself.  I never pretended to be a RL female, nor did I see the
need to correct everyone who got the wrong impression.  I just let them
believe as they would like.

Perhaps I'm reading it wrong, but it sounds very much like you're saying
that because someone could possibly get the wrong idea about my RL gender,
I'm a "sick fuck" for creating the character as a female.   Which sounds
pretty nuts to me.

And making a sock puppet to proclaim your death is a pretty sick thing to
do, no matter what gender the character was.

You didn't make a distinction in your post.
