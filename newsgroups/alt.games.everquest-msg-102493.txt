Yeah, that'd be a good idea for them too, if she didn't get motion
sickness when playing first person perspective games. Some people
do, and there doesn't seem to be any way to counter it. So EQ is
Right Out for her, sadly.

Hmm, how much did you muck about with computers? Enough to get a
job with them, maybe? Couldn't hurt to apply for a couple jobs
in IT too, if you wouldn't mind doing that for a living, at least.

Ouch. Of course, the trend these days is SMS chatting. You've seen
the SMS chats on various channels, I suppose? I bet there are some
pretty damn high cell phone bills in our fair country these days.

Maybe I'll do that. It's not a well-known trademark, possibly,
since the lead GM approved it on the spot, so it might not be
interesting enough to disclose in any case.

The only explanation I can find is that there were no guides on, so
it got auto-approved. No sane guide would let that go through unless
they were planning to warn him over it (It is, after all, a drug
reference).

Oops. Okay, for stupidly large values of "not too far away", then.
I remembered your location as being even further south. My bad.

Just so long as you don't start a halfling druid <g,d,r>
Those damn things must be more common than rats on Norrath, you
can't swing your long sword without impaling one.

Well, in that large an area, you'd have to stalk an impressive amount
of shops... If you really want to find locals playing the game, go to
a "cyber cafe" (Man, that's a stupid name. Is the cafe integrated into
the human body, then, or what?). Usually two games being played in
those places; EQ and Halflife Counterstrike.
