The HIV Muppet character is only in the South African version of Sesame 
Street. Unlike in the U.S., HIV was never confined to risk groups in 
Africa, where it is infecting millions of people, mostly heterosexual 
women, and children born with the disease.  The women get it from their 
husbands who have more than one wife, or who frequent prostitutes (some 
of them transsexual) or who keep secondary households in addition to 
their legitimate wives.  For these children, HIV is a daily reality. 
There are millions upon millions of AIDS orphans in South Africa.  One 
of the best ways to reach people with public health messages is through 
popular media.  Commercial messages are already propagated through 
product placement -- look how well media glamorization of cigarette 
smoking has worked!  Adding an HIV positive character does not mean that 
the African Sesame Street will be having sexual content -- just that an 
issue which is very much part of the lives of many of the children in 
the audience will be treated in a way appropriate to their understanding.

Keep in mind that in most cultures, like that of mostly working class 
black South Africans, children have a different role than they do in the 
middle class U.S.  In the absence of child protection laws and universal 
access to education, and in the absence of social workers and other 
profesionals who work with children, kids as young as 4 or 5 run errands 
unsupervised, may work for cash, may be forced into prostitution 
(especially orphans and especially since many Africans mistakenly 
believe that sex with a virgin will cure AIDS so there is a growing 
market demand for child prostitutes -- horrible though that might sound, 
a reality), etc.  Sesame Street for these children needs to deal with 
the kinds of problems they have, which are very different from the much 
more minor problems of protected U.S. middle class children.
