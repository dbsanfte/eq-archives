Why don't you go post this on Whineplay?  It's certainly
similar to the quality of the vast majority of posts there.  I'm
sure Verant will seriously consider the valid points in
your complaint and address them with alacrity.

I guess all those other companies who use the empty space
on CD's better stop putting bonus material and demos on them.
Scott may get angry and throw poop at them.
