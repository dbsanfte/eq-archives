    Sounds like a typical Fear raid for people to whom the armour is a
significant upgrade over what they can afford to purchase in EC. Levels
46-52 or so, so dragon levels. Slightly off-topic to the "is a Shaman useful
at 60" discussion, but it is about raids.

>Fear, unless you're killing CT, is not a raid.

    And Sang misses the level of the poster entirely, either because he's
sticking closely to the original thread topic or because he can't imagine
people below level 58 to 60 going on a level-appropriate raid. I imagine
it's mostly the first part.

    Answer: Juggs aren't raided by people levels 46 to 52 for their armour
drops.

>Level 50 mobs stopped becoming a "raid" about two months after Kunark

    No, it stopped being a raid TO THE LEVEL 55 PLUS PLAYERS. There are
people in EQ below 55, you know. Many of whom would LOVE planar armour,
because they simply don't have better or access to better.

    Recent story: top guild on my server's web board. Thread on all the
people they remembered from the early days of the server, sort of a "where
are they now/those were the days" thing. They went on and on about how much
fun raiding the planes was back then, and how they became close-knit as a
result. Very next thread, same guild whining about "why does everyone hate
us when we trample a raid to get to CT or Inny, we let them loot the
armour!" It's almost as though a guild has a memory that only stretches back
to last month.

    As for the original topic: there are no slowable mobs on your "not a
gimp" list. I'm guessing there's a reason for that - the extreme power of a
shaman slow. Imagine farming ToV without a single shaman attending. That
tells me all I need to know about how useful a shaman is in the end game. He
can't help kill the final boss mob? Darn, all he got to do was allow you to
plow through every mob between the zone and the boss mob without breaking a
sweat. Sounds like a "useful role" to me.
