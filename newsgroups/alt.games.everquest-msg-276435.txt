Yep the changes to con colours means EQ2 it pretty much 100% soloable.
The only things you have trouble with are very large mobs and raid
mobs. Anything marked as heroic (ie for groups) are now perfectly
soloable when they are green. It you want to take them on at blue or
above you would need to group. I'm led to believe that's the same in
WOW though.

There's so much more solo content now compared to when the game was
first released. People used to hit a brick wall in the 20s for solo
content but that's not the case any longer. Don't believe the people
who claim the game is not soloable. That's most definitely not the
case.
