Now this is MY idea of a guild event! I may have
to create a character on the Bertox server just
because >:-)

Onebadmutha, a deserter from the Freeport militia
woke up from his lazy slumber out of the West
Freeport gutter, to the noise of yelling. It was
Jigglypimpf, the first season druid, who spent the
days shouting "sow and port for donations", and
promptly hiding after receiving coin from gullible
adventurers.

"It's been proclaimed by the citizens of Norrath
that Sunday, April 1 is to be Beggar Appreciation
Day, a day of gift-giving to take place at the
Freeport Arena," Jigglypimpf exclaimed to the
unkempt legion whose ranks seemed to grow with
every tenday. "They must have finally realized how
important we are to their travels. For without us,
who could they give away that heavy coin and hard
earned loot to? Come, let us get bound at the
Freeport arena so we can receive the bounty that
we so richly deserve." Onebadmutha polished his
family begging cup with this newbie tunic. "Today
I shall earn a Wurmslayer. To the Arena!!!"

Date: Sunday April 1
Place: West Freeport Arena
Time: 5 PM EST

The Warlords of Steel has gathered Antonica's most
infamous beggars at the Freeport Arena. All
players are invited to the First Bertoxxulous
Beggar Bash. For a mere 2 pp, you can show your
favorite beggars how you feel about them. Those of
you who cannot make it but still wish to attend
(including citizens from other servers), please
create Freeport resident and make your way to the
Arena ahead of time to participate as a beggar.

100 pp cash prizes will be awarded to the best
beggar name, best beggar actor, funniest beggar,
the most creative beggar basher, and biggest
overkiller.

Lisboa Bixiestinger
Guild leader of the Warlords of Steel
