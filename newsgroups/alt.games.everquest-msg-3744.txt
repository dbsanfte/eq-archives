If you ever end up grouping with a L56 shaman, admittedly a way off.  Acumen
will keep your stamina at full.  Else you will need regular Invigorate or
Extinguish Fatigue cast on you.  Not a good weapon in Kedge Keep for
example!  Carry it
with a lower fatigue weapon and alternate depending on the group mix.
