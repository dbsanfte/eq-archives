In reality you can post in whatever manner you see fit as there are no real
rules (ask any spammer) to the newsgroups and since most pay for the
connection and thus have the right to decide for someone to claim the only
proper way is "A" and anyone posting as anything else is "insert insultive
here" is nothing more than childish banter. I've also seen an increase in
the claim that if you dont provide a working but anti-spam email address
your a few other choice names. A simply stupid idea being the hsitory and
attitude of the party's in some of the newsgroups. Nothing more than some
trying to define what they think is the right way for it to be.
