Personally, I don't really think people should go around begging for
SoWs, TPs or buffs at all unless there is a really good reason. (NOT
merely because it would make your life easier for a short while.) 
Also, it is the beggee's RIGHT to be judgemental in determining
whether the beggar should be assisted. It should never - let me repeat
that last point - NEVER be simply expected.  Wilt Chamberlain (famous
NBA star for all you non-Americans who may be unfamiliar) is 7 feet
plus tall. That doesn't mean he should clean his neighbors gutters for
them so they don't have to go to the trouble/expense of obtaining
ladders.

In all actuality, I am in no way against helping people out when I
can. In fact I go out of my way to do so under the right
circumstances. However, there are some reasons I may turn down that
last-hp-bubble-walking PC or that naked-cr PC:

1. Plain and simple, if you wanted free SoW or TP or anything else
available to you whenever you need it, PLAY THE APPROPRIATE CLASS.
That is the easiest way to have it without paying for the service.

2. You wouldn't walk up to a public works employee cleaning up a mess
in the street and ask him to walk ahead of you, sweeping as he goes,
so that you don't have to walk through any litter, would you?  IT'S
THE SAME THING.  You are reducing that person (PC) to your personal
unpaid servant just to make things a little easier on you for a while.

3. There should be some sort of learning process for people who
continually bite off more mob than they can chew. If someone is always
there to pamper them with an easy CR, they will continue to make the
same mistakes and continue to rely on others to bail them out.

4. Not lastly or least, there is the cost and/or inconvenience to the
caster.

The RL equivalent to a lot of these "beggars" are bums - the dregs of
society - and I have nothing but contempt for them. Likewise, my
feelings carry through to the world of Norrath. No, it isn't RL, but
it IS an RPG meant to be a simulation of an alternate world, and in
any world, there are common sense, common courtesies and consequences
for your actions.

I will always be one of the first to help those in true need and only
those who are interested in helping themselves as well. I have no use
for nor do I give concert to any other beggars.

Common sense, common courtesy and responsibility "make the world go
round."
