Noticed a couple months ago after one of the patches the graphics of the
skeletons on my computer have changed.  When fighting skeletons, they appear
to be standing there not hitting.  I look over at hubby's computer and they
are fighting normally.  On his computer when they have a weapon equipped and
are sitting, they are sitting there nicely back straight.  On my system they
are just a pile of bones, including my own necro in skelly illusion.  Their
running animation is also different on my computer.  Is there a certain file
I need to delete and repatch to view these normally again?  Thanks for you
help.
