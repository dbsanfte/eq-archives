Has anyone else suddenly gotten "barely burdened".  I have almost nothing in 
my bags and still I am maxed out in my weight  265/265.  Last night I was 
carrying half of Norath and weight was not an issue... Tonight, 4 
items.....maxed.

All of my items are 100%
There is no red stats in my "P"

What gives??

Help me Obi-wan, your my only hope.
