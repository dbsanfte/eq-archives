I"m still soloing dark blue mobs at 60.  There are some HP regen mobs
out there that might make this impossible, but there's little out there
under level 50 that I can't kill one of.  This has been true since at least
my mid 40s, with TBoots and my own buffs only, I can kill pretty much
any lower dark blue mob I can single pull outdoors.

A manastone would cut my down time, and perhaps raise my kill speed
a little (some mobs I do have to med a bit to get sufficient mana to
finish the job) but wouldn't do much to change my target list.

Given a full range of FT items, focus items, and the mana regen boost
off the 8th shawl, and I'm sure I could solo more effectively than
several of the other classes on your "solo better than a cleric" list,
just as I"ll grant you a nicely equipped warrior can outsolo a normally
equipped cleric.  The rogue... I'm not sure I'll ever be willing to
grant you the rogue can outsolo a cleric.
