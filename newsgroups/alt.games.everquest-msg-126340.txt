A warrior friend of mine once told me that warriors, every few levels or so,
begin doing more damage because their "Damage cap" goes up. I play a bard,
level 13 at the moment, and am doing the same damage I have been since level
8 or so. When do Bard Dmg caps raise, as other melees do?

If my info is wrong, please correct me. I am used to playing INT casters and
thus know very little about melee classes.

Thanks!
