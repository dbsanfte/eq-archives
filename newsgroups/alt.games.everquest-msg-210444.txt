I have always been under the impression that Haste was something like this.
Weapon Delay -(Weapon Delay * Haste)
hence
delay 40 - (delay 40* haste 21%)= 31.6

It was just recently that I realized that this formula was wrong...
Say you have 100% haste, then

delay 40 -(delay 40 * 100%)=0

That is not right. Is it?
