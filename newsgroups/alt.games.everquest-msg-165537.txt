Nope.  Some of our not-so-glorious leaders of the time were quite
eager to be bit players in Britain's Imperial Asian Shop of Horrors.
Can't argue with that.  But what does that have to do with Brits
being in any sort of a moral/ethical position to decry American
imperialism.  These aren't people saying "We really fucked up, but
now we're trying to do better, and we believe you ought to do the
same.".  These are people ascribing "evil" to the U.S. as if we had
invented it and held some sort of monopoly.  My point would be that
this isn't a U.S. thing, or a Euro thing, it's a people thing.  And
all the U.S. bashers out there conveniently forget little details
like our restraint compared to comparable historical predecessors
(Britain, to pick a recent example), and the fact that the bad
behavior of our leaders, public and private, routinely provokes
self-examination and internal political debates that frequently blunt
or reverse particular "imperialist" policies, current and historical.

To return briefly to the Opium War.  It wasn't the U.S. that sent
warships to protect opium traders when the Chinese goverment tried
to interdict them, it was the British Consul General of India.  It
wasn't the U.S. that siezed Hong Kong, it was the British.  It wasn't
the U.S. holding a near monopoly on opium production and violating
China's sovereignity to force their goverment to allow the sale of
a debilitating drug that it had banned, it was the British East India
Company and the British Government.  The fact that Americans were
involved as bit players doesn't in any way mitigate the evils wrought
by British Imperialism.  British rants about American imperialism
are, IMO, pretty fucking pathetic.
