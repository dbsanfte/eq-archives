The BA4 bracer isn't a parchment turn in.  Instead, there is a rather easy
quest to obtain it.
A lot of mages seemed less than excited when the BA bracers came out.  After
all, mages aren't doting; what are they going to do with these bracers?  The
best answer is give them to necromancers of course.  BA4 is a difficult
focus effect to come by.  There is now a type 3 BA4 augment, which is
probably the easiest route to obtaining BA4 for the average player.  The
other BA4 items include a pottery crafted item for which the rare component
only drops off mobs during the event to get the key for Saryrn's Tower,
Shadow Knight elemental mold arms, an earing from Saryrn in Plane of
Torment, a staff from Vex Thal, and a staff off of a Sol Ro mini.  There may
be something in Time with a burning aflliction focus, but to the best of my
knowledge these are the only BA4 items, none of which, save the mage
summoned bracer, are particularly easy to come by.

"I imagine soloing dot casters would want this item, I'm talking about in
exp groups... or raid groups, but I've been on very few raids with mage so I
can't say about that; BA seems to be one of the least popular mage focus
item lines."
Yes, I usually try to bug a guild mage for a BA bracer in the odd event I
feel like soloing.  I do, however, dot during xp groups and on raids.  Most
raid trash mobs barely live long enough for me to get a single nuke cast,
but in VT the trash mobs have a ton of hp.  I use Horror for often its full
duration on almost every mob and if there is an Eom occationally I'll throw
in Blood of Thule, even though it won't last the full seven ticks.

Even if you don't get asked for the steel bracer very often, you should do
the quest to get it.  Your necromancer and shaman friends will thank you.
