...in your opinion.

I've heard people say bard is best solo'er, beastlord is best solo'er,
mage is best solo'er, druid is best solo'er, necro is best solo'er,
wizard is best solo'er, and ranger is best solo'er.

It seems there are a lot of opinions on the best solo class!

My personal experience (which is limited) is that necro is the best
solo'er and that mages are overrated as solo'ers (no sow no snare no
root no mez no crowd/add control of any kind).
