Well, mezzes don't take much mana but if you have no click stick a bard is a
great one to rez first.

Enchanter mezzes are better than bards BECAUSE they last a LOT longer.  My
mez lasts a 1:36 minutes and costs only 125 mana.  That's a lot less to deal
with than a...what...18 second bard mez?  I'm NOT dissing bards but the
greatest CC bards (and CC bards are rare) can only MATCH an enchanter who
does it for a living (there are lots of bad enchanters just as there are
lots of bad bards).  Even with a cheap-long-lasting mez I'd rather have a
bard rezzed before me watching my ass while I med up to do what I'm "paid"
to do.  Bards have saved my ass countless times...I love bards.

That reminds me of this weekend's raid that I led.  I'm not an experienced
raid leader but I'm not a newb either.  I led one to Fear (for my epic), but
it was taken by an uberguild 10 minutes before we got there, so that they
could do some armor farming.  Oh well, shit happens.  We had a backup plan
to go kill the Prince in Chardok for another of my epic pieces.  I didn't
know (call me a n00b, I don't care) that having a level 40 in the raiding
party is stupid...I do NOW.  We had a huge group...it was to be our first
Fear raid as a guild + invites and we didn't want to die.  Thirty-six
people.  A serious joke by uberguild standards.

I was one of 3 C2/AQ enchanters and despite always getting at least twice
the number of critters expected we were keeping them mezzed and the tanks &
casters weren't breaking them.  I mean, we were kicking ASS.  Well, we
pulled the Prince room and for whatever reason (either the 40 bard or the
goobers were weren't against the wall) aggroed his whole room to us and
everyone died but the FDers.  Respawn time is pretty quick but the necros
rezzed me (to loot prince) and a 58 cleric (for rezzes).  Unfortunately we
weren't able to recover fast enough to deal with the room spawn so everyone
but the FDers died again.  The 60 necro waited until the monks got all aggro
and gated out (was bound in BW by chardok).  He came back in and immediately
started summoning corpses as their owners made their way back to Chardok.
On the way someone picked up enough coffins to get what he couldn't, so no
time was lost there.

Total CR time, about 45 minutes.  Not too freaking shabby for what we were
doing.  It didn't stop a couple people from complaining bitterly later,
though.

Those complainers are not invited to any future raid...if they don't have
patience for a CR then they don't need to be raiding.
