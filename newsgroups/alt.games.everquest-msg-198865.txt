Just a quick question about surnames for the group.

Is there a way to change an existing surname for a character?  I seem to
recall that GM's would do it for weddings, but is there any other way to do
it?  The reason I ask is that my fiance has a character with a surname that
she wants to change, and I couldn't find a way to do it.  Any help would be
appreciated.
