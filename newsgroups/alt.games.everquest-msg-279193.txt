The Equipment Gap

by Loral on June 25, 2005

"Remember how Kunark came out and suddenly players and items were just
so much more powerful than in the original game? Remember when Velious
came out and it seemed at first that items were only increasing in
effectiveness by a small margin? Well, throw the curve out the window,
students, because there is not just a gap between good items and
awesome items, there's a freaking canyon."

- Moorgard, 29 June 2001, Mobhunter

Over the past few weeks we have talked about the fan faire, the new
expansion, and some of the new directions SOE has taken Everquest. This
week I thought we would take a step back and talk about a topic in
Everquest that has been around since the days of Kunark: Equipment
balance.

No doubt this article will ruffle a few feathers. My intent, however,
is not to focus on one particular style of play but instead to look at
the details of this topic that often get lost. If all you see is "Loral
wants better gear for the casual gamer again" then you're probably not
reading hard enough.

There comes a point at the highest levels of the game when equipment
can double the power between two equally leveled players. This
generally only happens at the highest levels, right now between levels
65 and 70.

Consider these two pieces of equipment:

Faithbringer's Breastplate of Conviction: AC: +125 Str: +30 Dex: +25
Sta: +30 Cha: +25 Agi: +25 Fire Resist: +30 Cold Resist: +30 Magic
Resist: +30 Poison Resist: +35 HP: +315 Mana: +355, Mana Regeneration:
+5, Regeneration: +10, Avoidance: +10, Shielding: +5%, Spell Shield:
+6%, Effect: Blessed Healing Aura: Increase Healing by 50%, Focus
Effect: Keldovan's Light: Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 25%, Required
Level: 70

Plate Vest of the First Order: AC: +72 Dex: +12 Sta: +12 Wis: +12 Int:
+12 Agi: +12 Fire Resist: +13 Disease Resist: +13 Cold Resist: +13
Poison Resist: +13 HP: +125 Mana: +120 End: +120, Required Level: 70

I want you to pay particular attention to the last part of these two
lines: "Required Level: 70". These items are designed for the same
level character. Yet the power of the first item is well over twice the
power of the second especially when one considers the focus effects,
regen, mana regen, avoidance, and shielding.

No doubt the difficulty in acquiring these items is vastly different.
One can be purchased from the Dragons of Norrath vendor after
completing somewhere between 7 and 12 missions. The other requires
drops from the Arch Magus or Overlord Mata Muram in Anguish.

Obviously, these items don't compare in either power or in the
difficulty to receive it. However, there are some areas where these
items must be compared.

Encounters are based on levels, not equipment. At level 70, the same
creatures are dark blue to you regardless of your equipment. The same
mobs give the same experience regardless of your gear. Yet, based on
the power of your equipment, an encounter could be either impossible or
trivial depending on what type of equipment you use.

At level 70, level no longer accurately describes how powerful you are.
Yet systems in the game continue to use level as a way to determine
encounter difficulty. Lost Dungeon adventures and Dragons of Norrath
missions scale their content based on level, not equipment. The Omens
of War Task system and the quests given to you in Dragons of Norrath
are based on level, not gear. Some of these are trivial to
well-equipped players and impossible for the rest.

Even those with the best equipment expect growth yet they cannot get it
from single-group hunts. Not everyone raids all the time. There comes a
time when even high-end raiders want to get together in a group of six
and fight an appropriate challenge. At the highest end, even the most
powerful single-group areas offer little reward for high-end raiders.
High-end raiders cannot increase their equipment power in single-group
events. This leads them towards a "raid or nothing" attitude. Why
bother hunting anywhere if there is no reward for doing so?

One single-group hunting zone or mission cannot challenge both
single-group equipped players and high-end raid equipped players. No
challenge will be acceptable to both groups. I hear it often.
Riftseekers is too easy for raid-equipped players and too hard for
single-group equipped players. The only players who seem to find the
perfect challenge in this high-end zone are those who happen to be
equipped with Time or Elemental gear of roughly 150 hps and mana each.

The power gap will come back as a hot topic when Depths of Darkhollow
brings us monster templates based on level. If these templates are
built around single-group equipment, raiders will find them extremely
low powered for the level. If they are built around raid-level
equipment, they will be more powerful than many players' main
characters. The only answer is to base them on single-group equipment
and accept that raiders will find them extremely low powered.

How can SOE begin to close the equipment gap? There are few, if any,
easy answers. It isn't just a matter of offering better equipment for
single-group encounters. Doing so devalues the reward of higher-end
raid encounters.

It is not unreasonable to expect that the absolute best single-group
equipment available should meet 75% of the absolute best raid-level
equipment. If a cleric breastplate from Overlord Mata Muram includes a
50% healing focus and 355 mana, a breastplate from the hardest
single-group encounter might offer 250 mana and a 35% healing focus.

Even with gear 75% of high-end raid gear there isn't anything to say
that difficult single-group zones will still be impossible for
non-raiders. In places like Riftseekers that extra 25% power makes the
difference between success and failure.

A more difficult solution would be to add some sort of "legendary"
status to items. Items with this status could have different statistics
when used during a raid than they do when used during single-group
events. This lets equipment balance out during single-group events but
meet the proper requirements during raid events.

Another solution, also radical, would be to add in a Dungeons and
Dragons style "power level". Equipment and levels could combine into a
single power rating that determines the difficulty of an encounter.
However, after playing 3rd edition D&D for a year now, the power level
in D&D isn't very accurate and doesn't help much when matched to
challenges. There is nothing to say that a power level in EQ would be
any more accurate, but perhaps it would help.

Every new expansion increases the power for both raiders and
non-raiders. With the recent addition of slot 9 augments to Dragons of
Norrath gear, single-group players now have customizable armor
comparable to Elemental and Time level armor. More of Norrath becomes
accessible to more players with every increase in power.

However, it is clear that Everquest becomes very gear dependent at the
highest levels of the game. It has been this way for the last four or
five years and I see few ways to fix this problem without radically
changing the game. As it has been since the days of the Ring War, the
topic of equipment power will always continue to be a hot one.
