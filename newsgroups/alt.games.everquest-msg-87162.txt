Ummmmm...... no. That's partly right, partly wrong, and 100% confusing.

The trivial level is, first and foremost, the skill level at which you
can no longer get a skill increase from crafting a particular item.
Example: Let's say combining item "x" and item "y" in your sewing kit to
make some piece of armor trivials at sixteen. This means that if your
skill is anything *less* than sixteen, each time you combine x and y,
you have a chance of getting a skill increase whether you succeed or
fail. Once you reach a skill level of sixteen, every time thereafter
that you combine x and y, whether you succeed or fail, you'll get a
message saying that "you can no longer advance your skills from
combining these items." (Or something very close to that.) Now that item
is "trivial" to you. This doesn't mean that you will succeed 100% of the
time....... you won't. But you'll succeed a LOT more often than if your
skill was far below the trivial level.

You certainly don't need to have your skill *at* the trivial level to
attempt a piece and have a chance of success. In theory, with a
tailoring skill of two, you could combine all the required items in your
sewing kit for, say..... some monk's black panther armor. (Requires some
INSANE high skill level to do.) There's still a *CHANCE* that you could
succeed and make the piece. Of course, the odds are probably such that
betting single numbers on the roulette wheel in Vegas would begin to
look like a sure thing, but it could happen. 

Generally speaking, the closer you can get your skill to the trivial
level of a given item, the higher your odds of success on any given
attempt. But you can, and will, try most of them before you reach that
level. Otherwise, how would you get there? ;-)
