Yeah, from the golem area, follow the right wall just past some steps 
there will be a building with an entrance that is slightly right and 
directly out from the steps (bit wide steps, not the ones you probably 
came down to get to the golem area), go into that building, up stairs, 
follow around through there until you find a hole in the wall, drop down.  
Where you drop there is right next to the ramp leading back to the entry 
area, if you head away from that ramp, you will be in the nobles area.  
Levitate is not necessary for the drop, but it doesn't hurt to have it.
