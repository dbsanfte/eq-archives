A very disturbing thing happened to me yesterday.  Myself and my longtime 
ingame boyfriend were to be married.  We had arranged for a guide to 
preside over the ceremony in the Combine Valley in the Dreadlands.  When 
the guide showed up and saw we were both male he refused to perform the 
ceremony saying it was against company policy.  I played UO for a number of 
years and was married in a same sex ceremony.  I don't understand why 
Verant has to be so regressive compared to other role playing games.
