Diablo2 is run on far fewer "realms" and doesn't support the massive
world that EQ does. EQ has 42 "servers", each of which is really a
cluster of about 4 machines to run a rather large world. Battle.net
throws up banner ads from their sponsers. Battle.net also is far more
prone to lag and other problems. In short, EQ costs a LOT more to run
than Battle.net.
