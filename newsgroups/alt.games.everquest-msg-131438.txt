All of the changes you experieced are controlled in the EQCLIENT.INI
file. I don't see how the file could have been changed without outside
interferance. (eq another person). If the file is damaged or missing
it is recreated with min settings.

Have you recently used an editor on the file? Has someone else played
on your machine or started EQ hit "options" and tweaked the settings
without logging in?
