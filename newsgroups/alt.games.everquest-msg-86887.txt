I offered 60pp for a port to trak the other day. Paid 30pp up front,
30 on delivery; I was in such a desperate hurry I was ultra
paranoid, stupid.

The fucker took forever to zone - my guild was about to take trak,
and they were going to call the CoH guy down, after 5 minutes holding
them up I decided my porter had gone LD and ran to Seb. Just as I zoned
in I got a tell from him...

"Where are you?"

I explained what happened and apologised. Got a (deserved, I suppose)
"Whatever." from him.

4 days later, with him on my friends list I spotted him online. Was he
surprised when my little druid poked him and handed 140pp over with
profuse apologies? Well yes, he was ;)

FWIW, I made Trak, won my tooth and now have my shiny VP key to play
with... and he has a hell of a lot more money than he expected and the
warm fuzzy of knowing that not everyone is playing "lets burn the druid".

Lol! I shudder to think of the first thing I encounter upon logging in
being an angry bizbee staring me in the eye ;)
