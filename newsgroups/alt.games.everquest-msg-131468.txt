the other night, because his group was KSing mine (i know i said i was
retired, but oh well), a gnome SK shouted, "get out of our fucking camp, you
jerks"  . .. something like that

so i /report <his name> and /petition "this fella is using some profanity in
/shout . . . could you maybe take care of this as you see fit?"

(admittedly, it was a low and cheap thing to do, but if he wants to start
problems, i'll fan the flame when i know i can't lose)

little while later, a guide tells me i should turn on my filter so as not to
be offended


WHAT BULLSHIT !

(i've seen plooters walk, i've seen monks train soooo consciously - tell a
GM it was an accident / play dumb - and walk, scammers walk, etc . .   i
REALLY want to see a fuckhead bite the dust . . . anyone who pays $13/month
knows someone who plays eq like its their job to ruin everyone else's good
time . .. and while this gnome wasn't *that* bad, it seemed cut and dry that
he should be reprimanded, not walk)

i say to the guide, "isn't using profanity wrong?" and after a long pause,
the guide goes "I'll forward this information to a GM"

come ON people, i know some players have come mighty close to a suspension
for swearing - not always even "fuck" but saying "@sshole" or something more
lame

is this guide full of it?

before i spend a few hours training that guy's group everytime he logs on
(which i probably won't get around to doing anyway), what am i supposed to
think now? discipline going out the window? if i'm on pvp and get corpse
camped (that's legal), its also legal to make threats, use profanity, and
harass an entire zone with "/shout f-- that f---'ing muthaf--- and i'll
f--'ing cut his g------- throat with his own hand after i f---ing bite it
off with my muthaf0---ing teeth" . . . or is the guide i'm talking about
just a dip ?
