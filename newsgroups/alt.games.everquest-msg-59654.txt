You wouldn't likely get much for the pitchatka if you sold it, sorry.
You need both 1hs and 2hs for a warrior (1hd is actually more important,
even tho' verant try to improve on 2hders the hit/miss ratio that will
always occurs is too much of a penalty on slow 2hders for them to be viable
to a main tank) I'd actually say, while just into the mid levels, try and
get some skill in 1hb and piercing as well, you will likely need them.

As a warrior look for at least langseax's (6/23 1hs) expect to pay 20pp at
the most (you can do the quest at your level if you wish to spend the time)
Silvery War axe, Beserker Axe (both 6/22) or Walrus Tooth (6/22 +3 str +6
sta piercer) all around 50pp
The Black Alloy weapons are within your reach to get in a decent group but
don't expect to find a pick up group in Runnyeye (ask any farmers, politely,
to make room for you..I say politely because they'll likely have extras drop
and let your party loot) There is rarely anyone but farmers in Runnyeye.

If you wish to make plat and have the time, cull bandits in WK (get a map so
you can find all the camps) and hand their sashes in for exp, coin and a
bronze weapon. The humans drop bronze weapons and sashes (sell the bronze to
merchants...don't weigh yourself down with it) and the Barbarians,
occasionally bronze. You need to hand the sashes to Chesgard in the Paladin
Guild in Sth Qeynos. This yields decent plat for your level, it is a bit
boring mind you but if you do this off peak to the US then you'll likely
have all the camps to yourself, will slow down your levelling tho, the sash
reward for exp is not great after 20.
