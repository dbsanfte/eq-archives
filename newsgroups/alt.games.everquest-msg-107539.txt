You'll notice that I haven't espoused the latter viewpoint, and I really
haven't seen it here, except for the druids that pull it out of some dusty
closet to throw up as a strawman.  Druids are insane soloers, no one but
hughes can deny that.  I've never turned one down in a group unless we had
two other healers.  There may need to be some fine tuning to be done, but
druids are still one of the most capable classes in the game, the fact that
they aren't clerics doesn't change that.  Clerics can't do many of the
things that make druids what they are.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
