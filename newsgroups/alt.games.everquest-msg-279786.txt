	Well, I remember seeing a screenshot of a high end raiding warrior and 
seeing that his hitpoints were 8.5k (!) I used to think that was 
impossibly uber and that I'd never be anything like it. The day I hit 
10,000hp for the first time I certainly didn't feel uber, and still don't.

	Presently I would put my uber-bar, for an SK at the following 
requirements, met with typical group buffs, not fully raid buffed:

	1. 12,000hp
	2. 2400AC
	3. >=10% shielding
	4. >=dodge 2 and parry 1 or parry 2 and dodge 1
	5. some +avoidance

cheers,
James
