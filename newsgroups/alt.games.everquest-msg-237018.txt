I would accept the account, but I wouldn't take gear off the
characters or play them right away either.

It's important to play through the low levels at least once in the
game. You'll learn a lot about the game. Just jumping to 65 won't do
you or anyone you play with any good.

I would use some of the plat to equip myself reasonably well. But,
leave him a couple hundred thousand in case he comes back. Many
players do.
