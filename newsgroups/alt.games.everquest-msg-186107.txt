From the shadows, the mysterious "David & Lia Robin"
<drobin@attbi.com> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

>What should I twink a Paladin with on a budget of about 3.5 k?

Actually, contrary to most the advice you've been given here, skimp on
the armor to a degree and go for the best weapon you can get (two
handed). For the prices you are looking at one of the DN drops (like
velium brawlstick) would be a decent option. Oh yeah, get a fast cheap
1h weapon (doesn't have to be much good otherwise) to tide you over
until your damage cap comes off at 20. 

The armor (as long as you got something at least a quarter decent like
blackened alloy) won't be a factor when you are blasting things out of
existance in five hits at L25. You'll get a chance to upgrade that
later.

Go for the weapon first. You won't regret it.
