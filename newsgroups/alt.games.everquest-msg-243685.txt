How and why?  It was certainly an odd idea, and having it apply only
to humans was particularly weird... but from a utility standpoint, a
character with a single level of a utility class, starting over in a
new class, was often a very viable idea.  Starting from high level and
running as a new class without the other class's abilities was...
well, not so good, I'll admit.

Nonetheless, I didn't really come to any conclusions about how it
would work for EQ purposes; perhaps we could discard the "don't use
your powers" prohibition, for example.  This wasn't so much an actual
proposal, as a talking point (or shall we say, a proposition)

What about a 59 warrior/1 druid, with 59 warrior hp and defenses, but
casting snare?  Its not so much the even distribution setups, as the
"add a little bit from column B" ones that tend to benefit from this
sort of thing.

If One MC plan is better than Two original classes, then its a net
loss.  But if its only better than ONE original class, there's no
loss.  And since 16 classes choose one is only 16 choices, but 16
classes choose two is  256 combinations (including the original 16),
it seems likely that there would be more than 16 viable combinations,
in which case a net gain in choices.  Even if only one combination in
eight is viable in the end, you'd still have 32 choices.

But that would only cover the possibilities where the two classes are
at roughly the same level; what about the 64/1 combinations, the 61/4
combinations, the 60/5 combinations, the 57/8 combinations, the 56/9
combinations (points picked for "new spell level" breaks) etc etc.

What would suck about this would be that the classes which have been
superceded by the new alternatives would be ones with a lot of play
time already invested.  But since all classes would be able to
multiclass, what would have to happen for a class to be superceded
would be for there to be not one of the 16 choices (remain pure, or MC
with any one of the other 8) that's viable.  That's possible, of
course, since the classes weren't designed with this multiclassing in
mind; for example, perhaps no SK class makes sense with the existence
of warrior/necro combinations

You're probably right of course, I just thought it might be amusing to
think about.

Assume, for example, that resistances for spell casting, and any level
based calculations (damage, duration) are based on your aggregate
level.  There are LOTS of low level spells that would still work
pretty well.  I know my cleric was casting quite a few level one and
five spells up thru level 60 or so... flash of light, root, divine
aura, stun all come to mind.  Assuming they aren't resisted by the
mobs my level 55 warrior/5 cleric is casting them on as though I had a
level 5 cleric hiding behind me, I don't think I'd mind not having
Blinding Luminescence, Immobilize, Divine Barrier, Force... sure be a
lot better spell layout than 60 warriors have.  Is that enough to make
up for only having say a 57 warrior's HP and AC and hit capabilities? 
Maybe, maybe not, depends on what assumptions you are using as to how
much the 5 cleric levels help.
