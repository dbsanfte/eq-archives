Guess I didn't think of it from the XP point of view.  What a boring way to
get XP though!  I seem to recall hearing once or twice that XP was capped at
four Levels above the player, so to a 10th Lvl PC, a 14th lvl mob gave as
much as a 44th lvl mob; can anyone confrim/ refute this?
Also, haven't there been other NPCs that didn't fight back, with a boatload
of HPs in the game?  I remember one in the modified Befallen, and isn't
there a Bloodmaw (Bloodclaw?) kodiak in GD?  Guess I'm due for a bit of
flaming here, because the idea of setting up on a 'safe' NPC to practice on
while I make dinner sounds really tempting...sorta like a practice dummy
mentioned in another thread here.  Perhaps that is what was patched earlier
this morning?
