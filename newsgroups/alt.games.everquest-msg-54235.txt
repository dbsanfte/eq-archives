Well... it's obscure if you haven't heard of him before, if you have heard
and/or read of him, he's a well known character. Judging obscurity can be
very subjective.


 I just did an Amazon search on both Mesmer and Freud.  I got 1

Ther's also Clement Freud, a (former?) Liberal MP and celebrity chef in
England, who is a nephew of Sigmund. Doubtless, there are others.

I guess that the only judges of how obscure someone or something is in
relation to an Everquest name, are Sony employees.

I wonder what happened to the name petition, did the GM's ban the name?
