For bards, yes indeed.

For mages, I think being able to move with a pet while invis, or just to 
invis up to med, will be a great benefit, and using pet get lost or 
reclaim has always been superior to invising to kill a summoned pet.

Further, since certain people have group invis, and bards a group invis 
song, you could easily see your pet destroyed by some numbskull in your 
party (most often, a bard coming to join the group, who uses Selos Song 
of Travel to get to the group, and doesn't turn it off before accepting 
invite)

For necromancers and SK, well, they don't use "summoned" pets, they use 
something else (I forget the name), which is clear if you look at focus 
items.  So my question is, does this mean their pets are still destroyed 
by invis?

And, speculating further, is that somehow a good thing?  I don't think 
it would benefit them any more than it would mages; easy for them to 
kill pets if need be, and great to be able to move around invis -or- 
ITU, as needed.
