One thing to always remember in unrest is if someone shouts run or Train
then *RUN*. Right then, straight off, no waiting to see what it is, just
run. At any level below about 25 any train in unrest will crush you.

This does not mean don't go there, but be ready to flee at a moments
notice.
This is one place where you do *not* turn off shout and ooc.
