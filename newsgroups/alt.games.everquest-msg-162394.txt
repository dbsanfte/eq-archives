The ranger *should* be close to the warrior on offense since the
warrior is a defensive class. Sure the warrior puts out some heavy
damage, but not near the heaviest and only so that they can maintain
aggro and take all the damage in return.

Also, rangers should, of course, be the most skilled with a bow, but I
see nothing from a classic fantasy profile perspective that indicates
they should pale in comparason to a warrior where damage output with a
blade is concerned. Rangers are fierce, well-trained fighters in any
sense. They learned their archery skills on the hunting grounds -
their swordsmanship in the arena and find themselves in one setting or
the other quite frequently.
