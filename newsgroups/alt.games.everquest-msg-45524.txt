I'm not sure this qualifies as a scam, but another "steal from your fellow
players"
technique is to invis up, or hide and sneak, and then wander around certain
zones looking for people going into odd corners.  Dollars to doughnuts that
person is going to drop some stuff to transfer, then camp out and camp back
in with his alt to pick it up.

They stay invis till you log, then pick up your junk fast before you log back
in, and either leave or reinvis quick... you'll never know who did it, and
if you -do- happen to catch em at it, you'll never be able to prove it, and
Verant specifically refuses to protect anyone dropping stuff on the ground.

Oh, they also make a point of checking ovens, forges, and the like periodically,

like someone checking the coin return slots in pay phones... might get lucky and

find someone using them for transfers!

Safe Sex technique: never drop transfer.  Prophilactic for those of us who are
too lazy to do it right every single time?  Get See Invis running, or at least
don't
transfer in towns, use out of the way spots in less traveled zones.  The guys
doing this are generally low level, and also are not interested in hanging out
for
days hoping to spot something, they are looking for high traffic areas where the

odds are greater they will spot someone doing a transfer.
