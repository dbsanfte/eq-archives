I could not agree more. The high level game of EQ sucks, and sucks bad, at least
for me. Requiring huge blocks of time and huge amounts of people. It starts to become
more like a job than a game. Organizing people, planning a raid, etc. etc.

The average casual player like my self can't devote hours and hours to go on
a raid. Most raids are barely getting to the good stuff after 3 hours. Pretty much
when most people have to log off.

I just want to get together with a 'few' friends kill a few monsters, gain some levels,
loot
their stuff, buy better stuff so I can go kill bigger monsters. In other words to gain
progress in the game. Is that so hard to understand?

The monk nerf was just silly, what was the point? What were they trying to accomplish?

For me this game is great for about the first 30 levels. You can make decent progress
for your time spent. You can play in lots of places. You can solo a little, and group a
little.
30-50 it gets harder but you can still solo most classes, you can get by with a single
group most times. Then at 50+ it starts to bog down and become tedious. Leveling becomes
glacial, downtime becomes horrendous, solo is restricted to a few classes. You almost have
to join a guild to raid get better equipment, then you have to deal with all the
organizations
and the politics any large group of people requires. I have to deal with that shit in real
life
I don't really want to deal with it in a game.

Having said all that, I do think Verant does think of the casual player sometimes.
Recent additions to the game have made it better. Like adding the PoK so people
can get around faster and not waste time, adding flowing thought items and more
mana regen things to reduce downtime. But the core high level game still remains
a chore as Bodi said.

It almost seems that Verant/Sony has a schism between having to cater to uber
players that have no life, play 16 hours a day, level to 50 in a week and beat
their best mobs, and having to satisfy the typical casual player.
