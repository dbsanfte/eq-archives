    I imagine it's a case of internal logic. The races in question have both
halves of those hybrids already available as classes - gnomes can be
warriors, clerics, and necromancers, and halflings can be warriors, druids,
and clerics. What I'm wondering is if those new classes will also receive
support in the form of newbie quests in their home cities, and if the other
classes in those cities (gnome rogue sticks out here) will also get some
newbie quest support.
