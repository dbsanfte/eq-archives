I have a friend who used to play UO. I believe he said he had a character
who had charmed animals and monsters, and was able to keep them in
a rather permanent way. He is thinking of playing EQ.
I just looked through CastersRealm, and it seems that he is going to be
disappointed with the Beastlord.

The BST can't charm any creature, right?

How do normal animals see a BST (amiable, warmly, indifferent) ?

thanks
JT
