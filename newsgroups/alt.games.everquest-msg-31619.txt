Sure, he can be a drunk all he wants. But "Wantsomedrinks" is NOT a
name that fits the environment in any way, shape, or form.

Because neither of these are blaring violations. Bait Masterson
actually takes the right "frame of mind" to twist around. It's also
been explained as a referrence to something completely different than

I don't see where you're going with "Spoolie Gee"...
