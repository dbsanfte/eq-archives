The NK bridge was used to parallel a transaction whereby I'm claiming to 
sell you the Brooklyn bridge... perhaps it was a poor choice.

If you'd prefer to use an ingame item like stacks of blue diamonds that 
works too. If I offer you 50kpp for 100 stacks of bluediamonds, and you 
give me the diamonds and I *don't* give you the pp has fraud occured 
*that a court would would recognize*?

Its obvious that fraud has occured. Its not remotely obvious that a 
court would recognize it in my opinion.

Ah... and that's the crux of my argument. *If* we establish that pp and 
the items have real value in USD, then what difference does it make 
whether its 'purely in game' or not. Its just choosing a different currency.

On the one hand, if we agree that pp has monetary value (and we'd be 
fools not to) its merely a difference of coice of currency. In other 
words, pp *is* money, and the courts would *have* to recognize it. This 
is a VERY VERY VERY scary proposition. It leads to all sorts of 
problems: on Rallos Zek, I'm killed and my 1kpp is stolen... can I call 
the police and have him arrested??

On the other hand, if we assume that the courts have no interest in 
fraud (and property crime in general) that occurs *purely within a 
game*, then, by definition they will have no interest in the scam that 
was perpetrated against GoM, becuase no assets outside the game were 
affected. All the "real" assets are exactly where they started, and only 
in game money got moved around so the extent of the fraud is purely in 
the game. Ergo, by the assumption, no legally recogized fraud has occured.

Thoughts??
