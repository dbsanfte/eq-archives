Of all the races to choose from to add to the player base and they
choose Frogloks??? BAHHH. Why not... Orcs. That would be interesting.
Or better yet, Centaurs. OOO or an undead race - would be cool to play
a skeletal warrior. A frog?? How cute. Heck, Id take a grimling before
a frog (well .. maybe not, yelping "Oi!!" everytime i got hit would
get annoying fast). Or a Minotaur race might be cool (although im not
curious enough to play shadowbane to play one).

Hmmm. Then theres goblins... naww... we get enough butt crack from
trolls. Next, well see Bixies as a playable race. Or Faeries (ohhh we
have wood elves already =p).
