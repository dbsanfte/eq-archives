However, that only applies if you are using the official patcher.  If you
are handy with XML and accessing stuff on the web, it's possible to write
your own patcher, that doesn't have such restrictions.

http://patch.everquest.com:7000/patch/everquest/everquest-changes.xml.gz

is the file that lists all the files that are part of EQ, including
timestamps and sizes and checksums, so the patcher can figure out what needs
to be patched.

If you look at the contents of that, along with the list of URLs that the
patcher accesses during a particular path, you can figure out without too
much trouble what it takes to write your own patcher.  Here's what files
were accessed when I ran the patcher today:

I obtained this by simply setting Internet Explorer to use the web server on
my Linux box as a proxy, and then running the EQ patcher.  If IE is set to
go through a proxy, the EQ patcher will go through the same proxy.  I then
simply looked at Apache's access log on my Linux box.

Hmmm....if I wasn't nearing EQ retirement, I'd be tempted to write an EQ
patcher to run on Linux.  I'd then share my EQ directory on my network, and
mount it via smbfs on the Linux box, and run a cron job to check for
patches, get them, and apply them, when I'm not playing EQ, so that whenver
I want to play, the patches have already been applied.
