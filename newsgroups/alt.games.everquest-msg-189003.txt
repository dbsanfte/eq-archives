Give up now. Smithing is pernicious. It will eat your face.

If you're still there, the race of your smith should probably be
dictated by your server's marketplace. My smith is an ogre because, at
the time, there was only one 250 ogre smith on my server (and they
have since retired.) Ogres also have the advantage of high base
strength.

Buy all of the strength you can at start, unless you plan to play this
character. Then, buy all the stamina you can get. Strength gear is not
that hard to get. My ogre's smithing gear gets him to 255 STR and 141
CHA simultaneously and cost less than 15k. You want to max out str and
get CHA 135+ before you start.

Get yourself a Geerlok hammer before you start banded. Smithing is
EXPENSIVE and how far you go in it is a function of how much you fail
on combines.

Getting to 188 is fairly easy and will cost about 20k. If you've
gotten to 188 and think smithing is hard, quit. Post 188, smithing is
both hard and expensive. You will spend a ton of time farming, a ton
of time on components, or both.
