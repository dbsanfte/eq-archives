Well, games like Fifa or Quake3 have usually a max amount of players.
Football games have 25 characters max, some games in Q3 can go up to 36, but
that's pushing it and with 36 you definately don't want highest graphic
resulotions or details.

Everquest must be able to handle 40+ players around, not counting monsters.
This plus the high polygon count on the new models with seperate armor items
"floating" around them I think it's amazing they kept it this low :)
