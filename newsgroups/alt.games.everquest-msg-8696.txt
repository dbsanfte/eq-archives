Sure, I know where your coming from. I hate it as well. That last blue pixel
just sitting there.

/gsay 'This next kill should get me a Ding :o)'
You have killed a ...
/gsay 'Erm.. maybe this next kill'

Lol

Still we all do it, take the rough with the not so rough and just sit there
bored of the same mobs coming to die. But while you are doing this getting
the exp, it is just like working. With reward of another level as your pay
cheque. Get higher lvls and go to different zones, new tactics , new mobs,
new people. All a big adventure :o)

There is so much to Everquest that you need not be bored all the time. Try
some quests or wander the lands. Ultimately you will suceed in gaining
higher lvls until you can battle the likes of Dragons but you'll find that
even in the 50's and your sitting in Old Sebilis you'll find yourself
yawning after yet another mob like the last one LOL. * Looks at his watch,
only another 1000 kills before lvl 51, bummer , died make that 1500 kills*
