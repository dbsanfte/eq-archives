I think F9 actually cycles through all the different cameras, but it
may well be true that the first one it shifts to is top-down view.

I bound shift-F9 to top-down and ctrl-F9 to first-person view, and
shift-ctrl-F9 to wide-angle view.  I can still use F9 to try other
views, but being able to get to those three quickly is useful, IMO.

Yes, top-down helps in the bazaar too.  The other view that works well
there is first-person but "looking down", i.e. use Page Down to shift
your view to look at the floor.  That gives even less view than top-down,
so you really need to use the map window to navigate.

Of course, since the last update you can use the Hide All Traders button
in the /bazaar window, and that gets rid of most of the lag (except near
the banks, where there are lots of non-trader players).
