The apparently didn't like being a "major label" band and preferred
being obscure indy artists.  :-)

FWIW, the second major label Refreshments CD, THE BOTTLE AND FRESH
HORSES is really, really good too.  Shadows of what was to come with
The Peacemakers.

As much as I'd like to cast aspersions on other's musical tastes, I
have a Wilson Phillips CD moldering somewhere in the back of my closet
somewhere....

What can I say, I was in high school.

They gots a website at http://www.azpeacemakers.com/ and a discography
can be found at http://www.azpeacemakers.com/music.htm.

Enjoy!  Feel free to spend some money on Roger and the Boys.  :-)

Oh yeah, and the disc HONKY TONK UNION is worth getting just for the
song "Jack vs. Jose".  :-)
