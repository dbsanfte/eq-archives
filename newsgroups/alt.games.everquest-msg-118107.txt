Friend of his went to Legends. Friend went to ST. Friend got mask.
Friend decided to quit game. Friend was transferred back to EMarr
first. My guildie 'got his stuff' :)

I think he is toying with the idea of selling it so he can get *all*
his other dream upgrades. I've told him I'll smack him if he doesn't
charge over 200k if he does that.

Another guildie recently got a Lodi shield for 39 k. Grrr.
