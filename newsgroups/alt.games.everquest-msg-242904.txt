Any Guildmaster of your class can train you. It is level capped and
once you put a point into it, you will get skill at the level that you
are at (I believe). So if you didn't put a point into research until
you were level 20, you get Research at 20.

Research is the creation of "new" spells for you (or for sale). Some
spells that you can research are actually available from other guilds
(e.g. clerics and shadow knights, etc.). Some spells are research
only.

You need the appropriate container to do the research combine. As a
necro, you need the Book of Dark Bindings.

To create a "new" spell, you will need to put the appropriate Words
into the Book of Dark Binding and hit combine. If successful, you get
a spell scroll that you can scribe into your spell book (if you are of
necessary level). If unsuccessful, the words disappear. You can get a
skill up in research on a success or failure unless you have reached
or exceeded the trivial level for that spell.

There are recipies which details which Words are needed for which
spells, you can find them in-game or on the Web. Words drop from mobs
of the appropriate level of the spell you want to research, so a lvl
16 spell should drop from a lvl 16 mob (up through lvl 20 or 21). So
you can go hunting for mobs (random drop so you may kill lots of mobs
and get squat for research words that you can use). Else you can check
out the vendors on PoK and elsewhere. The bazaar is a possibility too.

Some Words are for Magicians and are not usable by necros (and vice
versa).

The Concordance of Research is a means to do practice research. You
know about getting skill ups in your skills? This is the way to do it
with research. It can be clumbersome and you may find it easier to
just spend training points to max out research (gets costly as your
skill goes up).
