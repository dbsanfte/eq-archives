Thought i would mention that there are a fair number of regulars
holding public raids on Nagafen and Vox to score epic items for the
"public" -- the red scales, the white scales, paladin books, and so
on.  Plus some of the loot is REALLY good.  The Cloak of Flames from
Lord Nagafen is extremely nice and I know of at least one member of a
top-tier PoP raiding guild, possibly one of the top five melee players
on the server, who still wears his cloak of flames (he is level 65
with many many many AAs).

Just something to think about.  Not every server has a robust public
raiding system, but ours on E'Ci is quite good and definitely worth
hangin at 52 for a while to pitch in.  It's fun seeing a bunch of
level-52 Barons and Baronesses too.
