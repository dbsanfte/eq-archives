Can't you just turn off the luclin textures? There is an option within the
game (on the login/payment/options? screen) but you could also change the
settings yourself in your eqclient.ini file by setting all references to
luclin as false. It's common sense when you load up the file in notepad so
you'll see what I mean.

Other things to try could be to turn down the clip distance, turn off spell
effects, lower particle densities, turn 3D sky to single layer, lower your
resolution...
