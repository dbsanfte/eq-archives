Well, the cheap option for this is a Spyglass, which costs about 25pp for a
gnome tinker to make, you might have to go as high as 100pp to buy one on the
open market, but if you are looking at a raiding guild they should have someone
on staff that can make these for you at cost or at least not at an absorbitant
markup.

Its an annoying item, since the proc (telescope) is a vision magnifier, wrecking
your accustomed visual range on everything, and since you are using it in a
dispeller enviroment, you'll be zooming in and out as you lose it and reapply it
again and again.

There's also an earring that inst clicks grim aura, and I think something that
inst clicks see invis; bracelet of the hidden?  The thing to do would be to go
to the bazaar, dial up your race and class and "all effects", then look thru for
the cast times.  You aren't necessarily looking for something actually useful,
the buff in question is really just there to be dispelled.  But as you note,
you're best off with one that works indoors or out, people who have JBoots for
their outdoor buff protector still have to go begging on an indoor debuff mob.
