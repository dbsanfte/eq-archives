}I've used Mappie for a while. At first just to make the map lines dark 
}enough to show up on my screen.
}Then they added a compacting routine to remove surplus or overlapping 
}lines. This halved the size of the GuK maps I use.

Ok, so how do you do exactly that?  I suspect it has something to do with 
the mass color change option, but I was being entirely incompetent at 
getting it to work... I may have been trying to change the wrong color. :) 
Also, any advice on colors that show up on that stupid tan background over 
a wide range of gamma settings?
