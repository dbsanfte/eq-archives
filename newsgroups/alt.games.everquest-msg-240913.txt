yeah, i heard fishing could be good if you know where and how to do it, but
i also hear that it is a waste of time and probably makes the least amount
of money.  so, if it does make money, can anyone tell me where to go to fish
for the big bucks? and if it doesn't make money, tell me now before i go
wasting my time with it (of course, i'd probably still waste my time with it
cuz its kinda fun, but i don't want to get too into it if it won't really
help me in any way).

also, i heard that fishing is most profitable when mixed with the cooking
skill (or baking or whatever its called).  seems logical to me...anyone know
the recipes that sell for the most?
