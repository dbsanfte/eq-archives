    Well, we still will have the hot sauce around for non-revenge
purposes.  Lenny, for some reason, likes to have a bottle of insanely hot
stuff around for I dunno, bragging rights I guess.  We both like our food
fairly spicy, though he has much more tolerance in that regard than I do. 
I will probably use this stuff, drop at at time, to do things like warm up
the beef we use to make tacos and things like that.

   At $10.00 a bottle, it's not that expensive.
