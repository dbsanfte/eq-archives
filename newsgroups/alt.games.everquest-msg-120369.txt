Yes.  In fact, most mobs you'd want to solo are slower than jboots.
Generally, aside from things like tigers (and wolves?), mobs are usually
only faster than jboots if the mob is a ranger or druid or shaman mob, or
hangs around mobs that are.  E.g., an orc shaman will SOW himself, *AND* SOW
random other orcs he comes across.

Those spiders that were giving you trouble are rangers, and so any that are
level 30 or above can SOW themselves and others.  (This is one reason some
non-rangers were pissed off when SOW was changed from level 39 to level 30
for rangers...most of those spiders are between those two levels, and so
that became a much more dangerous place with that patch).
