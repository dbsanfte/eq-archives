Your friends are full of shit, then. I've got several characters above
level 29 and have never bought plat. There are level 60+ characters in
my guilds that have never bought plat or anything from sites like
these.

By the way, Yantis only owns Mysupersales, not playerauctions.

No, not from corrupt GMs. Players sell to him, and he turns around and
sells it to other players for more. Once again, your friends are full
of shit. That, or you're a terrible troll.
