how dare u correct that?????????   many people have misspelled proper in
that fashion.  since that is it's common usage, it is correct.

similarly, idiots r 2 lazy now 2 use capital letters.   according to u, the
languange has evolved.  the peeps have spoken, capitals r no longer needed.



I'd also note that there are more idiots making that mistake on the net than
there are in Everquest using the word donation incorrectly.  So according to
you, it's even more correct.

And yes, thx is an acceptable abbreviation.  If you're a lazy idiot, it is.
