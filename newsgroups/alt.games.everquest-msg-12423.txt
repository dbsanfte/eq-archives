You know, I dont buy it. The AC, defense and HP are bloody
close at everythiing below 40-45 and rangers have marvelous
aggro management tools like root if they know how to use them.

I think theres either:

a) a hell of  a lot of stupid rangers
b) a hell of a lot of people who listen to the high end game on
mboards and dont adjust to how it applies lower down
or
c) drugs in my water supply

I guess the safety margin thing might have something to do with
it but... a ranger should be able to switch aggro to anyone he
likes if she uses root sensibly...

Blaugh....
