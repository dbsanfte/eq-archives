It was just revealed yesterday by Moorguard that they've taken body
customization out of EQ2.  You can still go wild from the neck up, but no
more adjusting height, weight, cleavage, etc.  

I'm so bummed. :(  Those bastards.  I should know better by now. *big
sigh*  here's now hoping that at least they get the default models right.

(You warned me Frank, I know I know...)
