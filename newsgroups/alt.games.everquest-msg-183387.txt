Your analogy is invalid, since the "battlefield medic" heals, which is
what the cleric does without requiring any "tools" from the
recipiants. There is no actual real-life equivalent to HP buffing.

At any rate, why is it bad for the cleric, who doesn't personally need
the HP buffs, not to carry the dots, but it's okay for the tanks, who
do, not to? You're asking someone else to front expenses for you.
Rather rude to think you're entitled to that...
