I'm just wondering how many Luclin "discoveries" will be made on AB. It's by
far the biggest uberserver now with a serious overload of players.
Heck, at any given time the list of "/who all <classname> 60" gets cut off
because of too many players listed. Now THAT is scary. (I tried this with
clerics, warriors and monks up to now)
