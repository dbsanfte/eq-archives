That would work for the lower levels, which I suppose is the target audience,
since the lower level charm takes no mana, and I could certainly load invis to
break charm faster.  This would still require that the PL person be capable of
doing at least some damage to the mobs.  I've done similar PLing with a cleric
using Atone; frankly its a pain to do that way.

At higher levels, I could still use this plan, but since 39 charm requires mana,
I'd rapidly run dry; $50 an hour... but only pay me $25 cause a half hour's all
I'm going to be able to sustain this for (and thats assuming we are taking down
pretty big targets and using charm solely to wipe memory,) then I'll have to go
sit for an hour to get the mana back!

If I was being paid an hourly rate in RL money, I'm sure I'd deal with the pain.

But a druid is a much better PLer IMO; HP buff and regen and DS on the PL
victim, same on yourself, and go out and aggro mass quantities of mobs without
damaging them.  The DS does most of the killing, the regen covers the incoming
damage, and all the PL victim has to do is a single point to each mob before it
dies, to get all the exp.

While the bard and cleric are providing one mem blurred target, the druid is
providing 6 or 8 in the same time frame.  I recall doing levels 10 thru 19 in
under an hour with a 56 druid pushing my bardling.  This is the difference
between a decent PLer and a "great" one.

So if I was going to pay someone to PL me, it wouldn't be a bard or a cleric, it
would be a druid, unless someone can demonstrate how another class can do it
faster (paying by the hour, I want the maximum PLing result per hour)
