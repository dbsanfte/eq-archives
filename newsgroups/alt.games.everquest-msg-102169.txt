Bizbee your a repulsive,egotistic ASSHOLE,you obviously think the fucking
world was made for you and no one else is intitled to make a statement
without your cock sucking sewer spouting back.Like your some kind of fucking
genius.This may be the case in EQ,because you have no fucking life other
than the game.However in the real world,if you were ever man enough to face
it,would leave you flat on your ass crying to mommy. Wipe your nose and get
a grip on your acme problem.
