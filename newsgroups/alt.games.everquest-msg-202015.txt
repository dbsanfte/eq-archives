Short for Mobile Object, basically, any of the animals, NPCs, monsters, 
whatnot.

Running around with a mob trying to catch up to you, as if the mob is 
tethered to you on a string.  Usually while you run, you stop, and nuke or 
DoT a mob, or, have your pet, or friends beating on the back of the mob 
while it is trying to get to you.  Also, there is reverse kiting, or fear 
kiting, where the mob is running away from you, and you and/or your pet are 
beating on it while it does so.

Pretty much any direct damage spell, regardless of whether it is fire 
based, cold based, magic based, poison based, or disease based.

A spell that reduces movement speed.

And, you may ask this one too:

DoT - Damage over time.  Any of quite a number of spells that damage a mob 
over time, instead of dealing all of their damage up front like the nukes.
