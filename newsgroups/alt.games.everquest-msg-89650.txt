 Having spent a lot of time there I can confirm it. The big dogs up
front are on VS faction. However the big dogs in the back (Warlord room)
are also on VS faction. As far as I recall those are the only mobs that
give VS hits unless some of the rare named do such as Verix remains.
There should be a lot of camps you could get there and not take any VS
faction hits.
