Iksar to me. Of course, they'r ehated anywhere, they grow slowly because
of the experience hit etc ... but they look the damn best in robes and
their cultural armour. It's not the race you pick for fastest levelling,
but I love em. More polygons because of Kunark, too. I wonder how they'll
look in Luclin.

If you talk about hate: Dark Elves. While they might be ideal for power
hungry powerlevellers, I totally hate their looks, also most of their
amrour looks etc, bleargh. Who wants to walk around as mighty Shadowknight
and look like a blue shrunk flowerelf with these ridiculous skull looking
helmets. Yeach.
