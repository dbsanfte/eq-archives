I've just got to ask how you got him outside?  That's one HELL of a long pull
through a huge ass numer of both undead and live mobs to make it outdoors,
assuming any of the mobs on the way down have repopped while you waited for
Garanel to show up.  Sounds more like a train from hell than a pull.  So how
did you do it?
