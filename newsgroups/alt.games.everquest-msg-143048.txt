Venemous Axe of the Velium Brood's *only* saving grace was that it
proc'ced starting at level 1. Now that it doesn't proc until 35, it's
a total piece of crap. Still, tons of people are trying to sell them
for 2k-4k and it seems like some of them are even being bought at that
price because, "that's what a brood axe is worth."

If you paid more than 100 plat for a VAOTVB post-nerf, you got a raw
deal. Caveat emptor.
