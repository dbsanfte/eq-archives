If you wish to pretend that a series of computer generated video images is a
large expansive world, by all means immerse yourself.  You will be one of
the few, and I put it to you that you will spend more time frustrated by
non-RPers than you will enjoying your immersion, but to each their own.

As I mentioned in another part of the thread, EQ ceased to be a RPG ages
ago.  There are plenty of folks, though, who only have a few hours a week to
play ... the concept of tying up large chunks of that precious time sitting
on a boat or running across a wasteland is a great way to run off your
casual player/source of income.  If it were still perceived as a RPG, this
would be different.  Yes, it has elves and dwarves, but it's not a RPG.

Ben, I've been playing this game for two years as of the 15th of this month
(just did a /played on my first ever character out of curiosity and found
out that my first night was March 15, 2001).  Inasmuch as that character is
only 40, and the highest level character I have is 54, I think it's safe to
say that XP grinding is not something I find extremely enjoyable.

And as I mentioned in a part of this thread that you conveniently snipped,
it's not just XP grinding, it's tradeskilling.  If I'm in some far away zone
and want to tradeskill for a night, I'm out of luck.  I typically have 2
hours to play, and by your line of thought I have to spend an hour of it
running for the pure wonder of travel, going to the bank, buying supplies,
then getting to the forge, kiln, or brew barrel before I can start
tradeskilling?  Sorry, I call bullshit.
