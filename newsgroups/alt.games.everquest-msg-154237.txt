Granted... but paladins are the #1 choice for this as
in addition to fast aggro and AC/HP, they have
LOH and stuns and group heals, all of which scale
pretty decently, while SK have... well, nothing
much that isn't better done by someone else in
a large group.

Now, though, they might have FD coupled with
much better survival AC/HP, making them "needed"
as pullers, instead of pulling being one more thing
they can do but not as well as another class.

Every class should have one "vital" contribution
they can make to a raid, and at the same time
there should be other classes for each of these
that make decent substitutes in a small
raid or group situation.
