Try to go to Sol B, but bring shrink potions.  Also lower guk, if you
feel adventurous.

I was there at 29-32 with my cleric.  Good area, but bring yer own
group.

Not at all.  You're not there to tank, and you have a lot of good
buffs.  Try Dreadlands, or Overthere until 39, and then Dreadlands.

You can stay in Dreadlands until 50, or bored to insanity, whichever
comes first. The only amusing happening in dreadlands is people more
or less accidently aggroing Gorenaire, with the resulting wailing and
gnashing of teeth.
