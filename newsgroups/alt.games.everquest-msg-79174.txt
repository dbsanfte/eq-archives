As much as I can live with that (Killed Slate numerous times myself),
it still seriously offends me in a roleplaying way if - like
last time, two 50plus players (cleric and monk) have the guts
to come into neriak commons and start slaughtering our guards
there. And then those honorlesses bitches of newbies in there
actually LOOT from the corpses of their kindred!
BAH! *spits on the ground in disgust*

I petitioned to ask if in such a case - as it would be proper
roleplaying - I was allowed to train them with other guards,
and as much as the GM gave me moral backup, he was sorry
to tell me I may not do so.

This sucks major ass! I am actually _forbidden_ to
roleplay in a roleplaying game :(

(At the time I had petitioned I had already trained
one guard and one named DEF on them, just good they
didn't notice :)
Then another guard jumped them all on their own and
the monk nearly died - only nearly!
I wanted to cry out loud out of frustration, that she didn't
get her skull split and her brain smashed by the guards blade :(

Death to the foes of the Teir'Dal!
