I think all necros ar KOS to the guard at butcherblock. This isnt
necessarily a problem. The vendor at the BB druid ring is beta neutral, so
at least you can sell stuff there. I dont know about the merchant faction,
but you can check it on izbal brightblaze (near gfay huts) from a distance
(different faction from guards). If youre ok with her, you might be able to
buy food outside kaladim, dangerous of course. Failing that, you might be
able to buy food somewhere in akanon. If it were me, Id just take a ton of
food and go and start training, sell at the druid ring. If you need more,
pay a newbie to buy some for you near kaladim. All the guards are static
spawns, so watch where youre going and you should be fine. I would jump the
boat rather than walk in on the docks. Too many factions there to take
chances with.
