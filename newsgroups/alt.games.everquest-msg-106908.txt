Also possible that it's a matter of timing. It's possible that guides
could see the /reports if it was over a year ago. Or even possible that
they just added it in over the last patch or two. I do know that for a
good while up until quite recently they couldn't. *shrug*.

Oh, I completely agree. There's SO much shit that guides can't do that,
unless they are summoning your corpse for you and/or rezzing after a
server crash, or giving you a lift when the boats are broken again, they
are virtually powerless. (Couple other things, to be fair, but most
anything of a *serious* nature still has to be referred to a Senior or a
GM, *IF* you happen to be online at the same time as one of them. For
most investigations of abuse, bad language, grief playing, etc. etc.
etc. things would go much faster and smoother if the guides could see
them. And conversely, I can not think of one fucking reason that it
could be harmful for the guides to have access to them.
