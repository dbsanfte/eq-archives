Now at 192 which isn't much fun, Halas pies are a major PITA to skill up on
and my sojourn to Greater/Lesser Fay for Pixie parts and Cinnamon ended
when I lost the will to live after collecting 30 pixie dust.

I was hoping to skill up in Jagged Pine but seems my pottery isn't anywhere
near good enough to make a Casserole Dish - five attempts and five
failures.
