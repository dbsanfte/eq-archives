    Well,  he may position it as warning now, but the original post
reads
as a "how to" guide.
   I thought it odd.  Did he think that we would be grateful for for
being
told a way to rip off our friends and get banned?  Maybe he just isn't
good
at setting the tone of his writing, but I'm having trouble seeing the
good 
side of the original post.
