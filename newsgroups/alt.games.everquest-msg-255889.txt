Agreed.  Unless you're an enchanter or maybe if you spend a lot of cash on
KEI, there's really no reason you should know.
I would be interested to know of any 60+ spells that have their duration
determined by the caster's level, though.

It's 150 minutes for the base duration.  5% = 7.5 minutes.

Agreed, of course. The reason people used the percentage is because it is
displayed right in the AA window and anyone can tell that the 45% extended
buff lasts longer than the 40%.

Bah, I already said I had advertised 180 minutes!  I am lazy but not
dishonest.  I suspect you weren't speaking to me personally though, so I'm
forced to agree yet again.  Now that we have it in place, it's crazy not to
use the duration advertising method.
