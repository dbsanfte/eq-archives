    I have a 62SK and duo regularly with a now 61 shammy.

    Words cannot express how unendingly cool this duo is, but I will try to
put a few together to explain it.

    1) Pulling. A shadowknight can single pull from just about any camp, in
just about any situation. Single pulls let a Duo take on just about any
camp.

    2) Slow + haste + heal. Shammy can haste *both pets* and the SK, and
slow every mob. This results in the tiny group usually massively out
damaging whatever mob they're fighting. Shammies get a 1950 point heal at
58, and some of the best mana to hp ratio heal over time spells in the game.
Possibly *the* best, I can't be stuffed looking it up.

    3) Mana regen. Shammies have probably the best mana regen of any class
with the combination of canni and heals. Shadowknights eventually get a
liche style spell that out-mana-regen's c3, and is easily countered in a
shammy/sk duo by regen and heals. Until they get pact of hate, c3 will have
to do. Shadowknights also get a hp-drain proc that converts drained hp to
mana. This spell is almost completely useless unless your dex is buffed to
west bunbery. Shammies buff your dex to west bunbery, resulting in
unbelievably good mana regen from this proc spell. The result is that this
tiny group has a practically unlimited supply of mana.

    4) Agro management. Shammies desperately need a tank who can take damage
well, and build up a massive amount of agro to hold mobs off them while they
malo/slow/cripple/dot. Shadowknights are ranked equal second as tanks in
terms of healing efficiency, and ranked equal first for agro management. We
have no trouble holding agro off just about any class, and the single-mob
pulls we run with shammies make it perfect.

    5) Dots. Both of these classes are dot-heavy. In grouping, dots are
usually a waste of time to cast because fights never last long enough for
them to be worth it. In a duo, fights simply last longer, meaning BOTH the
SK and the shammy can use their unending supply of mana dotting the mob.
Dots have a very efficient mana to damage ratio. When you couple this with a
large mana regen on both classes, you get a *large* dps boost from
continually dotting mobs. Shammy and SK dots stack. I've yet to notice a
conflict between the two.

    6) Snare. Shammies don't have it. SK's do. The worst thing about SK
snares is that they will break mezz because they're a dot. Shammies use root
for crowd control instead of mezz, which stacks perfectly with sk
snare-dots. Snared single pulls combined with massive agro ability allow the
SK to kite the mob around while the shammy repeat casts slow, when it is
resisted.

    7) BUFFS. Shammies have hands down the best melee buffs in the game. In
this 2 person duo, there are *3* melees. The SK, the SK's pet, and the
shammy's pet. Shammy buff's stack perfectly with cleric buffs, meaning if
the SK turns up with virtue, aego, or temp, the shammy will pretty much
maximise their buffed hp potential with te combination of direct hp and
stamina buffs.

    The result:

    This duo has a massive DPS, due to its huge mana regen rate, its ability
to stack dots and convert mana to dps with nukes, the two *perfectly buffed*
pets who can be kept behind the mob in rogue position due to the SK's
top-notch agro management, the SK's hasted 2h dps and the fact that even the
"ghetto mezzed" adds (if you're bringing adds, which is a decision you can
simply make) are taking damage from dots.

    Combined with the huge ability to soak up damage and continually
recover, this duo is capable of handling camps that most people believe a
full group is needed for. This duo can haul in experience like you wouldn't
believe, and collect ubah lewts in places angels fear to tread. This duo
fucking 0wns.

Kind Regards,
James
