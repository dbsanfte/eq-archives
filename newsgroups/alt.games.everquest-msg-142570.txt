A smithing geerlock - "Automated Smithing Hammer" or something very like -
adds 5% to your smithing. It is tinkered by gnomes. You can often find these
for sale in the bazaar, or through a local tradeskilling guild. I've seen
the price range from 200 to 1000pp each on Xev. I think I paid 500pp for
mine. You could probably get to 165 smithing skill and be happy with a
geerlock.

I do not know any other items that modify smithing (except of course the GM
trophy, but that's only for folks with 225+ of a skill already and yer not
going there). Ask your favorite smiths if they have anything you can borrow-
you may be able to just rent a hammer from a friend for your purpose.
