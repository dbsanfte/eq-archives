I came across this.  I was in Erudin and was wondering what this gnome
was doing there.  After figuring things out, I got xloc'd to the docks
in Erud's Crossing.  On the docks was another gnome standing in front
of me.  But he didn't respond to hails.  So, I figured he was acting
as the "end point" of the xloc.  And since I was at the dock, I
assumed the boat would be by shortly to take me the rest of the way.

So I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  The boat never showed up.  I,
too, could not figure out how to get from Erudin to Qeynos.  I had to
gate back to the firepot and run from Halas to Qeynos.

Those without gate are hopelessly stuck in Erud's Crossing.  I
couldn't imagine waiting in Erud's for two+ hours waiting for a
petition to be answered.

This was a month ago or so, and I assumed that since the xloc's were
removed from OOT, they would have been removed from Erudin->Qeynos as
well.  Guess I was wrong.  It's sad to hear that the xloc is *still*
broken.  OUCH.  How many petitions will it take to get this fixed?! 
And why replace a broken boat system with an even MORE broken xloc
system?  At least with the broken boats, a person can head down to the
spires in Tox.
