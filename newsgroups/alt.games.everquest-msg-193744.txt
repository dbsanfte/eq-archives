Does the necro FD work the same way?

A necro friend of mine got a mob down low enough so he started running via
DD and pet damage (no dots).  Once the mob was in run mode, he pulled the
pet off of it and FD'ed.  I then proceeded to kill it but I did not get xp
for it.  Is it because that FD is different or maybe the pet damage?

Thanks!

Rom
