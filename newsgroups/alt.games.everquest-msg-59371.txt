You don't say specifically what earrings you have, but you could probably
get some obsidian bead hoops from Solusek A, drops off a named drake called
Singe,  blue at 30, probably soloable by you, a 30 druid and 32 ranger had
no problems with him AND 4 gobs, stats are 2ac 3int/agi, magic but not lore
so you could get 2, I think of them as the int-caster Forest Loop.  =P

Ring-wise you could get a Ring of Frost, drops off snow dervishes in East
Wastes, possibly Iceclad, lore, 3int 10mana, not quite sure if you're high
enough level, though I believe so.

While in Solusek A, you could probably camp the goblin Barkeeper for some
drake-hide arms/legs, as long as you had a bit of help to break the spawn.
Arms are 4ac 3sta 10hp, legs are 5ac 5dex 5cha.

Now that the TLC is gone from Warrens/Stonebrunt, you could go kill the
Prince for a Cloak of the Forlorn, 2ac 3int 1sv magic 5mana, but -3wis (not
big for a necro).

If you still have any raw silk/gossamer/damask on, go to Crystal Caverns and
kill some spiders and make yourself Crystalline silk for those slots (or go
window shopping in Thurgadin),  same to one more ac than raw silk, but 1-4
sv magic on all pieces.

Go slaughter most of Runnyeye for a Black Iron Medallion (3int/wis neck) or
get help to take down the battlewizard/lord Pickclaw for a Black Alloy
Medallion (6ac 5int/wis neck).

Savant's cap from Unrest for a hat (2ac 3int/wis head), and while you're at
it, Dusty Bloodstained Gloves (2ac 25mana gloves) off the same thing
(reclusive ghoul magi on the second floor), also in unrest, off hands, Ivory
Bracelets (3agi 20mana wrist, not lore)

If you don't have better, do the Harvester (4ac 5str 5int -5cha permanent
deadeye) quest from temple of SolRo
http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=703

If your server has the old Befallen, go down to the third level and get a
Dagger of Marnek(3/30 3int 15mana, lore) for either your primary slot or
range.

If you have good Coldain Faction, go kill giants (might have to get a couple
levels though) and start working on a Prayer Shawl, the first two just take
10 frost giant toes(NOT ice giant dropped by Gornit and ever/perma ice
giants) and 4 kromrif heads.
