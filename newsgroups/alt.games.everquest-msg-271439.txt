"Framerate" is a bit misleading, I suppose, although it does come into play 
just a bit.  More of an issue with me was stuttering and the inability to 
completely get rid of it no matter what I tried.

My perception about framerates comes from long experience with flight sims 
rather than FPS's which I don't play.  I would only consider framerates to 
be a real issue with a game like EQ2 if it was a constant slideshow, which 
it wasn't on my machine--not even close.  But those "dropouts" I experienced 
were almost as bad because they have a habit of showing up at inopportune 
times.  Like, what you relate as problems when a lot of players were on the 
screen, I also experienced as a problem during combat much of the time--not 
good at all.

Heh, I can even bring up a flight sim comparison--EQ2, graphic wise, reminds 
me of Origin's Strike Commander, and if any old flight sim buffs see this 
they'll know exactly what I'm talking about, I think. :-)

But how to check the framerate in EQ2 I don't know unless there happens to 
be a current version of an old program called FRAPS that I used in sims a 
lot that might work with it.
