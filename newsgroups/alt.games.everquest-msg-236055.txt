Thats where I am, mobile, al.


Their latest line uses the slogan "you gotto eat" and I just dont like it.
its really not all that bad but I think the commercials themselves are
inconsiderate to the overweight, it mentions at some point in the something
about not being able to resist. having no choice, you gotto come eat.  im
fairly easy going and dont get offended by much but I found that offensive
as hell, I infact do have a choice, I can resist, and will never eat there
again.
