Oh, for the love of God.  Look, I like convenience as much as anyone - I really do.  I
appreciate the gesture.  And yes, from now forward I'll be mousing over my buff bar every
few minutes, if for no other reason than just "because."

BUT...this is another of those stumbles down the slippery slope of making the game
environment so convenient, so safe, that the charm of the game is lost to endless XP
grinds and chain raids.

I can hear it already: "Gotta gate to PoK in 5m26s for some fresh crack.  Plan yer bio."  

The joy of a fortunate risk goes sorely lacking when everything is calculated in advance.
There's no risk in knowing that your mana regen buff is going to wear off in 5m26s, or
that you'll get do void your bag in 5m26s.  Live on the wild side!  Take some risk!

What's next, an augment for Anizok's Gauze Press that will allow it to magically wipe your
ass when you come back from your 5m26 bio break?

I suppose there's some good in this: we'll be able to bust the hooligans who /ooc EXT C3,
but don't have the AAs or effect gear that grants the extended duration.)

Don't even get me started on the PoK teleporters.  And the bazaar.  And the zoning pets.
And the many other conveniences that have been added to the game that were not sorely
missed before their mention.

Zoning pets?  Great for the casters.  But let's get zoning MOBs in next. Make it a random
NPC ability, based on aggro - that should prevent a wayward Chromodrac from flitting into
LOIO and wiping out the Fortress patio camps ;->  Sure, sure, it can be abused (what fun
to drag the Rotting Flesh Hunter into PoK!), but it would enhance the realism of the game
if the Gnoll High Shamans at the LR north dock could chase you past KFC when sufficiently
aggro'd.  Imagine Fippy Darkpaw on a roundabout through Vellious. Grr. Bark bark. Grr.

Best regards,
