One example, and maybe not the best one, is DAoC.  The base classes of
Fighter, Rogue, Acolyte (Priest), and Mage.  Each base class can choose a
different Guild to join at level 5 (limitations apply of course), they can
join (in Albion) The Church of Albion, Defenders of Albion, Academy of
Magic, Guild of Shadows.  A Fighter who joins the Guild of Shadows becomes a
Mercenary, light tank type.  If he joins the Defenders, he becomes an
Armsman, full on Plate Tank, joining the Church gets you the Skills of a
Paladin, plate tank with group abilities and lower damage output, and so on.
Each of these can then be changed by the skills they choose to train.  A
fighter type gets 2 skill points per level to train skills.  A Merc can
train 3 weapon types, Thrust, Slash and Crush, (Each type has bonuses versus
different armor types) and each has different combat styles, each with their
own advantages, our Merc can also train in Dual Wield, Parry, and Shield.
So, based on their choices to level 50, each Merc can be very different,
though quite often this is not the case, a Merc was usually 50 Weapon, 50
DW, and remainder in Parry (sorry I seem to have forgotten the final
numbers), though I have seen 50 Weapon, 42 Shield (an attack style that is a
use anytime, 9 second stun) and (I think) 37 DW, with a bit in Parry.

These training differences become more pronounced in the Mage classes, lets
take a Wizard for example.  Started as a Mage, joined the Academy of Magic,
choose one of three lines of magic, Earth, Ice, and Fire.  Each have some
excellent abilities (though Earth was, the last I heard still lacking in
utility).  Fire Wizards are long range nukers and very nasty at that.  Ice
Wizards have some very nice crowd control, and some amazing PBAoE damage.
Earth's primary benefit was Ground Targeted (Rather than Mob or enemy
targeting) AoE, could make for some amazing defenses when well used.

When a player reached level 40, they begin getting what players called
"mini-dings" a half level mark.  At this point a player is granted an
additional amount of training points, half of what would be received at the
next full level, so at 40, one would get half of the number they would get
at 41, so our Wizard (1 point per level) would get 20 points, but our Merc
(2 points per level) would get 41.  For our Wizard this would allow them to
have an alternate set of spells, and train in a secondary discipline, with
limited effectiveness since they could only train the skill to a certain
level.  Our Merc however, could, potentially, train a secondary weapon type,
or, he could toss in some Shield skill, or more Parry.  I had a Merc who
used crush weapons, and used a shield from time to time.  He looked EXACTLY
like a Cleric running around.  I called it my "Cleric Disguise" and it was
the death of many an assassin type.  My "main" was, of course, Finduilas, a
Paladin I chose the Avalonian race (a REALLY rare choice, as they are the
caster type race in Albion) and I specialized in 2 handed weapons of a
Thrust damage type, great damage versus Midgard Chain armor, and with a
rather high skill in Chants (our Group abilities).  If I recall I was 50
2hand, 29 Thrust, 46 Chant, and 21 Parry.  While I could not kill purple (EQ
equivalent is red) mobs as a Shield specced Paladin could do by twisting his
chants (similar to a Bard's song twisting), I could take on oranges
(equivalent yellow, next in level is a red con, higher than orange and lower
than purple) with little fear of death.

I will not even get into Horizons and their Mulit-classing.  It was WAY too
much, I could start as a Warrior, train as a Cleric, move to Monk, then
Mage, then back to Warrior, then finally to Paladin with some additional
benefits from my additional training, and that is not even a quarter of the
class possibilities available, Druid, Ranger, Spritist...and on and on.

So, yes there are places where such do exist.
