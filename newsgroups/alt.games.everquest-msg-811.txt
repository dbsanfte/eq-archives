I've had to petition several times over the course of time...I'd give
them all a four. They've all been polite and courteous to me, but then
again, I've been the same in return...

One time, I accidentally bought a bunch of bladderwrack herbs,
intending to buy other herbs costing about 2 plat each...I ended up,
after fast clicking seven times on bladderwrack, noticing that I had
spent over 600 plat on those seven ingredients.

The GM said he couldn't undo it, which I thought really sucked,
because then I was broke...but he was very polite about it, and I
understand that some people would have lied about it, so /shrug.

Now, I have seven components for when the time comes to make Gate
potions to (Feerrott?).  <rolls her eyes> Yeah, like that'll ever
happen.
