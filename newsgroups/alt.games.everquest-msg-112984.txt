Bullshit.

I speak with (in-game and snail mail) *a LOT* people whose first language is
not English.  Every single one of them understands what "u" means.

I guess they all have a greater reading/mental ability than you.  I mean if
that looked like utter gibberish to u.... yet my Czech, Dutch, Mexican,
Chinese, Scandanavian friends can understand it perfectly....

You know its bad to assume things.. even more so, when your wrong.  So you
just keep saying/thinking im 12, whatever you need to make yourself feel
good man

who gives a fuck about capitalisation in a game related newsgroup?  Hi, this
*ISNT* real life, its a game.  I don't come here to show off my language and
writing skills.

Thats right, when I don't need to be formal, I don't. Simple as that.   Just
like when Im not in the office, I don't wear a tie.

Come back and judge me when your better than me, and when you actually mean
jack shit to me.
