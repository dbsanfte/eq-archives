No it wouldn't. A game's engine is the looking glass
through which the zones are viewed. If people with
the expansion are looking at the same zones as you
through a different engine that makes their graphical
experience better, there's not necessarily a problem
with it being "expansion-only"

That said they'll probably bring it in with the new
expansion but make it available to all anyway.
