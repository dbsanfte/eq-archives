Since I've been back I often hear people asking for more for dain1.  I've 
ignored it because I thought that was some high level thing and my new guy 
is only 35, but yesterday someone sent me a tell asking if i wanted to go. 
I'd just joined a group so I didnt, but think I oughta learn something about 
it before the next time.  Is it really any level?  Do I need to do any prep 
quests?  Where do I go and what do I do?  I just dont want to waste the 
groups time accepting an invite then not knowing what is considered common 
knowledge at this point.  I have all expansions enabled, and am playing a 
drakkin rogue.
