Incompetence? Yeah right sure. At over $3 million a month I'd sure as hell
would like to have their incompetance. LOL!

Umm I never fail to take Verant to task for poor game design (spell book comes to mind)
but Verant has fixed MANY game flaws. Witness the fixes in the last 10 patches
alone. Something tells me that they would fix this if they could.

You must have just started playing the game because you sound exactly like
all the mindless Verant bashers that used to post to A.G.E. for the first few
months after EQ came out. They'd latch onto one  flaw and rant and
rave that Verant is incompetent, and piss and moan that Verant didn't care
about their customers and that all these new games were going to come out
and kick their ass.

I know because I used to be one of them. Until I realized that EQ was the best
game of its type out there and I'll overlook a couple of flaws until something better
comes along. Still waiting. Still having fun playing EQ, imagine that. Still watching
those fire beetles walk through trees. Yup.

Hmm I'm thinking you got your ass spanked by a Griffin that ate you through
the roof of an Inn or a lion that walked through a door and you are still steamed
about it. So you decide that it wasn't your fault and need to blame Verant for it.
Get over it.

BTW did you ever send a feedback or an email to Verant about this
'incompetence?'
