(Annoying top posting ignored becasue this is a huge subject)

The more I read both here and on the VI boards, I'm beginning to think
it really might be a matter of Intel vs. "Other" processors. Here's
another great example. Lander has a better video card than my new one
(mines a Gf2) the same amount of system RAM, and has a *FASTER*
processor. Mine's a 600, but it's an Intel P3. I'm zoning just fine, and
I was also on a Naggy raid last night. The only thing I turned off was
/showspelleffects (which I always do for any large mob raid) and I had
the best performance I've ever gotten in that lair. Almost zero frame
rate decrease, and I was spinng and running around like mad. Similarly,
our friend Orlun is experiencing like problems with his system which
also has a non-Intel, but faster processor than mine. I wonder if there
isn't just something inherently different about how the Intel processors
handle the flow of data from EQ that is now becoming *drastically*
exaggerated with the higher demands of "EQ 2".
