I would put this one in the mid-levels category. Don't get the pet till 9
and the first dot at 15 so is just like a melee till then or a weak
magician with no nukes (or a weak monk with a pet ) between 10 and 15.
However, pretty much *any* class can solo well till 20ish (cept maybe the
warrior and rogue - too much time with bind wound for my taste).

Move this one into the category above (definately).

Or any level after getting panic animal. Course it might get boring fear
kiting animals only - sort of necroish.

Eh about the same as the Ranger. After getting the puppy what's going to be
the biggest problem - mana management. Although just going to PoK and
hitting a crack vendor will fix that in a hurry. Been away for about a year
and can't get over how much has changed - I've still yet to go there just
for a KEI. Maybe it's all the time I spent in RV in the old days, but I
just think of myself as a beggar doing that (even with "donating").

Good advice as long as s/he tells the next group s/he joins that their
skills are severely lacking. If you want to PL up that's fine but make sure
you work the skills before joining groups. Granted most groups won't notice
but remember Murphy's law.
