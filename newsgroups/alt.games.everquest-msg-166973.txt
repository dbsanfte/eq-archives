Let me explain: I said root bowkiting was overpowered in general. It
is. I didn't say anything about it being overpowere COMPARED TO DRUID
QUADKITING. What I did say is that it wasn't as massively underpowered
compared to it as people were making it out to be. (There were
exagerrations on both ends to inflate the power gap) Druid quadkiting
in itself isn't overpowered. Throw KEI into the mix, THEN it is (Wow,
imagine that. KEI making a tactic insanely powerful...). Without KEI,
root-rotting is more mana and time efficient...
