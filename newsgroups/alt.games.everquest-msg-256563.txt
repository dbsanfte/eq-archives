Aha, but the proc only had to happen once, thats an average of 30 
seconds of swinging the weapon, and then lasts 15 minutes, on every mob 
that attacks me during that time; meantime I'm happily using a real weapon.

Imagine if it was a 250 DD instead, then I'd be stuck using the POS 
forever if I wanted to do the DD, or forgoing it in favor of something 
with a better ratio.

Incedentally, I calculated DPS off a 6 point DS as follows; most mobs 
attack once every 3 seconds, and tend to hit me 3 out of every 4 times; 
thats one hit per second on average.  The DS hits the mob every time he 
hits me, so he's taking 6 damage every second... which is pretty easy to 
figure out, a 6 DPS.  If I'm chain stunning and landing all my stuns, 
the mob I'm meleeing loses about half his hitting time, so now its a 3 
DPS.  Your 4 DPS questimate is right in between the marks, pretty good 
for some made up figures.

With an augment proc, I can put it on my best weapon and not have to 
worry about making choices, of course, but I was thinking in more 
general terms.
