Of course not.  My Precia needs alot of gear.  That's not greedy.  Now, if I
insisted that I had a right to more than my share of gear to make up for
it.... yeah, that's greedy.

Both statements are true, however they do not cover the full story.  Greed
is when you decide that it's better to take more than your fair share of the
loot, as opposed to going and farming to cover your deficiency, or taking
things more slowly so you don't have to become a leech.

> Need is when I require a particular item to continue with a quest.

Again, both true.  But greed is also when you decide that your need for a
particular item entitles you to more than your fair share.

No, greed is when one person decided his need overrides the need of others.
Greed is when someone decides that the concept of "fair share" should not
apply to them.

If he expects someone else to provide it to him?  Hell yes.

What I see is that people draw the line at money.  I could insist that my
paladin loot a deepwater helm because he needs it as an upgrade to his
Blessed Knight's Helm, but a bard who's wearing a bronze helm shouldn't be
allowed to loot the DW Helm, sell it, and buy a Singing Steel Helm.  Why is
that?  I think it's that cash step.  The desire for money is instantly
considered a bad thing.  Due to the way many societies are arranged, the
desire for "fithy lucre," for any reason, is considered greed.
