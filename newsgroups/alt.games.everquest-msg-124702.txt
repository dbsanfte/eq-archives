I am quite certain that is why the list failed on EMarr.  A number of the
uber guilds did actually agree to go along with it, reluctantly, but it fell
apart very fast.  We have one cleric in guild that has only Ragefire to go,
and a second that will be there very shortly, and we don't hold out much
hope of getting click sticks anytime in the near future.
