The major problem with PvP centric RPGs is NOT actually being killed, it is
the MAJOR inconvenience of being interrupted by PKs.  When I was playing UO,
I died a few times as a newbie.  You know the routine, I get tired of
killing chickens; so I head over to the graveyard where an invisible dual GM
tank mage paralyzes me and kills me.  Eventually, I got to the point where I
was not actually killed by groups of PKs, but it was damned frustrating to
have to stop what *I* wanted to do and Recall out of where *I* wanted to be.
I can see that the same problem would exist in this game.
