Pff. I just spent 5 days selling in ec, and this happens -all- the time.  
It's not a matter of the seller having no ballpark figure in mind, it's a 
matter of you call for a price check, get widely varying results, you go 
to eqprices and divide that figure by 2 to get somewhere near the price 
checks, and then someone comes to ask about your merchandise, and you say, 
'well... I think it goes for about Xpp...' and after the thirtheenth time 
someone tells you you're insane and walks off without even making a 
counteroffer, you decide there really is -no- -way- to figure out what the 
other person will consider reasonable to pay.  

So fucking make me an offer already!  I wanna get this shit out of my 
inventory!  I've been here eight hours straight and I'm ramming headfirst 
into the tunnel wall and actually finding it amusing!

Aiiiigh...

Anyone got a sedative?

PC on a Laced Veil?  How's about Seb Scale Sleeves?  Who the hell wants 
these sleeves anyway?
