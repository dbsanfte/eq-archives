The raid feature was added in PoP.  LoY had maps, expanded bank, armor
dyes, the guild tool, the new LFG window, the NPC dialogue journal,
and playable frogloks.  Plus the content, of course.  It also added
charms, but I don't know if you ever needed LoY to equip them.

Some of the features (like the expanded bank) are now available to
everyone, though having no LoY-less account I don't know exactly
which.
