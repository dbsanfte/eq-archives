SonyJapan?  The EverQuest team is based in San Diego, part of Sony
Online Entertainment, which is part of Sony Pictures Entertainment,
which is a division of Sony Corporation of America, which in turn is a
subsidiary of Sony Corporation (the Japanese mothership).  The
Japanese connection to EverQuest itself is, I'd say, pretty distant -
they almost certainly don't directly influence the development of the
game.

And in any case, Verant was a subsidiary of Sony, too, only slightly
more independent, and it was more like Verant taking over SOE than SOE
taking over Verant back when Verant was reintegrated into the colossus.

Calling Brad back is reasonable (though many people are glad to see
The Vision gone), but Verant is still there, it's just lost most of
the people who did the original game, who wanted to move on to
something new.  I doubt it would be any more Verant if the corporate
structure had still been the same.
