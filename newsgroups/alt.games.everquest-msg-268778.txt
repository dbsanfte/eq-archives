As other messages in the thread have indicated speaking to the ambassador
will send you to the duke who then says yu can leave.
In that same area there's a dock with two bells, I think the one on the left
is the one to leave the isle.
It is worthwhile getting your experience level up to 220% (and tradeskills
higher) - everything is within reach and much easier to navigate than Qeynos
to start with.
And you can sell stuff off to get some extra money behind you too =)  I had
10 sp by the time I left.
