So, a cleric + one of those duos?

Bst, SK.

BL's get to be pretty decent damage dealers, they
have modest slows and the all important SoW at 30.

Sk is a superlative tank, allows for some fear kiting,
feign pulling and what not.

I also like bard, sk.  Bard can slow, haste,
mana regen.  Sk as before.  Bard dps + the
extra given by haste is still probably less
than the Bst with his pet.  OTOH I think the
bard gives slightly better slows after they get
Chains.  And of course, mana regen, and CC.
Now that Lullabye is a single target song, they
can practice CC as low as 15.

Any way, that's how I'd go, but I'm sure some folks
can come up with compelling reasons not to :)

Are these 2 going to be played by the same person,
or different players?  Honestly, the best duo is
one where the players really like the class they
are playing.
