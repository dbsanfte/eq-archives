Yep. But thats what ports are for. Interestingly, in Velious they had
'portal teeth' that required you to visit a ring once by foot to collect
the tooth before you could be ported there. I have no idea why they
removed that ;/

Luclin had a different approach. At release it had no ports, but they
gradually phased them in once everyone had gotten used to the expansion
and bored of the travel. 

Shrug. I liked the mad charges racing guilds to Ssra and stuff. But I
guess I was a minority.
