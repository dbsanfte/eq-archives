Thanks for saving me the time to clear that up, as well as correcting
the top posting.

Oh, and for the record, we bring several avaialable post=52's to Vox and

the staging area and with buffs, etc.  Our guld got Naggy last night.
Two CoF's dropped, along with red scales and something else. My jaw hit
