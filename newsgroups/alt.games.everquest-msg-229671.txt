Well, I read it differently at first, but it seems pretty ambiguous from the
original message.

I was initially under the impression that the list of recipes that it would
give you was recipes that you could make from the items already in your
inventory.  So, for example, you have all the pieces necessary to make
arrows but no bow staves and wanted to fletch, it would give you all the
arrow combines you could make from the arrow components, but wouldn't show
you any bow combines whatsoever.

This is the line:

"In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently
available to you."

Does "currently available" mean simply within the skill range they refer to
later, or the recipes you have all the items for in your inventory?  I mean,
if you don't have arrowheads, one wouldn't consider making arrows to be a
recipe available to you.
