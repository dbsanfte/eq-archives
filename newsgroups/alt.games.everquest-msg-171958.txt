I don't have a list of these items, and a bazaar search for various
instruments will specifically NOT show these weapons, sadly.

I'm currently using a Troubador's Mace, drops in the Trial of Execution
in POJ, acts as a brass instrument

I have my eye on a Drummer's Main-Gauche (or something like that) which
acts as a drum.

Other than these, I have no idea, although I've heard there may be a
strings one (which would really help)

Of course, the Epic works as a store bought instrument for all
instruments, plus finally gives us a boost for singing.

I'd love to see the list you are looking for.

Which brings me to the other half of my post.  This is a public forum,
and you are looking for general information which many would be
interested in.  Why request that someone send a link or list to you
directly?  Post here as a reply is the default plan, after all.
