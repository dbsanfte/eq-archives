Turning the Unnatural is level 39.  The Undead Nuke available hits for 
about 150.  His normal DDs are not mana efficient.  And the DD will break 
Root/Instill so he needs a little room to manuever.  It's doable, but wait 
until 39 and will be relatively easy.  35 just isn't a good time to start 
to solo LoY.  He could find a group relatively easily, though.
