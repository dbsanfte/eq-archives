Actually, during the initial debarkle of waking the sleeper, VI stated
quite clearly that using terrain to block AEs was a valid and cleaver
tactic. If a dragon was breathing on you, you'd hide behind a corner,
right? The dragon can still come round the corner and eat you.

What ISN'T acceptable is using z-axis and other AI deficiency 'tactics'
to render yourself completely immune to damage. The most common
variation of this is 'trapping' a mob in it's pathing, so it can only
summon one person per 6 seconds rather than charging down the entire
caster encampment
