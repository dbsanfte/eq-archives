Ya but... only ONE shaman is useful on Idol (if you chose to slow him, which
unless your killing AoW regularly, you shouldn't)

Whats that shaman going to do for AoW?

As for the power of DS... look how Seru first "legit" died.  Well I say
legit, because the key was legally gained.. the DS stacking sure wasn't
legit
