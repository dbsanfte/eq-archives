Same as in EQ for almost all levels when XPing.  Or
are you talking raids only?   No one in EQ2 has the
type of raid experience people do in EQ yet...

Who said they can?    I won't go near some mobs;
regens won't keep up.   A shaman can.   Now, if
I *NEED* to kill THAT mob, I'll get a group that
CAN kill THAT mob.   I'll add DPS or CC or
something.   But I do NOT need to talk
"a_helpful_cleric01" into helping...
