Maybe these suggestions should be put forward to Verant as a way to stop
people from trying to f**k up GM events. It's an in game punishment and
won't make their character totally unplayable, well, as long as they aren't
a tank it won't, anyway.

A friend attacked FV when she appeared somewhere on Bristlebane (along with
half the zone, apparently, poor excuse but nm) whenever he now does (did, he
has quit)anything that would improve FV faction he gets the message "you
faction can't possibly get any better" but he is KoS. This I found fitting
and amusing, although this could just be the fact he is an Iksar SK, can
anyone verify this?
