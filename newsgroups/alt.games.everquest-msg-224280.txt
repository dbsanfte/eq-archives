I normally start a mission having to remove a buff or two so that a
DoT won't be able to randomly kill my mana regen and I have room for
a HoT. But I normally end a mission with only 3 to 6 buffs up (mana
regen, clicky atk buff, haste, and any others that happened to not
get dispelled or fade along the way).  If I'm taking a heavy beating
(no slower and/or a high proportion of nukers) I will ask for HP
buff replacement (or just do it myself), but since I always drop a
couple 'dots on any Cleric I group with first thing that's never a
problem.  Don't buff cheapskates with expensive buffs, it's the only
way you'll ever educate them.

Bah.  If the players who want the HP buff are too damned cheap to help
cover the costs then there's no good reason for the Cleric not to be
too damned cheap to cast the buff.  If you feel duty bound to buff the
graceless jerks carry a stack of Jaspers (under 8gold each) and give
the cheapskates Pinzarn.  It's not as if you're likely to fail a sub-60
LDoN mission just because you lack symbol/temperance (Clerics are just
as optional as every other class for LDoN easy mode).
