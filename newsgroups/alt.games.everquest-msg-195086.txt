<<It is frustrating, and the fact that they don't have a web page or other
mechanism that accurately tells you when you -can- log in is even more
so, but you get over it eventually.  Just one of those things.>>
This was going to be my next question.  I'm looking at everquest live server
status page and according to them most servers are up including the one I play
on but I've been trying to log in for over half an hour and no luck at all. 
Why bother with a server status page if it doesn't work?
Here's the link I use:
