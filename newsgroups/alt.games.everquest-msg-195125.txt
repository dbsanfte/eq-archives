If you read the rest of my post, you'd know.

Its a joke.

Certain races; Iksar, Trolls, and Ogres specifically, have a penalty; it
takes 15 or 20% more experience for them to level.

Humans, Dwarves, Elves (all types including half) Gnomes, Erudites, Vah
Shir, Frogloks, and Barbarians level at the normal rate

Halflings level 10% faster.

Since Humans suffer from quite a few drawbacks compared to other races, and
particularly since halflings who -don't- suffer those drawbacks level
faster, might be seen as suffering a "human penalty".

Rumor has it that humans were -supposed- to get the bonus, not halflings,
this seems to me to make a lot more sense!
