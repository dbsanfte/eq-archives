When I have a job to pay for it myself, I'm gonna go for it. I
honestly thought it was gonna be a pretty corny game before I got into
the beta, but I wound up hooked on it pretty quick. With no real loot
aside from the power enhancements and "inspirations", I thought it
wouldn't be interesting... It's worth a check. Even a PVP fanatic I
know bought the game after playing the beta, and CoH has no PVP...
