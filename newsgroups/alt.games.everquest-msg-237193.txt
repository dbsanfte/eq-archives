Not exactly a newbie here, I have played a mage all the way into the
late 20s.  And incidently I just headed into permafrost (since no one
goes there anymore) and whacked away at the Ice Giants and Gobbies (I
know theres only like 2 mobs that give exp, but at least I didn't have
to worry about wiping out a zone again).  Took me nearly 8 hours but
I'm back where I started.
