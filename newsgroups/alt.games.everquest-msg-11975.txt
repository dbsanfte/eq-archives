I've had a similar experience of being returned to a safe loc in game while
accidentally strafing too far up a wall in EC.  I "fell" from the edge of the map
and was then moved with a message telling me I had been moved to a safe location,
I found myself at the inn nearest to ruins.  The question that crossed my mind:
was it really a safe place for a level 16 (at the time) DE Necro?
