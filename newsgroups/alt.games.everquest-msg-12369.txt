If you know how to PvP, and PK, you will become very rich on RZ (which
you deserve). There IS a lot to learn, however most just assume not
because they haven't bothered to go out and learn it.

And yes, equipment is something that does give an advantage (as it
should). So what your saying is that if I equip myself with enough gear
to get my mr to 200, that I should be as vulnerable as someone with 25
mr when fighting an enchanter? Or that Ice Comet should still do 705
damage whether I've got 25 cr or 175 cr?

If you think about it....there would be several million MORE naked
wizards running around if gear didn't mean anything except in the PvE
game. 

Maybe I'm some sort of PvP god, because I don't get "owned" (ie i die
EXTREMELY maybe once every couple of months, and I pvp every day), and I
don't have the best gear (never been to plane of air, sky,
mischief...only nodrop gear I've ever acquired has been a cryosilk
amice). It doesn't take much to learn how to PvP, however if you were
expecting to sit in a dungeon killing a_dungeon_mob01 all day and then
emerging as an experienced PvP'er then you're pretty mistaken :)

If gear was all thats required....why am I owning people with full sets
of PoG/Kael/Thurg armour and epics? People with 100+ days played on
their accounts, who go on raids for uber-items every night? Because its
all they do, they never bothered to learn how to PvP. Gear helps, but if
you don't know how to PvP, you'll lose those blue diam bracers and
velium diam rings very quickly.

All in all, the only reason people want to change the PvP system...is
because they are, well, the losers of it. They don't want to learn what
sets of gear they should wear, they don't want to learn about PvP, they
just want to make it harder for others....as all they see is themselves
getting killed repeatedly...and this could ONLY be because the pk's have
totally no skill and the everquest engine isn't fair. Wah wah.
