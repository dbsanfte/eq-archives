Are there any caster drops from this hunting spot? If so then I can
understand NBG as long as it's stated when you start with the group (that
sounds petty at a low level but then so is calling NBG imo) if not then
maybe you should point out that calling NBG in an area where only Melee
items will drop is like ruling you and all casters out of any decent loot.

What level are/were you, btw?
