Really?  I thought it was 15%.  Then again, I don't think I've had a lizard past
15th level, and who cares when exp comes that fast?

I will probably never start another frog, I played a frog warrior to 30 and its
probably my least favorite model.  I mean, even with Iksar I can tell the difference
between male and female, but in 30 levels I never figured out how to tell gender on
an amphibian, in fact I suspect that they all switch genders on demand like those
weird african frogs that were such a crucial plot point in Jurassic Park.

Also, I found it irritating that there seemed to be nothing special about frogloks;
most races have some small advantage of one sort or another, but frogloks, bah,
might as well be "generic".    Go to all the trouble of adding in a new race, I
expect more from you than that.  Didn't even bother making a new starting zone and
set of newbie areas for them, kicked the Trolls out instead!

Actually I might consider a froglok wizard sometime, because the one cool thing
about frogloks is the casting animation.  Warrior did it only on procs, of course,
any other froglok model would have been a better choice for me.

Defeat, 30 froglok warrior, retired and deleted
