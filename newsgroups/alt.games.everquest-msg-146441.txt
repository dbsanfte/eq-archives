I had this spell in my bank since around level 48,
being one of the major rewards for leveling up that
I was looking forward to.  I know, I'm a sick
puppy, wanting such a useless spell.  I used it
too, used it a lot.

Now that its actually Functional instead of just Fun,
I have guildmates higher than 54 level who never
bothered getting the spell.

So, anyone know where the darn thing drops?  My
dream of a 6 cleric group is going to be crushed if
they are missing half their damage production!

ps note that the pet damage works even for sit
and med clerics; stand, cast pet, resume situps.
