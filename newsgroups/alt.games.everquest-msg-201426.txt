I just killed the AC and got the ring.  Before I continue with the
JBoots quest I want to make sure of how I do the turn in.

I read a lot about how the turn in works on a multi-quest.  One person
turns in the ring, then the other turns in the rapier and the money.

My question is, if I am not multi-questing, can I turn all of the
items in at the same time, or do I need to give them to Hasten one at
a time?

After what I went through to get the ring, I don't want to screw this
up on the turn in.

Thanks in advance,
