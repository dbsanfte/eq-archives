But they certainly don't like the same kind of argument being
applied to Israli victims. 

Israel has a very large army relative to it's population,
especially if you include reservists. Do nightclub
bouncers in Israel tend to be armed. If so then the same
the same stupid argument which justifies killing civilians
living in a house where a terrorist *suspect* *might* live
just as easily works for the patrons of a nightclub getting
blown up. If anyone in there is armed or connected with 
the army.

The argument of those who support Israel is that
any armed Palestinian is a "terrorist". A argument
they would never make against the Israeli population.
Are all US citizens potential terrorists because of
the second ammendment? What about the Swiss? 

Is it not just possible that a proportion of armed
Palestinians are doing so purly to protect themselves
or that some so called "terrorists" are actually purely
defensive militiamen? 

The number of suicide bombings appears much too
low to support a conclusion that the majority of
the Palestinian population are "terrorists".
