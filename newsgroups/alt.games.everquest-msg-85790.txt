	Actually I doubt that very much.

	DAoC was hyped by the fanboys (with the tacit cooperation of Mythic) as an
EQ substitute from Day One.  That's what I have been objecting to.  I rather
expect that a great many of those who signed up for it were indeed looking for
a "fixed" EQ, value of "fixed" subjective, and were disappointed when they
didn't get it.

|Unfortunately DAoC hasn't given us that yet.

	Because they can't.  Neither can anyone else.
