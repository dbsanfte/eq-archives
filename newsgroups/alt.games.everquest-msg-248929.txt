Ok, while we're on the subject, how about:
gtg

A word of explination.  In my guild, and perhaps across most of the Drinal
server, this was accepted as "Good To Go" (or "ready", "bring it on" etc).
After some time playing, I noticed that a number of people were interpreting
this as "(I have) Got To Go" instead, and occassionally pickup groups would
wish me well on my way just as I was getting settled in for the next fight.
Now that I'm playing CoH (oh jeeze.. he mentioned that other game here), it
seems that more people are interpreting "gtg" in the latter sense, so I got
to wondering which is more prevalant.  Obviously there is no "right" or
"wrong", per say, but I was curious as to how the sides were split...
