   Of course you can.  I never said you couldn't.  What I
did imply is that if you express your opinion in the fashion
that you did at the start of this thread, I have no qualms
about making jokes about your being a witch hunter in former
life.  I find it ironic that you have no problem writing
pure vitriol, but when someone takes a jab at you, you tell
them not to do it.  Well, no matter.  I doubt if either of
us is going to change our posting styles any time soon.  I
know I certainly am not going to pay any attention to any
directives about what I can or cannot say.
