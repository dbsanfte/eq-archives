>A troubled gaming addict takes his life

This is old news now.  We know it happened.  We don't know the guy - we only
know what we've read.  
Somewhere along the way this man lost his cohesion to the real world. As far as
I can tell it appears he was assisted in this by someone who agreed to support
a fully self sufficient adult instead of telling him to get off his ass, see a
doctor and get a job. 
He didn't die because of Everquest.  He died because he felt his life was shit
and no one was there to help him.
My only suggestion?  Be nicer to everyone you see today.  Give people a break. 
The guy who "cuts you off" in traffic.  The woman who steals your parking spot.
 The kid who goes 45 miles per hour in the fast lane.  
Realize that everyone has different stresses and limits.  And, yeah, let it
carry over into the game too....
