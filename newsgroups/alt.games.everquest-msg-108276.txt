A lot of the No necro stuff comes from the very first days of EQ.
Necros were every where in the begining.  Almost more necros than
druids, if not more.   

The problem came with the so called G-UBERS.  The pets took up exp and
no one really knew how to controll pets in dungeon with bad pathing.

Hence they found away to do it with out pet classes.  The only saving
grace to the necro was that he could life tap every mob and pets were
doing tons of damage with FS daggers.  A level one could life tap
Naggy.  NERF NERF NERF.  No need for a necro.  They could no longer
life tap any mob and weapons no longer changed speed.

This went on for a while until the necros complained like crazy and
this is when they added spells to help others.  Mana dump,  better
heal spells, even a mez etc etc.

In the begining the worst class and least played was the enchanter.
Verant helped them so soon after release that no one remebers that.
