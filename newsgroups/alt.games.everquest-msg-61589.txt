They'll help with this when players themselves could solve the problem??

Geez.

Anyway, you can also try zoning in and typing /corpse.  You may get
lucky...the new change to that dungeon may just bring your corpse right to
you.  ...but don't hold your breath. :)

Yup, ask someone to levitate you and you can run over the lava hitting your
/corpse hotbutton until you grab it, then just drag it to land.  It's quite
possible that you won't be able to get onto land levitated (too low and you
can't jump while levitated) so you might have to find SOMETHING to stand on
and dump the lev after your corpse is handy.  Then get onto solid ground and
start dragging your corpse again.
