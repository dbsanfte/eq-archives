The fight with Ragefire was almost a comedy, and we all enjoyed it. One 
of the shaman said, "Who is casting slow?"  The raid leader said, "Do 
you think he'll live long enough to land it?"  I had time to cast two 
Ice Spears before he went down. It was closer to twenty seconds.

We were originally going to do it with one group. (One of the shaman was 
insisting we allow him to try to solo Ragefire, since Tiru didn't really 
need the heart anyway, but that idea got passed on.) But when we 
announced we were going, nearly three groups showed up. Average raid 
level - 63.5.   I felt rather sorry for the dragon, actually.
