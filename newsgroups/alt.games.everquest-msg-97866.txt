I wonder how well a SK/Pally duo would work? I mean, pallies can kind of
heal a bit in the early levels. And that HT/LoH combo has to be nice to
turn the tide in close fights.  And if you make them both gnomes with
rediculous names roleplaying something like the destruction of all large
races.....

Oh dear. I was afraid of this. I might actually get excited about
playing again.
