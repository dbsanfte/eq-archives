Yeah, I did NK as a young ranger.  Just watch out for the griffs, they 
hit way too hard.  The guards take more than a few hits to take out the 
griffons so keep running if you train them to the guard tower.
Good advice about wisps, you need a majic weapon to kill them, if you 
don't have one, go to the bazaar if you have luclin or check the gypsie 
camp, I think they sell some, not sure tho. Also don't just sell the 
Greater Lightstones, give them to Myrsila, she'll give you exp and a 
container (must have container slots open) that sells for around 10pp.
