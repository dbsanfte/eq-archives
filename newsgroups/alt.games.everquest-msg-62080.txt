Me and a few others from my guild gave it a shot on the way to KC last 
night...one of our druids found him when she tried to drop some foraged 
crap on the ground, and we assisted her to target it (conned 
red/indifferent to me at 55). Spells and regular melee attacks didn't 
touch it, the only thing that landed were critical hits. It hit for about 
40 (occasionally doubled for 110), and after about 20 minutes of 
fighting, it still had full health, so we gave up and headed into KC.
