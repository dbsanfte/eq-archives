Eat me, Evil One.

While Rangers are another topic entirely, Paladins and Shadow
Knights are, by design, pretty much opposite sides of the
same coin.  They share most of the same advantages and
disadvantages, and are actually so similar that I'm not
sure why Verant bothered to put them both into the game
instead of dreaming up two classes that were more different
from each other.

Moreso than any other two classes in the game, Paladins
and Shadow Knights are *very* closely matched in overall
ability (and practically identical in melee ability).

So if Paladins "suck", then so do Shadow Knights.  :-)
