People seem to be making the assumption the locked
encounters in EQ2 are there *primarily* because they
prevent kill-stealing.   IMO that's a VERY bad assumption.
Locked encounters certainly have that effect -- there's no
way around the "first to engage" rule now and no need for
a guide/GM to listen to an argument about it.

Lots of people are used to the way EQ handled mobs &
tactics.  I certainly liked being able to level-pull, or lull-pull,
or pull with FD -- and it was an *essential* ability **because
of the way the content was designed.**   I got LOTS of
XP *only* because a character in a duo was able to single
pull in some way, XP that would have been impossible to
get *in those spots (with that particular loot)* without it.

EQ2 is simply designed differently.  It has defined "group"
content.  For people used to being able to "cherry-pick"
mobs or solo effectively in a group environment EQ2
may "deny them content."   I don't see a problem. There's
plenty of solo content and lots of group content, at least up
to 20, can be successfully duo'd.   Yes, I can see the day
when a duo will bypass content simply because it's too
tough -- so what?   A duo in EQ bypassed tons of
content for the same reason.   I fought in dungeons in
EQ in groups *long* before I'd take a duo into the
same spot.   The only thing going here is that you can't
wait *too* long because of the TLC.   But I don't see
that as a bad thing either -- no farming (at least in the
same sense) exists in EQ2.
