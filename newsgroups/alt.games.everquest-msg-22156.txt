Add to this list.

Places were AE Stun will bring the house down on you:

Unrest, in the house.
Mistmoore, in the graveyard (unaware of anyplace else in MM)
City of Mist halfway back where there are ghost goos, and almost all the way
back where there are still ghosts.

I'm pretty sure you can't add more than a couple more places.

Enchanter AE stuns are GOOD, and a hell of a lot more effective and
efficient than a cleric's stun.  Cleric stuns do definitely have a place and
definitely saves mana if you have an enchanter too chickenshit to get into
the middle of a fight.  But if you have a GOOD enchanter in your group in a
zone where AE is fine (the vast majority of indoor zones) then the cleric
will most likely be needlessly spending mana on something already covered
quite well by the enchanter.  Hell, if you have lots of mana, feel free to
nuke if being a healer is something you don't have to worry too much about
(since the enchanter is keeping the damage down).  Cleric nukes aren't
stupendous but they do a DECENT amount of damage (even better than decent
against undead). :)
