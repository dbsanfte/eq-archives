Or, if you want there to be SOME trade off, create stackable gems that
buy and sell for the same price everywhere, regardless of CHA or
faction. You want to buy a 30kplat item? Fork over 30 gems worth 1k to
all venues each. They take up inventory space, but don't make you walk
like you're in bullet time.
