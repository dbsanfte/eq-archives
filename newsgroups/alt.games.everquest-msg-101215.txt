>       In order to be profitable, MindArk officials say Project

>       All these games trace their roots to Dungeons and Dragons, a

>       Now, gamers prefer a Web connection.
>       Once online, they pick an avatar such as Blyndem Denkilem - the
> digital representation of their actual self - and roam
> monster-stocked 3-D cities and forests.
>       The emerging sale of these avatars is creating disputes.
>       Last month, BlackSnow Interactive, a California-based Internet
