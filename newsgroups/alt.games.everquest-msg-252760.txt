People rarely come here and ask where the *fun* zones are for their level. 
They come here asking the fastest / best places to get experience.
The derv camps / bandit camps in the Commonlands used to be a great, fun place
to learn how to play your class and pretty good loot too.  Now true newbies can
get better loot in zones that also offer faster experience.  
I *like* POP, don't get me wrong.  But I'd be happy to get less experience and
play some other areas.  When I check LFG I see people looking for Natimbi, BOT,
LDONs and Any Planes.  I don't see anyone putting groups together for Nadox or
Seb.  
Just an observation.
