That makes a whole lot of sense actually, thanks for that point of view.
The only other thought i had about this list was the easiest epic in my mind
is the shaman.  I have a shaman friend, he did the whole epic part by
himself except for two things, the tear from hate? and the last fight and
that only took one group (3 mages, 2 Clerics, 1 Bard, and him).  The shaman
quest is all about faction so that if you get the tear from hate? and do
page turn ins from City of Mist then you just give tear to final guy, kill
him, loot body, and turn in scale.  He did all the other side quests but it
amazed me that he could have skipped them if he wanted...Black Dire we did
with a 60 sk and him and my 50 bard, but it was overkill...oh wait we did
skip the Hole part, was too much trouble.  Any counter thoughts to that, or
why would the others be easier?
