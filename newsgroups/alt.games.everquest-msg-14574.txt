while roaming around qeynos on tallon zek amidst the normal chatter in south
qeynos. this white text, the same kind as when u hail a npc and he responds,
showed up on screen
"The affected zones will be qeynos freeport The overthere Lake off ill omen
and others."
there were others named plus and actually said and others
it didnt say who said it i hailed no one and the only other Pc in zone was
over at the bank this happend on the other side closer to the inn near the
tent town near the docks. the person and the bank didnt see it and i myself
hailed no one, i know npc's sometimes chatter amongst themselves but when
that happens it says who is speaking, any ideas?
