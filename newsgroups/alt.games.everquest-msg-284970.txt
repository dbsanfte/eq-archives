They did warn not to use the extra character slots if you don't have
the premium service for those.

And it's not the first time character vanished mysteriously.  Same
thing happened over a year ago when SOE decided to marge most of the
servers so if you happened to have characters on 2 different servers
that got merged into one (ie Vazaelle and Maelin) and you had more
than 8 characters, the extra characters becomes unaccessiable untill
you delete some or move some to other servers.
