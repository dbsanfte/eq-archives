This is where analogies become tenuous.  I was using manufacturer as a
designation of an exact item, much akin to the difference between a
silver ruby veil and a plat ruby veil in your example.  Even by looking
at the label you can't tell me who actually sewed  my shirt if I haven't
made it clear the difference of my meaning.

That I was wearing a veil? yes   A plat/ruby veil?  Probably not.  Can
you tell at a glance the difference between silver, plat and velium,
especially after its been encrusted with ruby?  I would give you that
you could tell I was wearing a veil, a gem encrusted veil, even perhaps
a ruby veil of some sort, but not the exact specifics.

of our feelings about the current system in place, other than the fact
that it is the system in place.
