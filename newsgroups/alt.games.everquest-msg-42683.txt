I've got it working again, but I don't think that anything I did on my
side fixed it.  Nothing worked, then I attempted to create a character
on another server (Sullon Zek in this case) and suddenly everything
worked.  Of course this is after at least 8 hours of serious
troubleshooting and completely reconfiguring my computer several
times.  Oddly enough by the end I was back almost where I started
configuration-wise when it started working.
