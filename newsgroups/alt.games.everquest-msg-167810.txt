I have to completely agree with worrybird in every possible way.  Yes,
i doubt you would have a good experience with the Matrox card.  But
every email to eDimensional was answered in a matter of hours.  Their
support may be a bit busy this time of year and they could use a few
more heads, but I was always called back on their dime promptly with a
courteous, helpful response, both over the phone and via email.  I
dealt with someone names Charles (charles at edimensional.com) who
when I had a few questions about driver updates also referred me to a
video ed had created to help customers update their video drivers. 
(located at edimensional.com/support)  I thought this was a fabulous
idea because I could actually see step by step what to do on my
screen.  While the instruction guide may be a bit scrawny, it did tell
me all of the basics and the videos go into further detail.  I think
it's only fair to put my 2 cents in because I have nothing but good
things to say about ed and the glasses.  I've had mine for about 3
months now and would never fly without them.  seems like the general
consensus agrees with me because everywhere i have read, if you have
the right equipment people are very impressed with the glasses and
have nothing but good things to say about the support.  looks like you
may have gotten a bad apple worrybird, but I'm extremely pleased with
my purchase and the folks at e-D.
