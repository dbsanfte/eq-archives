    I doubt that most people feel this way.  The ones that do, however, are
very vocal.  It's the common story; people who are content with something

   Last that I read, this is the method that is being used in EQII.  I
think that it is indeed a reasonable compromise.  But still, I am sure that
there are those that will hate it, loudly.
