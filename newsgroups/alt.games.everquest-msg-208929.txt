    They aren't weak as soloists, not at any level. They're a bit
underpowered as a raid class, but a lot of that has to do with DoT aggro. If
that was fixed, they'd be able to put out enough DPS and contribute enough
support to be a fine class on raids.

    Well, the class has a long history of being nerfed. The lifetap nerf(s),
pet weapon nerf, 44 and 49 pet nerf, Feign Death nerf, charm nerf, and more
than a few nerfs that I'm forgetting. The biggest nerfs came during
pre-Kunark, though, when a single necromancer was more powerful than an
entire party of adventurers. Depending on your outlook, you could also call
that "balancing" instead of nerfing. ;-)
