There's still a damage cap in effect that's keeping you from hitting
for max with the staff. That cap is lower for int casters than melees
but not sure what the exact numbers are at 30th lvl. I do recall being
disappointed when my shaman was still capped at 30th lvl when using a
gatormash maul 30/70 way back when.

 For newbies, a 1st lvl int caster will only hit for a max of 13 no
matter what the weapon is (if it's at least 6 damage) while a melee
will hit for a max of 19 (each will occasionally hit for a bit more
due to str bonuses).
