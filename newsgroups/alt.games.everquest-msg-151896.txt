    I think they wanted to change the warder so it did better against
high-con mobs (hits more accurate, harder = higher ATK) but wasn't as
effective against low cons (lowered number of attacks). From the sounds of
the outcry, BSTs like to solo low blues and aren't impressed by the change.

    The current conspiracy theory is that SCM was set to non-functional
(which it is right now, by the way - it does NOTHING) so it could be nerfed
when it was restored to "working". Before that patch, it saved people a flat
12% mana on all spells. Afterwards, who knows what they'll do to it. All I
know is it's very noticeable on raids how quickly mana goes down compared to
before, and it sucks that one third of my AA points spent are currently
doing absolutely nothing for me.
