Use your debuffs! The Ro line of debuffs, imo, can really make a difference.
Just watch the agro.

I am also 56 (well, 57 as of last night), and in my group, I am responsible
for snares, debuffs, DD (get Blizzard if you don't already have it. It has
the potential to do more damage than Ice Comet), DS if we don't have a mage,
resist buffs and STR buffs. Of course, backup healing, or even main healing
if the group wants the challenge.

In groups, I am constantly at work. Try to do different things, and you will
have a lot more fun.
