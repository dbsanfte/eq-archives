I am a little confused here Black Sheep - i never once said anything to do
with justification.
Actually, if you didn't notice, i support gay pride and gay rights - well
better put - i support fairness and equality across the board for everyone!

it's not the "parade" i have a problem with - it's the media circus this has
all become and the way it is all handled.
if one group is afforded a day, then so should all.
and yes, the xmas ( i chose not to put christ in there) stuff is wrong, if
it has a religious overture to it - winter/holiday songs (rudolf etc.) are
not offensive whatsoever and add the holiday spirit, also decorations are
fine and make people feel happy and warm and just add some pleasure - asl
long as ( and i stress this point) it is non-religious. That way it is a
celebration of giving and world-wide love and care for your fellow man
(human will suffice there, this is not gonna turn into a MAN thing)

So, as i see it, we agree and i did not challenge you thoughts, ideas etc.,
but supported them.
