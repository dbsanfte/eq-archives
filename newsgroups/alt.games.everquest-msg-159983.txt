Im pretty sure it got changed not too long ago.. I used to call it "anti
train code".. when id pull in droga, if I stopped to wait for mobs (which I
had to, cuz 99% are casters) some would catch me and id end up losing almsot
my entire pull - that was a fewmonths ago.. more recently when I ae'd droga,
whatever i agrod followed, regardless of how many were already chasing me
