I bind at the LOIO zone.  This way when I gate or die, I'm close to a zone
line so I can zone in if the train comes my way or quickly run back if
things have cooled down without taking much time.  I don't bind in FV
because if I did, I'd have to get a SoW everytime I die, if not gate so to
be able to run past the spiders ... as well as take a long time getting back
to the fort and my group.  Just FYI, my character is a cleric and not a
druid.
