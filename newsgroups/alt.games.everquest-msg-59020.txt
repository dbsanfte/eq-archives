That's not a very smart move.

It just means you got lucky.
The new aggro change basically takes ANYONE on the hate list
regardless of the actual aggro they've generated who is under 40%
health and move them to the top of the hate list.

There is no way any taunter, regardless of what they do short of a
very lucky stun/mez/charm, will be able to get that mob off you unless
you're dead.

There's some pretty funky ass exploits that makes use of this aggro
pattern....

Avoid taking yourself down below 40% health unless you know there's
someone ready to chain heal you.
