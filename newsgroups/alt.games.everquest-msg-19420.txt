If you are talking about dragon raids, I don't know of any that charm. The
big problem here is FEAR. Feared players are no help (and frequently hurt,
since they cannot be healed, and your cleric may spend a ton of mana trying
to fruitlessly heal you), and fears are the primary reason that most dragon
raids fail.

Faydedar,Talendor, many in WW/ToV.

Gorenaire, many in WW/ToV...I'm pretty sure that yelinak is also a cold
user.

Trakanon, Severilous, some in WW/ToV

Hoshkar in VP, some in WW/ToV.

I'd say that fire is probably the most important. Of the 3 elemental
resists that people need, it is the most difficult to obtain (there are
several items that provide 20+ cold resist...relatively few give the same
level of fire). Cold is next most important, then poison, and then disease
(which is almost totally unimportant, due to the rarity of creatures that
use this resist type...the problem arises when you DO need it, disease
resist items are few, far between, and provide low levels of resistance).

Poison is fairly low priority, cause there are several good items to raise
the resistance, and unlike all other types, there are 2 stackable resist
spells available to buff it up with (talisman of shadoo, and DMF). Even
with meager gear, you can spell-buff your way to a 150 pretty easily.

The best resist item you can find is the froglok crown (ac12,
fire/cold+20). Either camp the king for one yourself, or buy one. 

The dragons I have fought have mostly just needed one resistance. Naggy
Vox, Faydedar and (from what I hear, I've never been), a lot of the temple
of veeshan all require magic+element. Maybe in veeshan's peak too...I don't
know much about that place.

Western waste dragons only use the one resist type (there is one near the
entrance to ToV that has a poison and disease breath attack, so there are
exceptions everywhere)...none of the ones that people normally fight have
any fear attacks (Klandicar and Sontalak may...never fought either one).
Drawback is that there is a huge cross-section of resist types here. A full
load of blue diamond (except the tiara...a froglok crown will serve better)
is really nice to have for the huge cross-section of resists it provides.
Having to swap out a half dozen pieces for every different dragon gets
tiresome with remarkable quickness.

All that being said, the best resistance you can get comes from LEVELS. A
level 60 with 100 resist will take a fraction of the damage from an AE that
a level 55 with 175 will take. If you have a dragon raid coming up, and the
choice between camping a +20 resist item, and getting a level in the
intervening time frame, the level wins every time.
