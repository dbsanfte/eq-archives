Or tell the ranger to stop being a titty arse baby and grow up.

If he doesn't want Celestial healing, fine, have it his way.. he gets NO
heals.

If im running my shaman instead of cleric, I will use torpor for heals (a
godly ratio heal, similar to celestial elixiar) the downside to it, it slows
and snares the player briefly

If somebody in my group bitched at me for using it and told me I had to use
a different heal spell, well lets just say they wouldn't be in my group
anymore...
