Had the 'scammer' done that and just backed out of the deal that would
be one thing. But the scammer from my understanding kept the car.

$3,000 for ITEMS X, Y, Z. You post the 3k.. i trade you the items..
you reneg and unpost the 3k. Now you have not only your $3,000 but the
items. If the scammer wanted to take the moral high road and not do
the deal because the seller didn't own the items.. fine... back out
they go their own seperate ways no deal, but keeping them is just
theft plain and simple.

No he doesn't.. he brokered a deal and then backed out while keeping
the items he was buying. If the platinum is in his possession or under
his control, regardless of if it resides on an EQ server, that is
fraud.

Try this analogy. You go down to Union Station and put quarters in to
a locker and put a bag of well.. anything in it. You hunt around and
find someone willing to buy that bag for $200. So you take it out of
your locker and put it into his. And when he goes to pay you, he hops
a train and leaves. Would you consider this reasonable to do?

Lets face it, the guy who did it is a crook plain and simple. The case
can be made that the guy he did it to wasn't exactly an angel
himself.. but that doesn't in any way make it right or justified.
