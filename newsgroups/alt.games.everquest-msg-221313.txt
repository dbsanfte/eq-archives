   That would really depend on that party you were with.  I would think that a
large percentage of the playerbase would peg you as being an asshole, even on
FV.  IMHO roleplaying is for fun.  If your fun is cutting into other's enjoyment
of the game, then it stops being fun and starts being griefing.  I would
recommend having an OOC conversation with your groupmates before you even enter
the dungeon to discuss the issue.  Some might like the added challenge.  Others
might decide to have their characters realize that your ogre is too dumb to take
advice from and listen to him.  Others may threaten to rape your mother if you
get them killed on purpose.  It's best to know what element you have teamed up
with in advance.
