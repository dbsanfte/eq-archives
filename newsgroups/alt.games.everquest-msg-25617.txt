    I don't really want to get into this, but this statement is not
accurate.
    If you have the legal background I inferr from your post, then you know
that possesstion of a file (regardless of copyright information within the
file) can be illegal.  Further, the method of how the file was obtained is
very relevant, since the method itself may be illegal, or in violation of a
valid contract.

    Maybe.  Depends on what, exactly that method was... and, as I said, if
you have the background I inferr, you know that.

    This is just false.  See above.
    On the subject of Copyright: Copyright is implicit regardless of
markings or registration.  All a marking does is put you on public notice.
Heck, the post I am writing now is copyrighted to me, whether or not I mark
it. Granted, I don't think a lot of people would get in an uproar about a
"pirated" newsgroup post.  Though if you did grab one of the many articles
I've written in various newsgroups, and ran it, verbatim, in, say, "Wired"
magazine, without my permission, I guarantee you that I would win in court.

    Why?  If you are beyond judgement of people who's experience you claim
to know (psychically I suppose), why would you take this step?  Unless you
believe that you may have been (or know that you were) in error?
