heh, theres TONS of people who do that. i would say most low level newbs and
have nice gear are twinked via ebay money.

not to mention all the high level char's who were bought too. thats why when
your on a raid and a level 60 necro says "How do i twitch???"

the urls arent taboo, www.ebay.com - www.playerauctions.com - its pretty
crappy that people do that, but whatever :/
