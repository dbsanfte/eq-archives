That's pretty close to my approach actually. I will heal them as much
as necessary to keep them alive, but when I have to start choosing,
they can plan on a rez rather than a heal. I can't say any stragegy or
tactic is set in stone for me. The current situation dictates that.

Does that mean I don't value the mage class? No way. It just means
that in most cases, the group's mage is more expendable than some
other classes/roles. I actually admire any mages who attain high
levels under those conditions. I'm sure it gets to be a bit of a drag
sometimes.
