That, and you're stuck in "walk" mode. Exploring can be very, very slow.
Plus, you do not begin each zone in a normal zone in point, so it's not like
you'll get a look at a zone from the usual starting point, but from
somewhere right in the middle of it. And if you accidentally zone, the
tutorial ends.

It was interesting for all of ten minutes, then I closed it and haven't
looked at it since. This was months and months and months ago.
