A lot of people are going to say, "Oh, WAR ROG ENC CLR". The classic
powergamer combo. However, maybe give a thought to:

SHD ROG SHM (WIZ | MAG)

The Shadowknight holds aggro like nobody's business, allowing the
rogue to backstab very nearly every time. Plus, good pulling
ability. Shammy can do slow/DoT/SoW/heal. Also cannibalize/regen to
keep his downtime low. The choice between wizzy and mage is gonna be
close. Both have good nukes. Wiz gives you better nukes, Mage gives
you pet and neat toys (summonned bandages can really help healer
efficiency, summoned arrows for pulling, lev rings, etc.).

SK's may get torn apart like TP in raids that are balanced for warrior
/disc defensive and CH, but in an exp grind, they're arguably the best
choice for a main tank.
