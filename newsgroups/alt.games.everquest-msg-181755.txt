Wait until you get 34th level spells and quad kite the ulthorks in EW. Great
loot and exp. Keep the ulthork tusks and turn them in to I think the Othmir
chief and get a gem of some sort worth some decent money. (my first turn in
was a Blue Diamond. Not such big news now, but this was when they were going
for about 1k a piece.) You can stay here until about 42nd level for decent
exp.
