Tribute poins are used to buy buffs from Tribute masters

Each buff lasts 10 minutes then automatically refreshes
and deducts its point cost from your total.

So, for example:

My mage turns in an Architect's Scepter (LDoN 13/21
1hb, recommended level 60) for 24k points.

He then turns on Aura of Clarity to level 5 (the 
highest) and gets FT5 from it.  This is just like worn
FT - it stacks with all spells, and other FT up to
the cap of 15.

10 minutes later 37 points are deducted from his total.
10 minutes later 37 points more are deducted
and so on.

My BL (with 75k not so legitimate Tribute points) had
148pts worth of buffs running today - every 10 minutes
148pts were deducted and my buffs were renewed.

These last through death, they don't take buff slots,
and normal stacking rules are in effect.

IE: If you have a Spell Haste IV item, buying Spell
Haste IV tribute buff does no good.

If you have FT 12 (like my friend) only up to level
3 of Aura of Clarity is worth anything to you.

Basically consider this a way to get effects/stats that
you'd normally get on gear, without the gear.
