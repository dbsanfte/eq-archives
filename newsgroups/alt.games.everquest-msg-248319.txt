The group doesn't get voted on like the "Big 8" groups do. However, it does 
need to be discussed by the admins in alt.config before going to control. 
Sending the control message was a total mistake by me. Thats what I get for 
following a template to try to get this started.

For those of you interested in making alt.games.coh actually work (this 
includes those of you that want the CoH OT's and cross posts to go away) 
then it has to be promoted. You have to contact your ISP and ask for 
alt.games.coh to be added to their news server. I will be sending a booster 
message shortly to try to get news servers to start adding it 
automatically.

Again, sorry for the confusion and stalling of what could be a very good 
newsgroup. I was just trying to get something started and no one else 
seemed to know how, or want to try to do.
