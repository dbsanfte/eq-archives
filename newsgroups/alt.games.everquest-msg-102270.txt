Wow! An amazing amount of, ummm... "interesting" statements on such an
old and well defined question. :-)

Well, here ya go, anyway.

Up until level 12, you have to be within five levels of each other for
both to get xp. After you reach level twelve, you can gropu with anyone
who is up to a maximum of 1.5 times your level. In the case of a level
12, you can group with up to an 18. This will hold true for the rest of
your eq career. Once you make forty, you can group with *anyone* higher
level than you for the rest of your time on that character. (Since 1.5
times 40 is 60). Note: This may go out the window when PoP is released,
but for now it's a good yardstick to go by.

As to the xp, there's a ton of factors that affect it (pets are an
excellent example), and it used to work in a horribly more complicated
way, but they've simplified it in the last year. For a basic guideline
you can look at it this way: The percentage of the xp on each kill that
you get will basically be your level divided by the total number of
levels in the party. If you are level 24, and you group up with a 22 and
a 27 for some fun, you will be getting a percentage of the xp on each
kill which is basically 24 divided by 73, or 33 percent.  The low end
party member will get 30% and the level 27 will get 37%.

As you can see, the difference isn't huge, so never be afraid to group
with somebody who's a fair bit higher level than you. They'll probably
kill stuff faster anyway, and you'll still get a decent cut of the xp
pie.
