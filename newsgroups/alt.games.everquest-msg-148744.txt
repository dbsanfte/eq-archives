Healing will do you proud up to about 20. From 21-24 will be one of the more
difficult periods of your life as a Cleric, so you'll want to get from 20-24
as quickly as time allows.

My general healing order in groups, which can vary according to predicament:

--Melee types(Warrior, Monk, Hybrid)
--INT Casters(Necro needs to let me know when and if)
--Other Healers

Also, I always rez tanks first after a wipeout, no matter how loud the
casters cry.

From 21-24 you'll want to heal your tanks after they get 1-1.5 bubbles down,
so as you don't get behind and have to spend extra time medding between
pulls to heal while they sit. You'll find, at that level, that you'll heal
about 1 bubble on non-twinked tanks of that level.

Hope that helps a bit.
