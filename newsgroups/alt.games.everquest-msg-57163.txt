Yes, let's take some examples:

First we have a level 60 ogre shadowknight who dumped all of his points
into stamina, and is wearing +30 in stamina gear, has riotous health, focus
of spirit, and aegolism on. Second we have a level 1 dark elf warrior who I
put all of his points into charisma.

OMFG, KNIGHTS HAVE MORE HP THAN WARRIORS!
