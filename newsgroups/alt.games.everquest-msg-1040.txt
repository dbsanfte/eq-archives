The same "rare" spells are available in the Great Libraries of Erudin and
Neriak.  Humans and High Elves will need to purchase these spells from one of
the three libraries, but in most cases, they can do this easily if they feel
like making the trip.  I don't think it would be profitable to carry the spells
around trying to sell them, since they're fairly bulky, and you won't be able to
sell them for a lot more than the Library charges anyway.  (At low levels, your
customers either have no money, or would usually rather save 4pp and buy the
spell themselves nextime they are close enough.  At high levels, many casters
will pre-purchase their spells at the first opportunity so that they have them
all in the bank as soon as they get high-level enough to learn them.)

For Research, you do need the appropriate tome, and the recipie books.  Both are
sold by merchants in your spellcaster's guild.  If you want to read the recipie
books, you'll need to learn the language that they are written in, which will
require the assistance of another player who knows it, or a lot of practice
points.  (You can also find the recipies on the web, but some people feel that
this is "cheating.")
