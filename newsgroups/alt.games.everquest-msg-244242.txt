Had a dev watching us raid Fennin last night (test server, a dev not a
gm), while we were clearing the way there he told me something I
didn't know - that elemental molds are balanced to drop equally across
all four elemental zones, but not equally in each one (as in, some
kinds will drop more in one zone, others in another, etc)?

Does this jive with what you guys have seen? Because we're getting a
gross disparity in certain types in PoFire.

If you did notice this... wtf is the chain!? Please tell me its not in
Air. Because its sure the fuck not in Fire.

Oh while I'm mentioning this, a note for the few of you in Uqua -
apparently the dev that was responsible for it during GoD beta left
the dev team when it went live, leaving them to try to figure out what
the hell he was doing in there to get it fixed and this is responsible
for the delay. I guess it doesn't excuse the state of the zone, but it
does explain it.

Oh and one last thing he mentioned - in his opinion ranger archery is
too strong, but he'd like to give rangers a modest bump in melee
output. Take that for what its worth.

It's kinda cool to have opportunities to talk directly to the people
responsible for making the game work. I don't think I'll ever play
mmorpgs on non-Test servers anymore.
