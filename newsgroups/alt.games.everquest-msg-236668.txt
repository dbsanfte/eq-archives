:) We refer to SK pets as WoS (Waste of Space), but really, they are not too
bad (except when blocking my f**king arrows!).  Think I parsed the 65 SK pet
at around 15-20dps (with weapons), added to the rest of the SK's dps, this
is not to bad.

In comparion to another 'bad' pet, the 61 shaman pet (True Spirit), parses
at around 30dps in alpha mode with melee.
