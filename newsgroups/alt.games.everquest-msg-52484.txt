Phrasing has changed from "Will not be reimbursed" to "may not be
reimbursed. We've got our toe in the door, and might get it back- which
is good. The problem is there is no concrete statements of when the
answer is yes, and when the answer is no. It's dependant on the whim of
the GM and personal server policy, and that's just down right annoying
and open to abuse & inconsistant intrepretation.
