  That depends on how you judge risk I guess, but in any case, this is a

  Sure, but we don't know when, which is key to the discussion.

  1) They could be quite effective on the battlefield.
  2) They are proven effective tools of mass murder in cities, as you
  say.  Chemical and biological weapons do not have any such proven nor
  likely effectiveness.
  3) A chemical or biological attack will not produce the same
  *problems* that a nuclear attack will, no matter what the target.  If
  an enemy uses nuclear weapons against the US or her allies in any way,
  we will be compelled to use them on the enemy.  The result will be the
  deaths of million upon millions on both side as well as political
  messes that we cannot fathom.  The only alternative is to *not* use
  them in retaliation, which could prove even more disasterous for the
  US.

  We treat countries with a nuclear capability differently than other
  nations.

  Provided by nuclear weapons.
