I think that that had something to do with annother religion in the area
that often sacrifices baby goats in their mothers milk (boiled alive ?)
It then got generalised a bit <G>

I think there was a post about it somewhere ...

Ah here it is :
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=moses+milk+meat+group:alt.humor.best-of-usenet&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&selm=ahbou%3Dsmtp17014a32a7.wibble%40localhost&rnum=1

That will so wrap.

so for your pleasure :

For years I've imagined the conversations around the camp-fires in the
Wilderness. 40 years is a long time. For Moses it must have seemed a
*very* long time...

Moses:
 OK, like, listen up guys. God says that it's really cruel to
 boil a kid in its mother's milk, so don't do it, K?

One Of Moses's People and God's Chosen (possibly with a Welsh accent):
 How do we know if it's its mother? I got lots of goats, and
 they all look the same to me. At least, they do from the
 front.

[Hoots of laughter and derision]

Moses:
 Fair point, brother. No, stop tittering you lot. Titter ye
 not! Brother Hugh has raised a valid point and, while I'm
 obviously not Our Lord, I do have certain negotiation rights
 during this transition period from slavery to full PL/MH
 citizenship. Therefore, in deference to Brother Hugh's failing
 eyesight - Oy! I said no tittering! - I am empowered to
 interpret this particular requirement to mean that no kid
 shall be boiled in any goat's milk /in case/ it was its
 mother's.

Another One of M's P & G's C:
 What about lambs?

Moses:
 Huh? "Don't boil a lamb in goat's milk"? Why not?

AOoM'sP&G'sC:
 No, what about boiling a lamb in ewe's milk?

Hugh:
 No, Iestyn, I already told you, mine's goat's milk.

Iestyn:
 Not you, Hugh, ewe!

Hugh:
 OIC

Moses:
 When you two have quite finished...

[Hugh and Iestyn shuffle uncomfortably]

Moses:
 Right, brother Iestyn has raised a valid point. For the
 avoidance of doubt, and in a spirit of equal opportunity for
 young even-toed ruminant ungulates, thou shalt not boil a kid
 in goat's milk, nor a lamb in ewe's.

Hugh:
 I already told y...

Moses:
 Shut up, Hugh.

Hugh:
 Sorry.

Yet AOoM'sP&G'sC:
 Do we have to not boil it?

Moses:
 Sorry, Brother Dai, you lost me.

Dai:
 Do we have to not boil the lamb? Only, I don't like boiled
 lamb. Goes tough and loses all its flavour the way my wife
 does it. I'd rather not have mine oven-baked, if it's all the
 same to you.

Moses:
 Well, Brother Dai, your Bronwyn's cooking is famous throughout
 the Wilderness...

[Howls of derisive laughter]

Moses:
 ...but are you telling me that she bakes lamb with ewe's milk?

Dai:
 No, but she uses garlic butter, and that's made from milk,
 isn't it?

[Mumbles of "No, it grows in the ground, you twat!"]

Moses:
 OK, Brother Dai, fair enough. I think that we can extend the
 rules from the specific case outlined by Him to cover all
 forms of cooking lamb or kid wherever milk, or milk-derived
 produce, is used, and there is a risk that the milk or
 milk-derived produce might have come from the animal's mother.

Still AOoM'sP&G'sC:
 What if it's older?

Moses:
 Sorry, Brother Gareth, do you mean cheese, or what?

Gareth:
 No, not cheese. Cheese is made from carpet weevils, as any
 fule kno. I mean, what if it's a big sheep, or a big goat. Its
 mother might still be alive.

Moses:
 Is that likely?

[General murmurs of "Ol' Geraint's Daisy lived to be over 22 years old
before she accidentally glanced into a mirror and lased herself to
death" and similar tales of aged beasts]

Moses:
 OK, OK. No lambs or kids or ewes or rams or goats to be cooked
 in any way where the method of cooking involves milk or milk
 derivatives that have come from the same species.

ASAOoM'sP&G'sC:
 Wether!

Moses:
 It's a desert. The outlook is sunny. What's that got to do
 with the price of fish?

AYAOoM'sP&G'sC:
 I like a bit of boiled fish, me.

All:
 Shut up, Tomos!

ASAOoM'sP&G'sC:
 No, a wether is a castrated sheep, innit?

Moses:
 I never knu dat! OK, wethers too. Thank you, Brother Lloyd.

AROOoM'sP&G'sC:
 Calves. You forgot calves.

Moses:
 We haven't got any calves. I broke the golden one, and the
 rest died of BSE four years ago.

AROOoM'sP&G'sC:
 We might buy some more. 

Moses:
 Who from?

Lloyd:
 "From whom".

All:
 Shut up, Lloyd!

Tomas:
 We might encounter a band of roving cattle salesmen. You never
 know.

Moses [irritated]:
 OK, calves too, if we ever get any.

Bronwyn:
 I get my milk delivered.

[More tittering, and accusations of children looking more like the
milkman than Dai.]

Moses [testily]:
 So, it's still milk, isn't it?

Bronwyn:
 Yes, but I don't know what kind it is, do I? It could be
 goat's or ewe's or *anything*. It's just white stuff in a
 bottle to me.

Moses:
 My God, Brother Dai, whatever did you see in this woman?

Dai:
 Big tits, Mo'.

[Gales of laughter. Bronwyn hits Moses and Dai with her handbag and
storms off to her tent. Hugh follows, trying to look inconspicuous.]

Moses:
 Seriously, though, brother, the lady does have a point. How
 many of you can't tell goat's milk from ewe's milk?

[A number of hands are raised. Moses is becoming extremely irate.]

Moses:
 Right then. Brother Aaron, take a note of this. No animal, of
 any form, and regardless of age or sex, is to be cooked in any
 manner that involves milk, or milk-derived produce, regardless
 of the species that produced the milk, because it might be its
 mother's milk. Said regulation shall from hereon in apply to
 all goats, and sheep, and cows.

Lloyd:
 And deer.

Aaron [writing]:
 ...and...deer...

Iestyn:
 And antelope.

Aaron:
 ...and...antelope...

Lloyd [getting in the swing of things]:
 And gnu.

[Various "What's gnu?" "Nothing, what's gnu with you" etc.]

Aaron:
 ...and...gnu...

[Moses is almost beside himself]

Tomas:
 And chickens.

Aaron:
 ...and...chickens...

Moses:
 Noooooooo!
