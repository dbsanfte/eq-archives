Well I've got a human necro camped out in EC two kills from dinging 6, gulp.

I'm thinking that I am quite vulnerable in levels 6 and 7, when I am still
working with lvl4 spells. Whereas once I have the lvl 8 spells loaded (which
means a lvl9 pet) I'll feel a lot better about my chances against players
about the same level.

I figure that before dinging 6 I'll go buy the lvl8 spells, so that wherever
I do ding 8 (assuming I make it that far), I can instantly fire up the new
pet and whatnot. I think I have enough cash to buy them now. And I need to
get somebody to go buy Gate for me in Freeport, that vendor won't sell to
me.

So now I need someplace where I can try to PvE my way through lvls 6 and 7
in relative peace....where in western Antonica might that be, hmm....
