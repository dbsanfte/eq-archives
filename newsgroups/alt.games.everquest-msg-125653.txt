As a cleric I take AC first, mana second.  A dead cleric  with 1000 mana
is not good at all.  The cleric armor you get out of the temple of
sullesk ro is decent and has good ac till you can get thurgarden, or
planar armor.  The choice you gave below however I would go with the
ry'gorr armor.  The elites drop all kinds, I used the neck and leggs at
once point.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp
no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant
companion of your walks."
