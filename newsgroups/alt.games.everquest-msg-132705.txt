It's a 150pt "rune" type damage shield.

This means that whoever you cast it on, the next 150 points
of damage that would have hit them will simply not land.
Looked at another way, the next 150 points of damage on
them are spent chewing through the shield and not hurting them.

After they take 150 points of damage, the shield is all gone,
the buff drops, and any subsequent damage hits them as usual.

I've used it as an extra "free" 150 HP by casting it
just before I launch into a tough fight, and also to
give a groupmate a few more seconds of life when they're
dropping fast and the Cleric's heal may not finish
casting in time to save them otherwise.
