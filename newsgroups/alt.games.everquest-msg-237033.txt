You've answered your own question.  Opt for choice #1.  You are *not* a *high
level*.  If you suddenly get his 50+ character you still won't *be* a 50+
character.  If you insist on playing *him* I would suggest soloing.  If you
must group, let your groupmates know the truth, (they'll probably figure it out
quickly anyway).
