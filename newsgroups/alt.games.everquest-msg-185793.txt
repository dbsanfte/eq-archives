My grandfather, two aunts, and my great uncle (who was living with us
and I got to carry all 85 pounds of what was left of him to the car
for his last trip to the hospital) have all died from cancer.  On top
of that I have a friend that has lost BOTH of her breasts and her
ovaries to cancer.

I don't find the name particularly offensive.
