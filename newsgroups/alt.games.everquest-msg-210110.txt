Right...and not just hybrids: there used to be a 10% penalty for Wizards,
Mages, Enchanters, and Necromancers.  That went away when the hybrid
penalty went away.

The implementation was to give the people with a penalty an XP bonus on
awarded XP.  So, my Wizard requires more XP to complete a given level than,
say, a Cleric of the same race.  However, whenever we kill something, after
my share is calculated, my share is multiplied by 1.1, to compensate for the
penalty.

At the same time they did this, they changed the way XP was split in groups
to be based on level, rather than on XP.  The had two effects.  (1) it made
it so that grouping was effective over a larger level range, and (2) it made
it so that having people with XP penalties (racial or class) in your group
did not share their penalties with the group.
