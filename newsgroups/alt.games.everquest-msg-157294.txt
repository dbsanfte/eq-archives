There are 5 cycles for rares in SK. Each of them contain the possibility for the
Quill PH...

<<Snip>> The rest of that thought really didn't impress anything on me more than
just a bit of frustration...

Ok, so I was wrong, I will mention part of the snip... I said I wouldn't give up
Quill's ph, not that I wouldn't help with zone cycles...

Firstly, the 5 cycles have alot to do with locations, for someone without a
tracker, and there's a random ph put in place sometimes that will halt some or
all of them, so...

    I don't have a loc, but I know the area well... on the line from the cent
village towards the Nostrolo well, about halfway in between and quite a bit
towards the river is an area where all of the pathed critters in SK eventually
will walk, This is an easy spot to go to to waste stuff if a cycle pauses...
also the same holds true for the area around the chicken tree. Remember: any
quest mob, named mob or particularly 'different' mob is on one of the cycles,
but not inclusive of the rest. I say that because sometimes things will happen
like having a cent charger *shaman totemic quest mob* pop inside the cent
village, which means that ya gotta take him out to get that cycle going again.
FYI, in each of the 5 cycles there is a particular mob that will PH Quillmane,
so I will avoid mention of those just because... but here's a list of most of
the other somewhat typical mobs that will trigger parts of the cycles *too many
nameds to list, so I will skip them and just list the sorta regular ones*: an
escaped splitpaw gnoll, a splitpaw gnoll, *wandering* tesch mal gnoll *he walks
south from spires past aviak tree then turns around and heads back to spires*, a
bull elephant, *wandering* treant *they meander around all over the paths* a
cyclops, an undead cyclops... there are some others if I recall, but I haven't
done sk in a few months and I don't recall them all. It may well be that some of
this was altered since JP went live too, I am not sure, but I DO know that mobs
were added to SK for JP quests, where they fit into all this is something I
don't know. It is important to note that ANY nameds up, including the werewolf
at night *who is, after all, poor Sentry Alechin when the moon comes out*, are
considered rares on one of the cycles...
    Now, put it all together and u have the basics of the cycle that got me
started on the right track: 2 escaped splitpaw gnolls, centaur charger, a bull
elephant... simple isn't it? This one tends to pop cyclops's and poor Sentry
Alechin, although the named cents tend to come out alot on it too, and have seen
a few odd ones like Gnashmaw on it too, but also... try to remember one thing:
others in SK will kill stuff too that will add to or change yer cycle if yer not
alone in the zone /shrug nothing I can do about that.

Oh, and Zinph, the only thing that holds up Grimrot is an undead gnoll named
Gnashmaw, far as I know...
