I think his point is, that it would make much better business sense if
Verant made it easier for the customer to begin paying them again
after some time away.  Whether or need he intended to play again is
beside the point, he *wants* to play again and he *wants* to pay
Verant - they should make it as easy as possible for him to do so.
