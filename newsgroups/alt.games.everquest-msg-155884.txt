The main thing I think is the stupid long spawn times of a lot of
these mobs. What's the difference between a fire beetle and a dragon?
Nothing they are just mobs. Spawn them. Let people kill them who
can kill them, kill them. What's the big deal? Mobs are mobs, items
are items. There's no difference between an orc that drops a rusty
sword and a dragon that drops uber_sword_#7. Making the dragon spawn
once a week just limits it to the people with no lives that can get on in the middle of
the day or spend hours camping and get it 'first' the rest of the people
get screwed or have to resort to the same race. These uber mobs should
spawn every 8-12 hours to give more people in more time zones/shifts
to get them.There would be no reason to have x team of anything if they
just spawned more.

Got a friend of mine that wants the white dragon scales for the
epic and has been on 10 vox raids, he either lost the roll or the scale
didn't drop. I'm sorry but that's just stupid.
