I currently have the female high elf black leather dominatrix look.

White scaled tunic
Drake Hide Leggings
Gatorscale sleeves
Kobold Hide Boots or Tboots (nobody mentioned these, they are also black
leather looking)
Polished Bone Bracers (Turns forearms black but does not always show)
Gem Encrusted Gloves (not totaly black. More of a grey lace look)

Now if they would just let mages wield whips I would be set.
