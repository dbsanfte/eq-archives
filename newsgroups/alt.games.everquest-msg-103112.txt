Easier to get, offset by the fact its now rare as hell.

ST post-sleeper is a ruined zone.   Clearing the named every 2 days is like
a job, none of the clerics get rewarded (and theres no sense in giving extra
clerics keys, when the ONLY thing your getting from there is
primal/priceless)

So those clerics have to work really hard week after week, with little or no
reward

Totally agree.

All they did was a cheap stop-gap measure - adding the uber rare scale,
which gives you an ok piece of loot at the expense of your ST key and the
super rare scale.

And its not even like Broods are worth it for risk/reward

Sontalak (affectionatly known as satan on our server) is still no pushover
(and were an ntov capable guild) and all he drops is one ST key.. maybe a
few worthless spells every few weeks...

Klandikar drops one ST key and a poxy piece of armour fit for a level 10
twink

Zland has a chance at some decent loot /cheer but overall.. the effort v
reward just doesn't seem worth it
