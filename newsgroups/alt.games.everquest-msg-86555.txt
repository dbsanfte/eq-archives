Crusader Quarg at the field of bone gate is on shaman faction (forget the
name).
You also have BroodOfKotiz (necros)
I suspect if your friend is still KOS to the crusaders (SK's) then hes KOS
to the shamans and necros too. You just have to get into the city to con
these guys. Most likely that necro that spawns in FV is on necro faction
too.
Necro faction is fixed by killing the outcast iksar mobs. Monk and shama by
the bone chip quest in fob.
I did it with my bard.... I can bank in cabilis now... and the time it took
wasnt worth it.
