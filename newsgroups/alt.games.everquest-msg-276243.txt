You underestimate the cost of doing this. Sure, it looks easy, "just add 
colors". What this translates into, in technical terms, is the 
computational/storage costs of having to maintain many more different 
textures and color cominations to display on top of the various animations, 
etc. I'm not saying it's an insurmountable cost, I'm just pointing out that 
it has a cost and when you couple this with the quality of the EQ2 graphics 
engine and the number of distinct, interactive objects, players, and 
individual NPC's in a zone, you have to make design tradeoffs somewhere that 
allow the game to run reasonably well on all desired platforms. Every game 
has to face these cost tradeoffs and a game like CoH makes different choices 
and different tradeoffs (e.g., much more customizability, but less graphic 
realism).
