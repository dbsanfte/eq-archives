Ok, this is coming from somebody who hasn't gotten there yet, so take it
with a grain of salt. But I got this information here originally and
confirmed it with a guildmate. *Allegedly* if you go to SK to the
centaur village, there stands the pair of centaurs that give out the
warrior crafted armor quest. Originally, there were only the two of
them. One is a merchant, so he will not attack. The other is blue to a
45 and gives pretty good xp. The other horsies in the barn are too low
level to dare attack you. So, (again, *allegedly*) if you can solo that
guy you could do some solo work there to try to bulldog your way through
45.
  Now for the "however" part which you knew was coming........
They added a third "brother" to the combination. I don't believe he's a
merchant either, so he may want to jump into the action and spoil your
day. If that's the case, it may *still* be possible, because he wanders
out of the barn and off into the fields for a while every so often. (Odd
path. I followed him once.) So you might still be able to manage it.
Being a monk, of course, providing FD would work on these guys, you
could probably pull them well away from the barn for singles and be in
an area where nothing else would jump you very often.
  Of course, I've only just now started playing in the areas where the
40's types play so I'm sure there are better options I don't know about.
