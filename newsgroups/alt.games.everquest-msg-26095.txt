Yes. Install EQ on your new computer and copy these to new machine
eqclient.ini (game setting)
all the char_name_#.ini (Friend/Ignore List)
all the char_name_#.opt (hotkey and social)

***and eqOptions1.opt and eqOptions2.opt if you want every one of your new
character have you "old" firend and ignore list (before the patch that make
each character have their own firend/ignore list)
