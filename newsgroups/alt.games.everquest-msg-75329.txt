ROTFLOL... yeah, believe it or not, that was the first one I tried ;) I
think part of the problem, at least for me, with XP and a Compaq is the
Quickeys keyboard. When I bought the 'puter several months ago, it came with
ME. Keyboard stuff worked fine, though mostly I only used the volumn and
sleep buttons. After installing XP, the keyboard sorta crashed and although
I got what was supposed to be the patch for it, the damn thing never has
worked right since then, including the volumn control on the keyboard.
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. (I expect that was in large
part due to my "fiddling") So now I have to manually fiddle with stuff
(properties, etc) to get it to sound like I want it to. The same level of
sound doing email is absolutely *deafening* in D2, as well as in DAoC.
(shrug) I'm by no means a computer expert, so I mainly have to ask when I'm
stumped, but I do know enough to fiddle with the volumn first ;) But thanks
for the suggestion!
