Yep. Been there, done that. My personal best is 5 hours from the time I
started actively recruiting, til the time the last copper was split. The
2 hours of recruiting included the unshrunk troll sk bopping off to neriak
for half an hour for his adventure stone, one of the players being forced
to log while he had to pick up a friend in RL, and players who needed
step-by-step instructions on how to get from Paludal to EC tunnel. The 2
hour adventure went smoothly enough other than having to bail on the first
adventure because it wouldn't let us zone in, and getting wiped twiced.
But it took an hour afterwards as the ML got disconnected for 20 mins,
various players had to truck their L60+ cleric mains in from who knows
where to give us 90%+ rezzes (at L30, who cares?), and one player got
greased by Cazel after logging back in from his L60+ cleric...

Sometimes it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.
