Whether you can see it or not, it was standard. Of course, there
weren't many major examples at the time. Diablo was one of the only
"big name" internet play games that featured persistent characters.
Faned's explanation was also partly right. They just didn't have the
infrastructure at the time to handle keeping all the info and
securities server-side. All Battle.net was at the time was a glorified
chatroom that allowed players to connect directly to play multiplayer
games. Pretty much the same thing as setting up an IP connection game,
but with a chatroom and they connected it for you.
