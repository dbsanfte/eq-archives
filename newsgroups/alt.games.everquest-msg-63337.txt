I am in the same boat... it may ship tomorrow and we will be playing after
everyone else as we won't get it till Friday or next week.  I ordered it
from SOE for the book that only came from them but I have seen the same book
offered at several online sites as a promotion.  SOE if screwing everyone
who placed any faith in them and wasted the money to pay for shipping...
