i can hit some of these...

evil vs everyone else was the case 1 year ago when i was there...
plenty of lighty guilds of different teams are aligned, you'll just have to
ask around

pvp starts at 6.....level 12 people will gank you if they get the chance,
yes

shorties is a good team....unlike evils and elves, there is no opposite to
shorties, so you won't be "overly" KOS (in my experiences, elves and evils
were the targets of pk more than shorties or humanoids)

if you and your friends are all new, then you need to decide if you're
offense or defense.....if you guys want to hunt people down and kill them,
be casters......nukes > all .......enchanters are very powerful, mages are
great, wizards are nice, necros are good....of course, you have no defense

on the other hand, if you aren't going to PK but just play "defense" then a
good setup of priest / tank / whatever would be good (in this and the caster
case, for exp as well as pvp), but if you're new to the server, you'll be
poor, and sadly there is *no* way you can make up for 4 years of
wealth......1 twink could kill endless newbies (not an exaggeration)

level is the most important thing, bank often, and don't take it
personally.....its far, far more aggravating to be killed by someone in pvp
than any pve death, just because you know there is someone on the other end
of the line who wishes you malice.....but it's a game, remember that
