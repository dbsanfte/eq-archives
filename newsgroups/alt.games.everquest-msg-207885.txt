Well, to be fair, I would really only use the stoicism at that level on 
myself, and heal the paladin with the every so crappy at that level 
greater heal.

I have said it before, and I'll still stand by it, crappy heal+slow > 
better heal, barring trememdously superior heal.

At level 44, shaman slows for 54%, cutting damage done to the paladin 
down by more than 50%.  After that slow, 300hp for 150 mana is a quite 
adequate heal, compared to mob doing full damage, and druid healing for 
425hp for 200 mana.  Couple with the fact that the paladin has a 392hp 
heal for 150 mana at level 44, which is better in mana eficiency than 
either the shaman or druid heal.

Let's say that over the course of a fight, mob does a total of 1500 
damage.  Druid heals 3 times for 1275, costing 600 mana.  Shaman slows on 
incoming, or slows to pull.  Mob does 750ish damage to paladin, shaman 
heals twice for 600.  Total mana cost 470.  At end of fight, Paladin is 
down 225hp with the druid, 150hp with the shaman.  Shaman regens his own 
mana with canni/stoicism, and has used 130 less mana than the druid.  
Both can apply the same regen spell on the paladin in order to assist in 
reducing the healing required.

At high levels, shaman slow gets better, but druid does get to add in 
mana regen on the paladin.  Druid can cast a DS, shaman has to make 
potions for that.  Druid offers excellent transportation, and evac.

There are lots of tradeoffs, and either one would work well I think.
