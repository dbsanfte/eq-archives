   Indeed, it IS a game.  Most people know that money
is Important.  They will take more things with things
that cost money.  It might not occur to them that things
in-game might have be important in a different way.
   I trust the teen-aged girls you live next door to me.
They are good kids.  I let them use my computer from time
to time.  Occasionally, I'll let them use my computer 
while I go shopping.  While I don't have any signed
Piscasso lithographs or high-end electronics in my
house, I do have several item that hold value to 
me.  I'm trusting them with all my belongs when I
leave the alone in my house.  I've never regretted
doing it.
   But they do not have my password.  They know 
better than to tip over my tv, set fire to my
couch, or let my cats out of the house.  I've
not told them not to do these things, like I say,
they are genuinely good kids.  But if they had my
password, they might decide to take a spin on 
the game they've seen me playing so often. 
And at least one of them has paid enough attention
to my gaming that she has a fairly good idea
of how the game interface works.  If she fired 
up the game, went on drinal (which, of course,
would be the default server that would be 
high-lighted), she could easily run with any
of my characters.  She's seen me do it tons of
times, and probably wouldn't think that she
was doing anything wrong.  It is, after all, 
just a game.  It would be very easy for her
to do something very horrible to any of my
characters, without realizing how serious it
might be to me, perhaps without even realizing
that it was worth mentioning to me.  
   It is just a game, but like no other game
I have played.  It's the persistence world thing,
you see.
