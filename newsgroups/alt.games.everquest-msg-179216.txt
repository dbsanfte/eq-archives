TS is a proc stun 2hb, sure it can create agro (in the old days lots of
people didn't like to use it on raids) but it isnt even 1 hundredth what
SK's agro spells are, or were

Tormax was shortly before the monk nerf, when I figured I had one more
chance to tank an "uber" mob... a full guild raid, cheal rotation on me,
fast heals etc.   I don't think it was overpowering when I was getting a
cheal land on me every 2-6 seconds (which was like half the pause we used
for warriors)

At the same time, a guild rogue with similar HP, was tanking the same things
I was.
We both had a boatload of AA's.. I use me and him for my argument, I was
ahead of him on gear (AC/HP) but he tanked mobs along the lines of what I
did.

So was I.

Monks were joint 1 puller with SK's indoors.  Behind rangers and druids
outdoors BY FAR
Monks were 3 in tanking (no paladin or SK with similar gear to me was a
worse tank, it was just a tradeoff with tankability and DPS.. and in easy
zones like FG and Velk, that choice was easily made for a monk)
Dps/scout:situational but accepted..
SK fear kiting was a better melee soloer than I was tho, sorry.   Rangers
could solo mobs I could not, and use fear kiting in certain places to solo
mobs I had NO hope in hell of

lololol..  maybe your server has a different version of EQ to mine then.

You have openly admitted in other threads the great ease at which you as a
rogue solo'd casters in Seb.  This was at a time when I couldnt solo shit in
seb, period.

Acrylia and Seb were common AE zones too.. and the exp my wizzy made in AE
groups blew anything and everything away.

Me too, where in FG I was in competition with soloing mages, bards, rangers,
in addition to the exp groups.  No different to velks...

Btw, rangers with epic solod a MILLION TIMES more effectivley than me in FG.
Guildie ranger had zero downtime between shrooms, I had many a fight where
me and the shroom were both under a bub (all it took was 1-2 of those
illusion procs, and I was close to dead)

No, im talking about normal gear at the time.  Sure it blows now, but hey
thats progression for you.
Ask an old monk in your guild/server if when they grew up, they wore
Crescent armour, Shivercrap etc.

Im sure they did.. I mean what was the alternative?   No Velious armour.. no
nTov armour..  no kunark-monk armour suit

Getting an FBSS at 49 made me "uber" back then...  from my experianced at
the time, the average level to get haste was 45-55.. and hey, I wasnt in a
big guild (or even guilded, most of the way) so dragon haste (unsellable)
wasnt an option.

So whilst the gear may be a joke now... THAT is what untwinked monks grafted
for and wore.  And that is what they couldn't solo a damn thing in.

I either got lucky in FG,  and lost <1bubs to kill a shroom (when they just
try chain casting slow) or he procd twice, and I was ending a fight either
FD, or winning with <1 bub.   Compare that to a rangers melee experiances
there.

Hey, your the class who can sense the traps too.  And with escape.. not like
a trap is a major disaster

When rogues with SoS were pulling a corpse to AHR room, and killing her with
all warders up, what was that?
