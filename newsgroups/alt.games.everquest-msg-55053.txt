The con system has always meant the xp you'd get for a mob in a way
and the level in comparison to yours. It often has nothing to do with
the abilities of the mob itself so one blue mob might be quite easy
while another blue mob is impossible alone. People somehow got the
idea that it meant difficulty, it doesn't. 

It just happens that the mobs are going to be more tending to be
toward the higher abilities and difficulty side while still blue the
higher level you get.

Exactly. Mobs are basically designed with grouping in mind the higher
you get while some keep away classes like the druid or pet classes are
able to still do okay. However, just because something is blue like
another thing is blue does not mean my 55 druid can solo it nor should
it. Verant has said that they don't want to give you total safety in
conning, all conning REALLY means is that the mob is worth X amount of
experience for the most part compared to you while not so much the
difficulty. 

A fire beetle is very easy when blue, if an othmir warrior to my 55
druid was as easy while it is blue as a fire beetle was to my level 5
druid, I'd be level 60 in 2 hours. Its a "good xp" relation for the
most part which is also indicative of level in a way. It just happens
that what was good xp to you at 5 for your level is going to be a
whole lot easier than similar xp (less actually)  at 55.

Exactly, there are class differences also as I said above. Generally
if you are a keep away class you can do blues solo, unless they have
special abilities, forever while a warrior certainly could not.

Yep. The best way to think about it is the way you do with player
characters. If your warrior is level 30 a level 25 druid is going to
be blue to you but the druid could probably kill you and could
CERTAINLY keep you from even hitting it. When a druid, necro or wiz is
an EVEN con to your warrior its no question. However, if your warrior
duels an even con warrior it could go either way. Conning with npcs,
just like with players, does not take into account abilities. Players
seem to forget that with npcs though often leading them to say some
are "miss conned" while there is really no such thing. Npcs just have
a bit higher range of abilities thant players out of the box such as
possibly doing high melee damage or having high armor class but its
still similar.
