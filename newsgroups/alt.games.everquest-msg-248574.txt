Sorry, I sometimes don't communicate well. :-(

If enough notice was given ? Say a message outside the shop
mentioning the move ? Or  the NPC mentioning something about moving
across town ?

The bus company where I live does it, sometimes with notice. Which
is why I drive a car.

I like the scenary to change from time to time. I played PnP for

never changed anything.
