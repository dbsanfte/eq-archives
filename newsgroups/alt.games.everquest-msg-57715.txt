Logged on last nite to find my character moving in super fast motion for
lack of any better description.  Not a druid nor did I have SoW cast on me
but I was literally moving like the bionic man and all the other PCs and
NPCs around me were also moving very very fast - at least that was my
perception.

I zoned into North Qeynos and asked someone at the gate if I looked any
different.  They said no.  I then ran away from them and asked him if I ran
away any faster.  He said to him, it looked like I was running in normal
speed.  Was really weird - you should have seen the bats flapping their
little wings - looked like they were ready to break off!

This guy asked me if I had been drinking (in game that is :) )  but I hadn't
so that wasn't the problem

Was ready to camp to try to correct it when I figured I would see just how
fast I was moving.  The whole reason I logged was to see if a guildmate was
on who could port me close to a city where I could buy my new spells
(apparently the sellers in the guild in Qeynos don't kill me on sight but
aren't interested in selling to my kind - narrow minded people I tell you
grrrrrrr)

So I set my watch and off I went. Kid you not  - it took me all of 11
minutes and 30 seconds RL time to get from the gate in North Qeynos to the
gate in West Freeport including zoning time (about 10 seconds per zone
crossing which is normal for my PC).  Even with SoW all the way, this should
be a 20 - 25 minute trip, yes?  Who needs porters?  hehe.  Would have been
faster but went through EK - HHP and the ramp in EK was a bit difficult I
was moving so fast and HHP was a bit confusing as well!  To get a better
sense of how quick I was moving, from the time I zoned from QH to the time I
zoned to NK, it took me less than 90 seconds to cross WK (hung right from
entrance, straight to river by Barbi village, then straight to zone line)

Anyway, got to the bank in Freeport  and camped.  Actually wished after that
I didn't as scribing the new spells I subsequently bought took forever -
should of waited but was a bit anal that somehow/somewhere a GM would tap me
on the shoulder and lay me out for taking advantage of some exploit or
something (Ya, I know - very anal of me).  But when I camped to get back to
"normal" speed (it worked by the way) , the 30 second countdown went by in
about 5 seconds so I figure I was processing everything about 5 to 6 times
faster than usual.  Very weird but very fun for a short little trip across
the continent.

So after all that, this ever happen to anyone else out there?  I've been
playing since the game came out and have never seen anything like this or
heard about it before.   Any comments?
