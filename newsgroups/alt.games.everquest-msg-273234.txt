Duh! The sound you hear is my head smacking against the wall...

I have the Everquest CD jacket on my desk.  The Neverwinter Nights CD is
sitting on top of it in no case, ready to be inserted in the computer
(though I created a dummy CD image yesterday and no longer need to do
that).  I put them there before Christmas, intending to try them both.

Last night I forgot that was two games, and was reading the CD case to
make my comments.

I will now go sulk off in a corner and see if I can find a NWN group to
ask... :-)
