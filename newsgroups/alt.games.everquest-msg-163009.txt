Yes I did paste the second part.  Didn't work the first time, but just tried
again and this time it worked.  However it just showed a Zapheus Vaanhaylen
posting an alleged email from an alleged Lead Game Master "Bruce Economy".
I have never heard of this person and when I asked earlier in this thread if
anyone else has, no one has come back and confirmed that it is a real
person.  Without some people here having at least heard of this person, I
still strongly doubt the authenticity.  Btw, he did not name the offending
GM in the first message.  I don't care to read through the 12 pages of rants
to find out.  So did he name the actual GM?  If not, then that is the big
nail in this story's coffin.
