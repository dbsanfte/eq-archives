}    They spawn fast, die quick, and there's a zone XP bonus on top of the
}dungeon bonus. ;-)

Yep, it's pretty sweet. :)

}    What tactics have you been using?

Cast pet to get a blue.  Pet gets augment, obscure, strengthen, I get that 
plus sympathetic aura, shielding, illusion: Fire Elemental.

Tashan to single pull, Tepid Deeds, let the pet hit it a few times, chaos 
flux, anarchy, repeat last two as needed.  And I still melee, because I 
can. :)  Got my 1HB up a few more points with the ol' rod of insidious. :)

Keep enstill memmed, entrance, gate, and a color in case something goes 
haywire.

}I want to get my 31 ENCH up to 34 for
}Enchant Platinum, and I want to avoid the hassles of LFG'ing all the time at
}mid levels. Do you think a 31 enchanter could hold the camp?

Hmm... 31, I dunno.  It was pretty reasonable at 34...  Better add rune 
spells to the above strategies...

}And if you get
}legs, stop camping. You can usually either trade legs for arms straight up,
}or sell the legs for enough to buy arms.

Hehe.  Well, actually, I'm wearing the legs.  They're the best ones I've 
got so far.  And the second pair's going to my little shaman twink.  And 
if I get a third pair, my guildmistress asked nice enough...

But I do turn the camp over to the next guy on the list if the AC spawns.
