Fortunately, there are a couple of exceptions. I have a maxed out 200
swimming skill, and just for kicks we were pulling the spectres in Oasis
to the shore, with me as puller. We didn't have a sow capable class with
us anyway, so I was just swimming out, hitting one, and swimming back to
shore. I was able to outswim the specs by an embarassing margin. Of
course, this isn't too surprising since you can outrun a spec without
SoW unless you're grossly overburdened.  Another example is the Golem's
in CoM. They swam slower than me (when I stupidly fell in the moat) and
I could outrun them without SoW.
   I'm trying to think of any other mobs that are that pokey, but
nothing's coming to mind.
