Usually there are two roles, healer and DoTer/nuker/buffer.  Your group will
need to tell you what you need to do.  Even if they have a cleric or shaman
they may need more assistance with healing, and even if they have buffers
and nukers they may need more assistance with that, they'll need to tell you
and you'll need to observe where the group needs help as well.  From 19-23
and 29-33 Druids and Shamans/Shamen/Shawomen/whateveryoucallthem are as
effective as a Cleric at healing.  I believe the castle is Felwithe, at the
east wall of Greater Faydark, but I could be wrong since I'm not looking at
a picture of that screen at the moment.
