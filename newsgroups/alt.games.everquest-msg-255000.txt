I disagree.  I have the application compatibility toolkit for XP to enable
alt+tabbing, I also run 2k machines for EQ.
EQW is an all round faster, more stable program than EQ, in windowed or full
screen mode.

Even now, after however many months/years of a windowed "official" EQ, I
still get crashes when switching to another session, when switching to a
browser and so on.. thats thats based on my very infrequent non-eqw
playtime.  I see from guildies not uing EQW that the crashes are frequent
when trying to switch

EQW was a fantastic program, and still continues to be a huge game
enhancement.
