Way to go Mike... your progressing well in you quest to become even more 
annoying than the rest of the eq related auction sites combined.

I look forward to the inevitable glowing service testimonials which I'm 
sure will be coming shortly, compliments of your sockpuppets of course. 
Its really the next logical step don't you think?

cheers,
