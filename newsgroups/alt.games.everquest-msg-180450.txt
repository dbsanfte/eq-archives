Actually I played EQ when it first came out but cancelled it. That was a few
years ago and I never had any problems then. So I thought I'd give it
another try with all the expansions.

Hmm..well I updated everything recently so it's not that. The other thing
is, I did actually get it to work a few days ago but then I started getting
problems. First it was crashing on the actual game load, so I reinstalled
everything. Now it's crashing on the character selection load. All I can
think is I keep getting corrupted files when it updates from the original
install.

My PC specs:

W98
Athlon 1Ghz
256 Mb RAM
Geforce 2 GTS 32Mb
Videologic Sonic Fury / Turtle Beach Voyetra
VIA KT7A mboard
