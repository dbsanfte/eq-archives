That's cool, but that translates to, "do not answer me unless you memorize
each and every patch message in its entirety, go to Verant's boards every
day, and go to all the knowledgeable fan sites every day."

Since I don't do all that I can't answer anyone's question without expecting
the occasional abuse.  Nor can I take any answer as gospel from regular
readers (including Sean).  I expect to be occasionally abused and I expect
the occasional wrong answer.  I go the other way...I'd prefer to get a wrong
answer than none at all.
