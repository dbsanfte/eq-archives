god your fucking ignorant.

your "why post in a language hardly anybody uses" was a classic, you were
already corrected on the ignorance of that comment though.

so why dont you just stfu and leave people to post in whatever fucking
language they want

my friends get yelled at if they talk in their own language in EQ, and its
cuz of ignorant fucks like you.  Scared to use their own language, for fear
of people bitching at them.. what a joke.  NOBODY is foreign on the net, cuz
it damned well doesn't belong to anybody

instead of asking why people post here in different languages, why don't you
start telling us where it says they can't, or why they can't?!
