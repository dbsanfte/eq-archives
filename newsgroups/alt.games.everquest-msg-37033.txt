I hate people that dont take no for an answer, it's really frustrating,
especially when they begin to abuse you verbally if you tell them that you
can't help them.

Here's my plan to piss off these idiots:

Mr X tells you, 'Hey man, can I bum a port off you to Dreadlands please?
It's urgent.'
You tell Mr X, 'Sorry, I'm busy'
Mr X tells you, 'C'mon man don't be a prick, I really need this ride and
you're the only one around'
You tell Mr X, 'I'm really sorry man I'm busy'
Mr X tells you, 'I'll pay you!'
You tell Mr X, 'Listen to me man, I'm very busy, can you not try and find
someone else?'
Mr X tells you, 'FFS man come on take me to Dreadlands!'
Mr X begins to inspect you...
Mr X begins to inspect you...
Mr X begins to inspect you...
Mr X begins to inspect you...
Mr X begins to inspect you...
Mr X begins to inspect you...
You tell Mr X, 'Please stop that'
Mr X tells you, 'Make me!'
Mr X begins to inspect you...
Mr X begins to inspect you...
Mr X begins to inspect you...
Mr X begins to inspect you...
Mr X begins to inspect you...
You tell Mr X, 'Ok I'll take you if you stop bugging me'
Mr X tells you, 'Finally!!!'
You invite Mr X to join your group
Mr X joins the group
You begin to cast a spell
You create a mystic portal
Mr X creates a mystic portal

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
Welcome to Toxxulia Forest

Mr X tells the group, 'Hey asshole I said Dreadlands! What are you trying to
pull?'
You tell the group, 'I told you I was busy, believe me now?'
Mr X has been removed from the group
You begin to cast a spell
You create a mystic portal

LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
Welcome to West Commonlands

You tell Mr B, 'Ok now where was I man?'

The moral of this story is: Don't piss off a druid cos they'll screw you if
you do :)
