Well you've practically killed a perfectly good group description, heh heh.
(no problem, that's what newsgroups are for contrary to what flamers think).

One last stake through the heart though (or not) is exp flow.

    - Melee: Rogues/Bard melee squad can outdamage those necro pets.  It's a
team of 3 Rogues, 1 Bard, necro pet and shaman pet vs. 5 necro pets.  5-on-5
with rogues being better than the pets, bard debatable, necro pet even and
shaman pet worse.  --We've covered taunt-off's.--
    -Spells: 5-man necro team all has DoT's.  Those _can_ outdamage if done
right.  Each necro would have to pick a different, stackable one.  Educate
me here: are there 5 stackables that necros have?  (be honest.  No
earlier-series, no cancelled-by-same-type ones).  Now add no strong
debuff's.  Necro's get that dusk at 8ish (my necro never made it past 8) but
their series is worse than Shaman's because sha's are best-in-game.  What
would be percentage of resists to those DoT's (again, be honest) considering
fighting _blood_ reds.
    - Downtime: probably none at all.  If a pet happens to die that necro
would just not dot for a while.  The Druid, though, may be the bottleneck.
Bard would pull faster and better than a druid because of his speed and
would never have to med.  Would Druid using group regen, pack sow and having
to give up medding for pulls have any downtime with necro's feeding?
    - (last) Level: Sub bard for Ranger and original group is ready to go at
lv. 8. (no backstab till 12 but good melee anyway).  Above group would have
various levels that this can work on but not that early.  8 for necros to
fear kite, no problem, but druid would have downtime...
