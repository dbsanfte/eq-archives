Note which zone youre (he's) in when you die. Do a /loc (haver it hotkeyed)
when you die.
Now go and retrieve body. If youre nice to others you should be able to get
help if you need it.

At 7tth level you get 24 hours online (1 week offline) to retrieve your
corpse before it decays.
There *will* be worse things that happen.
Quitters never win, winners never quit.
