: I've got two questions:
: 1. What equipment do others with warriors recommend I should have at
: level 45 (weapons and/or armor)?

Get a haste item. swings=agro, agro=good.  Maybe get a proccing
weapon of some sort also.  I have a 57war and he's still wearing
his crafted pauldrons. :)

: 2. What is the relationship between the damage that a weapon's
: description says it can do (11 in the case of my Claw) and the damage
: that I actually do with it (sometimes hitting for 40 or so, albeit
: rarely).

Ok, take the dmg (say 11) multiply by 2 and add the dmg bonus that
now shows up on the weapon right click info and that's you modal dmg.
EQ RNG is such that the modal dmg is pretty damn near the same as your
average dmg.  Take that number and divide by the 0.1*delay for your
average dmg/sec.  That simple analysis should hold you in 99% of the
situations you'd get into. (1)

K
(1) the other 1% involves looking at the best minimum dmg/sec rate for
mobs with uber silly high amounts of AC and/or level above you.
