Great idea and one I've already tried (is how I got to 65 is LDON).
However, it's not easy to get groups these days with current-equip'd
characters.  Some of them have made comments about it, nothing snide
or even direct but loosely aimed for sure.  And I feel guilty knowing
that I'm hindering the group if for no other reason than my str is
crap (comapritively) due to gear.  I'd like to get some upgrades first
so I can at least feel as though I'm holding my own.
