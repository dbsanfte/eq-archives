Why should i quit out just because he wants a heal? *that* impinges on 
my playtime.

I probably get a skewed viewpoint of soloing as a cleric. I cant tank 
most things that other classes can tank, and my pet is a wimp [ever 
tried playing fetch with a hammer?] so i tend to do the root/nuke thing 
if it is alive, or the root and dot if it is undead. I try not to get 
into situations i cant handle [even though sh!t does happen, and i have 
seen some serious training going on in some zones] and rarely /y though 
i will head for a zoneline, or root and faithstone to freeport [i tend 
to bind where i am hunting, in a safe area away from where i am actually 
hunting]
aru
seriously looking for an ornate leg mold on Sol Ro, so i can get a mana 
free pet. *Only* frimping class that has to recast the pet every time 
because it suicides after the mob dies....and we cant even reclaim it 
just before it dies=(
