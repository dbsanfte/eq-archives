I would wager this probably has much to do with it. Much of a Blizzard
fan as I am, what I've seen of WoW is it's just kinda small. Many of my
friends, with a few exceptions, are already growing weary of it; though
almost all of them would sooner go back to paper-n-dice gaming than so
much as glance at any SOE titles. EQ still provides the most content of
the MMO's, except maybe for UO but then you might as well run a
Crossfire server of your own and get the same experience but on a
server you control. Possibly with better graphics. Or just play Ultima
III and forego all those other pesky players.

I would wager this is the second biggest thing. Between the world size
and quantity of available activities, EQ comes closer the variety of
play possibilities found in paper-n-pencil gaming.

I see 1337 $p34xx @11 7h3 phr34k3n9 +!m3, not to mention sentances
missing things like conjunctions, punctuation, and other critical
elements of syntax in EQ.
"Any want go WOS?" "PC X-item" "Want go dungn pls".
And the flame wars that erupt almost nightly.
No, it's defenitely not the people. Unless other servers than
Luclin-Veeshan have more literate and considerate constituents.

I'm pretty sure you were right with world size and quantity of content.
