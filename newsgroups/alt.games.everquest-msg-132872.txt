No, you're right.  This is the message that you usually get when you die after
being unconsious.   Cannibalize and light falling damage are just the few
remaining ways to get unconsious without dying outright, at higher levels.

As you go up in levels, getting knocked unconsious becomes extremely,
extremely rare...  since the amount of damage over your max that you can
survive does not scale very well with the amount that mobs hit you for.    I
doubt the limit ever gets much more than 20 hp... and when things are hitting
for 150 or 250 max, thats a pretty small window.

The last time I died to "Pain and suffering" was several months ago.  But I
remember it because it was so odd the way it happened.   We were fighting
Velketor the Sorceror, (actually camping from him, since he was aggro'ed
early) and the numbers just kind of worked out perfectly.  I was knocked
unconsious not once, not twice, but three times in a row... then killed by
Pain and Suffering, not Velk.    With defensive on, he was landing two blows
at a time for 440 damage each... and I had one druid healing me with Nature's
Touch (880 healing) each time.
