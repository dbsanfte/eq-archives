    Tweaking Gamma won't let me see invisible stuff. A lot of high-end
raiders have been complaining about the lack of Faerune (Enduring Breath,
See Invis, and Ultravision focus) on top-end items. Now those that
complained can shut up and go grind out the AA's if it's so important to
them.

    It does also allow you to CR in watery places without needing the spell
/ a second EB item, but there's so few watery places that this isn't very
impressive.

    Based on what I see on EQTraders and in The Bazaar, yes. It's easier for
me to see because I know what I'm looking for, but I'd guess half or more of
the traders in The Bazaar are either selling tradeskill components or an
item that was created with tradeskills.

    I could sell you a 34/28 2HS with 100 HP/MANA/END, 30 points of resists,
10 STR/AGI for 11000 pp. It's made with tradeskills, and does more DPS than
any other 2HS in The Bazaar. Interested in tradeskills now? ;-)

    This one is going to see extensive testing. On a multiple item combine,
do all the items get saved, or just a few? How are the saved items
determined if it's only a few?

    Will be interesting to see where this sends you. I'm sure people who
went KOS in their home cities won't be pleased about the factioning that
lies ahead! Should save melees a fair amount of coin in Gate necklaces and
the like.

    Was 305/355 for INT/WIS. With five levels, and five levels of this AA,
you'd get another 50 points on top of that.

    Prior to this you couldn't - 500 was the absolute cap. Furthermore, if a
mob's AE has a negative adjustment, that adjustment is taken off the lesser
of your actual total score or 500. So if you had 575 points of FR from
buffs, items, etc. you'd never get any benefit from the last 75 points. With
this AA, you can.

    Buffs and debuffs.

    This is the first +END regen effect in the game, so it's pretty nifty.
People that use discs all the time run into all sorts of low END issues.

    If you have all the levels of melee crit AA's, you crit a lot more than
2% of the time.

    "By how much" is something to be parsed - people found the percentages
listed for the original defensive AA's were nothing like the net effect on
damage taken. "At what cost" will be found out later in the beta,
presumably - right now all the OoW AA's cost 1 point each.

    We all figure this is a typo (copied from the regen AA) and will be
nerfed. Adding a maximum of 25 points of FT to people whose max mana regen
was in the neighbourhood of 100 prior to this seems very much off, even if
you have to have items that can get you another 25 FT first. I'm guessing
it'll be knocked down to 1 point per rank. If not, I'll buy this first off
right up to my current FT amount (I'm at 32 FT last time I checked).

    The 33% increase in FT mana regen turns out to be about a 5% increase in
overall mana regeneration for the average raid-buffed character. Are those
numbers closer? ;-)

    If this is like the last level of healing crits, it'll be by about 2%
per rank. So an "adept" thing. I'll be very disappointed if they don't put
the exact amount in the description, as they did for all previous Gift-type
AA's.

    It's a tradeskill, more or less. People make 55-60 spells to sell in The
Bazaar, since nobody kills the mobs that drop those spells any more.

    Illusions from things like the Guise last as long as the spell, which
isn't long at all - 36 minutes. This is the equivalent of the enchanter
"illusion never drops" AA for rogues.

    Yes.

    Varies by mob. This is for warriors that want to dual wield for the
aggro but don't want to take the extra ripostes and get killed for it. Slow
PRI one-handers like the Darkblade of the Warlord were the first step, this
is the second.

    They've always been tight-lipped with percentages on DPS-crit AA's. No
idea why, maybe so they can nerf them down if they prove to be too much?

    Dual wielding was supposed to be an advantage over having a two hander.
Makes sense - after all, you need to camp twice the drops to fill out a dual
wielder versus someone using a two hander. Recently warriors and other dual
wielders complained that this wasn't the case, that a two hander was usually
a better choice of weapon. These AA's are attempting to get rid of some of
the limitations of dual wielding.
