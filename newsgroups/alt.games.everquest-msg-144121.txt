Think he means SOW but...

Not a waste, it has saved my ugly butt several times. Most recently
when darkness knocked off sow and I was taking 400 points of damage
per round, darkness faded and hit soc and half a second later im the
fastest thing in the zone untill I zoned that is ). Now no other spell
would have worked so its always memed when soloing. Several times
while soloing Ive lost sow/wf due to dispells now soc can get you to a
zone or far enough away to cast better. Think of it as kind of a
druids DA )
