Ah, striping is RAID 0, I'm not ragging on your spelling, I should have
caught your meaning.  I've yet to figure out many uses for RAID 0 (1 or 5,
sure...but honestly, neither for home).  I don't personally know of anyone
either using RAID of any sort or multi-processors so I won't even hazard a
guess on compatibility, sorry!

You get some sort of message in Event Viewer, probably through
Watson...what's it say?

But making babies is usually more fun than EQ so gofer it. ;)
