Here is my response to this i was bound at the stone bridge area in karrana
all guards were friendly towards me. I died near paw and popped at stone
bridge area. Suddenly i was attacked by a gnome and all guards preceded to
attack and kill me about 2 times before i turned off my computer and
relogged as another char and petitioned that i couldnt get on to give other
char permission to drag corpse or anything. Turns out that there is a
watchmen gnome that wanders tower area and i i was kos to watchmen (you know
halv). When i bound myself all was good but stuck in death loop with no
escape. So that is just one way that it can happen. I was totaly unaware of
any watchmen even in karrana.
