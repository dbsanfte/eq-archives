I loved to do that! I used to run from Halas to Kaladim at 5th level,
and then back (usually at 9th level). I'd turn in 4 to 6 stacks of
bone chips, then run back to Halas. I was actually disappointed when
those NPC's started porting people across the OOT. I felt I was pretty
damn cool that I could get across the continent at 5th level. (High
Hold and Kithicor were the toughest to cross.) I think it's not nearly
as fun now. The world feels smaller.

I think the best solution would have been to place NPC's at the wizard
spires and druid rings to port people for a charge, to keep the ubers
happy.
