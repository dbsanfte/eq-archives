Unless they changed the numbers in the last few months, faction goes like
this:

    ( -oo, -751 ]       scowling
    [ -750, -501 ]      threatening
    [ -500, -101 ]      dubious
    [ -100, -1 ]        apprehensive
    [ 0, 99 ]           indifferent

Killing the common low level mobs generally only gives 1 point of faction.
So, if you went from threatening to dubious right away, you probably started
just a little below -500, and so are around -300 now.  200 more for
apprehensive, and another 100 for indifferent (which is when the Paineel
guards will give you a key, I think).
