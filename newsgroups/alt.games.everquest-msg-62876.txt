I'll bet you forgot to put at least one training point into
the Wind skill.

So,  you ask, how are you getting the Aquatic Ayre to work at all
without any Wind ability?  Because it also works just fine (i.e., you
can breathe underwater) if you have no wind instrument
equipped and you simply sing it.  That's probably what you've
been doing without realizing it, since you have "no" Wind skill
at all yet, until you put one training point into it.

In fact, having a wind instrument equipped doesn't increase
the effectiveness of the Aquatic Ayre at all.  So why is it
a wind song instead of a singing song?  Probably so that it
can be used as an effective Wind trainer, since it's the first
"continuous" song you get with the Wind skill.
