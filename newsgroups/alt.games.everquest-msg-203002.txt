I'm gonna have to concede that me and you are just completely different kinds
of players Crash and that's fine.  Your above statement is so incredibly insane
to me I can't even begin to explain it to you.  Dedicated ground pounders?? 
Did you make sure they didn't have a sow on too because you might miss out on
some of the scenery along the way if they did.  That's crazy.  Are you a
masochist?
