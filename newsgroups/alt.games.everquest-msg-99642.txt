You are so comparatively more intelligent yet you can't argue your opinion
without making more 'facts' up as you go along, being sarcastic and
insulting people's intelligence.

Can your comparative intelligence see how I (And probably others) see you?

your eyes don't go. Where you eyes don't go a part of you is hovering. It's
a nightmare that you'll never be discovering. You're free to come and go, or
talk like Curtis Blow but there's a pair of eyes in back of you head.
