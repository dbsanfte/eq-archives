Yep. And once again, I'll remind those of you that forget, that a lot of
us are in guilds that will *never* fight in ToV North, Sleepers, Temple
of the Uber Snake Buttkicker, or whathaveyou. And there's very little in
the game for an MA in a guild like that which will deliver the taunt and
the ratio. 80% of the playerbase still looks at the warrior epic as a
damned fine MA weapon. At least one of the one handers, anyway. Yeah,
there's a couple things in DN and such that we might be able to get too,
but the epic is right up there.

Mind you, I'm not doing the epic, but we have MA types in our guild that
are. If I'm not going to get crap for the scale in terms of money, I'll
save it for the next young warrior who breaks 55 without getting a Naggy
or Rage/Talendor drop.
 
> it probably is worth it :p

"Worth it" is, of course, a relative term. If it's enough money to make
a *significant* impact on my bankroll, and position me to be able to
afford some serious equipment upgrade for my wizard, (item with effect
ID3 or more FT for example) or to afford a spell for the upcoming levels
that I know I'll pay through the nose for (e.g. sunstrike) then I'd
definitely do it. 

Less than 10K wouldn't meet those qualifications in my book. Close, but
it just doesn't feel like a good deal. If prices bounce back up, I think
I'd jump on something around 15K. But not ten.
