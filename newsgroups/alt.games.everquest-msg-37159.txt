Its a known EK problem, at least to players. I've had it happen on the
quest npcs for the langseax also. Its funny, they spawn under the hill
and frostbite will then just stand there forever tracking them under
it (where they are stuck) spazzing until something kills frostbite.

Its something verant should fix but maybe they can't easily, like
they'd have to rebuild the zone. Really they should implement player
like code.. if a player is underground they are moved to the safe spot
should do the same for mobs.
