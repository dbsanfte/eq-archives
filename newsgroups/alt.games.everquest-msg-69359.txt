I for one is in agreement that the game has been ruined.  I have been
searching for a Voodoo2 driver that supports Directx 8 and have been
unsuccessful.  I find it wrong to force people to spend big $$$ to upgrade
their system to play a game that we are already dishing out money monthly to
play.  I for one am tempted to tell Sony i want my money back !!!!.

Get off of the SPAM crap.  Stay on the point.  Sony has created a game that
now requires its players to upgrade systems that are not that old.
