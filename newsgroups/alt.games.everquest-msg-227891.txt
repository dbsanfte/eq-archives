First off - PoI is empty because (with few exceptions) it's crap
xp for the effort expended.  The majority of the mobs near the zone
in are <55 and don't provide the High Con Bonus.

2nd - There are things in PoD/PoN you can easily take with the 
Mage/Shaman combo - stick with that instead of Mage/Druid as you 
will *need* slow.  A 61 airpet can tank slowed mobs in these zones
fairly easily.  However, about half the bugs near the castle in
PoD will still not give you the HCB (they are 55 and 56 - the 55
ones are >5 levels under you).  And only moving to the Wraiths/
Goblins in PoN will get you the HCB.

3rd - for all of these single pulling isn't a given - and you can
die fast with an add.

4th - Grouping in PoV will give you vastly more XP than any of the
options above.  Golems, Fiends and Beasts are all >60th and give
excellent xp.

5th - there are many see invis beasties in PoV - Skellies in forest,
and some crystal spiders (to name two).  The mobs in the castles
in PoV are generally not KoS (there's a merchant in one) and the
armor suits tend not to be.
