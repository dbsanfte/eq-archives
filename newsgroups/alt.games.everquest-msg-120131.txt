I am dual weilding.  But I have a lute that works in Primary slot, and
allows me to keep my secondary slot filled.

This is a massive improvement over the normal "two hander
that goes in secondary slot" approach, as you might imagine.

I keep the lute on my cursor, and hover over my primary slot hotkey,
watch the song casting bar, and click to swap in lute just before the
song hits, then click again quickly to put weapon back

Compare to a normal lute where you:

Click primary to get primary weapon
Click inventory slot to swap with lute,
Click secondary to swap lute for secondary weapon
Click secondary to swap secondary back for lute
Click inventory to get weapon
Click primary slot to put weapon back

Lute of the Howler also works this way I hear, but I'm using the
little newbie quest instrument for Vah Shir, a quest I did just
for the fun of it, and imagine my joy on discovering what a
fantastic toy it resulted in!
