June, 2005, maybe.  I doubt we'll see EQ2 this year.

Generally, I would say that GoD offers this for those not level 65 and
pretty-well equipped (i.e. those whose GoD experience will *most likely* be
confined to Abysmal Sea and Natimbi):
1. Tradeskills - Abysmal Sea is a nice tradeskill zone (so I've heard) and
you get a new interface which eases the pain of doing the same combines
again and again.  You can select a recipe from a list and have the system
automatically pull the items from your inventory and attempt the combine.
2. Tribute - Give plat and items to your tribute master in return for the
ability to activate buff-like abilities, i.e. +150 mana, FT5, and so on.  A
nice idea, but the fact that you could only activate the buffs at you
hometown Tribute Master made it unworkable for me.  I couldn't make enough
donations to run around with the buffs up all the time and no one wanted to
hold up whatever we were about to do (i.e. LDoN mission) to let me run back
to Felwithe and activate my buffs.
3. Leadership XP - if you are the group leader, you can divert a portion of
your regular xp into leadership experience and earn points to spend on
leadership abilities, i.e. additional hp or mana regen for the group when
you are leader.
4.  FT1 necklace - there is an FT1 neck item that can be gotten in Natimbi.
I'm not sure if it's a straight drop or a turn-in from collecting other
drops.

The GoD instances currently don't scale, although I read something recently
that the instanced zones may adjust somewhat if there is no warrior in the
group (i.e. a knight is tanking.  Currently, it seems a given that knights
can't tanked the named mobs in the Sewers).  I'm not sure if I read this
directly from an SOE employee or someone else passing along a conversation
from FF.

The 61+ Mage pets have gotten a significant boost in mitigation,
particularly Rathe's Son (65 earth) when summoned with a focus item (i.e.
Diamond Prism of Companionship from Tak LDoN or better).  I keep meaning to
log on and see how the new pets do against some of the old mobs that tore
them up (I remember a fetid skunk in Mischief put a whooping on old
Jabober), but I now seem to be one of the people who don't play, but reads
about other people playing. ;=)
