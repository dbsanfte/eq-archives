I have a level 18 rogue and was wanting to start my   Apply Posion skill.  I
read that there was a merchant in WK..Gindlin Toxfodder, that sold ready to
use poisons, however, when I went to WK and found where he normally spawns,
he was not there.  Has anyone any information on where I might be able to go
to get posions, until i am level 20 and can make them myself.

Thanks

Iamyeni
