A GM told me, however, that they cannot give an XP res if your res timer has
expired.  If that is still true (assuming it ever was, rather than that GM
just trying to blow me off or being an idiot), then won't a 10-12 hour wait
be a problem?

My petition was not for a bug that caused death, but rather for a bug in the
res timer.  I died, and it took a while to find a Cleric friend to come and
res me.  I kept careful track of the online and offline time (verified
afterwards by my logs), and I should have had about 15 minutes left when my
friend tried to res me, but it said the timer was expired.  I petitioned,
and that is when the GM told me that it didn't matter, because he did not
have power to do an XP res after the timer expired.
