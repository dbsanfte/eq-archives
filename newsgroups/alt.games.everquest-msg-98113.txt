Thats true, but I mean as in do all exp pak like that.  Why give a exp pak
mainly to high lvl players?  To me thats not fair, kinda says they don't
care much for low-mid lvl players.  High lvls have SoV, they have TONS of
zones as is, the have the Planes all to themselves.  How about zones that
only low-mid can enter?  Not everyone has the time to get a high lvl
character that fast, maybe they work a lot, or choose not to play 24/7.  My
highest is a lvl 15, would be higher since I've played since Phase 3, BUT
decided I didn't want to play all the time, and I play other games, plus
have a girlfriend I spend time with.  Why not give players like me something
more, yeah low-mid have TONS of zones too but why keep giving to high lvls?
