This is quite posible with the system that was posted.  ( not sure if it is
corect, just that it could be done with a lot of work)

If you where at the -751 point and you but in 2000 points then you could get
to 1249 more than enough to be ally.

Now if your base had been -801 you would never beable to become ally, no
mater how hard you tried.

At that point if you where the most hated of creatures to a sertain faction
(-2800) you would never beable to raise it above KOS  you would still be:
(-800)  scowls at you, ready to attack.
