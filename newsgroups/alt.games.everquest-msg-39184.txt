OK, at what point in EQ do you *need* ShowEQ to be effective?  Maybe
at the highest levels, PoM, ToV, ST, but probably not much before
that.  Will he realize he *needs* ShowAO at somepoint shortly after
it's available?
On a side note, how is the info in ShowEQ displayed?  Text,
radar-screen, overview map, something else?
