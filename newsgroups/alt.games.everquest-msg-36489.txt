Yeah, but...  In my view, there's even *more* reason to stick
around to assist after a pick-up raid gone bad.

With a guild-led raid, there's at least some justification for
people to assume that the guild itself is taking care of the various
responsibilities, and perhaps the "spare" people aren't needed.

But in a pick-up raid, if the various participants don't
carry the load, who will?

I had no illusions *before* that, either.

They can't kiss a Barbarian without a stepladder?

Oh, yeah, that reminds me, I took a screenshot of that:
   http://www.firstnethou.com/dcd/images/EQ000074.jpg
And according to the timestamp on the file, that was a taken
a full hour after Vox had gone on her rampage, and a lot of
the corpses had already been cleared out.  It's still a pretty
impressive pile.

/blush

Thanks much, though, so far I'm not having any luck getting
books from Nagafen or Vox, I may well have to do it the hard
way by leveling up and going after the Kunark dragons someday.
