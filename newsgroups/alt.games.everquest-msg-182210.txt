nearly correct:

dot - Damage over Time spell - like sickness, poison, creeping crud, etc...

kite - means (roughly) running around in such a fashion that the monsters
continue to chase you.  (you must be careful to stay close enough to keep
their attention (aggro) focused on you, but far enough away to keep from
being hit.  as you kite, you can occasionally stop to nuke or recast DOT.  )
a bad kiter, that allows aggro to be transferred to an innocent bystander,
is scorned and reviled - be careful if you try to kite to do it in a very
clear space...  I think Bards are best at it, but I hear from lots of folk
that druids are very good at it too...  my druid only ended up dead every
time, so I deleted him!  heh
