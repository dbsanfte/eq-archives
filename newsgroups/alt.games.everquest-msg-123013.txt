Not sure if you mean High Pass Hold or High Hold Keep. If the former, which
I would guess is the one you mean, I often have problems too, even with a
map. The north-south route, across the two bridges, isn't too bad but it is
that area in the centre when I want to head west from HHK that I have
trouble with and I think it is because, like several other places, the
texture of the walls is such that it is difficult to spot the gaps. Unless
you have a good memory though, those north and south ends are definitely
easier with a map, from www.eqatlas.com
