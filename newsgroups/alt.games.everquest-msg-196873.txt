Am I reading this right?  Might makes right???

Am I now involved with a game where I have to be subservent to the
more powerful elements of that game?

What is this?? Gangland America???

If I have to move aside in order to avoid pissing off some guild and
it's vengeful members I'll close my account and let Sony know just why
I have done so. This is totally unacceptable!

I DO Hope that I am reading it wrong.
