If you never heard of either Gothic game, I can only surmise you don't 
follow single player RPGs seriously, which is cool but that must be why. 
Anyone who is into them in any kind of serious way and follows what's 
available on sites such as gamespot, etc. would be aware of them. Gothic 
and Gothic II were very well recieved by single player RPG players and 
many found them to be something like Morrowind with a fair number noting 
things they thought were superior to Morrowind when it came to diversity 
among NPCs and the world seeming to be more of a living breathing place.
