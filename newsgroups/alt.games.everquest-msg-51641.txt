At your level, you're right. Sang is talking about the oober upper end game.

Root is fairly unreliable even to my 40 druid.  Gets resisted a fair amount,
only sticks full duration maybe half the time. I understand this improves
with my next root.  We'll see.

Porcupining is  viable through early 20s, but then drops off very quickly.
I gave it up around your level.  The mobs just start to hit too hard.

Snare/dot/dd kiting still works for low yellows at 40.  But there's tons o
downtime. So it works, but it's not really efficient.

Root/dot (well, I still pull with snare to make life easier) minimizes the
downtime between kills by putting some of the downtime into the kill process
itself. I'm not sure it's more efficient at 40, but it is more fun since it
feels like something is going on. It's nice to have a root with decent
damage since it can also function as a minor nuke (90pts or so) to finish
mobs off.

Quad kiting (snare mob x 4, aoe DD) is probably the most efficient at 40.
Despite getting the required aoe spell at 34, I couldn't reliably pull it
off til 36.  If you're heavily +wis twinked, you might be able to quad at
34.

The best xp, of course, is still the well-functioning group.  But those
aren't any easier to find at 40 than they are at 22.  (Why do some pullers
insist on pulling multiples right after the healer says "lom"?)
