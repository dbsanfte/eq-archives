I really can't say on the Ink of the Dark part but all Epics can be mulity
Quested by 46 and above at the next phase group with whoever has the Ink of
the dark have them turn in first then you turn in the rest of the Items.
Also Bloodsabers faction can be increased in Rath Mts Troll Guards One
either the SK or the Shaman increases Bloodsabers Faction not sure which.
