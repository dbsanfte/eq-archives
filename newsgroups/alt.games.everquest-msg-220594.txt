Never done a raid, so no opinion.

Ditto.

Like this.  Comic Sans is my preferred font, with occasional forays
into Burton's Nightmare.

Don't like this.

Don't like this.

Like this.

Absolutely hate this.  If it's non-optional, I'd be looking to shut
down /tell.

Bag - don't like.

Sense Heading - now that the compass exists, if they're going to put
it to 200 automatically they might as well just remove the skill
entirely.
