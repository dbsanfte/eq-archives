I have an Ogre SK (STR of 140) who just dinged 7.  I was using a Rusty 2H
Sword and hitting for between 16 - 21 each hit, but at 6 I switched to a 1HS
Rusty Longsword and got the biggest, heaviest shield I could find to bash
with.  I must be doing something wrong, because the best Bash I've ever
gotten was a 5 pointer.

So which is best ... 1HS and Bash/Slam, or a 2HS wep?  Opinions, everyone?
