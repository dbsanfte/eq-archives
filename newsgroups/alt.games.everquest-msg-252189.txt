   Microsoft has been a player in PC gaming for some time, starting with the
buyout of "Flight Simulator".  It's hardly that they have no expertise with
gaming, quite the contrary.  They have, for the most part of their history
in gaming, only published the highest quality games.  Unlike some other
companies (EIDOS or Ubisoft being a good example, which has a fair amount of
very risky games and dreck under their belts).
