	You only need one Monk to pull.

	If they're doing more damage than they're supposed to be doing, they'll
get nerfed.

	What's that phrase in the fine print of the weight-loss
commericals...'results not typical'?  You would be very hard-pressed to get
140 DPS out of Trueshot under the best of conditions, and you'd be just as
likely to get 30 DPS under the same conditions.

	Currently there's a lot of hype about Trueshot coming off the Safehouse,
where the Rogue twinks all have their panties in a wad because in one fight
out of twenty under ideal circumstances a Ranger might approach their damage
output.  (Fortunately Kendrick is gone, so they've been neutered.)

|I also recall those logs were pre-acrylia arrow
|and pre-Archery Mastery....

	They were probably pre-Trueshot nerf, too.

	The only results I've heard like that recently came from using the War Bow
of Rallos Zek.  That's an AoW drop.  I think there might be one guild on my
server who's killed it.  I've heard you can get similar results out of a
Primal, if you have Avatar pre-cast on you so the bow procs constantly.  I
don't expect to ever own a Primal -- aside from the RP issues making it
unlikely I'd ever get a Sleeper's key, the Sleeper was awakened on E'ci a few
weeks ago.
