You don't need 5000 mana to MGB HoV.

The way mana works for MGB is this:

- Does the character currently have the *normal* amount of mana
necessary for the spell (2500 for HoV)?
- if NO, then you can't cast it
- if YES, then it gets cast, and the mana *consumed* is the lower
number of: the current mana the character has // twice the normal mana
cost.

So if your mana pool is 4200, you can CAST mgb hov so long as your
CURRENT mana is at least 2500. You will END UP with 0 mana.

Or, to put it another way, mgb hov only actually consumes 5000 mana if
the characters HAS 5000 mana available.

(mana pres items will have their effect, of course)
