There's great off-path spot in Stonebrunt, on the east border about
1/4 of the way  from the top border.  It's a "cave" with a torch lighting it.
I think it's going to be the entrance to another zone eventually, but currently
it's blocked.  Because it's well lit, it's easy to find on your way back from the
pull.  It's a great place to heal up... nothing wanders by there, including
other players :P

On our sever, the zone is practically empty most of the time.  Usually the people that
*are* there, are hunting the gnolls near the entrance.  Some others may be trying
to do some of the quests, like the wakazashi (sp?) of the frozen skies sword quest.
We bumped into that one while we were there grinding xp and now have most of
the quest's items.  Woot!

I like Stonebrunt a lot!
