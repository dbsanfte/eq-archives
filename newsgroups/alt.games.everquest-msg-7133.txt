"Don't root as much as they used to"?
My damn earth pets have only been able to root TWICE against blue mobs since
level 12. And then don't forget about the problem of a rooting pet which
kills snare/fear combinations.

Earth pet sucks. Water rules.

All in all is the mage still a pretty powerful class. Not too good, not too
bad. Balanced with a tendency to good.
