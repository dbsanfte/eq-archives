People generally get upset when something good happens to others. A lot 
of them consider improvement to another class to be a nerf for them. 
There was a lot of fuss raised by warriors when paladins and SKs got 
warriors' defense cap. And even after that monks make a considerably 
better choice for a damage soaker
Why do you think that you are no tank? At what level do you have 1100 
ac? If I'm understanding it right, a monk with 1100 ac is a very good 
tank up to about level 55. I know at 51 I tank very decently with just 
950 ac (could be higher, but I didn't go to planes yet)
