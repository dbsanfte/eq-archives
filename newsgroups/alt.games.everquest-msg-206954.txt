Reminds me of my last trip to Grieg's End.  I was not sitting, I was not 
the lowest level person, I had cast no spells on the mobs in question 
yet, I was not closest to the mobs in question, yet somehow, they were 
regularly singling me out of the crowd, including at least once, going 
through the raid party to me in the back, past a couple of sitting folks, 
just for the pleasure of smacking me a couple times.  I had bear form 
going, others had wolf form.  I have never seen any zone where bear form 
has any effect at all on aggro, or faction.  Even in places where 
illusions are not to be used, bear form has not been a problem.
