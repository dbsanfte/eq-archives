In many cases each group has a different idea of what the Shaman
role should be in the group. Certainly you provide the primary
buffs to all meleers and you will spend a great deal of time just
trying to regain mana from that. Remember, in addition to STR,
DEX, AGI, STA, SOW/Billy... buffs includes regeneration and
usually haste (unless there is a chanter present in your group)
and these tend to be short-term buffs that you have to work to
keep up on.

At Level 16 you really arent going to have to worry about slowing
(Unless the Tank is a wimp) and certainly not debuffing, in fact,
until about L40+ (at least) you probbably shouldnt have time to
debuff if your group has decent DPS.

Beyond all of that, DOT and throw out the occasional Nuke WMP.

"Tashed" refers to the enchanter Tashishana (sp?), which is a
de-buff I believe primarily to magic resistance, i think... mebby
:) Some Shaman use "Tashed" in their macros as a general "I have
debuffed the mob" either not knowing what it means
[probbably...lol] or because they think their party members will
understand it means they debuffed... Personally I like to state
that it is an AC/STR/AGI debuff (which is what the shaman line of
debuffs is.)
