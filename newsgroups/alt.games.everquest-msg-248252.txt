Even though I do enjoy Monual's stories the single best advice for a
"newbie raider" is: *listen* to commands. Did I already said *listen* to
commands? ;) But only from those people entitled to give commands.
Usually it is the raidleader but often there are a few other. So don't
hesitate to ask questions you have. Try to start with your group or
friends there. When they don't know the answer ask in the specified chat
channel for the raid.
Especially as a cleric you are not alone on a raid. Asking other clerics
some questions doesn't seem to bad an idea in my book. Usually you have
to clear your way to the raid target. This time could and should be used
to ask questions. Not regarding the raid target and most often do *not*
/tell the raidleader but your fellow clerics.
Besides that I wish you good luck and have fun raiding. :)
