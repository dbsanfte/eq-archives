No, it takes a little thought to to figure out how to play well, then
you can stop thinking for  the most part.

There are more things in the Swamp than trees.  If the trees do not
provide the information you need do not look at the trees.  If that
isn't clear, try looking down.  There are navigable landmarks in that
zone too, they just aren't trees.

Ok, so you are saying that this would be a problem for you?  I can
acknowledge that.  On the other hand I don't /loc before death and have
yet to lose a corpse, not in SK, not in the Swamp, not in WL, EW or any
of the other zones that are not easy to navigate with precision.

Well then I am baffled cause I don't navigate via /loc and have yet to
find a place I can't get to or out of.  Maybe I am psychic.

No, you clearly misconstrue my point, but if that amuses you I can
acknowledge that as well.

Ok, now you have really missed my point which was that any game
difficult enough to provide a real challenge would never become popular
in a massive way.  Good games don't necessarily become popular  unless
your criteria for good is limited to number of boxes sold.  My belief
would run more towards the games which would provide the best gaming
rarely making it past conception stages as funding for a game with such
limited appeal would be hard to come by.  As with so much of our lives
the least common denominator resulting in the biggest bottom line is
what gets done, so with that in  mind it does appear hopeless as far as
the best games ever being developed.
