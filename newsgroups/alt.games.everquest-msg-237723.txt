Level 20's is pretty much still in the newbie realm since you can get to 20
in playing number in the hours by just following the crowds.
As for the fire pet, 49th level fire pet should be fine against ice giants,
with the over a million plat, I would assume you had the focus items, so the
pet is almost as strong as the 49 earth for hps and has a better damage
shield than you can cast. You should be sitting on a horse/lizard, casting
the simple DOT you have then nuking the ice giant down when it is at about
50 - 70% health. You should have had no troubles with this guy.
