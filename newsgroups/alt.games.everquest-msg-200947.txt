Daggerfall allowed you to buy houses, boats, and carts. The carts simply
acted as an inventory addition, or more precisely, a portable bank. The
houses were like any other building. You could enter, go up and down stairs,
etc. The main difference with EQ is that in DF you would click on a shelf or
container to open it rather than an NPC. Your house, cart, boat, etc were
all secure. Whatever you left there would remain undisturbed until you
returned. It was *very* handy to park your cart outside a dungeon both for
dumping loot and for having alternate sets of gear handy. Of course travel
in DF was not nearly so easy as EQ.

Which brings me to a point about houses in EQ2. If travel by porting will be
as simple as it is in EQ, will there even be a relevant use for a house
except as a status symbol?
