I know the feeling. I have a bank full of "this would have been nice when
I was level 10" stuff to give away. But finding a non-twink can be hard. I
also discount people who are anti-social or have stupid names which narrows
the pool further.

My level 12'ish cleric got given a fine steel flail when I had just moved
servers (ie. had nothing) and I can assure you it was incredibly welcome.
It's a big jump up from rusted and the vendor prices for FS weapons are
extremely high when you have to earn the coppers yourself.

So basically the FS weapon is a good test. If they knock it back then
they're clearly not newbies.
