I don't want to start a flame war about beserking or anything, but can
MoBs go beserk, or do something similar when near-death? And if so,
which ones?

This obviously has implications for when do do the most damage - it
they go beserk, I guess I should pull out the big hits (mana allowing)
from when they go beserk until they run. If they can't, then its not
an issue. I'm a newbie, and spend a fair bit of time looking on the
websites and newsgroups (I've just stopped lurking quietly!), but
don't recall seeing much about going beserk or into a frenzy.
