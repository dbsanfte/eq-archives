The part about getting mugged doesn't sound like a "doesn't know how to
group" thing.  It sounds like a "got to 40 without learning to travel"
thing.

There shouldn't be any *need* for level 40 people to travel together to
avoid getting mugged.  It sure wouldn't occur to me if I was in a group that
formed on Antonica and needed to go somewhere in Faydwer that I'd need to
wait around to travel as a group.  I'd just assume everyone knows how to get
there, and we'll meet up at the destination.
