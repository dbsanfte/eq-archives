Again, I tried to bring up the question of how viable researching these
spells will be as a tradeskill (or pseudo-tradeskill as rp indicated) when
most of the scrolls are already available cheap in the bazaar.  There may be
one or two spells per class that are available to charge an "arm and leg
for", but you've got a problem.  Either the research components will be
ultra-rare, in which case good luck getting them, or they won't be
ultra-rare, in which case one day you'll look in on your trader toon and see
that a number of people are offering the same spells you are for 10% of the
price.  I'm not saying this research capability is a bad thing, I'm just
saying that I don't see how it's going to be a "rolling in the dough"
proposition.
