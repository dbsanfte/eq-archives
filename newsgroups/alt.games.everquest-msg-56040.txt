Tuesday night now, problem solved
I had to call a sony representative by phone to find out that my cc number
was locked

He unlocked it and entered the billing info himself and I could play five
minutes later.

My characters are still on the Morrel Thule server though, I might have
missed the movelog to Antonius Bayle due to my account being innactive :(

BTW, the guy on the phone told me they had received applications for movelog
enough to fill 3 euro servers with, so I guess a lot of people will not move
after all...

Venomia.
