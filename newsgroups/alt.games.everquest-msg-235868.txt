So I'm enjoying messing around with a tank class for the first time, a 13
frog pally currently exploring Befallen (which is utterly deserted these
days). I twinked this guy moderately -- nothing that cost more than 50pp in
the bazaar -- and thereby accidentally created a new tactical challenge.

For a weapon I have him a Hammer of Silent Screams that Haabbes had won in
LDoN, which I couldn't give away in the bazaar for any money because it's
PAL-only and it's just not all that hot for a recommended-lvl55 weapon. Of
course Frolarg is getting little of the stat or dam benefit of the weapon,
but what he does get is its proc: a 180-point heal which processes from lvl
1.

The point of that, of course, is that having a meaningful heal ability makes
a young tank a viable soloer without tons of downtime. Frolarg has about 100
dex so the proc does go off often enough....but only when he's swinging the
hammer, naturally, and at uncontrollable intervals. Hmm....

So the question of when to run versus stay and fight gets interesting. I've
got 2 or 3 mobs on me, health bar going down....if I turn to run, no heal
procs....whereas if I keep fighting I retain the chance of getting a big
(for my level) mana-free heal and I only need one or two such procs to win
this fight, but....no guarantee of getting a proc at all....and these
bustards are stunning me too, which changes the odds....think fast, froggy!

Gets the heart racing a bit, it does. I've made the right call mostly but
made the wrong one a couple times too, including once I was 2 steps from
safety when they finished me, grrr. And no rezzers handy in these deserted
Old World zones these days, of course.

Even if I do make it to safety there is the "downtime temptation." Takes me
forever to med/heal back up from 20% health. But I have a way to get healed
up quick: go find a green mob and beat on it until I get a proc. Green mobs,
though, sometimes have friends -- or if they aren't undead, they run (I have
no root/snare of course) and that brings their friends down on my
low-on-health head. One such in West Commons somehow aggroed some named mob
I'd never seen before which was red to me, and that didn't go well....so
really I should just sit tight and med up but...gosh this is dull, and the
wife wants the computer soon, jeez it would be so easy to just whack some
passing spiderling and get that proc....
