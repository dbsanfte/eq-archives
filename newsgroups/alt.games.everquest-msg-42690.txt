I, personally, would suggest you start if possible... depending on
tradeskill you decide to follow. Some are extreamly expensive to work up
(Jewlecraft, Smithing) while others aren't quite expensive but require lots
of time and gathering (Tailoring)

with tailoring, all ya need is a sewing kit, and some patterns... and then
as yer killin use the pelts to make stuff... or use the silks from spiders
to make Swatchs... some of the stuff you could probably end up wearing for
awihle (My 24 enchanter is still wearing some raw silk *Snicker*) and some
stuff (Like a stack of 20 swatches) Can sell for 20pp or more if ya catch
the right person... that's JUST for the silk swatches... and those trivial
at a real low skill level. The thing about tailoring is it can be cheap..
but Very time consuming because you almost have to farm to get all the
materials needed to increase skill in level... so why not start as soon as
possible with all the pelts and silk your getting now? heh

Jewelcrafting and smithing will take alot of money to get up... I know of
one friend in guild that spent 10kpp getting skill from 200 to 215... not
something your gonna do at level 9 heh

But most importanlty... Read up on Skills... Go to http://www.everlore.com,
http://eq.castersrealm.com, or http://www.allakahzams.com  and read the
walkthroughs and guides... will make your choices much easier and skill
progression much smoother.

Good Luck and May Prexus watch over your Travels Young one
