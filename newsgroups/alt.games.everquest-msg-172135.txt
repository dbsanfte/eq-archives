Welcome. Take heart, once you get the hang of it and hit a few
milestones, you're gonna love it. A couple of bits of advice:

1. Never buy weapons or armor from vendors. They are way overpriced.
Try "/auction Looking to buy low end ranger gear" to find other
players who may have gear to sell. The best place to find *anything*
is the Bazaar on Luclin if you have the SoL expansion.

2. You can buy a sewing kit and make patchwork armor very cheaply
using ruined wolf skins.

3. Hunt the Hills of Qeynos near the Qeynos zone for the giant field
rat whiskers. You are right, they are a real bugger to find,
especially one with the whiskers you need, but the armor really is
pretty good for the level. It's best to spend your time levelling in
this area while you can still get xp while looking for them.

4. When you get big enough (10-ish?) you might consider venturing into
the Karanas and farming spider/spiderling silks and wolf, lion and
bear skins. High, medium and low quality skins and any of the silks
sell pretty well to those working on tailoring and even blacksmithing.
You can make some plat to get into the pieces you may still be
lacking.
