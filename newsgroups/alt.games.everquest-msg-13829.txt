My idea, and I don't see any flaw in it, is to have the client-side
mob list have a bit which indicates "Player has successfully FD'ed
against this mob".  It starts unset, and gets set when the
user (obviously) successfully FD's and that mob flips to unaggroed
status against him.  The next time the player tries to FD against
any mob, the success/fail code includes the line, "if that bit is
set, automatic failure".

Quick, easy, clean, neat, and not able to create any weird
side-effects like "oops, you actually died".

But the game *already* "recognizes that a specific player has Feigned
near them" -- it *has* to in order for FD to work at all, since the game
has to specifically de-aggro that mob against the player (if the
FD was successful).

"One FD per mob per zoning" wouldn't be "important" -- if it were,
it would be disallowed *now*.  If they changed it and a few people
hacked their client to "de-fix" it, the world wouldn't end.  Plus
the hacking would be obvious to any casual observer in-game.  Finally,
they could do what they already do with SoW and some other things --
handle it client side to save the server the extra load, *but* have
"sanity checks" server side to ring alarm bells if it has been
overridden.

Solution:  Remove bridge.  Or put an even nastier mob under the
bridge.  :-)

Um, where?  I've not seen them say that.  I *have* seen them
actually defend zone-escaping, and declare it an acceptable
tactic, without any hint of disapproval (although that was
on their official "open" forums, and the archives of those posts
have vaporized along with the forums themselves, so I can't
produce it unfortunately).

I've heard that a mob's regen kicks into insane overdrive when
no one is on its hate list (i.e., it is "unengaged").  You can
see the same thing happen when a high-hit-point mob kills the
person/group that attacking it, and you're standing at a distance
watching its health (but not too far away, or you won't get
health updates from it until you get closer to it).

Ask 20 GMs, get 20 different answers, unfortunately.
Plus a lot of answers of the form, "I have no idea, but
to be on the safe side, DON'T DO IT", even if the tactic
is a perfectly acceptable one.

And there's the rub -- there's no objective standard, it's
all judgement calls by many different people (different
players, and even different high-muckety-mucks at Verant).

That's why the "ban 'em" solution ought to be the *last*
resort, not first, and there ought to be some sort of
formal process (kinda like a court martial) to be followed
where evidence can be presented/refuted, and so on,
*before* the "final solution" (banning) is applied.  And
especially, I'd like it if internal dissent within
Verant would count for something (i.e., a committee of
X people who examine accusations of exploiting, and if
N disagree, then a warning is all that happens, it would
take a unanimous vote, or close to it, to actually ban
someone).  Right now, I get the impression if one
cranky Verant employee wants to ban you, you're gone,
end of story, no appeal, no redress.

In short, it would be nice if 1-2 years of work
couldn't be blown away by one guy spending five seconds
coming to a snap decision.

But the alternative is to have NO real guidelines to go by,
everything is a judgement call.  Hell, under the current
"whenever we feel like it" system of banning people, you can
get screwed for doing something that had previously been
decreed an exploit on some server somewhere, but you never knew
it because Verant never bothered to give a list of "things
already decreed to be exploits".

Take the Conquest example:  Verant took great pains *NOT* to
explain exactly what Conquest did that was verboten.  How many
more people are going to end up doing the same things because
they didn't understand that *that* was what got Conquest in
deep doo doo?

Here's a great cartoon on that very subject:
   http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2000-10-11

And note that this was written LAST YEAR, the cartoon is
not in response to the Conquest banning -- the problem with
Verant's "we won't tell you where the line is" policy was
a running joke even back then.

I repeat, "in one person's judgement call, not necessarily another's".
Even the support staff will disagree amongst themselves, and I'll bet 
that the Verant high-ups would disagree with the support staff.

Er, I don't count rooting/snaring as examples of "people being in
risk-free locations", although I do agree that summoning was intended
to negate the value of root/snare (but not to be a fix for pathing
bugs and other categories of "being in risk-free locations").

I still have a big problem with very concept of "we can't/won't make
the world act as we want it to, so we'll insist that you act as if it's
actually working as intended, or we'll ban  you".

To use a simplistic example, it's as if Snare were not actually
supposed to work on Undead creatures, but it did anyway.  Rather than
fix it, or shrug and say, "ok, snare Undead, enjoy", Verant instead
would say, "that's a bug, snaring Undead creatures is an exploit,
just pretend that you can't really Snare undead creatures after
all, don't cast it on the undead.  And if you do cast it on undead
by accident, go up to it so it can hit you as easily as it could
have if it were chasing you around.  Otherwise we'll ban you."

Grrr..

This is summed up well in the title of an old movie:
"The Gods Must Be Crazy".

Sigh.

But again, then, we're being asked to read Verant's mind *without* them
giving us an actual list of what they have determined is a no-no,
under penalty of losing 1-2 years worth of work in an instant if
we guess wrong.
