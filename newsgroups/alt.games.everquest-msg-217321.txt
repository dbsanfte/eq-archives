From the shadows, the mysterious devilsmalls@juno.com (Ted D.) (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Most your points were torn apart to such a degree it was unnecessary
for future people to repeat them.

>LDON is Great for casual players who have lives outside of EQ

LDoN is shit for casual players. It requires a guaranteed two and a
half hour solid timeslot with virtually no afks allowed and you
*can't* stop in the middle unless you feel like trashing your
reputation. Can't give your evening up for EQ? Forget about LDoN. LDoN
is, indeed, the worst expansion for the casual player yet. At least
PoP gave them PoK.

>
>LDON is GREAT for people who are looking for plat, or item drops

The item drops are inferior to VT (three expansions ago!) and take
longer to get. The money is good, however.

>
>LDON is GREAT for character developement.  The exp is FANTASTIC!

Hah LOL no. The experience is fantastic, up to about 55 or so. It is
inferior to all PoP planes tier 2 and up. It also comes in spurts,
with up to an hour of no exp at all per adventure, whereas PoP
experience (and Veksar and other hotspots) are a steady stream, if not
as intense.

>
>LDON cuts down the GREED and the BullSh*T aspects of the playing with
>other people

LDoN has already marked the comeback of the lootwhore who ducks out
after master looting and quarrels between all-rollers and NBGers,
things that were burning at low simmer. We're also seeing the
emergence once again of the "PoF druid", in other words characters who
will only group in the dungeon where their class armor drops. Greed is
alive and well in LDoN.

LDoN is getting old faster than any other expansion to date, and has
by far the least content, barring *perhaps* LoY. On my server last
night PoV, Tactics, and BoT were back to their old populations.

Completely irrelevant to any point you've tried to make.

Two raids in VT and most people are better equipped than you.

Thank you for displaying your ignorance for all to see. You are, of
course, utterly wrong. In every point you have tried to make.

Thanks for trying though!
