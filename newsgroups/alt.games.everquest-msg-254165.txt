> How do you create a new character without having to do that stupid tutorial?
The tutorial gives you a +5 to important stats, +10 hp, +10 mana charm, 
unless you are a serious twink you won't be able to beat that in your 
charm slot till you are in your 50s or even 60s (easier on FV, where 
there are lots more charms that aren't no drop.

For five minutes running around clicking thru conversations and tutorial 
windows, its not all that bad a deal, even for someone who wants no 
other items out of the tutorial at all.

Then you can go to the guy who sent you in and ask him to let you out, 
if you don't want to bother with killing tutorial mobs, and never have 
to go back.

Its possible to skip it by clicking tutorial off during character 
creation, but I don't see the point of doing so for 99% of the population.
