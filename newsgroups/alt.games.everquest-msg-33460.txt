What's really funny is when you call someone over to help,
start explaining it to them, and in the process of explaining it
you realize the problem because you've just made yourself
articulate a list of your assumptions -- all without the other
person having said a word.

Next time I'm just going to explain the bug to my dog and get the
same results without disturbing anyone else.
