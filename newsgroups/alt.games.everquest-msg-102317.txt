Whomever is posting all this trash about how supposedly Satanic and vile all
non-whites are.... they're trying to recruit for the White Supremacy /
neo-Nazi / "Identity" movement.

They attempt to recruit teenagers by targeting gaming groups over the
internet.  They don't care about posting way off-topic or getting flamed.
They just want to get their twisted world-view into as many impressionable
skulls as possible.
