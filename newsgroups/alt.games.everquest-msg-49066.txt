    Peg Leg's gang attacked you because you got too close to them, not
because you attacked a skeleton. They're just hateful. 8)

    I would recommend NOT doing this quest, though. As part of the quest
(when you kill Byle), you take a faction hit with Kaladim Citizens. That's
those higher-level dwarf NPCs in Butcherblock that aren't guards, like the
girls on the docks. You will NOT get that faction back, and in fact there's
no way to GET it back. The one hit will only take you to apprehensive, so
there's no worry about them killing you or anything, but it's annoying to
think the quest is so poorly designed that you lose dwarven faction doing
it. And the reward stinks. If you want a quest with a nice reward, if you've
turned in enough bone chips to the guy in the paladin's guild then another
NPC there will give you a quest for Aviak Chick Talons. That one has some
nice XP attached.
