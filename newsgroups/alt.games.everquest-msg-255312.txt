At least in the first years, I don't think EQ would have built the
playerbase it did if there had there been no Vox, Nagafen or Planes of
Fear and Hate. Most players back then dreamed about getting to a level
where they could participate in raids on these targets and it was their
enthusiasm that brought in a lot of new players. In the first year or so
of EQ, it wasn't really even heavily advertised and still had phenomenal
growth.

Making all equipment droppable would benefit the platinum sellers far
more than the player base, IMO. First, low level content higher level
guilds ignore would be farmed again, just for the plat. Anyone who was
around in the early days probably remembers the times when every good
loot dropping mob in lower guk was camped by a soloing necro or a duo
who lived there almost 24/7. This is one of the reasons no drop was put
in in the first place.
