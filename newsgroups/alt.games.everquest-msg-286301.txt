On a side note, be aware that some zones contain a mix of five-minute
and 30-second mobs.  (Note to anyone confused by the terms: these refer
to the length of time after combat before you can enter the fast-regen
state.  For "raid" mobs, it's five minutes.)  One example is the Plane
of Storms, where the giants are five-minute mobs, but the yard trash
are 30-second mobs.

The reason this matters is, your timer is based on the last thing you
kill.  So if you finish a mob and find you have a five minute cooldown
before OOC regen, try killing a trash mob and see if you can get on the
30-second timer instead.
