Put in an option for a player defined string indicating weapon
changes.

I.e.

You say "equipping long sword"
You say "equipping short sword"

and break damage out by weapon as well - when weapons are of the
same time or your logfile is huge this would be extremely useful.

Break out damage by level/skill level as well where level ups/skill ups
are shown in the logfile ;)

Woo ;)
