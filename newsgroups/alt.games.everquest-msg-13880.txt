Woot!

I got all of my factions restored!

I sent in several emails and some friends and guildmates did
as well. Finally got a hold of my servers lead GM and he restored
all of my factions to their previous pre-crash levels!

Thanks to Verant, this customer is one that is currently satisfied
with the customer service. Bummer that it had to happen in the
first place but they fixed my problem.
