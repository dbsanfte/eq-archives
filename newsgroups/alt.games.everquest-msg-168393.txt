Maybe its because I have a excellent quality GF2 Pro (Asus) and a average quality GF4 BMG. But no I
had very little lag in luclin AND PoP zones. I still use the GF2 card in my second PC. I Dual Comp a
63 necro and 63 cleric. The only time I ever have had bad lag was at raids with 35+ people, but even
the GF4 bogs on that some, though not as bad.
