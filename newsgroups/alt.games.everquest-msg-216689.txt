From the shadows, the mysterious "Persival" <hoggsdale@yahoo.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>I was thinking of this ,that it would be nice to have a "locker box" or
>"moth balls" to hold your character in.
>From what I Know you can only have your character on their data base for 3
>months after that they erase it.

They never have and probably never will.
