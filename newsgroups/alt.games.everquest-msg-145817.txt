As you can see here, damage done with this plan is significantly better
than damage from Judgement.  So no more telling me to cast a nuke
if I'm FM, thanks.  Pet plus melee and heal the wounded as needed.
With Yaulp V on, mana regeneration is nearly as good as sitting would
be, and Yaulp V drops if you sit, so it -is- an either/or.

Anyone whining about a cleric joining in as secondary melee now has
simply got a stick too far up their rectum.
