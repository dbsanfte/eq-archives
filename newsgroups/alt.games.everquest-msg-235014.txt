LOL! Your cleric is drowning, Tunare only knows what's become of your mage,
you've accidentally started the clock on the adventure, and the rest of your
party is scattered trying to find the cleric....in that context it seems
funny to me that the wizzie going LD would be the thing that makes you
really start to worry...."So Mrs. Lincoln, I understand you had some
concerns about the cleaniless of your cab home from the play...?"

Anyway that's a great story.
