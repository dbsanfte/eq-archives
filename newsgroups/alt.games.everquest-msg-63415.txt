Euh, think not. The whole point of Summon Monster is that you summon
something that's indistinguishable from the monsters in the zone (like the
fun of having a spiderling beat the crap out of a Kodiak :).

If they upgrade the effect the whole effect of terrorizing newbies would be
lost.
I still remember my first encounter with a summoned Sand Giant at the docks
of Oasis. I logged in, saw the giant and broke for a run to the zoneline
while screaming "SG AT DOCKS" (as a lvl 13 you don't take any chances).
After I zoned I had a tell from the high lvl mage pointing out my mistake
:-)
The real fun part was that 4 others had also zoned because of my shouts...
