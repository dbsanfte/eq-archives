Gratz!

To those other posters I'd like to say that levels are everything, if
what you want is to get into the elementals and raid raid raid, or
grind your life away in getting LDoN points or whatnot, I have an L65
Paladin with some 106AA (not all that much really), so I know a little
bit what the high end stuff is about.

To me it took he fun out of the game, so much that I quit EQ just a
couple-three weeks after LDoN came out.  It was too stressful.  To do
anything meaningful I'd have to be raiding in the elementals, and I
just didn't enjoy that in the end.  Of course the loot is awesome, but
it is awesome because for the most part it is needed to succeed. 
Fighting in elemental non-PoTime loot is not much different than
fighting orcs in HK in a set of crafted, the only difference is that
HK I was able to do with less than a group, while PoF takes multiple
groups (for the most part).

What I am saying is, as long as you have FUN, it REALLY doesn't matter
what your level is.  I got so fed up with people slowing raids down,
do not listen to instructions, simply doing the wrong thing at the
wrong time, etc etc, that I quit.  It just wan't worth my time to get
all upset over stuff like that, at the same time I didn't want to sit
there and raid something in 4 hours that could have easily be done in
2 hours if everyone would STFU and listen.

Anyway, bottom line is, of course higher levels get to see more zones,
and at times more challenging encounters, and at times more stupid
ones (can you say mezz-duty doing rathe?), but as long as you are
having fun with the game, you have already won.
