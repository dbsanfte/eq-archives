Don't give it another thought, derekw.  If you follow this newsgroup very
long, you'll notice that there are quite a few people here who love to make
newcomers feel unwelcome.  Dark Tyger and Bizbee are two of the most
prolific, although Bizbee usually leads off the sarcasm, Dark Tyger, Brat,
and a few others in tow.  I guess Dark Tyger is coming of age just about now

You probably posted here thinking that this was like most newsgroups where
people actually want to help new folks out.  There are, but they're often
drowned out by these louder, angrier people.  Nothing anybody can do about
it, I suppose . . .
