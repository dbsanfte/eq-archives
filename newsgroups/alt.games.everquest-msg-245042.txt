You know (feel free to Google and check this too..) weekend posting has
never been a highpoint of mine.
Originally from the days of only reading when at work, in a 9-5 mon-fri job.
Now i work from home a lot more, I have my "NG" comp always with me... but
the weekend factor doesn't change.  Im sure you don't care how i spend my
weekends.. but it typically involves shopping, socialising with friends.. or
even dare i say it, hardcore EQ sessions.  To the point that the very next
thing I do after camping in EQ is to just hit my piller at some ungodly
hour.  Its a very rare thing that I post on the NG/messageboard at
weekends.. (afterall, what would i do during quiet workdays then!)

I guess your 2 day delay in having to wait for my response is another of
your thorouly tested luker-detection methods..  well my bad, i'll be sure to
ask permission before i don't not respond to an on-going thread for a few
days in future.

Which experts would that be? Monkly-business? /laugh

You probably aren't aware, but there is another monk class board in
existance (not open access).. and the sole reason for its creation was the
state of MB.  MB could put mage message boards of 2 years ago to shame, with
the level of retarded whiney little fucks, who want to be able to slow mobs,
mend others, mitigate better than warriors, and all the rest

Sure there are some good posters on MB (namely the very people who post on
both boards)... but those posts are diluted by a thousand flaming monkies
who don't give a damn about class balance, they just want to be THE BEST

Maybe we see different people as "experts".. i mean, your method for
determining lurkers and trolls is pretty abnormal.. so im sure its no
different here too.

The monks i raid and pull with on a daily basis, the monks who play at the
highest level of the game, the people on the "elitist" other class board..
these guys are my experts. People who love their class, play it in and out
to the highest level, doing all they can to better themselves.. if you only
look for negatives, you will never see anything you like.

Chuckle.. you got called out by random non_fanboys and you are still so
bitter about it.

Because you are a fucking idiot.  You have been called out for most of your
claims here, but you still refuse to believe it.
Random people joined the argument to try and set you straight, but you are
incapable of seeing any world aside from the "Palindrome" way.

People think it because they know im not a troll, im not a lurker. I may be
abrasive and have little patience for dickheads anymore, but i talk about
things i experience day in day out. I can help a good section of people in
here/the channel, and I do just that. Im not the only one, heck im not even
the biggest or best at it, but im there a lot and i do it.

Lets see..

Ive tanked in every exp group I do.. at all levels.. I am fairly
self-sufficient.. my wife is a cleric.. i am a >10k melee class.. i 2box a
mean 350+ aa shaman.. I tanked in velk, I tanked in PoV at level 61 (the day
i got flagged, i was in there tanking) with no God/PoP aa's.. with only
velious/luclin gear..

I tanked in HoH.. I tanked in SolRo.. I tanked in the elementals the day I
got my RZ flag (wearing VT gear... zero elemental).. my usual group of
shaman+cleric+monk was suffice in PoE.  Often we grouped with other dps
friends too (or more of our own twinks).. but the core "3" (2+1) was more
than enough.

I tanked Regruas in powater, for my crab meat to make BPP. I tanked the
Regrua Overlord for my chanters kelp hilted mace.. I've tanked PoE named for
my chanters mask..

I've tanked Vallon Zek in tactics (with the almighty dps of a monk, cleric
and shamamn).. again a 2boxed shaman and my wife duo.  Most other named in
Tactics..

I've tanked BoT exp/named/tower named in 3 people (plus bots) kills..  I've
tanked PoFire elemental mold droppers (AMY), I've tanked named mobs and
guards on the Fennin Ro Tyrant of Fire script.

I've tanked Plane of Time tier 1 (water, fire, earth).. infact I do so on a
weekly basis. I've tanked Avatar of Elements (end boss of Phase 3)

I've tanked Vxed trial + named mobs.

A few of those were on a raid (amy/fennin/avatar of elements) so healing was
in abundance.. the vast majority was 1 group events (or less), so yes using
just 1 cleric.

I saw in other posts you mentioned DPS... so I just parsed an old log file
(Starting Jan. 04)
Emperor Ssraeshza, 8 melees present.  DPS = damage per second, TD = total
damage.
Me:      119.38 DPS / 103,743 TD
Rogue:  103.83DPS / 90,023 TD
Rogue:  97.88 DPS / 84,961 TD
Warrior:84.60DPS / 67,344 TD
Monk:  84.24 DPS / 73,123 TD
Ranger: 82.72 DPS / 71,549 TD
Monk:  51.22 DPS / 44,463 TD
Beast:  33.29 DPS / 28,796 TD

Skimming through my log.. lots of trash mobs (rogues mostly top spot)
Kazrok of fire, Plane of Time phase 1 named
Me:       396.50 DPS / 11,102 TD
Rogue   364.69 DPS / 9,482 TD
Rogue   218.70 DPS / 4,347 TD
Warrior 198.00 DPS / 1,980 TD
Ranger  167.67 DPS / 3521 TD

Quarm - boss of potime
Ordered by DPS: Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, Ranger, Monk, Monk, Ranger, Warrior,
Rogue
Ordered by total damage done: Monk, Ranger, Ranger, Ranger, Ranger, Monk,
Rogue

Omni Magus Crato (from FRO script)
DPS: Monk, Ranger, Warrior, Warrior, Ranger, Paladin, SK, Bard, Paladin,
Beast, Beast
Total DMG: Monk, Warrior, Ranger, Ranger, Warrior, SK, Beast, Beast

My parser just crashed.. but I could be here all day anyway. And raid
parsing really isnt 100% reliable.. its just a guide. There are big
differences between DPS and Total damage.. knowing when somebody is AFK or
going full out..

1 parse that is meaningful to the argument though (i mean as you clearly say
beast dps > monk dps)
Ikkinz trial 1+2, 2 named mobs. The whole group was fully aware of the need
to burn it down (and a disc was used by all people, each fight)

Diabolical Destroyer:
Me:    313.80 DPS / 36,715 TD
Beast 137.56 DPS / 15,407 TD
Warr: 107.71 DPS / 12,494 TD
Bst_pet 73.64DPS / 8321 TD

Even combining bst+warder, its 14k less damage than me, in a 117 second
fight.

Rav Interceptor:
Me      285.73 DPS / 33,145 TD
Beast:  145.92 DPS / 17,073 TD
Warr:    77.79 DPS / 9,102 TD
Bst_pet 58.87 DPS / 6535 TD

Combined, 9.5k less in a 117 second fight (hmm thats a big coincidence).
allow the parser a margin of error and use it just as a guide.. the story
remains the same

Gear wise, we are pretty similar. He is best hp beast serverwide however (i
only top my servers list)

Cant pull to the point we are crippled.. heh
Well, I can't really show logs to prove that one. You will just have to take
my word for it.. my fellow monks and I have pulled every mob there is to
pull in the game.

Stun immunity via a disc, innate stun resistance from behind, the best FD in
game, mend, immunity to feign break from resisted spells (and some spells
that do land) via an AA skill.. the best knowledge over the years of
pulling, pathing, tips and tricks etc..  yep, really crippled and can't
pull.

-m

ps: I didn't spell check.. so just incase.. Well, you still have an angle to
flame me..
