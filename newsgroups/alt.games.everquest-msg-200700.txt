The thing is that the group and situation you are describing is what KEI 
was meant for.  The entire group was level appropriate for level 60+ buffs.  
Where it seriously detracts from the skill level required is when it is 
cast on low level players.  It is fun as a low level player to have almost 
limitless mana, but, it seriously detracts from the skill level required to 
play.
