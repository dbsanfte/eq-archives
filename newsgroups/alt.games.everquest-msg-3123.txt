I'm a male who plays a female character mostly, and I dont try in the least
to act female. Well, I dont act like a guy either, thatd be just weird. For
some reason, everyone assumes I'm a female in real life, cant figure out
why. After being around people for a while, you can usually tell their
approximate age, and their sex, but for some reason I guess I'm hard to
figure out. Oh well. The only reason I picked a female character was because
the male high elves look goofy. /shrug
