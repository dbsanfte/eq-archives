What I don't get is why this thread degraded from an EQ Players simple
question about role-playing on other servers to this drivel.  Far too
many kids (or "adults" with the maturity of children) have more time on
their hands than they need.  Go mow lawns!  Go outside and play cops
and robbers with your little guns.  Leave the threads alone till you
know what is appropriate to post in a thread/newsgroup that clearly has
a title and a topic. It's called respect for others. ...something their
parent's didn't teach them.
