Not mistaken.  On a night of 5 deaths (relatively common for me when I'm
pulling and/or CRing), I end up the majority of a yellow "down".

I never do split, after the first, second and third patch messages that said
they screwed up exp split between AA and regular I considered myself warned. 
But it's a *lot* easier (as I said above, about twice as easy) to fill up 60
regular experience than it is to get an AA point.

Not hardly.  :)  In alternating pulls with an erudite friend at said
level-50-mob camp he makes better experience than I do, as is to be
expected.

Without any numbers, it's hard to really give anything definite.  I know at
times I've had my experience make some pretty weird jumps, like zoning and
suddenly gaining 3 or 4 blue without killing anything.  Was it a graphics
glitch, or was it an actual bug?  Who knows.
