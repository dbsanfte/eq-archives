Do you guys really charm stuff in high traffic areas?  LIke say zone
out in Sebilis.  I've taken a chanter and a cleric both past lvl 50. I
hardly ever charmed during mass battle. And when I brought my cleric
up I hardly ever saw it done.  

Maybe things would change for Enchanter if they had Dictate, but as
for regular charm, you are better off medding during fight than
running around trying to recharm a drolvarg.
