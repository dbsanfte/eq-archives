Of course D&D will offer a more intimate experience than EQ. The DM
can tailor the entire experience to you and your fellow players. EQ
has to cater to thousands.

First of all, as another poster already said, if you arent having fun,
then there is no point. As over used as this statement is, its a game.

If you have only just jumped on the leveling grind, yes, it gets dull
fast. You sound like an experienced roleplayer, have you actually ever
really tried to roleplay in EQ? Yes, it can be difficult since most
dont even try (or really even know how, or... *gasp* havent even heard
of the concept - amazing - but many playing this "roleplaying" game
have no clue as to what roleplaying is). Even on FV, the roleplaying
server, ive seen most NOT roleplaying, altho i havent spent alot of
time there. Once I started hearing the usual "/shout DING LEVEL 2" and
the oft used "/shout Can ne1 PL me?" crap I went back to my normal
server and just wrote off the roleplay server as just another server
with a different ruleset.

Many of the officers in my guild have played AD&D and hit this
particular point in the game ourselves. We decided to do something
interesting. We designed a background story for a new guild, a rather
detailed story with an evolving plot. Then, created a new guild and
moved everyone to the new guild. Unknown to the others, we created a
second new guild (just for us officers) and kept it secret. This
second "secret" guild would become the arch nemesis of our guild. We
declared a guildwar with this guild and began to roleplay it as per
the evolving story. The officers in a sense, became dungeon masters.

The concept has kind of fizzled a little due to many reasons, but I
wish it hadnt. It had tons of potential. Imagine creating quests and
goals for the guildies. Hunting in Norrath would have purpose, not
just the same old leveling grind. Each member could influence the
ongoing story and become part of something, each could contribute.

When we were actively playing the "nemesis" guild, it was loads of
fun, especially considering that the other players had no clue it was
us (many of us dual box - so we could be on our mains and our nemesis
characters). It really sparked many of the players and some of the
battles that we had were more interesting than any we had with npc
mobs. As I said, this has kind of fizzled for several reasons, but
would love to do this more. I wish I could find a guild that does this
more aggresively and more committed to it.
