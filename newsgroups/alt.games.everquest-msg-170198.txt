Greetings all.

I recently completed the Nostrolo's Tambourine quest a few weeks ago. 
Quested for all the coins myself with some help along the way. 
Getting the coin in the Overthere was the most fun.  I charmed one
Scorpikis and had him attack the Scrounger Scorpikis.  The both harm
touched EACH OTHER (never seen that happen) and the Scorpikis lost. 
The Scrounger had so little health that he was automatically fleeing. 
I put one DoT on him and he was toast.  The tambourine is awesome! At
Level 40 I can see a big difference in Selo's speed, and my percussion
DoT's.  The increase in damage output seems significant, IMO.  I am
wondering, are there other quests between the 30-50 level range that
can be done that result in a really good item?  I'm sure there are
class specific quests but I'm talking about the ones that anyone can
do that results in an item that anyone can use.  The Lambent Armor
quests were fun to do as well.  Those kind of quests seem non-existant
but I'm sure there are some out there.
