> Okay, for solo, or far better to at least get a small group together?

      Groups are safer.  It's easy to train down there, and you can't 
break camps solo without a lull or harmony effect.

      On the other hand, LGuk is still one of the heaviest-camped 
dungeons in the game.  There are always groups down there farming 
high-demand items like the Flowing Black Silk Sash and Shining Metallic 
Robes.  Plus, there is a questable mask usable by all classes and races 
that casts a wood elf illusion on the wearer.  Completing this quest 
requires high faction with the live frogs in Upper Guk, so there is 
usually some level 65 guy sweeping through the whole dungeon killing 
every undead frog and gargoyle he can find.  If you go down there during 
peak playtimes, you can roam the entire dungeon and be completely 
unmolested by mobs except for the occasional bat or spider.  Good for 
exploring or soloing, inefficient for group grinding.
