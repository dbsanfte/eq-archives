Get to Stonebrunt Mountains. If you are a porter you get to the ring or
Circle by spell, also do this if you are of low enough level you cannot
survive a run through the Warrens. If you want to go manually then you
grab the PoK book to Paineel, run through the newbie yard there, through
the Warrens and into Stonebrunt. This should take about 5 or 6 minutes
tops anyway. 

Run across Stonrbrunt tothe sea area in the SE corner of the zone. See the
big parked ship, run up to it and click on the doors into the cabin area
(visible from the gangplank). THe door click triggers zoning.
