Believe me, I'm quite grown up, and I know all about that ceiling. And
I know all about the connotations of the word in question as well.
That you don't understand why the word is objectionable is lamentable,
but entirely your own problem.

You can run around screaming "it just means wimp" all you want, but
you'll find that has no effect on reality. And, you'll also find it
has no effect on Blizzard policy.
