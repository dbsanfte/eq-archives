And for YOUR information, this is an unregulated Group, which means everyone
else can Pretty much slag you off and otherwise taunt you if they want to.

As for criminal law, I'm not aware that your request DID in fact violate any
criminal law as such - but then I'm British and no expert on US law, which I
assume would deal with any such issues.  However, it was certainly a
violation of Verant's terms for provision of the EverQuest service, and your
request might land you in some hot water with them if carried through.  Not
only you, but any poor sucker who didn't really read the ToS (who does,
after all?) and thought it would be okay and agreed to help you.
