Your loss, not mine.   :-)
I'd refuse to heal or buff anyone who felt they had the right to tell
me how to play my own character so yes you WOULD be looking for
another group quite fast, wouldn't you?  :-)

I'm only lev 32 cleric yet but I still melee a lot to keep my defence
skills up, BUT only if I have 70m or better.
Once I drop below 70m from healing people I sit and med until FOM again
before I play tank some more.

Never had and casters complain when I stun/melee drag an add off them
while the tanks are busy.  <heh>

Bash rocks!  Now I can actually do a bit more damage when I
practise tanking and it helps me draw aggro faster to save the casters.

Yeah, but I have more fun so far with my Holy Symbol of Brell that
lets me right click to summon Blessed Ale!

Woot!  What a Deity!
