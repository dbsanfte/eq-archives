Sure I could, I'd pull off a pawn and stick her in the front row. Whats 
stopping me? The laws of physics allow it... see my hand moving the pawn 
out of the way...

Oh... wait the "rules of the game" you say... well.. sure -that- would 
stop me *if* I respected them.

Check the rules in EQ, they prohibit buying swords on ebay too. So what 
makes cheating in EQ ok??

/shrug If they aren't lore I can dual wield them.

And yet you still have a shiny new sword. A sword you did not have 
before. A sword you are busy whacking mobs with. Don't be a twit.

Try using that if you are ever arrested for stealing a car. No, judge, I 
didn't steal any car, I just stole some *time* from the person who had 
worked to earn it. So these charges of "grand theft auto"... they should 
be dropped.

Obviously false.

If it doesn't affect the game in any way, why did you feel compelled to 
hand somebody 20 bucks for the sword? Oh wait... it -does- affect the 
game now doesn't it.
