A very good description, and I'm sure everyone will find an issue or
two with their class.  Here are the changes I would suggest for bards.

I would boost pet, bards get charm fairly early, and use it throughout
their career, maybe 3 or 4 here.

Bards do get primary hand damage bonus, but you are correct that we
don't get double attack.  


>Hostile Territory Travel: 5, invis, ivu, sneak

Might move this up a bit, we don't get IVU, but Selos Song of Travel
is speed, invis, see invis, and lev.  Outdoors only, but completely
rocks.  If you're indoors invis song is great, but must have flute
equip'd.  Sneak, right-click masks, and faction song add a bunch.
