Fastest one I've been in was a collection mission, low 40's group.  We had
it finished in 35 minutes.  We didn't pick up the last piece, kept on
killing, making sure we always had one piece waiting on a corpse.  At about
30 minutes to go, we picked up and got success, then wiped out the remaining
critters in the dungeon in the leftover 30 minutes.  As I recall, I got 44%
of Level 42 in that one dungeon.
