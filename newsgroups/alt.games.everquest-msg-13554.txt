Try this.  Instead of calling someone a troll for voicing an opinion you
disagree with, just put your money where your mouth is.

For those of you who believe information theft only ever happens to "other
people", there is something you can do to show your confidence in the
security of your account information.  Post to one or two hacker newsgroups
and web boards.  Get them to notice you first.  Maybe insult them a bit.
That shouldn't be hard.  Think of those people the way you think of new
posters on this newsgroup, and the insults will just come pouring out.
Question their intelligence.  Hackers just LOVE that.

Then, challenge them to take your Everquest account away from you.  I can't
guarantee the results, but if you do it and don't get your account stolen,
at least you will have a more credible argument in your repitoir than to
just chant the words "troll" and "killfile" like some kind of bizarre
mantra.

One more, only slightly related, issue.  This is for Dan Harmon and Dark
Tyger.  Surely, nobody can be right all of the time.  Yet it seems that Dan
is incapable of disagreeing with Lokari or, for that matter, of allowing
someone else to disagree with her without jumping in with insults.  Dark
Tyger has a similar relationship with Bizbee.

So here's the question.  Which one, Dan Harmon or Dark Tyger, will learn to
think and form opinions on their own first?  Don't laugh, it COULD happen.

Lokari and Bizbee may be a bit hard to take from time to time, but at least
they deserve the respect and recognition that they appear to form their own
opinions, however ill-informed some of those opinions may be.  They serve no
other master.  How long will it be, Dan Harmon and Dark Tyger, before the
same can be said of either of you?
