	What is it about the technology in a "game" server that 
makes it more "twitchy" than say, an Oracle server?

>Server problems like the recent ones are rare. 

	Yes.  However, it is a symptom.  The same problems with 
implementation and methodology that cause the relatively brief
outages 3 or 4 times a month are causing this one, and it is those
sins of omission that I question.

>get a fucking job at SOE 

	I monitor their openings daily.  I'd kill to work there, and
frankly, I know I could do nothing but make things better...

>Whining 

	I'm not whining.  I'm airing my frustrations in a public forum.

	Looked at in the grand totality perhaps.  But I'll bet you 10
severed orc feet and a rusty long sword that they've got the systems
partitioned so that no single system actually handles anything *close*
to an entire world.

>Each machine hosts SEVERAL zones. 

	Suboptimal design.  Each zone should be handled by a small anonymous
cluster, or at least one per zone and a hot spare...
