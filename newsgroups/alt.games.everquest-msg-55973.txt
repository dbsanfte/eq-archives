Might be worth PvPing for fun.  Esp if you get a caster mob.  This is the
only way I will PvP

This is very good.  I really disliked the Exp greens.  Now we know where the
exp really is.

Another good change, IMO.  Now you won't have to disband one group member to

Thank You (a bit too late for that dropped bag of wis gear...).  Sometimes
you missed the "XXX has dropped to the floor" message in zones with lot's of
activity.
