Hi Cursim, I believe from around your level (Maybe a tad higher) i was Quad
kiting in Lake of Ill omen....blues, with even cons and yellows thrown in
when i found them.  The trick to defeating the resistances at your level is
to start your "Staffe of Temperate Flux" Quest.  This staff will open up a
whole new world of quad kiting for you and will lower mobs resistances for
you.  It is perhaps a wizards most useful tool, aside from Jboots.  you will
need high level help however as at 21 you cannot get the staff solo.
