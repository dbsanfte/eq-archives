What were you hoping to make? A Leeloo outfit from the Fifth Element or 
something?

Yes, they're for bind wound, although only use them for that if you're 
making them for practice anyway - regular bandages are cheaper to buy than 
the sale value of all the spiderling silk you need for the silk ones.

Silk

None. 2 spiderling silk makes one silk thread. 3 threads would get you a 
silk cord for making bags, not bandages as you state (that's 2 threads). 
However what you need for silk armour is silk swatches not threads. They're 
made from 2 spider (not spiderLING) silks. Then combine 1 swatch with a 
pattern to make armour (2 swatches for tunic or pants patterns).
