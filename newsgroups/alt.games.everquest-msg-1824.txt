 The amount of XP received for killing a dragon or something is so
insignificant that it's not really a good use of Verants time to try and
implement anything differently. On most multi-party raids XP isn't the
motivating factor it's mostly loot. In fact most people go expecting to
lose some xp. In other words it's not broke so it doesn't really need to
be fixed.

 Oh and as for not knowing who to heal in different groups, etc.. That's
why the raidmaster tries balancing out the groups so that each one has
some type of healer. Normally you wont have to worry about someone else
in a different group.
