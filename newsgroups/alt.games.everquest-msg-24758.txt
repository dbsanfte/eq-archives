Way back before it was broken ~April 99, I did the Jaggie Pine Crook quest.
Worthless weapon, sentimental value to it since I used to to beat 100s of
wisps to death so I could finance my character. I was planning on keeping it
forever. Dropped it into my fletching kit and accidentally hit combine vs
done and poof.

Just last weekend I had a Petrified Erudite Heart<40-300 pp> drop to the
ground and a NPC behind me said ~"Ah, what luck! This looks like something I
could use" I looked down an the heart was gone. I killed the NPC. Heart
wasn't on him, but it made me feel better.

It's a level playing field. By that I mean we all operate under the same
exact rule set. Experience loss on death isn't nice or fun, it is part of
the game. These kind of things happen to everybody, you will probably get 10
or 12 responses to that effect. Don't lose sight of it actually happens to
their characters rather then themselves. A game doesn't have to be
reasonable or rational so much as fair.
