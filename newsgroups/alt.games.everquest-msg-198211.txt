Background: my guild trialled a DKP loot system for the last 10 weeks
or so and we were then asked to vote whether it had been a success or
not and whether they wanted to return to the previous merit (sic) or
keep points.

Anyway, almost 90% voted to retain DKP; this from the perspective of
a guild which can do pretty much everything outside Elementals purely
in guild but doesn't have mandatory raiding, mass password sharing,
SEQ abuse, huge bot armies or any of that [wannabe] uber guild
baggage so while we like our loot as much as the next person it's not
the raison d'etre.

From my own perspective it has been a *HUGELY* positive change, names
for loot are seen in public now as opposed to a select few
previously, points/attendance are posted on our webpage and can be
checked/queried at any time.  Loot issues have dropped almost to
zero.  The only minor issues are with guests and twinks but these
have been ironed out.  I cannot remember a single item where anyone
has cared that class X won it over class Y as people seem to be
wearing their sensible heads when putting in for loot (eg: no Mr Bard
you're not getting that +15% backstab dagger so feel free not to put
in unless none of the Rogues do.)

There's also a small band of people including myself who refuse to
let anything rot which would be a decent upgrade rather than hold out
for "dream" upgrades so wastage is no worse than it was before.  I've
had more upgrades in 10 weeks than the previous year and still have
enough points saved for one more really nice item or two decent ones.
I'm *almost* able to show my Magelo in public now.

Some items are really cheap, for example various masks etc drop while
doing the Carprin flag run in CoD and some of these cost less than
the points awarded for some single raids so it means you can upgrade
a weak slot and still *gain* points in an evening.  Of course the
upgrade isn't going to be endgame quality but an upgrade is an
upgrade, right?

The only stuff that has rotted than I can think of is utter junk that
twinks would have hoovered in the past and, erm, lots of Bows (Seru
bows, Tallon bows, HoH bows...)  Attendance wise we've lost some
casual raiders but they haven't been missed and one resolutely
anti-DKP formerly hardcore raider seems to have gone but he hasn't
been missed either.

Downsides: multiboxing and excessive AFK-ing to suck up points is the
only blemish so far - it's annoying but if people feel the need to be
"at" every raid when they clearly aren't then it's probably worth
avoiding the resulting drama that would happen if you called them on
it.  It's also a fun little game: /assist the bot and see if they
every actually target anything or anyone, watch them comically fall
down stairs and get stuck in corners while spending three hours on
auto follow and chuckle every time they die as the person running
them that night tries to work out what screen to watch when things
get interesting.
