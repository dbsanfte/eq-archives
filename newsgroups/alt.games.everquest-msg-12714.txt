Or, if you're a hairy assling...

You said you're level 20, so many of those may still be out of reach.
I'm guessing, since you aren't aware of how to get your wis to 200,
that this is your first character, and don't have alot of money.  I'm
also guessing, since I didn't see you mention your race, that you are
an assling or elf.  Here is what I would recommend, in your
level/price range:

EARS: Gold jasper earrings ~ These are 3 wis each, and average 75p ea
NECK: Black Iron Medalion ~ 3 wis, and cost about 25p.  You might also
get a group together in Runny Eye, and land one of these
FACE: Silver Ruby Veil ~ eh, 3 or 4 wis, and you can probably get one
of these for 150p if you're patient
HEAD: Crown of Leaves ~ 5 wis, and costs around 1k, but in a few
levels you can get one yourself.  I believe I was 24 or 25 when I got
mine, and got it fairly easy.  The biggest trouble was waiting for
Narra Tannith to spawn in SK.
FINGERS: Silver jasper rings ~ these are like 2 wis each, and cost
about 25-50p (sorry, don't remember).  If you have enough cash, go for
the platinum jasper rings, 6 wis each, and I paid 200p each for mine
WRISTS: Pollished Bone Bracers ~ 3 wis each, and cost about 150p each.
You can also get these in RE, off the Evil Eyes, while you're there
getting your BIM.
HANDS:  Split Paw Gloves are good for now, with the 2 wis for a few
pp.  If you have the money, though, you can get gnome skin gloves for
about 100p, which are 2 wis as well, but better ac/stats
ARMS: Platinum Armband ~ 3 wis, 200p
SHOULDERS: Braided Ivy Cords ~ 5 wis, about 250p
BACK: Kunzar Cloak ~ 2 wis, 200p
CHEST: Foremans Tunic ~ 3 wis, 100p
WAIST:  Not alot of belts out there that add wis, and the ones that
are available are goinna cost ya.  I recommend a Lizzardscale belt,
which adds mana, and only runs a few pp
LEGS: Gatorscale leggings ~ 4 wis, about 500p
BOOTS:  Again, not alot of choices out there, but if you can make your
way to Kurns, you might get lucky and have a pair of burynai hide
boots drop.  2 wis, may cost you about 500p if you look for them in EC

So there you have a few options, with almost 50 extra wis for around
2k.  *Note* these prices are from the Bertox server, and may vary on
yours.

Doh!  Forgot weapon slots.  While you're doing EE's (if you do them),
watch for something to drop called "evil eye lenses".  You can take
these to s gnome in Steamfont and turn them in for a +5 wis staff.  If
memory serves me right, the staff is 1hb, so it leaves room for the
ToV (another painful quest), +10 wis +10 mana.

Keep this in mind, when shopping for gear, that while wisdom is the
base of our spells, and very crucial, it may not be the deciding
factor in each piece of armor.  I have a 51 HUMAN druid, with a base
wis of 90, and with all my gear, it is only still 168.  This may sound
low to you, and it really is, but it's not that important.  I have
decent ac and agi, and at my level druids usually play a minimal role,
so I rarely get low on mana

My gear:

ears:  2 gold jasper earrings.  I did the giants in FM a little, and
never won a roll on the loops.  I didn't feel that the extra agi was
worth 1500-2000.
neck:  BIM.  Yes, I'm level 51 and still wearing the BIM I bought at
level 12.  This doesn't bother me, because I often swap it out for
resist gear
face: platinum ruby veil
head: Crown of Leaves.  Like I said, waiting for Nara to spawn was
quite painful, so I consider this one of my prized posessions
fingers: 2 plat jasper rings.  I had a golem tear ring for a while,
but thought it would benefit my pally more
wrists: chipped bone bracers.  After many, many lost rolls on RMB's in
Slob, I went and camped Oowomp for a week before getting two of them.
hands: gnome skin gloves
arms: ulthork hide sleeves.  The str was nice the plat armband, but
the 8ac on these are nicer
shoulders: braided ivy cords
back: Dreadskin cloak
chest: crystal covered shroud. A druid in a dress... but atleast it
lessens the amount of "port me plz thx" tells I get, since they think
I'm a monk or mage
legs: gatorscale leggins
boots: Sandals of Harmony.  Funky green and funky stats, but it's mana
free SoW and ac
primary: Tunarian scimmy
secondary: ToV
