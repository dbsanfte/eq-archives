Not sure but magelo

www.magelo.com

reflects it accurately.

So you can make a char with your class, level and stats and then 
play with sta to see how much it affects HP.  On the lower end its not
really that much, like if you had a class/race character that started
at 70 stamina adding 15 points to that would hardly do anything,
basically at level 60 a wood elf druid  would have 35 - 40 more hit
points. The important part is me saying "at level 60." Before that its
going to be even fewer.

For a melee type, the sweet spot for stamina is 100 since then
your weapon swings don't slow when fatigued (swinging a couple weapons
during fights) Beyond that it doesn't seem to add much hp until you
get to aroun ogre range of 150 or so plus.

So its sort of relative and the best way to see is make a dummy
character in magelo. Check your hp at a target level for a target
stamina, then see if they'd increase much if you were to have 10
higher Sta.
