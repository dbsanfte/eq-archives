The only thing i would like to add is the fallback and fallforward parts of
a modem... but even that would explain why they are connecting at a slower
speed. and honestly its just not within the TCP/IP suite of protocols to
limit your connection speed AFTER you users have dialed up... sorry that
just doesnt jive at all.
