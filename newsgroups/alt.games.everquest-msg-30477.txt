As I stated in another thread....

I think Verant expected a few Red guilds battling each other on the Blue
servers.  As it is, I haven't seen anything like that.  I don't even recall
hearing of any guild wars in the past year, either.

Even though Verant has said EQ isn't designed with PvP in mind, they did
make PvP much more possible than what players are currently utilizing.

That tells me that most EQ'ers don't want PK'ing to be a regular part of
their EQ experience.

Want to start something unique?  Try starting a Red guild on a Blue server.
And hope a couple rival Red guilds develop. :-)
