Matrix didn't exactly leave me thoughtful at the end.  Fight Club left me
thoughful.  Utena left me thoughful.  Sixth Sense left me thoughful.  Matrix
left me with "well, that was fun."

And if I hear one more fanboy quoting the whole "humans are just a parasite"
crap as if it's deep philosophy, I'm going to stick an Orc Pawn Pick in his
forehead.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
