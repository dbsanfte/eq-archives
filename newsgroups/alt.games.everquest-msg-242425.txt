The market seems a bit glutted right now with all the anniversary
skellies reliably dropping 1 or 2 bone chips each. I can vendor dive
for 1 or 2 stacks easy in QH, SF, and EF, and on one occasion got 8
stacks just from the two merchants in QH. I have 8 slot bags filling
up my bank and I'd say about 1 out of every two slots is filled with
bone chips. (Even after I got to ally with the Dwarves of Kaladim
using their bone chip quest.) I don't know what I'm holding on to them
for, except that I'm considering 2Boxing in the future, and might want
to use them to level the new char.
