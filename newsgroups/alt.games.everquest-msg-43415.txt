As a wizard, i'll take vurtually any donation that's offered to me for
a teleport. I've received coin (of course), gems, various weapons i
could not use, even a stack of rat sandwiches once (which i handed out
to subsequent riders on future teleports, as a sort of
"in-flight-snack").

When i shout that i'm available for teleports, i never mention
donations, nor do i state a price; however, if something, anything, is
put in a trade window to me, i'm going to accept it. Although, if you
don't donate, i don't care, as long as you're patient (especially if
i'm waiting for more than one person to show up for  a port) and
polite and at least say Thanks.

The only time this does not hold true is when i'm insulted by a rude
or demanding character who has the gall to do something like offer me
1 cp, especially since i don't state a price or that i *expect* a
donation. In that case, the trade gets cancelled, the character gets
bonked on the head, they are left behind, and their name is added to
my "no-ports-for-you-ever-under-any-circumstances" list, and also
posted to every blacklist i can find. They're lucky if i don't de-buff
them before i leave...  If you're a post-40 character decked out with
all the best armor and such, you'd better offer me ~something~
respectable. Especially if you've sent me a tell out of nowhere, and
interrupted whatever i was doing at the time.

Now, if you're requiring the teleporter in question to take you into a
dangerous area, such as the Iceclad port yard, or Emerald Jungle, or
Skyshrine, for instance, you will certainly win points with the
teleporter if you offer them more than what you would normally offer
for say, a port to West Commons.

The only time i require a donation is for the Translocates which
require me to have a portal fragment as a component. These cost me
platinum, and i'll certainly require you to pay for the service,
minimum 25 plat.

Oh yeah, there is one other time you'll have to pay for a port, and
that's if i'm taking you to one of the planes. The components for the
planar teleports are DAMNED expensive, and you'll have to pay up
front, no if's, and's or but's about it. The spell won't be cast until
you cross my palm with platinum.

Personally, i also keep a "free-ports-forever" list, with the names of
characters who have impressed me in some fashion in the past. Note:
most wizards keep such a list. Roleplaying, clerics who give free
rezzes, helping me out in my time time of need, giving me troll-shaped
cookies, casting clarity on me every time you see me for no reason or
without me asking, supplying me with reasonably priced SoW potions,
and just being a generally cool person will certainly land your name
on my "free-ports-forever" list. If you're name's on that list, i'll
never accept anything from you in trade for a port (unless it's some
sort of yummy food - i especially like Barbecued Erudite!).

As for binds, well, if they're a lower level caster, it's nice to
offer a few coins (usually no more than 1 pp) for the service, just to
help them out a little bit. Most higher level casters won't accept
money for binds anyway; i certainly don't.

At your level, i would say 5-10 pp for a port to the more "common"
areas is more than reasonable, 15-20 if you're feeling especially
generous and want to be remembered. It's like dining at a restaurant,
if you tip nice, you'll surely be remembered, and will likely get
excellent service when you return again in the future.

Apologies for the lengthy post, but i hope this puts some perspective
on the issue for you.
