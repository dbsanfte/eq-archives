Gee.  I've been 54 for over a month.  I wish someone would've told me
how great 54 could be!!!

I do a lot of duo'ing with a warrior bud or small'ish guild groups.
Adding my pet hammer (Brell, but I love that little guy) and my little
DS and my bigger nuke (all courtesy of 54) really makes the mobs fall
faster.  

Heck, all this time I was rushing to 56 (ok, rushing is a very
relative term... *cough*) but now I don't feel so bad.  54 is all
good.

Been goofing around Chardok lately (can you say EMPTY?  heh, I love
PoP) and in small or large groups the exp just rolls in.  Plus, I have
YET to have my Pacify get resisted.  So, I often find myself in the
roll of puller if we don't have any sort of crowd control.  When we do
get adds I nuke, drag 'em away and root 'em.  [a good shaman taught me
the brute force method of crowd control].  Been good for the ol'
neglected Defense skill.  Has gone up 5 pts in the last week :-)  My
warrior buddies let me get slapped around a bit first (we all want my
defense to go up) then they taunt it off and smack it down.

Ok, just had to rave about how much I like 54.  Really made the cleric
roll feel a bit 'different' for me - and that's good, I was feeling
stagnant.  Granted, the root parking I've been doing for a while,
but...  *sniffle*  I do love my pet.  :-)
