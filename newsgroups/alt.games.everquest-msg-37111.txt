Myself in Rathe Mountains before 39:

/ooc can anyone in zone do a rez?
(think to myself, nope. I only can do a rev.)
/ cleric
38 Tiru
(no rez for joo!)
/ooc I can rev. I'm at loc X Y. Bring it here, if you like.
/ooc I want a rez. can anyone rez?? (repeat ad nauseum)
Meanwhile
N tells you, are you still at that loc? Can I bring a friend over for a
rev?

I usually made 20pp per rev. Strictly donated. Sometimes, they gave
nothing. It felt good to help.
