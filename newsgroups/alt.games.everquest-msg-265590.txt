I've not actually measured it, but unless they did something radically
wrong, EQ2 should be comparable to other MMORPGs when it comes to the net.
If so, that would mean that it doesn't need a lot of bandwidth, except
possibly when zoning.  Even a 56k modem is likely to be good enough on
bandwidth.

Latency is what will be the problem on 56k.  MMORPGs aren't as sensitive to
this as, say first person shooter games, but modems get high enough that you
can start to notice control issues.

A typical DSL connection should be fine on latency.

My DSL is fine for EQ2, and it has fairly high latency for DSL.  It's 50ms
to the gateway.

So, for MMORPGs, it should be fine to get the lowest speed DSL that is
available to you.  That should have good latency, and plenty of bandwidth
for playing.
