okay, what i have noticed over my 35 levels as a ranger is that we walk a
difficult path. You have to be constantly aware of what you're doing. to
play a ranger into high levels, you have to enjoy the class because it is a
lot of work, as are most other classes when played correctly. we dish out
the damage, and between taunt and snare, the mob may never look at the other
tanks in your group cuz it just doesn't like you. When it comes to pulling,
we truly shine. In an indoor zone like a dungeon, our skills are not at
full, and a monk can outpull us any day there. but in the great outdoors no
one is better...multiple mobs? harmony before pulling. Snare taunt effect?
snare to pull and then arrow kite all the way back to group, then stand back
with your bow while the other tanks get a few good hits on it. SoW,
camouflage, etc.

It would be hard to run through a list of all the strategies i've seen. the
main thing is you need to understand your spells and your skills. you need
to pay attention how they compliment that might be in your group. as to the
complaints of rangers being mana sponges and aggroing everything, it doesn't
have to be that way at all, if you go about it smart (always will be
exceptions). One of the best things about our ability to build up hate so
quickly and aggro a mob, is that we make for excellent bodyguards. So let
the other tanks stay on the original mob, you should be able to get it off
the caster rather quickly.

many other things have been covered here already so i'll end it there. last
thing i'll say is that i've enjoyed playing a ranger more then any other
class i've played in the game. in the end it does come down to you, and
wether you like the class and are willing to make the sacrifices. (oh yeah,
we're starting to improve our image over all)
