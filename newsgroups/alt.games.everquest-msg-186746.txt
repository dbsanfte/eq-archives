When I started to write this, I had planned to right something in the
"Monual Style" that I enjoy reading so much.  Then I realized that
this was far from uber, so allow me to tell the abridged version...
(no really, it could be MUCH longer!)

I started my cleric in August of 2001 mainly as a diversion from my
bard (and aching wrists).  As time went on, I realized that not only
did I enjoy playing the cleric more than the bard, but the cleric was
much more useful to the folks in my guild not at high levels.
HOWEVER, I had steadily maintained that I would never bother with the
epic.  I'm not a hardcore gamer and the epic held little interest for
me.  My guild was, for the most part, a lot of younger characters and
we just didn't need it either.

Then many of us began to enter the 50s.  Experience begins to come
slower.  Deaths hurt more.  I began to reconsider.  By the end of
December 02, I had decided it was time to wade in and give the ol'
college try.

----

Camping.  Yep, that sums up much of the cleric epic to begin with.
LOTS of camping.  Oh - and shard farming in SF.  I am so sick of
Skyfire I could just barely go back for the last encounter.  The good
news is the my grind group learned how to effectively handle Guardian
Wurms.  Fun stuff for a bunch of folks in their mid 50s.  We like
GW's, they're fun.  Chromos?  Bah - we keeled lots of chromos.  They
go down like a drunk ^H^H^H^H.  Anyways, they die easy.  Pretty soon
(heh, ok after about 3 weeks of farming) I had the shards.  We'd
already done Ixi with some ally help.  All the boring/green camps were
done.  But Chardok.  Ahhh, what about Chardok?  My guild couldn't pull
it off on our own, and are ally relationships weren't quite what they
could/should be.  I was stumped and stuck.

Then a few things happened that turned the tide.  
1 - an old ex-guildie decides to take some time off from the raiding
life and hang out with us little people (he's a 65 SK).  
2 - I get invited to join a non-guild / under-guild full of folks I
like and have known for years.  What is an under-guild?   Well, that
may not be what everyone calls it, but that's my term.  A bunch of
folks in guilds similar to mine (non-raiding/non-uber) who all get
along well and raid well together.  We still have our guild-tags, but
often help each other with large encounters and epic stuff.  Also a
good source of fun and companionable grinds.  The 'leader' of this
under-guild decides it is time to get some cleric epics done and we
organize a chardok raid.  We have the 65 SK as MT and a 62 or 63 monk
pulling the way.  I think we had 4 groups of mostly mid to late 50s
and the slaughter was wonderful to behold.  Much wailing in the depths
of Chardok by the widows when we left.

This all happened Saturday night.  Killed the Overking and Prince a
few times and had a great time.  I think I was online for around 8
hours (which is extreme for me) BUT I had the Overking drop.  I won
first loot (of the other clerics) with a 140'ish out of 300 roll!
Sheesh, crap roll - but it won.

I'm excited, guildies are excited.  "What's left, Darken?" they all
ask.  I look over my notes at 2am Saturday night and say that it looks
like I need to swim Tim Deep for some turnins, then run into Nagafen's
Lair and do a turn in, and then we can do Ragefire sunday night.  Much
rejoicing is heard in /gu!

Sunday morning I log on.  Get a few friends to help me work my way
through Nagafen's lair and get to where we need to be.  But wait!
Zordak Ragefire isn't there?!?  Oh no.  Off to Allakawhatsits.com to
check on spawn time.  24 or more hours?!?  Oh no.  Another camp.  I'm
just about suicidal.  Another camp?!?  Gads, I can't do it.  But I do.

Had to fix my daughter's computer, so I just set it on the desk next
to me and look over at EQ every 5 minutes or so... I know I have to
leave the house for an hour or so, so I'm hoping the pop comes soon.
About an hour before I have to log (after 6 or 7 hours), a friend
offers to run a piece of equipment I'd been looking for (clicky Pacify
- I pull in dungeons when no chanter or bard around).  She rounds up a
3 man group of low to mid 50s and they start carving their way in to
where I am (lots of DB at the level and good exp).  Unfortunately,
they train me at the very end and I have to leave, so I *sigh* in
disgust and log off, feeling very much defeated.

----

2 hours later I'm back.  My friend and Guild Leader, a druid, had
bound himself in Nag's Lair at the spawn spot.  He gates in and shouts
out, just as I'm logging in, "He's UP!".   In a great hurry, I grab
the SK friend and boogie for Lavastorm.  Zone in.  He summon's me, I
res (90%, of course) myself and we start carving our way to where
Ragefire sits under the giant's gate.  3 minutes later I do the turn
in and the druid ports us to Skyfire.

Rest is pretty standard stuff.  Put the call out to the guildies and
friends, assemble in SF and beat down Ragefire x2.  I died.  Heck, I
think all the cleric's died actually.  But the dragon went down.

Off we go to Tim Deep again.  (I won't miss that jaunt).

20 minutes later I have my Water Sprinkler.  A friend, 57 chanter,
immediately challenged the 65 SK to a duel.  He wanted to be the first
one clicked.  :-)

Decidedly non-uber for most of you, but 3 days later I'm still
grinning about it.  And very glad 'tis done.
