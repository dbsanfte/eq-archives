That is one possible conclusion, the other is that both conditions affect
both Agility, and movement rate.

I could also come to the conclusion that AC affects movement rate based on
those same situations.  When you are encumbered, your AC drops, when you are
injured your AC drops, you also move slower under both conditions, therefor
AC must affect movement rate.

It has been tested, not by injuring and burdening a character, but by
running a fixed course with different values of Agility, and timing how long
it takes to do the run.  The result of this test was that Agility has no
effect on movement rate.

What you are presenting is anecdotal evidence.  That is why it is being
scoffed at.  If you were to perform a controlled test, and prove it in that
fashion, that would be different.   My personal observations contradict
yours, but that is merely more anecdotal evidence.  I have seen the results
of a test where just the effects of different values of Agility were tested,
and they showed that Agility, in and as of itself, has no measurable effect
on movement rate.  If you perform tests that show otherwise, I would be
interested in seeing them.
