Broken quests are by and large detectable by automated processes. Broken 
quests in EQ1 at least tend to fall into one of several categories:

There are a few fail conditions that only a human could find, but many 
of the most common ones are testable by a tool.

I really think you're underestimating what good quest design tools could 
do. :) 

And artists and game designers aren't really required for content 
creation (at least not quest content). Few quests have unique artwork. 
Fewer still have mechanics that would require special coding outside 
what a generic tool could provide.

New servers don't get brought online. :)

In fact, if you want to have a player directed living world. You should 
really maintain just one. It would be far more work to maintain 
different servers that go down different paths.

EQ2s load balancing instancing would probably suffice for this, along 
with a bigger world of course.
