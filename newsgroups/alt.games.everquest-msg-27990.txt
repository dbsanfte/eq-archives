Au contraire. I did it at 22, with a 22 druid partner to help with
tracking, combat and camo through Nektulos.

Since the items are "no drop", they are frequently left on the mob's
corpse, and can be picked up by asking nicely (the hilt in Najeena
being the hard part, since the skeletons have been moved, and the drop
rate is apparently much lower than during the early days of this
quest. I'm doing the quest again for a guildmate, and am currently 0
drops for 33 kills... however, if anyone would like some nice cloth
sandals, I have approximately 33 pair, slightly used, only worn by
_a_skeleton_ to wander around in Najeena).

At any rate, the first time around, it took 6 hours, most of which was
spent traveling back and forth on the boat. This time, since the spawn
rate has been slowed and the drop rate has been reduced, we've been at
it for a couple of nights to get the various parts and NPC items
needed for everyone in the group (as long as we're going, we might as
well make one each...)

The skeletons are still there, they just aren't conveniently right
inside the front entrance anymore.
