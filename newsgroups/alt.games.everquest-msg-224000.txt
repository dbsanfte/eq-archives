How does the hate generated by a mere Furious Bash 2 (ala zek crested
buckler) compare to the hate generated by, say, a copper hammer of
striking? I've never played a bashing character, so I've no perspective on
the hate generated by a bash...just that FB 2 will increase it by 20%.

This shield is so cheap, and I can't remember a time I've seen a warrior
using it, that I wonder if it's just that most warriors hate giving up
DPS, or if there are proccing weapons that take aggro better.  *Seems* to
me that increased aggro on bash is preferrable, because you have control
over bashing...unlike procs.  But maybe 20% increased bash still doesn't
even come close to the occasional stun proc.

And AC does "work" for warriors, right?  It often feels like a joke to my
ranger that I even bother with AC, but I heard a rumour that it actually
matters for knights and warriors.  (Hard to imagine, but you know how
insidious those rumours are!)
