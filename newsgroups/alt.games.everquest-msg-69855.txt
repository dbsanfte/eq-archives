Well, I only have one of the problems you mentioned, and nothing I've done
so far has helped -- the white pointer of doom in the middle of the screen.
Only thing I noticed when I upgraded my 128mb to 256 was that I could at
least run the game. But the mouse pointer is still there. Wish I could help
with your other problems.
