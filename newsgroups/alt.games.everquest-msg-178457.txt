It all depends how much the enchanter can make doing other things. Why
bother sitting in bazaare selling at 10p a pop if you can make heaps more
farming items, or even slumming it and killing HG's. My lvl 62 pet can solo
a HG in under 60 seconds, so figure how much I can make an hour that way. I
could go farm dead side of guk and probably average about 1000p/hour after
selling. I could run solb and farm about 4 rare spawns there and make a
killing. Basically if people want me to sit in bazaar clicking a button,
then they have to make it worth my while. I dont consider that greedy.
