You don't need it to go into the dungeons at all.  What it does is allow 
you to use the Magi to port directly from wayfarer camp to wayfarer camp.

Also, something I learned the very hard way:
If you enter a starting city, you *have* to go to the person in that city.  
I ran around for well over an hour going from Surefall, to West Karana, to 
Qeynos.  I'd hail the NPC and get absolutely no reply.  Since I had 
accidentally clicked on the Freeport stone when I was meaning to go to 
Qeynos (I know, I just wasn't paying attention), I got the message about 
the NPC in Freeport, and suddenly I can't get a single reply out of any of 
the other NPCs.
