OK, now what is durationformula 10?  Are you privy to what the formula
number 10 is?  My best guess from reading that is that durationformula tells
EQ which formula to use to calculate the duration of the spell.  I would
hazard a guess that formula 10 is one that scales the duration from 18.4
minutes at level 58 to 20.5 minutes at level 65.  I would also hazard a
guess that durationformula 11 means just use the duration listed in ticks,
perhaps with info on what foci affect it.

I certainly see no reason at all to believe that durationformula 10 means 10
minutes, I can't even imagine why you would think that is the case.
