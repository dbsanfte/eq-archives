I did see you corrected yourself later, but damn - I wish stuff in
ammo slot gave stats. I recently got my enchanter his jewelcraft
trophy, with all the great stats, but with much dismay, discovered
that stats dont take effect in the ammo slot - GRRRR. Other than the
huge cha bonus, its not nearly as good as my other equipment in the
other slots it can go in, so, i have an expensive very limited
situational piece of equipment =/
