Get some Shaman buffs Agi sheilds and SOW and Regen find a whole mess of low
Greens that you can easily whip. Taunt hit but dont kill anything to get as
many to attack as possiblr and let them beat on you. Kill them or run when
you get to 1 bub of health get healed and repeat high level buffs will last
an hour.
