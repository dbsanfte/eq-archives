While that is true its incomplete. Its highly probable that these 
systems will be retrofitted onto existing games.

Unlike your other post where you observed that people who didn't like 
magic could go right on playing crazy-8s or chess failed to account for 
the fact that people who like playing EQ without microtransactions are 
at the mercy of Sony. If Sony introduces them we can't play without 
them. If the other major corporations follow suit there will be no 
options available.

No. I'm just observing that mmogs do not exist in a functioning free 
market in the first place, so assuming entrepreneurial capitalism will 
step up to correct a market failure is demented.

Next you'll be pondering why there isn't a way to watch TV without 
network logos dancing through the programs... surely if people wanted 
that (and we all know they do) then someone would do it... (which we all 
know better than to hold our breath for).
