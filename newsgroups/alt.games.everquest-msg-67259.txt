As I understand it, it's the GM's "ingame" term for getting a warning on
your account. Basically showing on your record that you've been given a
verbal warning, reprimand, chastized, etc. for being a dickhead, bending
or breaking rules, grief playing, etc.

On the reverse side, players can also (rarely) receive positive "soul
marks" giving them a written track record of being helpful, good
players. I was present in OoT recently when a GM made a zone wide (hell,
might have been serverwide, not sure) announcement that so-and-so had
been "..commended by the Gods for being a good and noble player" or
something to that effect.
