  Hi!  Does anyone know of a place to buy spider or spiderling silks?  I'm
guessing there isn't one, but I thought I'd ask.

  Also, are any of you on the Veeshan server and are a brewer or smith?  if
so, could I buy some heady kiolas or metal studs off you?  I'll message you
in the game, whenever we can play for more than 5 mins without a patch... :(
