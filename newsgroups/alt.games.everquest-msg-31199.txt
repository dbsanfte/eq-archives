There is no graceful way to deal with people who spit when they talk, so I 
just avoid talking with them at all.

There's only two types of names I'll petition.  First, the names that are 
glaringly obscene.  Fortunately these seem very rare.  The other kind is 
the sort that give themselves a false honorific.  Examples I've seen on my 
server are Maxthehealer and Louiethelizard.  This is, INHO, a dis on the 
people who have earned their genuine honorifics.

I see no point in trying to explain to either of these sorts of people the 
problem with their name.

atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
