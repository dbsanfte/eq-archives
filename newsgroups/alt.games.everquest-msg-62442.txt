    Yes, it does. Which doesn't explain how my rogue can walk up to all the
non-named kobolds, and I do mean ALL of them, from the front and pet them on
the nose with no problems. Sneak won't help me in the front arc, and it
certainly doesn't help me at a range of zero point zero.

    I'm convinced that rogue Hide is just plain coded differently, and Sneak
doesn't enter into it. When zoning into Sol B to a train without bats in it,
I'd just jam on Hide and stand still, and nothing would see me. Even if
stuff was lingering at the zone (like kobold shamans buffing other parts of
the train), it wouldn't see me - so the "grace period" after zoning had
certainly expired.
