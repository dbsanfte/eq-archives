There are many books out thr that reveil recipe's and that and a little
spice to the game.

Here my question.....
Heard of Brodder's Diary?  There are six in all i beleive and they tell of
the life of Brodder
however....  It is in a different lang... I an read some of it but not all
of it.  Anyone know what language it is
in?  Or where online i can find out more about the misc books?  I have
already checked out the most popular sites.
