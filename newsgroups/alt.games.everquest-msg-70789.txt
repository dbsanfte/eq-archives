You know, Dan, what I'm hearing? And yes, I know this is an extreme, but
this is it:
"Hey! You, Cleric! I don't give a rat fuck if the tank got a Lammy and
the Pally got a CSS and and the Druid got a (insert some uber druid
fucking crap here)! You can keep the crap gems as long as they don't
exceed BY ONE FUCKING COPPER what it cost you in reagents to keep us
buffed and alive for that five hour camp! I better get EVERY LAST
FUCKING 1/6 of the COPPER DROPPED THAT'S COMING TO ME YOU STINGY
BASTARD! You're participation in this group was basically WORTHLESS
except to SUCK UP CASH!"

Yeah, Dan, that's extreme. But that's what I hear. High level clerics
are precious, and the drops for them in zones like Seb are often crap.
But you can't have a group there without them. We are busting our asses
to get epics for our clerics, and your attitude shocks the hell out of
me. It's a few plat, man. Let it go. Your clerics are a treasure. Treat
them that way. As a tank, trust me, I do.
