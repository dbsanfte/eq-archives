Interesting. I hadn't considered the weight angle at all. I suppose that a stack
of food that was nearly weightless and either lasted a long time or gave an
interesting bonus would attractive to a monk or a race that has a hard time
buying food in the local cities.

I wonder what effect the local environment has? Woolie spider crunchies,
for instance, are likely to be more in demand in Halas than in Ro. (+2 sv Cold,
-1 sv Fire).

Here's a question: When you have a pet, do stat-affecting items affect
a pet that wields them? If you give a Mammoth Steak to your pet, is there
any way to tell whether it gets the +2Str bonus?
