Yep, it was a combination of warriors not getting the full advantage of
armor and some monk items (AoW, NToV, VT) being a bit too good. This was
fixed in PoP anyway where monk items are once again dramatically inferior
to plat items.

No, just monks. Druids and Beastlords noticed no change in their mitigation.
Since beastlords have monk avoidance, no weight limit and can use the broken
items this seemed weird to many people.

Agreed. The current state of the monk class is rogue-lite. Now that SoE have
shown they still don't get it I can start stripping my epic monk.
