Well, if this is the case, then I guess only time will tell if he was
serious or not. I turned off my KF (which he was in) once I saw that
there were no more messages being filtered out. Normally, I probably
wouldn't have even seen this message from him. Anyways, hopefully he has
seen the light and changed for the better. Again, only time will tell.
