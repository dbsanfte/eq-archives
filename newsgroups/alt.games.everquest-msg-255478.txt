This is, of course, quite true.  My cleric happily tools along in a small
friendly guild doing her best to keep people alive and well.  So it's not like
all of my experiences have been bad.  Just not what I expected.  If you'd have
told me 3 years ago I'd be a 65 cleric in the future I probably would have
laughed.
