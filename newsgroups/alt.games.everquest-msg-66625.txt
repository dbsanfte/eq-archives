Yeah?  So what?  Before a particular piece of land in my neighbourhood was
bought by developers, there was a nice little park on it where kids played.
Now there's a butt-ugly 7-floor condo.  Things change.  Sometimes, you have
no control over it.  Sure the people living around here complained to the
city about the condo going up, but it was built anyway, and now people have
to deal with it.  EQ worked fine on my computer before the patches.  EQ,
despite zoning rather more slowly, works fine on my computer after the
patches.  The question you have to ask yourself is "What's different about
my computer that makes the game crash, while it runs fine on a machine owned
by this Paul person?"  Then send your system specs and a description of the
problem to the people who actually know the code and how it interacts with
hardware drivers and other software, so that they can make use of the
information and release a patch if it's a common complaint.  Odds are, you
won't get a reply from them, but the information will be noted and passed
along.  That's generally how tech departments in large companies work.  When
they're not sitting around a fooze-ball table, complaining about the
clients...
