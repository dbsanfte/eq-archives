Now I'm no great math wiz or anything but I am pretty sure that when you
have 0% of something it means you have none as in zero, nada, zip, bubkis,
nothing. So why is it in the last two days I've been killed by monsters with
0% health left. Come on aren't these guys dead if they have 0% health left?
It's a good thing SOE isn't in the car financing business or else that sweet
0% interest loan I got on my car would really suck.
