Did you ever  think that, perhaps, people should have some self controll,
and not rely on society to govern there every action? I have posted this
befor and I say it again - if someone get so wraped up in a game that they
loose them selves to it, then they have deeper mental issues and should seek
help as soon as possable.

Do not blame Sony for putting out a qualtiy product.
Do not blame the game - it does not "controll your mind"

**** Blame the parents for not researching the game properly.*****

***** Blame your self for not haveing enuff self controll to get off your
ass. *****

Think had before you resond, you know I am right.
