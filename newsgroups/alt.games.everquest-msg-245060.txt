Yes, I wrote "Section". It's my fault for having read many bills lately and 
not having refered to the USC for a month or two.

Do you happen to have an example of a copyright being released to the 
public domain by virtue of a non-prosecuted infringement, as your original 
argument seems to say?

I may take a look at these, thanks.

Yes... which is kind of the point, really. Tacitly allowing infringing and 
derivative works has not harmed Disney's ability to sue over these 
infractions in a different case.

While my mom's library was extensive, I think it was even weirder. Example: 
My mom has a 1st edition of "Collected Superstition of the Ozarks". 

Mickey is an interesting and non-standard case, as Disney has a lot of say 
in copyright law (given that copyright lifetime keeps getting extended to 
keep him covered)
