I am not evaluating EQ as a business proposition, you arrogant prick.  I
am evaluating it as a gamer and player.  The game isnt tested enough
based on how many problems slip through the cracks EVERY time they add
to the game.

Jackass.  You cant have it both ways.  They test adequately or they
dont.  I say they dont.  What are you trying to say?

And I see you are just a dickhead who likes to argue.

They dont give a fuck about QA.  If they gave a fuck, or had a shred of
pride in their job, there wouldnt be so many shipping bugs.  And more
importantly, they wouldnt make the same mistakes over and over and over
and over again.  But, they do.

You are right.  It proves either they dont have paid testers, they dont
use their paid testers or their paid testers are grossly incompetent.
Take your pick.

And yet, they dont test their changes.  That is documented time and time
again in patch after patch.  The fact that you are disagreeing with me
tells me you cant be reasoned with and you are not going to ever see a
point of view on this outside of your own.

LOL wrong again?  They cant afford more testing?  WTF are you talking
about?

And the testing/debugging system they have in place does *not* work.
Unless by work you mean fails to detect bugs that would have been
detected if just one person had tested the change on any server.

I agree with this.  But, just because they dont have incentive to do
things better does not mean they are doing the best they can.  Clearly,
that isnt the case as I see numerous bugs addressed in every patch, many
of them the obvious result of a complete lack of testing a previous
change.

Ha so when something is the market leader its automatically doing the
best it can!  What a revelation!  You are a fucking genius.
