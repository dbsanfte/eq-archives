    The lack of things to do other than Time is what is killing it for most
guilds. LDoN raids aren't really what you'd call good risk/reward, they
exclude people, and they require someone to stay online and active for a
very long time, so a lot of high-end guilds are giving them a pass. So that
means you log on once or twice a week for your Time rotation, then go do
something else the rest of the week. The sorts of people that are in a lot
of high-end guilds don't like being idle, so they move to other games.

    Time isn't so bad, to be honest. Not a lot of trash clearing, which is
the most boring part of a raid. We're just beginning to rot phase 1 stuff
and get tells from bots on phase 2 stuff, and it's still a blast to go and
kill god after god. That's the real appeal of the zone - with one brief
pause when you hit phase five, from the last two mobs of phase 3 onwards
you're killing loot mob after loot mob without pause. 11 loot mobs in a row
is fun, because (with the exception of the first two) they're challenging
fights that require some strategy.

    Unless your guild is swimming in loot, though, with characters decked
out like Christmas trees, you should be thinking in min/max mode. You have
to balance that against recognition for individual effort, but you always
have to think "what is going to improve my guild the most?" Reason? The
further you progress, the more options you have for doing things on a given
night. Letting some warrior up his HPs by 5 versus upping another's by 60+,
or letting a wizard loot the haste ring in Air because it has nice +MANA
(that happened in the other guild, too) doesn't improve your guild, it hurts
it long-term.

    On regular second box characters, we track points but it's understood
that they can't get crap-all unless every main passes. Usually the officers
will send them a tell if nobody asks for a given drop, so they can pick it
up without having to roll for it. When others are second-boxed, the points
all go to the person actually playing the toon, and they get no bonus for
having 1, 2, or 20 characters there. If someone tried to pull what you're
describing, they'd get an administrative warning and be told in no uncertain
terms that their future in the guild depends on them being honest.

    I've enjoyed LDoN raids greatly, if for no other reasons than the lack
of lag and the competency. Only 36 people, none of which are second boxes?
Right on!

    A lot of them think that without them, the raid would collapse. There's
very few second boxes that actually add significant value to as large a
group as a raid, and lots of second boxes that actually make a raid less
efficient (lag, poor response times, etc)
