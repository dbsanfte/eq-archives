My character is in need of some Aviak feathers to research some spells. I
have spent quite a lot of time in SK and Lake Rathetear hunting Aviaks but
have had no luck in obtaining the desired items. My questions are, firstly,
are the feathers a common drop or a rare one? and secondly, should i be
hunting a specific type of Aviak, eg Darters, Egrets to get what i need or
will they drop from any type of Aviak?.

    Thanks in advance.
