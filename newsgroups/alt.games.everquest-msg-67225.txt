I'm using a 1G Athlon Thunderbird.   Currently have 256M of DDR PC2100 RAM,
but have 512M more on order.   So far, the only problems I've seen are the ones that
are related to Win2K Sound blaster Live support (and have been present since before
Luclin).   With all the patches, EQ is improving day by day.  There a plenty of glitches
present still, like my character going bald after visiting a merchant, but those are EQ
bugs that will be fixed eventually after the other larger issues such as loading time,
frame rate problems.

AMD seems like a good way to go.  I've had my FIC motherboard-based system
for about 6 months.  Zero problems.
