I've seen this stated a number of times.  Is there non-level advancement in
WoW that goes slowly (equipment, skills, faction, etc), or is it basically a
fast game?

If it's really all that fast, are there people who've maxxed out already?  Can
I start a character in March and be ready for high-end content with friends
who've been playing for 4 months in a few dozen hours of mad levelling?

If the game is so easy, how can farming/powerlevelling matter?
