My cleric has a naked wis of 100.  Rare indeed is the occaision when
I regret that.  I -do- occaisionally regret putting points into STR rather
than STA, mind you.

Thing to remember about your mana pool is that no matter how deep
it is, it regenerates at the same rate.  A deep pool of mana is only
needed occaisionally, when working at extremes.  It won't raise
your kills per hour rate, that comes strictly from the supply of fresh
mana.   You may need more mana to keep someone alive in a massive
overpull, or killing a tough mob that you probably shouldn't have
pulled in the first place, but not on a day to day exp gathering expedition.
If you go OOM, then there's a very long sit involved getting back to
FM, and if your puller goes out with you at less than FM then he's
essentially saying you can operate with a smaller mana pool.  With
a 95 wisdom, I'm betting your mana pool is full well before those
of the other casters in your groups.

This said, there are plenty of ways to deepen your mana pool.  Collect
Wis bonus gear, and mana bonus gear.  Dressed, my cleric is at 201
wisdom and plus 500 mana over that... he's been at or near the 200 mark
since his 30s, upgrading equipment for better AC, mana, HP, clickables,
and resists while keeping that wisdom right around the same spot.

On the rare occaision when I need to do a naked Corpse Recovery,
I don't notice my lack of mana pool very much, spells seem to take
three times their normal bite out of my pool, but I also "seem" to
regenerate mana three times as quickly.  Worse than the mana pool
problem is the feeling that I'm as defenseless as a druid, with hardly
any HP or AC to keep me alive if I aggro.

59 cleric, Morell Thule

note, my first cleric was a High Elf I ran to level 49, with a base
wisdom of nearly 150... so it wasn't ignorance that made Bergh
take a starting wis of 100
