Context it is all about context.
If you are using a threaded reader and reading the messages just once a 
day then top posting seems reasonable, but if you are reading the 
messages as they appear then you loose all context with top posting.
Some one could reply "Yes, easy for a level 50", but you would have no 
idea what was easy or for what class etc. etc.

I think that the prefered method is bottom posting with adiquate 
snipping proper atribution, and "mid-posting" where applicable.
