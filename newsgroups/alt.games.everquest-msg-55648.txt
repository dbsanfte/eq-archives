Also.  Keep leveling, this is about the fastest way to get what you want
when a new player.  Soon you'll be able to receive money for ports, though,
I sincerely doubt this hasn't crossed your mind. :)

I agree.  The only way to increase your Defense skill (mumbles something
about VI here) is to get hit.  It sounds almost foolish for me or anyone
else to suggest that you get hit on -purpose- though, it's -much- easier now
(or rather safer, for the lack of a better word) to raise this skill (ie.
get hit) than it is in later levels.

Divination is a skill at which most new players neglect.  It's easy to do.
However, Ben is definitely correct in saying your Abj. is a bit low.
Though, it really does depend on what your primary roll has been.. though
you still should get this up.

<claps>  That is an outstanding Track and Sense Heading for a new player.
These are FAR too often neglected, or at least the Sense Heading.  Many
"uber" guilds require not only to know the zone and being very familiar with
using /loc, but, also having a maxed Sense Heading.  Though, "uber" guilds
aside, you want this skill as high as it can go.  Nice to see you are
working on your Forage as well.  This is a crucial skill when you get a
little "older."  No spoilers here, you'll find out (or already know). :)

There are places to go to work your swimming up without dying (eg. drowning)
while doing so unattended.  Check places such as Freeport, where the water
is shallow, but in places just deep enough to "swim."

Gold Jasper then Forest Loops without a doubt.  I've recently been PLing my
Enchanter (yet another one, different server) with my Druid (two accounts,
yep, I'm hard core addict) in Frontier Mountains for two levels and have
seen only 1 drop of the 200+ my chanter and partnering Warrior have killed.
Don't get discouraged though.  Even if you don't have one drop while you are
there (or loss the roll on one), you'll still be well on your way to making
money from the raw pp and/or other goodies the giants drop.  Again, still
working your way up to porting stage.

Or, keep doing the quest of which you have the first or three parts of and
get yourself the nice amulet with a permenant "see invis."  Though, the
Black Alloy's are nice without a doubt, much better than what I had to
settle with from that place. <grin>

Finance his wife?  Ack.  I've dipped 4k into jewelcraft of my (current) 34
Enchanter and that was recycling the successes, this only worked me up to
202.  I cant even imagine.

Silver and Ruby Ben. :)  4STR/4WIS Veil.  I would have to say go with a
player-made (either your wife once she is up to that level or someone else)
7STR/7WIS Veil.

What I'll do time to time if I'm trying to figure out how to equip a
"twink," is to go to

http://www.eqprices.com

What I do here is use the selections available (ie. Item, Race, Class, etc)
then I go from there to get an idea of what is available.  Note:  I
do -=not=- refer to this site for pricing.  I refer to the current market
value (not price, value) for this, on the server that I am playing on at the
time.  I wouldn't suggest spending hours in your servers "market place"
zone, though, sometimes it may be necessary to get the "great" deals.

Aye.  In fact, hopefully before you read this you have gone to the GM events
to get in on some good items.  The belt is outrageously nice (I'm rather
shocked they allow a DRU to wear it in fact) for such an easy kill -or- an
easy go over to corpse and loot.

Perhaps I missed this, though, what is your Deity?  As well as Race/Class?

Evil Eyes are EVIL.  They can be down right nasty.  See about getting a
group together to fight the Ogre's in the Karanas.  They've been known to
drop nice wrist items.  In fact they are only the STR away from being Runed
Mitrhil Bracers.

Nice work indeed.  These drop off a nasty (at your level) brownie (druid) in
Lesser Faydark.  You'll probably be wearing these for a very long time. :)

Foreman's Tunic.  Runs only like 100pp on my main play server.  10 AC, 3 WIS
and 3 STR... and it's weightless.


>

Kunzar Cloak.  It seems these are left to rot (more less) on servers
anymore.  You could probably talk your way to one of these for only 50-75pp.
Again, this really does depend on which server you play on.

Kunzar Cloak - 7 AC 2 INT 2 WIS 10 SV FIRE

If you cannot find one of these for extremely cheap (ie. the price range I
listed above) then wait just a lil longer and head on over to Crystal
Caverns and try your luck at obtaining a:

Cloak of the Ry'gorr Oracles - 6 AC 2 INT 2 WIS 10 MANA 10 SV COLD 5 SV
MAGIC

> > Feet   Studded Boots AC5
> > Haven't seen any wis leggings or boots for sale.
>
> Save up for Eboots, coldain skin or cultural tailored

Cultural Tailored boots.  Seems you are currently working on a budget, so go
with either that, or once you get to around 30ish and you are fighting in
Crystal Caverns, try your luck eventually with getting some:

Crystal Lined Slippers - 5 AC 3 INT 3 WIS

Note: Cultural Tailored would be things such as Imbued Vale Studded Boots.
Though, no idea what your deity is. :(

Again here, Cultural Blacksmithed weapons can be good and cheap.  If you
decide to venture to Great Divide, be cautious and constantly con mobs.

For damage (porcupining, which will come later) I would suggest a Black
Enameled Mace.

WTG!  Starshine is a pain to camp.  I've camped him atleast 10 times now
with lower levels, either guildies or not.  If I'm in the mood to get away
from the exp grind though still wish to log in the game, I will log with my
Druid and help a lower level get their page needed.  Granted, I usually let
them get down to about a quarter health and I slowly heal them.  This way it
was a total gimmie, as some people honestly do like to try on their own, or
atleast with as little help as possible.

>

No real upgrade for the range slot as far as WIS is concerned, or atleast
without spending the big money (ie. 2-5kpp).


You're doing really well given the finances available.  Remember, that
leveling for any new player is the best way to get yourself to better
equipment for your "main" or twinks you either have or may have in the
future.  You could even do what many have done, but only a few have become
extremely successful at.. and thats a market merchant or a "pawn" shop
owner. ;)  Buy low, sell high.  Though, sitting in EC/Gfay all day isn't
fun... trust me.  I've done it to where I was within the top 10 "richest"
folk on a particular server.. and well.  That's why I moved to another one.
Hehe.  This will probably give away who I was on that server, but, I traded
10k on that server for 2k on the one I started up on after that one... (on
three different servers now)... then gave the other 600k away.  <shrug>  I
will say this, I made many a newbies happy.  Though, now I'm diverting from
the subject.

All in all, you're doing well.  Ben made all good suggestions and I honestly
would follow them and hopefully something I might have added.  Take care.
