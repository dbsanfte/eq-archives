 I don't like them either. My problem is that I only see spell effects
for the spells that got "upgraded". Those NOT having new spell effects
are completely without any visible effects. 
 
 I've screwed around with the options quite a bit and I find no way
whatsoever to get my old spell effects back. I am not liking this at
all.
