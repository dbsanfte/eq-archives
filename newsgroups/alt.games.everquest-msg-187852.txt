Sounds like you'v got unlucky on the drops. You've done the merchant and
killing loads of targets things and you need to continue doing this but
also try regular (but not annoyingly so) /oocs to the zone asking if
anyone has seen them or has one spare - newbie quest items are the kind of
thing many people are prepared to share. If you are in a popular zone then
vendor mining is going to need a lot of cash to dig out the items from the
back of the merchants stock so this might be why you are not seeing any
despite others finding and selling them.
