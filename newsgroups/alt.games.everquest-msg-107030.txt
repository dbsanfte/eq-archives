I haven't seen anyone on this thread shouting that that's what's being
asked for.  I *have* seen one person on this thread asking for it (and
rez as well).

You got the wrong guy, lady :)  I've been there, albeit in small.  My
little 47 druid went on Vox raids and felt really pretty useless.  

But look.  You really can't argue that druid 1 to 50 is cake.  Easiest
class bar none at those levels.  Where we may differ is the amount of
importance that should be attached to that.

Try playing a rogue to 50, or a wizzie.  The mega oober posters here
would have you believe that nothing below 60 matters that much, but I
say they're full of it and not at all representative of the EQ
community at large.  1 to 50 is a substantial investment of time
unless you are so totally twinked and connected that you could get any
class up there in 12 hours or something, in which case I don't think I
really want to know you.

To get back to the petition (what a concept!), IMO there was too much
asked for.  Had they confined themselves to one request, I might have
found it easier to swallow.
