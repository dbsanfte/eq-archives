I am lvl 38 Ogre Shammy visiting Eastern Wastes.  I found the Gy'Goor Keep
in the middle of the zone which Crystal Caverns is located.  There are walls
all around the keep.  There is a one entrance but it is guarded by dark blue
KOS guard.  Is the entrance to CC inside?  Is there a way to get there
without going through the guards?  I am afrade all the mob inside the keep
are KOS on me.  How about Coldain Town?  Are they KOS to Ogre?

Emilio
