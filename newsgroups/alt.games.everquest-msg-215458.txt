Just in case you don't know, you can get some items that will help
tremendously without giving you more wis or mana.
Affliction efficiency items will lower the cost of DOT spells by 25%, and
affliction haste will speed up the casting times, burning affliction adds
some damage to DOTs, and there's a questable right-click manafree root
necklace (Warden Symbol of Tunare). Elder Spiritist's Vambraces & Elder
Spiritist's Gauntlets arent useable till you hit level 45 but then theyll
give you a manafree dot & snare to add to your root.

Another great item is the Fine Antique Ring (10% mana preservation on all
your spells), costs around 60-90 plat to buy the parts in the bazaar, and
takes 2 minutes to do the quest in the plane of knowledge.
