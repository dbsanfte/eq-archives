When I said "whole countries" I was trying to refer to how a whole slew 
of countries are voting it in as their official operating system for the 
governments.  That list is just going to grow and grow.  I think it will 
be something like the metric system though:  all the other countries 
will be using it profusely but North America will be using its own 
seperate standard since Windows has such a strong foothold here.  
Already Linux has a 30% growth rate and Windows is at 25% (but Windows 
is starting off from a very huge user base so catch-up will take quite 
some time).
