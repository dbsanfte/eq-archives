You might want to try a hybrid instead of a warrior. I'm having great fun
with my paladin; the 2/3 warrior, 1/3 cleric setup is a pretty good combo.
It solos well at 17 and I don't expect that to change soon. I've only played
a warrior up to 9th level, but that was enough for me to realize that zero
magic is a huge hassle. My friend with his 18th level warrior complains
frequently about how life sucks for him if/when he can't group. Unless
you're extremely tired of casting, you probably don't want a warrior.

As far as race goes, I've seen a large number of ogre/troll corpses near
good-aligned guards. You need to get to a level where you can kill guards
(and this will not work in places where there are too many, like Qeynos), or
else embark on genocidal rampages to get your faction up. Barbarians start
way off in the boonies, but they have everything they need right there, and
they are not KOS to any of the good races.  You could work with an ogre or
troll warrior, but my two cents is that it would just be too hard for too
long. Then again, I suppose I'm biased, having spent all my game time
hanging out with gooders.

Playing a warrior will definitely give you the opposite face of the coin.
You're tired of flinging heals, now be the guy who needs them constantly. I
