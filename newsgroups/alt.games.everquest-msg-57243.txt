It was on the PvP servers for about one day, then the emergency patch
shut it off.  It was mayhem.  I hope they don't restore it on the PvP servers
in the form it was.  It was probably fun to be a monster, but not a low-
to mid-teens player.  Too much opportunity to let a monster player's
"true nature" show through.
