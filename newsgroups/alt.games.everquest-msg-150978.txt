Gore is an enviromental whacko . He also is against nuclear power . This
shows his complete lack of knowledge about physics and chemistry.

Gore seems to me to be anti capitalist anti propert rights. We live in the
country with the greatest economy the world has ever seen built on a scant
200 years.  This shows his complete lack of knowledge about economics and
sociology.

Gore seems to be under the impression that men with calculators are or even
could be more exact than a computer at counting . This shows his complete
lack of knowledge about engineering and computer science.

The question is not whether Gore is an idiot, it is what type of idiot is
he.
