Hmm well I don't know what features you used that you can't now, but I
was just on it and can still find items and quests by zone, quests,
equipment by search, etc. Essentially everything I ever did I still
can.

Okay I just noticed that suddenly equipment by zone is not a regular
service. Quests by zone still are though.

I think doing this is kind of moot. It has been shown by other sites
that people simply don't pay for content on the web if it is basically
free player submitted content. People really don't even pay for
ORIGINAL content on the web. This is not going to save his site and he
is not going to get many premium memberships. Really you need
something value added, like how several people have said he could sell
the whole site in a useable cdrom form for a couple bucks then people
would perhaps even buy a new one a couple months later.

Going from using things from a site which were free, to going pay for
them especially sticks in user's craws.

I would not pay then if I were you. I feel the exact same way. It is
almost a moral issue to me. As I said before paying only makes sense
if its really value added with original content. 

Basically the only original content on the internet I would pay for
are big subscription semi perm growing character games like Everquest.
I would not pay for a non perm character game (like starcraft or quake
3 or something) via subscription but there again the perm character
game gives you added value.
