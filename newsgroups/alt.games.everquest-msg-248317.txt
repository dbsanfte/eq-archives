   This has been the topic of many discussions in this newsgroup over the
last few years.

    EQ seems less populated for a couple or reasons, in all probability. 
It is much bigger than it was when it started, and now there are instanced
zones.  People are simply more spread out than they used to be.  This fact
makes it harder to judge just how high or low the population of the servers
are now.  I remember when one could zone into LoIO and get a pretty good
idea of how many people were on.  Now it is rare to see more than 3 or 4
people in that zone.  Still, I also think that EQ is actually losing
numbers now, and that will only get worse when WoW/EQII comes out.

  Is the game dying?  That is the big question, of course.  I personally
think not.  EQ is a juggernaut in the universe of MMORPGs.  There are older
games that never had the numbers that EQ does, but are still around in a
diminished, but steady state.  EQ might itself diminish.  Servers might be
collapsed.  The churning out of expansion packs might slow then stop.  The
introduction of changes to game mechanics through patches might trickle
down to nothing.  But as long as there is a measurable profit to be had,
then they won't pull the plug on the last server.  And I think that it will
take years before that happens.  I don't have a crystal ball of course, but
I have a strong feeling that if you care to be around EQ for its 10th or
15t anniversaries, then you will be able to do so.   But you might not have
alot of company when you do.

   Are players moving to other MMORPGs?  Yes.  Will they stay with them or
come back to EQ?  Probably a little of both.  Will more new players join
than the number of old players who leave and don't come back?  This is the
big question, the question that SOE really needs to be interested if it
wants EQ to survive in its current state.  And the signs seem to suggest to
me that they don't expect that to happen.  Fixing the basic game code and
stability so that users don't get frustrated and move on would be a
priority to them, I would think, if they really thought that EQ
could/should be preserved in its glory.  Instead, it looks as though they
are more interested in getting a much money from the player base in the
form of expansion and to a lesser extent character transfers/name changes
before the game implodes into a few die hard players who would never leave
until the last server goes down and never comes back.
