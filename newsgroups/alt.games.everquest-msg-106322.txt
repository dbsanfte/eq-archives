I just turned 29.  Ported all over to find my "circle" spells - finally got
them, gated back to LOIO where I am bound to log for the night.  Some guy is
begging for a port... I ignore it because I am beat and ready for bed.  So he
finds me... runs over and begs.  He's not on a CR, just wants to get to NK. 
And he's an iksar.
So I agree.  Get it memmed and away we go.  He lands before me.  I get there to
find him getting his ass kicked by the druids. I never even THOUGHT about that.
Know I can't help or they'll agro me.  He dies.
Great.
So now I'm doing a /ooc for a rez.  Spend 20 minutes and finally find a guy to
do it - pally, 10%, very relieved.  Drag body all the way to wizie spires then
up to EK bridge.  Rezzer shows up, bless his heart, does the rez.  *I* give the
rezzer 10 plat, since I always donate for such things, and thats all I have
left after buying my spells.  Now iksar wants me to run him all the way to
RUNNYEYE.  He never even donates for the port.  So I waste an hour on this
asshole AND it costs ME money... Well I've learned something from this
experience.  I told him no and logged off.  What a jerk.
Thanks for letting me vent...
