I am cool. The response wasn't serious.

You've actually come to a point that so many others seem to have
missed. Ask yourself why I'm being flamed (originally) in this thread
- because I get annoyed when they give me a canned response.

However, no one thought to actually ask how I respond. Well, someone
did but it was lost in the clutter.

No, I don't call him an incompetant fuck. (I do out loud)

No, I don't berate him for using a canned response.

I ask him if he read the petition.

That has worked every time. They start addressing the petition and
stop being a mindless answering machine not listening to me.

Not quite as evil as those dying to flame me assumed, hmm?
