Actually, I think mage/shaman would be a kick ass duo. The advantages go
without sayin if you both have even one clue on how to play your class.
They could do quite well together.

As to where? High twenties to low thirties the two of you could *very*
easily hold down the gnolls on the hills behind the gnoll spires in SK,
just outside of the Paw entry.  Once you get to the low/mid thirties,
the two of you could move to Great Divide and do dire wolves (and later
frost giant scouts) for quite a few levels after that.  You might also
take a crack at Crystal Caverns of the first floor of ToFS at that
level. I think you could handle it if you're careful and gain better xp
and cash to boot.
