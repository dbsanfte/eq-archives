No, I expect the whole thing to be set up better.

I expect when I log in for the system to tell me whats going on. 
Servers down for a patch.  Servers up but locked for testing.  Servers up.

Not "you can't log in its probably because of a patch in progress" which 
is the message you get in any of the above three  cases if, in the 
latter case, congestion is preventing you from getting in.

These three cases, down, up but locked, up, are the only three cases I'm 
interested in, how hard would it be to automate a status report into the 
log in procedure?

IF for some reason thats impossible, then they should at a minimum be 
using their existing server status page to communicate, oh, I dunno, 
this sounds wacky, but.... the server status.

Its currently almost doing that, its reporting up and down.  Better than 
it used to be.  But its pretty much useless when it comes to telling me 
whether its time to start trying to break thru the logjam of congestion 
or not, because up but locked and up and running are polar opposites, 
both with the same page.

OK, so I'm told that for some unknown reason the people running that 
page are too lazy or incompetant to do that, and that instead they use 
the watercooler to officially communicate in an informal way.  Cool.  Do 
they communicate it there? NO they don't

Server status page goes from Down to Up.  Nows the key time to 
communicate whats going on.  Change the message from "we guess 5 hours" 
to "we're now testing, servers will be locked for another half hour 
unless things develop" or "ok we're up and running, go log in"

Not the case.  Far as I can tell,  your only hope of finding out is to 
hope some player who logs in will report it to the forum...

Which is exactly how I used to get the info here on this newsgroup, 
backchannel all the way, baby.

But I don't think its a professional way to do things.
