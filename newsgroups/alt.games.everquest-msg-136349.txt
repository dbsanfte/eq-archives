That is theft. And, you are likely to get
prosecuted for it. 

Picking up an item in EQ is not the same at all.
While we are dealing with bad analogies, how about
manna falling from heaven?

How persistent should he have been in trying to
find the person that dropped it?

Should he have handed the items into a police
station and let them deal with it, as you might
with a wallet?

Its not theft though... more like serendipity.
