You don't.  It sounds like you're in the default Windowed mode.  Windowed
mode only allows for 640x480 resolution.  Oh, you CAN stretch the monitor
but you're not gaining anything at all.

Increasing the resolution only helps when you're playing in Full Screen mode
(hit F10...and you can be in FS by default if you change a line in
eqclient.ini...take a look there's a couple other options as well), but when
you hit F10 to get back to Windowed mode that window will be small again.

EQ's coming out with a new interface in the next couple months
(guestimate...they said "soon," but who knows what that means :) ) which
will hopefully make the Windowed mode totally obsolete and you won't have to
deal with this anymore.
