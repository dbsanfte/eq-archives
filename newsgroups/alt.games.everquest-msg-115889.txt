heh mostly not druids. I know of only one other druid beside mine that has
7th shawl. On the other hand the spawn rate in western wastes for animals is
2 hrs . Kill a placeholder and 2 hrs later there is about a 1 in 5 chance
for a wolfie to spawn. Overall figure maybe 20 people total per server
trying to start 8th shawl and a normal start up of 5 wolfies in western
wastes about 1 in 4 dropping fur. Not hard at all to see that hound furs are
rare.

I wont even start 8th shawl for a couple of monthes just to let people clear
out a bit . Funny thing is I already had 4 velium hound furs and 6 blocks of
velium on a storage twink. I am back to hunting acrylia ore atm since I have
a 100 or so flawless rockhopper hides to burn up raising tailoring.
