    You want an interesting bug with keyrings? Check out how they coded
them: in part, the same as the "chat buffers" that remember who sent you
tells. You know how you can camp over to a different character, and "r"
whoever was talking to you before? Well, by extension....

    Enter someplace with a key. Camp over to a second character you want to
enter the zone without going out further than character select. The system
thinks the second character has the key on their keyring, too. So as long as
one of your characters has a key to area X, and you can get all your
characters to the doorway in one session, all of your characters can zone
into area X.

    No, I don't know if it saves the keyring for characters that didn't
actually have the key. Yes, I hope this gets removed promptly. The thought
of people in my guild moving rothound characters into Vex Thal makes me ill.
