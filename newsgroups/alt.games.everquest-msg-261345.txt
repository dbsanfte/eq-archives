I'm not saying they do (although they did spend the same 30 bucks on the 
expansion as everyone else, so maybe the virtual lock out is a little 
unfair.)

At any rate, someone can't say "You haven't seen half the zones in PoP 
and GoD yet! You don't need a new expansion that caters to you... you 
have lots to do already!!"

And my point is that all this content they haven't seen isn't worth a 
hill of beans because they will -never- see it as its currently 
designed, so YES, they DO need new expansions directed at them.
