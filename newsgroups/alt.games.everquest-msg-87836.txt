   I find it amusing that the original guy who 
took exception to my use of the word "celibate" 
to mean sexual abstinence did so, apparently, 
because I was using the _wrong_ dictionary
definition.  I don't have the OED on my desk,
though I am certainly familiar with this very
famous and respected work.  I have the paperback
version of Webster's New World Dictionary.  It
is _not_ as good of a dictionary as the OED.
But is it a mainstream dictionary, not one
of those "slang" or joke dictionaries one can
encounter.  I do actually use this dictionary
from time to time as I post.  I did not look
up the word "celibate", but if I had I would
have seen that it gives the definition "1 an
unmarried person 2 one who abstains from 
sexual intercourse --adj. of or in a state of
celibacy".
    The usenet is a literary medium.  I feel 
that its an important reflection on oneself 
to post in a coherent manner, using proper
spelling, grammar, and punctuation.  I suppose
I fail on all three accounts upon occasion, 
but I do make an effort to post cleanly.
    So...was I right to describe myself as
being celibate?  By definition 1 then certainly
not.  I have been happily married for over
15 years, and have every reason to expect that
I will remain so until one of us dies.  If we
were to go by definition 2 however, I was 
right on.  As long as my husband is in another
state from me then sexual intercourse is
an impossibility.  Hence, I abstain.  For
reasons that have nothing at all to do with
religious beliefs, true, but then _my_ dictionary
makes no mention of the motivation's impact upon
the use of the word.
   By the OED I may not have used the word 
correctly, though I certainly feel that one
could make a strong case that I did.  But
my real amusement stems from marveling at
the guy who sent this thread careening on 
its present course.  If my use of the word
"celibate" was bothersome to him, can you
imagine the epic proportions of gut wrenching
irritation he must experience _every single time
he uses the usenet_ !?
