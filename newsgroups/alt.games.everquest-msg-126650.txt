So I can't find a clear comparison of various mana regeneration
rates.

How much Mana per tic come from

Meditation at a given skill level (or is it character level?)
Sitting
Standing
special: Bard mana; none of the below will help, does sitting
versus standing have any effect?

Breeze
Clarity
Clarity II
Clarity III
Various Necro lich type spells

Protection of the Glade (or cabbage)
Blessed Armor of the Risen
Other similar self only mana regen buffs

Flowing Thought (do these items stack?  Whats the
relationship between level and effect?  One point per,
per tic?)

The necro group mana steal buff... does it conflict with
any of the above, or with the bard soothing line?

and the area I'm most interested in at the moment

Cantana of Soothing (does level change this?  String skill?
String instrument quality?)
Cantana of Replentishment (same questions)
Chorus of Replentishment (same)

As far as I know those are everything sorted into stack
conflict areas... the final area are all items that have
no stack conflicts but work when triggered or
cast or sung.

Mod Rod 1
Mod Rod 2
Canna 1
Canna 2
Canna 3
Canna 4
Various necro mana feeds
Cassindra's chant of clarity (do Voice instruments like bard epic help?
How about Amplification?  Level or sing skill?)
Cassindra's chorus of clarity (same)

Is that every mana regen issue in the game?
