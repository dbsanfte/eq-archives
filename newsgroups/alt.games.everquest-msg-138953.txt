For what you do, Lokari (client-side GUI apps), yes.  Java is all over
the place for server-side and middleware, where its slow startup and
memory piggishness are much less of an issue.  It's probably more
popular than C at this point, certainly for new apps.

I'd put Java as better than C/C++ for a first language, because it
eliminates a whole class of pointer-related crashes, which can be
very hard to track down for a novice programmer.
