Its an ongoing puzzle to be sure, noone has a high level Vah Shir, and
even the mid range ones haven't gotten there without serious twinking
and powerleveling help, so we don't really know much about their
capabilities and needs.

Still, look at your more normal pet classes... they use mana to summon
up a pet, but after that don't tend to use it much to maintain the pet.
Their mana is consumed in doing damage.

My thinking is that Beastlords do damage via melee instead of by
casting spells, which would mean even less mana consumption than
a regular pet class; invest in getting that pet buffed up, and then
go in and hack away, with 4 arms working at the project instead
of two, and two HP sponges available to soak up the damage
instead of one.

I've seen high level shaman soloing this way, I think more than
anything this is the model for the beastlord, forget thinking
about them as monk somethings, since the defining ability of
the monk is Feign Death... think of them as more melee oriented
shaman with better pets.

If mana is used pre fight or post fight, then the size of the pool
isn't really relevant.  Lets say you have a pool 200 mana deep,
and a spell that costs 200 mana. Cast it, med up 200 mana
worth, cast it again, med up 200 mana again.  Or you have
a pool 400 mana deep.  Cast spell twice, med twice as long.
Net result the same...

I did this with my druid twink, had 200 wis and a huge pool
of extra mana items... turns out I could indeed kill reds that
way, but had to med up 6 minutes between them.  Since there
is no other important stat for a druid, that didn't really limit
his effectiveness in any way, but it seems to me that a beastlord
should benefit from melee stats a lot more than from wisdom....

Of course a week from now someone is going to find a
"killer ap" strategy that requires a mana oriented sit on your
butt strategy... the old "let the pet do the work" necro fear
kite trick comes to mind.. but I sort of hope not, as to me
the idea for the class is pet plus melee...

level 6 beastlord, 29 tailoring... cursing the fact that we can't
make leather padding!
