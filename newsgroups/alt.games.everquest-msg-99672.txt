So then why forge ahead and make the slur anyway?  There's
no excuse, Scott.  If you "didn't believe it", or at
least didn't want to introduce suspicions about me, then there
would have been no good reason for you to say it at all.

If I didn't know better, it sounds like you are a child molester.

Gosh, no reason to take offense, since the first half of
that sentence "means that I believe otherwise", eh?  So you'd
be a fool to object to me saying that, right?  It's a perfectly
innocent statement, one that would be acceptable in polite
conversation, eh?

"Chain Smoker" also took your statement as an accusation,
so if there's a miscommunication, it's on the writer's
end, not the readers'.

Don't be obtuse, Scott -- "If I didn't know better" is a common
rhetorical device which is used not to disclaim what follows,
but to sling it as a suspicion.  It's a coy, sarcastic way of 
making a charge while simultaneously attempting to distance
yourself from it.  It's the coward's way of namecalling.

Why bother?  Because you might want to demonstrate some 
honor and integrity.

Silly me, it appears you don't have any.  You chose
to raise suspicions about me being the perpetrator
of a lame scam, and yet you don't have the decency
to retract it.  Fine -- you've made your character
quite clear.

And speaking of "misreading", Scott, go back and reread the
part of my post that you took as an "x 3 insult" -- it
was actually a blunt request for an explanation of your
behavior, specifically so that I'd know the reason for your
unprovoked personal insinuation, and thus, as I explained,
help me to know how to properly interpret your future missives.

Well, my question has now certainly been answered, although
not in the way you intended, and now I'll know how to 
treat you in the future.  

Because "if I didn't know any better", I'd think that 
you were a shameless weasel who makes unfounded personal
slurs and then refuses to own up to them.
