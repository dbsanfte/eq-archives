It's pretty standard to partition your drive.  I've got mine split
into a 2GB Windows partition, a 1.5GB EQ partition, and a few other
partitions for various purposes (my 4 CD drives end up as W to Z).

Recommendation is that you put all programs onto other partitions, and
keep minimal material on the Windows partition.  That way, it doesn't
change structure very often, and defragging will keep it running fast
& easy.

I REALLY, REALLY suggest you purchase a copy of Partition Magic.  It's
a *great* program for hard drive partitioning and restructuring.
