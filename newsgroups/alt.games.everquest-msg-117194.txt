hi guys its me again now my paladin is 18th level and doing fine

i have finally ventured to befallen and that is a great place to work on my
death ward or as someone told me my "nuke" spell i feel i have and unfair
advantage there but hey the xp is good :)

my story so far im now in a guild the legend of the forsaken which is cool
as they are prety helpful as it took them ages to teach me the "who GUILD
all" command apparently i was not putting the / in front and all it came up
was "you say to your guild: all" but they were really patient as it took me
like 5 mins to finally get it right. and there were other embrassing
situations like my first time being a tank and everyone told me to bind "INC
%t" but when they said put a t next to the % i thought it was INC percentt
or INC percent%. ghee i felt stupid but everyone was supportive. so i really
like the community i have never meet anyone bad yet :).

but im really getting into the role playing like i see myself is a last
defender character who always goes down to let the others live.  and i made
a whole heap of binds like:

my heroic phrase
"run you fools Dareydiel looks back to the %t(which means the monster im
looking at) and shouts You shall not pass!"

my need healing phrase
"my friends, i would surely die if i do not get aid soon"

my incoming phrase
"i have lured a %t to his doom"

when i use death ward for added effect
"I call on the power of Mithaniel Marr BEGONE %t"

my low on mana or oom phrase
"The essence of my God is weakening I must pray to Mithaniel Marr for more"

my thanks for buffs and general thank you phrase
"I thank you kind soul may Mithaniel Marr bless you on your journeys"

i guess your thinking im getting carried away but it prolly cause i play
AD&D and i really like to role play (maybe i should go on FV server?) but i
was wondering do you guys do this? do you guys play it like a game or play
it like an actor i dont know if im making sense but i just like to get some
ideas for other cliche fantasy sayings :)

also the other day i saw a high level necro in action and i must say im
starting to think being a paladin is a wrong choice. also where do you get
cool magic items all my stuff comes from buying at auctions the only magicl
thing i found was lockjaw leather armour and i did kill it just looted the
croc i dont want to spend ages killing some pathetic weakling monster (in
this case camping orcs to get deathfist belts to sell for 4 plat each) to
make money to buy awesome equipment. when i imagine my paladin i think she
goes on grand adventures fighting monstrosities of evil to gain a magical
item, but all her adventuring is in haggling with a merchant in a zone next
to her starting city for a good price on the  magical item hardly heroic, im
18th level  i must be high enough to be a hero now right?

well thats my rant will tell when im level 22 of the adventures of my
character :)

bye
thanks for reading
Thach Nguyen
