They seem to be on a random spawn cycle with everything else... Don't
know for sure, though. NK definately isn't the prime spot to find
HG's, though. But the crowds in Rathe Mts make that an annoying place
to hunt them, too...

Level 32, huh? Only hunting them with KEI, I assume? Given that most,
if not all, of them are still red to you at 32...
