Hello all!

This might be a too often ask question for all the regulars on this ng but
if any of you can help, I would really appreciate. If you know a website
that discuss this please tell me (I,ve been to steelwarrior.org but did not
really found what I was lf)

Here's the question:

Dwarf warrior, level 21....

I got 4 weapons and would like to know what the best combo would be for my
level and what it will be as I level.

1 wurmy
1 centi ss
2 lammy

I currently use the 2 lammy and am able to keep / gain aggro easily plus the
skills sure go up fast. Also, when do dam bonuses start and what does it
look like as the char level.

Thanks all for your help.
