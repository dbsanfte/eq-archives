Look at your resists of your character stats.  Now pay attention to what
resist modifiers on equipment and since you are having issues with poison
effects, watch for equipment that adds to that stat that you can use.  That
gives you a goal in equipment.

As far as stuns, the main defense is to have your stamina stat as high as
possible.  You'll always get stunned sometimes, but higher stamina helps
minimize that.
