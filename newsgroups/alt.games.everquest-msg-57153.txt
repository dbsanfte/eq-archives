Just a few of my thoughts and findings about lag on the new Antonius-Bayle
server.

When I logged in after the patch yesterday, everything was perfect for me,
the first time ever in EQ, no lag, zero loss. That lasted for a few hours,
then the lag started to hit, sort of expected after a patch on a new server,
but disappointing after there was zero lag to begin with. There were various
in game GM announcements about lag problems to Germany, I am in the UK btw.
I'm not sure if they "tweaked" anything on the server, but I was getting
permanent 30-40% loss, not good!

So of course I did what every sane and normal person would do, I logged to
the chat server to bitch about it, lol. Of course that didn't actually do
anything, except made me feel a little better that I had made my feelings
known.

After about 20 minutes on chat, I decide to log back in and see if the lag
had improved. Wonder of wonders, lag was back to zero once again, even with
150+ people in GFay at the time. Now that is a nice feeling after playing
for 18 months on MT with constant low lag, makes it feel worthwhile that I
moved, even if I did leave many very good friends behind.

It may be co-incidence, but if anyone else is getting major lag on AB, it
may be worth a quick relog to see if anything improves.
