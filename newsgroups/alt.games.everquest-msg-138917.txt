No Item loss on death from PvP. All they get is your cash, provided you had
any on you to begin with, I make it a point to be competely broke as often
as possible ;)  Also, no Exp loss from PvP deaths.

As to the wandering packs of PvP'ers. Ive not seen that. Sure, its a rough
existance in the beginning, especially in some of the more contested zones.
I picked up a DEEP seated hatred for Pecks ( specifically Azzlings, and
Grubs ( gnomes ) ) due to getting ganked more than once while trying to
peacefully level in Crushbone.

Once you get to about level 20 though things really quiet down. Kyrrana used
to get picked on unmercifully ( Pecks once again : P ) , but in the last 10
levels Ive only been in PvP combat once and that person, yet again another
Peck, got schooled badly ;)

If you LIKE the pvp aspet then EC, right around the Nek Forrest zone is a
good place to "hunt". I had my little baby Shaman ( Troll natch ) out there,
and was having a good old time with a Wood elf rogue. I lost the battle but
made the rogue pay for it in blood ;)

The thing you have GOT to learn is to NOT take it personal. Sure, theres a
fair amount of jerks on the server ( Vallon zek is where I play ), and those
jerks CAN affect your gameplay a lot more than on a Blue server, but Ive
NEVER given any of the dweebs the satisfaction of a reply back to any of
thier taunts, and for the most part they leave when they realize theyre not
going to get a response.

Anyways those are my thoughts on playing on a Zek server.
