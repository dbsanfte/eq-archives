Hi all,

Is there a formula to find out how much damage a weapon will do?  i.e.  I
have a dagger that lists 10 as damage.  My strength is 140 and my piercing
skill is 93.  How does that translate to the 20-25 damage I usually do with
it?  If I find another dagger with 15 as damage will I only do 25-30?
Thanks for any help.
