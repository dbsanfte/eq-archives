Sticking with the concept of Norrath being a round world, this would be a good
idea *if* the next logical destination heading west was Steamfont. Or at least
an ocean front with a boat leaving for there.
BUT!  as per a recent discussion and some comments from Brad, it seems that
there is one more continent left on Norrath betwen Odus and Feydwer which has
not yet been "dicovered".
