Only if the algorithm were *extremely* straightforward, which it clearly is
not in EverQuest.  Let me illustrate.

This is just an example.  With each swing, let's say you're given a 50%
chance to hit something.  When you do hit something, let's say you can hit
anywhere from 1 to 10 in damage.  So, out of 10 swings, you will do an
average damage amount of: 27.5 damage ((n|n-1|) * 0.5).  If you increase
your attack speed by 20%, in 10 swings you will average 38.5 damage, an 40%
increase in damage output.

Now, that very simple example shows a difference of 20% between attack speed
increase and damage output.  EverQuest certainly has a few more variables
thrown in, and the damage ranges are typically much higher, so you can see
that the numbers can really get far apart from each other.
