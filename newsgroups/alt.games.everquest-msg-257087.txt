I have clicky endure poison, endure cold, niether of which really worth 
worrying about, and lesser shielding, which gives me a small boost to my 
hp and AC if there's no shaman available, Spirit Strength, which boost 
my STR up which in turn boosts my DPS, absent someone with a str buff 
for me.
Then I have something more worthwhile; Skin like Steel, which gives me 
100 points higher HP total (not a big deal) and works as a 100 point 
heal if I reapply it.  Which I can do again and again, at no mana cost, 
healing roughly 4% of my hp total per click.  Sadly, this won't work if 
I have a better HP buff, depending on what I"m doing I often have 
Virtue, which nearly doubles my hp total and raises my AC a good bit.

So the best of the lot at the moment is Fungal Regrowth, which gives me 
an extra 15 hp per tic regen, but snares me while its running.  Its 
insta click, but I have to swap the staff into my hands, click it, and 
then swap my weapon back in.  At any rate, since its clicky and instant, 
I can dump it when I want to run, and put it back on mid fight; I pull 
without it on, put it on while fighting, off if I have to chase a runner 
(if snare isn't up yet or not sticking) and so on.

Not one of those clicky effects isn't outclassed by having a group mate 
cast real buffs on me, with the possible exception of the skin like 
steel thing; if I'm not the MT and healer mana is at a premium, me being 
able to take care of cleaning up the misc damage I take isn't a bad 
thing, mana free and all.
