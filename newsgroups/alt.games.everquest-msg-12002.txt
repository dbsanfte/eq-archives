>how is the max dmg of a backstab determined, and whats a good amount of 
>damage to be doing at 14?

The exact formula for backstab is unknown. Here is the section from the
safehouse rogue FAQ on the subject:
==========================================================
2.7.1 How is backstab damage calculated? 

Nothing is official, but the general belief is that at low levels, it works
something like this: Assuming that you are using a weapon deemed
'acceptable' for your level (i.e. not too powerful [some players report
getting very high level weapons at lower levels and not getting the damage
they were supposed to until they leveled some more]), max damage is
calculated as: (DMG * 2) + 1 Backstab simply multiplies this by a constant
factor. We approximate this factor to be:

           (BACKSTAB_SKILL / 25)

So a maxed level 10 rogue has a backstab multiplier of (55 / 25) = 2.2x.
 Assuming he's using a giant snake fang (DMG 5, so max damage (5 * 2) + 1 =
11), his level 10 max backstab will be (11 * 2.2x) = 24. Backstab damage
caps at 25 * DMG at level 50. Towards level 20, these numbers skew.
Backstab seems to top out for a time, and then go up rapidly in the higher
20s. Strength effects how often you hit for max damage, so be sure to have
STR enhancing equip and/or STR buffs on you as often as possible.

At 51st, the new minimum backstab damage is Level*3/2, rounded down. 76 is
the least you will hit for at 51st, and it goes up. At 60th, the minimum
backstab is Level*2 (120). 
============================================================

I believe the maximum damage possible at level 60, using whatever
combination of str, +atk items/spells, damage discipline and a 15 damage
weapon (usually the ragebringer) is 1022...500 with the ragebringer is kind
of the norm however (course, at L60, most of those will be double
backstabs, at 500 apiece).
