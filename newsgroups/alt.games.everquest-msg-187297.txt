Unless they happen to be playing an erudite, and happen to like
Chitlins.  Even if it were a "slur", there's no way you could tell what
the color of the person behind it, and if it were a slur.  This is
another stupid petition.

So if I made a gnome rogue and named him fried chickin, would that be a
racial slur as well?  I just so happen to think gnomes look like little
fried chicken bits...

Two very respected people on my server have food names, should they be
changed too?

"Minute Rice"
"Bakin Bits"
