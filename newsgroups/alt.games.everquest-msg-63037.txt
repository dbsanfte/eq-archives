Given the sheer lagfest that zone is, I doubt making a heal chain
longer would make things easier.  If anything, you just introduce more
potential screw ups.

No, but we also don't need 12 clerics with Donals.
Generally we have 5 to 6 clerics, no Donals and a dead Vyemm.

What the hell are you talking about?
In order for you to have enough "healing" with the Donals you would
need *TWICE* as many clerics since the CH on those pre-nerf BPs takes
two times the casting time!

If you have the warm bodies to wear those Donals and right click on it
with enough overlap to keep a tank alive, guess what?  You have MORE
than enough clerics there to kill Vyemm.

Vyemm takes a whopping 40 people these days.  You can't get 40 people
to show up for a ToVN clearing?  Are you shitting me?  I can't beat
people away with a stick!  ToVN == 20+ phat fucking lewts in one day's
clearing.  I get every semi-active member suddenly showing up and
staying logged on for 12+ freaking hours.

That's the problem isn't it?
It DOES NOT SCALE UP!

Have you actually tried this tactic?  I mean really attempt it against
a mob that can generate really sick amounts of damage very quickly.

We have.  It DOES NOT SCALE!

The lag is ALWAYS a factor.  Which end game mob encounter zone can you
name that doesn't have lag as a factor?

Kael?  ToVN?  PoG?  WW?  Skyshrine?  Icewell? 

All of these zones have lag and shitload of them.  

I'm speaking as someone who actually tried to make this work.  It
doesn't.  We had sufficient clerics, sufficient donals, and even MORE
than sufficient damage output.  Main tanks could not live the entire
encounter because the heal chain broke.  The best we ever managed with
the donal's chain was getting Velketor (and this is a fairly WEAK mob
compared to some of the tougher ones) to 40% using this before the
chain broke and basically killed everyone (main tank dies, clerics
follow almost immediately before another tank can gain aggro, but
since the clerics are busy trying to right click their stupid BP, the
new main tank can't POSSIBLY survive long enough to get the heal).

Also remember, pre-nerf Donals, once you right clicked that BP you
weren't interrupting it.  You basically was locked out of doing
anything for 20 seconds (30 seconds if you had the first nerf Donals).
If the main tank you were trying to heal dies, tough shit you couldn't
even retarget until the BP finished casting--that cleric was
effectively out of the chain for that 20 seconds.  That's a LONG
fucking time with some of these Velious ubers....

Tank transition is probably the single most critical time in any
encounter.  Even the initial engagement is easier to deal with than
transitioning to a new tank sometimes.  Anything that makes that
transition more difficult, thanks but no thanks.
