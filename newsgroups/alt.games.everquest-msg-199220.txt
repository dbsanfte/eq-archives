As a shaman, I have a distinct advantage, I slow the mobs, so that opens up 
ones a druid would have real difficulty with.  Also wearing chain probably 
helps some over leather.  DS potions, 32 point DS at my level, if I want to 
go to the trouble of making them make a big difference too (of course slow 
reduces their efficacy).  In addition, I don't have to worry about finding 
a suitable animal to charm, I summon a halfway decent pet to add to melee 
damage.  I can tank dark blue mobs (have to pick the right ones) at my 
level if I want to.
