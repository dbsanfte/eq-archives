Hehe, got smithing at 176, lost around 1500pp to get to 175 skill (powersmithed
instead of orders, wanted to get to FP armor, didnt feel like selling +200
cloaks), and the spend 2000pp to get from 175 to 176 skill, made a full set to
my newbie troll. Got most of the money back when selling, but guess i lost
around 2K on smithing so far, dont feel like spending more money on it.
Especially when the prices on my server are almost the same on crafted. Take WAY
too long to sell FP armor at material cost, its damn near impossible to sell it
with a profit.
