Tracking is only a marginal help in an assassinate mission.  The boss is
just not there to be tracked until you've killed enough to spawn him, and
after he's spawned you get regular updates on his position from the dungeon
itself.   The only advantage to having a tracker is that you don't have to
wait 3 minutes for the boss to "make noise" again.

In a rescue mission, it's a whole 'nother ballgame.   Trackers rock here, as
they can track the hostage immediately, and keep you from going down the
wrong path if the dungeon splits early.

And as a side note, I believe maps are now complete for all the LDoN zones.
The first multipack I downloaded had about half, with various others being
nothing but a few straight lines in the general outlay, and some completely
blank.  The pack I downloaded about a week ago has every dungeon (so far)
filled in.   '


Although it is all done in a horrible light yellow color, that is *very*
hard to read.  It takes me a while with the map tool to change it all to
black lines, but well worth it.  Does anyone know if there is a good way to
edit the text file directly and change this?  Or do you have to use the in
game map tool?

This is true.  IMO, slaughter are too easy, and due for a nerf.   If they
want to leave the system the way it is, slaughter missions should be bumped
up to 70 kills required, at least.
