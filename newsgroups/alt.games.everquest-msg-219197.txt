Hey folks.
I have been lurking for a couple of years and have come to realize most 
of you guys know your stuff. So I was hoping for a little help.

Starting today, when I try to start Everquest I get a Windows XP error 
that says "EverQuest.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close.  
We are sorry for the inconvenience." 

When I checked the Microsoft knowledgebase it basically said that EQ 
wasnt totally compatible with XP. I could not find any fixes on EQLive 
either.

I checked and everquest.exe in windows 98/ME compat mode. Even when 
taking it out of the mode I get the error.

Nothing has changed on my machine. No new software or hardware changes 
lately.

I am hopeing that I do not need to re-install EQ as I have misplaced my 
PoP CD's and would rather not have to purchase them again.

My Machine is:
Windows XP Home Edition
AMD Athlon XP 1800+ processor
256MB DDR Ram
Creative SB Audigy X-Gamer sound card
ATI Radeon 7000 serier video card

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
