yay!

want to come to FV? it's not a roleplay server anymore, it's a place where 
all that high-end gear you always dreamed can just fall into your lap 
(literally)

(for me, it makes it worthwhile to start from scratch when i literally have 
an empire on another server)

(and i won't bring it up again)

[snip]

if you've played a shaman and *loved* it, then playing another will actaully 
be great for you ... if , on the other hand, you think you might mind 
repeating it  .. don't bother

the shaman/mage duo would be very nice; the slows and buffs of shammy would 
let ol' flamey serve as a more viable tank overall ... plus, honestly, with 
good gear a shaman can tank (you know the details better than i)

and one last point ~ 2boxing with a mage is a no-brainer .. i mean, c'mon! 
mages! send pet, nuke! wee! (don't hit me, my g/f plays a mage, she'll hit 
me for you [all]) ... you *will* have the time/attention leftover to take 
full advantage of the shaman...especially if you do a canni macro

> BEASTLORD
>

3/4 of a shaman is a really big deal

> 3) Slows (decent)
> 4) Self-haste (?)

not till the high 50's...you'd probably be pet-cleric'ing anyway

so...beastlord pets beat mage pets, bl can slow, sow, and tank a little ... 
and if you just play pet cleric, your duo will do very well ... you'd only 
be mising snare (but you have 2 nukers) and crowd control (not to be taken 
lightly)

> ENCHANTER
>

you'd effectively be soloing your mage most efficiently =P

with a chanty's slows, that pet as a tank will work very well...tash won't 
be as big an issue until the higher ups anyway ... the main thing is the 
clarity and mez - you won't have to worry about adds (huge plus!) and you'll 
optimize the mage's output (which is all offense)

you can charm, too, though i wouldn't recommend it without a healer after 50 
(if you're boxing), but the chanty is mostly the defense that the mage so 
desperately needs

> NECROMANCER

necro is a great option ... no downside at all, except it'll make your mage 
seem pathetic ^_^

(i don't play a necro)

> SHADOWKNIGHT

oh come on, really? what would you even do? maybe if you said ranger, and 
you said you were planning on either twinking to all hell or fighting only 
animals (snare + panic animal), that'd be ok ... sk can snare/fear also, but 
it just isn't the same ... do the necro if you want that, or else level a 
3rd toon who can heal =P

you must really want to try the class out, since it's so misplaced to be 
mentioned here ... if you really want it, why not reroll the mage into a 
priest? (stick to cleric if you plan on duo'ing past 5o, i would say)

with /autofire, or whatever it is, a ranger might be a nice companion - 
they're a melee, so they can save you enough time to gate (then run the 
melee away), but with summoned arrows from the mage, you'll have damage 
forever (albeit not great damage)

with proper attention (potions/gear and the hurdles that come with them) a 
war / monk could effectively solo to 50, so having the mage there would make 
it faster ...

enchanter is really great to put with a mage, but you will find yourself 
hurting for DPS (plus enc's slow undermines mage's DS)

beastlord, if you don't mind my confidence, is perhaps the best partner for 
a mage, especially if you're playing on a low budget...you'd only be hurting 
on big pulls, and it might be a pain to be a pet-cleric and not a proper 
melee, but you could always develop that later when gear/cash becomes more 
free

necro is possibly better, possibly worse ... for the record, a necro CAN mez 
(not just undead), but not until 33 or 34, and the recast makes his mezzing 
capacity exactly 2 mobs ... and mobs under lvl 55 ... but it's there, and 
it's nice, and post-55 a necro can just solo all your adds =P

and shaman, if you loved the class, is the last option that pops out at me 
... the slow is good enough that it can work as its own crowd control (if 
you're clever)...but more than with the enchanter, you'll be hurting for dps
