KEI is about twice the mana regen of clarity, and lasts a base time of 150
mins. With items and abilities this can go up to about 4 hours. People
usually pay between 50 and 100 for it, unless they are newbies (under50).

Just about any mobs people would hunt at these levels would generate an
extra 50-100p of loot with all this extra mana, probably a lot more.
Unfortunately there are still some who think that lvl 65 enchanters should
sit in bazaar for hours buffing strangers for nothing, and are prepared to
voice their displeasure over ooc.
