No flames from me.  I have wanted to, on more than one occasion, let
loose the wrath of hell on more than one player, for things I
considered stupid.  I haven't, but that does not mean the desire was
not there.

Odds are pretty good that if you ever even run across the guy again,
he will have already either laughed it off as the rantings of some
n00b, or forgotten... water under the bridge.

In my not so subtle way, just wanted you to know there are valid
reasons for killing guards.  And just as valid reasons to learn
tactics to survive without them.  That is all.

Luck to you, and don't sweat it.
