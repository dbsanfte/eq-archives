 I doubt this change affects most low level mobs. If I had to guess I'd
say it was quest mobs along with some of the more uber encounters that
can be modified by handing an item to the NPC. Such as the infamous
Mecha-Cazic incident on Veeshan where someone from FoH gave a dispelling
sword and a haste sword to Cazic-Thule making him tougher than intended.
