Since this seems to be the exception to everyone else's observations,
and even to your own general observations, perhaps there was
something else going on.  Options that come to mine; he was Proccing
rather than casting (procs are instant and don't require you to stop
moving) or he was a bard (bards don't have to stop moving or swinging
or anything to start new songs, although there is a delay involved so
you can interrupt them)

A third possiblity, he was casting very short cast time spells, and what
with lag and you running for your life you didnt notice the little pauses.
I can stop spin cast Flash of Light and run off  faster than mobs can
swing a weapon.  At the same time there are some mobs where I can't
slip some of my stuns in between the "X is starting to cast a spell"
message and the point where it goes off.  (wizard mobs I think, wizards
must have very short cast times?)

And then there's the possibility that that one mob was somehow bugged
to not need to stop, and exploiting it on you.  /report mob cheating /petition
that bonecaster I just reported (see mob cheating) wasn't stopping to cast
his spells!
