Meeeeeeeee.  I don't have many male EQ characters these days, but I do have
a few, including my original Warrior (okay, so he was a Troll).  My freeform
gaming characters are probably 50/50, or heavier on the male side.

In EQ, it's just whatever model catches my mind's eye.  I don't do much RP
in EQ, but the characters do tend to have their own personalities.

In FFRP, I view it the same as writing.  I write about men and no one thinks
that's strange, so why not game those same characters?  I'm not pretending
to *be* the characters, I'm just transcribing the characters' reactions.  (I
could do an essay on that one. :D)
