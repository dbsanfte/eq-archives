I am rather curious about this -- oes the whole entire window turn the /con
color. If so, how does that affect people with custom UIs whose color scheme
may be something other that the default grey.

For example, my druid UI has a greeny, grass-ish background instead of the
default stone grey-- would this make red /cons brown?
