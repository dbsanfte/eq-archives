Thus far, no, its still here.

There's a great deal of conversation about

A) creating an EQ2 group and moving -them- there
B) Moving the EQ1 people somewhere, say to Rec.games.everquest
C) everyone just staying here for the time being

My vote is for C... and I suspect even if A is tried, a good many of the 
EQ2 players will keep posting here instead of moving

There's very little conversation here at the moment that relates 
directly to EQ1; the majority of posts are about comparisons of EQ1 and 
EQ2, or about the newgroup itself, or about poisoning someone in 
retaliation to theft (its Off Topic, but its being discussed).

Of the posts with actual game related content, most are about EQ2, which 
makes sense because its a new game and there are lots and lots of 
questions to be asked, many of them ones that have never been asked 
before.

Without a new expansion or a sizable patch, most EQ1 questions are old 
hat and can be answered by looking at the FAQ or googling up old posts 
from the 5 years this NG has been running.  If you can think of 
something you're curious about, though, start a thread; there are lots 
of EQ1 players still reading here, and lots more ex EQ1 players who are 
either A) trying EQ2, B) trying some other MMOG from WOW to COH to SWG 
or C) quit MMOG but haven't quit the NG (I'm in the latter category). 
Thats a large knowledge base to tap with your questions.

There's some comment as to whether EQ2 posts should have EQ2 in the 
subject (most seem to agree), EQ1 posts should have EQ1 in the subject 
(fewer people seem to suport this), or perhaps both (why not) or niether 
(that gets irritating quickly).  I'd go ahead and put EQ1 in without 
waiting for consensus, because what could it hurt?
