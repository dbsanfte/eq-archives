It sure is.  From what I have seen, it doesn't exist in EQ.  This isn't the 
"art of haggling":

a_typical_ECIdiot: WTS blade of foo | ring of bar | your sister's virginity 
| etc..
a_player_who_just_wants_a_price: How much are you selling the blade of foo 
for?
a_typical_ECIdiot: offer

If he were practicing the "art", he wouldn't just spew "offer".  This 
person is hoping you don't know the worth of the item and can, as they say 
in the car business, rip your head off.  If someone actually responded with 
a basic "What would you like to offer for this beautiful ring of foo?  It 
is priceless to me, but my failing mother back in Kelethin needs blah blah 
blah" then maybe there would some art to haggling in EQ.

He knows what they are doing, just as the rest of us who feel his way do.  
If -that- is considered insulting, then it's an insult not to answer my 
question: "How much is the [item]?"  It's an easy question.  I will 
rarely ask someone what they want for something when they don't put a price 
in their auction, but, when I do, the second they respond with "offer", I'm 
done.

I totally disagree that "haggling" in EQ is not an attempt to cheat you.  
In fact, where -isn't- it an attempt to cheat you?  The seller wants to get 
more then the goods' worth to him, or he wouldn't haggle.

I don't like haggling because I'm not interested in the time it takes to 
get to what is a "fair price".  I don't like "haggling" with 15-year olds 
who don't understand the process.

I know people who live to haggle and deal.  They thrive off the feeling 
that they "won", which is a result of them selling for more than they think 
something is worth ( ie. they ripped someone off in their mind ) or buying 
for less than they think something is worth ( ie. they ripped someone off 
in their mind ).  I have no interest in dealing with these people.  I don't 
in RL and I won't in EQ.

I wish the average consumer could be in on smoke breaks at car dealerships 
after a sale and hear what the general manager and finance manager say to 
each other about the sale.  It would make them sick.

I feel the exact way he does, and there's no discomfort involved.  I'm sure 
some people feel discomfort because of their personality, but I rather 
doubt that Mr. Shaw is one of them.

Whether someone gets a good deal is all perception, and you can argue that 
if both parties came out with the perception that they got a good deal, it 
was a win-win situation.  That's great if you are interested in investing 
the time to get one of those rare moments in EQ.  I don't have that 
interest.

If I were a porting class, and making money from porting, and someone 
shouts "Looking for a port to GFay, will donate." I would ignore it.  I'm 
not interested in hearing about how they only have 2pp on them because 
their corpse decayed the other day and all their cash was on it, blah blah 
bullshit.  It's always bullshit.  I love hearing the bullshit stories 
around the druid rings, they never cease to entertain me.

I helped code this exact thing on a MUD many years ago.  It's a great idea 
if it is done correctly.  Hopefully the Bazaar will make sense when they 
finish it.

Some people like to haggle.  Other don't.  There's nothing wrong with 
haggling if you like to do it, and there's nothing wrong with not wanting 
to haggle.  Everyone has opinions, right? =)

My friend Ted  : You know what they say about opinions?
Innocent person: Yeah...
My friend Ted  : You're an asshole.
