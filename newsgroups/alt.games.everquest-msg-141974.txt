Jeez.. I went there today to look at the price of plat.  I didn't know how
much it went for.  I was thinking to myself earlier.  If I can shell out 30
bucks for 40kpp, I think that would be a good investment.  I have played the
game since a month after beta, and I have a couple high level characters,
but I'm not good at making money.  In the three years I've been playing, all
together I've probably had 30kpp come through me, including items (half of
which I just spent on a Jaundiced Bone Bracer for my shaman.. best plat I
ever spent, cast it every other spell, hehe).  Anyways, the prices are
insane, so in a way i'm kind of glad plat costs so much in real money, so I
didn't have to wrestle with the decision of 'would it be right'.. but still,
would have been nice.  /grin.
