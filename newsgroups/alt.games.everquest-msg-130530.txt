Don't know where you end up in Freeport ... never finished that trip.  In
OOT you're in good shape.  In Tim Deep, you're at the Elven Outpost where
the shuttles are.  In FV, you're on the dock right by where the Maiden's
Voyage pulls (pulled) in.  In Butcher, you're at the docks.

Found the Translocator in Qeynos.  At the docks.  Sends you to Erud's
Crossing at Kerra Isle.  The landing point in Erudin is also by the dock.
