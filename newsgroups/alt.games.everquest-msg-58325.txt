Human night-blindness isn't half as bad as it used to be.

They've poked a few holes in that sack over our heads :-)

The major advantage of humans, besides faction, would be physical stats that
will help you very early in your career...that, and higher charisma than
most other mage races.....the cost of malachite seemed to keep my lowbie
mage continually broke.

Beyond the newbie stage, the Human advantage seems to disappear (unless
you're an incurable lootaholic, then the extra strength always comes in
handy :-) ).

For the long-haul, I'd choose another race, unless you want to be a human
for role-playing reasons.
