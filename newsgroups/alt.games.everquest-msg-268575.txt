Where was this?  I did some spot checking of a dozen major cities via
various stores that have availability information available online, and
it seems to have been widely available.

It was hard to find at my local BestBuy, because all 119 copies they had
in stock were in a stand-alone display nowhere near the gaming section.

They should be concerned...as a lot of people are pissed at the roughness of
the launch.  Lots of server unstability, and they've got the server limits
set low to force people to spread out, making it often hard to get on the
same server with friends.

How do you know this?  People who actually have *played* EQ2 have been able
to do reasonably well solo, and the developers say that they will be
accomodated.  It's true that grouping is encouraged, but soloing appears
to also work, at least for the casual player.

If you've got problems with kids, stay away from WoW.  You should have seen
the general chat channel on one of the PST RP servers last night, when a
bunch of kids showed up from other servers, looking for a place to pass the
time while their servers were down.
