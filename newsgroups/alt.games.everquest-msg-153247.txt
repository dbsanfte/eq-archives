Oh yeah! the Misty guards I hate those guys!  So the deal is they are
supposed to be there to help you, but if you kill close to them you always
get KS'd so then you have to go further out where it's more dangerous to
fight.  I levelled my first ever character there from 4-7th level.  I got
killed so many times there I think it's still my record.  Eight times in one
night.
