Quote from article... "Charisma has nothing to do with resist rates on Fear
spells..."

Meaning YOUR Charisma has nothing to do with HIS resisting a Fear spell...

Effects listed for Ro's Fiery Sundering
http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spelldescriptions.asp?Id=1512&Page=2
"At level 55, this debuffs following: AC: -5 CHA: -6 FR: -39" (Cinamon
tost - ayonae ro)

Meaning YOUR Charisma (maybe) affects your own resist rates


Now I can't prove any of this... but I suspect the answer given at Fan Faire
was carefully worded to ONLY answer the question about Necro Fear. I've got
a sneaky feeling the Charisma might be a secondary check on some resist
rates (that -CHA has to be there for a reason).

Anyone got more than annecdotal evidence to support or refute this? (eg
parsed data?)
It might be time for ALL of us (not just charm/fear casters) to have another
look at Charisma gear.
