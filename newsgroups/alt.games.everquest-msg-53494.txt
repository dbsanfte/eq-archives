Which was admittedly over the line, but right in line with what he asked
for.  Oddly enough, I've made the same challenge to morons previous. 
And I know that my info is in fact available in under 5 minutes with
google. Further, I don't have a particularly common name so tracing me
would be trivial.  The difference, is I know exactly what of my info is
and isn't publicly available; and I know what kind of psycho's are out
there and I have contingency plans in case one shows up at my door
again.  I've been stalked online and IRL.  I know the risks I'm taking
being online and I take what I feel are necessary precautions.  I
don't/won't stalk someone online, but if someone makes an ass out of
themself and his info is easily available(under 10 minutes searching)
I'll warn them(Just like I warned morley) and if further challenged,
post it. I don't know lokari's IRL name or posting info, BUT if I wanted
it, she does have a distinctive posting style and I venture to guess I
could come up with it in under an hour.  I'm not going to, because I've
never seen her tell someone who was right that they were stupid and
wrong, and proceed to thrash for 2 days.  It's likely, given the size of
the tech world that we will cross paths one day.
