I researched it myself, so can't speak from firsthand knowledge, but an
SK in our guild mentioned Neriak when I asked. You could try that.

Not *all* mobs, but most. The frustrating part is that the mobs who drop
the words for spell level "x" are rarely an easy kill for a single
player at level "x".  That said, I seem to recall I got a lot of the
words for that level off of the gargoyles in OoT. But I didn't solo them
until level 18. But in general, just hunt around. Lots of mobs drop low
level research components of various types. And remember to *always*
check the vendors int the zones where they spawn, and the nearest bank
zones. At low levels, people are still often keeping them and selling
them to vendors. You can find a shocking number of the ones you need on
vendors.

No, IMO. Waste of time, money and patience. And last I checked, most of
those quests were still broken, except the lowest level ones. (Though of
course, those might help you.)
