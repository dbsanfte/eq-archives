After a Black Ornate Chain horse eh? <grin>

Do it. 

Bazaar is a godsend. 

You can find tradeskill components by the bucketload there. I did my
smithing pre-patch, but probably still did more than you'll need to do
(221 + 15% hammer) Buy Leather paddings as much as possible, and buy
skins/pelts and spiderlings to make your own paddings.

Fine plate was the way I went, though the cultural or Cabbage earring
might work too. You have to do a little sub-smithing if you go the plate
route IIRC, but only one level.

Don't think there's anything but anecdotal evidence that the type of
item you're creating effects skillup rate in any way.

He'll probably be empty again within an hour of a patch too, as lots of
people have ore mules to buy him out soon as he gets new ore - I know I
do.

Sad to say, but you missed the boat. 

Pre-patch, you could do banded to 175 with vendorbought stuff. In nonKOS
in freeport you could do it without moving more that 2 feet.

Few extra tips:

Don't neglect tradeskill mod items though. Easy 5% mod from a tinkered
geerlock for a few 100pp. Tougher 10% mod from a belt in Sanctus Seru
(Preats). Even tought 15% hammer from Creator in Ssra.

If money is REALLY no object, make the highest trivial items you can
with the least combines. You'll save a few minutes selling/destroying
successfully combined items if you keep failing

Die. Making a corpse is a great way to get extra inventory space for
your no-drop stuff. Ideally you want 8 x empty 10 slot bags to avoid
running around.

Tweak your UI. If you're comfortable messing around with the UI xml
files, make a custom tradeskill mod with larger combine buttons or
differently shaped bags for faster combining.
