First thing i need to do really is get my velious port spells in WL. Should
I try and run through kael, or maybe fix faction there first. Maybe I should
just buy a port to WL and forget about kael, but I hear that a certain
dragon makes that dangerous. Can i port in with camo up and be safe from
this dragon?
Where are some places I can solo here? I heard wyverns in cs are good, but
maybe they are greening out at 56? I will probably check out the legendary
VL soon, but I guess thats groups only.
