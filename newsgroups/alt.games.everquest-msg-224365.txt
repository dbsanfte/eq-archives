Once root has taken it is checked each tick against the mobs MR (at
the start of the tick I assume as immediate root breaks wouldn't
otherwise happen).  Easy to test this, compare a vanilla root against
one with a MR modifier and then compare with Malos(inia) on the mob
and without.  Spiders and statues in Velks are good mobs to test this
with as they have good innate MR.

Anything with a DD component will randomly break root (nukes, rains,
weapon procs, innate pet procs, buffed pet procs, DoTs with an initial
DD component etc etc).  Pure DoTs won't break root, projectile damage
won't break root.

However, I'm inclined to believe stuns (whether spell, kick, bash or
proc) can break root as can the rooted mob hitting a damage shielded
target as anecdotally any time I root park a mob and ANYONE whether
pet or player is hitting it the chances of my root running for full
duration *seems* massively reduced.  I try and back my pet off root
parked targets ASAP for this reason.
