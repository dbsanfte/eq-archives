You have to use longer lasting songs like Katta. 4 is very doable for me, 
but usually the first one dies out just about 1/2 a sec before I get it 
started again, so it makes it worthwhile in most cases. 

With the right songs, it's actually possible to have 6 up, but it's not 
worth it and you can't keep them up consistently. The only way to guarantee 
you maintain all songs running is to only twist 3 because of the way the 
server ticks work.
