Yes, I know people can set up web-based email boxes easily
and cheaply enough (hotmail.com, etc.), but maybe this
dweeb doesn't know that.

Have you actually tried setting up for online (or phone) credit
card payments to you?  My wife and I looked into it a while
back when we were considering creating a web-based business,
and after a few weeks of research the answer was, "not worth
the expense and hassle".

Now imagine a young EQ addict jumping through those hoops...

Given the webpage building software that's out there now, much
of it available for free download, my *dog* could make a better
web page.

Wow, what a remarkably childish accusation.

Gosh, Sparky, I guess that's why I posted earlier messages
documenting why the "not against the EULA" claim is a lie,
why I reminded people that there's nothing you can do to
prevent these guys from stealing all your stuff if you use
their service, and why I called the idea "lame" in the post
to which you are responding.

So that I can know how to address you more appropriately in
the future, please let me know whether you made this accusation
because you are a) a moron, b) an asshole, or c) all of the above.

Sure.  If I wasn't clear enough previously, let me state that
I think anyone would be an idiot (not to mention a real loser) to
partake of this "service".


>Scams work best when people are stupid enough to believe in the sincerity of

Of course they do.

But I still think that the person behind this "business opportunity"
is a sincere but not-too-bright kid trying to make a few bucks on the
side doing what he enjoys doing.

A real scammer would price the "service" such that people might
actually be tempted.  Only a starry-eyed kid would go, "woo hoo,
look at all the money I could make, let's not underprice this
wonderful idea."

Further evidence that makes me tend to believe that this is a
"real" (albeit ridiculous) offer is the "we'll do skills for
you, but we price them higher because they're no fun" clause,
the disjointed and not-too-lucid explanations, the puerile earnestness,
the "we don't want to work too hard" openness (e.g. "During raids
We will not be the main puller, too much stress"), and so on.

I wouldn't touch it with a twenty foot battle lance, and I
don't think anyone else should either, but I still say it
reads more like a kid's eager get-rich-quick scheme than anything
else.
