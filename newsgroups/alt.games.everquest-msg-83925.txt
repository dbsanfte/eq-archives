Only if it never bothered you.

Before I turned off my messages I'd simply take a few steps away (just far
enough to break the inspect) when I got the message...and keep doing it
(usually 3 or 4 times) before they got as annoyed with me as I was (at the
start) with them.  After those 3 or 4 attempts that's when it started to get
amusing more than anything else.
