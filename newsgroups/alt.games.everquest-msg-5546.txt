Wrong.  Coming from someone who plays a 56 magician and 55 necromancer,
_wrong_.

My best pet _at 56_ and _fully buffed_ would be able to beat a level 50
warrior, but not stand much of a chance at all against a level 55 warrior
(one that dresses appropriately and not in cloth with a rusty dagger).  A
heavily twinked level 50 warrior can eat my current best pet and be ready
for seconds.

_No_ pets do damage and have hit points on the same scale as NPC warriors,
this is just patently wrong (and even wrong _against_ your point since at
some stages magician pets have _more_ hp than comparable level NPCs).

Also, magician pets don't vary much at all in the amount of hp they have
between the different types, but they do vary in how much damage they take
when getting hit.

Since pets top out at about 45 yes, they will have more hp than an equivalent
level PC, but since my pet tops out at about 45 even when I'm level 60,
that's a terrible comparison to make.  Believe me, even a halfling warrior
at 60 will have more _unbuffed_ hp than the best magician or necro pet.

And FG is, I believe, always level 45.  I still get exp for it at 56, which
I wouldn't if it was level 40 (or even 41 or 42 or 43).

Hope I cleared up some of your misconceptions.
