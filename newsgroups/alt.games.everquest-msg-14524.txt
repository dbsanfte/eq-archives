No, your watch does not know the time. Any more than your floor knows it has
carpet. But, a company is an entity comprised of its parts, the same way you
are. If the french fry division of McDonalds knew it was using lard to season
the fries, then the company knew it.

They make decision. Reason, just like with people, is beyond the grasp of most
of them.

================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."

                   From "Travels with Charlie"
