Player made jewelry uses the Jewelry skill. Of all the trade skills, it is
by far the most expensive to master. In order to make *magic* jewelry (such
as your earrings), you would also need the services of an enchanter to
enchant your metals. With the cost of failures as you level in the skill and
the going rate for a stack of magicked metals, only a wealthy enchanter can
make the skill worth while. You are much better off simply buying individual
pieces.
