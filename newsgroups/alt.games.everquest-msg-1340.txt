Nope. I tried it. Didn't work. "You try to hit a wisp, but it's INVULVERABLE!"
Went out and got some splitpaw gloves. Fairly cheap, magical, and bangs the
wisps up pretty good.
  Hope you're not soloing.  I remember 7th level, and those wisps would have
still kicked my butt into a CR even with splitpaws.
