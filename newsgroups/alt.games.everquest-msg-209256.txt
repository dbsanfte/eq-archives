It costs downtime.  And a lot of it.  By the time you summon a pet,
summon all the stuff you plan to equip it with, give the equipment
to the pet, and buff your pet, you've chewed up most of your mana.
Now you get to sit and wait 5 minutes while you med up.  Your 5
minutes may not be valuable to you, but my 5 minutes is valuable to
me.

Before PoK trivialized travel, traveling through multiple dangerous
zones involved doing this dance for each zone.  (Unless, of course,
you trusted your invis spell not to drop at a bad time -- assuming
all the zones you're traveling through didn't have mobs that couldn't
see through invis.)  Remember, mages have no crowd control -- it's
not like you can root & run and keep going.  A mage without a pet
is dead meat.

When I played a mage regularly, some days really tried my patience.
Zone into Mistmoore, do the dance, get trained.  Zone out.  Zone
back in.  Repeat the dance.  Get trained.  Zone out.  Zone back in.

Wash.  Rinse.  Repeat.

In a nutshell, I disagree with your claim that "it costs virtually
nothing to summon a pet".  Sure, clicking the spell gem by itself
is trivial, but getting truly ready takes a non-trivial amount of
time.
