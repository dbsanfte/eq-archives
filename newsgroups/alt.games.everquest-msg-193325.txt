Don't worry Kaevy, I won't be back for your entertainment in the near
future. I'm not really that interested in this newsgroup.   You
certainly have nothing to offer than I'm interested in.  I've read the
original post & my respond to that post at least 6 times,  I still
can't figure out how you came to the conclusion that I somehow stated
or implied that I was poor.  In fact, the opposite is true.   You'd be
surprised at what I have in the bank & how I earned it (certainly not
from looting or casting my KEI).  I give my KEI away for free
(always).  The reason most enchanters are rich is because that type of
character requires a certain level of intelligence which you don't
have.  

Don't bother replying to this post with another one of your nasty
little notes because I'm won't be back to read it.  You'll be wasting
everyones time & bandwiidth.  But, someone like you always has to have
last the word.   No doubt.  It's part of being the troll that you are.

May all your travels be pleasant.  

Tom
