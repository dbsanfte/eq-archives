Go to Highpass Hold (or whatever it's called) right now. You are high
enough. Get into the Orc Group and you will get to 19 very quickly.
Enchanters are exttemely helpful at the Orc Group. I met some very
knowledgable and friendly players there on Tunare Server.

When you hit 19, hightail it to Paludal Caverns and get in a bandit
group. The bandits are social so you will be wanted there, also. The
most incredible xp I've ever seen. I went from barely 19 to 20 in a
little over an hour.

Have fun.
