Pretty lucky new player you envisage who has two level 80 friends and 
prepared to spend 3 long days PL'ing them.
Face it, for the majority of new players, they wont know anyone and wont see 
anyone (pretty much) in the zones they go to.

Heck back in 2004 when I levelled up my last alt, all the zones were empty. 
Even when I got up to my 40's and 50's, once (extremely) popular zones like 
karnors castle and velks lab were totally empty.
Places like aviak city in SK used to be so busy you had to fight for pulls. 
That was totally deserted too.

I can just imagine its got worse since then.

I dont think that theres anything unfun about the game at 20, just that the 
zones are deserted. Im not sure why EQ is such a top heavy game. WOW hasn't 
been going as long of course, but for almost 4 years into existence its 
playerbase seems a lot more spread out than EQ was at 4 years in. Most of 
the early zones are still packed with players.
