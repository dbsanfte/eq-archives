There is a bastardized way to do it that I did once and was actually quite
successful with.  We had a Rogue pick the lock then a 56ish necro lured him
out.  We took him down with 1 group and NO tanks classes (Rogue hid and did
not engage Reaver, nor was he in our group).

What we did was I used mage 51 earth pet, the necro used his monk pet and
each had my highest mage damage shield.  (25hp's-per-tick but no resists
that I saw.)  The necro and I just continued to burn our full mana meter on
chain-casting pets (and me keeping each with my damage shields).  The other
people we had in-group were a chanter, a druid and a shaman.  I can't
remember if the shaman used his pet or not but it was those critters that
took the Reaver down.
We each knew that we would run after the necro looted/FD'ed and let my mage
pet cover our escape from the respawn.  (It was some Iksar ghost, don't
recall the name, though).  It went over really well.  Necro didn't even have
to FD and just looted letting my pet keep full taunt while we all gated (no
tank classes having to run!  =)  ).

So it _can_ be done, but use heavy pet classes (necro had to switch off monk
pet after first cast to be successful), chain-cast them, don't draw the
aggro and run after each Reaver.  It's a slower way but a whole lot easier
to coordinate than a huge raid.
