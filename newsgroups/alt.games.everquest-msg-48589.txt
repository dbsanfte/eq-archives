Er I'd frankly do something about this though if you can. This person
is actually exhibiting stalker like behavior. I'd at least report this
to the FBI or someone and try to at least get the identity of this
person known for when they might come knocking on your door.

getting info on you and actually bothering to post it here (why?) I'd
take this VERY seriously.
