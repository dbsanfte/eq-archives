<snip a lot of name calling, hatred and anger>

Wow, Falsa. You sound like you have a lot of anger to deal with. If you're
really trying to be useful (and I believe you are), wouldn't it be better to
control your name calling and anger and let your position rest on its own
persuasive power, and not let it be tainted by the attention being paid to
the messenger's demeanor? I started reading this thread, was mildly annoyed
in the way that I am when the Jehovah's Witnesses come to my door and start
preaching to me that I'm going to hell, but I politely listen to them before
I thank them and close the door, so I read on. But it's starting to feel now
like the Jehovah's Witnesses are calling me "stupid", "a fool", "a
doomsayer", and irresponsible for "putting my head into the sand" because I
don't believe in their god, especially if I have children, and so on. At
this point, I've lost all interest in who their god is or why they care
about me and all I can think about is why they would spend so much time and
energy calling me names and telling me I'm an idiot.

Fortunately, most Jehovah's Witnesses know better than this and are very
polite and allow their message to spread on the force of its own compelling
power, without resorting to name calling and insults (yes, I know, you
didn't start it, but consider your own words about escalation cycles).  In
short, they've learned how to be more effective. I realize you're not
shopping for advice here, so I don't expect a happy response from you ;-)
but I couldn't remain on the sidelines anymore on this one, given the
gravity of the subject matter. Do it justice.
