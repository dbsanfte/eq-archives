I have learned more about my role.

I typically go into a group with all of my buffs on, with just medded up
mana to 100.

I buff the tanks with the Symbol, AC, and Strenght buffs, and their pets if
they
have them, and make sure I know their levels and approx hit points.  My heal
still
does 93.....I thought clerics got a 15% modifier increase, but at level 19,
I don't
see that....I just see the increase from 88 to 93 that accounts for my
levels above
14.

I sit and med off to the side of B1 in PC.  I tried twice to get to B2 and
died each time.
The last time I was invited to B2, I said, send a tank to get me and I'm
yours.  They
declined and I waited for a spot in the B1 group, earning my spot by healing
when
the dung hit the fan for folks...heal only no buffs and I waited till most
were down
to 25% before doing it....never healed the casters, just tanks and the
backup tanks...

Not been faced with possible TPW, but if I was I would try and get a root on
the
main attacker and then get the H3ll out of dodge with who ever was left...

later,

Aoebe
