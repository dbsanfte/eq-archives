The point people are trying to explain to you, though, is that it's great
you're in a guild with a surplus of clerics to be able to be so lax about
healing.  Not everybody plays with constant overwhelming force, though.  :)
Just out of curiosity, what do you consider "normal" numbers?

As reference, we wiped to MM (first try though, always excuseable) on
Wednesday night.  We had 38 and saw that he was very doable now that we know
how the whole encounter works.  We had just finished with RD, and only left a
few behind due to not having the right flags, so maybe 45 as the total raid
force for the night.  That's pretty much our average for any big target.  We
break 50 semi-regularly, but if you actually look around you realize that
half a dozen are 2-boxed and sitting in a corner waiting for a flag, so not
really "there".  :)

Last two Vindi's I've done were a 20-second thrashing by an AoW force and a
tooth-and-nail fight to the finish with 8 people.  He looks so different
from those two perspectives.  :)  I think you've forgotten what it's like
from the challenging side.  :P
