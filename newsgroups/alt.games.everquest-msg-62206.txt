I've got an erudite necro, and while most of their downsides can be
minimized, the one that annoyed me most (and made me abandon him in favor of
my current druid) was the difficulty in finding anywhere to hunt level 5-8
or so

ground out 5 in the newbie yard
wandered around toxx for  -A WEEK- to make 6
tried to hunt the entry in the warrens but there's no real way to only pull
one kobold there and you can't take on 2,
finally snuck my way over to QeyHills til 8
went back to Paineel for my level 8 spells, got a port to WC and never gone
back  (he's currently level 12 sitting in OOT killing sirens since level 10)

the other downside of the race is the nightblindness, but humans have it
too, and at level 8 you get deadeye which mostly fixes the issue, except for
the annoyance of having to refresh it every 30 min or so
someday I'm gonna get him a harvester... (permanent deadeye in offhand slot,
with some ac int etc)

faction-wise, you're loved in Paineel where you start, dubious on the main
path in erudin from toxx to the boat (didn't go into the palace), KoS
aboveground in Qeynos, amiable in the sewers, KoS in Halas (duhhh...),
apprehensive everywhere in Neriak, except the ghouls outside necro guild,
just IvU past them, dubious or better to everyone in Freeport except that
damned fucking gnome near the bank and the barbarian at the docks, KoS to
dorfie guards in BB, KoS to wood elf guards, dubious (!) to the newbie
guards at Felwithe, didn't check gnomies, KoS to trolls in Innothule (and
froggies), didn't check ogres, didn't check Halflings.  Also, definitely
Amiable in OT outpost, and most likely KoS to FV (and Cabilis), and default
factions in Velious (KoS to orcs, giants, dragons, apprehensive to dorfies,
indiff to tizmak)

played a DE necro once, Nektulos was bad, damned guards kept KSing my fire
beetles (deleted DE necro at level 2)

On humans, start in Freeport, Qeynos you have to hide in the sewers mostly,
AFAIK, Freeport you should be ok, except that god damned fucking gnome near
the bank and probably the barbarian at the dock.

Never played a gnome (any class).

Iksar have some advantage as a necro due to their innate regen, when
combined with Lich line of spells for more mana.
But, their faction is even worse than any other race (except in Cabilis
where everybody loves them).

I think thats all races that can be necros, too lazy to check (though for
some reason my addled head keeps telling me Half-elf necros are cool)
