Nah. That sounds like they smelled newbie and wanted to exploit your lack 
of experience. You'd probably be more successful reporting *them* for 
harrassment, but that will require that you become a bit more familiar with 
the reporting and petitioning mechanisms, so don't sweat it, just dedicate 
yourself to exploring and having fun. If somebody wants your sword, just 
target them and do:

/laugh

and when you get tired of poking fun at them

/ignore
