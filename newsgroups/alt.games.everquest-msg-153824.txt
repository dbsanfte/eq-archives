After all is said and done the best well rounded characters, not
speaking of players here, are the ones that solo. All skills get maxed
because you will and must use them all. A Paladin who has soloed
extensively will have all defense and casting skills maxed, a grouped
one will not for example. Grouped players tend to be the laziest out
there, mind you the word tend. Solo as long as you like you can always
group later, the ones who always grouped will not be able to solo,
they will not have the skills for it.
