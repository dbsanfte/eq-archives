 I don't think they made it with EQ vets in mind. I just finished up
three months of SWG and I am happily quitting for EQ2. Seems to me the
game is great if you either like trade skills and PvP. The PvE "game
story" is stuck in it's perpetual original post Hoth battle
setting.It's been the most stable civil war I have ever seen. IMP NPC
and Rebel NPC all in their same spots they were when it was live. At
least EQ did do some events that altered the game world; two years
after the release of SWG and all you have to look forward to is a
combat revamp. MoBs don't wander, they hover around their "nest".
Quest can been done for loads of money (these are defiantly not the
few silver, faction, and elfin trail mix kind of quests).

Funniest part was when they released the Jedi qualification quests
(making your character a jedi)which made becoming a jedi in a time
when their were only two and a half jedi easier than the EQ epic
weapon quest (which took me three years)and throw in Jump to Light
Speed beta and they killed the one aspect of the game that still had a
strong following; the PvP. People ran off to do Jedi grinds and play
beta; the PvP game crumbled away.

SWG is a cluster f**k. Now my friends who love it for PvP (all UO
fans)and sadden by the collapse of PvP are telling me like Linus
waiting for the Great Pumpkin, "Combat revamp will make the game fun
again and everybody who left will want to return." 


Yeah right....
