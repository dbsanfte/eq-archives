Yes, hit the MGB hotkey, then cast the group spell.

The first group spell that leaves a buff icon will be affected, if you are
interrupted while casting, MGB will reset, and you'll need to hit it again.

It's a group spell, it doesn't matter who you target.

MGB can also be activated by using a / command, /alt act <some number here>,
IIRC, google it for more info.
