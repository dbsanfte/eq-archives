If you're close enough that the mob does not need to move to hit you, then
yes, they will give you the priority, simply because you're a caster
class and you rank high on their hit list once agro'd anyway.

If however, you are outside of the mobs melee range, they almost always
follow general taunt rules. (ie, it hates most that which has pissed it
off the most - which should be the pet)

.. and possibly the mage pet had rooted it at least once during the fight
already. Major taunt factor there - whether the spell hit or not.

Aye. STR buffs have a noticeable impact on maximum damage output.
