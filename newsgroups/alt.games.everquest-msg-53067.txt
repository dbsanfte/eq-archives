Heh...  A few nights ago, our guild staged an "expedition" into the
warrens...  Not something where we would simply kill everything in sight,
but to where we could get the lowbies in our guild some XP, as well as have
a group event, get to know one another, etc...

I, a newly leveled 29th Druid, had porting duties, so that we could get
everyone there...  No problem...  Ours is a small guild, and I am, thus far,
the only one capable of teleporting others.  So I accepted my task
happily...

At any rate, during the expedition, two of our newly initiated members of
our guild started acting like asses... Starting trains, and generally
badmouthing the guild...  It got so bad, the guildmaster had to boot them
from the guild completely.

Now, here's the point of the story.  I was going to be kind enough to
teleport the former guild-mates to a location of their choosing.  One was
demanding that I do it now (I fully intended to, just to be rid of them),
and the other one started badmouthing the guildmaster, calling him certain
offensive terms...  I told him to enjoy the walk all the way back home to
the Commons, and disbanded him from the group.  I was about to click on the
Circle spell to port the last guy out, when he started blasting me in group
chat, demanding that I port the other person back, and telling me how much I
suck...  Okie... /disband...  Now the tells start... ooh, lookie here...
/ignore...

Now, I am not a vindictive or mean person... After all, I -was- going to
port them back out, so they wouldn't be stranded...  But hey, tick off
someone doing you a favor - they're not inclined to do said favor for you...
=)
