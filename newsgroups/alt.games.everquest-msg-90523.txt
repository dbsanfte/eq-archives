Shrug. Sometimes I deliberately stay and die so a caster makes it out.
Other times I'm just pissed off and not going to run. Other times I
know even if I run I'm not gonna make it so might as well hold out and
see what happens. 

And sometimes.... not often, maybe 1 in 10 times, I misjudge my health
and die right on the zoneline. I am reknowned for zoning with 70 hp left
from 3900 hp or so and having all my buffs stripped cause the game couldnt
decide if I made it or not it was so close.

Why?

Well, a lot of the time, I saunter back in after a few heals/a little
fungi time and they say "wooo sui you made it! And we killed the <critter>!"


Its nice to think you helped keep the group in your camp spot intact.
