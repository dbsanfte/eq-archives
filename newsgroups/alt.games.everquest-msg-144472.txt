Druids are part of the essentail patch healers during CHC on MA, also patch
healers are placed with the casters to heal them so the clerics can focus on
the tankage.

Pick a class you like to play.

All classes offer somehing to the high end raid game.

Rogues are essential for damage melee, Rangers also.
Monks for pulling the raid.
Clerics essentail for healing
Wizards esential for damage, without rogues and wizards the fights last too
long.
Necros and Mages for Mana regen.
Warriros to tank the mob you raiding.
Paladins and SKs now play valuable roles.
Shaman to slow that mob and buff the melee.
Chanters for their buffs and debuffs.

Ony class i klnow nothing on is a BST, ha no experience with them in the
high end game to know their worth.
