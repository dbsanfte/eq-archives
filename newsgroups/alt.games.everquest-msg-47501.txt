Well, being KOS to something or another is just part of the game.. though
I'm sure you are wondering whether or not you are in "trouble" with anyone
that you -should- be "friends" with.  In that case, no.

I often hunted them on PvP and non-PvP servers alike for the Skull of
Jhen'Tre.  Treasured PvP item before you get the better items of course.

Though, a word of precaution.  Even if these things are green to you (some
of them may, I dunno what your level is), you must be sure to NOT fight them
in or around the water, or atleast I wouldn't suggest it. As it is
humiliating and well, a PITA if you die due to drowning, AFTER one of these
things root you.  Not a very pretty sight at all.
