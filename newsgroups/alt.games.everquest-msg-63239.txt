I am going to be out of town visiting for several weeks, and was
wondering if there was any way for me to use my account on my fathers
computer? The last thing I want is for my account to be
suspended\deleted in any way and would appreciate some advice. Also,
what happens if I get a new comp or something and would like to play
EQ on it? Anyway, I suspect the answer will address both of my
questions. Thanks
