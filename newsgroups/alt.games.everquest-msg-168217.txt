Bad luck on the RNG, I'd say. We had some dry streaks as well, but we
kept wiping out the camps of kobolds up the valley from the druid ring
over and over again for several hours and finally got 21 for Tarr's
armor. They are not as rare as the clockwork motors, but far more so
than the crude bronze drops.

As to the motors, as I said in a different post, I've now gotten them
off a few different types/levels of clockworks, so just keep
slaughtering them. I'd say it's their rarest drop.
