castersrealm says 2 things about that.  1) no matter how low the faction you 
can always get writs from any faction, and 2) the amount of faction increase 
is much more than the amount of faction decrease with the other 4.  Meaning, 
if you did all 5 writs all the time, your faction for all of them would 
steadily increase.
