OK, I've found a good spot to farm exp through 49 but it's boring.

Where's a good place for a Necromancer to go that has either interesting
loot or is just plain fun? The catch: I'm rarely on for more than an hour at
a time so I need a spot I can either solo or do a pick up group. I'm not
looking for a long camp unless the placeholders are interesting to hunt.

A couple of ideas have occured to me ... anyone want to comment on the
feasibility or suggest alternatives:
+ Try and get the parts for the Astral Pants of the titan (paying a tracker
to find the titan/gorilla)
+ Try and get a Rallic pack (though I'll need a partner to trade the pouch
in)
