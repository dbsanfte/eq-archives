Thanks Foxeye.  She's not the only guilty one here, of course.  I could have
acted like a gentleman with her, but I didn't, and I'm glad I did get it off
my chest.

The listing of her character names was too much, sure it was, but I don't
think I accurately portrayed how badly she treated me.  It just felt good,
though I know it was wrong.
