A) "must have"
B) This is two sentences connected with a comma.
C) I do not recall any credit card education in preschool.

A) It would only be false advertisement if they said "No credit card 
necessary"
B) The box does say the game requires a valid credit card. That 
proclamation is in English though, so you may not have understood it.

That would be quite the tremendous feat for Sony!

I would have to be stupid to see it your way.

That would be "their". Most people I know that have been through the 12th 
grade would know that. 

Drastic? What is drastic about paying for a product?

Wow. That is one hell of a mangled excuse for a language.

I do not have no wifes. I have a wife, however. If I had multiple, I would 
say I had wives.

The irony is killing me here, trollboy.

It boggles my mind that your kind can function in a world with doorknobs, 
traffic lights, and instruction manuals.
