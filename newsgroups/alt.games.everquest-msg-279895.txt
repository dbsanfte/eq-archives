The pause can also be affected in the zone you're in.  I found while
fishing in CS I can have fishing pause almost half as those when I'm
in PoK.  I'd guess the crowd can slow the responses and you'd need to
adjust for longer delay in crowded zone.  Or just head to an out of
way zone and try there.  I mean when was the last time you saw more
than 2 toons in Scarlet Desert in the entire day?
