They can be done if the pet keeps aggro. If they start to hit you
directly then you've got problems! Grouping does make it easier but
it's no longer impossible to do solo.

Which is why I don't group much anymore. Can take for ever to find a
group and the exp isn't much better anymore. You can 3-4% for soloing
a low risk green heroic mob or 3-4% taking on a high risk red heroic
mob!

God yes I saw an old TV program made before EQ2 was released. They had
the guy making the sea look all pretty on. When asked if it mattered,
he replied yes since people will be fighting a lot in the sea. Brought
a smile to my face!

If you look at COH people are very keen to do other peoples quests.
That's because they get good exp and money for doing it. They don't
get any quest credit though. If EQ2 did the former it might help. Ie,
everyone gets the exp and coin bonus for finishing a quest and not just
the person who has the quest.
