Heh, yeah, LDoN has really resurrected the pickup group.  And for
all the bad things I've experienced in pickup groups my unreliable
play schedule leaves me little choice as I don't care to play solo
much at all anymore.  I am finding that it's getting better tho,
at least for mid-50s groups.  Some of the least capable players
aren't hanging around the LDoN camps anymore, and many of those
who were pretty ignorant a month ago have learned a thing or two
in the interim.  And sometimes I stumble into a group that is just
amazingly effective.  :)

Still, there are quite a few details that not many casual players
seem to know or understand.  Last night I was in a group that
refused to do an assassinate mission, because "my friend was on
one where the boss was unstunnable and CH'd and gated" (his
friend was L56).  I'd be willing to wager a tidy little sum that
the boss was not, in fact, unstunnable.   Rather, I am confident
that the boss was over L55 (the only boss I've killed was L56)
and thus immune to most stuns, which cap at L55.  As it happens,
Paladins get a very fast casting stun that works on targets up to
L61 from a trivial quest in PoTranquility, and bashing works
(sometimes) on every caster I've ever fought, including the L56
boss I helped kill.  But because the group leader (Enchanter)
was certain that unstunnable bosses had been patched in we waited
for another mission.

And then there are the Enchanters who feel naked without a Cleric,
or something.  Having a skilled Enchanter in the group means that
you can get by just fine with a Druid for a healer, even mid-50s
and relying on Sup. Heal.  This assumes that the Druid is clever
enough to realize that he needs to forget about being a utility
man and just concentrate on keeping people healthy, but it works.
