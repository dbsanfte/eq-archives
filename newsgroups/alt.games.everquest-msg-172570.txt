My computer does not have the modem.  One computer in the house on the
household has the modem.  I have that computer dial out.  Now, I have
tried reinstallation and full remove of Norton Internet Security.  The
only firewall app I am using is ZoneAlarm.

Even though I have just been able to login, I had to move the modem to
my computer.  I am currently thinking that the firewalls on the
computer that connects to the internet is blocking the login
information.
