Meant to add to the last post: I think <alt>P is for the Party window
(but I've changed my keys around so I can't be sure).  Try <alt>F1.
It's also possible that you've changed what the key is for bringing up
the pet window.  You can check which key it is for you by opening your
Options window, in the Keyboard tab, category UI.
