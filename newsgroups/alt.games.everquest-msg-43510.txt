I consider all of you morons sorry but he had a valid point about the Card
info. Mistakes can happen but it cost him even more money for something that
clearely was not his fault. He did not enter the info but it DID cost him
directly to fix the mistake that Verant made . They should credit his acct
for the lost charges on his phone bill. And if you think he was raging read
what the fuck you wrote. we dont come here to read flames so anyone who
flamed him is just as incompetent as the Person that cost him the extra
money to correct the mistake made at verant. How about they mess up on your
next billing cycle and you have to call to get it fixed? I would think that
would be fitting considering the ranting flames you posted =)
