Most likely it's an old pottery guide. I forget when, but sometime after
the Plains of Power expansion I believe, the Learn rate for pottery was
*drastically* reduced. It used to be, you'd train to Pottery(1), buy a
stack of stuff, make 20 combines, and get to Pottery(19). Your next stack
of combines would get you to Pottery(38) or so. Etc. This with an uber-twinked
wisdom of 110. You could trivially get to Pottery(130) in about 20-30pp,
in about 15-20 minutes, tops.  Now, you're lucky to get a single skill
raise per stack of combines, even at the low skill levels.
 
Oh well.          

Could also be you're using a *very* expensive progression. I used Small
Jars(31), Medium Jars(36), Large Jars(41), Small Bowls(102), Medium
Bowls(122). Don't bother firing anything, just drop successes on the ground.
Halas is an excellent city for training up the skill, with all the components
for these pottery combines, a bank, and a pottery wheel, all conveniently
in one reasonably lag-free zone.
