Unless you play on a Zek (red) server, you can't be
hurt by your groupmates, only yourself.

Any targeted detrimental spell can be cast on you,by you if
you accidentally have yourself targeted (yes, I have
nuked myself before - ouch).

Any class with rain spells (they are targeted aoe
spells) must be careful to be out of the aoe of the
spell as well (as they will soak up a hit).

PBAOE spells center around the caster and don't hurt
them though.
