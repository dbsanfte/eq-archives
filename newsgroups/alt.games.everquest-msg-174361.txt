There are a few counter examples, like the Restless Burrower, where the mob
won't pop for some days after patch (in this case, starts out as pupae and
slowly grows if untouched).  Of course the one I remember most vividly that was
like this was unspawned Ragefire, who would pop three to five days after
patch... and when I was finally ready for him, they'd recently done the SOL
expansion and were patching every two days at least for a month, preventing him
from Ever popping.

I have a reputation for being Always Right.  While this is incorrect (I have
been wrong on occaision) it does help that I rarely use absolutes, so a single
counterexample doesn't make me wrong.
