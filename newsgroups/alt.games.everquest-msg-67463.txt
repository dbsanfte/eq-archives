    Levelling to get new spells is part of the game, indeed the point of the
game. Is that like levelling to remove the book? Obviously, you think so.
But consider this: the spells you have at level X are appropriate for level
X. Your nuke is the right size, your CHA buff is the right size, your mezzes
are the right duration - the spells are tailored to what you are and what
you're doing at that level. "The Book" isn't related to any in-game
function - it's an artificial artifact of the original design, when enough
players complained about being blind if they were casters.
