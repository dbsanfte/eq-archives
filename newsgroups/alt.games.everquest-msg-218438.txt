I followed it, and thought it made the point very well, which was
that it was a strain to follow even as simple a case as yours.

WIth multiple points being made and discussed, it would be even
more incomprehensible.

Also, your subthread followed a pattern; real threads with some
top posters and some bottom posters are harder to follow because
there's no pattern at all.
