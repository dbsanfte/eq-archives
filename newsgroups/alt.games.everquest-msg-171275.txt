Note that your max swim skill is capped at level*5+5, so once
you hit that you won't be able to gain any further skill while
swimming until you hit the next level.  And the "lifetime" cap
for swimming is 200.

You learn by listening, and *only* in group-chat.  You'll see
messages every once in a while saying that your language skill
has increased.  Note, however, that your numeric skill in that
language will not go up, nor will you actually be able to understand
or speak the language better until you zone or camp and then
re-enter the game.

I did some tests, and the volume of text being spoken to you
does not matter, only the number of "lines" you receive.  So
it's usually faster (and a lot less clutter) to use "language
lesson" lines which are short instead of verbose.
