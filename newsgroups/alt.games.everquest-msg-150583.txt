Was any of the LD characters aggroed? When LD, chars behave like NPCs,
and if they are attacked, they will fight back by swinging (not
casting if casters). There used to be a bug where if a char who was LD
got the kill shot, then the corpse would poof, since they are
technically NPCs while LD. Don't know if this was ever fixed or not,
but if not, it would explain what happened.
