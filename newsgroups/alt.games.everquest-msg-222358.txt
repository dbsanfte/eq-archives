OK, so please tell me, a stupid 20th level mage, why having the rogue means
that you do not want the earth pet.  The air pet has invisibility, is the
rogue going to presume some sort of stealth-invisibility thing? The earth
pet casts root (or something like it, the words are different) and the rogue
does backstab, so does the root cause the backstab to not work? I have
noticed that monsters seem to be able to spin on a dime and attack
whomsoever they will.  I do not think that I have a real GOOD reason to pick
air, nor a real reason NOT to choose earth, in fact if the problem was the
healing powers of the cleric, then I think that I would have chosen water!
