That's because *you* are not affected by the song. If you were in a PvP
situation (duel, arena, whatever), your opponent would be seeing the icon.
If there were working bard npcs (which there don't seem to be) you could
kick one and see firsthand what the CoD "buff" icon looked like.  It's
just like for druids, shaman, necros, and everyone else who relies on dots.
If you dot a mob, you don't get an icon for it, but the target will.

Nope. CoD (and other bard dots) are really 18-second dots that refresh
every tick as long as you continue to play. Like all other dots, you will
see a message each time you land the dot ("An elite gnoll winces"), but
you do *not* get any messages when it deals its regular damage each tick.
You can test this out easily on mobs in the newbie areas if you like. Start
CoD with a bat in range, turn it off. When you get the "CoD wears off"
message, start it back up and turn it off after the bat winces. You can
kill the bat with the dot even if you're not actively playing it at the
moment.

You are correct though in that those bard songs which only work while
pulsing (Bellows, Mana Song, Locate Corpse, Mellifluous Motion) do not get
buff icons. Nor do a few other goofy ones -- faction song lasts until you
zone, camp or play it again for a different faction.

Nothing quite as exciting as aggroing the guards on the other side of the
city walls, starting a guard train after you. But I wouldn't know that
from personal experience, that was some other bard who just happened to
look like me! Honest!
