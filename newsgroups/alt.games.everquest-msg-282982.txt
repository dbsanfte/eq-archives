If you run WinEQ, only one folder is necessary. It has support for
handling multiple "eqclient.ini" files, so you can run instances with
different settings.
I recommend it, the basic version has all the features you need to
multibox (configurable keys to switch windows, quicker and easier than
alt-tabbing).
