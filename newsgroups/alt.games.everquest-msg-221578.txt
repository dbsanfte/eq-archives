I think we do look back and feel a lot of the fun of learning isnt
there, it is kind of handed to you on a plate, they now get a "read
the message in your inventory and hand it to me" message, they get
their spells pre-mem'd they get hot keys premade, their weapon is auto
equip'd

They've also added a huge amount at the high end, now I finally have a
65 of course Im semi glad otherwise Id be probably cursing the fact
that I could only have got to 60 with endless months in the older
zones where in fact you go to Valor or HoH and it doesnt take so long.

I think there are many styles of playing EQ. Some want to get 65 asap,
(remember the 65 cleric with epic in around 36 hours?), some love
questing, some dont, some tradeskill some dont..

I look back and a lot of what really facinated me about eq was the
challenges, such as the FP->Qeynos run, (in the dark no sow, no
reliable map, no nothing), spending what seemed like weeks on orc
hill, the months it seemed in crushbone. That ubber feeling of finally
having a peice of armor even cloth in every slot!  The thought going
into waying up which spells I could afford and which order to buy them
in

I remember feeling scared to zone to places Id never been because it
probably meant a long long ride somewhere. I also remember the feeling
of awe of anyone 50+ as they were god like, Id never have dreamed of
sending the tells I seem to get "d00d give me yr plat" .....
