 Im not offended at all.....but its not going to change the way i play. In a SW
group in the overthere you are out in the open...mobs wander by...and a sitting
shaman with low to mid health= lunch...and unless your twinked out or with a
group of good taunters...this will lead to a quick death. I was lvl 29 at the
time as well so the high 30 lvl rhino was not going to be missing much....and
at lvl 29 untwinked my max HPS are aound 630..so at 40% that would bring my
health to around 250ish.....now rhino hit for about 30-70ish and have 3?
attacks....and also attack fairly quick...how long is that 250hps going to
last? Just my opinion but i think cannablize is a great tool for soloing to
lower downtime...or to get some quick mana to pop off a heal when your
oom...hmm im a bad shaman?
