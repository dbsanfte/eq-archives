In response to Blizzard making a new game.... this reminds me that the
reason i switched to EQ is we are all still waiting on the 1.10 patch for
Diablo II which was due out over a year ago..... hmmmm cheating rampant on
BattleNet and Blizzard has done nothing to stop it.  So in that respect i
don't think i will be playing any more games from blizzard.
