Right.  The wall guards in Misty Thicket are still tough kills for
a solo 51 rogue (tough as in you can kill 'em, but you'll have to
heal afterwards.  The actual Rivervale guards (Vastlin and
Tagil) are level 50 and will eat you for lunch at 60.

Heck, my rogue is ally in all of Rivervale (except clerics), and
I STILL kill the annoying wall guards sometimes, payback for
all the times they stole my almost-dead-even-/con goblin at
level 7.
