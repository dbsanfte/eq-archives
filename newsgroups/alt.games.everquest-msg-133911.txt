    No. PotG's only conflicts are with buffs with mana regen in a certain
slot (so a cleric's self-buff and a mage's self-buff), and stuff in the Skin
Like or Valor line (all the way up to Aegolism). A wizard's mana regen buff,
the rune effect off their epic, stacks with PotG.

    At 58, yeah I can see that. But at 60, when you get Aegolism, you
generally switch over to Aego + BAotR. It's just soooo much easier.
