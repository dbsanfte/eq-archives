  Weirdness last night--I got on the shuttles from Butcherblock to get on 
the Maiden's Voyage. So far, so good. My shuttle missed the boat ramp 
somehow, so I jumped off and managed to clamber onto the prow of the 
boat. I clung on for dear life for the entire trip and made it into 
the Firiona Vie zone alive. 
   Here's the odd part. When the boat finally started moving again, it 
seemed to run into the land and freeze up next to the large fort with the 
statue of Firionia herself in it. It didn't start moving again until I 
moved forward onto dry land.
   I appreciated being able to bypass the docks and all, but it was still 
pretty unnerving. I kept expecting to fall through the world or get eaten 
by Faydedar back in Timorous Deep...
