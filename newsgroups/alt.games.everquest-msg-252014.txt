I thought about mentioning that camp since it's my favorite 'quick'
solo spot if I'm just killing time waiting on some friends to get on.
About half of the mobs there are light blue at 65 but it's convenient
and the money's good.  The reason I didn't mention it is that 2 pull
you saw as the 2nd pull. I didn't think a 63 could break that.

Assuming the mage's 'pet swarm' AA works like the shaman version, have
you considered using buying that for help with soloing? For the shaman
version, even lvl 1 will get you 3 lvl 58 pets with 2k hitpoints that
last for a minute.  You can pull by targetting one with the swarm AA
then peel off the 2nd one with a nuke and sic your real pet on him. 

The swarm should hopefully last long enough for you to kill the first
one. There's also a way to use 'pet hold' to pull but I never have
gotten the hang of that one, maybe someone else will comment on that. 

Rgds, Frank
