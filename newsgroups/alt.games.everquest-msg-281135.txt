Ah yes, my bad, I misread my source, thought it was all casters.

Yep, as I said, you'll probably get to use it once per fight at best, once
per every few mobs at worst and only one shot on each mob whatever.

>It didn't list duration:

Translocational Anchor - 3 Ranks - Cost: 3/6/9 AA/Rank - 5 Min Reuse -
Rereq: Level 70 - Activated ability
While under the effect of this ability, an NPC will not be able to gate
away from you. Additional ranks increase the duration of the effect. Level
1 - 2 ticks, Level 2 - 3 ticks, Level 3 - 4 ticks

From Graffe's.

Longer duration than I thought, 12 seconds minimum, 24 seconds maximum.
Depending on the mob and the group DPS, 24 seconds should be enough for any
gating mob unless it cheals in between gates as well.
