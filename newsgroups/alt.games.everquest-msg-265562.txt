I think you must be very confused. When 'my' needs and desires are 
consistent with convention, which they are. Then my needs and desires 
are representative of the player bases at large. And the whole online 
gaming universe DOES revolve them.

In point of fact, what I think is killstealing is precisely what the 
conventions of CoH say is killstealing.

Talk about a deliberate use of quoting out of context.

I clarified how EQ worked. Interestingly, if you think about it, EQs 
mechanics actually make killstealing impossible because the person that 
does the most damage gets the xp. So it goes to whoever earned it. And 
if you earned it you get the xp. And thus there is no killstealing in EQ 
either.

See any flaws in that logic? (I mean other than the fact that its widely 
known that killstealing is a non-trivial problem in EQ).

The same structure of argument applies equally to CoH, by the way. And 
defending the notion that killstealing doesn't exist in CoH, holds up 
about as well as it does for EQ.

So 'killstealing' in CoH is 'harrassment' then. A rose by anyother

You can filter via channels and via ignore lists in most games. Doing so 
tends to result in you missing out on information you *do* want. Its a 
no-win situation. Ignore is suitable for filtering out one gibbering 
idiot... its not suitable for filtering out some moronic bush v kerry 
debate in a large region.

Filtering major channels tends to result in you missing information you 
DO want, thereby 'infringing on your enjoyment of the game' from the 
other side.

Uh... doing -what- repeatedly? 

"Attacking things I'm already fighting"? 

That is the very definition of how you try to 'kill steal'.

QED.

Seriously... how the heck can you stand there and say there is no 
killstealing in CoH, but if someone does it repeatedly then its 
harassment. How can it be harrassment to do something that doesn't 
exist? (regardless of how many times you do it!)

What does that have to do with -anything-?

Nice try. But now your just lying. The conventions exist in CoH.

They exist to the point that engaging "someone elses mobs" more than a 
couple times even amounts to "harrasment". 

The idea that killing mobs is harrasment is entirely founded on the idea 
that the mobs are 'yours' in some recognized way. Its not harrassment to 
hang out near you killing mobs... its harrassment hanging out near you 
killing YOUR mobs. The fact that he's killing mobs you are engaged with 
is a key element to this.

> Conventions in CoH ON'T SUPPORT ownership.

Really...? I think the veracity of that statement has been pretty much 
abolished.

And yet they still don't appreciate having their bosses sniped out from 
under them. No matter how much you jump and thrash, no matter how many 
asterisks you use, the simple truth is that killstealing exists in CoH, 
that player convention frowns on it, and that CS policy even describes a 
form of it as harrassment.

It has nothing to do with EQ. The problem is defined solely within CoH 
terms, and the conventions are solely those of CoH players. Stop 
thrashing about EQ biases; they simply aren't germane.

Kill stealing in CoH may not be nearly the magnitude of problem it was 
in EQ, but that isn't the same as saying it doesn't exist as a problem 
in CoH. It does exist, and CS should acknowledge that fact, and to an 
extent they even do via their harrassment policy. But of course, you 
have to know what to call it... because if you call it killstealing you 
get 'there is no killstealing in CoH form letter', which, to tie this 
back to the original thread, is poor customer service.
