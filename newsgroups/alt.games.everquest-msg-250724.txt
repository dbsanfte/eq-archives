EQ may have lost players to its own ineptitude with the DX9 engine
switch and GoD bugs, but virtually everyone I knew ingame who went to
CoH has now come back, telling stories of getting bored and missing
EQ.

As expected, all flash, no staying power.

There's more serious threats on the horizon, of course.

"Bad enough when the dead come walking," he said to Jon as they crossed
 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"

- Dolorous Edd Tollett, "Clash of Kings" (George R R Martin)
