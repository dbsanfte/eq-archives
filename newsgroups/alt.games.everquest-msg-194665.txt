The GeForce4 MX 440 card is basically a GeForce2 TI with a faster
clock (250MHz for the TI, 270MHz for the MX) and Lightspeed II memory
architecture.  Both have a 6.4 GByte/s memory bus and as would be
expected, the GeForce4 MX 440 can draw slightly more triangles/second
(34 million for GeForce4 MX 440, 31 milllion for GeForce2 TI).

As for your benchmarks, if you look at the following page from Tom's
Hardware http://www6.tomshardware.com/graphic/20020418/index.html you
will see that the GeForce2 GTS and GeForce4 MX 440 are about the same
in the first test, but the GeForce 4 MX 440 is much faster in all the
other tests.  Did you test against a GeForce4 MX 420 that uses SDRAM
and is much slower?

I bought the GeForce4 MX 440 because it was $60 and can run most games
in 32bit color at 1024x768 at 60 frames per second.  I can't really
justify spending $300 on a top of the line video card that will
probably be topped by another cheap $60 card when EQ2 comes out.
Anyway, don't buy a GeForce2 TI card.  NVidia has already moved it to
the legacy products part of their web-page and it doesn't make sense
to pay more for less.
