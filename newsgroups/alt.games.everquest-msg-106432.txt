But, say you give a warrior enough twink armor to reduce the damage he takes
per minute in half.  Now give a weapon that kills twice as fast.  You've cut
the damage he takes per mob by 75%.  So yes eventually you need to rest, but
by the time he needs to, regardless of hp, he's killed 4x as many mobs as an
un-twinked melee.  Add to that a down time reducer (even bandaids help with
this), and the melee is a non-stop leveling machine.  Thats where the
difference is.  Unless you could give a caster an item that made his spells
4 times as effective, you can't keep on par with the twinked melee.  He
might be able to go longer before resting, but the casters "mob per minute"
ratio won't change as dramatically.
