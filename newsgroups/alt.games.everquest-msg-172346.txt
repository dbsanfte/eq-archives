There are three DW goblins where you report them, however, only the two on the
sides are PH for corrupteds, and only the one in the center is PH for Lord
Berg.  Deep spawn is not connected to any of these, but does happen to also be
there in the top of the tower... so no AE nuking the trio if she's there.

The tainted do not always spawn corrupted, as you may have noted, making "kill
till you get one and then call a druid" a less than satisfying experience.

The PH for lord B spawns on a different timer than the tainted PH's, far more
slowly.  A cleric can easily single pull just the lord B PH if he likes, using
lull line spells if level pull doesn't cut it.  What to do during the tedious
downtime in between PH pops, when you are facing hours of waiting, is another
matter.  Personally, I killed the druid PH's too, and anything else I could find
down there, just to have something to do.  With a porter friend nowadays, you
might port to DS, go to ME and hunt, and gate back on the spawn... might be more
enjoyable.

Personally, I camped him with friends for about 3 weeks in short intervals, then
sat down one day and spent 14 hours doing the spawn on my own.  I believe on
average, 10 hours is more reasonable to expect.  Sucks either way.  If at all
possible, do the spawn in your 30s with a group when its an exp camp!
