Hmmm.  Maybe, I rarely read any of his posts after seeing about 10
in a row that were nothing but "I'm an extra-ignorant Wizard and
therefore I alone should rule EQ" whines.  I mean, there was some
nonsense there, but it was always the same thing repeated using the
same words, at least hughes did some serious thrashing and threw in
attempts to change the subject, even came up with new arguments
once in a while (sadly that's all history, the last post of his I
read made a great deal of sense, either that or I've drifted off
into lalaland with him).

David, what do you use for a newsreader?  Your replies (and only yours)
have been showing up unthreaded (i.e. as starting a new thread) in
Nutscrape for some months now.
