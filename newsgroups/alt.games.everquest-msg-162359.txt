Yes it is, and no it is not 100% required, at least in its present form.

Yes.  Or, to be more specific, I have a darned good idea just
how many arrows you can go through during a long play session
in which you act as a dedicated archer.  I've done it, with
the quickest bow I could get, on a couple of characters when I
decided to deal with a badly lagging Archery skill.  The first
time I did it I took a Warrior out with 7 backpacks and his
fletching kit, he had one stack each of food and drink, every
other slot had a stack of arrows in it, 64 stacks = 1280 arrows.
And I agree with your implication:  if arrow consumption is not
mitigated Archery is severly limited (fletching 1000+ arrows per
play session would definitely by a huge pain in the ass).  But
it does not follow that arrow consumption must be zero.

There is no good reason I can see for Endless Quiver to be a
"forever and always" deal.  Do you honestly believe that if,
for example, EQ had a 5% chance of failure you would be unable
to carry sufficient arrows?  For that matter, why in hell is
EQ an all-or-nothing level to 59 and get a ton of AA thing?
Archers ought to have a chance of "reagent conservation" that
scales with class and level (Ranger always better than anybody,
knights always worse than anybody), which would represent the
recovery of missiles from the battlefield (and higher quality
arrow should give a bonus to the skill).  Anyhow, my point is
that it is not necessary for a Rangers ammo consumption to be
zero.
