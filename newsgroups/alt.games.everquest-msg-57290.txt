Depends on the server.

Zeb was 88, now it's 91.

Why the hell did they do this to us?  And more importantly, why the hell
didn't they TELL us?  I think this is the 3rd time I've had to dive into my
system to change this stuff.   For ME that's easy, I'm an old DOS man, but
hell, there are LOTS of players who are afraid to even double click on My
Computer.
