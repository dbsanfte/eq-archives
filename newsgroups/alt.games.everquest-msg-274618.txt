You do need to be in a guild as far as I know.
If you are flagged as a patron you gain guild and personal status.
If you are flagged as a follower you only gain personal status.

IIRC there was something about having a guild for the un-guilded - it
wouldn't necessarily gain in levels but it would allow people to get
personal status.  Not sure if this was a suggestion by the EQ2 player base
or an idea being floated by development.

You can also gain personal status by completing heritage quets too, ie the
journey is half the fun.
