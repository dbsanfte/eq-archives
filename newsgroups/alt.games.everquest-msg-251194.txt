Funny you should say that.  Our guild suffered a loss of our best geared
players to Lineage2.  I couldn't figure out why.  I played it - hated it.
But when I was chatting w/ one of them on Trillian yesterday it boiled down
to these two things - the buggy content of Uqua (I know what he meant by
that, I've nearly deleted my character because of it - I hate being a tester
on a live server) and the fact that L2 is ok if you like to take all the
satisfaction from others.  They play because they love messing with the "i
am god" guys of L2.  Basically...they like to smack them down.  I'm not a
PvP person.  I just don't see the fun in it.

But they've all said the same thing - when EQ gets better, they will come
back.
