Well, I forgive that when it's a newbie in a newbie zone and I'm running 
around buffing people or just goofing.  That's happened a lot to me and I 
always figure that perhaps they haven't had the ingame experience to 
understand why it's something they shouldn't do.  Can't get annoyed with 
them over that.

Level 65s in the upper planes, however, don't get the same pass.
