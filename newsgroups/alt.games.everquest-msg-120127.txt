Have you tried doing the katta faction quests?  I haven't seen any evidence
that the vampire killing moves faction much at all, but with the quests
I moved up pretty fast... of course I was never KOS in the first place

Depending on your race you may be able to use Sneak to complete the
quests, or you may need a charmer to make the quest guy indifferent
to you so you can do it the first couple times to get past KOS
