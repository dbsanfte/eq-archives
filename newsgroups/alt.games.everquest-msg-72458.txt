No.

Since level 29 (now 35)  my druid has made about 400pp on ports.

However, the best idea is to wait til 34 when you get the DL port, many
people want that port, also, sitting somewhere like great divide or just
outside KC and porting to WC is also one of the more profitable runs.

Also, there's no way you can kill the AC at level 35 fast enough to avoid
being KSed by the level 40+ people there camping it  (the Sro one, the OOT
one is just plain too high for you)
