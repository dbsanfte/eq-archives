Question-
      I know that mobs that give experience but in past conned green, now
con light blue,
Is there an experience penalty on them? and what is the exact level
difference (for 50+
level characters) where dark blue stops and light blue starts.

     If I am level 55 then level 40 mobs con dark blue, correct? and give
there full exp
What level mobs con light blue and what percent of their normal exp to they
give?

Calculation
    I used one of the charts that tells how much exp you need to accomplish
each level. these charts also list how many mobs you need to solo of that
particular level to advance a level. From those charts
I was able to determine that, everything being equal,  a mob which is one
level higher than another mob gives 5% more experience.  In other words you
get approximetly the same experience from killing 19 level 41mobs as 20
level 40, assuming they both con the same color to you.
