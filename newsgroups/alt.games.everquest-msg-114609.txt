yep and a fantastic reason to play HALFLING RANGERS. I can't wait for 
Kayne Bayle, the new unsplit blue server in Europe coming on may 15th.
I bet there will be about a million halfling rangers.. ahaha.

Besides, why would a halfling ranger need the time of day from ANOTHER

people to group with. Its not like a group is going to want TWO
rangers in it.
