He didn't mean he got good XP; he just had a good experience with a guide.

I think that's terrific myself.  There's a slight possibility he was
checking to make sure he weren't using a macroing product to automate your
tradeskills.  But the most likely explanation is that the guide saw someone
diligently working on tradeskills - which can at times be mind-numbingly
dull - and decided to provide a minor diversion in the form of some tasty GM
food and a harmless display of fireworks.

I wish more Guides had time to do stuff like that; it can really brighten
someone's EQ day.  =)

Back in the days when I actually had to take a boat to get to Kunark
(/shudder), I'd pass the time running around the boat, jumping off the poop
deck, and making what I thought in my delusion to be witty remarks.  ("Dang,
I've jumped off the deck a thousand times and my Safe Fall hasn't gone up
yet!")  One thing I learned is if you went belowdecks and jumped onto the
bar, then faced the side of the ship and walked forward, you would pop up
through the ceiling and end up on the deck.  I had fun showing other people
this trick, too.  It's amazing what you'll do to pass the time during an
hour-long voyage.  :)
