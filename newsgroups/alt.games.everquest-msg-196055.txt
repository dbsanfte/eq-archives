I fixed that problem by downloading the patch, NOT starting the game,
opening the zone alarm (freebie version) control panel, going to
program control and checking all EQ related programs as trusted (the
patch-altered ones will have a ? instead of a trusted checkmark).

Now my only problem is convincing Norton that when I uncheck the box
that asks to remind me to resubscribe every day, that means I do not
want to be reminded every day. Surefire EQ crasher, and always when I
least expect it. Stupid thing.
