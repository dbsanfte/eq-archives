Yes, it is.  The only thing you'll lose is a little mana efficiency on
Complete Heal, which you'll probably make back in aggro controlled healing.

Well, yes and no.   In a single group situation, a shadowknight is as
attractive as a warrior.   Some would argue more attractive.

The last holdout of warrior power is raids.    For what it sounds like
you're doing... planar raid armor farms, the odd epic fight, a shadow knight
or paladin can tank it every bit as well as a warrior could.   Maybe better.

The only place warriors really shine anymore is where you're fighting with
your entire raid vs. one single very hard mob.  In those situations, due to
/discipline defensive, a warrior can take the damage for that fight much
better.   Allowing your raid to kill the mob at a much earlier time (either
level wise or equipment wise) than you otherwise would.

More than ever before, warriors have become a one trick pony.  Raid tanking
big mobs.

Since returning to playing myself, I've become more and more discouraged
with the current state of warriors in the game. (I'll spare you the details,
unless someone really wants to hear it).   Luckily I had gotten my rogue up
to a moderately high level, and after buying her a new weapon, I've had a
lot of fun playing her.  I've probably played her twice as much as Dearic in
the last week.   Likely I'll continue to do that, and just pull him out if I
want to raid something nasty for some reason.
