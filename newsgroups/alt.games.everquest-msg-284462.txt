First I want to say that in no way do I endorse the plat for cash game. 
  I think its damaging, not just to the game or the game economy, but 
also to the fun you can have playing your character honestly; whatever 
you earn yourself is far more satisfying than what you can buy with 
outside cash.

But I've been interested in seeing how the comercial dealers would treat 
the new servers with their limited economies; after all, EQ is somewhat 
in decline, would they even bother with the harsh realities of a server 
where they can't just log in a level 65 they bought from someone 
quitting the game and go farm well known pp generators?

I haven't looked hard, but the few times I poked around, I found nothing 
at all, until today.  A google search turned up someone selling 10K on 
combine on EBay, but I don't credit EBay sales, I was looking for a 
professional organization.  Finally found one.

So as to not promote the place, I won't actually link it, but it had 
prices for cash on Combine as well as on other servers:

  Erollisi Marr - Platinum 100k   	 $27.05   	Buy Now
  Erollisi Marr - Platinum 200k  	 $53.05  	Buy Now
  Erollisi Marr - Platinum 300k  	 $78.05  	Buy Now
  Erollisi Marr - Platinum 400k  	 $104.05  	Buy Now
  Erollisi Marr - Platinum 500k  	 $128.05  	Buy Now
  Erollisi Marr - Platinum 1000k  	 $250.05  	Buy Now

  The Sleeper - 5000 platinum  	 $125.05  	Buy Now
  The Sleeper - 3000 platinum  	 $201.05  	Buy Now

Yes, 3K costs more than 5K, funny.  I'm guessing thats a glitch, but its 
not a confidence inspiring one.

Look at the difference in what they're offering on a real server and on 
the Progression ones; 500kpp versus 3000pp!

It would take someone more interested than I was to fish around for 
other plat vendors and find their prices to do a real comparison study, 
but I'll wager the same basic idea will hold true, even though they both 
buy the same number of peridot, 10K on Combine is worth, in real world 
dollars, and in blood sweat and tears for that matter, ten times what 
100Kpp is on a developed server.

Makes me feel better about the paltry 1200pp I have in the bank:)
