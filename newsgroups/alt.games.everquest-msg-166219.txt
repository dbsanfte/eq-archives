Actually, I suspect it originates from the 80's 'warez' scene
of pirate BBS's... at least, thats the first time I saw it. As
an illegal subculture it developed as a means of identifying
fellow members, obfusicating (marginally) what was being
discussed from non members, and spread via peer imitation.

This was the time of 300 baud modems, where 'real-time' chat
was slower than you could actually type, so the abbreviations
probably also stem from that. With the popularisation of hacker
culture in various books and movies, and the pirates, thieves,
hackers, heros, whatever you want to call them, spreading into
online gaming with the internet they became the cool kids
to emulate in the teen online scene.

Anyway, merely because someone is trying to convey information
doesnt mean they're trying to convey that information to *you*. Whilst
hacker sp33k may well tell you you dont want to group with this
person it equally may well tell another hax0r apprentice
that they *do*.

Or may have once, anyway. Thats my theory, and I'm sticking
with it.

Shrug. It does seem silly to take offense to it. Avoid it sure, but
its pretty similar to taking offense to people having long hair,
wearing flourescent clothing, or generally not being like you or
wanting to include you in their 'scene'.

Poor you. I'm sure you'll miss their company. I'm sure they'll
miss yours.
