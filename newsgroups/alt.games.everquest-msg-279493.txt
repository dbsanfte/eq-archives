No, my BL doesn't match my mage for pure DPS -- but he's in the same
ballpark and brings slow, mana regen, haste etc. to the table.

As a BL with pre-elemental gear I operated as MT in Tier 3 PoP,
primary slower in the sewers (Purifying Plant) over the enchanter,
mainly because I didn't wait until the mob was under 70% to slow.

I also occasionally offtanked those mobs with the druid healing me
while the cleric healed the warrior.

On my BL I found getting PU groups far easier than getting them on
my mage because of all the extras he brought to the table.
