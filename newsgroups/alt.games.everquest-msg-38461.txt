I don't think it can be done the way you want it done.  It should be
possible to create a hotbutton that would deliver a set tell to your target,
but the message would have to be preprogrammed, Ex: "/tell %T All your base
are belong to us!"

What I think you're asking is if you can make a button that gives you a
/tell [targetname] on the chatbar so you can just type out your message.  I
don't think that can be done.  If someone sends you a tell, hit r and you
will get "/tell [sender's name]" on the chatbar, but it only works to reply,
you can't initiate a conversation with this method.

If, however, there is a particular message you find yourself wanting to use
often, like "/tell %T Thank you!" you should be able to set it up on a
social.
