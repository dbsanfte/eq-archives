I don't mind people asking for buffs so much, or even teleports,
within reason.  I TP'ed into N. Karanas the other day when I got a
tell from a gentleman asking for a TP to West Commons.  I was helping
a guildie out at the time so I couldn't help him out and when I told
him this he begged me to give him a lift because he had been trying to
get a teleport to WC for two hours.

Two hours.  No, I realize that as an ogre warrior there were issues
with getting past guards, but even if he went the LONG way through SK,
Lake Rathe, past the evil cities, and up the Ro's, the trip itself
would have only take half an hour.  People like this I have little use
for.

And as for plat beggars, this irritates me to no end.  I have not once
in my 65 days played, EVER asked begged for plat.  Every item and
copper I have I earned, and yes I do resent these people who seem to
expect me to give them stuff.

Could be I'm just an asshole, but there you go.  :-)
