What you might need is a new monitor, a new graphics card, new graphic
drivers or all three of them.

Some people are more sensitive to the frequency rates of monitors. A low
refresh rate (60, 75Hz) can cause headaches with some people. Sometimes the
videocard is not able to supply a higher refresh rate at the current
resolution, sometimes the monitor cannot go any higher then a certain
refresh rate.

Another problem could be that your drivers are not DirectX certified causing
the screen to switch back to 60Hz when playing any type of game. This can be
solved with newer (or older) drivers. This seems to be happening more
frequently with Geforce cards from NVidia. There is however a refreshrate
fix tool out somewhere.... i can't tell you where to find it though....

Another thing could be the radiation emitted by some screens, especially
older ones. This cannot be solved with drivers but you'll have to replace
the monitor.

Consider a TFT flatscreen. These screens do not have the refresh problem as
they always look extremely sharp. They also emit hardly any if any radiation
at all. Another bonus is that they fit a lot better on your deskspace..... I
am extremely happy with my 17" flatpanel.... and 3D games run smoothly on
it.
