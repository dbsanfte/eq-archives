Solo goblins in Sol A.  Finesteel weapons, along with some incredibly 
common stackable stuff that adds up, and you should be able to pick up some 
nice xp as well.  Watch your step, falling in the lava sucks ;)

I'd pull to the Sol B zoneline near the Lavastorm entrance til you get the 
hang of the zone, then move down into the pit once you're comfortable.

There's quite a few casters in there, and the wizards are a REAL pain in 
the ass, but they're far enough between you should be alright.

With a few more you could probably take the rooms and mobs that actually 
have decent drops.
