I have a level 32 dark elf enchanter on The Tribunal, and I'd like to know
what equipment the NG suggests I should upgrade now that I've finally
replaced every piece of raw silk gear. This is my main character, so no uber
suggestions please, although I do manage to earn pretty good plat from various 
things like selling Steins of Moggok (still sell for 200+ here on The Tribunal
even after PoP made it so much easier), camping the ancient croc in Upper Guk 
for Gatorscale and just normal looting.

Currently I have a good assortment of focus items, but my resists are a bit
low. This is my current gear:

Ear: 2 x Golden Sapphire Earring
Neck: White Gold Necklace
Head: Batfang Headband
Face: Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid Mask
Chest: Blackened Crystalline Robe
Back: Joined Ethereal Cape
Arms: Gatorscale Sleeves
Shoulders: Frozen Mantle
Wrists: Bracelet of Woven Grass, Jaded Electrum Bracelet
Waist: Braided Cinch Cord
Hands: Incandescent Gloves
Fingers: Band of Rodcet Nife, Fine Antique Ring
Legs: Hand Woven Leggings
Feet: Kobold-hide Boots
Primary: Black Tome with Silver Runes
Secondary: Stein of Moggok
Range: Beginner Magic Manual (bought the Hobgoblin Surprise for 250PP)

The obvious choices for replacements are wrists, shoulders, legs. Maybe you
can tell that I like questing for equipment, however I feel I've already
done most of the good ones for a chanter at my level.

What are your suggestions?
