It *almost* did me. The only thing that got me past the initial disgust 
at the graphics was the fact that I desperately wanted a MMORPG with 
some content and story behind it. Once I simply accepted the graphics 
for what they were, I could live with them. Although, I LOVE the 
updates. I'm playing a Gnome Magician right now and they look soooooo 
much better than the boxy version of the originals.
