Well that does seem like a disproof.

My gut feeling is that on each swing, there is a chance of proc, and that
this chance of proc is based on the proc itself combined with your dex.
Thus haste will simply mean more swings per minute, more chances of proc
per minute.

It is clear that proc rate is a variable, look at the cleric hammer series
for the clearest example, identicle weapons with the only change being the
proc rate.

But some clerics are reporting the same procs per minute regardless of
their haste status, which would indicate that contrary to my gut feeling,
something is countering haste.

Perhaps somehow the proc chance calculation is affected by weapon plus dex
minus haste?

Another thought that might account for your observation, though, is that
all your double hit may work like this:  timer is still running, neither
hit nor double attack hit check for proc.  Timer is up, both hit and
double attack hit check for proc.

Your observation on dual weild is irrelevant, since that would be a second
weapon in your off hand, which would of course be using its own
independant clock.  (well not "of course" but probably)
