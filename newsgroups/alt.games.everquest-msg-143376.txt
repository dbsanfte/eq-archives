Don't quite understand why you're stating this difference. I already
have my equipment- best I can get. I can't solo effectively, and
certainly not better than an unguilded L60 with a few AA in the classes
you mentioned.

Grey I could solo, as long as I left all the named pops for someone
else.

FG I can, and have, soloed. Even with the best of equipment, my DPS are
too slow to make it worthwhile.

Never tried Katta, since it took me forever to raise faction there in
the first place, plus I had to use the 4 shards from Seru for the Arx
Key. Would like to keep faction for the final Seru earring one of these
days.

None of the above zones would allow me to 'get more exp in a given time
period' than any of the listed classes, regardless of what I'm killing. 

Using a shaman bot, I can chain pull in just about any exp zone
(including CT), but I'm still crippled for soloing by low DPS because
I'm NOT a damage class.

WIZ, DRU,

Can quad kite with minimal gear, then med up ready to go again, faster
than I could EVER dream of soloing. Buy a KEI, and they're a machine.

 SHM,

Only one of your listed classes that probably couldn't solo way ahead of
me, though with canni5 and torpor they have almost limitless mana.

 MAG,

Can solo in Seb for obscene amounts of exp, bordering on what I can get
in a full group, let alone soloing.

 NEC.

Don't know many high level necs any more, but those soloing in Akheva
don't seem to complain about the exp.


Please confirm that you are saying I can outsolo the above classes
(possibly excepting shaman) over time, giving an example of where I
should be killing.


OOOH!!! I've thought of one! I can solo the Rift mobs in Ssra! Blue con,
rather low hps, non agro! Shame the repop is so slow, or I might have to
concede defeat in this debate.
