Playing almost exclusively melees, I have a lot of undercons:

  Hill and sand giants
  Sceptres
  Griffin types
  Any wizard (think festering hags in Unrest)

But my biggest personal undercon is Obretl in South Ro.  Completely green to
my 43 ranger, I ended up with a sliver of life before finishing him off.

Biggest overcons:

  Bloodgill goblins in LOIO.
