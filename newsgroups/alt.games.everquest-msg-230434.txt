4% better haste for you, 5% better slow from you, and for an epic which 
is one of the easiest in the game to do?  Plus you could use your LDoN 
points for something other than that haste item?

Beastlords solo quite well, something a 5% better haste would certainly 
help with 100% of the time (remember that 55% is actually 10% less 
damage taken than 50%... its better than it sounds)

Sounds like its worth it to me... the real deal breaker would be if you 
could be weilding a much better weapon instead, or if you get a better 
slow than 55% or a better haste item than 40%, or if you almost always 
have a haste buff that puts you over your haste cap with just the 36% haste.

Or if the beastlord epic was harder than say camping the Aegis of Life. 
  Since I've been in groups which have done all the beastlord fights, 
single group, in one day, I don't think you can characterize it as a lot 
of effort.
