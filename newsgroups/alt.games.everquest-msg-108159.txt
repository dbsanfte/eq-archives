Yeah!  Thats the way!  You are against "PLing" a "monk" with a Fungi, but
damnit, go and buy one.  You see my friend, some people DONT like to
disregard the rules set forth by VI/SOE.  Fungi's go against NO rules,
UNLESS you are monopolizing a zone, BUT, that is the player NOT the item
that said player has.

Yep.. and its the guns that kill people not the person pulling the trigger.

I ALWAYS do.  So, what does this have to do with nerfication of an item?

Good for you, SERIOUSLY.  When you obtain level 60 with one of them, get
some other 60 friends, go after king until you all have a fungi, then you
will have earned that too.  According to most, if not yourself, twinking is
"bad," so DONT DO IT at all.  But, wait... could you go without twinking at
all?  If so GREAT.  You enjoy the game in a different manner.  BUT, I am not
going to even TRY to criticize you for that and crucify you.  You pay your
$12.95 a month just as I do, you enjoy the game as you wish.  However, I
believe my question was.. how does the effects of the Fungi Tunic at ANY
level affect YOU DIRECTLY?  Disregard the person behind the computer, as my
friend, we are all different people.

Not that hard for some.  Totally irrelevant, or is it...?  My guild is
pitching FT3 items left and right, assuming we dont have a guild friend
along that WE feel has EARNED the right to that item.  No, just being 60
doesnt qualify someone as earning it.  It would have to be someone who can
USE and NOT abuse the item.  Sure, there are some out there that abuse their
powers as you mentioned above, but remember, its the PERSON -not- the item.
