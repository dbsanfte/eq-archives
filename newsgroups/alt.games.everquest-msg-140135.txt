}The server and channel have been plastered all over the groups..

Not this one.  A google search for the appearance of irc.uicn.net in 
alt.games.everquest returns only the post I am replying to here.  and 
presumably it'll now return this one as well.  You didn't really think I 
was going to go wander around other groups looing for the info when I 
could browbeat you into providing it, did you?

}But, I will indulge your inane idiocy..

}what excuse you'll come up with next...

My excuse?  I'm sitting in your channel.  But surely you knew that.
