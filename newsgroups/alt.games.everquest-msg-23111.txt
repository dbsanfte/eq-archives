But, if stats don't matter, why do you do this?  The issue isn't whether
the weapon's proc is useless under these circumstances, its whether
an extra hundred dex makes a noticable difference in proc rate.  The
primal proc makes an excellent example, if someone has a dex of say
100, and rarely procs, then suddenly jumps to 200 and "continues
to proc like mad" then we might guess that there is  a marked difference
in proc rate with a healthy dex boost. A 5% increase would not result
in "procs like mad," in fact you'd need a couple days worth of logs
and a good log parser to detect it at all.
