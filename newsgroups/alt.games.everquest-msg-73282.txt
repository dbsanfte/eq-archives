Then you're delusional. Only the very biggest sites that can show a
massive, cross-demographic client base can manage to break even on the
"banner ad" revenue that was touted early in the internet marketing age.
(porn excepted, of course. Still the only reliably profitable business
of "click through" on the net.)

Lots of companies that bet their asses on internet advertising revenue
have had said asses handed to them on a platter. Trust me. Part of our
business is monitoring those trends and publishing summaries on them.
