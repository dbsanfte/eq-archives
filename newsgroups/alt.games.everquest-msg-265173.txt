Hmm, can't figure that one out. If you did the fan club thing you should 
have posting rights. There generally is some email verification step that's 
involved somewhere, did you do that? I suspect that's a part of the fan club 
step but it might be something you do back on the forums before you can 
post. Check you profile and account options.

Don't think it's just beta testers because there's been a public forum all 
along. Unless something's changed recently.
