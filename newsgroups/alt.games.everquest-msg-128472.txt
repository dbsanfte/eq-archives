Being an Enchanter (31) I have not found a good way to do this. The thing
that works
best for me has been to have the tank pull from a distance away, I assist
him, and cast
the area mez spell. It stops all of the mobs, and he pulls the one he wants.
Works for
adds too, but your tank has to recognize what you are doing and be ready to
step a few
steps back. Then you can move around till the one you want mez'd is closest
and use
the target closest button.
Watch out tho, the area mez will make them agro on you when they break. So
try to be
far enough away that you can mez them before they get to you.
