I am appalled at their response to this.

However, when I read the response, I did not get out of it that they were 
accusing you of cheating, merely saying that that is how people go about 
getting around doing the entire quest.

I know how I felt when my first tear turn in went bad due to a spawning 
bug.  We were fighting Rak outside the building with three mage pets, it 
was going reasonably well, when a black reaver suddenly spawned on top of 
us mid fight.  I belonged to a great guild at the time, they were very 
supportive, and although I and others had petitioned regarding the tear, 
we went back to Fear and I had another tear two days later.  We then 
tried again, this time with two mage pets.  The fight went horribly, we 
lost, and in the end, he despawned.

Fortunately, another day or two later, while camping some cleric epic mob 
in Lake Rathe for a friend, I was contacted by a GM, and they replaced my 
original tear, and we succeeded on my third attempt at Rak.

There is no question in my mind that they should have done the same for 
you.  They train you with all the other quests in EQ that you need enough 
faction to do a quest, never have I heard of one that you can have too 
much faction for.  If they are going to make such a quest, they have to 
somehow let players know about it.
