You forgot to mention that these so called "cheating" mobs who are now 
"SMARTER than your average PLAYER" still don't group rush PC's when they 
are obviously in sight, as you would assume they would if they had more 
intelligence. Think how hard it would be to fight in crushbone  for 
example if all the orcs in the vicinity cried battle and rushed your 
group which was picking on one of their kind.
