Heh ... I for one think the concept of a place where lowbie good charcters
can hang out and bank near the swamp is a good thing.  Particularly if some
of the new zones are going to be off the swamp.

I know, I know ... there's always the PoK.  But sometimes I just don't want
to deal with the framerate and lag issues of the PoK just to bank.
