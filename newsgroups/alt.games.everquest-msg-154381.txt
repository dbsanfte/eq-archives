I could just as easily say that Enchanters have been asking for new
illusions for years, only to be told that there's no more room in the global
models file, then see things like Shamans getting bear form, or Beastlord
warders and Wizard familiars being added, or the necro spectre pet.  But I
won't.

Instead, I'll just point out that nobody has had anything taken away from
them by this.  All that has happened is that someone has been given
something.  So stop whining.
