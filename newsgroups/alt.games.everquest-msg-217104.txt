	There was a time a while (quite a while) back that I ran into
some interesting lore info about the trist between Mayong and
Tserrina.  Recently this subject has come up on the Beastlord forums,
and I am completely unable to find it again.  

If you have any links or info on this would you be so kind as to post
it in response here.  Thank you.

Oh, and if you have any other choice links for Norath Lore, id much
appreciate them as well.

For those of you with lore intrest, here are a few links I have.
