>I must be a total trekkie because I recognized Leonard Nimoy right away.
  Proof that he should never ever be allowed to sing.  My main reaction
is WTF is Leonard Nimoy doing singing?

If you had ever listened to the Dr. Demento show, you'd have heard it
before. I was slightly upset that it wasn't included in the soundtrack. I
think I told Jak if it wasn't I didn't want to go see the film.

But then, I've got a good friend who has Spock's album (the whole thing) on
vinyl.
