>How do I dye my Armor?

First step: Don't crosspost

Second step: Buy the Legacy of Ykesha exansion if you don't already
have it. Without it, you can't dye armor (except Fine Steel, but
that's a different method and only applies to the specific piece.
Unlike LoY's armor dying, which applies to anything you put in that
equip slot, and doesn't "stick" to the armor if you give/sell it.)

Third: Buy or make a Vial of Prismatic Dye for each slot you want to
color (several fan sites have the recipes, or 40-50p per at the
Bazaar. Don't pay more than that. I've seen some nutjobs charging an
upwards of *150!!!!* per vial)

Fourth: Type /body, adjust the slot color where you want it, then
click "save".
