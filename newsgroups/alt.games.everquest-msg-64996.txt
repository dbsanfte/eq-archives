I have been experimenting with the 16 and 32 bit settings in the .INI
or Client file, cant see much if any difference.

The new textures look good up close with either setting, but lose
resolution quickly with distance, this applies to player chars, the
mobs seem to look about the same at close range as well as at some
distance.

Comments?
