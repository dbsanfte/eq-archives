You sure that's necessarily where the term "car" came from? 

Etymonline.com says:
car - 1301, "wheeled vehicle," from Norm.-Fr. carre, from L. carrum, 
carrus (pl. carra), orig. "two-wheeled Celtic war chariot," from Gaul. 
karros, from PIE *krsos, from base *kers- "to run." Extension to 
"automobile" is 1896. Car-sick first recorded 1908, on model of sea sick. 
U.S. carport is from 1939. Car bomb first 1972, in reference to Northern 
Ireland. Car pool is 1942 (n.), 1962 (v.). 

Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary states:
Etymology: Middle English carre, from Anglo-French, from Latin carra, 
plural of carrum, alteration of carrus, of Celtic origin; akin to Old 
Irish & Middle Welsh carr vehicle; akin to Latin currere to run

Dictionary.Reference.com states its origin as:
Middle English carre, cart, from Old North French, from Latin carra, pl. 
of carrus, carrum, a Gallic type of wagon. See kers- in Indo-European 
Roots.

I'll concede that the word "carriage" was mentioned once along with 
"charriot" and "cart" in the last alternate definition as well as in a 
couple other relationships drawn to other referenced phrases.

Sure, the word has, in reference to a chartoon character, anyway. I'm a 
bit long in the tooth compared to the majority of computer gamers, and 
I've never known it to be used commonly relative to video games.

I'd be interested to hear the real reason(s). I can't explain it 
otherwise. A mere need to be "different", maybe? That's pretty close to 
"hip" more often than not.
