I have a question for people out there. I played EQ for a while, then
stopped, mostly didn't have time to play. Well, I started again
recently and all the servers seem pretty empty. I upgraded my machine
over Christmas and was thinking about trying EQ2, since that seems to
be where people are going.

So, my question is, will my upgraded machine run it?

It's an Athlon 2000XP, 512M Ram, 128M nVidia 5500FX video card. 

Is that enough to run the game decently? I know most of the bells and
whistles will be turned off, obviously, I just wonder if it can handle
it.

Thanks. And please, no 'screw EQ2 go with WoW or DAoC or whatever'
posts. Not interested in those, don't care about 'my game is better
than yours' flagwaving. :)
