Is it being a whiney little bitch to point out a nerf and how it impacts
gameplay?  If so, prepare for more whiney little bitching.  I don't deny
that I love the game and consider it to be one of the best games ever made. 
I also have no problems discussing the aspects of the game that I dislike,
and nerfs rank near the top of the list.  Just wait for the discussion on
the new alternate experience skills, as I'm pretty impressed by them so far.
