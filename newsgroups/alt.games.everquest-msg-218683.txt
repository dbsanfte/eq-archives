Fair enough.

At the end of the day though a market failure isn't effectively much 
different from a crafting failure. You can earn a skill up either way, 
and you lose your money either way.

I'd like to see banded armour and other 'useless' items become 
subcombines to something useful.

I'd also like to see most of the oldworld items become components to 
tradeskills or quests too though... just to add some value to all those 
old zones. But thats another story.
