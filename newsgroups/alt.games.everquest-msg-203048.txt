There's actually a variety of behaviors the mobs exhibit (or exhibited)
once they start running, depending on the particular flavor of mob AI
and whether or not the mob is a green con.  But most commonly, in my
experience anyway, is that if they are closer than the "flight limit"
they run, if they are further than that the charge, and when they are
at it they sort of dither, turning and taking a step this way and that.
If the mob is green and is fleeing at > 20% health it will often charge
if you sit and flee if you stand.  Some mobs, like willowisps, will
flee indefinitely unless you sit, in which case they will behave as in
the first example.  There are other variations, I think, but I've never
deliberately studied it because of the aforementioned warping problem
Once long ago in Oasis 8 blue to red con Orcs come charging at Kaev
out of nowhere and turned him into street pizza in seconds, from that
I learned never to willingly allow a mob to warp away, and to zone or
camp to clear agro immediately if it happens, heh.  Even so, there've
been enough occasions hunting solo that low health, low mana, or adds
have prevented me from keeping things under strict control, so I've
seen this sort of thing a lot, I just didn't rely on it as part of my
kill strategy due to bad experiences with warping mobs like the one I
mentioned.
