I can't agree with that.  I used to live in the UK, but now I live in
Maryland, and in our 'everyday' car, we use about $25 of gas a week.  In the
UK, I used to drive less miles (about 100 miles less) and used between 30-35
GBP (or about $50), so effectively I was spending twice as much as I am now.

There are a couple of things to take into consideration though, when
comparing.  In the UK, a gallon is 4.5 litres, yet a US Gallon is only 4
liters.

Also most cars in the US seem to be automatic transmission, which lowers the
fuel consumption considerably.
