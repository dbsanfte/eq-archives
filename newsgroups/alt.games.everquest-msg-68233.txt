I don't have all the options turned on yet, since I installed my SoL
yesterday on a machine running 1.1 AMD Athlon, 128MB Memory. It sucked. I
couldn't even get my character to move. It was like trying to run through a
sea of molasses, plus I got a lot of flickering lights. I installed another
128 today and tried it out awhile ago. Works great. Now I'm gonna go turn
the other options on and see what happens.
