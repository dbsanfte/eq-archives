I agree.  It would be silly to remove all interesting choices from
player control.  And no choice is interesting if it has no negative
ramifications.  So, you can xp a little slower (vs. time played) in
order to keep your skills up, or you can neglect your skills in order
to maximize your rate of xp gain.  The game loses interest fast if
there are no choices more meaningful than the color of your gear, and
I see no strong argument for eliminating this particular choice from
the game.
