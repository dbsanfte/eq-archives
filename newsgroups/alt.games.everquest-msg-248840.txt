Yes, ISDN tariffs in Tennessee are far lower than the rest of 
Bell$outh land. Tennessee's PUC actually looked out for their
constituents when the tariffs were set, and demanded they be
reasonable. I read that one of Tennessee's commissioners at
the time was an ISDN user. The other states' PUCs apparently 
rolled over and let Bell have their way.

A lightning stroke anywhere close, I'm talking several miles, has a 
good chance of breaking my connection. I guess if my router were doing
dial-on-demand it would bring it back up fast enough to avoid linkdeath
in EQ. But, since I work for my ISP also and ISDN here isn't flat rate,
the NAS at the office calls my router instead. It takes about a minute
for it to notice my link is down, long enough to knock me out of EQ.

I've had several Netgear routers blow up, not always due to lightning.
One failed on a perfectly clear day. Another literally blew up with
a firecracker-like BANG and puff of foul smelling smoke when the line
was not even attached. The office loaned me a Cisco 800 box which has
worked for years now without fail.
