It's all relative.  For you or for the original poster, killing these mobs
may be easy, but for my 36 wizzie, who bought it for a 17 warrior, cash is
far and away the shortest route to one of these swords.  But if they are
that easy to get, I expect their price will plunge quickly (dragging down
the price of lesser weapons in the process).  Once that process has played
itself out a bit, my warrior will get one for his other hand.  As the
original poster said, these are *decent* stats, but decent for someone who
can survive and even thrive in the zone where they drop translates into
*fantastic* for someone who /cons sarnak recruits as solid red.
