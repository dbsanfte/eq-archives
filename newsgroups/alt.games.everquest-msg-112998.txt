They never changed it.

Rogues have ALWAYS been the only class that could hide
and sneak at the same time, AND then keep hiding while
sneaking around.

The second you move 1 pixel during a hide with any other
class, hide breaks.

Rogue invis also works on both undead and "regular" mobs
at the same time.  This is ALSO a rogue-only perk to their
sneak/hide ability.
