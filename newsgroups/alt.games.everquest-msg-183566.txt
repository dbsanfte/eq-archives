Who said simply not having the components is the reason for letting
them go un-symboled (I don't say "unbuffed", because they're given all
the other buffs)? Clerics do tend to carry the dots, yes, but they
shouldn't be *expected* to. It's common courtesy not to impose on
someone financially by expecting that you're entitled to have them to
front money for you. I don't think tanks have the right to expect
clerics to make that investment...

The symbols are usually nothing more than spare padding and can be
done quite well without in a lot of situations. Probably most. You
want padding so you can compensate by having bigger numbers for HP,
then you pony up the dots.
