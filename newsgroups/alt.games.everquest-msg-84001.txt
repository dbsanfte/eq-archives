Science is the study of why things work. Most of the greatest strides in
technology are developed from a discovery someone made while trying to
figure out why something happened the way it did. Almost all directed
research is fruitless, trying to figure out how to cure cancer isnt going to
cut it, some pencil necked geeks somewhere studying the biology of turtles
will probably find the cure for it .

Of course science and the resulting technology is why we live better today
than any culture has ever lived before. You had best learn to love the geek
who wants to know why the toast always falls on the butter side because
people like him are the reason you are not chasing dinner with a stone club.

We know very little about how our world works but that small knowledge is by
far the most valuable thing we own. (carl sagan)

Reasonable men adapt themselves to their enviroment , unreasonable men
attempt to adapt their enviroment to them. Therfore all progress is made by
unreasonable men.
