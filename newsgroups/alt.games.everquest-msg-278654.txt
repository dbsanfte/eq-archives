Well, all I can say is that the people dying in Nek must have been either 
stupid, or very low level, or extremely unlucky.  I play a Mystic, I do 
not have any type of invisibility, I do have SoW, but then, anyone can 
buy Wolf totems that give them even faster run speed, and everyone has 
sprint available.  I first explored Nektulos in my high teens, then made 
my first attempt at the JBoots run there in my mid 20s.  A huge number of 
the mobs in Nek were still quite red to me at that time.  The trick is 
don't stop, just keep running, and use sprint when you need to.

Well, aside from the instanced zones at various levels, and the various 
noninstanced dungeons, just counting the wide open areas, at very low 
levels, you have a fair number of choices, then it's 
Commonlands/Antonica, then Nektulos/Thundering Steppes, then Enchanted 
Lands/Zek, then Feerot/Everfrost, not sure after that, as that is as far 
as I have managed to get.  However, in addition to those easy, wide open 
zones, there are both instanced zones, and dungeons at various levels 
too.

And I stand by what I said, you don't get killed a lot when exploring in 
EQ2, unless you are seriously clueless, or seriously unlucky.

I can't speak for WoW, never played it.  Soloing is trivial in EQ2 at all 
levels of the game for all classes.  Exploring, I think I've gone over 
that already.  It is true that the higher end zones are level limited in 
EQ2, so you will have to achieve certain levels in order to explore them.

The game is essentially the same from Freeport or Qeynos as regards 
exploring and soloing.

There are a couple of zones in the Kunark era that required getting keys, 
not sure if either of them was a level limited quest off hand.

In EQ1, you could explore more than EQ2 at any level, but death had much 
more serious consequences.  As far as soloing, only certain classes solo 
well in EQ1, and some can barely solo at all.

I have my issues with EQ2, and with EQ1, in fact I did quite EQ2, but, in 
the end I decided that the friends I had made there were enough fun to 
play with that I would stick around, despite all of SoEs efforts to drive 
me away.
