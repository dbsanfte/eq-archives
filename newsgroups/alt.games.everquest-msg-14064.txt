None, I know of no EQ style game, ie MMORPG, that requires manual skill to
play, PVP as advancement is great idea but what about all the other people
that have already advanced? The reason that Verant made EQ none PvP without
consent was because of the complaints made about UO. Now imagine, you, at
5th level, give exp to that group of 4th levels over there, hmmm...or that
8th level player that has just con'd you...you really want to be the Mob?

The problem with using "skill" in combat is that your internet connection
will sway the outcome. I don't agree, as been said here, that Ping is
everything in the case of Quake style games and I can speak with authority
on this but Quake servers only hold about 20 players max (and league matches
half that) a zone in EQ can hold be between 40 and 160 players at busy times
(and depending on zone) the lowest ping I have so far heard of in EQ is 80,
I get 180 - 210 on ISDN now the way around this is to have more of the
combat done client side but then opens itself up to abuse/cheating (as can
be done in AC, apparently)

I'd be interested to try any game that fitted the criteria you have
suggested but I don't think one exists and I can't really see how one would
ever work.
