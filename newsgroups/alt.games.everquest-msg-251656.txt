I have a 13th level ranger and it's been a pain trying to decide whether to
reroll and get the charm and lose the time i spent trying to max out his
skills in archery etc or stay as i am and hope they make charms more
available. Most people just tell me to level to 60 and join a raiding guild
to get the planar charm. It seems like that slot is way under used on every
server except FV. I really wasn't happy with an uber charm being given out
to newbies only. At the very least, they should have sold it in PoK, like
they sell horses. (eg buy token, hand in token, get no drop)
