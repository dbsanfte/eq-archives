I beta'd DAOC. I prefer EQ (duh) - I'm still here.

DAOC is graphically gorgeous. Running through the hills of Avalon, with the
whip-poor-will chirping and crickets is no where near as annoying as that
damn bird in FV. The flowers sway in the breeze, and man, I could just sit
in one spot and make daisy chains.

But the UI looks very much like the new UI, only not customizeable. The new
fonts and style is identical for name tags. So I feel like EQ ripped DAOC
off in a terrible way by doing that.

What I don't like about DAOC are the sound effects while killing mobs. Too
much like Mortal Kombat for my taste.

DAOC has code that prevents camping. The longer a mob lives, the more XP it
gives you. The more of a certain mob and location you hunt, the less XP it
gives you. I'm too used to camping- watching three or more static spawns and
whacking it as soon as it appears, resting between fights. I can schedule
potty and drink refil breaks accordingly.

DAOC has a lovely code to encourage folks to group together for quests. If
everyone in the group has been given a quest, when you kill the ONE mob that
drops your quest part, EVERYONE gets the part. In EQ, it's wait in line, and
take your turn. One kill per part. I can imagine what would happen to ST
keys if the DAOC code for that was put in! (Now how to we manage so that X
group gets the kill?)

Tradeskills are a little different in DAOC. The economy is based on items
that are expected to decay, and must be of level appropriate. In EQ, a level
one can equip anything, and use it. In DAOC, if it's not level approppriate,
it will break, or have no effect on the mob. It is also possible to make a
profit and do very well starting at a low level. EQ doesn't really have that
option, and was not originially planned for tradeskills.

I do not like the new UI because I don't want to play DAOC. I want to play
EQ. And EQ2 is turning more and more into DAOC, and I do not like it.

I can't explain why I love EQ more than DAOC. It's comfy, and all my friends
are here, are probably my best reasons.

Oh, and DAOC has Realm vs. Realm at higher levels. This means at the end
game you WILL be PvP. Cringe. The thing I hate most about PVP is knowing how
I'd feel if someone killed me. And I don't want anyone to feel like that.
Not by my hand. Yes you *can* reach the high levels in DAOC without it. But
allegedly it's not as much "fun".

There's also the nice thing in DAOC where you die and still have all yer
stuff. But the penalty is loss of constitution. You must pray at your tomb,
or pay to have it restored. In EQ, you find your corpse, loot your stuff,
and maybe get a resurection to get XP back (after level 10).

And DAOC won't let you run to zonelines for safety, you have to run to
guards at set spots. And if you drop something in DAOC, it has yer name on
it, and only you can get that- even yer alt cannot lift it. And DAOC has no
bank. you carry everything on you at once. Does change yer coin over
automatically and there's no encumberance. But that's not very realistic.
