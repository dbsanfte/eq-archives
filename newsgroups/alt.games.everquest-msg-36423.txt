     I'm shocked that no one has made reference to the fact that
according to casters realm, with the Luclin expansion Shaman get
"Grow".  Shocked, I say.

  Hmmm...I do have lag on Drinal once in a while, but I had assumed
that I would no matter what server I was on.  It is not bad, and 
I'm only gone linkdead a total of perhaps 4 times.  I am on a 
cable modem, though, so I don't know if that is exceptionally bad
or exceptionally good.
