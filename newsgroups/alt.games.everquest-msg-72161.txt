More likely it's a banner or a popup doing this. Often times, a web
host will sorta "subscribe" to a "package" when it comes to those.
They don't necissarily know what all of them are for. They might not
even be aware that Gator's popup/banner attempts to install the
software automaticly...

Just saying 'cause I got nothing from Gator when I went to the site...
