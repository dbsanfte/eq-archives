Well it is certainly a narrow gauge arguement, but he's saying given a
choice between a 54 cleric and a 54 druid, you'd pick the druid.

Given a free choice of any healer whatsoever, you'd probably
want a 60 shaman who has torpor, especially if the new CHeal
goes thru.  I mean, up till now thats been the best choice for
an exp group, and I don't see where beefing up cleric damage
output is going to come close to compensating for slow
plus haste plus decent heals and far better mana flow.
