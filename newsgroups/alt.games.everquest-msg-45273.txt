    I think what he's saying is that ALL 55-60 spells are in fairly short
supply, and Wake isn't more rare than, say, Chill Bones is for a
necromancer. What might make it seem rarer is the demand for the spell -
there's a ton of druids out there, and from what has been said here they all
want Wake. I contrast that with my class, cleric - at level 60 I have Stun
Command, Mark of Karn, Naltron's Mark, Aegolism as the only drop-only spells
in my spellbook, and truthfully that's all I'll ever really need.

    When I see druids auctioning for spells, it's always Blizzard and Girdle
of Karana they want.
