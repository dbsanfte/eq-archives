Yes, I meant that the game forces you to assume a role that in most
sustaining cultures would be considered evil -- not that the Devil wrote the
game...

I want more intelligent, cunning, and nasty foes. I want to make my money
collecting big rewards for a few spectacular kills, not by looting the
pockets of dumb, tactically deprived creatures we have outnumbered six to
one.....

I want to make money selling pots and bows and bear steaks...real money...

The best, most heart pounding fun I have had in everquest was when Verant
was experimenting with real player monsters. I spent an absolutely thrilling
time chasing a player orc centurion who kept sneaking into the newb's zone
at Kelethin, wacking some young folks, then running like hell back to the
north camp, where he/she would hide among the dumb orcs, just standing and
waiting. It was truly what I expected EQ to be when I started....
