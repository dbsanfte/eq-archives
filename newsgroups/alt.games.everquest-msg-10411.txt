Allright... for starters, let's just concentrate on your druid, as
he's the highest level, and the natrual moneymaker with Sow and ports.

For the meanwhile, just concentrate on levelling.  once you get up to
20, find you a nice uncamped bandit camp somewhere in the Karanas, and
set up shop.  They carry bronze weapons, which sell for a couple plat
to vendors, as well as drop Bandit Sashes, which you can turn into the
South Qeynos paladin guild for yet more bronze weapons, as well as a
good bit of cash, exp, and faction.  The exp here will be pretty slow,
as the only way you'll be getting any is when you turn the shashes in,
but the money is hard to beat for the level.  A good night's work can
yeild you upwards of 50 plat, when you get your technique down pat.

Once you get bored with that, and have a few more levels under your
belt, it's time to start hitting the low-mid level dungeons, Sol A,
Cazic-thule, Mistmoore, Dalnir's...  Not only are there fine steel
weapons in abundance, but you stand a pretty good chance on winning
rolls for decent loot which you can sell for more plat.  You just have
to be willing to accept the fact that you'll need to be grouped in
order to have any sucess at all in dungeon camps... But honestly, the
exp and money will be better.  Not only are you safer in groups, but
you can kill more stuff easier, and most dungeons provide a pretty
nice exp bonus per kill.  And groups are allways looking for quality
healers.
