Yup!  Note that this is true for dots, _NOT_ debuffs.  Casting two debuffs on
a mob won't have an additive effect, and in many cases won't even both stick
on the mob.

For classes that have dot+debuff spells, this can reduce the value of dot
stacking - the debuff portion not stacking may prevent the dot portion from
stacking either.

Not sure.  It's possible that the darkness line can only be on from one necro.
There are enough other lines that are pure dots for necros that you'll do
fine, though.  Should be something to see :)
