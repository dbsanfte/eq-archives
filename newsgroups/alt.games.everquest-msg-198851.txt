I probably shouldn't get involved, but he's right. You are a twit.

 I've only been reading this group for a few weeks now, and I've
noticed that you are unecc. rude with as many posters as you are with
this one, simply because he has a different opinion than you. 

He didn't insult you, man. The closest he came was stating, in
general, that not having KEI was insane. Please take noticed that it
was not directed at you, but just a blanket statement. 

Your arguements were weak and inconclusive. When pressed for
supporting statements, you went for personal insults. 

You ARE a moron. 

Learn to deal with your issues, then more people will listen to your
ideas rather than focusing on your behavior. And you do want people to
listen obviously...its why you post...unless you just like to read
your own blatherings. 

However, you've been enough of a jerk to warrant a *plonk* from this
newbie.
