I don't see them as that diferent.  For some people, the fact that
they are "just playing a game" is constantly in their mind, and more
power to them.  Others, however, like to become more immersed in the
environment, granting to NPC's many of the same rights and the same
respect we would (and must) grant to others in real life.

This one I won't get into; would get much too messy.  But I think a
definition of evil could easily be contrived which would include jerks
quite handily.  I've never heard that eating babies is a prerequisite
for evil, but excessive self-involvement to the detriment of others
might be getting close to a definition of the word.  Yes, deliberately
cheating others is evil in my book, although obviously not the worst
form of it.

I disagree.

Before people realized that killing treants was a mistake if you
wanted to use the druid rings (this is going back a ways), treants
used to be very popular targets.  Druids would kill them too.  Now,
what possible roleplaying reason could a druid have for killing
treants?  Oh, you could probably make one up if you stretched a bit,
but was this *why* those druids were killing treants?  I submit not.
They were there because the treants were easy to kill and dropped good
loot.  The players didn't give a damn that as druids they were
supposed to venerate treants.  This says quite a bit about the player,
I think.  At the very least that he pays no attention whatsoever to
the underlying fiction of the game.

A wood elf who worships Tunare goes on a PoG raid.  He only scouts,
doesn't kill anything.  The game will not punish him for this.  You
see nothing wrong with this?  I certainly do -- he is assisting others
to kill the creatures of Tunare and perhaps even Tunare herself, the
very god he supposedly worships.  He is almost certainly doing it to
have a chance at phat lewtz.  

It is difficult to imagine a context where this is "roleplaying."  The
person is being a loot-whore in the game and a loot-whore in real
life.  Perhaps not the worst form of evil, but a jerk certainly.

But again, this argument really boils down to a difference of opinion
between those who see EQ as just a game -- i.e., anything the game
doesn't punish me for is allowable, since I am playing by the rules --
and those who see it as living a novel or some such, where even if
something is not specifically disallowed you might still not want to
do it.
