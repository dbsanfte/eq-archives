The post titled "SOW? Do I look like a Druid", really hit home for me. Now
you guys know how Druids feel. Ever wonder why so many use Anon or Roleplay?
Particularly in Freeport and the Commons areas. Greater Faydark is just as
bad.

I am a Wood Elf Druid and I can SOW, and I have made the mistake of doing it
in a crowded areas. I can't do anything else after that. Tunare help me if I
Bind someone in open view of others. It's like making a bad pull. People
come out of the woodwork mobbing you. Begging for everything from buffs to
money.

One thing that I will do is SOW, Buff and Bind someone that recognizes me
for what I am. Especially if they use /tell. I respect that they at least
know enough to recognize a Druid by sight. I suppose that's why I like the
higher level areas now days. Solitude and no oppressive hordes.

Now I don't mind helping people out, but where do you draw the line?
