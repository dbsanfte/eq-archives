Seconded and thirded... no sane guild should expect to retain its clerics
if it expects them to cover raid component costs out of their own pocket.
Ditto for the other component-using classes I imagine.

Clerics are hardly a cash-raising class in the first place. Expecting them
to absorb the costs of a raid is an invitation to a /removeguild. While
a guild could theoretically get by without any clerics, I don't imagine
it would be easy.

When I first joined my guild, components *weren't* being covered by the
guild. We don't raid much, so I put up with it, but I mentioned it in
our guild forums and these days I get handed stacks of dots even *outside*
of raids, which is very nice. It's the sort of overreaction I can
definitely live with...
