Possibly, as Kunark is old news now...I would find this kind of funny as
Tuesday I helped a friend get his HS key (don't actually  have one for
myself) but the keys not being required would open up the zones more.
I hear HS is very quiet zone, may have to take a look this weekend and see
if I can get in...although if it's a bug then losing a corpse in there and
having the risk of it being "fixed" could cause much amusement :ï¿½/
