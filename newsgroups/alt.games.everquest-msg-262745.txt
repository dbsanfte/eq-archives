For summoned pets, you are correct.

It didn't always work this way for summoned pets.  It used to be that you
had to outdamage the pet to get full experience.  Otherwise, you got 50%.

I know charmed pets can take a percentage of xp based on how much damage
they do, but I'm not overly familiar with charmed pets and xp.
