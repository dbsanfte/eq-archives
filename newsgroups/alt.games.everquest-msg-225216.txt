Oh, thanks. In that case, the problem was the opposite... I didn't know 
the correct pronunciation of "sow" (the porcine kind), thinking it would 
be the same as "sow" (the agricultural kind).

That I didn't know either... which is weird, as I've always 
instinctively pronounced the name "Bowman" the correct way.

On the other hand, you can learn the whole of English grammar in a long 
afternoon, so it does have advantages.

Are you positive? Mandarin has the most native speakers, and English is 
the most widely learnt second language. Perhaps Spanish has a larger 
combined figure?

At any rate, Spanish is very easy to pick up and take to a serviceable 
level, but as most Latin languages is quite difficult to master, for 
example because of the randomly gendered nouns, the surfeit of verb 
tenses and inherent bizarreness like the usage of the "Ser" and "Estar" 
verbs (two different flavours of "To Be").

English is the opposite, it has an almost vertical learning curve, but 
after you get over it, there's not that much left... although I still 
find myself making silly mistakes on things that don't follow logical 
rules, like where to use "in", "on" or "at".
