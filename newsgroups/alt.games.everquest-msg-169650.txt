Has any party ever used that slogan
"Jesus woulda voted for us"

Seems quite catchy.

I believe that the application of modern terms
such as 'liberal' and 'conservative' to Jesus to
be meaningless.

As has happened throughout history, either (or
any) side is capable of interpreting the
Scriptures as support for their own ends.

The parable of the talents can be seen (by me, at
least) as an endorsement of capitalism, just as
Engels drew parallels between early Christianity
and Communism.

In the USA today, I believe either side, liberal
or conservative, could and would, find enough
evidence to give Him a lethal injection, His
silence being a far better option to politicians
(and the clergy), than the alternative.
