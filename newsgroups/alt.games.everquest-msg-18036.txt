Why crack it? All you have to do is transmit the same sequence of zeroes and
ones that you watched them transmit.

Or the boneheaded player to have a cable modem. Or be playing over their

================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."

                   From "Travels with Charlie"
