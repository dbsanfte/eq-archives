The root-rot technique is actually fairly reliable. Not as exciting as
DD kiting, but it is actually more time-efficient. Think about it,
what are you doing while that DOT is eating away at the mob?
Meditating? No? Why not? Sit your butt down and stare at the book. It
makes for less downtime between the fights, and mana saved for same
damage...
