I think it's a case of the reader's background, personally. I looked at
it and I *still* can't see anything other than "one toke".  But then
again I smoked a lot of pot when I was a young man. (Yes, yes, I know...
you can all tell.)

But I can also see how somebody growing up in a convent or something,
never exposed to any "street lingo" might not make the connection.

This leads us to the following question: Do we think the designers at
Verant Interactive are likely to be closer to the "convent" types, or
the "drug induced hallucination" type?

I'd best not insert my own guess, for fear of prejudicing the poll.
