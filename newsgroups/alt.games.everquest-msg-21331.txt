Well, to be fair, you have to admit that when you are slashing or bashing the poor beastie to
it's grave, you are bound to ruin a few eyes/ears/wings/etc.  Although, you would think that the
beastie should have a certain amount of body parts, losing them depending on your weapons
skills.
Don't anyone say that it's uncodable, as there is already at least 1 Quest that if you use
Slashing weapons, you will never, EVER get the body part that you need from the critter.  Some
sort of damage-coding related to weapon-types is already in place.  Although, I'll admit, weapon
skill-levels are certainly another story.

It's those bats that have 3 and even 4 wings that crack me up!  In RL, if I ever saw a 4-winged
bat on my mountain at dusk, I'd be a rich man.
