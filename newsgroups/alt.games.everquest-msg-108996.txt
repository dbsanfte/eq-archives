I'm guessing the most likely scenario is that there is no "wife"
involved at all. He's pissed off at this guy for whatever lame little
teenager reason and is now trying to cause trouble for him.

If there somehow *is* a wife involved, I'm guessing the OP is somebody
who lost his woman to this other guy and he's looking for some sort of
pathetic type of revenge.
