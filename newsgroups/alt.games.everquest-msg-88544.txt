I'm inclined to think c) myself, since I've seen some strange numbers
when conning corpses.  Of course, the thing to do is duel, note the
res time on the conned corpse, and then stick around for 40 minutes to
see if you can ACTUALLY res it.

I too am 99.9% certain that in Perma I could not res a person who had
died (from a duel) within the last half hour tops.
