Verant just gave bind to everyone with the addition of Soulbinders.

Pure casting classes still retain the "Class Defining" ability of
binding anywhere (with a few noted exceptions), so they lose nothing.

Non-Binding classes gain nothing, because Soulbinders are only located
in major cities where they have always been able to bind in the past.
(In essence they gain time and convenience, while saving some pp)

Casters that made it a policy to "bind for free" are no longer saddled
with the burden and can spend more time doing what they want.

The only thing "lost" is the ability to blackmail non-binding classes
by parking yourself at a major city and asking for donations for the
service. My guess is that these are the only people complaining about
the change.

Cheers
