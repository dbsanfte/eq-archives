hehe....now that i have your attention, a friend of mine was listening
to Art Bell one night and told me that the verse listed in the Bible
was a gross misinterpretation. Some guest on his show was splaining
it. I looked it up and heres what I found on the net.


Thou Shalt Not Suffer A Witch To Live

What about that infamous mistranslation of Ex. 22:18 in the King James
Version of the Bible; "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."
As to why that's a mistranslation, here's the evidence supporting this
claim:

In the KJV, the translation of Ex. 22:18 is "Thou Shalt not suffer a
Witch to live. The NIV, (a contextual translation), has it as "Thou
shalt not suffer a sorcerer to live."

In the Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, it claims the
word "witch" in Hebrew as " 3784 kashaph, a prim. root; prop. to
whisper a spell, i.e. to enchant or practice magic:--sorcerer, (use)
witch (-craft)."

However, in the Webster's New World Hebrew Dictionary, the term
"kashaph", can be broken into two parts: a root word, "kash", meaning,
"straw, herb, reed", and "hapaleh", or "casting, bringing down,
using."

Combined, these words translate into "using/casting
herbs/straws/reeds" - one who uses herbs.

So a better translation is "one who uses/has knowledge of herbs". 

Hebrew is a contextual language. Words can have a positive or negative
meaning based upon context.

Kashaph is not the Hebrew term for witch. The Hebrew term for
witchcraft is "keeshoof", meaning sorcery or magic. "Mekhash" means
"to bewitch", and the term for a female who practices magic is
"mekhashah", whereas the term for a male is "mekhashef", (the "ah" and
"ef" suffix denoting gender.)

Note that none of these terms has a similar root to "kashaph".
Therefore, the question is, why did a unrelated term like "kashaph"
get mistakenly translated into "witch" ?? Easy, terms that denote
"knowledge of herbs" have tended to get translated as "witchcraft" in
theological writings for nearly 2000 years.

Now we get into the "to live" or "live" part. Strong's lists that word
in Ex. 22:18 as 02421 chayah {khaw-yaw'} 1) to live, have life, remain
alive, sustain life, live prosperously, live for ever, be quickened,
be alive, be restored to life or health

Again, let's look at the Webster's New World. 

Since, "ch" does get changed into a "k" in Hebrew, we'll look up the
word "khay", or "khayah". Webster's gives the definition as: "living,
alive, living among, dwelling, being alive, being full of life."

According to the Hebrew, as backed up by a Hebrew dictionary, the
phrase cited, Ex. 22:18, uses a negative context to refer to "one who
uses herbs, dwelling/living among you" - i.e. you shall not allow
someone who uses herbs in a negative manner, (poisoner), to dwell
among you. Which is utterly unrelated to what the KJV says. If the
original texts *meant* "witch" or "witchcraft", ("mekhashah" and
"keeshoof"), then *why* did it NOT use the Hebrew terms for "witch" or
"witchcraft" ?? Instead, the terms it used, being unrelated to "witch"
or "witchcraft", were then *mistakenly* translated as "witch" and
"witchcraft".
