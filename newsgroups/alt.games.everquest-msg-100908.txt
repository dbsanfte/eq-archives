The question begs to be asked, "What state do you live in?"  I live in
California because my husband is in the Navy and stationed in San Diego.
You obviously know *nothing* about the rent situation in our area of the
country or you would not have made such a comment.  FYI, housing is at a
premium here, we pay $1200 a month for a 3 bedroom apartment.  This is up
from the $900 we originally paid less than 2 years ago when we moved here.
Move, you say?  Oh! Well, I  *would* move if anything in our budget range
was available.  It is extremely difficult to find affordable housing here
(especially for those with families), so once you are in a place you tend to
stay there and just be thankful you have a place you can pay for to stay in.
And unless you know anything about the waiting lists for military housing(2
year minimum for *ALL* military housing here), don't even suggest it.
     Regarding the power situation in California, many people in the San
Diego are not *native* Californians.  A lot of us do not vote here, nor pay
state taxes (we pay them to our home states).  We are merely here for a
while until our assignment is up and we move elsewhere--but while we are
here, we are paying for to quote you--"an incompetent populace electing the
same type
 of leaders."  It doesn't make the fucking electric bill any less.  And
unless you can give me your credentials that make you *more* than an
armchair political scientist, your blather is nothing more than an opinion.
Try living it before you open your mouth.
