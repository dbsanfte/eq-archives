I had tried a number of servers. Had about 25 alts at one time. I've
played for a year now. One toon at 14th, several at 11-12, the rest
below 5th.

I started out on Stromm, always lots of new folks there. When I
started a toon on other servers, almost always the toons in glooming
deep mines were twinked. Xegony pok had about 200 toons last
weekend, around the same number as Stromm pok on a busy night.

I would hope that if they are increasing the number of spells
available, the number of casting slots will go up from 8.
