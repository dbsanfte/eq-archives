Well, in one regard you certainly win, in that after reading that load
of tripe, I will join with the mass of other who by now have given up
trying to have a rational discussion with you on this topic and have
doubtless concluded that you are:
a) incapable of accepting any opinion other than your own
b) and egomaniac beyond the dreams of most, since the *only* things you
put forth as "facts" in your alleged rebuttals are opinions that you
have unilaterally declared to be "facts". Examples:
> Sorry, the value of the spellbook is GROSSLY outweighed by its
> irritation level.
(opinion, stated as fact)
> ...and because your rite of passage baloney has already been

(proclamation that "rites of passage" have no value because Ben doesn't
believe in them.)

([The above regarding hell levels] here again, you claim that *you* have
determined that hell levels don't affect the difficulty of the game as a
whole, even though it was earlier supported that people sometimes quit
over the hell levels because they are so frustrating. Again, Ben's
opinion stated as fact, but opposing opinions are "baloney that has been
cut apart and discarded" for not matching up with Ben's "facts".)

c) incapable of reading what's actually read and responding to it,
instead of responding to something that you wish had been said.
d) some sort of parrot, since you keep repeating the same things over
and over that does nothing to answer the questions put to you. 

The only remaining bit is your last snippet of self-ego-inflating and
insulting comments on individual characters. (Is your real name Ed? Ed
Hominem?)

For what it's worth, (likely nothing given your limited reading
comprehension skills) the warrior is the twink. He is the second to last
character created out of that group. (Only the necro is younger in
birthdate, and yes, was twinked a fair bit.) and all the others got
where they were on what they could gain/achieve in-game under all the
old rules, thank you very much. And twinking doesn't affect whether or
not you saw the spell book. No amount of plat could buy your way out of
that. Nor would any amount of plat change the fact that the hell levels
would take longer in relative proportion to complete than the others, no
matter how fast your twink earns xp. Your faint, child-like cries of
"jealous!" do little to make you appear more than a teenager, and your
failure to respond to the actual answers given to your "questions" makes
you a poor debate partner.

Best of luck.
