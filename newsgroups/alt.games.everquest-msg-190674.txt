I'm not sure this will work.  I've beaten down a mob as a newbie and died 
and respawned a few feet away from it, killed it the rest of the way and 
didn't get the XP.  Your way may still work, who knows.

Still not exactly efficient with all that zoning, but possibly the best 
idea I've seen for using a pally to plvl so far.
