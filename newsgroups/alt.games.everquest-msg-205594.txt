To be honest I don't know any...I know Martin *can* 4 "box" but I believe he
normally limits himself to 3.
I have yet to meet another 3 boxer on Bristlebane...I know of plenty that
can and do 2box but not seen anyone 3...They probably are there, somewhere.

Only time I complain is when "you" are out of position, ie.  not out of
aggro range of new spawns or of rooted mobs.

Yep I normally do this but it is rare that I'll get aggro...some mobs aggro
worse than others...Goranga's, I have noticed, take real offense to being
slowed so I won't sit for a while after shiftless.

Unless I can get an Evac off, yep, this is the price of 3 boxing...This is
why I always pull, I know what I can handle.

> 4)Downtime is exceedingly longer

Not sure I'd agree with that, pulls will definitely be slower, no way can a
multi-boxer play like 3 ppl.
No matter how often ppl tell you seem to, you don't. When it comes to crunch
time one mistake and that's it.

Yes, only one person to speak to, doesn't provide too much in the way of
conversation, on top of that they have 3 screens to monitor and are normally
too busy to talk.

Well then you met a Moron... I can imagine Multi-Boxers will often be
missing drop spells and the like (I am) but bought ones....unforgivable
really.

Again, similar to point 6, My Druid and 'chanter have "ok" equipment but it
doesn't match my Warriors and isn't a patch on what someones main Druid or
'chanter would be like.

I imagine Martin, Mr DPS himself, would argue that point...I'm not sure I
understood it, to be honest.

Due to keyboards being poorly placed I'd imagine. Don't have that

Too true....Stairs and ledges are dangerous, as are tight passages (ooh er)

Explain...his cleric was using a some sort of text reading macro to heal?

That made little sense, must be your anger coming through.

TBH, unless you know the person, don't group with multi-boxers.
I do it so I can play whenever I want and not have to rely on anyone else. I
rarely group while doing it and if I do I make sure the group knows the
situation and accepts that I will not be as effective as 3 ppl. I am also
the first to grab a player that can replace one of my bots..The amount of
times I have bot'd with strangers in the group I can count on one hand and
still have enough fingers left to make obscene gestures with...
I don't enjoy botting with others, you are on constant edge all the time,
can't relax or enjoy anyones company. I am more likely to do it if power
levelling...If I am in a zone and a similarly levelled character is LFG I
will let him join (Then I say my goodbyes when he starts telling me that I
should pull faster) on one occasion actually ended forming a group that,
imo, should have done pretty well (I was logging) without me.

As for playing Healer and Warrior doesn't make to many odds, TBH, MT and
Healer is the best roles for multi-box but I kind of understand what you
mean, it's a nice buzz when a group is all doing their jobs...Just as a
Warrior what you can do in a crisis is limited to switching targets and
mashing a taunt key, oh and sitting down.

Please explain "not watching and healing yourself" because my warrior can't
do that...shit, if he could I wouldn't need the Druid :ï¿½)

Are you inviting "botters" into groups, unknowingly or are you joining them
unknowingly? If so I can see your point and why you would be angry...If you
are aware of that and you let them in (or join them) then you have to expect
this, maybe not that lack of spells but definitely the lack of effectiveness
incomparison to 3 or 4 players.

As I said before, avoid them unless you know them and can accept the
limitations of the "group."
