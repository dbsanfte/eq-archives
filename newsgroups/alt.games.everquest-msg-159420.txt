Aye I had this problem not too long ago and almost started crying when I
discovered the ledges were just too high to get out.  Then I remembered
that my Barbarian was awesome at swimming (thank you Halas!)  If you are a
fast enough swimmer, swim down a little bit, then directly at the wall,
once you are parallel to the wall, swim straight up, when you hit the
surface you will pop out and hopefully onto dry land.  Heh now whenever I
go there I do this just for fun :)
