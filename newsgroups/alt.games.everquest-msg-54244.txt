Have you ever checked the archieves and seen the living Hell he went
throught learning how to post X-No-Archieve: yes?  He continues to do it,
because, he thinks it's hard to do.  Who wants to tell him that Google isn't
the only Usenet archieving service on the planet and that they all don't
obey X-No-Archieve.

Not that it matters in the least, except to bizbee.

Some people need to put others down to feel better about themselves.
