Heh, yeah.  While it does appear that the Monk nerf was somewhat
overkill, before it happened you couldn't swing a Halfling Druid
without hitting 3 or 4 Monk twinks (my apologies to whoever I stole
that from).  Monk twinks were like lemmings, and when the nerf-bat
knocked one of 'em off the cliff all the rest followed, hardly see
any Monks that aren't old-timers or new players anymore.
