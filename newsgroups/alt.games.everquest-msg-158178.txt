I'd say porting is more than a convenience, since the lack of ports can make
many things undoable, when you take into account real-world constraints.
For example, I'm pretty sure my guild would not be able to raid in Halls of
Testing without ports.  Spires->Nexus->GD->EW->KD->WL->SS->CS->SG->WW->ToV
would be way too time consuming, especially considering the possibility of
getting there and finding that the areas we can do are camped, and then
having to do the reverse run to go find something else to do.  (And don't
forget the inevitable deaths on a run like that when invis falls for someone
in KD right as a KD group brings a nice train by, and that kind of stuff).
Without ports, the setup time for many raids would be long enough that
people would not have enough time to *do* the raid once it starts.

Well, it sounds like in PoP there's another possibility.  Epic Cleric gates
out, and comes back to the zone in (as does everyone else who can gate).
Non-gaters die (gaters can die too if they want to go out in a blaze of
glory).  Wait 15 minutes for the corpses to show up in the graveyard.
Cleric goes wild with res stick.  A death followed by an epic res is barely
noticable, and with everyone sharing raid XP, everyone will probably
actually come out ahead on net XP for the raid, assuming the raid has
managed to at least get a couple kills before things went bad.
