Here's my logic:

When it is just the two of us, or only three when we add Orlun, if I
just toss a celest on him when he's down a bub & half or two bubs, my
mana has regened in time for me to cast another one. If I wait and cast
CHeal, I'm down a bubble of mana, and it doesn't regen in the time it
takes him to need another one. I have less downtime between fights with
celest. Also, if I have Orlun pulling, Jakugg sometimes has trouble
holding the aggro (particularly if our rogue is being properly roguish
and using poisons). If I wait and do CHeals, I've found myself in the
horrible position of not being able to save one of them. I have tossed a
celest on Orlun and went for the CHeal on Jakugg when I can in these
situations, but sometimes it doesn't get off in time, or fizzles.

I realize group mechanics change with larger groups and multi-groups.
But I haven't hunted in them much. Just duos, trios, and the occasional
4 or 5 man team. Lately, when I do get into a group, it tends to be
bigger. And I do expect my methods to adapt.

I tend to use Greater Heal on casters. It's faster, uses less mana, and
usually all they ever need.
