Wrong the same bunch that run the game now released Luclin with a
couple of notable exceptions. Verant always was partly owned by Sony.
The guys who made the game what it was left after Vel was released.
Luclin was a big money move the motivations of which are still subject
to debate. Man you know this stuff...

Ethics and legalities are two different things DT. The tactic is
called Hammering among other things and is considered unethical in any
treatise on the subject Ive ever read. It works in much the same way
as long term interrogations where the subject is repeatedly asked the
same question, eventually capitulation is the only relief given the
subject.  Works really well.

Not unique but there are many who dont. Those are the only ones I will
invest my time in from now on. SoE has just taken this expansion thing
to a new level.

Sure it is, I voted with my feet. Found a better game by a better
company. So guess I did decide after all.

First EQ survives in much the same way, to say there is not a large
number of people mentally addicted to the game is inane. Also there
are large number of people who use the game to relax once in a while.
My comparison stands as that exactly describes drug usage. Legality
withstanding of course. This old "has to make a profit" cliche is
about worn out, heck they were already making a hell of a profit.

Stupid? Not when I use the VERY conservative figure of only half the
accounts upgrading. Your remark was uncalled for and only lends
credence to my position.  Also please point to where I said profit, it
was you who provided the stupidity. You a Democrat btw DT? nm thats
getting dirty, sorry....

Sorry dont agree with ya, a new game is way overdue. Also content
reaches a point where, like everything else, diminishing returns kicks
in. Only so much can be used and cant say its any  better than what
its replaced.

Much as I like arguing with you DT this aint helping anyone so enjoy
your game and good luck.
