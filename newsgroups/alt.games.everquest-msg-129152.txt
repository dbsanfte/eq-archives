Kunark Forest Giants are stunnable, unlike any other giant I've fought
anywhere on Norrath, and so perhaps they can be mesmerized (never seen
an enchanter try).  Mountain Giants, Sand Giants, Hill Giants, Frost
Giants, and (I presume) Storm Giants (never been to Kael) cannot be
stunned or mesmerized.

With a decent group (a healer, a couple tanks, and most anything else
except a wizard too low level to land a nuke) and a competent puller you
can do pretty well at the FM giant fort.  With a random collection of
self-promoted LOIO dick-wavers you probably won't do so well.
