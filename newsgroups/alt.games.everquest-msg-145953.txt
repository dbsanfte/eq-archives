Druids and necros are designed to solo, and probably wont get a group
anyway. This is how verant designed things, and im sure many druids and
necros would love to be in groups, if they could. So what youre saying is
that because verant forces these classes to solo, they should be punished
for being antisocial. Bravo. Let me guess, you dont play a druid or necro?
