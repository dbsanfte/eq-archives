And that team has to be paid (likely with benefits) from a greatly 
reduced number of active subscriptions.

"No, Dear, those pants don't make you look fat." There's a darn good 
chance they told you what you needed to hear.

I think it all boils down to whether they actually felt a legitimate 
*need* to increase the subscription rate, for any reason (including to 
make up for shortfalls on other games). We have no way of knowing if 
that is true or not, so I hardly think it appropriate to assume they 
lied to you. 

Even if they didn't really *need* to raise rates, what were they gonna 
say? "We just want to make more money"? Yeah, that'd go over really 
well.

Not that it matters anyway.
