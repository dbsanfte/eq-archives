I upgraded to dx9 though I'm not sure why.  8.1 ran just fine and I only
have a gf3ti500 card which doesn't even support the dx9 features.  Having
said that, I had no problems installing it and everything seems to be fine
now (much as it was with 8.1).  I forget what drivers I am running, I think
40.82 or something along those lines.

Cheers!
