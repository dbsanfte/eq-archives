<Top Post Fixed>

WTF have you been smoking ? Id be extremly pissed if the ML decided in the
middle of the adventure to nick off with all the loot w/o doing a split. Not
to mention the whole prima dona / "Im not going to win so screw you all Im
leaving now attitude" would get the bastard hunted down and repeatedly
coprse camped on the server I play on.

Tell me, what server do YOU play on so that I can avoid it like the plague,
and thus insure that I have to deal with one less clueless asshole in my
lifetime....
