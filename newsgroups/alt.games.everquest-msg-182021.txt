That card will operate fine with EQ and is used by many thousands (if not
tens of thousands) of players today (we have one running EQ today in our
house). You'll enjoy the game quite a bit more with this card, good luck!
Make sure you use the most recently updated nVidia drivers (not just the
ones that ship with your card in the box), and the most recent version of
DirectX available.
