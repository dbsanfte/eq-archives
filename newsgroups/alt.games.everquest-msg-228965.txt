It seems to me that the solution is to make the person doing the turn in
'flagged'. At that point, they can't get the earlier quest but can always
get the item for the next step if they need it. If multiquesting is a
problem, why not instance the encounter? I understand this is already done
with an iksar monk doing their epic via the shackles? they have to fight
their guildmaster solo?
