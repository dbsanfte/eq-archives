When my mage was 39, I loved the fire pet.  Have you gotten around to doing
the Torch of Alna?  The focused Fire pet is my favorite for soloing because
his self-generated DS is VERY nasty.  Yes, you need to arm him up and heal
him, but mobs just rip themselves up on it.  (At level 49, I still use the
fire pet for solo work.)  Air pet is my favorite for groups; healers love
the stun effect for the reduced damage on the tank.

Heh - I agree with you here. I leave the F off and just call it Lame Arc.

Again, agreed.

Keep torturing the tanks.  This is a 20 point damage shield; with a mob that
quads and hits, it does 80 points a round to the enemy.  By far the most
efficient spell damage you have at this level.

Remember the rings have AC on them.  I hand two to my summoned pet along
with his swords of runes and phantom plate; it can't hurt.  Also recall that
these are instant-cast; keeping one hotkeyed if you're autofollowing a bard
is an excellent idea.

Yes, this one is such crap.

It's been parsed on the Mage's Compendium, and while it doesn't reduce how
often your pet gets hit, it does reduce the damage it takes per hit - which
if you're working with low-hp pets like Fire and Air, makes it worth the
effort.
