LOIO is ok for spell cash, but hardly great.  SK Aviaks is an old
old story, but it works.  The Darters are the best bang for the
buck, better loot than Rooks even tho they're lower level.  SK is
easy to learn, Harmony works, both of my Druids used Aviaks for
Defense skill-ups and as a source of spell cash in late teens and
early twenties.  Not original, not fancy, not exiting, but it works.
Oh, and bring batwings, Lev is very handy when pulling from the big
bird house.  You might manage to die once or twice, then again you
might not.  It's not high risk, but there are mistakes that can be
made and if you are slow to recover you may have a CR or two to do
before you're done.
