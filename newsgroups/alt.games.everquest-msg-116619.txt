Logging in to the Chat server does -not- run your timer down.  This
is the key to dealing with bad Total Wipes, everyone logs out to the
chat servers while porters and clerics set up, and then someone logs out
to the chat server to tell you when to log in.

Of course the -real- key to dealing with TW is to have a high level
necro availble, and an alt logged out next to the zone line with stacks
of stackable coffins.  Its been ages since I saw a TW recovery time
go over 30 minutes.
