Ding ding ding, we have a winner!  Not that you needed me to tell you that.

We do things strictly by merit, and the officers decide who gets what. 
There are no "points" that are spent, but they do take note of who tends to
participate and who doesn't.

The basic idea is "Promise them their gear and they'll stay loyal until the
last one gets it."

So far, it's worked out great, but we have trustworthy officers.
