}I don't run into that problem much, playing a monk and all.

I still can't think of a reason I'd -really- need to know who you were 
assisting.  Or when.  Or on what.  As long as you -are- assisting, or 
people are assisting you, I'm a happy chanter.  So keep the spam down so 
my /tells from fools wanting me to leave Seb and make jewelry for them 
won't scroll off so fast. :)

I'd think you might get more mileage out of an 'Inc %T!' button. :)

I usually only even use my 'mezzing %T' button if I'm replacing a mez some 
dink broke.  Maybe twice a night.
