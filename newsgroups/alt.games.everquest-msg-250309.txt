And in the case of the Firiona Vie server you can't even do that, if rumors
are true. The rumor there is that the guild leader himself of one of the two
time-flagged guilds, is either the same person as, or is somehow sponsoring,
the infamous Shanana, who is always selling in the Bazaar items worth
millions of plats, including Time and GoD gear. The rumor said that Shanana
was also the source of these same items to Yantis. Never found out if these
particular rumors were true, but it was pretty clear that Shanana was
selling a ton of gear that only that guild could have produced. And it
continued on for so long that it would be hard to understand how it could
continue without some form of sponsorship (or at least tolerance) at the
highest levels.
