What do you *do* for tradeskill items in a pickup group?  Roll on every one? 
I'm just curious.  These days *everyone* has an alt that does one tradeskill or
another.
Define:  *NBG*, and how you can enforce it.  Case in point:  was playing my 26
warrior in a EF LDON group.  Leader had called it NBG.  We were a hostess
cupcake dream come true, 6 totally twinked players.  Only had one drop item -
will probably fetch 100 plat in the bazaar to the necro who was awarded it. I'm
extremly doubtful it was an *upgrade*, but he got it because he was the only
class that could *use* it.  The GL made the call, no one said a word. 
Whatever.  It didn't make me mad, it just seemed silly to award loot on NBG
with a bunch of level 20s wearing  40KP gear.
