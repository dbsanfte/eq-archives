For grinding exp hp only really matters if you're either expecting to
be in a life or death struggle (or up against AEing mobs, see below)
or you're getting chealed. The first situation also depends on a few
extra hp actually saving you; its very rare that this happens. The
second is only relevent to people expecting to tank with the defensive
capabilities to do so (obviously they should be getting as many hp as
they can). Someone doing regular exp grindage where they won't be
getting in any real danger (ie, not the tank or the cc) should be
focusing on maximizing their dps or support abilities (like mana
regen) though of course they shouldn't gimp themselves hp wise either
(besides, the best items give both). In an exp group I'd take a 4k hp
wizard with a 5k mana pool and the mana regen to maintain it over a 6k
hp wizard with a 3k mana pool who needs to med after a few fights. Or
put another way, more hp makes bad play (not necessarily yours) more
forgiving but maximizing your class role makes good play more
rewarding.

In a raid against mobs that do lots of damage to lots of people
(especially AE mobs) not going as all out as you reasonably can on hp
can not only get you killed but the entire raid as well, if you go
under frenzy health early and cause a mob to turn to kill you for
example. Getcher hp up if you wanna raid!
