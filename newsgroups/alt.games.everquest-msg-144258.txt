Eh, I use it (Fascination) on 4-6 dark blue critters (1-3 are usually few
enough for single-target).  The difference is, you have to have a healer you
can trust.  If 4-6 critters are coming your healer will know what you're
about to attempt, and the price of failure.  Once the healer heals you a
couple times THEY will get aggro, and the critters will be a lot easier to
mezz (off the cleric).

As to the CHA debate, at level 55+ (mine is 60 now) I haven't noticed ANY
difference between 115 and 200 CHA in stunning, mezzing or even charming.
HOWEVER, since I did NOT do any tests at lower levels I'd recommend you get
your CHA up to 150 (with buff & a few pieces of gear...not hard) if you're
going to be battling stuff you don't know are easy enough to mezz.

As for "That spell does not take hold," the ONLY time you see it is if they
already have a similar spell cast on them already.  Someone mentioned that
the critter may have been dot'd but that's not it.  You can easily mezz a
critter that's been dotted...though mez breaks a few seconds later. <g>
