You guys are getting seriously ripped off, then. (And I thought Xev had
about the worst pricing and inflation of all servers. Sheesh.) Before I
logged last night I popped over from Nexus into the bazaar. Sure enough,
there was a BA Medallion for 250 PP and two more for 300. Assuming
"prior to level 51" means somewhere in the forties (if we're worrying
about gear at that level, and travel to zones of all levels) that really
shouldn't be that much cash.

But why waste it on the neck slot, as you point out? If you are in your
forties, go to Jagged Pine and get in a group in the Gnoll caves.
Gnollish Rings of Sorcery drop like candy there and are better.

I'm not saying the ring is complete and utter crap, but it's far from
the best ring a caster will find. And it's usefulness will decrease
quickly as the caster continues to level. 

There's some great drops coming out of PoP already, at least until they
nerf the hell out of the items and the drop rates as per company policy.
But some of the quest stuff is utter dog poo poo.
