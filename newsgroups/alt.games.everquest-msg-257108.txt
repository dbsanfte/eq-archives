I realized this along the thread. :) I tried to say that with 9 spell
slots one would be ... more versatile?
And btw, I do think that even 9 slots isn't going to be enough. ;)
The only time I've ever been thinking what songs to load is on raids
with a few more attending bards and me not being the MT bard (just to
clarify this: I do not mean that I am the MT! Just that I'm in the MT's
group:)).
