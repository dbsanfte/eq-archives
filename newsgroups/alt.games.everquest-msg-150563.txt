So we went to Acrylia to fight the big under-water wurm thing.. totally new
fight for us.

8 people and 3 bots..
1 warrior (1 cleric and 1 wizard his bots)
1 shaman
1 cleric
me (monk) and my shaman bot
1 other monk
2 rogues
1 enchanter

Dunno what its HP is, but hes red con to a 60, hits for 650, has some green
con insta respawn fish that hurt (hi miscons!)  so the chanter was busy all
fight just keeping those mezzed.

MA engages, mob gets slowed, were all beating on it.. then I believe the
order of events went something like this: -
xx tells raid channel, "mob at 52%"
nonbot_cleric tells the group, "18% mana"
Rogue_1 has gone Linkdead
Warrior has gone Linkdead
Cleric_bot has gone Linkdead
Monk_1 has gone Linkdead
Wizard has gone Linkdead

Alaska had a powercut.. oh joy!

So this big parasite fish thing turns to me, and suddenly im MA.. we start
to plan the CR.
Shaman_1 starts chain healing me (my shaman only had torp up and cant use
that on an MA, so i chain casted pox and bane on the mob)
The cleric stops with the fast heal/huge mana spells, and gets it under
control to start chealing me

Mob gets to 5%, im at 200hp and realise a heal isnt coming.. the cleric is
oom.  As the only monk there (other still LD) I feign, in the event of
needing to drag corpses for CR.

My shaman dies.. oh well.  The other shaman dies.. oops.. the rogue is now
tanking.. warrior, cleric and monk log back in.. "damn that was cutting it
fine"

I get a heal, we now have a warrior and cleric with mana.. think damn what a
close fight this is, we've got it now..
Mob gets to 4%..3%..2%.. POOF

Wtf?  /rude verant :(
