An increase in attacks *is* a decrease in delay. Characters have no "attack"
variable AFAIK, and the number of attacks per minute is solely down to
weapon delay, extra attacks (dual-wield, double attack etc), and haste. The
only reason it is thought of as an increase in attacks is because it allows
you to apply the standard measurement of haste (e.g FBSS 21%) directly

So someone who attacks 100 times in a minute would attack 121 times with an
FBSS.

Whereas to apply a haste of 21% directly to the delay of a weapon would go
something like this.

Weapon delay                             20
Weapon delay with 21% haste:    20 - 21/10 = 17.9

This is how I understand it anyway, I could have gotten it wrong.
