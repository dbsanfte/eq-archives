Often times the Pally or SK are more attractive than the warrior for
their ability to gain, hold, and recapture aggro.

The Bard is *not* higher than the rnger and monk.  In fact I'm pretty
sure the Rogue would be a better tank in most situations.

LOL, is the pet tanking?

> 7 Monk

Despite the nerf, I still believe monks can out-tank rangers.  I'm not
certain, but I'm pretty sure they have higher natural HP and they seem
to take less damage than a comparably equiped ranger.  The only thing,
and it's a big one, that might tip the scales toward the ranger is his
ability to get aggro instantly and hold it forever.

Why even rank these?
