I find that press R is better than typing /r, because it automatically
starts your next command as /tell <name>. My brother sees me having chats in
/tell and tells me that I should use /r because it means less typing (he
thinks I'm actually typing the persons name every time). Of course, I have
one less character to press and if I get another tell between the one I'm
responding to and the one I'm sending I don't end up with a mistell. But try
telling HIM that...
