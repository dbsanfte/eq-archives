Cast sense animals a lot to raise divination. Put on any Int raising gear to
learn skills faster. I keep a stein of Mogguk around +10int to practice little
used skills with.

Bloodstone eyepatch is nice here, get the plat or velium ruby veils
when the jewelry skill is up there.

Runed Circlet.

I know what you said about the jewelry stuff but get some Velium jasper rings.
I like the Velium Jade rings as well, since they add ac mana and hp. Use the
plat ones if velium is too out of reach yet.

Yuck. Get an Ulthork hide tunic at least.

Mammoth cloak or a cloak of the Ry'gorr Oracles.

>

I'g go for crystalline belt.

Gatorscale leggs.

Not many choices here. Kolbold hide, dwarven work boots,
or GEBs. Or cultural.

> Haven't seen any wis leggings or boots for sale.

Wood elves and Halflings have +wis cultural boots. See if
you can find a high level smith or tailor for your race. Bring them
components and make trades with them.

Lots of choices here now. Get a velium etched stone mace at least.

Nice but I like a bit of AC as well. See if you can get a charred guardian shield.

Only mage summoned heat and cold stones really.
