I can 'fess up to being about the newest of the new- I signed up for
an account after testing the game from the CGW disk last month. I'm
just using the basic game; Kunark and Velious are just rumored and
mythical lands that I don't even dream about exploring yet.

Before Luclin came along, EQ played fairly well for me. I reconciled
myself to doing without sound, because my sound card- a Riptide- is
unsupported. I became used to disabling my virus protection and other
programs so that my measly 64 RAM could focus on the game and, mostly,
allow me to play without freezes or terrible lag.
Before Luclin, even though my system was pretty much limping along, I
was able to play the game, and pretty much enjoy myself.

Since the link to Luclin opened, I've found that my system just can't
handle things. Even with DirectX 8.1 installed, I'm coming up with
black bars obscuring the text on buttons, flickering light effects at
all times, and an outright black field of view in the default screen
mode (the other two modes are visible, but still sport the weird
flickering effect). The game goes in slow motion, from freeze to
freeze.

Clearly, there are two things, at least, that I need to do. I'll have
to get some new video card, because the current one, an Intel 810
chipset, seems not to be supported. And I'll need some RAM. A
compatible sound card would be nice, too.

What I'm wondering about is priority. I'm not sure that I'll be able
to get all these at once. So I'd be grateful for suggestions as to
which I need to look into getting first, and what brands would be best
for someone just playing basic EQ. I'm hoping that any responses you
folks can give me will make me better prepared for dealing with the
salesman at the local computer shop.

Thanks,

The Beatnik
