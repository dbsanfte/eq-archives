Yeah, that's why I don't do it beyond root/rotting Ice Giants or Seafury
Cyclops, other than in dungeons anyways, I love dungeon soloing nearly
anywhere (Mistmoore can die though).  I'm offering a suggestion to the moron
melees on how to finance their pottery, it would be equally profitable to go
kill a geonid or two in crystal caverns if you have that bent.

You've obviously never been a healer class of any sort.  I've played a
warrior to 30, so I'm perfectly aware of what the tanks go through, I also
take over my friend's 52 warrior from time to time when he goes AFK.  Hey,
guess what, MELEES HAVE IT EASIER SIR.

At least we agree on the loot dispute crap.

Ok, apparently you can't see that maybe some of my friends are unguilded, in
guilds that have stringent level limits (such as one whose guild I would
like to join but their limit is 58+), or in guilds that they're thinking of
leaving.  Not everyone is happily guilded with the same tag from 1-60 like
you.

As for 'fan club', feel free to come stalk me sir, I've already posted how
this works out.

I have a low moron tolerance (e.g. You).
I also rarely kite, in the event that I'm stuck soloing (I don't care if you
want me in your group, I'd rather take a sledgehammer to the nards than kill
spiders in Velk's) I usually hide out in a dungeon somewhere and root stuff
a lot.
