	Middle-Earth was a low-magic setting, completely unlike EQ.  Magic was
pretty much limited to craftwork and other lasting enchantments, except for
the Vaiar and they were beings of divine origin, not mortals.

	It is thus fallacious to assume that hobbits didn't have any kind of
priest class on the basis that they didn't use magic.  Paladins and Rangers I
agree don't fit (obviously); they had neither the need nor tempermant for
them.  We did not see enough to hobbit society to know what their religious
practices were like, but it would be pretty unusual for them not to have some
kind of priests.

|Warrior (Bilbo, Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin picked up combat skills

|classified as "warriors")

	Nonsense; there were armed and capable hobbits all over the place in the
Shire, especially at the end of the book.  There were a number of Sherrif
houses for keeping the peace -- again, it would be pretty unusual to find a
culture that did not have some kind of soldier or peacekeeper role.

|Haflings (and most of the other content in the genre) in EQ are a

|Hobbits as Tolkein created..

	This is what is called a cop-out.  If they wanted to make their own race,
they should have.  They used the standard Tolkein rip-offs for easy player
recognition, and have to live with the consequences of that choice.
