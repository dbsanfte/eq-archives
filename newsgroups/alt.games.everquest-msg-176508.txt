all tradeskills will use whatever is the higher of your INT or WIS to
determine your skillup rate.

fletching adds DEX as a tertiary check, because rangers generally have a
little difficulty getting their INT/WIS up, but their DEX is usually sky
high.

smithing adds STR as a tertiary check, since warriors are kinda like rocks
in a lot of respects, and smithing seems like something a warrior should be
able to do.

depending on who you talk to, there may be more skills that have tertiary
checks, but those are the only two that pretty much everybody agrees on.

note that these stats only determine how quickly your skill will improve.

the only stat that determines your success rate is your skill level.
