That's one of the primary points I've been trying to make. If you don't 
care, then why are you here? Do you take some kind of pleasure in 
offending people or being quick to take offense. *You* look at the 
beginning of this thread and remember what *horrible* things were said to 
send you off in a tizzy. You're no less at fault here. Sure, you weren't 
given the benefit of the doubt, yet you immediately presented yourself as 
someone who didn't deserve it anyway.

Please pardon some for being cynical, but they do have reason to be so. 
Web forums are notorious for being nothing more than virtual playpens. I 
do hope EMarr doesn't fall into that category. That said, *you're* the 
only ones who can prove that.
