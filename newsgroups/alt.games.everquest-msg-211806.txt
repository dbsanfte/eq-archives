I think I can relate to your position.

I tend to believe in god, but I don't believe in religion.  In my mind,
religion is so *obviously* bunk, that I'm unusually annoyed when people
don't *see* that truth.

Some days, I don't believe in god.  Most days, I do.  Partly out of an
admitted psychological need and partly because I can't understand how
the universe could exist without god.

So, in my mind, I am constantly trying to determine where my own
spirituality stands.  The one constant is that I firmly disbelieve in
religion (being defined as the typical major ones).
