Yeah, 
eqdruids.com

if you are a druid.

Everlore I find about worthless anymore unless
I have a need to hear abuot a naked newbie event on some server, which
oddly enough I never do.
Caster's realm still mostly posts actual info so I use it. I think in
the past it was proved a couple of times that both of them get info
from each other (when a totally erroneous story popped up on several)
so its an either or kind of thing.

For example right now everlore has like 6 different things saying that
there were events in the zones which the same events happened in on
every single server except for some reason Everlore has them in server
by server paragraphs. its pretty much a news "filler" site for EQ or
if you find lil blurbs about player "roleplaying" events on servers
you are not on interesting. Right now it does actually have real news
because the halloween stuff gave it a reason to make new posts
actually.


Eqtraders.com 

is of course nice if interested in trades, or even selling trade
supplies to people who are (moderately profitable while letting
someone else get carpal tunnel syndrome) This is the best site for
recipes, recipe solving on the message boards and general trade hints
and info from the message boards. The message board used by many
expert traders sharing their knowledge is what really makes this site
great.


http://slownewsday.net/

formerally lums, is about the best general "rumors about mmorpgs and
how much they suck" site. Its kind of nice because they present the
news in more of an honest way than sites like caster's realm or
everlore with their lips firmly pressed against the buttocks of
Verant. I guess because I'm kind of pragmatic and/or pessimistic also
its very much my style of site. 

For example this is a quote about the pretty much "non story"
beginning in AO (where the writer admits that on his dial-up
connection working for a living he did not have time to download 100
meg of movies to see the "story" and he saw no story in game at all)

"If you hype something for months, it's a good idea to actually make
that thing at least moderatly interesting when it rolls out. I feel
like someone promised me a unicorn and then showed me a goat glued to
a rolled-up paper tube. The fact that the goat was already lame and
covered in feces just makes it worse. "

You just won't get the "covered in feces" quotes from your typical
only EQ newsite ;) Some people call it a "rant" site, but I call it
equal time. You only need so many sites that simply report that funcom
started the story or that Verant did this, after that I want a site
that honestly says if it sucked ass or not.
