oh bs. The rich are rich because they keep making good choices , the poor
are poor because they keep making poor ones. A pure capitalist society works
better than anything else , and incidently we proved it to the world yet
again since it is so easy to forget. The uninted states went in 200 years
from a colony to the richest , most powerfull country the world has ever
seen. We did it through capitalism ie a merit based society. The poor here
complain about how much it costs to own a car , the poor in other countries
quite correctly are worried about where the next meal is comming from and
whether that will be tomorrow or next week.
