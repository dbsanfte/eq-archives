Here is a way Verant can promote Grouping with all classes which is what
they seem to want. All Buffs with the exception of what you cast via spell
or item wear off 5 min after the the caster leves the group. No longer will
casters sit in bazaar waiting to buy KEI so they can solo, will vastly
improve Shamans trade, Druids and Wizards porting, escorting services. For
major Raids allow the raid leader to invite groups so you would have a Raid
leader and 5 groups. Now that would be a Nerf for all classes to whine
about.
