I don't even bother looting anything but coin, so you can rule out the first
one.  :)  I sure as hell don't take the time to loot and destroy the junk. 
Let the bodies rot!

I do generally have a mule parked in zone, either grouped so I can
periodically split, or set off to the side so I can just go hand off money. 
Keep it all and have your mule bound right at a bank.  :)

And option #3 is the biggest part.  You don't need a shaman partner to heal
up your pet after the 3rd or 4th giant.  Just reclaim and summon another pet
and get to work.  Magicians really are the absolute best possible HG
killers.  I'd say the shaman might have added 25% to your kill rate, maybe. 
And that was 50% of your loot.  If you enjoy having the shaman around, for
extra safety or just cause he's a nice guy, that's worth it.  But if it's
just some random guy, you're not doing yourself any favors.
