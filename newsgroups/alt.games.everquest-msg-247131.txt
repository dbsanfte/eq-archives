What I have seen and what has turned me off to it is that the POV for
the game is third person. You know, the behind and up view of your
character and his world with a 360 degree pan. I can find no reference
that first person view is available. Frankly I like to see through my
character's eyes, it is more immersive and I feel less like a puppet
master and more like the character. IMO, this was chosen to attract
not all of us who are likely to come and try it as many of us are MMOG
fans, but to tap into their RTS Warcraft/Diablo base who, if you make
it look like their RTS game, might give it a try.

To me it's a more complex version of Diablo, but in the end I have a
personal dislike for MMOG where I can't have a first person POV. Your
mileage may vary.
