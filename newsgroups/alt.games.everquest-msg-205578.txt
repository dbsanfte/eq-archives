Back before I joined a full-time raiding guild (and back when the level cap
was still 60), a warrior by the name of Medaman would regularly form a group
of people who knew how to play their class and we'd go crawl.  Chardok was
great... we went down to places I never knew existed.  Did you know you can
bank in Chardok?  I didn't.  =)

Another good place was Dragon Necropolis... it's a large, creepy zone with a
wide variety of monsters.  We'd start by triggering the dragon construct
traps, check to see if the spider queen was up, intentionally trigger all
the bug traps, then dire charm a rat and move into the rat mazes.

It was incredibly fun.  With Medaman, we never did a camp.  We did a
dungeon.  And we got loads and loads of XP, gems, and good item drops.

The point being that you *can* dungeon crawl at any level if you can find a
good group.  And they better be good, because CR's in dungeons that don't
have graveyards can be a major pain, especially for out-of-the-way places
like Dragon Necropolis.

Of course, I'm talking of higher-end dungeons.  Where you can go from 40-50,
I'm not sure.  Perhaps one of the new LoY zones... when I was wandering
around invis with Monual, I saw a couple of places that looked mildly
interesting.
