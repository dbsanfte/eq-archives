Zerg alliances suck. Did Agnarr with 40 people? Behemoth with a guild raid
force? Maybe grummus took the slap down from your minimal guild raid force.
Use tactics to defeat an encounter? Why? take 100+ people by randomly
spamming zones instead and then filling up all the tier 3 zones full of
shits that in no way have the abilities for the areas.

Moot point anyway once they open up these zones in next patch. Halls of
Honour etc gonna be crawling with idiots. Happy that they open new zones for
people who stand no chance of getting into them and are feeling bored with
the game  but unhappy at the stench it gonna cause in these zones.
