I've had experience leveling my friend's Druid from 32 to 50. I got it
all... "Port me plz", "PL me plz", "Buff me, damnit" etc... my response was
tailored for my circumstances. (Yes or no depending on how busy I was, or a
rude "Shove it" if I was treated poorly) And the -entire- time I never
openly charged, or hinted that I wanted money for my services. Was I paid?
You bet, but that doesn't matter to me. Most times people had to /split x x
x x just for me to accept money. I'm not a businessman, I'm a game-player.

I agree... but I still think you should say "Sorry, I'm too busy to rez
you." Running around with /AFK and /anon (or /roleplay) seems rather
cowardly... or at least it's like you're evading something that cannot
really harm you.

Those are the punks that think they're something special. All you generally
have to do is keep your language above them (avoid using an excessive
profanity). Any idiot and rant, rave, piss, moan, and cry but if you can
keep your honour and dignity, you immediately made the other person seem
like the true vermin he or she is.

I almost never die, I'm resourceful like that <Smirk>. But when I do die,
it's a big kick in the chin and it shoots my dignity to hell. -The last
thing I'd like to tolerate is some Cleric that is rude enough just to ignore
me. Any response is better than none.
