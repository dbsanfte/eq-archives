Before pop I would have agreed with you. Fighting mobs that con red at 60 is
a blast when you dont have to worry about cr's, and its just pick up groups.
Personally I think it would be a good move if they had returning corpses, or
even respawn with equipment for all zones. Sure it would make it easier, but
cr's just totally suck imho. not fun.
