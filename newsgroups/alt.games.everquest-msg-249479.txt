I've never had a stack of either rusty weapons or any kind of armor. 
How did you accomplish that?

IMO, best noob zones:

-For tradeskill loot: Everfrost Peaks.  Spiderlings, spiders, bears,
wolves, as well as skeletons if you need bonechips.  The tradeskill
mobs are EVERYWHERE.  Keep leveling here to 10 or so?  There are
tougher mobs out in the open area once you master the wuss mobs in the
maze of snowy paths.

-For lots of close mobs, taking little time to pull: Kurn's Tower from
level 7 or 8 through maybe 14 or so.  (Don't go deep in, it's not
worth it).  Save up stacks of bone chips.  I took my necromancer here
and, with a little extra help from what I looted with my main and
maybe a few stack that I vendor-farmed, only recently (few days ago)
ran out of bonchips.  My necro is level 57...

-For a noob zone that feels like an "adventure", I always loved
Blackborrow.

-For the best place to find a partner or a group: Crushbone.  (I hate
grouping at low level though...worse exp than soloing since you spend
half your time teaching people how to play, half the group members are
higher in player level than they are in player's age, healers think
they are melee and melee think they need to loot everything instead of
actually turning autoattack on, etc...)

-Oh and last and probably least, best place to hunt at low levels if
you are also hoping to get drive-by buffs from the high level players:
Paineel/Warrens.
