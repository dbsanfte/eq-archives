Aye, I remember it as one of the best and one of the worst days in my MMOG
history. One of the worst because of the incredible,
had-to-be-experienced-to-be-believed lag (entering Britain you would take
one step and wait about 3 minutes to take the next), and one of the best
because of the heady excitement and historic nature of the event. Here was
Lord British, addressing the assembled masses in one of the first major
commercial graphical MMOGs, bringing the Ultima universe to life, and Rainz
takes him out with a firewall scroll, lol! And then of course we all died as
Blackthorne unleashed Demons on all of us. Oh man, what a day...
