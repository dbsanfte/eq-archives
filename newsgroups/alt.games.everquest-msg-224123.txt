Good day,

Dekark is enjoying his first few outing out of Freeport immensely. However
he has a hard time dealing with poisons and stuns.... He also has a great
fear of things like POKs such that he will be probably be of a ripe old age
if he ever use it.

Considering that he is a monk, what can he do to minimise his "stuinning"
behavior and how can he reduce/heal poisonous effect before they endanger
him?

Thanks
