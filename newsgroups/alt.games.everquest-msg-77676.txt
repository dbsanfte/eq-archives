With a new guild of less experienced players:

Figure out your core raiding contingent. There are people who are
absolutely essential. If you have a 55+ warrior, a CoTH-capable mage,
a 52+ enchanter, a 57+ necromancer, a 56+ or epic cleric, a 55+ monk,
a 54+ shaman, a 55+ rogue, or a 55+ bard, treat them like gold. Get
them to XP-group with the most experienced players in your guild at
least three times for at least four hours each. Fundamentally, you
want the six most raid-capable people in your guild to get some
significant time playing together so that they, at least, can work
like a well-oiled machine. These will ultimately be your pull team--at
least in early going.

Once your pull team is in place, get your second team together. You
want a balanced group, all 47+. If your primary group CC person is
sufficiently capable, you don't need one in your second group. But,
ideally, you'd like the second group to cement together like the first
one, so balance is better.

Next, take the two groups somewhere they can work together as a raid.
The quest in Fungus Grove is a good start as are a number of mid-range
epic quests. I particularly like the FG quest because it (a) can yield
significant loot if done all the way through (b) require significant
coordination with the two groups and (c) can recover quickly from a
TPW. If your schedule allows it, a great second raid is Xalgoz, which
also a way to get your guild HS capable. It's even possible to bring
three groups to this raid, but don't expect everyone to get fangs.

After these two or three steps, you're good and ready to try a planes
raid. Fear is easiest if you have a CotH-capable mage. Otherwise, Hate
is more doable.

Limit your first raid to 24. Make sure that you either have people who
have done the plane before and/or have as many people as you can read
up on how to work the zone. Keep your minimum level as high as
possible. Make sure that your loot rules are made well in advance and
that everyone coming knows what they are.

Once you've done your first Fear or Hate raid, you'll have a better
idea of your capabilities.
