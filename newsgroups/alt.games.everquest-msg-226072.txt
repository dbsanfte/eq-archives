This is what we thought when LDoN was first released, but it seems to be 
false; I've had many friends report that they were perfectly able to go 
on LDoN missions without their adventurer's stones.

I -did- hear but have not confirmed even at secondhand, that you can't 
use the Magus transport system without one.

At any rate, what the stone really is is an augment; a type of item that 
can be attached to existing items to add to their power.  Its a funny 
kind of one, though, it can only be applied to charms (not a whole lot 
of charms out there), and it does nothing at all for them at first, or 
Ever if you don't have LDoN.


As you run more missions, you can go and talk to a person in each camp; 
get 10 successful missions in a camp and your stone gets a small 
improvement to its stats.  I think mine is currently 1 hp and 1 mana, or 
perhaps 2 and 2.

I've heard that at the high end, this is actually a worthwhile augment, 
but its kind of hard to believe considering how crappy it is right now.

On the plus side, it works kind of like charms; stats set based on flags 
on your character, rather than like normal items or even augments. 
Decide to destroy the one you have and get another because you have a 
new charm to put it on, and the new one has the same stats as the old 
one you had before, like you'd never destroyed it.

Its possible to get little charm items by spending very low amounts of 
mission points in LDoN; charms that add from 1 to 5 points to a single 
stat, ONLY while on an LDoN mission.  I bought one of those just so I'd 
have somewhere to stick my stone.  5 int item (only when in LDoN, 
nothing outside), plus that 1 mana and 1 hp; wow, well worth buying LDoN 
to get that upgrade!
