I can fully understand where all the ill will comes from anyway. For every
touristy mug like the Chimp bumbling around regularily killing himself on an
auctioned character (but harming no-one else) there would proberly be some
<other> clueless cretin or two wiping out entire raids on auctioned level
50+ characters and being generally onoxious on some self perceived power
trip.

I can also see how someone on a brought character decked out in Primal who
dickwaves about it would be annoying too. But I cannot understand how
someone would feel their own accomplishments belittled by a character like
the Gimp though. To me it's just a child happily paddling away in a wading
pool with floaties on wondering why the state championship guys next door in
the Olympic pool are crying unfair advantage?

Sometimes I think some people see EQ in too much black and white, and maybe
not realise there are so many different ways to enjoy EQ apart from the race
to 60, Uber Gear and feeling of accomplishment. The feeling of
accomplishment has never been a factor for me mainly because I am so
terrible at EQ, in the immortal words of Magnus: "Verily I Doth Sucketh".
The closest I get to it is when some hairbrained tactic actually leaves me
alive by some bizzare chain of events...

It doesn't stop me sitting back and relaxing after work in Norrath though -
and having a damn lot of fun along the way as well.

As for Dark Snow - I would place a red hot poker in my eye before having any
dealings with a "proffessional *cough* broker" like them. They are easy to
identify on the auction sites thankfully - they sell the majority of the
items too as opposed to characters and have a high rating against their
handles. Anyone whose business plan includes litigation need a swift kick in
the head - lawyers have sucked enough blood out of the worlds economy
already. I won't argue about that ; )
