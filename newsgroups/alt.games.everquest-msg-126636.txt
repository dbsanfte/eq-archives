Hmm, every one of those an item I've never heard of, funny how the
items I have with III effects are relatively common ones... oh wait I have
heard of Obulus Death Shroud.  Other than that guess I have some
research to do as to where they drop or what the going rate is.

I mean couldn't care less but the expression is could care less.  I suppose
its like calling huge biker thugs "tiny" or more likely its just a mistake
thats been enshrined... but frankly I could care less.

Aha, but the cost of peridot is, as I"ve said many times, negligible, and
my understanding (limited as it may be) is that focus items of this
nature only work 10% of the time anyway.  I'm -not- going to
throw away good bracers on the RMB stats in order to save 10pp out
of 100.  My druid alt is wearing a RMB at the moment, I think, if
you can convince me the savings is substantial perhaps I'll transfer
it to my cleric for wearing in pre raid buffing.

Because clerics now have a DOT line.  Undead only, mind you.  And the
first two are actually less efficient than nukes.  But the third is quite
efficient, HP per mana wise.  Cleric Roots are from what I can see
far more reliable than druid roots (probably because they only get
one resist instead of two) and its entirely possible for clerics over (54 I
think?)
to root rot undead getting more kills per hour for less risk than they
do root DD reroot DD kiting.  If my DOTs lasted longer that would
be more HP for the mana spent.. as long as the mob doesnt die
before the DOT runs out.  If my DOTs are cheaper to cast then
thats also a higher HP per mana ratio, with the mana side dropping.
In either case you take whats already an efficient way to do some
solo exp/loot gathering and make it more so.

I also use my higher level undead DOT in some group and even
raid situations, although only in ones where we are sure there
are no unmezzable adds that might show up, and with extreme
caution.  It is of quite short duration, and as I say, high damage
to mana ratio, while the lower two DOTs rarely get all their
damage in  before mob death (making them even less efficient
damage producers) the third one usually manages to get
its full effect in.  If I have C3 on and a bard singing mana to
me most pulls see using less mana healing than I"m getting
back, so doing some damage is preferable to sitting on my
butt like a common cleric.

Wishing he could recall the name of that DOT.. know right
where it is in the spell book too!
