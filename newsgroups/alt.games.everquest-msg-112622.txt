   Naw, Cabilis is just as close.  My Barb shaman bound my
husband's Ogre warrior there with no problems.  At the LoIO
entrance to the city there is only one wandering guard,
easily avoided if you keep your eyes open, and  two
stationary ones guarding the zone into the city that have
very short agro ranges. Just run in between the center of
the two and you'll be fine.  I had my husband click off SoW
to see if that made any sort of difference in the
survivability of that bind point, and it didn't.  If you are
hunting in the lake, this is a perfectly reasonable place to
be bound.

Annie <--- Also bound a lizard there while she there, who
seemed startled to see her there.
