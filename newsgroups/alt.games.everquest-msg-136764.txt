I can say this with all sincerity:

Make a new cleric.  Get him up to level 50.  Then go and play your level 53
cleric.

Dude, there is nothing as dangerous as an ebay-ed cleric.  (Yes, I know you
didn't get him off ebay, but you meet all the requirements... got a
high-level character in a class you've never played before.)

Knowing what buffs to apply, to whom, and when.

Knowing what heals you have, and who to use them on.

Knowing when to cast Divine Aura.

My goodness, the mind boggles.

By level 50, good clerics have a good feel for healing.  They watch their
group member's health intently - not just to see how much health they have,
but how fast it's falling.  Timing when to cast a Complete Heal on the Main
Tank is an essential skill, and not something that can be learned by any
other method than raw experience.

You won't learn this by duo-ing with someone.  The dynamics are so
different.  In a two-person group, you don't interrupt a Complete Heal on
the warrior to cast a Remedy on the chanter, for example.

My goodness, I could go on and on and on.

If you're *really* into trying the short way, try to get a group of 50+
folks that don't mind dying as you learn.  A decent place to learn the
basics is Velk's, where tactics don't matter so much.  After you feel
comfortable casting CH's and whatnot, take your Dead Group Walking over to
Chardok or the Dog Tower in KC and learn how to deal with multi-mob pulls
where mobs are beating on the chanter while the tank dips below twenty
percent health.

Whatever you do, don't join a pick-up group.  You'll get people killed and
utterly destroy your reputation.  Trust me, there's nothing so damning as
getting labeled as an "ebay" character.

There is no shortcut for experience - and I'm not talking about "Ding 50!"
experience either.  You don't take someone who's never driven a car before
and enter them into the Indy 500.

Just my two cents.  =)

Good luck with your new cleric, but I fear using him won't be as easy as you
expect.
