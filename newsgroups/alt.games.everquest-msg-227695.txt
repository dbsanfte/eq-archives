Maybe in a group - I am not sure, but solo things tend to be pretty hectic
and full on as there is little if any med time to speak of on a Necro.

I am currently hoping my baby Wizard becomes less reliant on medding as it

literally am having periods of trying hard to stay awake during the extended
med breaks on the Wizard.
