What is a good exp zone for a level 50 monk/shaman combo in any expansion?
Preferably a place with a lot of high 30s/low 40s mobs, few chain-nukers,
and an exp bonus.  Sol B kobolds and bats are not bad, however, the bats are
usually camped and the kobolds are starting to turn light blue.  Tried lower
guk but there was a mass-AE powerleveling session going on and a train of
half the dead side + shaman = death.  Grieg's End was recommended, so we're
probably going to check that out pretty soon.  Any other suggestions?
Thanks in advance!
