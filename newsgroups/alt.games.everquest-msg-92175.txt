You know anything about DirecTV? That's who I do tech support for. If
there's really bad weather or the dish is out of alignment, a message
appears on the screen saying "Searching for satellite signal". Wanna
guess how many calls we get asking if something happened to our
satellite? (Really, if our satellite was down, you think you would
have been holding less than 3 hours given DTV has millions of
customers?) Or saying we need to resend the signal to them? (It's a
satellite feed. It's broadcast nationally. There are no specific feeds
to each dish.)

Worst one was someone who actually expected us to move the satellite
so her dish could get the signal... ( First, that'd take millions of
dollars and a shuttle launch. Second, it would knock out the other
millions of customers who do have their dish aligned right... )

Let's see...there's always resetting the receiver. Unplug the receiver
from the power outlet..."But I can't get to the dish to unscrew the
cable!"

The list goes on. Some people shouldn't even be allowed to TOUCH
anything technical...
