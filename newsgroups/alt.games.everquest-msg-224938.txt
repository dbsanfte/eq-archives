Yeah, and let me tell you, I intend to bust out of this level 52 hold as
fast as I can once my friends are back online and caught up. I am about 3
little blue ticks from hitting 53 now and with the kind of experience I'm
getting from LDoN adventures, 55 and 59 won't be that far off once I'm back
on 100% leveling experience. I look forward to experiencing the new worlds
open to me as I approach these new heights. It's been far more fun this time
around than any time previous.
