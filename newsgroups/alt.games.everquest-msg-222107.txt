I don't know much about Mages.  However I can tell you that once you
learn the ins and outs of PoJ, it has some neat features for soloing. 
For example, very few things start out KoS to you and you can explore
much of the area safely.  Mobs range in level from maybe 45 all the
way to 60.  Pulls are generally pretty safe and pulling singles isn't
all that tough if you learn the zone and know where to fight.

One reason I thought about it when you asked is your level.  At level
57 and 58, you get to the point where you can pull a large area of the
zone with absolutely zero social aggro.  (Up to that point the social
aggro can be a real bitch).  This means you can run in and grab a
level 55 Gaoler (one of the guards--no faction hit) and pull it back
and fight right in the hallways if you wish, since the lower level
guards around you will just walk right on by.  Just don't try this
until you are at least 57.  In fact I think you may need 58 or 59. 
Test it out if you want...
