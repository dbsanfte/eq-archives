At 43, the ones between the zone and the graveyard are green enough
that I can easily kill them even when they swarm.  From there, it's
easy to go behind the graveyard and up the hidden staircase, and
things up above generally come in just 2's and 3's, easy enough
to tackle that way (I often Root one and then pull back to fight
the other solo, then finish off the Rooted one).
