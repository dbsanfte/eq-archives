Not really talking "Please come rez me, I'll give you a ride over and
pay." It sounds more like "please come rez me, I'll give you a ride
over." and the cleric responding "only if you pay me 100p".

I offer pay for every time I'm rezzed, too. I won't take a rez if
payment is demanded up-front. I've never offered 100p because, well,
I've never been able to afford to shell that out. I've only had one
person accept payment...
