Get a necromancer to cast snare and fear on the mobs, he
can also take care of the little healing you will need,
and can suck down any passing mob you aren't interested
in to keep his HP up while converting HP to mana so he
never runs dry.

With care, he can also help out by doing some damage
to your mobs, but he'll have to be careful to do less than
half.

As for where, anywhere with mobs the necro can single
pull, and sufficient running room for them to saunter slowly
away from you while you practice backstabbing.  Indoor
zones are prefered because they most often have a "ZEM"
which gives you more exp per mob.  Paladul Caverns
bandits can be pulled back towards the Shadowhaven
zone line and then chased back towards their camp, for
example.

Another excellent plan would be to get a high level
druid with a pet, have her DS you and the pet both,
as well as regen and HP buffs on both.  Now you
"porcupine" the mob while the pet nibbles away
at it, and every time BS comes up, you evade and
let the pet get hit a bit while you stab.  DS damage
doesn't count for the "who did more" total, and
you really should be able to outdamage the patheticness
that is a druid pet.   You'd have the druid for
healing, but without a KEI, this will end up meaning
spending some of your time waiting for her to get mana
back up.  Nice thing about this plan, though, is that
the DS damage markedly speeds up killing without
giving the "kill" to the caster, and getting hit raises
your Defense skill, which often sucks on a rogue,
and which PLing frequently leaves idle.
