As far as whos more important to pick up groups, last time I checked
we were all paying the same money. Hmm but I wont go too far into that
one.
Played over a year, have 4 chars at 55 or higher but thats no big
deal. Doesnt take that to figure this stuff out.
Based it the same thing everyone bases things on, personal experience.
Seen a lot of skills on chars that were difficult to raise playing a
melee char in a group as it should be played. Will the solo monk or
the grouped one have the higher bind wound? Dodge? Defense? Does the
solo player or the grouped one rely on someone else to save his bacon
when he screws up? But I digress....Seen a lot of melees that have
NEVER pulled a mob for themselves unless it was level 10 or below.
This game isnt rocket science , grouping skills are easy, one two days
tops ya got it nailed. Now char skills are different on melee classes,
you must be in combat to raise them and you must be pounded on a lot
to raise some. End of line...
