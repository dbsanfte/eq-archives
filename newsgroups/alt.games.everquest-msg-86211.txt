You are correct that wizards are not generally a first choice for exp
grind groups. I think this is largely due to mispreceptions about what
wizards contribute though. My 52 wiz can keep up throwing one nuke on
each pulled mob, even without clarity, and that one nuke is doing a
substantial contribution to damage. If you throw in some opportunities
for AE, wizards can easily keep up with the damage/time rate of tanks.
The most productive exp grind groups I've been in have been AE groups.

It's worth noting too that while the melee damage is free, the mana to
heal/debuff/buff is not, so there are mana costs to a melee heavy
group that can cause downtime. Tanks stop pulling when the cleric says
LOM.
