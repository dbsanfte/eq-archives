I was wondering i fanyone knows how to Screen out Chat like OTHERS MISSES and 
NPC SPELLS....and the likes.   My Text FLYS in combat...cant read whats going 
on especially with a good Monk in the group.

heh heh

I used to be able to do it in teh OPTIONS section....but now I cannot.  I 
simply cannot click on the Icon.  Somethings I can change but not the chat 
stuff.

It did work at one time...then just stopped.

Does anyone know of a KB command  or file to alter so I do not have to see 
misses and things?

Thanks
