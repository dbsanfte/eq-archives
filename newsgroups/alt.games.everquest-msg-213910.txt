Its as though you are deliberately missing the point here.

You extoll Darkness line for its snarelike virtues, and when people tell you
that the Snare line of spells is superior to the Darkness line, you keep
responding as though we were saying that Darkness is useless.  Its not useless,
it does the Snare part of the job, and thats a very good thing, its simply not
as good at doing the Snare job as the Snare line is.

Since you mention that Darkness overwrites movement spells, it seems possible
you aren't aware that Snare also overwrites movement spells.

Your comments don't address a comparison between darkness and snare lines as a
means of achieving the snare effect, they just keep going on about how cool the
snare effect is.  Well, we know that part and agree... which doesn't mean we
agree that darkness is better than snare for getting that effect.

Yes, again, the snare effect is really all that and a bag of chips.  But Snare
and Ensnare slow the movement rate down on mobs and players just as well, plus
they stick a lot more often if resists are an issue, and they don't do any
damage, so they don't break mez and they don't DOT so they don't keep breaking
mez during their entire duration.  Plus if you happen to be doing one of the
many things that allows a mob to live more than 2 minutes, Ensnare has a much
much longer duration.  Ever play with your necro charm spells?  Ensnared pets
are a good thing.  Darknessed pets, on the other hand, not so good, likely as
not the darkness wears off before the charm... not to mention you are damaging
your own pet if you keep it in the Dark!

If you don't need a 14 minute snare you use Snare, which has a duration similar
to that of Darkness... but it doesn't do any damage.  Here you are dragging up
the duration arguement as a straw man, the point you are replying to centers
around the DOT feature.  Duration is a seperate discussion entirely.  An
interesting one, mind you, but it has nothing to do with point 3) above.
