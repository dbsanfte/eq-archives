Sounds like a good place for me to reiterate my offer.

If you are on Ayonae Ro and have a monk alt and want 4-5 pieces of Wu
armor (which is all I have left and I wont make any other pieces for
under 2k per slot), for free, get your alt to Kelethin bank if you are
human, dont get too close to town if you are Iksar, throw Kadath on
your friends list and find me when I'm online.  I'll give you one of
each that I have left.

I cant give Wu stuff away fast enough, and I refuse to sell it to a
vendor.

Definitly have tunic, pants,  and caps, might have 1 other slot
available.   Other pieces made for 2k each slot up front =)
