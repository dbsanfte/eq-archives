Only one per player, so the landscape doesn't usually get cluttered.
Dungeons, on the other hand...

In EQ, I think the record for corpse clutter was a Fear raid on my
server, by my guild (a long time ago, before I was a member) that went
very very wrong, and everyone died.  The several corpse recovery
attempts also failed, with everyone dying.  Other guilds came to help,
and died.  There were so many corpses at the zone in, that no matter
how good your system was, it was not possible to zone in and live.
You were killed by the mobs there before your client got done trying
to draw the first frame!

Even though Verant's policy at the time was that the planes were
entirely "at your own risk" zones and there would be no help, even for
bugs, so many people were going to lose everything that Verant could
not ignore it, and the GMs depopped the zone so people could go and
and get their corpses.  By then, many people had lost several levels
on the failed attempts at CR, but at least they got their items back.
