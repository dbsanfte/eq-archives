Sorry, my news server was rebuilt over the weekend and wasn't exactly 
stable.  When a news server is rebuilt it generally renumbers the 
articles which make it so that everything is marked read, and it messed 
up the threading.  I also generally reply to articles as I read them, 
unless it's obvious that there are more in the thread, and then I may 
check them out first.  However, due to the aforementioned issues with my 
newsserver, these article were not visable when I was replying.  

I'm sure that you have never responding to an article that someone else 
has already responded too.
