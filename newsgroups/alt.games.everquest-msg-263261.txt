Thanks guys! Sirens dead. Now to face the horrors of sirens grotto. :P

I looked over the list of ingredients... molkors hide (noone sells), ulthork
tusks (ditto), royal kromrif (5 k!), swordfish tooth (no drop, tough mob for
a 59 druid to solo)... argh. I figure the blood might be obtainable if i
raid, but i haven't seen kael raids in over a year. Is there a channel
people use for this? I'm on rodcet nife. It's either that or i try to find a
guild that a) would be interested in kael raids b) operates in sydney time
:-(

Bah! Back to trying to repair my pc for a while.
