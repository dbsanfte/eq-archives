Logged in successfully, no downloads, fast as its ever been...
but all servers are locked.  If I had my copy of PoP in my hot
little hands I'd be able to log on and register it, anyway.  Of
course the local EB told me release date is the 22nd... so what
the Brell are they doing today?

I've heard that the real release date is today, anyway, which
will be irritating, I was hoping to play today, then I have to go
offline for a couple days, and figured some of the massive
multipatch would have worn down by the time I got back.
