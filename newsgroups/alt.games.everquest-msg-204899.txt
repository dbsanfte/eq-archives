ok, forgot some stuff on my list I guess

Dwarf palladin (lvl 40)

collar is Spider fur collar
visor is enchanted dwarven plate visor
I do have a chitin shield in the bank when I use 1h weapons, but mostly
working on 2hs  for now till I get it really high(epic skill)

most of my gear was donated, except a few upgrades to have SOMETHING better,
the weapon was my largest upgrade lately

I have like 800pp, so guess I'll wait till after a few farming missions for
those 2k handwraps and stuff,
I am planning on the crystal caverns trip with some of my guildies or
friends,

still don't know how some people can buy horses in their 30's guess if they
take time off from leveling it works, or those permanent traders (I feel bad
leaving mine on all day when I'm at work)

ok, hope this helps clear some things up
