Yes it is. It's called "rewarding the player instead of the toon".
Basically, CoH is all about the gameplay (initially: all about the
combat), not about the "better than the Joneses" equipment hunting
prevalent in every other MMOG out there. It's the MMORPG genre
stripped to it's core.

CoH's problem is the same problem as in every level-based MMORPG: You
level in order to do the same thing you did at a lower level, except
with bigger numbers all around. There's really no difference between
some lowbie street punk hitting you for 5% of your hitpoints at level
5 and some big-ass alien boss hitting you for 5% of your hitpoints at
level 50.

The Other MMORPGs simply throw a bunch of trinkets at you to dilute
this fact. However, they also end up balancing the game so that you
actually NEED these "trinkets" to compete, making it easy for two
characters of the same level to be vastly different in their power
level simply based on what gear they have been able to obtain.

CoH does not have that problem.
