I don't think it's that at all.  The point is: a person who was never a
regular of the newsgroup comes and tells us that he tried the game for 30
minutes and thought it was terrible because it wasn't exactly like UO.

What purpose does it serve to come to newsgroup devoted to people who enjoy
the game and tell them that he hates it?  It's a troll, nothing more, and we
respond in that manner.

I don't accept that he was honestly trying to sell the game - why come to a
newsgroup where all the people already *have* the game and try to sell it?
There are a thousand other places to go.

He simply wanted to thumb his nose in our general direction, and we let him
have it.  I'd expect nothing less if I went to alt.games.diablo and told
them that I thought the game was a sad waste of my money.
