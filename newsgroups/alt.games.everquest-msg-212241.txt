Supposedly most (all?) mobs in EQ use one of two AI's (considering
only agro here).  The "undead" AI used by most undead has a much
larger proximity modifier than the "normal" AI (I've seen an undead
mob pulled via Snare turn and agro somebody as it went by him, you
won't see a goblin doing that unless the victim is sitting and you
pull the goblin right over him).

I've certainly verified that you have to _really_ piss an undead
mob off to agro it away from a melee that's in its face unless
you also get in the mob's face.  OTOH, most (all?) giants (for
example) are much more easily distracted (I suspect that the much
larger melee reach of giants plays some part in that as well).

In my experience it works better to be aware of what your casters
are doing and use Taunt situationally.  Otherwise you may not have
Taunt (and/or a ready to cast Stun when I'm playing my Paladin) at
the critical moment when the mob decides he wants to try something
from the back shelf of the buffet.  So if I see a high agro spell
stick, or if the Shaman kindly warns that he's casting slow as
a "heads up" to prep me for a possible resist, I'll be ready to
Taunt when it lands or gets resisted even if the mob doesn't agro
the caster (my Paladin of course just tosses stuns in freely at
the start of a fight when he's MT, funny how the "dummy" Warrior
has to play smarter than the caster hybrid in order to get the MT
job done, you could probably bot a Paladin MT and make it work
unless you needed to stun casters to interrupt, Paladin has to pay
pay a lot more attention in a support role).
