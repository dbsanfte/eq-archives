As someone developing an online RPG this is actually a topic quite
interesting to me. One of the things that I have come to regard as
part of a healthy economy in a simulation like EQ is nickel and
dimeing to death. See the truth about the real world is that
everything usefull depreciates. (except for collectables but that is
another issue) I don't care what your armor is made out of its only
going to take so much abuse before it breaks. Swords become dull. See
the thing is that nothing in EQ actually cost you anything. Food can
be foraged, and if you have it set up to forage everytime you walk
you'll be fed for life. Mobs drop loot, but chances are your killing
for XP and the loot is just a bonus. In real life i have to put gas in
my car, and pay my ISP, but in everquest there are no re-occuring
expenses. (aside from food and if you forage...)

My point is yes as long as there is an infinite supply of money their
needs to be an infinite consumption of money. And one huge consumption
like horses isn't going to cut it. Instead lots and lots of little
money sinks are better because they drain from the entire population
not just the top X%. Another option is to have a finite supply of
money. When players spend at NPC's or destroy objects the value lost
goes into a mob bank. when mobs drop loot a sum is deducted from that
mob bank. If the mob bank is empty, (because no one spent) then there
is no loot. Kind of harsh but it stops inflation dead. Combine finite
money with items that wear out (the value of broken armor goes into
the mob bank) then you have also effectively stoped hoarding. The
finaly bonus is that rich players have to work to stay rich. If the
rich player give any slack a poor player is right there ready to take
it.

Some might say that a finite wealth system is completely wrong and
unrealistic well look at it this way the earth is a finite space and
therfore has finite wealth. Its just so darned big we can see no end
and it appears infinite although it is not.
