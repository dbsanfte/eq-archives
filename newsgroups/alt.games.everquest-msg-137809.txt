Just wondering if it's okay to ask for price checks in this newsgroup.  I've
tried some websites but the problem I run into is all these items are no
drop except on FV where I play.  Because of this, often prices are not
listed for these items.  I've also tried online but most times people just
ignore you when you ask for a price check, even if you are polite.  :(

Thanks!

Rom
