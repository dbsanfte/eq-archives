The island is not KOS.  They will, however, assist if you are fighting one
of their buddies.  Zone up, turn until you are looking at the edge, then
follow the edge to the right a little ways until you get to a semi-clear
area.  Single pull there using a pacify/lull class.  We've never gotten an
add on this island - ever ( not counting the split mobs, of course ).

In general, this is my strat when I lead PoSky raids, assuming we're
skipping Djorn:

Port everyone up, buff up and start the slaughter on the winged bitches.
Save the Princess for last.  Loot just the rabbit foot for those that need
it.  I have everyone that needs keys still to join a channel and on person
deal with key distribution in that channel.  Kill the Princess, hand in the
keys.

Invis, go up to Azerack island, have someone on Pacify duty.  Kill azeracks,
mezzing the adds that get aggroed.  They fly pretty high and like pretty
much everthing in Sky, have higher than standard MR.  After you kill all the
roamers ( if you need that many keys ), kill the static Azerack, and then
kill the Protector.  Hand in key pieces to Sirran.

Go up to Gorgolosk island ( non-KOS ), run down to the port-pad and start
pulling.  Pull eyes first if you can because they dispell like crazy.  After
all eyes are dead, buff back up and keep killing until you have your key
pieces you need then kill the Gorgalosk in the building.  Get your keys.  If
you have people that need Epic pieces ( Necro feather? ) pull all the mobs
that can drop them.  Hell, pull them anyway and bank the droppable feathers
and give them to your Necro friends.

Head up to Pegasus ( SSoC ) island, and go to the open area.  Pacify pull
and kill.  I suggest camping your 2 best tanks and having them come back in
ST first, MT second to test my theory about the splits attacking the last
person that zones in.  Kill the beasts - all of them, and get all your SSoCs
for rangers that are present and for those that aren't ( MQ ).  When the
boss finally pops *yawn*, send in the Ranger, then kill it. Rez the Ranger,
get your keys, buff up, invis, and head up to Spiroc island.

This is a fun island.  Expect 3-9 mobs on the first pull.  Read the various
"guides" to figure out what to kill when if you are there for any reason
besides getting keys to Bee island.  I think we killed 9 Lords last time and
4 out of the last 5 dropped the Wingblade.  Grats 2 warriors in raid, 1 who
got logged in to loot, and 1 who will get the MQ if it works.  We also got 2
SK epic sword pieces from the lords.  AND, we got the ever-so-rare diamond.
Gratz Paladin in his impending 41% haste belt.  Kill the final Lord ( after
you kill the Guardian ) and turn in your key pieces to Sirran.

Buff up, invis, port up to the Bees, and run to the portal.  Pull the bees
however you want, but save the middle one for last if you need a lot of keys
because these things split and the middle one is the catalyst for the boss
mob.  Boss DTs, but isn't too bad.  Kill boss, get your keys, give Sirran
his trigger phrase if you want to go to the final island after drake, then
port up to Drake isle.

This is a fun isle, too.  I don't think Pacify works on -anything- up here,
and almost nothing is KOS, but they all assist and the drakes are flying by
each other so it's hard to single pull.  Kill all the drakes ( rezzing your
puller as needed ) and then move in to the sphinxes and spirits and get your
crowns, then kill Sister if you plan on moving up to the last isle.

I've never gone up to the last isle.  This is all from memory, so expect
some errors in it.
