I think I might have found something that will help some of you who may be
experiencing the same problems I am/had.

Symptoms: Crashing to desktop 2~? minutes into the game, invalid page faults
when resolution changes after logging into server.

Fix (maybe.. still testing): If you have more than 1 stick of RAM in your
computer try playing w/ only 1.

Possible mixing of manufactures of RAM has been rumored to cause adverse
effects with certain applications, EQ included. I've been having this
problem for about a month now and was ready to put together another system
before I heard about his fix. I had done all the fdisk, formatting, scan
disks, defrag, benchmarking, video card swapping, reloading of software I
could do and nothing helped. Figured it was a hardware problem. Pulled all
but one stick of 128 Mb of RAM out and the game runs fine. Was only in for 5
minutes but it was stable. Will be testing again tonight for much longer
than 5 minutes and will post results.
