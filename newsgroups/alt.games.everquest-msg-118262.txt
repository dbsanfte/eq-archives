  Yep. :)  I got my first piece of planar armor on Sunday, an Umbral
Platemail Bracer... on Hate, where Shadow Knight armor doesn't usually drop.
Apparently the haunted chests have a small chance of dropping planar armor
for any class.  An unexpected, but welcome surprise.  Like the boots for
you, for me the bracer wasn't a big step up, and there is better stuff
available, but it was a nice little milestone. :)
