It already is accepted usage amongst many millions of text-messaging
mobile-phone owners.

Indeed.

I remember the very first time I saw "lol" used in IRC. I took it to
be a pictorial-representation of someone throwing their arms in the
air (with the "o" being their head). It seemed perfectly reasonable
and in context with its usage ;)

One thing that still gets me is people who type a sentence and end it
with "lol". I don't think I can ever quite trust someone who laughs
out loud at their own words... certainly, if someone were to do that
in real life I'd expect their jacket to fasten at the back :)

Just voicing my opinion on the irrationality of it all.
