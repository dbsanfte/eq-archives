Not sure on the total stats of all officers, but there are seven members
in the council of elders in our guild. (The ones who actually run the
show.) Four of them are women. (RL women, not just female avatars.)

Oddly, in our regular hunting group, I have one wizard who is a male
playing a female character, and Tiru, who is a female playing a male
character. Watching the two of them get into some roleplaying
interaction and "flirting" between spawn cycles is rather....... mind
bending.
