Why?  It's not like you need to read what everyone is saying.  And does it
really bother you that much when you can't?  On Seventh Hammer, we have a
fairly good sized Japanese guild that, for some reason, insists on using say
around the bank.  It makes no difference to me what they are saying.  I
could care less.  Now, I do wish they would use groupsay, instead, but
that's to avoid the constant chatter.
