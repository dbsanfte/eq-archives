Frightened is more like it. After seeing their
new ideas for the game, cleric bash and some goofy hammer, I'm really
afraid of what POP will bring. Verant just doesn't seem to get what
the majority of the players want, less downtime and more to do, while
constantly catering to the uber minority for content most of us won't
even see with a character who is level 60.

I want more to do in a game like this, not more I CAN'T do.
