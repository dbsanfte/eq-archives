Fortunately, at 55, I was able to solo the spiders, albeit slowly.  Only
twice have I actually grouped in Velks, and that was with friends that came
in with me.  I have tried to LFG there, but it seems there is little
interest   At my killrate, I don't have much trouble locating the odd spider
to kill, the only problem I have is someone taking my pull before I get
aggro firmly established.
