No, not really.  Locations to pull mobs to are for very specific reasons..
positioning, to combat things such as AE spells, proximity agro, enrage on a
huge hitting mob, whilst giving enough space for the monks to comfortably
split

Splits generally take a few monks anyway... it shouldn't take an army of
monks to get a mob to camp though, least of all non-uber mobs like Tormax,
Statue

Remember this isn't monks who've played/raided a few months.. this is people
who have played a monk for 3 years, know their character inside out, and
also know mobs inside out

Of course we will adapt.. and pulling comes with a price (the big chance of
death), but if its nerfed beyond recognition then its no longer fun, nobody
plays to die all the time, and when its no longer fun, you no longer play.
Simple as that really.

Monks die on pulls every day.. even routine daily pulls can go wrong (dieing
to trash, e.g prots/vets in the arena, when your in an AoW level guild)..
new ST: having to kite red flurrying mobs around a room, having "fell to the
ground" when you just opened a room with 5 mobs in it, 4 HT you while the
5th is nuking you for 1.6k, even just 3 mobs that won't stop casting at
alternate times (so its impossible to FD), taking DT's, even on a successful
pull, getting stunned and beat into a pulp by a mob smacking you for 1100 a
pop (hi Statue, Idol, AoW) and flurrying

People talk like monks were like playing EQ in god mode..  funny that
probably no class dies more than monks, and its the monks who know mob
abilities, pathing, traps, spells, damage, assist code, positioning, warps
etc.. so they dont die because of low skill/noob mistakes

If its no longer fun, it won't be played (and monk is the only class that
fully interests me in EQ enough to keep me playing 24/7 as long as I have
done).. I guess thats the bottom line, really.
