You both have serious emotional problems.
What is it exactly you are wearing this pistol for?
Protection from aliens? Charleton Heston?
How many times have you had to use your gun and how many people have you
shot with it? (on purpose, that is).
Which militia is it that you belong to again?

I have enough trouble tolerating cops with guns much less "ordinary"
citizens.
