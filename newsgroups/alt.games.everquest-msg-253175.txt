Actually no, not in my experience.   Every time I have seen online things
like this (admittedly its rare, but I have seen it before), the reason most
commonly given is "I thought it would be funny.  Damn, you people have no
sense of humor."

We're not talking about someone here who actually tried to kill themselves,
or thought in some way that they were "killing" thier character.  The
examples you gave, while valid, don't really apply to this situation, IMO.
