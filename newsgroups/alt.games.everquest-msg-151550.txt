Oh yeah, like those are just falling off trees.  Lower level guilds suck.
They never go anywhere and when they do it's certain wipe-out and then half
the guild leaves.  They invite anyone into the guild to get numbers up and
then you get to sit around listening to a bunch of whining and stupid
questions.  The fewer higher level players (usually the ones that started
the guild) hang out together and the others are left to fend for themselves.
People know each other through guild-chat only, they rarely group together,
and when they do it's the same-ole exp zones as everyone else anyway.
Guilds are a high-end asset, at lower level they are nothing but an exra
chat channel.

Make another character that's in higher demand in groups and play it when
you feel like grouping, and the wizard when you feel like soloing.  A druid
is good, but I think at higher levels even druids are not as in demand as
some other classes.
