Its up to you... but... for me... I'd rather be in a guild that's 
raiding Mistmoore and having fun and looking forward to logging in, then 
in a guild that's raiding Time and not having fun, and not looking 
forward to logging in.

Ideally if you can find a guild that's raiding time and is fun to be a 
part of you've hit the jackpot... but that's a hard trick to make happen...
