The Caves in Surefall glades have always been (at least as long as I
remember) there, they just added the portal to the New Zone.
If they'd designed the caves to go with JP Forest I'd have thought they
would have actually made and tunnel zone similar to Warrens/Stonebrunt.
Incidently, The zone for Stonebrunt was there for sometime before SB went
live. If I recall it zoned you back to the Warrens entrance.
