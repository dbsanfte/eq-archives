    Well, get ready for the posts pointing out that he's right. Very right.

    You've played this game long enough to know that "common sense" and "EQ"
don't always mix, haven't you? Here, Biz, shove this fact in your "common
sense" pipe and smoke it:

    Turn on Autoattack, and you don't med while on horseback. MANUALLY swing
the weapon (hit your "melee attack" button when it ungreys), and unless you
manage to hit the melee attack button on the exact moment when a tick has
passed, guess what? You med on horseback.

    I haven't asked Dan to test whether he can hammer his melee attack key
and still get the med rate - that should be interesting. There's so many
bizarre factoids about horses ("Did you know.... a horse tanked Cazic Thule
once?") that someone should create a Horse FAQ.
