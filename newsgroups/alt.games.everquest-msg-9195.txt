    *Sits* *grovels about pesky flamers and their rants about people who
flame them*  *Ponders what Bizbee is up to*  *Contemplates his next move in
the news group game of flaming* *Ponders, why Brad McQuaid is so distant to
the EverQuest life lately and thinks of the nice and politeness of the
gentleman in his E-mails* *thinks about all the silly things he misspelled
and didn't care* *Giggles* *Remembers the world is full of assholes and most
of us live next door to one* *Realizes that his neighbor is a nice guy so he
must be the asshole* *Snickerz* *Ponders who and why the law suit collection
e-mail was sent to him.* *Ponders if some people realize law suits are not
about money but they are solved in dollar amounts - SOME TIMES*  *Thinks
about a hot shower and cold beer and a good reading of his favorite ethics
text book before bed.* *realizes he doesn't have any beer because he is
possibly an alcoholic who gets violent mood swings from drinking the next
day - hang over he guesses.* * Cough*  *thinks about his good buddy Bizer*
*Wishes he could see Bizer in a real time chat room so he could see the
great creativity of the Biz in real time.*  *Giggles*  *Ponders sanity and
the meaning of coherence.* *stands closes lap top and walks away*
