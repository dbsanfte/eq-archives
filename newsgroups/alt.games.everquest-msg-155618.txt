True.  But Brilliance or Insight only raises you 14 points of int or wis.  
KEI is 25.  When you're a warrior with max unbuffed wis 83, that extra 11 
points is going to save you some serious moola getting up your uber 
fletching.  And I've noticed that the novelty of a -melee- asking for KEI 
tends to tickle the generous nature of bored enchanters.  They know you 
aren't using it for a PL session, that's for sure. :)
