I'm on Tholuxe Paells.  I had a centi longsword just *poof* outa my inventory,
no patch had occured.  Someone here advised me to send an email using the SOE
website.  
I got a response the very next day saying that they could not locate one in my
inventory, ever, so sorry.  I sent them another email saying look again, I'd
had it for several weeks.  
The next day I got an e-mail saying it would be on my character when I logged
her back in.
It was :)
