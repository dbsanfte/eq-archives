Food, Stat giving if available, Iron rations if not
Drink, stat giving if available 
3 or 4 stacks of each

Bandages, 4 stacks  (Rarely used)

Shiny Brass Idol

Felhammer

Workmans Mallet (for emergency Gates)

Arrows, when I remember

100pp (for Donations)

Blood of the Wolf Potion  for emergency SoWs

My Containers are;

1x Rallic Pack
1x Evil Eye Bag
1x Tiny Coin Purse
2x Hand Made Backpaks
1x Tailored Quiver
1x Fletching Kit
1x Deluxe Tailoring Kit

I really need to drop the Tailoring Kit as the Rallic Pack will hold Giant 
Sized Objects and I really like to have an empty inventory slot.

That's about it for my packs...I had more junk but I had to ditched it to 
save weight  when I dropped my Velium Fire Emerald Rings.

My Bank, however, contains spare armour (full suit of Guardian with SSB) 
spare weapons,  Vehement Sword and a couple of mid level 1hders and SoW 
potions for CR's

As well as other junk that may or not be for quests and I've never checked 
(lots of the lesser Twilight Drops that I really should destroy or sell)
