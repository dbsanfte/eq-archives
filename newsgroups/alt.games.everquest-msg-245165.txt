Same random lockups for me, too.  And at times, there would be a minute pause
where I can move the mouse, but not right-click look around, or click on
anything.  Then everything will go back to normal.  And standard people/mobs in
the ground, etc. P4 3.2 Ghz, 1 GB RAM, GeForce FX 5900.  Happened since the last
patch.  At first was using the October 3rd WHQL drivers, then Sunday downloaded
the April 1st WHQL.  Still happening.  Also Win XP Pro and SB Aud 2 if that
matters.
