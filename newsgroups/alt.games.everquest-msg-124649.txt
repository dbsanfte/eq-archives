You should be able to get by (barely) with
366MHz Celeron
192MB of Ram
Geforce2 MX
(This used to be my setup so I know it will work. Just be sure to turn 
everything possible off. I noticed no major problems using the texture 
upgrade.)

It won't be fun if you go to any of the Luclin zones, especially any of the 
cities. It's not too bad if you pull the clipping plane all the way in. 
Performance will be pretty bad otherwise. On the old world you won't notice 
any problems at all. If you just want to login and stand around being a 
merchant or mule on the second computer this would meet your needs with not 
much expense.
