Well, I suppose the person was just trying to scrape up some cash
after having to spend 4-5+ pp each on some of the level 9 or 14 spells
(shaman or druid).  But personally if someone else in the zone is /ooc
"SOWing for donations", I won't then start offering free SOWs; I'll
just let the other player give their SOWs to whoever is willing to
donate so I won't cut into his/her "business".  (I even saw one player
charging 5 gold for Spirit of Bear, stamina buff)

But I've actually found that one sometimes makes more money by just
answering an /ooc request for a SOW (one of my SOWing characters got
30 pp from a higher level player /ooc'ing for a SOW).  

Generally if I play a SOWing character I won't ask for donations but I
won't turn them down either, unless either I do a drive-by SOW (one
shouldn't have to pay for something they didn't ask for) or for
somebody doing a CR who stopped at the bank to get money to donate for
a SOW (CRs are always free).
