That's a case by case thing. For a lot of dungeons, we don't go into
certain camps until we get one of the guild druids into our group.
Reason? Because they have port/evac.  Yes, a damage shield is nice, but
for general buffing I'd take a shammy for that slot any day. But if the
shit hits the fan, and we have to get out NOW, or if it's a one way
dungeon where we're going to have to crawl through hell to get to the
exit when we're done, I'll take the porter every time for just that
reason. For a smallish, low fifties group, Seb guards can be a pain in
the ass to fight your way out from. The Hole beyond the ledge is another
great example. 

I'm not saying that the Druid doesn't add a lot of value once she's in
the group in addition to that. The skins, DS, other buffs, etc. are very
nice and they can nuke towards the end as well. But if I didn't need the
evac capability, depending on the rest of the group makeup, I'd probably
be eyeing a shammy, a wizard, or another melee damage dealer for that
slot.
