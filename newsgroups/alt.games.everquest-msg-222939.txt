About a week after Legends opened. The most famous example was the
staff the Emporer of Ssrae dropped originally that summoned up the final
piece needed for a Vex Thall key. There was quite a business in selling
those cross server until SOE changed the way these fragments were
obtained to a less exploitable drop. Other things that were big sellers
are the AOW monk legs, and Sceptres of Disruption which were unavailable
on servers where the Sleeper had been awakened.

SOE has reportedly clamped down a bit on this, as I've heard stories of
people being denied return to their old servers with high ticket items
as much as a year ago now.
