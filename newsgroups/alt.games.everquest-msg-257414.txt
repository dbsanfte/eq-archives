The imagination of what Horizons sounds like makes it seem a shame, of
course I have never played it, and know little about it, but it did sound
like it could of been good.  You could be a dragon, I think this is what
makes me think that way (ya  I like dragons, even if what I think of  a
dragon are not 'proper' dragons).

Except all I have heard is the crafting system is good, and the rest of the
game sucks (nothing specific, mainly long travel times, few mobs....).
