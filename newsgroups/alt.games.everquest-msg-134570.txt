In which case you're SOL.  The only difference between now and, say,
50 years ago was that back then anti-discrimination was such a vague
legal concept that no one had a chance at justice when it happened.
Now many people do.     Meanwhile anyone who feels another category
needs to be added should get off their butts and do something about
it.  I have.

PS-- I have it from a good source- a Member or Parliament- that a
phone call or letter to your elected representative does indeed get
attention.  No guarantee that you'll get what you want, but someone
will take note of it.  They figure that for every letter written there
are hundreds of people voicing the same opinion.

In this case mostly the law per se, as opposed to application.

> Then let's make the LAW reflect the way it SHOULD be...

Pointless exercise.  The status quo for decades was implied or
explicit equality with no mention of specific types of discrimination,
and plenty of people suffered.  It took years of arguments in court
before it was decided in Canada that sexual oriention was something
which should be included under "do not discriminate".  That's what you
get with your generic law-- everyone has to seek out a court ruling
that what they experienced was indeed "wrong", and others will say
"no, its ok, its not descrimination".  You end up with a body of
precedent describing what forms of discrimination are condemned....
pretty much the same as having laws banning some forms of
descrimination, but with less force and less clarity.   Some people
are still left out in the cold, because no ruling has been made on
their type of case and they do not have the resources to take
something through the court system.

So what different now?   If the Charter sais "you may not discriminate
for any reason, including but not limited to [list]" , what difference
does it make that sexual orientation is part of the list?  Or that
race, gender, religion, etc. are part of that list?   Here are two
examples from recent news events:

1) A gay teen wants to take his boyfriend to the prom.  His school
says no, they are a Catholic school.   Yikes, this sounds like the
making of a long and difficult court process as freedom of religion is
viewed against personal rights.  Expect this to take years in court,
at which point it becomes moot, the prom is long over.  In 2002,
however, the judged found it a very simple decision.   There could be
no debate on "is this discrimination"- the Charter of Human Rights
says it is.  The school was not a private school but a publicly funded
school, so it was bound to follow the Charter by three different legal
arguments.  Simple case, took less than one month in court, IIRC.
Without explicit statements this case would still be in court debating
whether or not this was discrimination.  Then they would debate if
this discrimination was justified.  Then they would get around to the
religious freedom issues.

2) An Ontario judge recently ruled that limiting marriage to
opposite-gender couples is unconstitutional and gave the goverment 2
years to rectify the situation.  Again, based on the explicit ban on
discrimantion based on sexual orientation, this was a relatively fast
and simple decision.  It may well be appealed, and the governement may
make an argument that this is a "special case" in which discrimination
is ok (courts have accepted that before), but the first steps of the
case happened very quickly and simply.
(NOTE:  This is a bit of a legal grey area: provinces register
marriages but marriage laws are federal; a provincial court made a
ruling regarding federal laws; the province is not appealing, but the
feds have not commented yet... you get the picture)

No, they don't.  There are always exeptions.

> How can there be equality under the law if there are exceptions??

This isn't math class, equality is a very hard to define concept, and
much harder to enforce.  Let me be clear here:  while there are
exceptions- laws that promote INequality- I do not think specific
anti-discrimination laws promote inequality.  These laws are not
exeptions, they are only listing specific cases so everyone is clear
on what's what.

A law like the one you said Oregon had is an "exception"- a law which
does not provide protection for everyone.  Has the law said "no
discrimination based on sexual orientiation" then that is merely a
specific case, it in no way lessens the overall message that
discrimination is wrong.  In fact, it strengthens it- both by the very
statement is makes and by making it possible for those who are
discriminated against to get justice.

Your point is that every person should have to spend thousands of
dollars and years in court establishing on a case-by-case basis that
they have been wronged?   You think the everage Joe can afford that,
both financially and personally, all without knowing that the court
will agree with him?

No, wrong emphasis, EVERYONE can use them.  There are some types of
discrimination for which the legal argument is greatly simplified
because of an explicit statement, that is all.  If that is the case
for you, then you need to argue based on the generic statement and/or
precedent.


> Let's discuss the issues and not any one person participating, K?

Hey, I'm trying to treat you with respect but you are the type of
person who makes my life harder, so be realistic here.  YOU and YOUR
opinions about what you claim are "special rights" are what I have
been fighting against my entire adult life.  The phrases are used by
people- often people completely ignorant of the reality of the
situation- but people who influence the politicians who make decisions
which we all have to live with.

I'll grant that you seem to have thought this through a little bit,
and aren't just another idiot who has jumped on the bandwagon, but get
real here.  What you are promoting may work in the future, but today
your views are hurting people who need these laws in place.

No.   Not sure where you got that.

And such as law exists in Canada and many places, and such a case is
possible to win, but you are looking at a hard and long court battle
to prove the point.

And if no categories exist, everyone is SOL, as was the case in the
past.  Now a great many people enjoy a "short-cut to justice".  In
some cases the very existence of the law prevents the discrimination
from taking place.  In time more categories may be added if they are
needed, nothing wrong with that.   After thousands of cases go through
the courts on the same topic, its time to stop being stupid about it!

Not trying to bash your local view, just wanted to point out the risks
of judging all anti-discrimination laws based on *any* specific
location or case.  Although I really don't envy the state-by-state
system you guys have!   What a nightmare...
