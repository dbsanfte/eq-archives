We've had luck camping the revs near the Maestro.  It takes a good 5-6 hours
solid camping to get any essence to drop though, and at that I think weve
been lucky. It appears to be an absurdly rare drop. Ive also heard that it
ONLY drops off of the Female Vamp models, FWIW, but I Could be dead wrong on
that.

Good luck to you in any event!!
