Are you in a guild? Guilds are the best way of combating "Only hunt in
pickup zone" syndrome. Once you have a few people of your level that you are
in regular contact with, you can grab a few friends and go to any zone you
want, chances are they will be in the same boat as you and will be only too
happy to get out of Overthere or wherever.

At your level, Mistmoore is great fun, good xp and reasonable loot.
Crystal Caverns in EW is good xp and great loot too and the rygorr fort is
nice xp and good loot, once you bring a group.

SolA, Lower Guk and Tower of Frozen Shadow are all good too, but again, they
are all bring your own group.

Check out the Allakhazams zone level chart for ideas.
