Oh, pre-5 I'm sure.  Within 2 weeks of joining I know (my first long-term
character was born on 4/1/99...I joined around 3/24/99).

That question specifically? No.  I'm talking about just general questions.
Sounds like you didn't like to ask questions in /ooc.

Nektulos is a tough newbie zone.  Bind point out of sight of the guards, no
path to Neriak, confusing paths overall, red critters aggroing newbies if
you take one step too many.
Hmmm, sorta sounds like GFay. :)

You had 10p to waste on a port at level 7??  When I was in Oasis around
level 16 with my druid (4 months into the game) Demoness on The Rathe
auctioned for a SoW.  I ran to her, cast it, and she gave me 10p.  This was
more than 10x what I had in the bank at the time, and probably EQUALED the
maximum amount of money ANY of my characters (about 4 long-term by that
time) had at any time.   Wow, to me that was a lot of money.
