Or, rather, the proof positive that God DID exist, which meant he
didn't, which...er...

*ahem*  (It's one of my favorite bits from The Book. :)

The Babel fish... is small, yellow and leechlike, and probably the
oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on the brainwave energy received
not from its own carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all
unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish
itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic
matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve
signals picked up from the speech centers of the brain which has
supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a
Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you
in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode
the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish.

Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so
mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some
thinkers have chosen to see it as a final and clinching proof of the
non-existence of God. The argument goes something like this:

"I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and
without faith I am nothing."

"But," says Man, "the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could
not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by
your own arguments, you don't. QED."

"Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes
in a puff of logic.

"Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that
black is white and gets himself killed at the next zebra crossing.
