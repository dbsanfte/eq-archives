This is where gear matters most to a cleric, though, we can actually
have the AC and HP to stand there and take a beating while
channeling that root (or my favorite Flash of Light)... when on
a CR be careful to remember that you are suddenly as vulnerable
to a beating as that chanter or druid you've been laughing at.

I don't hotkey "mob beating on me" and in fact its rare I even
mention it when one is.  Take care of it myself or rely on the
chanter to get around to it on her own time... I'd FAR rather
have the mob beat on me than on the mezzer.

I recall going in to seb, dying, going back in on CR, and dinging
before getting to my body.  We did have to be sure to let
me med to full between fights due to the shallowness of my
mana pool, but that medding didn't take long... pool only
1/3rd as deep sure it empties fast but it fills up fast too.
