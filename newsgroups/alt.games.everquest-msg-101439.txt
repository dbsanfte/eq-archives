Well if your KOS... you will not be good to bind.. because the
SoulBinder is behind the City Gate which you need a key for, or
another player with a key. (would really suck to be bound in there and
die with no way back to corpse)

Presently my wife is trying to build faction there so she can sell..
Dwarf Warrior.. and we have killed numerous gnolls.. and she is still
Dubious..

Luck to you... the warrens is a really fun zone, IMHO
