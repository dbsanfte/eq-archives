This is true.  However, unless you are a hybrid a successful cast will
reset your melee timer as if you had just made an attack.  So, for
instance, a Paladin can get a fast-cast stun off between swings of his
2-hander (if he times it right), but a Druid won't get a melee attack
in after a cast until his melee delay has passed unless his cast was
interrupted.

Your understanding is correct for hybrid spellcasting.
