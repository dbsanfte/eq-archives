If the mob runs there after you have beaten it, in otherwords it is fleeing
the combat volunterily, then it is not an exploit it is verants problem, the
mob was running anyway, by it's own choice not your fault where they run to
and you would have all but killed it anyway.

BUT...If you force them there by using fear, knowing they will go no further
(similar to the steps outside the SkyFire zone in OT) then you ARE using an
exploit and can expect at least a warning for doing so.
The method of using it as crowd control, ie you fear the extra mobs and kill
them when they return is a grey area. Again, it is not your fault where they
run to, they run that's good enough. The possible exploit is you know they
only run so far so reducing the chance for them returning with any friends
but you have no control when they will break fear you just know they will
and they'll return, you just have to hope you are ready for them when they
do. I'd call it good tactics, it's by no means fail safe (not by a long
shot) but it may just pay off in light of having no enchanter.

That's my opinion (I'm no GM) based on what I've seen and heard while
playing the game. If Verant think there is a chance for an exploit here they
will hide a GM or Guide in the zone, so be careful.
