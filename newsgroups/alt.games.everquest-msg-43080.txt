I'm a 30th Druid and this is GREAT advice. Nothing pisses me off more than
to be camping a spawn with my group, be the only healer (meaning the group
cannot go forward until my mana is high enough) and have someone walk up and
say "Mullo SoW me". Like I'm some kinda automatic SoW machine. If they are
at all kind about it and ask respectfully I usually SoW them (I mean its not
like it takes 200 mana to cast it). I have even had people ask for SoW heals
and buffs. You have to remember, the reason YOU want a SoW and a Heal is so
you can get off your butt and play the game. The Reason I don't want to give
them to you is because it means I have to spend more time on my butt not
playing the game! As this poster said, if you are respectful and realize
that it really DOES cost me something (time wasted, the most precious
commodity in the game) to SoW, Port, Heal and Buff you, then I just might do
it.

Having said this, I almost always would spend 100% of my mana to rescue
someone, as long as there is NO WAY they knew I was coming in to do it. I've
seen LOTS of people in oasis drag their Mob that they know they can't beat
to the dock and sit there yelling heal please (and get the mob to 50% and
then /yell for help) I've seen the same person do this over and over,
probably getting great XP, to the detriment of everyone else sitting there.
My rule is I save you once, if you didn't learn your lesson... then sorry.
