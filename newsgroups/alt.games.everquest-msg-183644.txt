Not to hijack the thread, but this is exactly why I've never given a shit
about people and their epics.

Epics are formula.  Do this, do that, hand the product to this other NPC,
have a big fight, yada yada.  Insert tab A into slot B and you end up with a
click stick.

It's like getting all worked over having the ability to follow the
directions in a cookbook and bake a cake.

If that's your thing, great.  I'm happy for you.  I've helped in the hunts
for many, many guildies who needed to kill VSR, Fay, the critter in Lake
Rathe who's name escapes me atm, or any number of mobs for their epics.  I'm
always happy to help if it makes a guildie's day.

But as for myself, I'm far more impressed by watching a talented chanter
solo charm kite the Rygorr fort than I am by seeing a druid in the Nexus
with a leafblower.
