That's actually gonna be about your average solo xp rate at level 38.
When my BST was that level, I think he was in Tenebrous near Katta
killing the wolves. Might have still been in Dreadlands, hunting in

BSTs aren't there for tanking in groups. They're sick DPS. I've seen
mostly BST groups tear through hard LDON adventures like they were
nothing....
