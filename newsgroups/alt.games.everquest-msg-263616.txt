Wrong.   The interface between modules is the easiest
(and most usual) place to have errors.   Generally speaking,
they'd have someone in charge of housing, someone in
charge of the bazaar, etc.   The problem described is as
simple as having the person in charge of the bazaar release
THEIR code and forgetting - since they didn't write it - to
release the (minor) part of the housing code which links the
two parts.

The design could be right, the code could even be right -- the
problem could simply be one of release management.   In MY
experience that's one of the simplest and most common reasons
for errors being found in user testing that aren't seen during
integration testing, right up there with "why is the user doing
this task in "B, A, C" and not "A, B, C" order?"
