How the hell can Verant justify changing the date, year, month or
whatever whenever they feel like it? That's just so damn unrealistic!

I mean, for example, how on EARTH would the ancient egyptians build
their pyramids if they didn't know the year was 500BC so they could
write it down everywhere, if people changed the date on them? And that
Mr. Gregorian did something about the dates, but ignore that.
