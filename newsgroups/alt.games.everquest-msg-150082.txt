if you changed your password this weekend, it may not have taken.  Might 
have to do it again.  Also, I tried to change my EQ login password on 
the website but it wouldn't let me complete the webforms, gave me an 
error and when I emailed about it they wanted my CDkey and a bunch of 
other info before they would change the password, may have to do that too.
