 After waiting many hours to play Saturday, I was anxious and assuming that
maybe they finally fixed the Fear bug. You know, the bug that effectivly
sends the Mob clear across the zone when you cast "Fear Spells" on it.

 To my dismay, it still exist like it has for a long time. Have no idea what
they fixed.

 Any word on fixing this that anyone has heard of ?

 Pretty sad when I spend all that time on a Wurm just to see someone else
get the kill, and the exp.
