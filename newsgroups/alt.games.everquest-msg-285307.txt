When i reinstalled EQ1 today in anticipation of reactivating it next
weekend i got a surprise. i was bored and decided to try to log in,
even though the accounts inactive. To my surprise i was able to log
in! Is this because of the free demo they are offering everyone else?
Also because this is a full account and if this is because of the
demo, will i be stuck at level 10 with the new char i decided to roll
up?
I tried to find my old alt but its been so long i think they deleted
it. I tried looking around the servers but could not find him. :(
