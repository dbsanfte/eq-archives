Having given EQ2 a second try last month (and found that they've 
incorporated a lot of what I like about WoW into EQ2 ... man, I love 
competition), just for grins I signed up for the All Access Pass this month. 
Fired up my EQL account today for the first time in about 6 months.  I 
noticed a few things right off the bat:

1) My old server (Cazic Thule) has apparently been merged with Brell.  I see 
several folks running around with the "of Brell") suffix on their names.

2) There's now a counter for gems on the top right portion of my inventory 
screen.  I have no clue what this is for.  Anyone?

3) You can get directly to the bazaar from the PoK nowadays .. that's handy.

4) The "Return Home" button makes it much more likely that I'll see how far 
into a dungeon I can crawl by myself, something I always loved to do but 
hesitated to do with a non-gate class.

So, since there's still only 50 folks in the PoK, I started a task with my 
40 cleric.  Performed the first two parts, no problem .. run to the small 
raptor island in Tim Deep, then run to the Skyfire entrance in OT.  Then I 
got the third part ... find some NPC in FV.  Grab the stone, hit the secret 
tunnel, pop into the outpost.

Hey, waitadamnminute ... that looks like a Dark Elf ... what the hell?

Dragoon Whatshisname lights your ass up for a buttload of damage.

Loading, please wait .....

Logged, and called up my chanter.  Make the same run, became a DE, and ran 
around the outpost.  No one there but Dragoons and Cliff Golems .. no 
vendors, no bankers ... nothing.

Hmmmmm.   Ooooooooo-kay.  Search the story journal ... if it's there, I 
missed it.

Googled on 'Firiona Vie Dragoon' ... 4 hits, none relevant.

Could anyone spare the time to give the Reader's Digest condensed version of 
what happened?

TIA,
Crash
