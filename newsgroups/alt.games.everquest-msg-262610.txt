...which is why so many politicians were lamenting his existing and
building program before Bush took office, and before Bush even
mentioned a war in Iraq.  Clinton launch missiles at Iraq to stop its
WMD programs, because of what Bush said in 2003.

You must have misread my question.  Put yourself in his place shortly
before the US invasion.  Pretend you are him, you have (highly
valuable) WMD, the US is about to invade and overthrow you and will
seize any WMD it finds.  What do you do?  Leave them laying around to
be seized and to give your enemy justification for invasion?  Or sell
them and reap some nice profits, or barter with them for safe passage,
or even *give them away* to nations or groups that would at least use
them to spite the country that is about to take away your country from
you?  You think it more likely Hussein would just leave them for us in
his basement or what?

It should be obvious unless you want to avoid the question.

I don't know.  What constitutes "outrageous" as far as loss of life is
concerned?

Its very easy for you to pretend that I discounted there lives because
that allows you to avoid my point.  They are honorable men and women
who sacrificed their lives for their country and will never be
forgotten in my heart.  Go fuck yourself if you think you can paint me
as someone who thinks those lives meant nothing.  I take that as a
personal insult.

Back to the point you avoided: what is "outrageous"?

No, those goals do not include getting Americans and Iraqis killed. 
Do you have a point or is spin all that you have?

North Korea admitted that it secretly restarted its nuclear program. 
Beginning as early as 1996, it was trading long-range missile
technology for Pakistani uranium enrichment technology.  The Clinton
Administration learned of this in the late '90s and a Department of
Energy report cited evidence of the North Korea-Pakastan agreement in
1999.  Kim Chong-il was deceiving the world all along but it wasn't
until the Bush administration confronted North Korea with evidence of
proliferation that North Korea admitted to its program and revealed
that it possessed nuclear weapons.  We avoided confrontation and
counted on good will to prevent proliferation.  That didnt work, now
did it?

How did Bush's incompetence allow North Korea to continue developing
nuclear weapons during the Clinton Administration?  This is kinda like
how Bush "created" the 9/11 attacks by pissing off the Muslim
world...when in fact the attack was being planned for several years
during the Clinton administration.

Are you going to list those other countries you referred to or not?

Good, now that you realize what it would take to appease them, maybe
you will realize that they cannot be appeased.

By the end of his term the deficit (which had also ballooned under
Carter with historically astronomical interest rates attached) was
dropping and real debt coming under control.  It was the massive
recession created in large part by Paul Volker that created a massive
drop in revenues and led to years of deficits.

No answer to my question?
