I skilled up on Wu's for the Coldain Prayer Shawl quests (as doubtless a lot
of other people are doing). Most of it I dumped on full vendors or sold at
cost to guildies, but the few bits I actually sold using /auction went for
about 15pp per AC+AGI. I sold 6 or 7 tunics for 175pp each without too much
trouble. A lockjaw vest may be 1/10th the price, it's also 15 times the
weight (although a Foreman's Tunic is weight zero I believe). The whole
point of Wu's is that it weighs very little.

The cost of a trade skilled item is only slightly related to how much the
ingredients for the item cost, but much more related as to how difficult it
is to get to the skill level necessary (tailoring is a pain due to the
number of dropped components required), how long it takes to get the
components (making 100 Heady Kiola is a major pain in the ass and source of
RSI :), spider silks are now getting pretty pricey, and you need to find a
chanter for the mana vials), and what it's actually worth (i.e. are the
items better than a comparable mob-dropped piece).

After all, people don't seem adverse to paying 50-100pp for a tailored item
that can cost less than 1pp to make (a backpack), so why is the price of
Wu's suddenly supposed to be no more than cost in materials? Would you
expect a jeweller to sell golden black sapphire ear-rings at 200pp because
you can very rarely find black sapphires on a vendor?

Of course, for the pieces which have better (and easily available)
mob-dropped equivalents the prices will come down, but the rest of them seem
pretty reasonable to me. They are worth whatever people are willing to pay
for them. And inevitably the sudden influx of master tailors, bakers,
brewers, jewellers, smiths, potters and fletchers caused by the Coldain
Prayer Shawl quests is likely to lower the average price of trade skill
items somewhat - a somewhat strange decision by Verant since they like to
promote player inter-dependence, but that's a separate rant.
