Ok. Granted, they do seem to have dropped the ball. How exactly do you 
want to be compensated for your inconvenience? Now, when they do that 
though, they'll also need to compensate others for other similar 
inconveniences from other nerfings or game changes. 

At some point they'll just say screw it and the introduction of new or 
dynamic content that everyone likes to see will be reduced to a barely 
perceptible trickle to insure against the massive CS loads they might 
cause under that sort of policy. 

All that said, I do sympathize with anyone who camped those items for so 
long. Well, sorta sympathize, anyway. I still can't see camping anything 
for a day and a half, and don't think that should be required for 
*anything*.
