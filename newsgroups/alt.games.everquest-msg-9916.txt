I believe (could be wrong) that voice graft has been taken out as a spell.
I know SK's don't get it, but not sure if necros get it anymore.  There are
still some items that will allow you to do voice graft.

There was a PC on the docks in Kunark waiting for the boat the other day.
He hid under the water while his pet stood at the docks and threatened to
kill anyone who stepped on the docks.  Not sure how many people he scared
off, but I guess it beats just sitting around waiting, waiting, waiting for
the boat.
