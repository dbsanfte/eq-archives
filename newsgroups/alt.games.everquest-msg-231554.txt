I had a similar close encounter whilst brush cutting on our property. We use
full face sheilds and trench coats as it is pretty rough terrain, anyway we
are using nylon "fishing line" standard whipper snipper sttachments this day
and I run out of nylon cord. So - stop, lift the faceshield and spend about
5 minutes threading more nylon cord through. Quick check - everything is
fine so flip down my face sheild...

...to find myself staring face to face with the biggest damn huntsmen spider
I have ever seen in my life which was mere millimetres away on the INSIDE of
my facesheild. Now huntsmen are not dangerous, but they are big (at least
10cm accross), bulky and hairy. This particular combinations makes for one
intimidating looking spider...

... needless to say I was out of my brush cutter harness, trench coat and
facesheild of the damned in about 0.3 seonds flat doing and peculiar
flailing version of the Riverdance, making sure nothing else had made it's
way onto my personage and subconsciously patting myself down to ensure all
my limbs and extremities were still present and accounted for.
