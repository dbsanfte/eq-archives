Me the idiot? Where did I mention that they couldn't download
newsreaders? I was talking about installation rights in case you
already forgot. And it was merely one of the many examples why
bridges/gateways can be useful.

And the subject at hand here is me saying hello to the newsgroup while
you seem to prefer the topic whether we need the feature on our board
or not. If it was a discussion we really wouldn't need your input and
opinion on that matter.
