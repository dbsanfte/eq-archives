So, you would go out of your way to be unfair?  How about unreasonable?
Illegal (only one step away from unfair)?  Immoral?

: And all deserve to be there.

All can be, but it is not an inalienable right.  Those that seek to impinge
upon the pleasure of others in, what is supposed to be a game do not deserve
anything other than to be remobed from the equation.

You are kidding, right?  Or are you too stupid to see a difference between
hatred of a race for no reason other than race and the dislike of people
that think it is their right to take away from my leisure time.  Since when
can a legitamate grudge be compared to racism.  By having a dislike of
people that want to make a business out of a game that I want to play for
pleasure that somehow makes me the equivellant of a racist?  You are
deluded.

You probably aren't a moron either.  Oh wait.  Yes, you are.

You seem to have the illusion that EQ is a game to win or lose.  So, when
you have achieved level 65 and all your AAs are done, you will quit?  Please
tell me it's so.
