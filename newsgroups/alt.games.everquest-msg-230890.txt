If, and only if, it has a real and noticabale effect on those procs.

It's 180+ hit points at level 60.  How much do you pay for a piece of gear
that has 180 hp on it?

Some people swear by it.

It has not been for me.

There are what, 6 weapon skills.   Exactly how much of a slacker were you
that you needed to catch up more than one, ever?

You're really going to argue that you should make the unaterable choice of
placing your initial points into dexterity, just so you can cut down what,
10 percent? of a three hour annoyance that occurs once in a few years of
playing?

No matter what class you are, extra hit points will save your ass much more
often than dexterity will reduce the annoyance of having to pick up a skill
that you were lazy about.

True enough.   Meaningless, since I've yet to run into any situation in the
game where I was certain that I would not take damage on my character, save
perhaps a few minutes shopping in the bazaar... but true enough.

Heh.  What game have you been playing?

/boggle.

Turn this into... this is *all about* which stat is more important.  You're
giving advice on where you should choose to purchase with your starting
points.   That implys taking a look at all of the possible selections, and
making the choices and choosing which one will help you the most.

If you're not making any comparison, then by that reasoning, "You should
spend all your starting points on charisma.   Charsima lowers vendor prices,
and every character purchases some items from vendors."  also is "good"
advice.

Both will help you.  If you're not going to compare the two, what is the
point of this whole thread?

Again, I have to wonder what game you've been playing.   I made an effort to
max stamina on my gear, and bothered little with dexterity.   I'll give you
three guesses as to which one got maxed first. (and the first two guesses
don't count.)
