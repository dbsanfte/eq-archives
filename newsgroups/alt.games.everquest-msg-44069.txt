You soloed a lvl 20 mob through lvl 27? And you think that was "good
xp"? Man...

Mm, lessee... I root/rotted in LOIO all the way to 29. From there, I
foot/rotted and fear kited animals in East Wastes and Iceclad. A good
chunk of 30 was spent on the Crazed Goblins in Butcherblock Mts, and
back and forth between there and EW/IC to 34. 34-36 have been spent
quad kiting Ulthorks, Tizmaks, Walruses, Drakkel Dires, and Cougars in
IC/EW/Great Divide ( Depending on whether the spot I want is
overcamped ).
