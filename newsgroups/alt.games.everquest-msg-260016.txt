I have been involved in those about a dozen times, they are great fun.

I was only in on the front end (there during setup) twice, most raids 
don't mind if you drop in and start nuking when it's already in 
progress, as long as you know what not to do. On the setup end, one was 
'uberguild's day off open ring raid', the other was for my own guild. 
The second failed horribly.
