There is not even the tiniest sliver of a remote possibility that this 
sleazeball was in the right. He used deceit to take advantage of another. 
Based solely on the facts as you've presented them here, in the absence 
of any explanation better than "he did nothing wrong", either he or I 
would be out of that guild by the end of that evening. Their attitude in 
that case would only prove to be obviously inconsistent with my own.

I'm getting pissed off just thinking about it. >_<
