I bought (about 3 months ago) a Dell Dimension 8200 - 2.66 Ghx, XP
Pro, 1GB RDRAM, 120GB HDD, 128MB GeForce4 video card.  It's a fine
machine and the first time I played EQ it was like a new game.  I was
able to ramp up the resolution from 800*600 to 1024*768 (it plays at
higher res. too but the text is too small!) and things just worked so
smoothly.  No more jitters running through FV with the trees, all the
Luclin zones were smooth-flowing (as opposed to slideshows). 
(Previous machine was a P2-450 with 512 ram).  No more slideshows on
raids, either.  Zoning is much faster as is the inital loadup.  Need I
go on? :)

Dealing with Dell, here in Ireland, was relatively trouble free.  They
say that their best prices are on the web, but if you go to the web,
spec up a machine and get a quote for it, THEN ring a sales person
with the spec and get a quote from them for that spec.  You should be
able to beat them down to less than the web-based price (and probably
they will throw in an extended warranty for free).  I have no problem
buying stuff over the web, but when it's a complicated piece of kit
with lots of components I'd rather speak to a human to clarify a few
things than just make selections from dropdowns, key in my CC details
and wait...
