In Qeynos, it depends on your level.  Up to level 19, you get the writs 
from an apprentice just inside the mage tower in South Qeynos, from Guard 
Williamson in front of the castle in North Qeynos, from a halfling next to 
a tree near the temple of life entry area in North Qeynos, and from 
Wanderer Greencoat (I think that's the name) at the base of the lift in 
Eldar Grove.  Level 20-24 (and maybe higher), you get them from 4 other 
NPCs that are not far from the 4 for lower levels.  If you talk to the 4 I 
mentioned above, they will tell you who to get them from.  As I recall, one 
is inside the mage tower, take the portal next to the apprentice.  One is 
outside the Temple of Life, but in the area where the temple is.  One is 
next to the castle door, and the last one is up in the tree house (take the 
lift next to Greencoat).
