As long as you don't switch all the luclin models on you should be fine.

With all models turned on and textures set high EQ & W2K has a 850MB
footprint on my system. Drom the textures down and turn off the luclin
models and it's 450MB footprint.

As long as you are not using swap file then performance should be decent.
