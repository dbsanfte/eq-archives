	Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood.  These days unless we're in someplace
like riftseekers I can always stand up and (try to) hit the mobs, or
have nukes resisted, or have stuns not take effect :-) if I'm bored.  What
I'm looking for is a way to feel like I'm _doing_ something.

	What I've hit on is duoing with a chanter in Veksar.  The mobs
here aren't trivial but they're not that tough.  I tank (because it's a
little more DPS and more fun than just healing the pet), he charms and
slows and nukes.  We've also done this in Acrylia.  It's nice because
niether of us can conveniently solo here (his pet dies too fast and I take
a full mana bar to kill anything) but together we can have a little fun
and even get some loot.
