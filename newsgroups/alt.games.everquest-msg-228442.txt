> So finally to the question. How could I have held the aggro better.

Dont rely on weapons / taunt for aggro, you are a ranger, not a warrior.

Tank with a high damage 2HS to lower ripostes.

Use all your self damage shields / atk buffs.

To hold aggro over ANYTHING (I mean the shaman being able to pull on
incoming without aggro etc), /assist the puller, and use your level 9
tangling weeds, this gives very good aggro and has a very fast cast time.
Follow this up with level 9 flame lick (dot + ac debuff), and aggro will be
yours, add in a regular snare to stop it running, maybe adding another flame
lick afterwards to ensure aggro.

I still use those spells at 65 to hold aggro, people are sometimes surprised
at how well a ranger can hold aggro.  The other bonus is all of those spells
are a low mana cost, meaning you can keep on going with minimal regen.
