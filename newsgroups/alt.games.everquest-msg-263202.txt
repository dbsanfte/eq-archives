I think it's worth noting here that there are raiders right now
who consider the primary value of LDoNs to be the tribute they
can get from otherwise useless (to them) drops there.  There
will never be a shortage of players who'll do something easy
over and over again for a measuable reward (cf. XP grinding,
all types of pharming including raiding already mastered
content, tradeskilling items with high resale or tribute value,
quad kiting trivial low blue mobs, & etc.)
