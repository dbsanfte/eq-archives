I've often wondered at the task of solving these quests for the first 
time. It seems to me that many of them are less than obvious, yet enough 
people are able to figure it out for the solution to make its way to 
Allakhazam. This in itself is a testement to either the determination of 
the players or the longevity of EQ itself.

Hmm. Maybe the item needed was just never added to the ground spawn 
tables. That would certainly be a broken quest.

This is actually how I would expect quests to be solved. One person 
figures it out, whether through trial and error or dumb luck, and tells a 
couple of other people, eventually causing the word to wind up on a 
messageboard someplace. At that point there's a chance of it being either 
buried by obscurity or picked up by others searching for that particular 
information and thereby spread to other sources.

As amazing a job as Allakhazam does at maintaining a thorough reference, 
even they won't have everthing.
