    Doesn't change my point, though, does it? :-) It reminds me of when you
read for a long time, then look away and see faint letters on everything you
look at.

    Must be a personal problem. ;-) The issue is the things behind the chat
windowblending into the text. The best solution I've seen involved changing
the background colour for the chat box itself. But now you've taken away a
big chunk of the visible screen, and made it look like the windowed mode you
say you want to avoid.

    I use the less-visible colours for my outgoing messages on chat
channels. They're mostly heal calls, and I don't really need to see them to
know what they say.

    It's the contrast between the grey where you've lost HPs, and the
background. Seeing a bunch of red lines is irrelevant if I don't have
information as to how those lines are decreasing over time relative to max,
or exactly how far off max they are. Again, the solution (making the
background of that window more opaque) just makes the window more like
windowed mode.

    I play with options non-stop, to go from "zero lag" mode to "XP group"
mode to "AoE group mode". It's an issue.

    It's about reaction time. If the same buttons are in the same spot, then
when you need to do something you get it done a lot faster than if you have
to think "where is that", even for a half second. I've been playing with the
small screen ever since I got the game, so knowing where to go to get things
done is instinctive. If I had everything that I use hotkeyed, I'd have to
remember what hotkey bank has what buttons. It would help if the slash
commands had the full functionality of the buttons, but in some crucial
cases like Camp they don't.

    It's easier to make different CH call buttons depending on who will be
after me in the CH chain than to change the social mid-raid and possibly
miss important instructions. So I have a selection of CH hotkeys, each one
keyed to one of our guild clerics. Every other hotkey in the "standard heal
mode" bank is identical. Under your system, I'd have one hotkey bank for
every cleric in the guild. Under mine, I go to socials, click over to the
page with the CH hotkeys, and drag the new one over.

    As I argued above, visibility is *impaired* in windowed mode. You might
be able to see every chain link on that froglok's mail coat (detail being
better), but because of the boxes taking up visible field space you might
not see the flipper at the edge of your screen indicating there's an add.
You stupidly cast CH instead of CE, and BAM - healer aggro. On raids,
especially, I want every possible object visible so I can make good
decisions that don't get me whacked. I don't care if they look like
undetailed blobs or not. :-)

    Ah, ok. I play in a lower res to minimize frame rate lag and so the
windowed mode fills my screen. I can understand why you'd go nuts if you had
the tiny window - I see it when I get rid of the Windows pointer artifact
when I first start for the day, and it's impossible to see anything in that.
