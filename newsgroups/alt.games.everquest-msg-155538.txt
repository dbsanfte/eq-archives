Max cha for vendor prices is 105.  My bard has 115 char
with equipment and I find that my charms almost always last
full duration.  I have boosted it to almost 200 and not been
able to tell a difference.  It is resisted maybe one in 10 casts,
if I use a wind instrument then the resists are almost non existant.
The instrument bonus means alot more than an extra 80-100 points
of chr.

If you get alot of resists boost your chr, if it breaks early you can
try boosting but I doubt it will help, then again at 50 you are probably
in some sort of penatly range there, get the stiens that give +25 and +15
chr and ask a nice shaman to give you thier long lasting chr buff, should
get you over 105 there, and I am sure thats all you need to be succesful
most of the time.
