You dot your group for free?  No wonder your money poor.    At 11pp ish a
shot could add up quickly in a nite if I had to pay for it.  Heck the loot
split alwas is poor for the non main looters.  If other *twink* clerics are
givving dots for free dont mean you have to.

As to the KEI issuse.  KEI means you can heal more they can pull faster.
And your at a level that its not unheard of with the hit points of the mobs
about that you should have a little boost in your mana regeration.  But,  I
myself get mine at the start of when I wish to play then when its done I am
gone for the nite.  3+ hours is ennough time to play at one sitting unless I
am camping something for me.

I have hated KEI till I started 2 boxing with my warrior in SF to get my
shards.  All it means is we can kill more and faster then before.  Heck I
can pull with myself oom to get a new mob and have ennought to start healing
if needed very quickly.  But I am no where near a gimp (251 w KEI) on my
cleric.

Luck to you and yours on your playing.
