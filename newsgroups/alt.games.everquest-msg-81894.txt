Why are you blaming Verant? They're just some computer
folks working on a game.

I blame the guys working the magic.  You know, the Nexus
Scions.  I think they're just too lazy to build another pad, and
you'd think it would warp the magics or something attuning
the same pad to 2 different places....

Wait...what'd you mean, "They're not real?"

Maybe I should go outside today...
