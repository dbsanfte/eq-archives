George pretty much hit the nail on the head here.

The biggest hit here are the whiners who want to solo when they really
shouldn't be. This is a grouping game. People whining about downtime now
won't really have that downtime as they will now be grouping in future.
Grouping with new Enchanters for Breeze, Clarity etc.

The biggest problem is that it has taken them such a long time to realise
the impact on the game that this bug has caused. People now rely on KEI to
exist in the game as they have not known any better.

I also think that 46 is still too low for the spell, C2 is lvl 46, KEI cap
should be more like 55.
