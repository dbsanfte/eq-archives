"Prolonged, extensive cat-to-cat contact is required for efficient spread,
because the virus is rapidly inactivated by warmth and drying."

So, now that we can tell who's "fucking clueless"...

As far as rabies transmission, maybe if you didn't make your cats sluggish
on purpose by removing one of their major sources for hormonal activity,
your cat could manage a clean kill on its prey.  :P  It's a rare enough
disease, and my pet has minimal enough exposure to potential carriers, that
I'm not concerned with the 0.0001% chance of my cat getting it.  I'd say the
odds are just as good my house will get struck by a meteor, and I'm not
particularly concerned about that either.

Because I'm aware of what it takes to transmit feline lukemia (as obviously
you are not), and my cat's risk of exposure is miniscule.  Like I've said
several times before in this thread, if you do not have the capability to
properly raise a pet, you shouldn't be raising one.  Let's hope you don't
have any cats, cause it took all of 30 seconds on google to find some
documentation on something that I'd asked the vet years ago, which means you
didn't even try *that* hard.  :P

You should post like that more often.  It gives people a much better idea of
what to expect in the care you give to "factual" content.
