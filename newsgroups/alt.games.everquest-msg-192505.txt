Whenever Sony has had a large update to EQ, I have gotten a pop-up saying
this program has changed, do I want to trust this program in the future. I
have just clicked on the pop-up indicating I do and things moved right
along.  Since the last major download this past week, the pop-up occurs and
everything is frozen at the password screen. No matter what I try I can not
get it unfrozen.

I have had to disable my firewall in order to play EQ.  I have McAfee
firewall.  I do see a way in the firewall to list "Trusted IP's".  My
problem is that I do not know the IP for EQ. ( It is not the WWW address).

Can any one help me by suggesting how to overcome this problem?  I hate to
disable my firewall for hours at a time.
