}I play on FV so I can not create an alt.

If you're really stuck somehow, send me a tell and I'll runnungetem.

}I am also a Human Cleric worshipping Innoruuk so I am KoS by default to 
}FV but Im not sure with OT. I heard that its on Venthril Sathir faction 
}and I have been hunting in Dreadlands a lot. :(

The only VS faction hit in DL I'm aware of is on Gorenaire, and it's a 
plus hit. :)  Dunno about Veltar for sure, but I think everything else is 
ok.  The unexpected bad VS hit is ogres in Timorous Deep.  But it's not a 
big hit if you only killed one or two. :)

The Goons from the outpost are the same model as the Dark Elf guards in 
Nektulos.  That's because, theoretically, they're Dark Elves in shiny 
armor.  So basically, the whole outpost thinks Innoruuk is just peachy.
And human is acceptable, although marginally. :)

Exactly how they came into posession of so many clockworks of obvious 
Gnomish manufacture is anyone's guess...  Dark Elves aren't exactly 
welcome in Ak'anon, although Neriak does tolerate our agnostics and 
Bertoxxolites.
