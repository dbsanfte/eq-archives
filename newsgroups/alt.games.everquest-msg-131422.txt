Sounds like a personal problem to me.  <Not> my responsibility.

You are insisting that everybody behave in a particular way to avoid
offending a particular group (you and those who feel as you do)
without the slightest regard for the fact that a different group of
people is in turn offended by the very behavior you advocate.  That
is really the root of "political correctness", showing special regard
for some "special" class of people regardless of others.

Aside:  This, of course, is what paralyzes the "politically correct"
when two or more of their "special" groups come into conflict.  Since
their only accepted mode of conflict resolution is absolute judgement
in favor of a privileged group they have no way to resolve a conflict
between privileged groups.  This has always been true of people who
think/behave this way.  All that is new is calling "liberals" who do
this with/for "protected classes" of people "politically correct".
