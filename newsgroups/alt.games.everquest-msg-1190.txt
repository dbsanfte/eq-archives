*shrug* then I wasn't talking about you.  I've heard many tanks and
enchanters DEMAND the best symbol.  Enchanters will usually DIE without
symbol when in peridot-type raids...yet they don't bother helping with the
cost?  How fair is that?  Just because enchanters are REQUIRED for high
level raids doesn't negate responsibility for their HPs.  Clerics are
REQUIRED for the same raids.  They are equally important...that's a fact.
Then why are clerics almost always expected to foot the cost of an equal?

As for tanks, who cares if one dies?   Who cares if 2 do?  "Tanks" are
needed, but they're a dime a dozen...one dies, just replace him...they're
disposable. :)

And you're saying that the longer you stay alive is ONLY the cleric's
problem?  You don't take any responsibility?  Why bother buying armor at
all?

The only 2 HP-type buffs *I* am aware of that require reagents are symbol
and rune (an incredibly expensive spell that my enchanter doesn't even
bother casting on himself).  As for plat vs time, I find time a hell of a
lot easier to get.  After almost 2 years I have about 3k TOPS (if I didn't
go into jewelcraft it'd be about 5k) and I've always been conservative when
buying stuff I could eventually get myself.  Time is easier to get.

Good!
