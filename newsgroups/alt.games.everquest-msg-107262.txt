A setting on your newsreading software to not display posts from certain 
users or in certain threads.  You really can't do it using google groups.  
If you download freeagent or xnews or one of the other fine news clients 
out there, it is explained in the help section.  (If you do, and just type 
news in for the name of the newsserver, you have about a 50% chance of 
having it work.  If it doesn't you need to contact your ISP.)

Because news propogation is wonky.  Some servers get posts out fast, 
others less fast.  Also some people set the x-no-archive flag, which stops 
google for archiving the posts.  I think it stops google from even 
displaying the posts.

Bizbee uses x-no-archive, so you won't see his stuff on google.
