Yep, Clerics and Mage fire? pets, if I remember rightly (been a while 
now).  Buff pets.  Clerics are assigned a pet each and complete heal 
each pet as they get down.  It takes a while, but if you have a diverse 
raid party, should be ok.  Clerics just need Clarity type buffs, and 
maybe a necro or two to give mana to clerics if they get low.  I was a 
level 60 cleric at the time, and just remember having to heal the pet 
constantly.

Havent fought that guy in a few years, but I am pretty sure they are the 
tactics we used.
