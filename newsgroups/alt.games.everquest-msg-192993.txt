A Barbarian BL (or any other non-evil PCs) can also go to North Karana
to the gypsy camp and turn the GLS in to a vendor named Mrysila.  You
can get there by a port or by going to the Nexus and taking the
Antonica portal.  I'm just wondering which is safer to go to, the
Oasis vendor or the NK vendor?  (I know there are wandering mobs in NK
also)
