If you're trying to run the GeForce 2 MX in AGP 4X mode, have you applied
the Via AGP 4x fix for nVidia detonator drivers?  You can find it on
tweaktown.com here:  http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/via_agp4x/  I had a
problem similar to this, and found that this fixed the issue with my GF2 +
Asus A7V (Via chipset as well).  Also, if you haven't already tried this,
get the 12.41 WHQL Certified detonator drivers from nVidia's website.
