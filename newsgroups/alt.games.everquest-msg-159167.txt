Yep. That's pretty much the truth of it in a nutshell. Sucks for the
casual player, but you've just summed up very nicely why it has to be
that way. If some really powerful thing drops, and you have a choice of
it going to somebody who will probably be there fighting for the guild
on 48 of the next 50 raids, and somebody who will likely show up for 2
of them, who would *you* suggest they give it to for the good of the
guild's advancement?
