No, no, no, NO! I do not want the Vah'Shir to be a large race, at least not an
exclusively large race, like ogres and trolls. They gotta be a medium to large
race, like barbarians, they just have to!

Aside from the fact that beastmaster is a leather class, and I now have three
stacks of HQ cat in anticipation of the demand for leather armor (cat makes
medium), I do not want to use an HQ bear for (oh, I shudder to think) bracers
that I will be lucky to sell for 5pp.
