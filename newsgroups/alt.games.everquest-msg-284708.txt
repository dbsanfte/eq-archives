You can buy a Longbow from vendor in EC for about 4pp which has a 100 
range, and you can easily get enough skill together to make range 150 
arrows, under an hour's work and under 10pp total expenditure to get 
that skill.

Range is indeed bow range plus arrow range.

I'd advise ignoring damage and delay, unless you are a ranger, you won't 
really be doing noticable damage with a bow, and even if you switch to a 
ranger, you won't be doing noticable damage until AA are available, 
which is at least a month away on a progression server.

Making a bow with a range to equal that longbow will require either 
serious luck or a lot more skill work than is needed to reliably make 
long range arrows, and will cost about 10pp per attempt.  With 110 
skill, I still don't see anything with longer range even as a "red" 
difficulty (which is to say, up to 160 skill).

You might keep your eye open for longer range bows, or bows with stats, 
in the bazaar:bazaar channel.

You should also make a point of getting throw stone and any other rogue 
usable discipline books; they are sold on an unmarked vendor in Freeport 
near the paladin guild.  Its actually a warrior discipline vendor, but 
there are a few disciplines which all melee can use.  For short range 
pulls having something that doesn't use up arrows is handy.

On the other hand, arrows have another nice feature; they take a little 
while to get to the target, particularly when launched from long range. 
  This means you can fire and then move, which might help you get out of 
range of roots or so on.

I haven't tried this, but it occurred to me that it might be interesting 
for a rogue to fire then hide before the arrow hit.  Would that prevent 
adds?
