All my groups have a shaman in them which does tends to bias my view
since slow and haste is covered. I'm also biased since the only
enchanter I group with on a regular basis also has a 65 mage and mages
are just so damn useful in LDoN.

You've never lost a LDoN adventure where you ran out of time?

Gear on the offtanks is pretty irrelevant since they're gonna be
tanking a 75% slowed mob anyway. Admittedly, they do have to handle
that mob until it's slowed but that's rarely a problem even with me
off-tanking <g>. Healing mana in that situation is also irrelevant
once you get quiessence with SCM3 and SCRM. 

Unless it's a serious overpull I find that you don't loose much DPS,
you just concentrate the high DPS classes on the main assist and let
an extra plate tank or the shaman offtank the first one or two adds.
There's also a hidden cost (DPS wise) there if you only kill mobs one
at a time. Damage shields, Clicky DoTs, DoTs in general, mage/shaman
pet AAs, necro wake the dead... All abilities that loose their
usefulness if all mobs are dropping in under 40 seconds.

Finally, there's always a couple of mobs in every dungeon that just
seem to be highly magic resistant. I don't know if you tash before a
mez attempt in LDoN but I'll routinely have one or two mobs in every
dungeon that resist 2 or 3 slows. Do that with mez and I'd imagine a
chanter goes down pretty quickly.

Definitely!

Nah, I have nothing against enchanters, I'd just never choose one I
didn't know for a pickup group in LDoN. One who isn't afraid to charm
or pacify pull fast enough to always have a mezzed mob in camp is
great but in my experience your odds of finding one of those in a
random pickup group are pretty slim.
