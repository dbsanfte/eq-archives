Saying KEI is breaking the game is much like saying that any of the things
people used to use to enhance their game ability (this includes any and all
high level buffs) broke the game when they were the best buffs around.  I
really think the problem is that people who have been playing the game for a
while don't like KEI because it makes the game so much easier than it was
for them when they started.  Not that I think the game *should* be easy...
but I doubt you complained about the buffs that were awesome buffs before
KEI came out, when you were first starting the game.
