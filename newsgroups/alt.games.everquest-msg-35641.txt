Have you, personally, swung any weapon until you were out of STA and found
that you were swinging very slowly?  I think the answer is "no," since you
said "I think you stop swinging."

Well, if you haven't personally proved it I hope you don't mind if I don't
believe the statement that started your post, "That's not true..." and
replace it with "I don't think that's true...."
