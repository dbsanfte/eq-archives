It comes about due to the arrival of limited numbers raiding.

Most raiding guilds have 'in demand' classes, even without limited 
attendance instanced raids, but until raids had a set size, not many 
guilds closed recruitment I don't think.

Time was 72 people at max, which was still pretty flexible, but once you 
had 9 clerics you didn't need any more.  GoD lowered the limit to 54, 
now you're starting to have to make sure you don't have 70 people log on 
every night who want to raid.  How do you handle that if they do, 
they'll just leave and go to other guilds, but if the wrong classes 
leave you can't beat those missions.

Later raids have changed the numbers even further, although my 
understanding is that core progression stuff is still 54 typically, but 
DoN certainly has some 42 and 24 person raids.

Raiding guilds who want to have the same people raiding regularly need 
to close applications when they hit their quota of a certain class 
because you can't generally beat 54 person raids with 13 clerics and 
everyone else dps (certainly not at the point where you're beating it 
for upgrades).
