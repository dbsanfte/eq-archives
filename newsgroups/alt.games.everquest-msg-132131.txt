Actually you are slightly wrong:

This is currently the FASTEST method, and will soon be the preferred.

http://docs.appliedbiosystems.com/pebiodocs/00103825.pdf

Applied Biosystems/Celera is the same company that sequenced the entire
human (and other) genomes a few years back, and are considered the
"Microsoft" of the Biotech world as described by the NY Times.

I bet someone like Ellen or Tom wouldn't ever guess I actually sell a
product that is designed to help people with AIDS get fast and accurate
treatment, better than ever before.
