Remember, this really depends upon your servers "economy" but, I suspect you
could get Full Wu's (13 pieces), 2 Cane of Tranquils, Orc Fang Necklace,
3str earrings and 2 jagged bands for ~2200pp

One my server the costs would be:

(2x) Cane of the Tranquil - 600-700pp each
Full Wu's (usually 10pp per ac) - 570-600pp
Jagged Bands - 25-40pp each
Golden Amber 3str earrings - 25pp each
Orc Fang Necklace 5ac 3str 3sta 3agi - 150-200pp

I guess thats what I would start with as for armor.  My monk isnt
necessarilly "seasoned" just a fyi, only level 32.. never really enjoyed
playing him as much.  Though, nice to play when Im in the mood for damage,
thats for sure.
