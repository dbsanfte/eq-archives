Just starting having this problem in the last week (and I play almost
everyday).  Seems soon after entering a zone, I start getting this
screeching sound that gets louder and louder until it's almost deafening,
not unlike the feedback from a mic next to a speaker.  If you type /reverb
it cancels it and the sound continues normally.  I've never had this problem
with any computer configuration I've had or in the 8 months I have been
playing.  I've had the current computer setup for the last 4-5 months and
have not updated any drivers in at least a month if not longer.  Anyone else
having this problem?  Is there a work around instead of having to type
/reverb each time I zone?

Thanks!

Rom

p.s.  I checked eqhardware.ini and eqclient.ini but didn't find any mention
of "REVERB".
