From the shadows, the mysterious "Skyllar Soultaker"
<Erik5150@Comcast.net> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially

I've seen quite a few people commenting that they should have been
getting more exp than they have been when solo. You have to wonder if
something has happened to solo exp since the last nerf.


>Does the evil empire (Sony), only want people to group now? Either in PoP or

LDoN regular exp sucks. Only fair aa exp too.
