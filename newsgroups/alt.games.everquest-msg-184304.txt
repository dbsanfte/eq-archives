You idiot.

2000 people spread out in the 30 original zones is how many per zone?

2300 people spread out in the 55 or so original and Kunark zones is
how many per zone?

2500 people spread out in the 75 or so original, Kunark and Velious
zones is how many per zone?

2700 people spread out in the 105 or so original, Kunark, Velious and
Luclin zones is how many per zone?

2750 people spread out in the 120 or so original, Kunark, Velious,
Luclin and planar zones is how many per zone?

2800 people spread out in the 125 or so original, Kunark, Velious,
Luclin, Planar and Ykesha zones is how many people per zone?

Do you think that might have some effect on the perception of how
crowded the world is now compared to three years ago?
