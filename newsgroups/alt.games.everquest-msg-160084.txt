    They evac, or Gate, or feign, or if they see someone between them and
the graveyard they die in place and ask for a res. At the bare minimum they
shout warnings and kite in circles while giving warning to groups in the
way, "MOVE". A lot of the people who are up there now got there by doing a
trial in a pick-up group, and just regard it as an extension of the outdoor
XP grind. I'm so happy we got flagged for CoD to escape it.

    If anything hits me, I take off running and start to kite in a circle
until I can assess the situation. On a bad combat round one mob will hit you
for 2000 damage and stun you (proc or from melee), which means it'll get
another round of attacks in. No caster can stand up to that. I'm over 5 K
HPs self-buffed, 1170ish AC and I can't stand up to that.

    Mobs trained through the castle will path back through it to get home.
My only two deaths came from taking one to avoid training someone, then
getting back to the castle ahead of the train (the rest of my group wasn't
so considerate) and being crushed from behind while I waited naked to get my
corpse dragged.

    I'm getting used to starting CH at 60-70 health. Non-guild warriors,
non-warriors, adds, groups with only rangers for slowing, a few lucky attack
rounds - better safe than sorry. As long as the tank can hold aggro after a
CH, I can sit and med and there's no mana issues. And if the mob heads
towards me when I try and sit, I use Yaulp V for aggro control. If we have
uncontrolled adds, time to kite in a circle and Supernal Remedy when I can!

    Everything in PoP seems to hit like those greens in Grieg's do.
