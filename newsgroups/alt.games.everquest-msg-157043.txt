FWIW, this is what I observed last night.

At 61, my unfocused EoT pet is light blue.  My book focused EoT pet is
dark blue.  I think that means 48 is the highest level of light blue
mob, that could be 47 though.  So, they didnt change it that much, if it
had stuck with the 75% or 15 levels thing 45 should have been the
highest light blue.  They did alter the progression some, but not by the
7-8 levels that we heard from the beta testers.  Its still annoying that
they would do this even after the shitstorm they got when they tried it
recently.  They really dont give a shit about what the players/customers
want.

I dinged in FG and 1/2 the shrooms went light blue.  Even some of the
Fungus Beasts were light blue.  I heard that most of Velks outside of
the castle was light blue, but I dont hunt there typically so I cant
say.  Katta Guards are out of the question now.  The entrance around HS
is going to be blue.  More of Seb will be green/light blue.  Some stuff
in ME will be light blue.  With the exception of Velks, those were all
places I could solo efficiently.

Yes there are PoP zones to make up for this but there are only 4 xp
zones initially, and some of the stuff is mean.  And, from what I saw,
there was not a lot of solo action to be had there.  The
level/difficulty range on the mobs in the planes is huge and you can get
some ass kicking mobs very near the zone in.

Say what you want about being a group game, I still think its crap
anytime soloing becomes more tedious.  I solo during the week simply
because I dont have the time to go through the hassles of finding a
group, only to xp for an hour or so.
