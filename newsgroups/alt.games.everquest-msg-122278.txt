I've heard something about bleeding the vendors or buying the vendors =
out or something....could someone explain why, and if this gives, I =
don't know, extended resources so you don't have to go and kill =
sh*tloads of spiders for their silk, or is this a tactic to purchase =
better armor and weapons without going thru a player?

Thanks....

Also, could someone drop a line on how to do the new quests in BB and QH =
with the gnolls?

One last thing, what level/time should I think about starting an =
enchanter(erudin) on jewelrycraft?  I have a character right now that =
can supplement just about 50pp to 100pp a week(don't play too =
much)....would ASAP be the best time to start, or when I have, say 500pp =
or so built up, extra,to use?

Thanks for any and all help and answers!!!:)
