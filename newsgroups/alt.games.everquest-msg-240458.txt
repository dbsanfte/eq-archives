Because it is outstanding.  Also quite exciting to know that somebody doing
such good music is involved in EQ2 development.  Good music is essential
to the experience, in my opinion.  And although Lineage 2 and World of
Warcraft have both showcased pretty good music, the music used in the EQ2
trailer is, by far, the best I've heard.

Anyone know who composed it?
