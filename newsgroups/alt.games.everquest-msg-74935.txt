I've made the run through kithicor at night and misty/runnyeye/xorbb with a
level 7 paladin unSoWed, uninvis.

There is no dangerous way to do the crossing unless you're an idiot.

Kithicor, if you're paranoid, just wait til day and follow the zone wall, or
follow the wall at night, only one or two undead things that even path up
there and they're usually away.  Besides, they have a small agro range in my
experience.

30 levels as a Halfling Warrior meant I either A) waste an assload of time
waiting for daylight, or B) pull up my greaves and start running.  I'm lazy
and impatient, guess which option I took?  (Hint: B)

Statistically, I made about 90-100 runs through Kithicor, say half at night
(although I could swear it was more like 80%)  rarely sowed, never invis.
NEVER died.  I agroed something 3 times, one time I was sowed, got HTed and
just kept running; one time a raid-gone-bad totally fucked up everything and
there was a small army outside Rivervale, I zone out, go eep, zone back in,
wait for morning; and the third time I got a dread wolf clawing my ass about
halfway to Rivervale, I could've killed it at the time, but I was in a hurry
to get back to highpass, just kept running and sucked it up, only took like
400hp off of me.

Runnyeye, if you're just passing through, is a piece of cake, if anything up
there attacks you, as long as you're over level 5, just keep running and
you're fine.

Xorbb, just hang up on the walls and you're fine, be careful of falls
though, you do have to come down at a few points, and besides, in my
experience, muddites run slower than an unSoWed ogre.  (Although at the time
of his unfortunate demise my warrior was Kindly with muddites from many many
dead gobbies in Highkeep)

EK is easy too, unless you're KoS to the druids, just follow the right hand
zone wall to the water out of Xorbb, then follow water to NK.

NK follow water to the zone wall off to the right then follow the wall to
WK.

WK, just run it, very few things in here have ever attacked me as long as I
have some minor degree of awareness.

And if you can't make it through Qeynos Hills or the Qeynos newbie yard,
please, delete your characters and cancel your account now.
