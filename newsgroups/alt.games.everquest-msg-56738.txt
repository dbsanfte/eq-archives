I guess i am that 10th person then, cause yesterday was my day off, yes
by the time i could get on, I was getting pissed too... However I know
patches are necessary and a part of a game.  I knew I was going to have
less play time yesterday due to the patch.  I also work afternoons, so I
am at home posting this when i could be playing.  Shit happens get over
it.  What they test on the test server with it's population that is at
best probably half that of the live servers isn't enough to find out
problems.  Lower total population, as well as less of any particular
class.

Personally it's been awhile since i can remember them having to do an
emergency patch.  It's much less often than the whiners seem to want to
admit.
