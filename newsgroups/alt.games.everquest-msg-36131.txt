Seems very slow to me, but fortunately I have a solution for you. STEAMFONT
mountains. That's right, head over to Steam font mountains and kill the
Elementals, drakes, harpies. If I remember correctly you can kill those till
14.  Just if you see LOTS of people running, or hear HERO yelled about, Run,
Run hard, run fast, run far, cause you WILL die. In 2 shots, I promise. No
if's, and's, or butt's. Death awaits you at the hands of the Mino Hero.
     Then head over to Oasis and stay there till 20. If In Oasis, and you hear
Shouts of SPECTRES or CAZEL to the Docks, Run, Run hard, run fast, run far.
Death awaits you, No iffs, and's or Butt's. 
      Then it's LOIL till like 26, on to Overthere till 40. If in the Overthere
you here shouts of DRAGOON to the Ledge, Run, Run Hard, run fast, run far.
Death awaits you, No Iff's, and's or Butt's.  
      Currently I am level 39 and have moved on to the dreadlands. But will
possibly wander back to Velious for a while so I can get the Seal of Thoradin
finished.

   The 39th level cleric with no name....
