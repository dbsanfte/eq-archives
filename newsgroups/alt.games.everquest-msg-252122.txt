Better way to ask is does someone perpatrating a cheat, deserve
protection from being double crossed? That answer is easier.

The don't deserve protection in a legal sense to transfer property
that doesn't belong to them. To make a huge profit doing that, and to
encorage griefing and scamming to make the plat to sell to these
scumbags is destroying the game.

They are like the crack dealer on the corner, who doesn't care how the
junkies get the cash just that they pay for each rock they buy.

These companies don't care because they don't play the game, and they
are not part of the community, they are parasites. I think they and
the players supporting them should be banned for life.

Sony owns the copyright to the name Everquest, they could at least
revoke the right to use the name and materials from the owners of the
auction sites.

Yes. Nobody seems to read it and nobody seems to think it is binding
on them.

Milton-Bradley wont reposses the Monopoly game is you cheat and steal
money from the bank, but it is cheating none the less.
