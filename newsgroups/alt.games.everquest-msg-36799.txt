As a chanter my INT is more than maxxed out. I have heard rumours of
secondary skills in all crafts and the general feeling is that Dex also
helps in Jewel craft. Has anyone have any confirmation of this?

As an experiment I had a shaman cast dex on me and also cast boon of garou
on myself and had some ridiculour amount of dex (approx 230) and seemed to
fail less but didnt conduct a thorough experiment.

Any thought?

Cost me about 1500pp in fails and sell backs to go from 242 to 243
