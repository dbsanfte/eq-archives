I appreciate the input, and I had my ifs on the casters, but I guess
the guild is one of the initial reasons I stoped playing a cleric.
Had always felt bad when someone dies, I just happend to get an
extream dosage on my first evening back.
One of the casters was a Wizard (the guildie that had invited me to
come) and the other was a Shaman, who drew large aggro from attempting
slowing one of the mobs, with 3 resists.  Someone later said they
thought that particular mob was unslowable. (not sure what the mobs
name was, but the puller said this would be our hardest mob)

again, thanks for the spirit boost.
