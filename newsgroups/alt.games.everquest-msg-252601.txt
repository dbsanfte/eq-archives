Not true.  One pure-melee quest I know of is very doable and
results in a 21% Haste neck, which you can upgrade to 24% by
completing the more PITA last part of the quest.  Always on
21% self Haste that stacks with Enchanter/Shaman Haste is a
way better spell than most of the others, and at least equal
to all.

On Stromm (the non-transfer server they openned shortly after
LoY came out) we made sure to get every one of the pure melees
in our guild the hard drop for the 21% neck as fast as we could.
Most of our hybrid melees didn't get a haste item until quite
some time later.  It was much easier to get that quest done
than to compete with 24x7 FBSS campers, for instance.
