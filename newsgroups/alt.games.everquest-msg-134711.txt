I just bought Everquest today and it seems to have been the worst day to buy
it....
but anyway, I am trying to connect to the patch server for the first time
and I am getting this following error message:
-----------
EverQuest file update failed.  If the problem persists, contact your network
administrator or internet service provider for assistance.
(patch.everquest.com:7000TCP)


* ERROR *:  A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the
socket is not connected and (when sending on a datagram socket using a
sendto call) no address was supplied.



If this is your first time playing EverQuest, refer to "Troubleshooting Your
Connection" in "EverQuest_Manual.txt"in your EverQuest folder.

-----------

I have looked around Google at past messages and all the responses to this
error message have been about firewalls and things, and I don't think I have
a firewall. I am just on my  new little laptop on a dialup connection. My
specs are
http://www.gateway.com/home/prod/hm_450xl_ProdDetail.shtml

WindowsXP
Pentium 4 1.7GHz
256  DDR SDRAM
v.92 Modem


Is this error message just because of all this conjestion or is somethign
wrong with my internet connection? I tried pinging the patch server and it
replied with 0% loss so.... I DONT KNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!


Thanks,
Brady
