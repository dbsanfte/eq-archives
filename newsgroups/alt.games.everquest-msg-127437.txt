Subject: Necromancer starting stats

I was thinking about starting a new necro (first ever char was a 36 necro) and
had an idea for stats.  I noticed with my old necro that lich would get me down
to a sliver of HP with only maybe a blue or so of mana gained.  A quick lifetap
or 2 raises the HP back to full, but takes away a great bit of mana,  thus
making an endless, very annoying cycle.  I was thinking, what if I put all of
my starting points into STA.  Since STA =  more HP, lich would be much more
efficient.  Add in some sta, hp, or mana gear and a few really nice INT items
to make up for it, I would be a mana regening machine.  Have any necros tried
this?
