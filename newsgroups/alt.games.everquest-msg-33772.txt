It's the rareness of the Cobalt that makes it so expensive vs Crafted.  Most
Crafted can be quested in the 20's, and the components are rather common
compared to other class quest armor.  Cobalt, on the other hand, is some of
the rarest dropping armor I've ever seen.  Singing Steel seems to be the
most common, followed by Deepwater.  I've managed to procure a full set of
Singing Steel for my bard twink, paying only 60k for both Legs and BP,
whereas I've seen someone auctioning Cobalt Greaves for 125k  and managed to
sell it quickly.  Likewise the effects on Cobalt are decent to the normally
non-casting warriors, so they are willing to pay more.  Especially in the
case of a bracers, for large race warriors who would love shrink, and all
warriors who would love the invis on the Cobalt Legs.
