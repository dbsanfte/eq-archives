Doesn't seem that anyone has mentioned faction.  It is possible that
he has killed something or naturally has worse faction with mobs in
that zone?  (People who have spent time in Unrest speak up on this, I
have not)  Easiest way to find out if its faction is (usually) to just
kill a mob and see if you get a faction message.

Because they hate you.  Mobs that hate you will always attack you if
you get close enough.  The lower they are compared to your level the
closer you have to get for them to decide to attack though...

Bring a snaring class so that when they hit 19%, they will turn and
stop attacking, but not run.  Snare cannot break like root.  Snare
will always go its full duration.  Snare rules.

In any case, expect to spend lots of mana to break a camp, just get
the camp broken.  You will be more mana efficient after the camp is
broken as you won't have to worry about fighting 3 or 4 at a time, as
you just kill them individually as they pop.
