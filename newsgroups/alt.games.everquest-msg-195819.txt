OK so I am runnin to Hell's Fury, gonna CoH my buds once I get there,
something sees my invis early, I barely get there alive.  Buffs get stripped
by zoning.  NO C3

I did ok.  Nuked less, actually had to SIT DOWN to med... eewwww.... but I
did ok.   Had a bard with us though.  Without the bard I woulda been medding
even more & nuking less.   Just takes longer to kill stuff & truly is (to
me) not as much fun.   Boots of Bladecalling take way to long to cast, mobs
died faster.  How long is the cast time on that staff?

After spending all that time staring at my spellbook, & then just sitting
there waiting on mana, nothing looks better to me in EQ that that nearly
full bar of mana.  NUKE NUKE NUKE   oh look its filling back up again!  =D
I love my C3 & am quite amazed that people seem to not like it or something.
