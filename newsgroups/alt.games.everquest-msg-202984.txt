Heh, my group dropped Zelnithak in UP today, and it dropped
a pair of lunar scimitars - 15wis, 7/24(?) with +5 magic damage
and a lot of stats.  Of course, the epic druid with us didn't
want one, so we went out of our way to ME/DSP to try to get
someone to loot them (got 1 of them looted off, the other rotted)
