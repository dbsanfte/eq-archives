The difference is you can buy plat, characters but you cant buy
knowledge.

You can look on allakhazam, castersrealm memories all your spells,
but, if you buy things that you didnt work your ass off for, or obtain
levels/toons that you didnt work your ass off for, you dont know them
as well as someone who did, you dont have the same oneness that comes
of having done it yourself.

Ever played a friends toon for a bit? if someone gave me 100k tomorrow
and I found stuff to spend it on (our bazaar is often not full of good
things) the toon Id be playing wouldnt be the same toon I know and
love, for most of us our armor changes over a period of time, we see
how each change effects us and makes a difference, we spend ages
making our plat, gaining our lvls, aas, and the exceitment of new
skills, the new levels, spells, toys (like horses or dinos) ...

If you grow up with a toon from 1 to the end.. you know very much how
its going to fair in any given battle given various circumstances.. if
you didnt, you dont know and you put everyone else at risk.

Thats the thing that hate - in my own pathetic opinion
