yay,

after 5 years of the same p3 733mhz, i am now stepping into the future...

except i have to build it myself !!

and there we have some issues:


i was given a few tips in the channel today (by Sarrss, i believe the name
was), who also recommended i post here about this ...

so...

what order, in general, is safest for installing components? i believe i was
told to stick the psu in the case and touch it to ground myself, stick cpu
to heatsink and that bundle into mobo, then mobo into case - add ram - and
try to boot up

that's what i did, except i got no good response ... the mobo and psu lit
up, but there were no fans moving so i shut it down ... i had the graphics
card in because i figured i'd have no other way to see if the system
recognized anything (there's no video out on the mobo ... am i missing
something in the instructions? was i supposed to boot it w/o any screen?)


then i realized i have no idea what to do with the tons and tons of wires
... it seems every fan in the case has a 4-plug male AND female pair of
plugs ... what's up with that? and the psu has 1 bundle of cords going to
the mobo, and then 2 seperate branches (identical) with lots of stems coming
off ...

the mobo (abit), psu, and case don't come with instructions for plugging
anything in anywhere (regarding power) so i'm kind of in the dark ...


anyway, once that's set, and assuming everything checks out, do i just throw
in the optical and floppy drives?


any walk-me-through help is appreciated =)
