I think if they want to improve the game, they need to do a better job
with the surrounding storyline other then just the players killing
various MOBs.

I think there needs to be more interaction with the NPC's that create
the environment.  Like in RL, there can be wars between 2
countries/races and certain things that are happening all the time
that affect RL "factions" or standings with either culture.  I think
they should try to somehow incorporate that into the game.  IE: there
should be generic "wars" between the high elves and the Dark elves,
and players can take sides and interact in it.  And they would
therefore take faction hits with either side.  Or a player can carry
out a quest for a leader of the High Elves to carry a message that is
affecting some type of treaty, and depending on how well the task is
handled will effect the interaction of the 2 races...this of course
would be a luck of the draw quest and only occur sporatically and not
too often...depending on the layout of the "story" being written.

Granted, that would actually require the GM's to get a bit more
involved other then solving disputes between players.  The Guides
should be able to do that while the GM's carry out handling events
that effect the whole of Norrath.

But there could always be more behind the scenes stuff that needs to
happen, I would just like it if that kind of stuff was in the game.
