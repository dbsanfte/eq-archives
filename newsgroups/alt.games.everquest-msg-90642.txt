Granted, my wizard is only a level 18, but I do know one thing. Having
a wizard in the group is like having the best debuff for the level BY
FAR provided the player halfway knows what they are doing. I mean, the
tanks only have to take the mob out some 60 to 75 percent after a
couple of heavy wizzie nukes at appropriate times. What would it take
to pry your crusty mits off a sword that provides a 30 percent hp
debuff and rampage/runner prevention?

Appropriate times: not initially until after the tanks have built
enough aggro and not to often after that - also, of course at the end,
early enough to maximize efficiency and help avoid berzerk/rampage
from the mob.

My one beef with being a wizzie, is that without a chanter with Tash,
if the nukes are resisted, you are pretty much twiddling your thumbs
until the next pull. That much sucks.
