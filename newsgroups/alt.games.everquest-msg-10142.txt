If that weapon is actually damage 17, it's a hell of a good weapon
for your level, and you'd do well to take the time to recover it,
even if you're going to start a new character (you can transfer
the good weapon to your new character).  If someone gave you a
weapon that good for free, they may have given you some pretty
nice armor too that you have yet to fully appreciate and you
shouldn't let that rot either.

First, your corpse is probably not close to decaying yet.  Contrary
to what the EQ manual (and supplement) say, level 3 corpses do *NOT*
decay anywhere near as fast as they say it does.  I did tests and
they stick around for quite some time, far, far in excess of the
"30 minutes" claimed in the manual.  One level 3 corpses lasted
for a full 24 hours (at least while offline).

Here's what I'd do to get your corpse back if I were you --

Option 1:  Take another long, boring boat ride.  But as soon as
the boat zones into Butherblock, leap off the boat and swim to land
OUTSIDE of the dock walls (away from the guards).  Note that there's
one dwarven NPC just north of the dock enclosure in the "woods",
so watch your step.

Option 2:  Beg a teleport to the Butcherblock druid rings from
a sympathetic druid.  Explain your plight and be polite and
patient, and it shouldn't take long for someone to give you
a freebie teleport.  (Or pay the standard 10p fee if your
benefactors graced you with that much coin.)

After you've gotten to Butcherblock by either method, determine
whether your corpse(s) are still there or not.  Do a "/corpse"
command, the message it returns will let you know if you do or
do not have corpses in that zone.  You can also do a "/who corpse"
(um, maybe "/who corpses", I forget) and it will list your
corpses.

If you do have a corpse or two in Butcherblock still, do a /shout,
asking if some kind soul would drag your corpse from in front of
Kaladim to wherever you are (use the /loc command, and give them
the coordinates of where you are standing).  Once someone agrees
to help, use the command "/consent your_helper's_name" to give
them permission to drag your corpse around BB.

Once they bring it to you, thank them profusely and then loot
as usual.

Now, how to get back to Freeport...

Either bum another teleport, or go back to the docks (not IN
the docks, just to them), and again go around the dock walls to
reach the water.  Watch for the boat to zone in.  Then swim
out to in front of the boat (not TOO near or the lady on the
dock will likely cream you), and wait for it to leave the
dock and start sailing again.  If you are properly in its
path, you will be "scooped up" by the boat as it passes over
you, and you'll end up on the lower deck of the boat, safely
on your way back to Freeport.

Consider it an adventure.
