OK, your instrument skills will go up, but only if you're weilding the
appropriate instrument.  Almost all instruments go in the secondary
slot, and you will not be able to use a weapon while holding an
instrument, at least not until much higher levels.  Head to your guild
and buy a hand drum.  Put your weapons in your pack, equip your drum,
fire up Selos and go for a run.  I've found that percussion was alwasy
maxxed, mainly because I am always running someplace and using it.
As to weapon skills, I wouldn't really worry about it yet, but you
will want to keep all weapon skills maxxed eventually.  In my career
as I bard I have used various combinations of 1hs, 1hb, and piercers.
I neglected 1hb initially, which came to haunt me when I got some
really good 1hb weapons about level 35.  Your 1hs and 1hb cap slightly
higher than piercing, but that won't affect you until level 51, so for
all practical purposes they are equally important.  Once you max out a
weapon skill [5*(level+1)], swap in another weapon until it's maxxed
too.  Soon levels will take long enough that everything will be
maxxed.

Yeah, at least one of the bard mail quests tells you to give the item
to the wrong NPC.  There are many spoiler sites that give the proper
information, my default site is http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

Adventure well young bard, and remember, nobody can run away from a
battle as well as a bard.
