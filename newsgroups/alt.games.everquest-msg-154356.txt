Sorbitol, actually... which is also a laxative... they didn't include the
rats that died of dehydration in their end numbers.
Result... flawed study, which was only taken seriously by news media looking
to shock their viewers/readers :o)

50 billion shots to kill you, but if that killer shot is the first one,
you're just as dead.
