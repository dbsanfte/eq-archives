Without knowing what your class is, this is difficult to answer.

Are you some kind of tank, just not currently the "main" tank?  Tanks and
Nukers are the principle users of the assist concept, healers tend to
concentrate on their own party, while enchanters need specifically to
target things other than the main target.

Is there an enchanter in the group?

If there is an enchanter, you should ignore the actions of adds unless they
are going after the chanter.  In order for him to mez mobs, it is important
that noone be hitting them, which will just break the mez.  On the other hand,
grabbing the mob that is beating on the chanter might be necessary to let
him get the mez off.  Trick is, once it starts pounding on you, stop attacking
it.

If there isn't a chanter, then you should discuss crowd control with
the group beforehand.  Some people are going to need rescuing, others
are likely capable of handling adds themselves.  Who is to do that
rescuing, how it should be handled... these are important questions.

For example, I frequently, absent a chanter (or with unmezable adds)
deliberately overheal to draw aggro, whereupon I can back up with the
add, root it while it beats on me, and then leave it standing there looking
stupid.  I don't want you coming along to play, despite people's knee
jerk reaction to a cleric getting hit I'm capable of sucking up a pretty
good amount of hits, and the root park only keeps a mob quiet if
its left alone.  Other clerics will feel radically different about this
circumstance, though, and fully expect to have a tank/ranger dedicated
to pulling stuff off of them in a tussle.

At any rate, absent good reason to do anything else, stay on
the main mob, kill it and move on to the next, even if noone is controlling
the rest of the mobs this is more efficient than hurting them all a little bit,
as dead mobs don't do any damage, but hurt ones still do.  You want
to drop a rock on one mobs' head, not rub em all with some sandpaper.
