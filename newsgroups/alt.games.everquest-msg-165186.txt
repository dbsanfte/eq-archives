I went from 14-18 kiting the lone guard at the Lava zone in Nektulos forest
(sp?).  Now that you got SoW, you snare, then dot and kite up and down the
canyon, stopping to DD.  You will take a few hits as you run by him, you will
have to pass him at least once, and he does hit hard.

Sit up on hill to side to med, that way you can see him pop.  Pops about every
6 minutes.  If your snare does not take, run to end of canyon and recast snare,
the lenght of the canyon gives you time to get it off.

You will NEED to get a mage friend to cast some no rent weghtless bags, or pay
one too, because the XP is great but the coin is not.  The guard drops no coin
at all, but does drop a sword that sells for 2.5 pp.  So if you fill up 6 4
slot bags (6 slot if you find a level 34 or above mage) you wil have about 60
plat for a little over 2 hours work plus great XP.

Not that you are loved now, but needless to say, but you wont ever be able to
show your face in Neriak ever.

Regards,
John
