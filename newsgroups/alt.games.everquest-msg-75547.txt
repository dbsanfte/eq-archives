I beg to differ with you the AMD K6 3D Now processor are socket 7 Pentium
based processor I have the K6 3D Now 450 It is a great chip for its time
clocked out to a PII 333. But it is still a Pentium based CPU that is
clocked at 450mhz. The K6 3D are running the Pentium command instruction set
with some added graphic instruction set. The AMD chips will blow the pants
off any Intel chip of the same rating but the K6 3D series can't compete
with the Intel PII or greater.
