In the camp you have 10 completed missions, you need to find the NPC
whose name was given to you by the first NPC you talked to back in your
home town. You should be able to find this conversation in your journal.

Or, you can do like I do and hail every named NPC in the camp until you
get a conversation where you "recieve a valuable piece of information".
It will also tell you to hail this npc again. After the third or forth
hail you should get a message that your stone has grown in power. After
you zone the next time your augment will have the new stats.

Every so often after this you'll be told to track down some obscure NPC
in some nearby zone. If you have 5x10 missions in various camps then you
will get an additional 1ac +1 all stats and saves added to your
augmentation. You can have 10 in all 5 camps or 50 in one camp or any
multiple of 10 in any camp to achieve this.
