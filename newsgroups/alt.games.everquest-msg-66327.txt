According to castersrealm, wizards get their first familiar at level 29.

He doesn't fight, can't be meleed or nuked but should be able to be killed
via AE spells.
He does not die when zoning or camping.
He supposedly no longer suicides when the wizard goes invis.

Their purpose is to increase mana regen and decrease likelihood of fizzles.

Mana cost is 290.  Skill needed to cast, conjuration.  Average conjuration
skill of a level 29 wizard, (1).

(ok that last part was my guess...my 39 wizard had zero skill...now he's up
to 5...it took 2 full bars of mana to summon him and I'm still kicking
myself for typing /pet get lost to see if he went away...he does).
