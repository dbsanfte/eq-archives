Personally I think the dick was a pretty neato gift.

Hey - that's kinda personal. What I lack in skill I make up for in
enthusiasm.... *mutters*

What - now? In public?

Well - I guess I could use it to write his name in the snow if we had some
here...

Cook, Clean, Fetch Beer - yadda. I kinda like where this is going but last
time I mused openly on this topic my girlfriend withdrew BJ services for a
week. Consequently I am now a big fan of that "Equality" thingimy and the
BJ's flow freely once more...

> But again,

I thought it was advertising which did that?

Or it could just be plain ol' schizophrenia of course...

Yep - always use a condom these days ever since... *winces from the memory*

I spent 18 months living in Wagga Wagga. Hell? Pftttt...

Which part about preserving the BJ supply do you not understand?

No - but I tend to give warning during BJ's now... well, most of the time
anyway... Ok Ok- sometimes...  Shit - this doesn't mean I have to go back to
Wagga Wagga does it?

> That is the

Cool - I don't have to warn then? Sweeeeet!

> May you have a wonderful day, and God bless you
> Larry

Hey - isn't that the dude you said is going to fry my butt in a Lake of Fire
and send me to Wagga Wagga again? Now he's going to bless me? Hmmn- I think
they call that sort of behaviour Bipolar Disorder...
