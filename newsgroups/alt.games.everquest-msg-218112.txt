It's more complex than that, I think.  Most of the player base is
experienced.  The lower levels are trivial to me now, but not because of
anything Sony did...but rather because *I* know how to play.

Suppose I start some class that is totally different from any I've played
before.  Say, a Mage.  At new spell levels, there will be something to
learn, but, because I've learned *in* *general* how to be a good EQ player,
I'll learn the *specifics* of Mage-playing quickly.  The time between spell
levels is just grinding out XP, not learning like it was the first time
through.

Plus, a large fraction of low level characters are twinks.  I twinked my
Cleric at around 15 with about 500 plat worth of stuff from the Bazaar, and
things suddenly got a lot easier for him, just from the AC and HP gear.
Even actual newbies get twinked...because they meet and group with twinks,
and often the players of those twinks will give the newbie some stuff.  And
even if the newbie doesn't get twinked, merely playing with twinks makes
things easier for them.

So, I don't think the easiness people are seeing is *solely* due to changes
to the fundamental aspects of the game (or at least, changes due to Sony).
Much of it is a natural consequence of Everquest being stuffed full of
high level players.

Most of Sony's changes at low level are removing timesinks.  Since they
were timesinks that didn't involve much, if any, skill, these changes make
leveling faster, but not really much easier.  Some changes, like the NPC
conversation journal, will probably actually slow down leveling, as people
might do more quests, now that keeping track of stuff isn't a total pain in
the ass.

This is partly, I think, "the good old days".  Nothing is like the low
levels of your first game.  That's one of the reasons there isn't a lot of
switching between games when new games come out.  UO survived EQ and is
doing better than ever.  EQ and UO survived DAoC and are doing better than
ever.  EQ and UO and DAoC are surviving SWG and doing better than ever.
