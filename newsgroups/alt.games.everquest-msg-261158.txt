Personally, I found it quite refreshing having 60+ bards asking me how to 
charm kite.. and even funnier.. seeing more 60+ bards LFG than I have in a 
LONG time LoL..I swear, you take away something that amounts to some cheesy 
crap anyways.. and people are all pissed off.. of course I think they're mad 
because they didn't think CHA was important to a bard... I did get to see a 
bard in dulak trying to AE swarm in the armory.. the funny part was he died 
before he realized he wasn't doing damage to the mobs (guess you shouldn't 
walk away while swarming eh?) Oh.. and the AE songs still work.. it's just 
that you have to stop right b4 the song goes off.. almost like a real caster 
can't even MOVE when casting.. we just have to stop for a sec...
