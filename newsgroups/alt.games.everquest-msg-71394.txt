Of course they see daoc as a threat, they'd be crazy not to. Any new mmog game
coming out should be seen as a threat. My point is "So what?" What difference does
it make 'why' the changes/improvements were made?

What about all the changes/improvements that Verant made before daoc was
considered a 'threat?" Many things like the hybrid exp penalties that Verant previously
said they "will never EVER add to the game."
