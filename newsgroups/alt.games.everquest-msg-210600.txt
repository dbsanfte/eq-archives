Interesting.  I found that when I had a 65 chanter two-boxed along with my 
ranger that all the monks would ask for SoS so they could do their epic 
thing.

Costs 360 mana, doesn't give as much mana regen, doesn't absorb as much 
damage, and you don't get it til 63 (which means it requires a spec 
handin), a level which is quite a bit later than most wizards acquire their 
epic.  The only upside here is that it takes 5 seconds to cast instead of 
15.  Other than the mana cost it's nearly as good as the epic effect in 
most respects.  I did actually take this spell into account when I wrote 
that ;)
