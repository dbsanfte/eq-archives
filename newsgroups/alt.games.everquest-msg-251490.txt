Hmmm. I've been soloing since I started about 3 weeks ago. My
enjoyment hasn't diminished. One thing that has bothered me is two
of the times I turned someone down, a monster attacked my character
from behind. And they did nothing, just had their character stand
there. They said nothing. Makes me glad I didn't group with them,
obviously I couldn't trust them.

The other times someone asked me to group with them, I was less than
5 minutes from logging off. They didn't get upset. They just asked
someone else.
