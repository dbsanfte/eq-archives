Actually, Kith is much more dangerous during the day if the General
and his crew were up. They'll drop a group of level 50s in a
heartbeat. Not that dangerous single but if you run in their camp
unaware they'll make a mess of you.

In response to the poster, being level 10 you'll probably need some
high level help or you'll die more. If you died to the General and his
gang the easiest way is to just get a Necro or SK to summon your
corpse. Necro can go a step farther(not sure SK) and use a spell
Locate Corpse to track to it and FD if he needs to.  Then he can just
drag it to zone in after you consent. Being level 10 I wouldn't sweat
the rezz and just loot the corpse.
