It means I respond in kind.

If you noticed, I also included useful tidbits of information like ~tell the
necro not to cast on mezzed mobs. Now that I think about it, I didn't find a
single bit of useful information about the game in your post.

The lack of useful information in their posts is what makes their posts
pointless to read. The dangerous part of it is to the new player they create
a false impression 'I'd better not group with a necro because they will be
casting their darkness line on mezzed mobs.' In truth I have never seen this
happen in the game.

Giving out bad information in a thread so they can try and fake having some
knowledge about how the game works is pretty pathetic.
