Do you have the Luclin expansion? Ok well then visit www.eqatlas.com to
check maps of High Hold, Eastern Karana and North Karana, The nexus, and the
Bazaar.

Try getting to North Karana. Maybe a friendly druid will port you.
There, heading southwest following the river if needed, you will find a big
portal. Also called the spires.
When you close you the woman standing there, Nexus someting, you only have
to say 'journey to luclin', and she will give you a stone which you have to
stow away in your inventory. Hail here to get the whole story.
After a while you will ported to the Nexus, you can alway ask if people can
lead you to the Bazaar, but it is the South exit.

Hope you get there...
