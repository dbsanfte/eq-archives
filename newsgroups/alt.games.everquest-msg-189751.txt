Even though it was not on your list I highly recommend EQ Online
Adventures for Play station 2. I have played all the MOGs currently
out there and EQOA is by far my favorite. ( I played EQPC for years)

It is casual player friendly and you can do fun quests instead of
level grind all the time. Below is an evluation I once wrote on EQOA
v.s. AC2. Since I worte this I have cancelled my AC2 account.

I got AC2 for PC and EQOA for Play Station 2 roughly about the same
time. About 2.5 weeks ago. I have noticed I am playing EQOA and not
much AC2 and just sat down to try an figure out why. At my current
play rate I will be canceling AC2 before the free month is up and
renewing EQOA

1) Transportation. AC2 allows you to go anywhere via its portal system
instantly. There is an in game map that shows all the places and where
items of interest are.  EQOA requires you to explore. There is no in
game map system. You must run to a town with a coachman and sign his
ledger before you can use that coach. Thereafter you can travel
instantly between coach houses. This is actually more fun than the AC2
method.

2) Graphics. AC2 has great looking graphics. One problem though is I
can be standing a little ways from a major city and all I see is a
sign post and empty desert. As I run up SUDDENLY the whole city
appears. This type of clipping is horrible for in-game immersion. It
is not due to my graphic settings as I have clipping set to farthest
distance and it still occurs. An example is running up to Cragstone
from the east on the path. There is also lag in turning etc at random
times. Even with recommend graphic settings and good system specs.

The graphics in EQOA are TV style console graphics. BUT they are
acceptable and there is NOT a clipping problems as in AC2 and never
any lag in drawing or moving.

The EQOA graphics are preferable.

3) Flexibility. AC2 allows to respec your character to be what you
want. A very nice system in theory. EQOA is class based and fixed and
you have to reroll another character to try a different class. In some
ways the EQOA system is better as the game is designed to work around
certain known classes. In AC2 folks tend to find out the best
"template" and then emulate that one. I like the AC2 idea but game
play supports the EQOA class system better. When you meet someone you
know what class they are and what they can do. If you group with them
you can have certain expectations. In AC2 it is much harder to
understand rolls in a group. IN general though I did not group often
in AC2 and have grouped more in EQOA. IN EQOA the classes are balanced
so that no one classes has it all. There is give and take between the
classes. In AC2 you can be totally self-sufficient if you want. This
tends to remove the more traditional groupings.

4) tradeskills. The tradeskill system in AC2 is intricate and
complete. Problem is that anything you need at low levels you must
make yourself. The game population is so low there is no economy. The
tradeskills in AC2 also tend to be a time sink as you feel you must
run everyday to certain "mines" to harvest ores, also since there is
no economy you feel a strong desire to turn objects you find into
tradeskill items instead of transmuting them. All in all a bit of a
painful time sink. One I could do without. Starts to feel like work
and not fun.

Currently EQOA has no tradeskills. All items are either drops or
vendor bought.

At this time I like EQOA better as I do not feel "forced" to do
tradeskills.

5) Both games are casual player friendly. You can jump and play in
small blocks of time. Excellent. There is no forced grouping and if
characters are picked properly soloing is easy.

6) Both are magic and sword and sorcery type games. AC2 has
proprietary races while EQOA is more Tolkien style. I do not like the
races in AC2 other than the human. Of the races in EQOA I like the
Barbarians, Elves and Humans (two types). Not a problem in either game
as the races I like can do the things I want to do.

7) Feel of the world. In EQOA there are NPCS everywhere. They may have
limited conversation. They patrol, they are in homes, they are in
shops, they are vendors, they are quest givers, they can be found deep
in the woods etc. You can run to them for help or they can attack you
due to your factions based on things you have done. The world has a
wonderful alive feel because of it.

AC2 has a few quest giving NPCs and that is it. The world feels dead
and sterile. Monsters everywhere and nothing else. Not even many
players.

8) Quests. Both game have excellent quests that are fun. Both have an
in game quest journal. Neither game has an easy way to find out the
quest givers. EQOA quests are not timed. AC2 has timed quests. I hate
that. Even with a long timer on the quest I feel an urge to complete
the quest before the timer runs out. This is an irritant.

9) The world in AC2 is covered in winter. It is all snow and ice no
matter where I go. All the cities are in ruins and the buildings are
dummy shells I can not enter. Very depressing. If I wanted to see
winter I would look outside.

In EQOA there are frozen areas like Halas, woods like Surefall, plains
in the karanas, varied cities and towns etc. Many varied and different
areas to see. Much much better.

10) PvP. AC2 has PvP areas and certain things that require PvP. EQOA
has no PvP at all. I prefer no PVP so once again EQOA is my
preference.

I am going to give AC2 another try this week after the monthly update
is done. There is still a week or so to go on my free month.
