Oh, I decided to do something really fucking stupid, I'll tell you my name,
but you have to work to get it.

Log on to Tarew Marr, create a newbie to harass me with, do a /who all 52
wood elf druid at least once an hour for 7 days straight, tell anyone that
comes up that they're a moron on AGE, eventually, you'll get to me, I'll say
something along the lines of  'thx /ignore sir', followed immediately by a
petition and report, you will have satisified your inner stalker by finding
me (no doubt you will immediately begin to spread shit around the server
with my name appended), and I will have satisfied my innate desire for
idiots to not be allowed to reproduce by getting you banned.
