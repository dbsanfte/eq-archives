Just popping in here for the helluvit.  I think half the problem is
just *finding* a good necro.  Last night was the first time my cleric
grouped with a necro - and actually had two of 'em in the group!  One
at 41 and the other at 54.  The younger was a guildie, the older
wandered by and fell in love with the guildie at first sight - so we
invited him along.  Dang, but the addition of those two dramatically
sped up the kill rates.  Really have never seen Necros looking for
groups before, so haven't had many chances to group up with 'em.  Have
to say it was a positive experience.

I think I can see where a poorly played Necro would really hurt a
group, but that can be said about every other class - and some much
more so  (I remember a ranger once who hadn't even heard the term
"Aggro Management" before.  He was 47'ish at the time. [no, I'm not
picking on rangers in general!]).
