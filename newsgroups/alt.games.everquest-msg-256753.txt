I agree.  Yes it's a game but aren't games supposed to be fun?  So
what if there's maybe no loot in it for you?  Don't you want the pulse
quickening excitement of a near wipe only to come back and win?  Or
maybe it was a wipe but you learned something and had stories to tell
afterwards?

"What's in it for me?"  Sheesh, what is this world coming to?  I play
because it's fun, if it's not then why would I play?  If it's not fun
it's work, and I can get paid for that...

It wasn't irrelevant.  The question was: "what's the incentive".  He was
responding to that question, and I totally agree with his response.  
People often attend raids where they know they aren't going to get any
"reward".  They do it for fun and excitement and to help out their friends.
