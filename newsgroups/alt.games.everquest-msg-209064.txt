Err...buy button isn't available? *blinks* Never seen that one.
Inventory space all full, maybe? I dunno... Clicking on the item you
want to buy first, right? Of course....

Hmm, most every race now has neato little quests you should be able to
start doing by level 9 for a rather nice low level set of armor. Check
out http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/zlist.html and click on your
starting city. Should find a list of quests and a group for armor
pieces for each class. Many of the items for the quests can be found
on vendors, even (many of the items are nodrop and, thus, can't,
though).
