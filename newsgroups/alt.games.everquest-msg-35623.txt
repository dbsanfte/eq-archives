I love EQ PvP (especially Sullon), but as many have stated, it is quite
flawwed due to the fact that EQ was not initially designed as a PvP game. On
most servers, the PoD and guildwar are the only ways to engage in fights
against other players. Many folks miss out on the excitment of PvP battles
because of this but simply aren't willing to "go red" with PvP servers as
they currently are.

One of the main problems I think is the way which VI is undertaking creating
PvP environments. Turning on everyone's PvP flag then trying to limit the
chaos with level ranges and risk/reward is ineffective (unless what you are
going for is Quake with spells). Team play has somewhat helped, but only to
a small degree.

What Verant should have done is to create some sort of PvP environment which
works around the already existing methods of PvP. The problem is that there
is no incentive to turning in your book to the PoD and becoming PvP enabled.
Likewise, there is no real incentive to challenging another player to a
duel. The solution is to change this. Have it so people may not form or join
a guild unless they are PvP enabled. This would actually be close to what
Rallos was meant to be, PvP with teams determined by players. As for duel,
(and this is interesting) make it so if a player declines a duel to another
player within a reasonable level range, they lose all the money on them to
the challenger. The same would have to apply if the player dies in the duel,
zones, or fails to respond within a reasonable ammount of seconds. The only
choice a cowardly player would have if they had money on them but didn't
want to fight for it would be to (within the response time) quickly die to a
MOB, or run as fast as they can to the bank (without zoning).

What will be interesting to see, is how many guilds form and how alliances
roll out. Alliances on Rallos formed but were difficult to uphold due to the
all-out-war all-vs-all environment. Rallos also has many notable anti-PK
guilds. This type of thing will be welcome in this environment. Also, seeing
how the duelers acting as bandits position themselves on the map will be
interesting. Too far from town and your victims most likely won't be
carrying much cash. Too close to the bank and people will be able to run and
bank their plat quickly. I predict Freeport would be the city of choice for
these would-be-bandits. I wish there were some way to also incorporate the
duel feature to deal with annoying beggars, but the reality would likely be
that beggars will hang around the bank. (hey... at least they will be
centralized!). Also, this would discourage the existence of uberguilds
whoose sole purpose is raiding/farming mad loot/gear. If guilds like these
form up, they must do one of two things, be prepared to defend themselves,
or get along with the other guilds.

Anyway, z'just some stuff I thought up while waiting for a corpse camper to
get tired and log.
