I probably missed a lot of updates to the story over the weekend, but was it
ever determined exactly which "exploit" Verant was citing? Or "exploits" if
multiple infractions were cited?  You used some interesting terminology in a
different post in this thread........ [sic] 'Verant requires at least *some*
level of risk' etc.
   <Conquest> may be full of shit, or not, but it looked like the "Cleric under
the bridge" trick wasn't working from what we read. The Clerics were, in fact,
getting summoned, and then getting called back with CotH, yes? Which means the
mobs had a shot at them, yes? I think that's still the problem that I and a lot
of others have with this.  It's gray areas like that, where apparently Verant
knows right where to draw the line (though it may vary wildly from one GM to the
next) and we have to guess.  But with these guidelines, I have to say that you,
Biz, and everyone else saying "You *KNOW* when you're cheating" really can't
back it up. How much risk is "enough"?  Unless other abuses were cited
specifically by Verant, I still don't see how it was "risk free" if they third
mob was kicking their asses that badly when the raid got shut down.
   How about the other discussion here on the new GB quest mobs? The way that
they are in places where all their "supporting" friends are so low level that
the mobs are left helpless and alone up against a big scary warrior like me. I
killed hundreds and made almost two levels solo without every coming really
close to being killed. Was I "abusing and exploit" there?  I'm really curious to
hear all the EQ Lawyers' call on this one.  Or was what I did just fine?
