Overthere is fine, there is never a problem finding things to kill and
it can handle over a 100 in zone with relative ease.

However once you hit 40, you'll be bombarded with people telling you
to go to dreadlands. Don't listen. DL is where the unskilled end up.
You should be hitting dungeons by 40 (which are much better anyways).
Those in DL to 50 are notorious for being unreliable in a dungeon
setting. Do yourself a favor and learn high end dungeons before you're
being depended on in sebilis or velketor.

Hudson Hawk: "Gates tries to blackmail me, you ask me 'Did I miss
anything.' Gates gets killed, you say 'Did I miss anything.' I bet
you went up to Mrs. Lincoln at the Ford Theatre and said 'How was
the show? Did I miss anything?'"
