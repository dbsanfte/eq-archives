Not to re start another thread or two, but i find some of the stupid names
quite amusing. Dont get me wrong, i agree that they infringe on the atmosphere
but they make me laugh and thats the truth :)
So, whats the silliest name you've seen?
I've seen :
Cinnamon Buns
Givmesow
Brek dahncer
and i thought punchyourhead worsethanu and all the others mentioned here were
funny, so let er rip, lets see em.
