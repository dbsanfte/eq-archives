If your cleric has more mana that you, skip the slows. If you have more
mana than the cleric, slow, stun, mes and nuke. It's all about balancing
the group. If one member is OOM, everyone has to wait, irrespective of
how much mana they have. Much better to have everyone at approximately
the same battle readiness.
