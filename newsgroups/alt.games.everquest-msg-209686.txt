I've gotten comfortable playing the cleric Aoebe, Level 19, and
have done a number of quests related to the newbie armor,
Crushbone pads and belts, bone chips, and am considering doing
the Halas quest for the head of the dude in the Karanas that
you have to have the sweaty shirt for.

Here's the thought that troubles me.....all of the quests seem to give
out something several orders of magnatude less than the level needed
to do the quest.  For instance the mace quest as the final mission for
the cleric newbie armor quest....if I had not had the last of my crack
KEI, Iwould never have been able to take the dude in the plague hut, thus
getting the paper to return for the mace....the dark ember mace I bought
in the bazaar from selling Kiolas is better.

Note I am not complaining, just asking if others feel the same that the
quests have changed from what I heard they were when the game was younger.

I still get a charge from killing bear cubs in Everfrost and *slowly*
clicking on the
to see the quality of the bear skin pelt.  I keep the ruined pelts and make
armor for
folks lower than me....I even give out a newb kit (backpack, tarnished
swords, bandages
and patchwork....)  I have stacks and stacks of studs that I make into armor
if the
player brings the pelts and the pattern to me.....

rambling.....work in RL is on edge....maybe more time to play if the axe
falls....

One last thing, started a wizard a while back, want to ditch her, and start
a gnome/wiz
with same name.....can that be done?

Aoebe
