Took my level 11 bard back up to shadow haven. Wandered around and found
that many NPC wouldn'y talk to me. Found I could get faction by doing a
quest
involving delivering things to people. Went to fungus grove for one of them.
And
died horribly in echo caverns on the way back.

Took my level 30 necro up to shadow haven. Dragged the corpse to the exit
to echo caverns.

Decided that I'd been level 30 for about 4 months now and it was time I got
some
more levels instead of being a tourist so decided to head off through
paludal
caverns looking for somewhere to hunt. But got sidetracked killing those
lizard things
for no good reason.

That's about it. I *really* must get some more levels on my necro this next
couple of weeks.,
