DOh, And I was really trying to be comprehensive, including both the 
wizard and druid pets...(cleric pet is actually worthwhile for a few levels)

Fifth class in category 1 (get pet every few levels, controllable)
SK pet (9)  Least damage output and tanking ability of this category, 
but does do a measurable amount of DPS as long as it isn't required to tank.
