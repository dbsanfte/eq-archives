Workable, if they clearly mark the items as so:

Steel sword of I-used-my-moms-credit-card-to-buy-this

or

Breastplate of
Why-play-the-game-when-I-can-just-do-some-overtime-and-get-better-stuff

Game items do not exist except as a few electrons floating around in
some computer somewhere. If you remove the effort needed to get them,
they have no meaning.

If I were to spend hours of my and my guild friends time and effort to
obtain a Shaman 1.5 Epic, that means something. Not in the real world,
or course, but it has meaning to the game world we have agreed to play
by. Now if someone comes over and plops down $50.00 and buys that same
item, he cheepens my and my friends efforts to obtain it.

If what he is doing is against the rules, them my honest effort is
still worthy. If what he did is sanctioned by SoE, then he makes my
effort lessened.
