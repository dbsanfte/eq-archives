hehe.. /agree, takes too long to drop down through hole, run to a pot
and click on it.

My gnome mage use to be bound right in front of the Ak'anon pot, but
use Felewithe as well due to nexus spire.

LOL.. well it happened to my mage once.. he was 53 at the time, when I
was using the Ak'Anon pot.
That pot is on the west wall , so each time before I gated I made sure
I was facing west, so I was facing the pot when I gated in.
Well  time Fay was in the firepot room when I popped in... 
She commenced to beating the crap out of me and I am like WTF.. whats
hitting me.. duh, oh crap its the frigging dragon.  I quickly click on
Ak'Anon and got out of there.
When I got to gnomie city.. I was down to 1 bubble of health. which
happend in the blink of a eye or so it  seemed.
I have a lot of HP for a caster too. I pumped several points in
stamina when I  first made him.
