Yes, feel free to.

No, it isn't. It's a reward that is earned and is nontransferrable out of 
game.

It does in the context of the game. When someone ninjas the CoF on a Naggy 
raid, how many people honestly go "Oh well, it doesn't really exist 
anyway"?

I see their side of it. *My* side of it is this:

Sell your time in the form of knowledge if you want. Write pay-only 
guides or whatever. Sell access to a DB that catalogs items (say, 
allakhazam) Just don't sell it in a way that directly affects me in game, 
because it's not fair to the players who actually deserve to be there. When 
that PLed wizzie with an evocation of 75 or the ebay warrior that has no 
taunt key set up ends up in your PoV group, you will likely feel the same. 
Likewise when you need an item you can't buy because you don't have 8+ 
hours a day to farm plat and you can't camp for because the people selling 
it for RL money have it permacamped.
