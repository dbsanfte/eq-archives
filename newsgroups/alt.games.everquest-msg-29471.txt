I've been hunting for Forest Loops at the fort in Fountier Mountains for
sometime now.  I've only seen two drop in the several days I've been there
and didn't win either in the lottery.  Is there a better place to hunt
Forest Loops?  Then again, is there a better earring for a 31 lvl Halfling
cleric can hunt for?  Either solo or, if groups are common for the spot, in
groups.
