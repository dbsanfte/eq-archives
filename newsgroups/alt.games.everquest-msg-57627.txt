There was a very short period of time before they were put on the
vendors, like as long as 2 weeks? I remember that for some reason
right after a patch I was selling to the POG tower vendors and spoted
them there for the first time (they were not there the day before) The
sad thing was you immediately saw A LOT of them being sold at full pre
vendor price trying to get people to pay 2 k before they knew. If I
saw that I'd immediately /ooc "or you can just go to wakening lands
and buy them off the vendor."

The wiz ones took a bit longer to find since they were on a skyshrine
spell vendor after falling through a secret hole in the floor. It
probably only took a while because most people did not have their
factions high enough to buy from the vendors yet.
