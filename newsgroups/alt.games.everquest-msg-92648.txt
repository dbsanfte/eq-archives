    You'll need to download a copy of Direct X the latest one thinks it's
still 8.1 not sure of the site though an install it after you load Luclin.
    You don't really need 512mb of Ram but it wouldn't hurt, and a
(geoforce) driven type video card would probably be better then the voodoo
one IMO.  That's only cause I don't have a (geoforce) video card the game
still play on my computer but I get alot of chop and lag through forest and
big grassy areas.
    This is my 2cp hope it helps you.
