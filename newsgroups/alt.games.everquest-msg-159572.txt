Well there is an event in lake but kinda lame. Drakes in lake of ill
manners. They ought to have taken the money they wasted on coding time
and paid somebody to patch in last years, big thumbs down to halloween
event this year especially after last years smash leaves this one
looking half ass and lame. Leaves me craving for undead invasion in
qeynos. At least that was relavent to the holiday.
