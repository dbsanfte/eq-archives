Check out these sites: http://www.attcanada.net/~reaper/ good bard info.
and this one: http://eq.castersrealm.com/creationguides/Bard.asp good
creation guide.

I personally made a Half-Elf bard. They have better starting stats, but they
can only wear medium armor, which really isn't a problem. If you go Half
Elf, I suggest Freeport as your starting city. I think Antonica has more to
offer a Half-Elf than does Faydwer. Mostly because of the medium armor
aspect.

As far as stat allocation, I followed the suggestion of the creation guide
above, and have enjoyed my bard eminsely.
