I have to say that at 51st level playing this game for loot and such thats
good at that level is ridiculous. I see players far below me with better
gear . These loot rules suck IMHO . try soloing any mob over 40th level with
a 51 warrior you are most likely gonna die. so where is the loot code
needed? By the time I can solo the mobs I cant loot them? where is that fair
at all? Verant has done the ultimate sin they have forced you to group at
low levels and at high levels. if a 25th level Highland Tiger in Stonebrunt
can take over 505 of a 51st level warriors health them he should get the
loot right? I am tired of getting a trivial msg when it damn nearnt kills me
to just escape. I think that Verant needs to find a better method of
controlling loot. The method used in warrens and stonebrunt is unfair to all
even the low levels that can loot there.
