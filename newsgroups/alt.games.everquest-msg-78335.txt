Sure, it'd be nice but at some point enough has got to be enough. :)  Had
you started smithing a couple years ago the components may not have been
stackable (not sure) and if it were stackable you'd have to click on the
stack then manually move it back to 1 item.  Add to that, if you combined
something that wasn't a correct recipe you'd lose the components.

Now maybe you'll remember that the CTRL key and the SHIFT key aren't the
same thing. :p

But yeah, I feel for ya, just don't hold your breath.  Can't hurt to
/feedback it, though.
