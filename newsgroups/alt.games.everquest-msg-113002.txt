Both races are pretty well balanced. 

Here are a few of points that will matter the most....

1. Iksars are hated almost everywhere. If you like to travel a lot
(especially in the old world) be prepared to do a LOT of faction work
or a lot of sneaking around if you choose Iksar. Velious and Luclin
are better, but you will still be KoS to more faction groups than a
Human.
2. Iksar have a 20% exp penalty to offset thier natural regen. The
regen is GREAT!, but you have to earn 1 more yellow bubble per level
than a human.
3. Iksars get an AC bonus (@50 points of raw AC at level 60)
4. Iksar have one of the BEST newbie areas to level (Field of
Bone-Kurns Tower-Lake of Ill Omen, etc)
5. Humans are night blind

For bonus points go with STA. Stamina is the hardest attribute to
raise with gear. You will find tons of STR, DEX, and AGI equipment for
all levels and price ranges.

You can find a lot more info at:
