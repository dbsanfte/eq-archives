When i learn how to automatically log everything, and set up a macro key so
that my attack key did a loc, then my time spent locating my poor body was
much reduced. Mind you, i remember going link dead and coming back unable to
find where I'd died or why... i suspect a griffon attacked me and i must
have run to the other end of the zone... and i was in the karanas! Thank you
to the kind lady who logged in her necro to track it down, then a cleric to
rez me.

I think having your compass point to your body would be nice.

I recall getting my first guild and being 50 pp to equip myself! I went and
bought some leather from the store. I played about a year ago and 50 pp
would have bought me better gear from the bazaar than any amount of money
would have allowed my young paladin to buy from the norrath npc's. At level
12 I'd gotten tired of freeport, so i wanted to explore, so i got on a boat
and went to butcherblock, got swarmed by bandits, ran, and found out that
there was a hill that if you went over, you fell through the ground and
died, and not knowing anything about petitions and gms, i lost everything i
had and ended up restarting later when kunark came out as an iksar monk. The
description in the game was that they didn't need gear. That was not true
and it became less and less so, but i loved that monk up until the great
monk nerf. Which apparently they only recently decided was a mistake, after
all.

Ghouls...immune to your weapons, and freezing you in place, so that they
could explain the implications (shudder). Wisps seemed to attack in swarms
but when you could finally kill them, you could really make some cash! I
could never keep track of the EC barter system, and loathed having someone
harass me with stuff when i wasn't buying... being a monk kept you poor in
any case. Didn't really make money till i started a druid, and then made a
lot when the bazaar came out. Went through fortunes on gear, and the
occasional bad investment.

Did the guards help with those guys? I seem to remember running to what i
thought was safety, only to be smashed as a guard stared blankly on. I also
recall walking around some ruined section of town, only to have a high level
dark elf run out from a door and smash me to pieces.

My druid maxed faction with some dark elf faction that i think was removed
from the game through that guy. I wish the steel warrior faction had been on
his list as i would have camped him with my monk, who always wanted to be
able to get in good with that lot. Or perhaps the barbarian faction (wolves
of the north?)... they were a hard bunch to please for an iksar.

And the swarms of bugs, and wizards swatting the whole lot with one blast,
and psycho treants attacking from a distance, and lovely faction hits from
smiting the bandits (good loot too!) and that lovely time i got to be able
to root rot a hill giant without having some thief nick all my loot ( i
loathed the pickpocket skill).

Watching someone who had bound herself to the docks, only to find why that
was a very very bad idea when a sand giant killed her there... specters were
truly scary though.

Those elves were insane. Railings, people! I was ally with my iksar to most
of them, but then i found out the hard way that the banker was on another
faction. :P

I was rather shocked by how eager "good" characters were to kill treants and
Quillmane. I always have been a roleplayer at heart.
