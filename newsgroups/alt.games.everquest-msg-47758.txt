Need the HQ bear skins to make backpacks, I got 4 skins so far, killed over 500
bears. If im really lucky i get to buy 10 a week.
Thats not regularly.

You can make the Small Deitys. Cost around 2pp to make the protection one, sell for
5-10pp.
Arond 7pp to make Resist one, sell for 15-25pp.
2-52pp (depend on price of Sands of Ro, i dont pay over 50pp for one) to make small
wisdom deity, sell for around 150pp.

You CAN make the idols, but look at the ingredients, DAMN hard to get a hold of.
And the stats on them suck. Looked at the stats, think i MIGHT be able to sell 2 of
them, cant even remember whick, think a STA one and a STR one, but the others are
not sellable at the price it would cost to make, and NOT worht the bother to get
ingredients.
