Hey everyone,

I've been playing EQ for awhile, started back in 2000, dropped off for
awhile and just recently picked it up again.  I'm just curious as to
people's opinions about Soloing vs. Grouping.  Not so much the
benefits, I know that gaining experience through grouping far
outweighs exp gain just by soloing.

But I am curious to see if there are others that prefer Soloing to
Grouping from a "gameplay" perspective.  I enjoy soloing in the game,
exploring new places on my own, testing my skills against unknown
foes, etc.  I enjoy grouping with a good group as well but I guess I
see it as more of a "bonus" than a standard thing.  Granted, my
characters aren't super high in level or else I suppose Grouping would
be more necessary.  But as I said, I am curious as to other players'
opinions.

Thanks for your time,
- Robert.
