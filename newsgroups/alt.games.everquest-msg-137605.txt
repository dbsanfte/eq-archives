It's an internal software modem, just a port.  I'm the one that started the
post.. reading through the thread, I went to www.newegg.com and bought a 'US
Robotics USR5410B 56K V.92 Internal PCI Performance Pro FaxModem.  It's a
hardware modem, and from what I've read about it it has different settings,
makes it better for games.  Anways, I'll give it a try.  Can't be worse than
what I'm on :).  Thanks for all the posts and the help.
