Ayye, the PNP is Verant saying they won't enforce the player
developed concept of camp claiming, thats all.

If you find a group at a camp location, they are there because
they can handle it, and the loot and exp is decent for them.

If they have to split it with a second group, then they suddenly
are getting half the loot and exp while operating at half their
normal capacity.

If you walk up and observe that they are -not- pulling spawns
as fast as they pop, and conclude that they would not be
losing any kill per hour by sharing the spawn, then you might
have a case.  Its rare that you see this happening, though.

I"d also say you'd have a case if a group was claiming a
vast number of spawns, like say the traditional "ass/sup and
friends" one.  If you wanted the cavalier specifically, you
might insist that they pick one camp to claim...odds are
they won't pick the one you wanted.  This approach won't
win you any friends, mind you, but it won't make you as
universally despised as the more direct claim jumpers.

Another alternate approach would be the one I've used...
if you can't get into a group, start one.  Camp the entrance
to the zone you want to fight in and wait for a more traditional
camp to open up. When it does, move there and keep waiting
for a better camp.   Keep your eye, not on "Group looking for
a (whatever the heck your class is)" messages but the far
more prevalent "(Class and level X) LFG messages.

More advanced; find a relatively unoccupied zone you want
to fight in, go to a more crowded one (at our levels, KC is
a good spot for this) and form your group there.
