I was sitting within the NK spires last night, waiting for friends to
arrive, when the periodic port to the Nexus took place.  I had not spoken to
the Scion, and I most certainly did not have a shard, but it zapped me up to
Luclin nonetheless.  As a wizard, it was merely an annoyance, as I could
port right back down, but had I been a non-porting class, I would have been
annoyed to say the least.

Is the shard completely unnecessary?  I've always gotten one when I intended
to port up, and have never been within the spires without one when the
automatic port took place before now.


Regards,
Nevala
