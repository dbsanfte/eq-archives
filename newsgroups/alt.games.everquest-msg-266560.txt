In my mind the poisoning is on them as they knowingly took food that they 
didnt prepare or make sure was safe to eat.  As for whether or not it will 
happen, I'm not trying to convince you to do it, just giving one option of 
many that you could use to persuade this thief from taking food that doesn't 
belong to them.  Are you even sure someone is taking the food and eating it, 
I have worked in an office with a community fridge and the food is often 
cleaned/thrown out daily.
