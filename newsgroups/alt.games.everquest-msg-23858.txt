You've never run into the Kromiff Death Squad?

Then you're lucky.   And you havne't done the 4'th Shawl Quest either. ; )


They are a random trap that is in East Wastes near Kael.   The trap can be at
any location in a rough half circle around the Kael entrance.   If you hug the
edge of the zone, you will avoid all of the possible trap locations.  (just
don't fall into Kael's Chasm without lev on.)

The KDS is 4 giants, level 45 ish or higher.  Highly magic resistant, run SoW
speed and see invisible.  They despawn as soon as they have nobody on thier
hate list, so they are not up unless someone tripped the trap.

If you insist, Biz.

There are several giants in Kael that see invisible.   They are mostly
blocking off the harder areas though, like the arena or the castle. (maybe
some others).

None of them hang around the passage from EW to WL.

There is also a group of see invis giants near the edge of the zone in WL that
sees invisible.   Frost Giant escorts, or something like that.   They're
relatively easy to pass by, as long as you're not completely hugging the edge
of the zone.

Wuoshi isn't a problem if you went through Kael.   Just don't turn south from
the Kael entrance, go northwest.
