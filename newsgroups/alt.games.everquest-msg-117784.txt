I made an earlier post stating that my Bard is level 36 in 15 days played.
I'm sure other people have better ratios.  This is my main but my 3rd
character ever created.  I don't think a low days played ratio means that he
isn't having fun.  I have a ton of fun playing my bard.  In fact, I don't
know why a lot of people don't play bards.  I love em....definately the
class for me.

I've seen and been through a lot of zones, even some I really have a low
chance of surviving in.  I usually don't take ports.  I run from one side of
the world to the other.  I like the scenery.  I'm also close to being a
master baker and brewer.  I group a lot and I haven't stuck with the LOIO,
FM, OT route either.

Also, this character is almost a year old in since the creation date so it's
not like I've been playing for 15 days straight.  Also, I have NOT been
powerleveled, even at early levels.  Some people log in and sit around afk
for a while.  I have nothing against that, but when I'm not actually playing
or doing a trade, I log off instead of sit in a corner hidden.

ALSO...there are some zones that I wouldn't run through with other
characters that I do with my bard, namely Kithicor.  Some others will risk
it but I don't with my other characters, with the exception of my bard.
Waiting for sunrise take time so my played time on other characters will be
increased simply for that fact.
