Howdy everyone.

When I originally created my first druid, a half elf, I didn't know where I
should put my points and hadn't yet found this newsgroup or most of the web
sites for EQ.  So I put a few points in wis and the rest in str.  Up to 14
that worked beautifully.  I would go toe to toe with my enemy and snare,
flame lick and dd whilst whacking away.  After 14, things started hitting
really hard.  Have you ever danced with a griffawn (Ouch!).  Anyway, I was
able to level but slowly; fighting mainly blues and high greens.  Kiting or
root/nuke seemed to quit working because I would run out mana before any of
the things at my level would die and root constantly breaks.  Seriously, in
a  group I couldn't manage to keep a single warrior healed with occasional
snares and sows.  SOW takes a bubble.  At 17, with 15 points in +wis items,
my wis was exactly 100.

So I decided to retire him and create a new guy with better wis.  I don't
like wood elves (well, at least not the males, heh).  So I tried a halfling.
I got him up to level 8.  Misty thicket is a great place to level.  I hate
being a halfling though.  Being a good druid, I decided to have him dance
naked in kith at midnight.

So, this last wednesday I create a human druid.  Dumped all I can into wis
and the last 5 points in str.  I decided not to twink excpet for a 5pp gift.
I took that 5pp and bought a cracked staff, a back pack and 6 stacks of bone
chips.  I turned the bone chips into the guy at the pally guild (the crush
the undead quest) for a bunch of rations and water flasks and xp to get me
to level 4, almost to 5.

I ran outside the gates of qeynos and killed a beetle which got me to 5.  I
got a bind at the qeynos gate.  Ran to surefall and got the mail, the note
for the favor and the flask of nitrates.  Gated back to qeynos and turned
the mail and the note in.

Got the blankets and the provisions from the pally guild, the lute and the
mail for highpass from the bard place, and the flask of holy oil for brother
estle from the cleric guild.  The guy at the cleric guild suggested I speak
to the clothspinner lady so I did.  I got a note for her sister in highpass
from her.

Headed out to west karana.  The borther wasn't at his tree so I headed up to
the shops and there he was.  Gave him his flask and he gave me some beads.

Headed south to the barbarian village and got the mail for qeynos. Headed
east towards north karana.

Stopped at the second farm and gave minya the provisions and she gave me
back an empty stein.  Gave linaya the flask of nitrates and ran away before
the unkempt druid showed up to kill her.  Sorry lady.

Went to the next farm and gave the guy there the blankets.  Ran the rest of
the way to north karana along the water, camoed.

In north karana I stayed near the water until I got to the south karana
bridge.  Went straight south in south karana and gave the bard the lute and
he gave me a note for cassius.

Headed east to the horsey people place.  Gave jarlehn 2gp and he gave me a
package of bread.

Headed north to north karana and followed the road, camoed, to east karana.
When I got to the ramp to highpass, I went to the left of the ramp (not up
it) and ran until I saw Milea Clothspinner.  Gave her the note from her
sister.  She gave me a veil.  I invised before the guard came and killed
her.  Sorry lady.

Went into highpass and turned in the mail.  Got the mail for qeynos and
freeport from her.

Ran into kith and into rivervale.  Got the mail for freeport there.  Ran
thru kith, west commons and east commons to get to freeport.  Turned in the
mail.

Gated back to qeynos.  Gave the clothspinner lady her veil and she gave me a
note for the cleric.  Gave the cleric the note and he gave me pp and a
bronze weapon.  Turned in the mail and gave cassius his note.  Returned the
empty stein to the pally lady and sold the bread to the muffin people.  Went
to surefall to hand over the statue from nessiff.  It took about 36 hours
game time to do.  I dinged level 6.  I made over 10pp (I think 16pp but I'm
not positive. Definately over 10 though.).  I had a blast.  I have no skills
to speak of.  Offense, defense, spell skills, weapon skills all suck.  A
blue skellie in front of qeynos removed my ass, gift wrapped it and gave it
back to me before kicking it.  I still had a blast though.

Oh yeah, since he's 6 and won't decay right away, I gave him all of my old
druid's stuff.  His wis is like 125.  I think I might take him to freeport
and get him bound there.  I haven't leveled any low players in EC yet and
I'd like to get into one of .those orc groups.

So there you go.  Probably the worst way to twink and level a character but
the world looks a little different when EVERYTHING is red.
