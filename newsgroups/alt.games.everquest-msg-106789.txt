No, this wasn't me /petitioning some jackass training or KS'ing,
thankfully.  But yesterday afternoon I was playing my monk in the
Field of Bone in the pit area and I wound up crashing to desktop (and
of course going link-dead).  I rebooted and logged back in, and when I
logged in, I found myself "under the world" where the sky was on the
bottom of the screen and the ground was on the top (this is also what
happens to mobs when they go through the walls in the pit, they go
under the world and turn invisible).  And since my character was a
monk, I couldn't just /gate out.

So I /petition "Help, I'm stuck under the world" (and not knowing you
had to explain your whole problem in one /petition, I tried to
continue explaining my problem by next /petitioning "I went link-dead
in Field of Bone and got stuck under the world" but of course I got
message saying "you can only have one petition at a time in the queue"
:-P.  

Anyway, from what I had read of other people's experiences, I thought
I'd have to wait at least two hours or more to hear from a GM, but to
my pleasant surprise, I get a /tell within about one minute from a
GM/guide named Generosa saying, "This is GM/guide Generosa, what can I
help you with?"  I then explained to her that I went link-dead in the
Field of Bone and when I logged in I found myself under the world.
She said to hang on and that somebody would help me shortly.  

Then about another minute later, I see a character named Santzar
standing right next to me; he turns out to be the other GM.  I hail
him, he hails me.  The next thing I know, I find myself back on the
path in Field of Bone near the guards, Santzar is next to me.  He
says, "There you go", I say thanks very much and /bow before him.

But anyway, after reading horror stories about people waiting hours
for a GM's response or having a GM be real rude to them, I just
thought I'd mention an encounter that was actually nice (of course,
there is likely many nice encounters that happen every day on EQ
between players and GMs, but people usually mostly hear about the bad
ones!)
