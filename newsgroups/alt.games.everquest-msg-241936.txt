I agree wholeheartedly! Not only do the various skies look great, but
the environmental lighting is awesome. A dawn, all of the trees and
the ambient lighting actually look like you would expect for that time
of day and delineation of the sun. That changes some time after dawn
to normal daytime lighting. The only thing I would like to see is a
more defined sun rather than just a somewhat brighter blurry spot in
the sky.

Additionally, the fog looks like it has been done really well in many
of the zones I've been in. They've changed it from just a simple
fade-out effect to more of a reduction of detail, followed by a fading
out of the silhouettes of objects, the farther away they are. It gives
it a bit of an eerie vibe in LFay, for instance.

I think that overall they've made a huge improvement. It really adds
to the atmosphere.
