That's just the supposed sort order.  Either alphabetical or lowest to
highest population at the moment.  There is debate whether or not the
population sort is accurate or not.  But it doesn't really matter, there is
only a few choices:

If it says "Zek" you can kill other players (if you want this choice there's
a sub choice I won't get into).

If it's "Role-play Preferred," which is currently only the Firiona Vie
server, it has a lot of special rules that don't exist on any other server,
and I believe you can only have one character on that server.

All the others are regular servers...the servers that the game designers had
in mind when creating the game.  They are PvE (player versus environment),
but it does allow for consensual PvP (player versus player).  There's damn
near zero reason to do PvP on a PvE server (no skill gains, no loot, no xp)
but it is an option.
