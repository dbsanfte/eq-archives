Yes, you're safe if you're outside the room.   Having the door open or closed
makes no difference at all.

(And before you ask, no you cannot simply pull MB out of the room so you don't
have to deal with the spider AA, he is leashed inside.  If he leaves the room
for more than a few seconds he will warp back to the center.)

The spiders never stop, whether MB is up, down or just died.   They will
continually spawn and walk to his room, where they explode for 4000 damage
each.

(And wasn't that a fun suprise the first time we found the room.   MB wasn't
up and we knew nothing about the event, so we just started wandering across
looking for somewhere to kill things, and *BOOM* four spiders exploded at
once.)

He is visible if he is up, but not targetable.   To begin the event, you just
start killing the spiders.  Once the spiders have not reached the room for
several minutes, you will be able to target MB.   (At this point if he is not
killed, he will despawn within 30'ish minutes.  Realisticly you will only get
one attempt)

It's the same gnome from the first room of the factory.  He will be up for 15
or 30 mintues, I forget which.  Or until he gives out 72 flags.
