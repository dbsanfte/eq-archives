When I am soloing, root is invaluable, has been for a very long time.  If I
am soloing with my pet, it allows me to keep the mobs attention on the pet
when I cast on the mob.  When I am root/rotting, well, can't do that without
root.  It is definately a hit and miss kind of spell though, it wears off
unpredictably.  Sometimes almost immediately, sometimes after some time.  I
can certainly see the arguments for why it is one of the most useful spells.
With all it's defficiancies, it does make a great last restort for parking a
mob out of the way under a variety of circumstances.
