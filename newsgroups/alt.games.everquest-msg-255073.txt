Actually, lock picking isn't all /that/ bad.  Just wait until level 45 and
get a KEI.  Then go into Befallen and work on lockpicking there.
Alternatively, you can go to the entrance to Paineel (the Erudite Heretic
city off of Toxx Forest) and pick the lock to the entrance.  It's not really
needed until post 50, when you're helping folks do epic pieces in City of
Mist, going into Howling Stones, or later on, getting in to help people get
their Sleeper's Tomb key.

One thing I really didn't like working on was sensing and disarming traps.
The skills are practically useless now, even in LDoN (where you find /at
most/ three traps), because most folks don't hunt in places like Dragon
Necropolis or much Chardok anymore.  I'd say put your points there just to
get the skill up in case you need it.

One last idea is to point skill points into making and applying poisons.
Farming components for poisons is time consuming, so it may just save you
some trouble later on.
