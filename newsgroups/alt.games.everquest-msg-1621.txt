If someone's 'primary' got an item, how can you say they had no part in earning it?
Doesn't the same person play the primary character as is playing the
secondary/twink?

If the rogue in question is the twink of a higher level character who has assisted
his guildmates in other endeavors, likewise he's not being unreasonable in asking
them to help him get his jboots.

Hey, you can leave your guild any time you want to, but they're probably glad
you're gone, with your holier-than-thou attitude.
