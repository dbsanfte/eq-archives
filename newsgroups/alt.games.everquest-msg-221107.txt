Don't!  If its not a spell level, and you do LDoN runs regularly, then
its likely in your best interest to save it for the next dungeon.  The
dungeon difficulty is based on average level at the time the mission
is given, correct?  Level in the dungeon after the difficulty is set
and you'll get a small advantage throughout the dungeon.

Just my 2 cents,
