well, depends on where you are with items and how much you store.  the 2
extra slots along with the added ability to hold almost any sized item in
them is a pretty big bonus.  Especially for those who adventure in places
like FFA loot rules, where you are only limited by the amount you can carry,
and walking away to deposit your gains is frowned on.

If you used it for the bank, you would have those many extra slots.

not super familiar with the toolbox, but with the new combine rules, it
might be more reasonable to use 10 slot items in bank besides the backpack.
You'd still have to be concerned if the "toolbox" or other combine item
would hold as big of items as the backpack.

remember thinking I was so smart when I found a 10 slot warrior quest item,
and used it to hold pages for research.  I decided of course never to hit
combine, so thus I could use it without spending the 100 plat on the
backpack.  because they were small, size didn't matter.  One day I hit
combine and lost all those pages.  Besides being a little peaved, I gave up
the stupid warrior quest container, and probably why i still use the 10 slot
backpacks today.

I can completely understand wanting to use the 8 slot evil-eye bag, because
of its weight reduction.  That also is very very nice to have.

Finally decided i was too loaded to not have close to the best buyable
container available, so broke down and bought the 10 slot 100 percent weight
reduction containers for 5250 plat each.  bought 2.  replaced my evil eye
back and my other 70 percent 8 slot backpack, which I gave to my lower level
chars.
