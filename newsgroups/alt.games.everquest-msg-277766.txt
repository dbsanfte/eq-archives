I don't think that would work.  If you increase the drop rate then the
drops will automatically be worth less real world money.  Same for plat
- if there's more plat then people will have less incentive to buy more
so its real world value will decrease.

That would work.  :-)

I imagine that they would not remove that charge to move the character
between accounts - it still costs them money to move a character from
one account to another.  They would just get a bit more money from the
commision from the sale (assuming that they intend to charge
commision).  Also, you could argue that this change will increase the
number of character transfers so generating more income for SOE.
