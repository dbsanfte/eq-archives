Hi all,

We all know that KSing happens. I have had two weird instances of it
over the last few days and would like to know what to do aside from
throwing my hands up (or petitioning the GM, SAME THING IN MY BOOK). I
frankly don't care if someone steals a pull by accident unless it is a
spawn I have been waiting five minutes or more for. Here are the
instances where of each incident, and I believe the first is
technically NOT KSing but still annoying.

1. Myself (level 52 Beastlord) and a friend (Level 30 Warrior -- ok I
am PLing him) are pulling Giants to an area by the front of the FM
giant fort, and proceed to kill the mobs. As the mob gets to 50% life
this idiot starts to join in uninvited and start whacking at the mobs.
Myself and my friend ask this person to stop but he explains that
since the mob is below 50% life my friend will still get the xp. I try
to explain that he is incorrect because if I hit the mob in pulling it
(and I am NOT grouped with my friend, but PLing him) and I reduced it
to 80% life then my friend must actually bring it down below 30% life.
Needless to say this same idiot continued to whack away when we kept
asking him not too, and in fact had KS'ed us 2 or 3 time. I sent a
petition to the GM, who replied to me over an hour later when I was in
KC in a group. He explained I must use /REPORT {target} and it will
send a copy of the last 10 lines of the dialog window. I ask him if he
could even say anything to this individual and he said there was no
way to prove it so no he couldn't. Then I asked him what a /Report
will prove, since all it will show is mostly us hitting a mob, and
this person may not even be in the dialog screen. WHAT USE IS THIS?!
Makes no sense to me. By the way this took place on Quellious, and I
will withhold the name of the idiot unless someone is interested.

2. Last nite I was in Dreadlands with my 45 Warrior, at the East
ruins, and there was a group of high level people from Adulti Soltano
a crappy guild on Quellious that were PLing someone, couldn't really
tell. Well we start pulling a mob, then this level 52 chanter from
that AS group mezzes it and steals it. This proceeded for about 10
minutes to a point where our group went over and simply fought the
pull in their area. Seriously if it was up to me I would have just let
well enough alone but then they start complaining that we are KSing!
Amazing. I was not the leader of the group, and had I been I would
have just let the first few go without saying anything, I think they
were feeding off us getting upset, I don't know.  Well having had the
experience I had above I immediately sent a /Report, GUESS WHAT
HAPPENED....

NOTHING!!!!!

What a surprise.
