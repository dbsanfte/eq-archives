Well, then you would be in the same position he was, wouldn't you?
Your 13 buffs plus the 2 the bard was singing, and I wouldn't have
been able to Celestial you either.

What really irritated me was the ranger's saying that he didn't like
Celestial (Celestial Healing, remember, not Elixir) anyway since it
didn't heal enough and he only wanted me to cast Divine Light on him,
which showed a complete lack of understanding of what Celestial is
for.  I'm damned if I'm going to adopt special behavior for a ranger
just so he can have some DS or something up, especially if he isn't
the MT (we had a perfectly good pally for that).
