A very good write-up indeed.  Having played a rogue for 3 years myself on 
the Drinal server, I would like to fluff out some things though. :)

Wood elf rangers (class trait) and non-rogue Halflings (racial trait) can 
also sneak/hide, but they max at a skill cap of 50.  Rogues' skill cap is 
200.  This allows them to get around most of pre-PoP mobs without a problem. 
Notable exceptions are assorted mobs in the old planes (such as liches and 
banshees in PoHate).

The Shroud of Stealth (SoS) Planes of Power AA increases the number of mobs 
that cannot detect a sneak/hidden rogue.  It is a passive AA that becomes 
active automatically when the rogue is sneak/hidden.  In regards to raiding, 
generally rogues with SoS cannot be seen (except in rare circumstances) 
until the elemental PoP zones.

There Chaotic Stab class AA allows for rogues to backstab from any angle, 
but it does only the bare minimum backstab damage.

Actually, evading is an agro reducer, not an agro remover.  An evading rogue 
will usually be given a message as to whether or not he has ducked out of 
combat successfully.  I've evaded and still had agro before.  It's still a 
great way to get agro back on the tank though. :)

The Escape class AA will remove agro completely.  And along with the SoS 
ability, this is a rogue must have.  If your group wipes and you're evading, 
the mob will still come for you.  You just die last.  If you escape, you can 
drag your cleric to another rezzer in zone and save the party. :)

Pickpocketing is detectable by "sentient" mobs.  I can still remember 
working on my pickpocketing skills back when I was camping the gnolls in 
South Karana.  If they caught you, they would actually say "Stop, thief! 
<<player name>>"  I've also been caught while working on my 1.0 epic by both 
the dark elf and dwarf rogue GMs that we have to steal from.  And they DO 
attack.  (Running away from 6-7 angry rogues is not an easy chore, I assure 
you!)
