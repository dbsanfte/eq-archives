Maybe a texture problem

I have a Geforce FX 5200 and had some animals (wolfs mainly) in game lose
pelts and run around looking like they were without hair - they were all red
with brown feet

Looked up solution under support on Sony website and they say the common
problem is textures for armor on character

Solution was to delete all texture files (.txc) from the main directory and
the server would reinstall them

worked for me
