After about 6 mos of not playing (due to the birth of me 2nd child), I am
interested in returning to play on EQ.

My character is a level 25 Wood Elf Ranger (presently on Luclin). Where
should I go and what should I do from my present location and level? What
changes in the game should I be aware of?

Appreciate any helpful suggestions...
