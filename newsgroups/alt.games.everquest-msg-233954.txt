It would be hard if they tried to do something like a rotation, but suppose
each Warrior who does not have aggro simply hits taunt whenever he can?
Whoever had aggro will have 5 Warriors trying to taunt it off, and it won't
take a long time for one of those 5 to get aggro.  Then it won't take long
for another to get it.  This should actually lead to a pretty good
distribution of aggro.
