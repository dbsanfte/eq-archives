FV and FM are dangerous, but I've run thru them quite a few times
with a naked and unbuffed (no SoW) Warrior.  The <only> reason a
Druid would have trouble is laziness.  You're not immune to ambush,
just good at avoiding it, but if you're on auto-pilot and run over
the top of a bunch of drachnids (they are Rangers, some are L30+,
Rangers get SoW and See Invis at L30) you can find yourself rooted,
dotted, snared, and being beat on by 3 mobs in a matter of a few
seconds.  Similarly, FM Giants see thru Invis/Camo, run at near
SoW speed, and hit hard enough that all they need is to stun once
to have a pretty good shot at squishing a Druid.  Also there are
quite a few casters wandering FM (goblins and others), SoW won't
help when you're rooted.  If you're cautious the only thing that's
gonna kill you is being deliberately trained while lagged, if you
assume you're invulnerable you're just begging for an unpleasant
surprise.
