I agree with DT that an addtional spell slot is not gonna happen.  The way 
around it is to get something that you always have up (like, say, root for 
a druid) as clicky equipment.  This functionally gives you an extra spell 
slot, should you need it, in all circumstances where you can wait for the 
generally longer casting time of equipment spells.
