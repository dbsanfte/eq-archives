Did you miss the point that he really doesn't give
a shit what you think, and is going to sell it
anyway, no matter how hysterical, high-pitched and
self-righteous your whining becomes?

And, anyone who really counts, such as Verant,
doesn't give a shit either.

It's like listening to some Christian right wing
loony complain about Eminem's lyrics, who doesn't
seem to realise what a great job he is doing
increasing the sales.

You have become the account sellers' best
advertiser.
