The boobs look like implants too. Too perfectly circular, too high up, and
stick straight out. Looks like a low end stripper job. But hey, big boobs
are good. No complaints here.

/agree with the big hands comments also. Same for the Kitty. Hands are too
big for a female. I'm assuming they are using the same hand model for both
male and female in the same race. If the programmer will now just subtract
20% on all dimensions from the hand model it will look good.
