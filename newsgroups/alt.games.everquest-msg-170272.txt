I agree. Unreservedly. Amazing describes it.

Actually I think Gimli was almost perfect. Comic relief, yes, but also
badass.

It was Gollum that stole the show, though. I've heard he will be the
first CGI creation to be nominated for best supporting actor.

Best movie I've seen since a year ago when Fellowship came out. Can't
emphasize just how good it was. :-) Only quibble was the strangely
weak portrayal of Faramir and, related, the odd change to have Frodo
taken to Gondor after all.
