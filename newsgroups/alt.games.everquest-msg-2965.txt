Your pet is an extension of yourself just like a weapon. All the damage done
by your pet is credited to you. If I remember right (people correct me if I
am wrong) you will take a minor exp hit useing a pet like the pet will share
your share of the exp I think 75% of your share of exp if grouped goes to
you and 25% goes to the pet. I have gotten exp with a pet without doing any
damage personally just sitting back medding while the pet does the work.
