I am hunting in OT with a chanter and i always try to keep my dark elf 
illusion up so the goons won't kill me.  I conned them once before and they 
were indifferent to me.  Last night was hunting but my DE illusion had run 
out.  Well someone trained the goons to the SF zone and they ran past me into 
the tunnell.  I quickly memmed my DE spell and cast it.  So everyone else runs 
away and I'm standing there all confident that I'm safe.  The goons come out 
of the tunnell and I quickly con them.  Says they glare at me threateningly!!! 
 So they run over and kill me.  Did they see thru my DE illusion?  Or why in 
the heck did they kill me?  I had an Earth Elemental illusion on when they 
first ran by me.
