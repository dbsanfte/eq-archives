Why would I do that? A buff that has a significant chance to prevent a
death isn't something I would refuse.

The specific situation. Asking for a 10 str buff when the only reason
you're so overweight is because you've been going crazy on the ffa
loot is a stupid request. Asking for alacrity over augment when the
difference between the two is the difference between me medding to
catch up or me slowing the mob is stupid.

Perspective. We're talking about fringe spells here, not heals.

If what they say is true then more power to them. If not, I will
endeavor to explain why its not true. I won't try to force them to
cast spells they don't want to cast, though. I very rarely drop that
low on health and have never grouped with a cleric bad enough to risk
an enchanter like that. I don't ask for symbol spells, I believe
unless you're raiding all reagent spells are voluntary from the
caster.

I know what is useful and what isn't of my own spells. That's the
requirement.

Keep it in perspective. We're talking about fringe case spells here,
not things like clarity or heals.

Frankly I do know what's best for my spells. And though it's not
relevant, there aren't many classes I haven't played enough of -
untwinked - to not know reasonably well what best is. Bard comes to
mind, I've never played a bard past 14 so my only experience is what I
see them do in groups. Magician and necro are others. Oh and
beastlord. But anything else, yes, I'll trust my experience to any
reasonable degree when it comes to whether or not I should use my own
spells on them.
