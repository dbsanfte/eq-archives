    Monks solo extremely well. Monks are quite well enshrined in the
endgame, all the more so with the flurry of MNK/BST weapons with ungodly
ratios that have popped up.

    The cycle is pretty clear: make it hard when top guilds are doing it
actively, then lower the difficulty (by never upgrading it again or by
actively changing things) once the top guilds have moved on. I can stand not
being on the cutting edge.

  Each ranger on the raid is one more person to pop Trueshot and unload a
bucketload of damage from outside melee range (positioning allowing, same as
with rogues) on the one important mob. Each ranger on the raid is (for a
selection of mobs) one more chance for the target to be slowed early by
Earthcaller, saving wear and tear on the shamans and cleric mana. Each
ranger on the raid is one more source of warrior-level melee damage, second
only to monks for damage output from all angles. These aren't minor roles.

    You've known for the longest time you aren't a plate tank, so trying to
not draw agro shouldn't be a problem now. As for acting like a roleplaying
ranger, well, ask rogues how "roleplayingish" they feel, or ask wizards
where the pointy hat models are in game.
