I came across this earlier, it contains some pretty good info on SoL and
the horse situation.

http://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/previews/sep01/luclin.html

By the way, I also saw SoL at ECTS, and, while the models look good
(I've only seen Vah'shir and Trolls, not the new humans), the zones I've
seen aren't a huge improvement on the existing ones. Then again, they do
look like they are a work in progress (for example, lighting appeared
unfinished, with many zones still having a washed-out look, without
shadowy areas). My biggest pet peeve is with the textures. The quality
of the individual textures is good, but the placement seems a bit
haphazard. I understand that with many players and tons of equipment in
the global file, local textures are at a premium, but there are ways to
make things like texture tiling and warping a bit less obvious.
