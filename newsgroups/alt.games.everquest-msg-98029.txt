I'll agree with FoB. Probably the best newbie zone in the game, and by
now I've played most all races. Everfrost, to me, is bad. Plenty of
mobs, but it's too darn dark and snowy and enless channels to get lost
in for most newbies. Frustrating. Misty thicket is a hell hole full of
everybody who wants to be a halfling dr00d. Avoid like the plague.
Paineel's newbie area is very fine for the first four levels, but they
you are stuck with Tox, so you should find a way out of there fast.
 
There are two on your list which I would have listed here, that made
(respectively) "good" and "worst" in your ranking. Innothule swamp was
the easiest leveling any of my characters had outside of my Iksar in
FoB. The bouncers are spaced around conveniently for safety, there are
endless mobs that are very well conned, and there's so few new Trolls in
the game (and half of them leave immediately for EC) that you usually
have the place to yourself.

Feerot is equally good for just about exactly the same reasons. (Of
course, I've not run a newbie around there since the CT changes moved
the old CT mobs onto the surface, so I'm not sure if it's been hosed or
not.)
