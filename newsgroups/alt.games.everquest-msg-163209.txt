I have a suggestion but you may not like it heh.  Spend some time 
scouting the pathing and there are a few spots in the middle of the zone 
that make great pulling spots.  We set up on a hill well off the zone 
wall when we exp there and the only adds we get usually come from me 
being stupid and giving someone a /loc to bring me a corpse to rez.  I 
don't use /loc for anything other than stuff like telling folks where to 
drag a corpse so can't tell you where to start looking, sorry.
