Guildie rogue had a willsapper the other day, I asked him wtf does a rogue
have a willsapper!!

He was checking DN for Zland, Vaniki popped, and nobody online in-guild
needed a sapper.

Anyway, this is the force they used to kill him (and said he dropped like an
orc pawn)

65 warrior, 65 shaman, 60+ bot cleric, 60+ bot cleric, 60 necro

The 60 necro had used his 65 rogue first time, but the mob was pretty much
staying at 100% health (big regen).  As soon as his necro unloaded the dots,
he went down fast.  (Dunno why the shaman didnt do the dots, and if the
effect would have been the same)
