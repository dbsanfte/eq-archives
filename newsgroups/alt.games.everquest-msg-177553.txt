Aye, and I've found me answers! Here be the truth, ye can swear by it!

Food / Drink
Snack / Whistle Whetter = 15 minutes
Meal / Drink = 30 mins
Hearty / Refreshing = 60 mins
Banquet / Lasting = 90 mins
Feast / Flowing = 120 mins
Enduring / Enduring = 150 mins
Miraculous / Miraculous = 180 mins

Force feeding (chomp, chomp) cuts these times in half.
Halflings cut times in half
Monks double times
Mounted characters consume much faster (yer horse will eat you out of house
and home)
