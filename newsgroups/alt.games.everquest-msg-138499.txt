> Plus, when she woke up, she
found some 59 or 60 necro spell for sale for 750 plat in an amazing
deal, so the baking nearly paid for that! (Lich or Demi-lich or somesuch
thing.

It was Arch-Lich- and so I think I'll skip Demi-Lich (also a 60 spell, but
easier to find) for 900. Other traders in the bazaar at the time were
selling to 5000pp and up. This has definitely been my best bargain so far. I
have a list of spells I need from here to 60, and I check it when I plug in
the trading mule and when I get up in the morning to see if he sold
anything.

Baking every day to save up for Emmissary of Thule, which I've seen for sale
a total of 8 hours for 75kpp.... (that's the spectre pet at 59).
