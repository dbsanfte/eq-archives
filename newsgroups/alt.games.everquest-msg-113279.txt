  Sometimes people just can't see beyond their own greed.  It may make all
the sense in the world to add somebody to the group, but "Oh no, then I'll
get 1/5 less experience per kill" or something.

  I'm always for adding another person to the group, unless the group is
already an overkill (or a friend is on their way, ect.).  It keeps the group
alive if someone has to leave, and even if it does decrease the group's
"experience points per hour" rate, it's still nice to have another person
and make another friend.  Maybe tomorrow the roles will be reserved, and
you'll be the one LFG and they'll be the one in the group.  It never hurts
to know someone in a group to help get yourself in it.
