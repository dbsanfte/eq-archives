Sounds identical to our guild's system. I left a guild that had a straight
bidding point system, and, just like the warrior you mentioned, it had
many flaws. The worst, IMO, was that the guild ended up with a bunch of
ok equipped warriors, not a one of which will be fit to tank most elemental
mobs, which is where my old guild is now. They still spend more time in
VT than the elemental planes though, but that's fine by us as it means
there's actually targets up when we're done with our 2 days in time.
