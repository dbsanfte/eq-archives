Now, if you are going to go an correct spelling and grammar, you know that
you are going to have spelling and/or grammar mistakes in your correcting
post, don't you?

The word you are both looking for is "cue".

I'm certain to have made at least one mistake in this post, feel free to
point it out if you must.

That all being said, I do agree with the sentiment of your post.
