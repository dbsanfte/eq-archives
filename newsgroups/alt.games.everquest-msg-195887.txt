Try getting it into windowed mode.  Once you're stuck on char select, I
haven't found a way out.  I ctrl-alt-del and kill the eq task (running XP).
Re-start the game and when it gets to the accept/decline screen, hit
alt-enter.  It'll kick into windowed mode and that (most of the time) frees
up the cursor.

No guarantees, but it usually works for me...
