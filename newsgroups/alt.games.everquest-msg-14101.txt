Well, I paid 58,000 yen, does that count? :-)

I upgraded from a ProphetII with 32mg ram to the ProphetIII with 64mg
ram.  I notice a big big difference in wakening lands, burning woods,
emerald jungle and trakanon's teeth.  Most other zones not much
different.  These zones used to slow down my framerate a bit, but not
anymore.

Also finally got rid of that annoying hiccup I used to get when zoning
in from Misty thicket to Rivervale.  Used to be the screen would
always freeze for a half second as I rounded the corner and the bank
became visible.  Don't get that now.

I'm glad I upgraded, but if I had had one of the geforce2's with 64mg
ram, I would have probably waited until the inevitible release of the
ProphetIII ultra.
