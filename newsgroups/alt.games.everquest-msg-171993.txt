Just saw Two towers again and was wondering if I heard right.The scene
before the battle for helms deep, Aaragorn is sitting and asks a boy his
name then looks at his sword telling him its a good sword.Did the boy say
his name was Halas and if so is it a coincident or do you think Verent used
the name for the barbarian village as a nod to the granddad of all mid-evil
fantasy?
