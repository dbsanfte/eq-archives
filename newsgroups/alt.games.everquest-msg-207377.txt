Embalmer's Skinning Knife from some mob in Tower of Frozen Shadow (or from
the Bazaar) comes close.  Its proc summons L/2 bandages (max 20), where L is
your level.  I bought one for fun and went out and attacked a Skeleton in
Nektulos.  Since my Piercing is only about 15, it took a while to kill it
(but no matter...the thing is so low level that my standing regen was
keeping ahead of its damage output).  By the time I finished that skeleton
and an add or two, I had 200 bandanges.
