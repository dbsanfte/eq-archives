First of all, your mana is for later levels. The 39 song, Solon's Bewitching
Bravura, requires 20 mana to be used. Then the level 43 song, Denon's
Desperate Dirge, uses 800 mana to be cast. The reason that you are able to
meditate, however, is to be able to scribe, and memorize songs faster.

At level 12, you get a direct damage songs that is vocal based called
Brusco's Boastful Bellow. At level 12 it is not alot of damage, but it is
decent, kinda like having another offensive ability like kick.

You must be very careful with Chords of Dissonance, as it is an Area of
Effect based song. You can get yourself into trouble with it by the song
attacking more Mobs than you might be ready for. Without a lute in hand, it
doesn't do very much damage, but it has a high taunt factor, so be careful
using it in tight places with lots of Mobs.
