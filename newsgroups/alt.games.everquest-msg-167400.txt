I did not put words in your mouth.  You referred to players having a
"right" in the context of the game.  I replied by pointing out that
SOE defines our "rights" in that context.  If you think that's putting
words in your mouth then it's safe to conclude that the remainder of
your defensive blathering isn't worth the time it'd take to read it,
let alone respond to it.
