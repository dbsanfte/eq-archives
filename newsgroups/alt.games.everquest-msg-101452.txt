Interesting article.  Wrong (totally wrong), but entertaining.  The fact
that bigoted racists who conjure up these inane "studies" to see how they
can humiliate and demean another race -- and get *published* -- is just
further proof that our country is going the way of the dodo.  Obviously
Pelley and the other ractist jackasses have way too much time on their
hands.

At any rate, welcome to the kill-file, Skeezix.
