Bingo. That was their first stroke of luck. The next step, however, was the
critical one and that was exploiting that stroke of luck and this they did
in legendary (and in retrospect, probably illegal) fashion. The OEM
arrangements they put into place requiring hardware manufacturers to pay a
per-box royalty, *whether the manufacturer actually shipped MSDOS with the
box or not*, was the single most critical business decision they ever made
and the one that launched the cash cow that made everything else possible.
At that point, it was impossible for any other OS to get traction since the
box makers were paying MS a royalty on every box anyway, and they weren't
about to pay twice. Brilliant move.

WordPerfect was *the* standard in the legal industry and had huge momentum
but it suffered the same fate as the other "unassailable" DOS standards
(Lotus, Harvard Graphics, et al): they were too slow moving to Windows. By
the time it became apparent that Windows was becoming the dominant platform,
MS Office was already well down the road to its own dominance.
