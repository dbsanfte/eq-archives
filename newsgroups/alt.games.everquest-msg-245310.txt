The bards I know both prefer pulling Ruj to any of the other themes
(on hard) but from what I've seen, the monks and SKs got owned pretty
hard pulling there. It's an admittedly small sample size (just now
getting started doing hard w/o a bard) but Mir seems to be the easiest
for them to pull. Very few casters and decent mob spacings even in the
big rooms. Also, I don't think anything enrages in Mir which makes mob
placement for pets less critical. 

It might have just been the luck-of-the-draw so far. I'd be interested
in how other non-raiders (that can't handle a 3 or 4 pull on hard)
view the difficulty. 

Rgds, Frank
