And I disagree completely.   The SoL models for Dwarves and Iksar look
stupid as hell.  And the Wood Elves all appear to be heroin addicts.  And
Erudites.... the dome... the dome...

Also the new models make your vision lurch in unfortunate manners while
doing melee combat... all that, and I still haven't even mentioned the
performance hit yet.

The only models I do leave on are human females (always hated the way they
looked) and both kitties.  Don't miss the SoL models at all.

Now if they would only fix the damn Velious armor graphics....
