or alternatively you can start eq in low priority so it CANT hog the cpu.
Set your shortcut to something like this...
%windir%\System32\cmd.exe "/c start /belownormal c:\everquest\eqgame.exe
patchme"

Note that yout cant change the process priority once eq has started.
(another of SOE's bright ideas)
