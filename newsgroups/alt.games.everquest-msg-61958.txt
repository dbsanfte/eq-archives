You'll be very happy with the upgrade.  With the MX400 I keep my clipping
plane maxed at the max resolution, only once have I had to adjust the
clipping plane down since I upgraded.  With the voodoo, the run from FV to
LoIO was terrible, the framerate was on the order of less than a frame a
second.  With the MX400, I don't notice a difference between that area and
any other area.
