My guildie, level 60 warrior, level 59 (or 58 I forget) enchanter,
level 54 cleric (again, I forget the exact level when he did this),
and level 42 monk.  Playing all four at the same time he cleared the
firegiants in SolB.

When asked why he did it, he responded with "I've always wanted to see
if I could do it."

Personally, 2 toons is my limit.  It's just too much of a pain in the
ass playing more than one character at a time beyond "muling" and
"taxing".
