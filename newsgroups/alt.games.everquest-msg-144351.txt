Hell, regulations existed before capitalism came about too. :P

Yeah, but regulation only has teeth with a strong State that can lay the 
smack down on the corporate monsters that *will* arise in any capitalist 
economy. I love the fruits of capitalism, but I want to be shielded from 
its worst excesses. If you don't know what I mean, remember Bhopal.

Yeah, that's what worries me too.

Put it this way: I trust private charities about as much as you trust 
the government. :)

To be perfectly honest, I fully agree with both of you there.

For myself, I can only say that I am astonished and somewhat terrified 
at the results of this evening's experiments.  Astonished at the 
wonderful power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so 
much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever.
