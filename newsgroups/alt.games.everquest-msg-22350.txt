lol all 8 of my chars on my main account started out in lower class
armor.....cloth.  They eventually went up the ladder to patchwork, then
leather, then banded. My lvl 45 Ranger was still wearing some pieces of
banded until my son took mercy on me and traded me his Ry'gor for an item I
had he really wanted..  All of my character have now graduated to middle
class, but no really uber stuff....and it will probably stay that way as I
have no real desire to go on planes raids and die needless deaths for a one
in 200+ chance of getting one piece of uber armor. My lvll 13 necro (on
another acct ) is still wearing a substantial amount of cloth armor, but she
does have a few good pieces as I believe highly in recycling items. :)

As you move up in level, you will learn there are places you can fight that
will reward you more than others...example, for a char in their late teens,
the bandit camps are a good source of money.  You can get bronze weapons
from them as well as bandit sashs. The bandit sashes can be turned into
Chesguard at the Paladin guild in S Qeynos, for bronze weapons, cash, and
best of all exp.  If you can collect several backpacks full of sashes, you
can make considerable change for your level. (I have made over 40plat a
time). You can then afford to buy better equipment.

But seriously, the main thing is enjoy the game.....that is more important
than any kind of armor...or anything else material wise.
