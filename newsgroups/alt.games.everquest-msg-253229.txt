     And I don't get how a thread that started with a truly bizarre tale
about a *faked death* focused instead on the rather mundane and common (for
MMORPGs) aspect of the gender switching.  I mean, is anyone in this group
really surprised to learn that female characters might actually be played
by guys?  I guess it's because there pretty much is no controversy about
the death thing, we all think it's messed up.  Still, its interesting to me
how newsgroup threads can evolve.

   As far as having a chance with an online "chick", well, a real physical
relationship is probably out of the question due to geographic concerns. 
But there is always the chance of online cybering.  I confess that I cannot
see the appeal of that particular activity, which is just as well.  If I
cybered, I know I would have been probably reported for accidentally doing
do in market or raid channels, given my near random channel selection when
I have enough conversations going.

   However, I've had several "online relationships".  None of them were
sexual in nature, but that didn't mean that I didn't make friends, whom I
enjoyed chatting with and hanging out with.  I don't think that adding sex
to the equation of a relationship, whether online or not, automatically
makes it dirty.
