Or because they have one bard and one SK and half a dozen monks.  I've
always laughed at the strategies, pull tips, etc., that say to use bards. 
The most bards I have *ever* seen at one raid was three (and we're talking
70-person raids in a Time-enabled guild).  We're incredibly lucky if we have
two.  Hell, we're pretty lucky if we even have one.  And the highest
attendance bard has absolutely zero desire to be involved in pulling in any
way.

And I can still outpull any bard or SK over the long run, though they are
definitely the best pullers for some specific pulls.  As far as "pet
pulling", there is a little known trick a monk can do that works exactly the
same (and another that works similar), and will take a helluva lot longer
time to get nerfed.  If you have to ask what it is, you just found out why
it will take longer to get nerfed.  =)
