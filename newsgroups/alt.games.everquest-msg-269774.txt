Ah I see. Well I disagree completely, and think they are each idiotic 
suggestions. Not everything that has value should cost extra.

And charging 75% the base cost for a nominal value add is even more 
ridiculous.

No. My point was they were ripping you off huge. 

However, if they'd released it with 50 slots for 13.45 instead of 4 for 
12.95 I'd have bought it by now.
