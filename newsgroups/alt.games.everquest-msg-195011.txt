James, 

  Thanks for an excellent writeup. My regular groupmates aren't quite
high enough to crawl into the zone yet. Lvl 60-62 just gets too many
resists for me to do root parking with any kind speed. Malo seems to
be a must on anything but the foul pusslings, and our tanks aren't
tough enough yet to handle 2 or 3 mobs beating on em while I malo,
slow and root park the adds. ... unless maybe we have our enchanter
online. Got a couple of comments, questions.

The Paffa event seems to be fixed, at least as of Sat. morning. We
tried it with about 15 people, wiped, and 15 minutes later when we got
back everything was back to normal. We didn't quite have the DPS to
handle it, 1 65 rogue and 2 65 monks and a 60 monk were the only major
DPS people there. If they'd kept spawning, I think we would tried him,
had an SK all set up to do a suicide run and train em away <g>. 

Is there anything past the paffa room, assuming he isn't up?

Any way to get past Carprin, train him out of the way, invis... ? We
usually have either a good suicidal SK or Monk (often both) along for
pulling.

Are the traps much tougher than the ones in Dragon Necropolis? If so,
probably not something we could handle, at least when our enchanter
isn't online. Our groups tend to be heavy on healing and low on DPS. 

Thanks again, I'd been doing AA since PoP came out and I hit lvl 61 to
let some friends catch up but now back to leveling at least to 63. If
we get a few more levels and can get the hang of CoD, looks like it's
the kind of place that we enjoy. Tough, not too crowded with decent
rewards if you're willing to take the risks. Exp doesn't seem as fast
as PoS but I'll take a fun dungeon crawl over boring single outdoor
pulls any day. 

Rgds, Frank
