Well now,
                First off, thanks for replying :), from what you said it
looks as though I should be able to sort something out.  As for blaming
Verant well, kinda yeah I do, I would have thought it would be a much better
system to use your CD key and credit card number or at least have the option
to do that.  No I dont really think its my fault at all, like I said I aint
played the game for 2 years, there have been rather more important things
for me to worry about :P.  I cant be expected to remember stuff like my
everquest account details after 2 years (longer actually), changing PC's,
moving houses, breaking up relationships, starting new ones etc etc, u get
the picture :).  I was actually surprised that my account was still there,
why leave an account fallow for so long?  also I *must* have cancelled the
account at the time since I have never been billed by them (its automatic
aint it? unless u cancel).  Using the cd key and credit card seems a like a
sensible option to offer to me anyway, but whinging aside thanks again for
ur response,

Paul.
