Hello Mr. Troll,

If you must really know, I even attempted eo edit the ini file
by hand and that still did NOT work.

Maybe you're challenged by editing decimal RGB values, but it's
well within my capabilities.  Since Verant provided these values,
it's reasonable to assume that you may edit them.

But, I guess that you're probably right -- as I'm sure you always
are in everything that you think and do, so I'm never going to
convince you that EQ wasn't handling LEGAL RGB values correctly.

And, since you're obviously a small-dicked asshole and you don't
have ANY of the facts, why don't you just fuck off and quit wasting
everyone's bandwidth with your worthless drivel.

Mike
