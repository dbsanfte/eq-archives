That's more or less correct. The real issue for most people was
getting rid of the big bad governor who couldn't figure out fiscal
restraint if it bit him in the ass. After that, it was a complete
blank. So people voted him out and then suddenly had to make a
decision: who to replace him with? They went for visibility and fame,
of course, lacking anything else to bite into. This wasn't a real
election where politics mattered. There was no real issue beyond the
money one, which boiled down to "anyone is better than who we have".

The circus atmosphere guaranteed everything going Ahnohd's way. Of
course, now he actually has to govern. We'll see how well he does.
