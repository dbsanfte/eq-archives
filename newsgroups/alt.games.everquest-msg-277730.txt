Hard to say, even if the new player actually manages to group with these 
ubertwinks at 1-20 (seeing as they usually solo, finding groups and 
talking to people just slows them down after all) they'll just rocket up 
along with them, to their own detriment ultimately.

If you -want- to be twinked up just join any of those crappy recruit 
anybody at any level guilds shouting in plane of knowledge. Once in 
you'll have to have an iron will to avoid being twinked up... maybe not 
to the same extent some of these uberalts have, but it will be 
"respectable". (If you can call joining a crappy guild for free loot 
handouts 'respectable')
 
> The standard has plainly been raised.

The reality is that new players really derive no benefit from playing 
with uberalts, and even less from becoming one of them buy begging or 
buying plat. They hit 50+ in a heartbeat and really know nothing about 
the game. Then their lack of knowledge and skill is a much greater 
detriment then their hp/mana pool size.

If a player starts a game like EQ thinking in terms of instant 
gratification to end game, they only ruin it for themselves and for 
those around them. Buy a MMOG with the -intention- that it take you 
several month to reach the high game and you'll be a better player for 
it, have more fun, and won't really suffer from not having bought plat.

Its only when you join up, rocket up to 50 in a week with a PL guild or 
leeching in PL groups on the CB-PC-OT-PoJ cycle, and find at 50th level 
you have only the gear you begged or got handed, and 200 plat to your 
name... that suddenly the game looks pretty bleak, and buying pp looks 
like your only way forward. 

But a properly played character who got around, spent time leveling, etc 
... he will know how to solo, what he can solo, where good cash camps 
are, what good bazaar farms are... he will have some quested gear, some 
dropped gear, and likely some gratis gear... but he'll know how and 
where to get more pp and gear on his own. He'll have goals, and a clue 
how to obtain them... he won't be stuck in the bazaar, flat broke, while 
simultaneously shopping unrealistic 70th level gear he finds with the 
search command.
