druid is the easiest class to start with? i highly disagree, there is no way
on earth that you can say that. a hybrid is the easiest to learn the ropes
with imo, melee, heal, stun/dot. depending what your hybrid class is. i have
a friend who made a druid and didn't buy any spells till the 25th lvl when i
told him he wasn't supposed to melee, needless to say, everyone of his
spells fizzled for the next 2 weeks and he quit his druid. all the time i
thought he was kiting around.
so according to this, there are mixed opinions on the easiest class to play
and it all depends how you like to play the game,
take it easy - cleric,
nearly have a heart attack when the cleric jus gets back from afk (w/o
saying) in time to ch you - tank
running away from scary mobs while killin em - druid
gettin someone else to do work for u while u heal him and still get solo
exp - beastlord
nuke like hell until the bastard thing dies - wizzie
buff people up and contribute to the fight while the people around you kill
the fecker, OR solo more-or-less anything in the game - shammy

everything changes, i cant be arsed writin out discriptions for the rest of
classes, coz im lazy, but u get the general idea and so will most newbies.
