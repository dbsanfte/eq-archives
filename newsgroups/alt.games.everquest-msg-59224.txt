Its been commented on before but they said no. The pvp servers are
there for PVP while the regular servers only have duelling or guild
wars. They don't want to introduce a PVP dungeon or zone into the game
because it makes it so you can't reciprocate and both participants
might not be willing:

Scenario: Bob is in the PVP zone or dungeon to get something for the
exact reasons that you say. Ted comes in only to kill people in that
zone, kills Bob then runs out. Bob can't reciprocate. 

That is the exact reason why verant also does not have a switch you
can turn on to kill someone, then turn off so they can't kill you. So
what you suggest will never happen as Verant has stated time and time
again.

Again, they covered it. Its all about reciprocation when a party does
not consent. A person would transfer to the evil server, gank some
people, then leave before they could get ganked. That is the exact
reason they made PVP servers.. so anyone who wanted to would have to
live in that world all the time and could eventually get ganked
themselves. It is also the exact reason why no pvp server character
can be transferred to a non pvp server; you must live with your
ganking and suffer the consequenses of unfair ganking and bad
reputations. Maybe I can say "ganking" more, GANK GANK GANK! ;)

Everything you said is one of Verant's largest "firm no."
