Oh.. so there's a difference? Never heard of 'regular' terrorism. What 
does the body count need to be to qualify for "way above and beyond 
'regular' terrorism"?Do YOU know how "coldhearted, selfish and narrow" 
that makes YOU sound??

True enough.. but then again I have NO say in other countries politics. 
What they do in their country is none of my concern. When it happens 
here it becomes my concern. THAT is my point.

If looking after MY interests and MY country makes me sound 
"coldhearted, selfish and narrow" are the way you see it then so be it. 
I never pretended to be an ultra liberal. I am NOT nor do I want to be a 
saviour for my fellow man. They have the same natural qualities as me 
... I've never collected welfare. Why should I pay someone else's'? If 
that makes me a bad person then again - so be it. I feel about the same 
as the $50 billion congress just gave to back the European Bank.

So do I. Neither do I. No, because it is NOT MY concern.

For the most part, yes. Would I be shocked and saddened? Again, yes. 
Would I want our government to help? Again, yes, if asked. Would I want 
my tax dollars to go to pay for it? Hell no, unless there were payment 
terms that I could be reasonably sure they weren't just going to be 
"blown off".

You're welcome.
