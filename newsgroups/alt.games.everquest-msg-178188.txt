My point is still valid and as you mentioned each class will get some spells
at various levels.  If a WIS caster gets it, the level will say 14, if the
INT caster gets the same spell, it will say L12... this can be confusing for
newer players.

As for melee's types and bind, you mean I dont get spells, ever? Really?
