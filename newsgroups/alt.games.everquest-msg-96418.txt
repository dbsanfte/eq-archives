Well, I had EXACTLY the same thing happen to me last night!  Couldn't go
into houses, tunnels, anything enclosed without really loud feedback.
Interesting to hear someone else had it too, my wife didn't and I assumed it
was my comp.
 * I restarted my comp after no other settings affected it, and it was gone.
Hope it goes away that easily for you, that was an excrutiating sound!
