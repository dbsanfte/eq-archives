You have more chance/easier time killing a WW dragon (e.g yeldema) then you
do of
a) even finding drusella alive in the first place
b) fighting all the way to her, then splitting the room/killing her

Drusella is a very highly contested mob on most servers (from what I can
make out) because of the chardok quests.

Well we got our asses handed to us by the scalekeeper last week.

We fought down to master yael, 2 x manaburn, all melees disced (primal
monk/warrior/rangers) and he dropped inside 2 seconds (give or take a
second)

Then somebody suggests we pull scalekeeper right after, needless to say we
were pwnt fast.

No chanters, no discs, 1 warrior, 2 clerics, both wizards oom (excuses
excuses huh :p) but it was still a really shitty ending
