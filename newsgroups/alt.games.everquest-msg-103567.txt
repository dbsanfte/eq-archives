Yes and no. If you think that their requirement to join the guild is to not
have a full time job (or one that doesn't interfere with their raid times)
and that they raid 6 times a week, and you have to attend atleast 5... I am
sorry, but I don't have a lot of respect for people who throw away their
life on a game. Guess that is why I am not FoH material... that and that my
highest level is "only" level 55. ;o)

Solitude :o)
