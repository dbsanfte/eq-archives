I disagree. It's no secret that some people here have endured a lifetime
of bullying and humiliation in the real world. This epitomizes most of
the original EQ crowd as they left the Dungeons and Dragons paper games.
It's not that hard to tells those apart from those who flames for a
reason. Many geeks hit the internet seeking revenge against the
stereotypical profile that has humiliated them in real life. Of course
with the protection of the monitor between them. These types are the
same ones that call in abuse complaints and cry because someone isn't
affected by their geek flaming attempts.
When I got EQ a guy that work for me said his cousin played and ask if
he would like for him to come show me the game. When the guy arrived he
met the exact stereotype of the average EQ player. Geek+nerd unbound. I
could tell he was uncomfortable with me.
Now for me, I am the same mean and somewhat impatient with stupidity guy
in real life. I don't use the internet to make friends nor do I seek the
approval of the typical internet geek.
I also call anyone's bluff. Feel free to post pictures of yourselves and
prove me wrong.

Me
