I'd not even touched on that in my post.  I *wish* they'd make locks and
traps more useful and interesting.  Once when I first went into CoM, a raid
was missing their guild rogue and I was offered 50pp just to sneak to the
back and unlock the door.  I turned it down because it was fun sneaking back
by myself to them through all the reds.  I opened the door and there was a
nasty Black Reaver not even aware of my presence.
