Using that logic, then wouldn't it be just as acceptible to begin referring 
to the tree houses in Kelethin as "scrapers", short for sky-scrapers? They 
are very tall built (the habitation areas anyway) structures, after all. 
Maybe not a very creative example, but I believe it would be just as 
correct as the use of the term "toon" in this case.

Either way, a person might know what I meant, but why not just call it what 
it is, rather than come up with a different, less correct term for it?
