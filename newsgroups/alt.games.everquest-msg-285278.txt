this is from the EQ2 forums

Murkle spawns in the same room as Crazy peepers. From the merchants, go
straight and it will lead you to a one-entrance room with four groups of
crazy menders. Murkle and Crazy peepers both spawn in this room. Kill the
menders to cycle the spawn.

Grimosh is in Edgewater drains. He is past the scourge rats, in the
'reclusive' murkwater spawn.

I've spawned crazy peers around six times, and murkle 30+ .. They are there,
it just takes awhile. And yes.. you can have up to four murkles up at one
time in that back room. It's odd. (:
