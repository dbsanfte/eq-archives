Was just camping forest giants in warslik woods.And they dropped a couple
axes a flattener and hammer (that was good enough to actually use).I asked
if they were worth any thing and was told they were vendor loot.So I sold
em' ,each were 10p chaching!!(at least for me at 24).It reminded me of the
first time I sold bronze weapons I got off of dervishes.I had to smile.
