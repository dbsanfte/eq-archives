Well, quitting a game is far easier than moving overseas.  Expressing 
frustration may not mean you quit today, no, but you might quit soon... 
and when you do, I know a few little twinks that could really use the 
extra junk. :)

'Can I have your stuff' has become a traditional response to 
expressions of frustration in this newsgroup.  Almost traditional enough 
for us to acronymize it, really... so from now on, I propose that we use 
'CIHYS' to intimidate new posters with our in-group obscurity.  It's part 
of the tradition to promulgate the clearly baseless belief that the first 
peson to ask will be awarded the 'stuff', regardless of whether we happen 
to be conveniently located on the same server, or play the same class, or 
whatever.

And this time, I was first, so nyah nyah!  rcsmiley should have enough 
stuff by now anyway. :)
