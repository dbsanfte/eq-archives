I believe the eqloader scans all files in the eq directory to check for new
patches each time you start it.. It will probably check crc or similar of
the files, to verify that there is no newer files updated from the server..

Try editing one of the files with a hex editor to check what happens.. (But
dont blame me if you get banned cos they think you try to cheat.. lol)
