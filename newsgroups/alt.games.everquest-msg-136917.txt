I did level fifty on the wyverns and only hunted the birdbrains when CS
was over camped.  Go fixy your dragon faction. You wont' regret it. It
will be well worth it later in the game.

Just go hang out at the entry to Kael on a weekend and look for a raid
that's forming up. Politely ask if you can go along and help just for
faction. Odds are they will let you.

A couple hours in the arena will get you out of the dumpster with the
dragons.
