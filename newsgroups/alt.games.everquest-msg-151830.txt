I am still only 54, 50% rez is <not> popular amongst the post-50
players, heh.  Next level I get 75% rez (I think it's 55 anyway),
which is still sneered at but looks a lot better to the desperate
than 50%.  At 56 (or is it 57?) I get Sup. Heal and might actually
be able to keep another tank alive in a "real" fight for a while.
Greater Heal (300hp) is of only very limited use in a fight at
this point, some fights it's as useless as a Ranger's 100hp heal.

I have made no effort to speak of towards getting my epic, and as I
follow Mith. Marr, Nature's Defender is not an option.  If one of the
bottleneck dragon books falls into my lap before I get a weapon
comparable to or better than the epic I'll call in every friend I've
ever had and favor I've ever been owed to try to get the other book
(or arrange an MQ) and then do the other pieces.  But I simply did
not have a playing schedule that allowed me to make more than the
occasional Vox/Naggy raid so I never even went to one of them (I'd
probably still be around #10 on the lists for books and still be L52
had I bought into that mindless treadmill mentality).  Frankly it
looks lots easier to get a good weapon by other means.
