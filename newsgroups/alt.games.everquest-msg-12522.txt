Nope - PURE level comparison.  That's why a blue WAR mob can still kick the
butt of a soloing ROG, and I've even had to flee from a green caster.

I noticed that somewhere in the high-20s the /con messages changed.  I
rarely see a high green (could pose problems) anymore, and the low/med/high
blues are GONE.  Blue means nothing anymore since it no longer gives me a
semi-accurate view of how much of a chance I have.  I could still solo what
would have been low-med blues, but high blues (face-to-face) cause me much
grief (and some grieving); I just have no way of know *which* blue they are
anymore.
