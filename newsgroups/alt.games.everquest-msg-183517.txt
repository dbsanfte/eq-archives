With a level 30 enchanter illusions and faction spells you can see just 
about everything if you went with Agnostic instead of a religion.

As for sights, The front entrance to Kaladim (Dwarven city) is really 
cool. Neriak (the Dark Elf city) is also on the must-see list. 

If you have Velious I would also check out Thurgadin and Skyshrine as 
those two cities are most impressive as well. Plane of Growth is another 
spot that is awesome in Velious and if you are a good race then you can 
run around in there with impunity.

Not a lot to see in Kunark unless you are higher level and can kill 
dragons, although you should go to Dread Lands and go to the snow 
mountains and hunt around for the White Dragon there. She's a pretty 
sight to see.

I can't offer any ideas on SoL because I just got that when I restarted 
after a 2 year absence and I'm only level 10 now so I can't go to many 
spots. 

In PoP the Plane of Knowledge is an interesting place to visit.
