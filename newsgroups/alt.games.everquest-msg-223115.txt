SK selects targets, cleric lulls as needed, SK pulls with FD in case of 
surprises.

Then Sk tanks, mage pet (and SK pet?  We'll have to see, some SK refuse 
to use em while pulling) chews up mobs while cleric keeps SK alive, mage 
uses DS on SK and nukes as mana permits to speed things up.

Cleric also available to root park adds, which is very sadly lacking on 
a mage.  SK has snare to stop runners, and is probably using it anyway 
as cheap hate generation.  SK can FD and pet tank if cleric's mana runs 
out too soon.

We're both high enough level to get KEI now, and its duration is longer 
than the duration of a LDoN run.

So yes, its quite possible for us to do the LDoN missions.

Succeding may be another story.. probably we'd Need KEI for a shot at 
that with our gear level, but LDoN exp and loot are some of the best in 
game at our level, and running around killing is more fun that camping 
mobs in place.

Whats missing?  No slow, no haste for SK (whats the longest duration 
haste he can get pre 45?  At higher levels there are some pretty long 
duration ones he can get I think, sort of like getting KEI for us), 
limited CC... and our DPS isn't too impressive either, unless Lenny's 
got some uber weapon I haven't heard about.

What would help?  Hmm, Muzzle for my pet, thats 10pp or so in bazaar, 
haste item for him to add more DPS.  Donals Arms for you, clicky valor 
you can keep up about 1000hp per minute in free heals for Lenny assuming 
he can survive without Temperance.  DS potions for Lenny but thats 
expensive since their duration is short.  Better weapons for Lenny. 
Hmm, missions that involve summoned mobs, so I can provide proccing 
weapons for the pets.  Loads of Cha gear for Teapray since biggest 
disaster we will face is failed lull combined with failed cha check: 
room aggro will be very bad, no CC, no evac, not even SOW(SOS really) 
unless we also make a point of getting SOE before going in (SOW duration 
is short enough that it will run out before we are half done)

But more than that, a fourth person, pretty much any class, perhaps 
excluding a warrior.
