Hello all, I know this has been asked before but I can't find it, and I
already know this make me lame.  ;)
Anyway, what's a good spot for a level 30 troll shadowknight to hunt solo
for money fairly easily?  I'm just looking to upgrade my weapon and take a
break form the xp grind, so all I'm looking for is good cash hunting at the
moment.  Any suggestions are very much appreciated, thanks especially for
your patience if you've already aswered this before.  Oh and I have all
expansions up to luclin, if that helps.

thanks again!
otherChris
