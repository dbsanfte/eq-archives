When I observe people doing this on purpose, I like to kill the mobs for them
anyway, first casting atone for their protection... I mean, what if root breaks
and they are still on the hate list?  Nope, I'd better clear that off.
Unfortunately,
that means I get the exp for the kill, even though the "let someone else finish
it off
for me" kiter did much of the original work.  Oh well.

Note: "on purpose" is certainly a judgement call, but a second time in ten
minutes
is a good clue, as is any incedent of rooting something next to medding people,
or training it back and forth across them in the apparant hopes it will rub off.

Also, using /y is, to me, a clear liscence to get the exp and loot if I can...
although
in this case I usually don't bother with atoning if the person seems truely
outmatched.
