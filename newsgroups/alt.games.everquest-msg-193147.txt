   The Scene: My nephew Tommy's Wedding Reception 

Place: The Grand Ballroom of the Emerald Plaza Hotel in San Diego

Time: Fifteen years from now.

   Tea (speaking to Bobby, a seven year old cousin): Stop staring
at me, kid, it's rude.

Bobby: I'm not touching you.

   Tea:  I didn't say you were.  Stop staring at me.

Bobby: Does it bother you?  I'm not touching you.
 
   Tea:  Yes, it does, now stop staring at me!

Bobby: Does it bother you?  I'm not...

   Tea (rising out of her chair with a great wail) Stop it, stop
it, STOP IT, STOP IT, STOPIT STOPITSTOPITSTOPIT.............

Bobby, and the rest of room: Stunned Silence

   Tea (pushes over the wedding cake and champagne fountain)
"STOP STARING AT ME!  OH GAWD, SOMEONE, MAKE HIM STOP! (deep
breath) AAAAAAAAUUUUGHHHHHHHH!

   (Chaos breaks out as Tea tries to stab out everyone's eyes
with a salad fork)

Annie <--- Hope she doesn't ruin her dress.
