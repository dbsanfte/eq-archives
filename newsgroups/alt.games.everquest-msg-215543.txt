You have to succeed to get the adventure points (at the very most, in
the 30 minute "reduced reward" period). That's simply would not be
possible to do solo.

I really believe that the 4 person minimum isn't so arbitrary. From
what I've seen, the mobs don't scale based on the NUMBER of people in
the group, just the level range of the group. The 4 person minimum, I
believe, is the minimum that they feel it is realistically possible to
complete the mission with.
