I would like to change the face on one of my characters (a gnome warrior),
but when I try the /face command i get the message: 'This command does not
work for the pre Luclin PC models.'

I have every expansion pack, including Luclin and PoP.  Is there something I
have to set to get the 'post Luclin' models???
