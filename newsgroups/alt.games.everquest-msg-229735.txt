Unfortunately, all previous experience with SOE up to now would indicate
that this means the recipes are either broken or not actually in the
game however much they might think they are. There's some absolutely
fanatical tradeskillers out there who will spend days combining odd
ingredients looking for recipes, and the new "this item is for
tradeskills" flag made their job even easier. I'd be very surprised if
there were even 10% undiscovered, 50% is basically unbelievable.

At least with alchemy, making the recipes available only 5-10 points
above your level will make the new feature fairly useless for skill ups,
though still convenient for mass producing potions for sale. The sell
back on alchemy is so miserable, and the price of components so huge in
some cases that it's much cheaper to make things 50 points over your
level. titan potions are the most common example, most do them at 120 or
so even though they trivial around 190 or so, because anything lower
costs about three times as much, and the resell rates on potions
compared to components is about 5% of cost.
