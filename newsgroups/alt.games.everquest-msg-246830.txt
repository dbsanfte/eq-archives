Yes, that's exactly it.  They require you to not just start up IE and use 
it (which is fine, by itself), but also to turn ActiveX crap on (which 
would be removing the lock).  The fact that you only had no lock on your 
door for two minutes and promptly reinstalled it afterward is going to be 
a very small comfort if someone broke in during those two minutes.

}They don't require you to switch browsers.

True.

}They don't require you to turn off your good sense. 

False.  My good sense tells me to never, ever use the buggy, security 
flawed, POS that is ActiveX.

}They do, unnecessarily we've already agreed on that, require you to use a 
}lame browser for 2 minutes. 

Ah! I'm glad you agree it was unnecessary.

}After that though we don't have to leave the house unlocked or cut or 
}phone lines or shoot out our windows or anything.

True.  But that may in fact be too late.

Consider that 1 in 1000 figure we were kicking around a few posts back.  
Now consider the number of people putting in beta apps who had their 
security properly tuned, and had to turn it off and back on again.  
Given... what is it?  400,000 active accounts?  Say 10% had their security 
properly set up with ActiveX off, and 10% of account holders applied for 
the beta... those are probably very conservative estimates.  That's 4,000 
people who had to turn their security off and back on, taking that 1 in 
1000 risk.  So by doing it that way, Sony probably jacked up at least 4 
people's computers, and made them waste half a day reinstalling 
everything.  Sure, 3,996 people were lucky.  But it would suck to be one 
of those 4, given that there was absolutely no reason for it, and they'd 
tried to take appropriate precautions to prevent that.
