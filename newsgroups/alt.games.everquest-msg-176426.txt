I can't recall Bandaging going up from an attempt at over 50%, but then
I am usually careful to avoid wasting band-aids with the characters that
use them.  I would not be surprised if it works tho, I can tell you that
I've received a Foraging skill-up while sitting (i.e. I got the "you
must be standing to forage" message and the skill-up message from the
same attempt).
