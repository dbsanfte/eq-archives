Of course, as would be expected.  However, I think retroactively applying
those content changes lays far afoul of that disclaimer.  Changing content
is "ooh, that's a bad idea, we're no longer offering this deal," not "never
mind, we're not offering that deal and we're taking back what we traded
for."  This is a bit more than just a content change, in my view.

Not on the box, but the values were known in-game, were they not?  I'm not
talking about information and decisions at the time of purchase.  I'm
talking about in-game decisions that SoE asymetrically reversed.  If I
decided to trade my Sword of the Morning for twenty gajillion tribute
points, and SoE decides to retroactively change the point values, am I not
entitled to a refund of the SoM?  I traded it for twenty gajillion, yet
SoE's only paying two hundred now?  Hell, in real life, that would be fraud.
Yes, I know this isn't real life, but the idea remains.

And, no, I'm not going to seriously suggest that this was all just a slick
ruse to get people to sell high-end items for tribute values they normally
wouldn't have.  That's a bit more cynical than I can go.

Heh, watch a bit more of FMA, then you'll forget all about Inu Yasha (and
yes, I have a Vah Shir Shaman named Neko Yasha... made her on the first day
Luclin was released, when the IY manga was still a luxory of the otaku).
