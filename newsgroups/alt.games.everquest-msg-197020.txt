After 20, you might be ready to take out Golras on the iceberg in south part
of Timorous Deep.  They'll con red to the level 21 Warrior.  All are single
pullable.  If you have the iceberg to yourself, they should provide good
experience up to level 29 (even past that if you want).  The Hulking Golras
are much tougher.  The Cleric can probably solo them, but I'm not sure at
what level it becomes productive for even a PL'ed warrior to fight them.

At 29, you can go to the Basilisk Caves in JaggedPine forest.  There are
several caves with non social Basilisks and Basilisk Genitors.  All should
con red to the warrior at 29.  The Genitors are more powerful and more
aggressive, but both types have a pretty small aggro range.

Nurga might be a good place, but I'm not sure what level to go there - maybe
34 or so.  I've gone in by a way that leads to a room with three gobbies,
then a passage, then a big room with more gobbies.  The Cleric should be
able to pull singles.  Your problem will be getting in through the entrance
in Frontier Mtns without either the cleric or warrior having invis.
