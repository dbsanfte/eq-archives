That's a good thing, not a bad thing.  The game is about adventuring,
not auctioning.

Oh, as if they do now.  The high level farmers in a zone are typically
stuck way in the last room, paying absolutely no attention to anything
going on elsewhere.

I hope you're not one of those people who think anyone below level 50
is a newbie...

This is very true and is your one valid point, IMO.  But there's
really not much of a change in the status quo.

You're right, I think, this is your number one reason, and the number
one reason of many posting in these threads.  It isn't a terribly
admirable one, you know.

You apparently believe that the fact that you're 55 or 60 or whatever
you are gives you the *right* to go anywhere in the game and grab any
piece of loot your little heart desires.  Never mind whether you're
fighting something even remotely challenging -- "I'm effin' 55 and by
God if I want that Helmet of Swollen Head I'll take it!  Stand aside,
noobs!"

In Asheron's Call many dungeons are restricted by level.  Once you
pass the upper limit, sorry Charlie, you can't go there anymore.  

Being level 60 gives you no rights.  It gives you the *ability* to
face the toughest mobs in the game, that's it.

>P.s . Its also very true that there isnt a problem to begin with .

Sure there's a problem.  Dungeons are very underpopulated.  People
cram into safe-leveling zones like Omen and Overthere.

Now.  All that said, I don't really think the TCC will do much to
ameliorate the problem.  The problem is much more with poorly designed
dungeons than with farmers.

But there is a problem, farmers DO exist, and TCC might help a little.

Obviously, No Drop quest items that a high level needs should not be
put in these zones.  But if Runnyeye, say, were Warrens loot rules and
some upper level had to buy a BA Medallion from a mid-level, I see
absolutely nothing wrong with that.  You have no RIGHT to camp
whatever loot you want, no matter what level you are.

Well, then we're even.  The only reason I see for complaining so
bitterly about TCC are greed and envy.
