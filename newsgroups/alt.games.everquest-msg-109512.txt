Sure I could, but having the answer readily available means I -can- just 
tell them the answer, and I very much enjoy being able to help someone in 
this way.  It's usually a friend asking... I like helping my friends.  

There's at least one member of the guild who has crowned me with the 
title, "Bible of EQ" precisely because I tend to have a ready answer to so 
many of the trivial questions that get asked.  I really enjoy that 
repuation, even if it's not wholly deserved, given how badly I suck at 
price checks. :)
