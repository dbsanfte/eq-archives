I am not debating whether or not more bugs will be found by making
something public, of course more will, as you just increased your pool
of testers by a factor of 100s if not 1000s.  That doesnt change the
fact they SOE doesnt test enough.

I dont play on the Test server just to be clear.  I do occasionally
visit some forums and read what people that do play on the Test server
have to say.  A trend I have noticed is that often bugs/balance issues
are found on the Test server and then are summarily ignored.  You can
also see from simple Lucy checks that code is often placed on the Test
server one day, and then made live the following day.  Are you still
taking their side?

The really unawesome thing is that they dont appear to have *any* paid
testers.  That sucks and is inexcusable for a product of this size and
scope.  They also dont seem to have content creators who consult with
each other as mob drops and quest and encounter risk/reward are wildly
imbalanced.
