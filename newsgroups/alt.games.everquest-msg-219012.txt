As a cleric I never really noticed the difference between shaman
and enchanter slow, although the difference between a shaman slow
and a 50% slow off a weapon proc was certainly palpable, it only
really mattered in POP.

I'm trying  to follow your math though, and I'm goint to do
something that lets me see it easier.  Instead of 300DPS, 100DPS
(yes, its a slug of a mob, so sue me).  Shaman slowed, it does
25DPS, Chanter slowed, 30DPS, BL slowed, 35DPS, 50% proc slow 50
DPS.

So shaman slow is twice as good as that proc slow, but only 20%
better than chanter slow, 40% better than beastlord slow...

Something about that doesn't seem right, it looks like its only
5% better and 10% better (and 25% better than the proc).

Lets see, how about its 14% better than 65?

Clearly there's something funny going on, but I've been pounding
swords out too many days in a row to be able to think it out.
