As a warrior, I'm finding myself in much the same situation.    I'm halfway
through 62, and I've still yet to find a reason to level...  not even the
spells that other classes get.   61 and 62 have both provided very, very
little in the way of character improvments.    At 61, I gained about 57 hp,
and 1 point of level damage bonus on my main hand weapon.   At 62, about 57
more hit points.

The only thing I really seem to get for going to 65, is the ability to buy
higher level AA, which I don't have enough points to afford anyways.   I
guess there might be some inherent level bonuses, like defense or a new
damage table (I know rogues get one at 63)...  but I've yet to hear of any
of them myself.

I've stayed pretty steady at 50 or 60 percent to AA...  now I'm currently up
to 70, and I'm seriously considering cranking it to 100 if I'm not into a
Tier 2 plane by the time I'm about to hit 63.

I can't even take a short break from the three zones we're currently stuck
in, since the old world went light blue so fast.     At 62, three out of
four Krups in Sebilis were light blue.  Not to mention that my favorite new
zone, innovation,  is about 20 to 25 percent light blue in the one area of
the zone that we can reach at 62.

We almost got into the Factory area of Innovation, at least.    Killed the
dragon.. but a dumb shit necro nuked the gnome and killed it right before
the dragon died.  So nobody got the flag, just a few caster weapons.

(And please, don't tell me how easily I can get past the trials.   Execution
we've almost made it a couple times, but when the line gets up to 9 groups
taking turns, it's just insane to wait an hour doing nothing for each
attempt...   Lashing we made it to the second round, but it either was
bugged or they changed it to be harder than when my friends in another guild
got through.   Twice we've made the second round, but the mobs for the
second round popped while the first round ones were still alive.   Which,
according to allakazams, is not possible.)
