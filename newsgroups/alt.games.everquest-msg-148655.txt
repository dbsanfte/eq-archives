With a two level advantage over a warrior, I had no trouble landing Blinding
Luminesence, followed by Malosi, Root, Nuke.  Refresh blind and root as
needed.  I am not a PvP player by any means, and neither was she, so she did
not come prepared to remove magic effects.  We did have an agreement of no
DoTs.  The fight was still very close, as I canned down to 20%, and she
still had a sliver of life left.  We both had DS potions (Yes, I made them
for her).  So, I had to go in and melee her to death at that point.  I ended
the fight with 50 or so hp, and completely oom.  I'm sure there are plenty
of stragegies that both of us could have employed to do better.
