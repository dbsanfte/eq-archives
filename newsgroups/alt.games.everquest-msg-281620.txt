Problem is, no-one knows at the moment.  People do the quests and
didn't even have an idea what the reward was in the long run, because
all that's mentioned is the Admission Ticket.

The mission is a blast though, with a not shabby shield (30ac, misc
stats and 130hp/mana, all/all).  Three waves of undead attack
Rivervale from the Kithcor side, storming the tunnel.  The party play
what appear to be puppet versions of Tunare, Cazic and so on.  We
defended it with 4 for the first 2 waves (1 guy got lost, yet you only
spawn 30 yards from the tunnel, heh) but he got there eventually and
we handled the 3rd wave with 5 of us.  I missed out on the Shield, but
at least I can say that, as Cazic-Thule, I got spell off that hit for
100k, wiping one of the Named mobs in one go, which will be a fond
memory  :)

Pity most of my abilities got resisted virtually all the time, but
that one was a doozy of a hit.  Nice tank, too...
