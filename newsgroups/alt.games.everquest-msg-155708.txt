I group with friends and guild mates just about 100%, I am not
complaining or anything. I just seemed that the rate of exp per kill
severly dropped after I hit 33 then it was at 32.. dunno... anyone
have any suggestions on where to go rather then OT or DSP? The people
I group with are always up for new and intersting places to try. So
far we have done HHK, OT, FM, DSP, MS and so on... if anyone has
anyother suggestions I am all ears!

TIA!
