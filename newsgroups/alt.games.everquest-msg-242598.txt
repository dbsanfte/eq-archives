I downloaded the wrong video.. the first one I got was 240mb and took 10
mins, then I bothered to RTFForum and found the right one,. took 5 mins to
get the 140mb ver.  ..anyway

I try real hard to not like anything about eq2, I dont wanna get lured into
buying another game that requires a time sync this big, and I gotto say,
this video didnt appeal to me. however.. I DO kinda wanna kill that
snake/skull combo looking thing at the end of the video now:(


another thing, I dont really follow eq2 forums very much so im kinda
curious.. I saw a screen shot of a 'kerran' or some sort. is that the new
vah shir model? cuz.. had I been interested in the game that is definately a
deal breaker for me. my fav thing in the world (of eq) is the current vah
shir models, the orange tiger and white tiger inparticular.
