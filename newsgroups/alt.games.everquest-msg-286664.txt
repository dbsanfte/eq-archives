Having an opinion is great.  Rehashing the same stupid bashing ("I
have a brain") is just tired.  It's an opinion, it's just an
unoriginal one.  My return to EQ has been severly dampened by the
simple fact that it seems like most of the people still playing are
simply elitist dicks.  There are plenty of friendly people, but so
many are so eager to just jump all over people and attempt to appear
superior.

Look at this newsgroup.  Near-flatline the entire time I've been
reading it, until an opportunity arises to jerk people around.  Now
we've got dozens of posts in a couple of days.  Most calling other
people jerks.
