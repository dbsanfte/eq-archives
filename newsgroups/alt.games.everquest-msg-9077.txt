That's why I always keep Symbol of Pinzarn and Valor on the chanter.
It allows for several more seconds where I can cast heal on the
chanter, and atone on the beast the warriors are desperately trying to
taunt off the chanter.

Also, I tend to heal chanters with valor, it heals for 200 hps, and
does not take much mana.
