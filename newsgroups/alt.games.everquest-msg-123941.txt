Hello,

I just got the spell and wanted to know a little about it before I used it.
Here are my questions:

1. Does it automatically work on everyone in the group, or can you target
one person and just cast it on them?

2.  If it does work on everyone in the group, do I target myself when I cast
it?

Just wanted to get all the facts before I actually use it.  Thanks for your
help.
