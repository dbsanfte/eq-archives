I never bothered to reboot. I clicked on the error message and it went away.
I've gotten it several times now though. There aren't any problems that seem
to go along with it that I've noticed, it just bugs me that I even get the
notice. My C drive has about 45g of space left.. that's one of the reasons I
was puzzled by the message, not to mention the fact that I hadn't a clue
what virtual memory actually was. I'll do the empty bin thing... it usually
tends to stay pretty full because I get lots of crap mail. Maybe that alone
will help it. But I -have- decided that memory is much too cheap nowadays to
not have enough, so this week sometime I'm going to get another 256 and
install it. Maybe -that- will fix it.

thanks for the advice, Dan
