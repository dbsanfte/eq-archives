Last night I got on EQ2 after a month and half break. I had a bunch of
udpates to download and when I finally got into the game everything
looked great. Until I went into Qeynos. As I walked around there were
ghost images of things I had already seen duplicated all over my
screen. Has anyone else seen this? Here are my specs.
AMD 64 5500
nVidia 6800 GT
1 gig Ram
