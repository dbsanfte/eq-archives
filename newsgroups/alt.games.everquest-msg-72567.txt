Without Jboots 20-24 is way harder than the levels above, mainly due to the
reason that a wizards level 20 nuke is pretty much useless.  Its a all or
nothing nuke....meaning resists are a big problem. For me 20-24 was a breeze
but then i had Jboots/staff of temp flux and was quad kiting in Lake of Ill
omen for 3 blues of exp per pull. Its a matter of opinion i guess, but most
young wizards i know are pretty pissed that they have to use their level 16
nuke as their main DD through those levels...rightly so too in my opinion.
If a wizard is your first character, i can definately understand why
everyone *at least on the wizard forums on Graffes* say that 20-24 is a
really tough time.  Obviously if you know the game well already then its not
going to be a problem.
