Look up Aliani or Gerrymander tonight, and I'll see if I can walk you
through it (in the daytime...you shaman and your un-reliable "i don't
work against undead anyways" invis...) in Kithicor.

During the day, of course ;-)

I can show you where to stand, where to pull from, where to fight,
and etc...also where and how to single pull the coercer for your
rogue after she ends up popping one day with a Kedge robe on...
;-)
