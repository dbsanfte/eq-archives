I have -no- idea.  We met him in the Sarnak fort and grouped a few times 
with him there, and then he joined us in Dagnor's and has been with us ever 
since.  The guy is -GOOD-.  Even with an Enchanter as my Main, I actually 
prefer having him in the group than having an ecnhanter.  He's great at 
twisting, mezzing, charming, healing, singing mana, etc.

He's a little embarrassed about his armor, and wants to upgrade it, so 
we're all for helping him, as he gets smacked around when we pull 4-5 on 
accident.
