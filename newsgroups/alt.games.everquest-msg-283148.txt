Well that's actually good to hear since we also have a 65 monk at our
disposal.
There would only be me and my brother-in-law on this little PL
escapade so the multi-toon option is out (I friggin hate two-boxing).

So my thinking at this point then is park the chanter, shaman, and
cleric in Gunthak, buff the snot out of him and the pet, log on the
monk and go to town.

Thanks.
