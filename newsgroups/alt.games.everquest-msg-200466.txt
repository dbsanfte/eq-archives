<SNIP: Your new player experiences>

*chuckle*  Thank you for sharing that  :)

: Having skills lag is a result of making the first 10 levels too
: easy.

Or we could turn it around and say having skills lag is a result
of skills increasing too slowly at low levels.

: My bard had 1hs, defense, offense and singing maxed by
: about level 5.  If I'd known back then to get 1hb and piercing
: up, they would have been trivial to max before 10.

I too ignored key skills on my first few characters.  I just didn't
know any better, like most new players.  With luck some of SOE's
recent newbie-friendly changes remind players when important
skills are lagging behind.

Of course having 1-10 go slower wouldn't have helped.  I'd still
have ignored those skills because I didn't realize they were
important.

: I started a
: bard on another server, to see if I could do it better with my
: knowledge - and was able to max piercing, 1hb, 1hs, singing,
: strings, percussion all by level 10.  I also maxed sense heading
: (I started it back then with 20 points - SH increases mainly on
: success, making the first skill gains VERY painful).

I tie Sense Heading to my arrow keys these days.  In the old days
I'd mash it endlessly.  I consider it a foolish design choice on
SOE's part.

: My shaman
: had max Def, Off, 2hb, 1hb by 11 or 12 (started about 6mo after
: release).

<snip>

: Sorry, but I have to agree with Graeme, the only way to make
: 1-10 more trivial than they are now is to make a /newbiebuff
: command that makes them level 10 with all the appropriate skills
: maxed and a set of newbie armor.

I already listed a way to make 1-10 more trivial without resorting
to something as severe as you mention here.

: 1-10 already go by too fast for many new players to learn some
: really basic skills (both player and character).  When combined
: with the zero penalty death brings, I'm suprised players don't
: quit because it's too boring.  We've already seen what happens 
: to the level 10 who suddenly had to find his body on death.  If
: he'd learned that lesson with only his newbie gear on his body
: (which respawned on you until level 4) it would have been far
: less painful.

This is all opinion.  While I respect that opinion I must also
respectfully disagree.  One of my favorite activities is helping
newbies and they don't seem particularly traumatized by 1-10
going too fast.
