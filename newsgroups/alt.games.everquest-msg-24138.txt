Sorry, I'm on Fennin, but I think I'll follow *part* of your advice.
I'll probaby try to start learning Pottery for those idols, or perhaps
drop them on my Enchanter, who is already a master potter. I don't know
how many druids follow Karana, but at least with three backpacks of
pebbles, I have a fair chance of succeeding in making one idol at least
for myself. :)
