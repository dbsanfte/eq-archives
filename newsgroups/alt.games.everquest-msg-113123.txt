When I have a nicely working group of 5, I will be hesitant to add a sixth.
You dont know what you are getting, and one bad member is enough to split up
a group... if the leader is to weak to kick them. I also wont add classes
that we dont need. If we have a cleric, chances are I dont want a second
one. ditto enchanter (me). ditto paladins if we already have a tank (they
are notoriously poor damage dealers). etc etc. Courtesy works 2 ways... you
need to be courteous to your group members as well as those LFG.
