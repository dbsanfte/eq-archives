Critical heals are almost pointless.  I heal a carefully planned amount,
enough and not too much.  Once in a blue moon I'm LOM or damage
is coming in too fast and I need to slam in something smaller than
I'd like... but couple "once in a blue moon" with "this trick hardly ever
works" and its nothing but a pleasant surprise when that critical heal
comes thru.

Faster heals, now, thats another story, and once I hit 56 I may put some
of my precious exp generating time aside to push up to that level
of AA advancement.  Casting time is the biggest cause of healing failure
deaths, and at the same time of inefficient "too soon" heals.  Shave the 10
seconds on a CHeal down to 8?  Yes please may I have another!
