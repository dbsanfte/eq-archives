Normally I would say head to the bazaar, but you indicated elsewhere that 
you have only EQ classic.  Check out http://everquest.allakhazam.com for 
quest information for the various zones you have access to.  Alternatively, 
search through the equipment there for a piercing or bashing weapon that a 
barbarian shaman can equip, it will list the expected level at which you 
can achieve the weapon, and will have links to what mob(s) drop it, and/or 
what quest is used to obtain it.
