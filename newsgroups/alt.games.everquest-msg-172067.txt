Just started playing with a free 30 days CD that came with a magazine.
Originally started out as a human and spent hours wandering around
with a near black screen wondering is this world in perpetual
night-time before someone told me there was some kind of bug with
humans and ATI cards.

So I restarted as a half elf ranger. Having no manual I fumbled my way
along for many hours, picking up hints from google and web sites,
eventually I got going. 

Anyway I found out about the newbie ranger quests of getting a suit of
armour, but now i've come to realize they can't be completed. Most of
the pieces require giant field rat whiskers, i've spent hours roaming
about and only ever come across two (one of which a guard ran up and
killed before I could dispatch it)

From a few threads i've read on google these things are as rare as
hens teeth and actually getting the parts you need from them even
harder.

The game started out badly for me but I persevered and was starting to
think it wasn't too bad after all. I was keen to be working towards
getting some decent armour as i've been playing for three days
straight and still only got a few pieces of cloth and leather armour.

But now i'm feeling disillusioned, I can only earn about 1 pp an hour
and even the crappiest worn out knoll armour is something like 17 pp,
and that's just for one single piece. Seems like i've spent an awful
lot of time playing and gotten extremely little for it.
