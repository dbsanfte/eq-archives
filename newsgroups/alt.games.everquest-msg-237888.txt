Main Entry: non se�qui�tur 
Pronunciation: 'n�n-'se-kw&-t&r also -"tur
Function: noun
Etymology: Latin, it does not follow
1 : an inference that does not follow from the premises; specifically : a 
fallacy resulting from a simple conversion of a universal affirmative 
proposition or from the transposition of a condition and its consequent
2 : a statement (as a response) that does not follow logically from 
anything previously said 

#2 in this case.
