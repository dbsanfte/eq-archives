Friends,

I am planning a group event for my guild and want to go to Runneyeye.
My experience here includes passing through a few times while
traveling between Qeynos and Freeport as well as getting my butt
kicked on a few occasions trying to solo from levels 25 to 30 (I am
currently a 31st Warrior).

The group I'm getting together will most likely consist of a 27th
Ranger, 29th Druid, 31st Warrior, 31st Rogue and 33rd Paladin. I
realize that experience for this group will be slim to none, but exp
is not our primary motivator. We are going mainly to collect a lot of
blackened alloy stuff and as a bonding event for our guild.

My question is where in Runneyeye to camp and how to get to those
camps. I have the EQ Atlas maps of the dungeon, but I don't know the
camp spots.

We want a camp site to collect blackened alloy stuff � both armor and
weapons (I personally could use a pair of bals � pun intended). I also
would like instructions on how to get there - not to Runneyeye, I know
how to get there � but a plan of attack for getting to and securing
the camp spot.

Thanks,

B.
