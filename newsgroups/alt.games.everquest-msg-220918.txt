Funny thing is, not all that long ago the  situation was the
other way around; nobody wanted knights for MA since they had
less HP and less AC.  Was the change due to melee rebalancing, or
to changed perception among players, or was it because with the
advent of POP mob aggro control became much more important than
it was before?

More to the point, aggro control costs DPS.  Since the game is
almost entirely about DPS these days, why hold back in order to
let the warrior keep aggro, when you can go flat out and
slaughter the mob quicker with a knight?  This means the DPS
classes benefit (they get to use everything they have) and the
healers benefit (mob dies faster, thus doing less damage to the
MA) and the slowers benefit (because they get to slow sooner,
making their slow more effective) and even the mezzers benefit
(because they don't get beaten to a bloody pulp as frequently on
mez break, since the high aggro knight is better at getting the
mob's attention.... and because they are also often responsible
for other debuffing jobs which they can do flat out since the
knights have aggro in hand)
