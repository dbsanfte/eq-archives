I am not one to normally get in on the action here, I like to read a
lot of your comments, and I find the flames and things quite ammusing,
but the information here really helps out a lot of people...


However that is not the intention of this post. I noticed there is a
patch scheduled for Thursday and a 10 hour one at that. So to all
those that are gonna be here claiming EQ sucks, Verant Sucks, Sony
Sucks, the I'm quitting EQers, the you EQers sux and such... I wanna
be the first to ask.




CIHYS?
