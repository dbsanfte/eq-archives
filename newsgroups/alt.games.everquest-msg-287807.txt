The Internet has been forging ahead with breakneck speed. Together
with this phenomenal growth, many online games have also risen very
quickly. Massive multi player role playing games (MMORPG) like
Everquest have been immensely successful. Other popular games include
World of Warcraft, Runescape, and many others.

One of the most interesting feature of such games is the currency
used. A currency in an online game is actually just like scores in any
ordinary game. However, these points can be used to acquire special
items. In many games, special items are very important. They help the
players gain new levels more quickly, and the success or failure of an
adventure often depends on these special items. As a result, many
players, especially those with new characters, choose to buy game
currencies with real cash. But the problem is, where can they find
reliable sellers? After all, the Internet is a huge place.

Fortunately, there are websites that serve this specific requirement.
These websites are also known as marketplaces. Similar to any
marketplace you find online, you will be able to carry out online
transactions with other members of the website. The most famous
website of this kind is Account Market (www.accountmarket.com)

For instance, you will be able to buy or sell World of Warcraft gold.
Sometimes, you may also be able to buy or sell full accounts. That
means your account comes with everything you need in the game and you
won't need to start off as a beginner.

Of course, you will have to careful when dealing with anyone online.
Usually, such marketplaces have some kind of feedback system, where
members can leave either positive or negative feedback based on their
trades. The more positive feedback a member has, the easier it is to
get other members to trust him and trade with him. If you are going to
trade with someone with no feedback (e.g. trading with a new member),
then make sure that the transaction is a small one. Just in case the
person on the other end fail to deliver, you don't stand to lose much.
Trade wisely and minimize your risk.

Once a transaction has been confirmed, further instructions on how to
complete the transfer will be sent to you either via email or instant
messenger. If it's a currency transfer, you may need to fix a time to
meet in the game so that the right amount of currency can be
transferred to you. If it's an account you are buying, the full
account details can be sent to you directly via email.

In addition, online games marketplaces have evolved to serve the
different needs of their members. You may even be able to buy or sell
websites, domain names, scripts, ebooks, images, software and other
digital files.

By visiting similar marketplaces regularly, you may be able to pick up
some great deals. That is because most deals are conducted in auction
style. Auction means a deal may start off with a really low bid, and
the seller hopes that more people can bid on whatever he is selling.
If there are few bidders to compete, you may find yourself buying
something that you want at a really low price.

Most importantly, the bidding process is often fun, and may even be
addictive. Get hooked if you will and enjoy yourself on these great
game marketplaces.
