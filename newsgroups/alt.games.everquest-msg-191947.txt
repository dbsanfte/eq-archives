}Yes, please don't mind me.  

Heh, I never do, since you've usually shown yourself to be a 
right-thinking type poster.  Ie, the kind that agrees with me two falls 
out of three. :)

I think it's more a connection issue than a graphics card issue, strangely 
enough.  And for me it's usually a 'having 2-3 EQW's open and one of them 
is in the bazaar' issue.

Yea, played with it a bit more last night, and now I'm -really- not sure 
if it stacks as advertised or not.  Gonna have to get really bored and run 
back and forth across WK a few times. :)

}From the sound of

Heh, naw, Sony's finger was already there, is all. :) I just wish they'd 
-fix- horses. :)

}Now if I could only figure out what my vested interest is...

Kinda wondering that myself.  You got hired by Sony?  *envy* :)
