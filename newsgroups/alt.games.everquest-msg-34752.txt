Ah.  What spells was it dropping?  The Ancient Wyvern isn't all that tough
to kill, was it?  I mean, my 51 enchanter, along with a 51 druid, a 47 bard
that was just there for mana song (2nd computer) and 43 cleric brought its
hitpoints down to 3/4 (read: hurt, but not that badly) before we realized we
were outclassed (early on in the fight, we're not totally dense...no tanks +
summoning critter means lots o' death) and ran screaming to the zoneline
like girls, while the bard kept getting summoned back and eventually killed.
I think if we had a couple of tanks it'd've been dead.

I'd hate to think something that easy would be dropping rare spells, and I
wouldn't consider that a nerf, if that's what it was doing.
