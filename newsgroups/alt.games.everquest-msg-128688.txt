Clerics get CH.  That one spell COMPLETELY UNBALANCES EVERY FUCKING
ENCOUNTER IN THE GAME.  Guild_03 is thinking about doing Vindi, it's not
"How many *priests* do we have on?", it's "How many clerics that know how to
do a CH rotation do we have on?"

Besides, clerics can buy SoW potions, I don't see anyone making me a
clickable CH stick.

This really isn't about spells being balanced, it's more about the cleric
+5% druid/shaman -10% healing spell modifiers being somewhere between
"Blatantly Homosexual" and "Flaming Queer" on the gaydar. (no offense
intended to any real gays out there btw)
