Have you ever actually used Battle.Net? I find it hard to believe that
someone could have done so and still made this statement.

As to your other points, EverQuest's distribution model is a lot
different from, say, StarCraft's. Once StarCraft is out, it's out. You
don't get any changes to the game until you buy an expansion.
EverQuest is constantly being updated. Nearly every week, changes are
slip-streamed into the content. Right there is a *huge* difference.
