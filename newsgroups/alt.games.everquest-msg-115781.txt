I am an almost 30th Enchanter. I have/had numerous characters of
various levels. Form one reason or another I got bored. I know my role
as an enchanter, and know how others are supposed to work, by playing
that class.

I was guilded, and left because the guild merged and merged and
finally I was in a guild with a lot of crude, rude, people. I am
referring to dood speak (sux, KK), homosexual references (sodomizing a
mob, ubahness), stuff I outgrew a long time ago.

There were a few, but they went to DAOC, or are in the guild and
quiet. Every guild I joined I found by accident. Now I want to to it
deliberatly. Please tell me where and how did you select your guild
affiliation.
