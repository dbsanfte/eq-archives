I seem to remember seeing someone with a pair of them one time, but may be
wrong.  The things are too slow to suit me and if I am going for slow and
high damage will use 2hs.  A while back I had a mid 20s troll warrior with a
yak and a wurm try to ks from my mid 30s ranger who at the time was using a
Morin and Thurian claws.  It frustrated him no end that I could out damage
him with those low damage but fairly fast blades.  That incident pretty much
convinced me that at least for a ranger with dual wield speed is of the
essence.  The blades you mention are by the way very good, but personally, I
prefer one in my primary hand that has a speed of 22 or less and am not sure
of the speed of those you mention.
