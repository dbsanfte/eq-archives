I'd steer clear of the bandit camp until in the mid teen as they are a bit
hard for 8 or 10.

Not too long ago my friend and I started a new toon (ranger and pally), got
into PC at lvl 5 with a 57 shammy for support, grinded up to 15 in 2 hours
with the Phlarg Fiends.  By the time we were done, the island were covered
with 30 or 40 corpses.  I'll probably head to the bandit camp soon.
