I don't know offhand about the AC. But there *are* several mobs that 
must be spawned... Crusaders in the Feerott for the SK darkforge (epic 
related) as just one of thousands of examples. If a 30th level SK group 
is killing lizard men, and a 65th SK stands there invised and waiting 
and then ninja-kills the Crusader the moment it pops while the 30th 
group is still recovering from the last round of justicars, judicators 
and zealots then the 65th SK deserves to be dealt with harshly...
