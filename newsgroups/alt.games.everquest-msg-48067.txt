A quick question about macros.   can you set it up so the macro stops
executing if a previous command works.

For example, my cleric wants to use stun, so I have something like this:

/gs Let me see if I can stun that %T
/cast # (stun)

If the stun fails it can confuse the rest of the group (if they are really
dumb!), and I'd prefer not to waste screen space with the /gs unless it
works.  What I want is something like this:

/cast # (stun)
/if_it_failed_stop_right_here
/gs The %T is stunned - see if you big tough warriors can kill it now.

probably need a pause in there as well I suppose.

Is this possible?

Thanks
