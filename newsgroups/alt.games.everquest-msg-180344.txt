Ditto that.. when I used GMU/Primal combo I had primal in offhand, and once
the first proc came, subsequent procs were fast and furious..

I dunno if weapons can have a proc-rate, frequency or something set to them?
Or its just fluke... but my primals always proced 10 billion times more than
any other weapon I had just about
