OR you can pick a single target, start mez, switch to a second target 
and melee... as long as you don't twist, the song will stay on your 
first target.  Of course thats not terribly interesting in most cases, 
since if you NEED CC its usually because you have three or four mobs in 
camp.  And its crippling, because you aren't singing mana or regen or 
slow/snare or haste... you are wasting all your singing on mezzing just 
one mob.

But it does work.
