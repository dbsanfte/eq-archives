I understand that, which is why I said Quote
PvP is the sole means of accumulating PK points, and the PK points are 
the sole purpose behind the server, as a wipe is coming in a month 
anyway, with the player with the highest PK value getting the only 
permanent reward.

Second person in two days to think I wasn't reading a notice.

I'm interested in some discussion about the server/contest though.

What class would you pick?

What race?

Can we get some AGE grouping together?  I'd think groups would really 
have a strong advantage over most of the population, which seems to be 
intent on soloing; 6 people should be able to wipe one person pretty 
easy, and 5 people should be able to PL a dead person back up fairly 
quickly.

Hmm, unanswered question; if 6 people in a group kill one person, do 
they each get one PK point, or 1/6th a PK point?

For that matter, do you get 1 point for one kill, regardless of whether 
you are level 50 killing a level 6, a level 6 killing a level 50, or 
anything in between?  Or do you get, say, 6 points for killing a level 6 
and 50 for killing a level 50?  Or do you get PK points in a 
proportional way, just as you get ordinary exp proportionally based on 
the level of the mob and your level relative to the mob?

1 point per kill seems to me to be what they are describing, if so, that 
sort of sucks, creating a "fish in the barrel" server environment, with 
no reason for people to travel to other zones and rain destruction on 
people in other cities, or indeed to do anything but pick on the freshly 
level 6.

On the other hand, if its the reverse, a group could collude to build up 
massive points on one person by all leveling up high, then letting him 
kill them all while he's level one, for maximum gain.  Since he's under 
level 6, he's immune to death causing total point loss, too!

In fact, either way thats probably the ultimate game winning plan; if 
its one point one kill, then level up to 6 and let your buddy kill you, 
repeat.  Level that buddy up to 5 and give him all the best gear you can 
gather, while you are at it, making sure he stays somewhere risk free.

Splendid
