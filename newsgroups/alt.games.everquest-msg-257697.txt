Here's an example (numbers are made up)

Say you have 2k hp and your pet has 2k hp, and each of you does 50 DPS

If you send in your pet, then you have a 2khp tank doing 50DPS. 
Likewise, if you could manage to keep your pet out of the fight, you 
have a 2khp tank doing 50DPS.

BUT if you and your pet fight at the same time, you have a 2khp tank 
doing 100DPS (more like 107 DPS if you get your pet behind the mob).

Then when you get down low, but not so low that you will get low HP 
aggro, you back off and let pet tank; he does his 50 DPS now; this means 
that this strategy, even without you casting any spells at all, gives 
you nearly 4khp and an average of 75 DPS.

Even if you let pet tank till dead and then stepped in on your own, 
you'd have the 4khp but a DPS of only 50; so the "both at once" plan 
works better.

And of course you -aren't- unable to do anything useful while your pet 
is fighting; you can heal him, heal yourself, slow the mob, aggro the 
mob and let it chase you, all sorts of options.
