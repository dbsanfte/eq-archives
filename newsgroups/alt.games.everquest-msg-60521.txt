I am considering leaving my server and am looking for a place to call home.
I would like to move where there is a friendly guild that is able to do
effective raiding (such as would be required to perform epics).  I love to
help people and will contribute as best I can.  If you have such a guild in
need of a cleric, please send me an email.
