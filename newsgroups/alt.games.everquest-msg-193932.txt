It's a reasonably new spell. About a month ago, they got rid of a
couple of the 'useless' lvl 63-64 shaman spells that nobody ever
wanted. Single target and group Dex, Str. Since they didn't stack with
Focus the only people that ever wanted them were whiny clerics <g>
that wanted stat buffs w/o focus. I think it was replaced by a
combination Str/Dex buff (single and group version), group shrink, and
the group haste. 

The haste isn't quite as good as the single target version, shaman get
SLTW at 63 and I think the group version has the same haste as
Celerity. I'm still looking forward to getting it though, having to
single buff 3 or 4 people every 15 minutes is a serious pain. I'm
willing to take a bit less haste for the convenience of having it as a
group buff.
