Many quest mobs are 'marked'. For example, there's a quest called
'bandit bait' where you need to kill...uh..bandits. They pop up for
you on the road, and no one else can kill them. (At one point, they
were bugged so that they'd aggro on ANYONE, not just the quest guy,
but the victims couldn't fight back...Ouch.)

Then the Bandit Chief pops up and tries to kill you. You kill him and
get an item which triggers another quest. (Due to...yes, more
bugs...he actually popped for me about three times. STAY DEAD,
DAMMIT!)
