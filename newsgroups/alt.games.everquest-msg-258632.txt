ok, so i was looking at instruments for my bard and i noticed that some
weapons and armor have instrument effects.  for example, a sword that had 19
percussion instruments, or a mask that had 16 wind instruments.  if i wore
the mask and got out my flute that has 22 wind instruments, would the two
stack?  or would i only get the effect of the higher one?
