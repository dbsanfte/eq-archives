Remind me to clear out my old ignore list, many of them were for
bazaar casino scams and they are probably not around anymore.  I just
wish I knew what server is going to merge with Vazaelle so I could
check it out and see if I end up setting a one day record for most
ignores added or not.  I do hope there is at least one uber guild on
the other server to give Triality a hard time on Vazaelle.  I won't
state reason for my beef against Triality guild on Vazaelle but I can
say I have NEVER heard anyone say a nice thing about that guild.
