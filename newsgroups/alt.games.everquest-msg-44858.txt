Travel to Highpass. Exit the zone heading into E. Karanas. Shortly after
you come out of the tunnel, at the beginning of the ramp, you'll see a
huge chasm off to the side. Get a running start towards the edge and do
a jump just as you reach the edge. You'll land in the plane of hate.
  Just watch that first step. It's a doozy.
