Um, well - you can get into quite a semantics battle over this kind of
stuff.  EQ definately works behind NAT, wether it's from a 'frirewall' or a
'broadband router' or whatever.

I have one of the Linksys broadband routers and it works fine.  I did have
some problems with the configuration that I originally had not working right
and ended up having to go back to a default configuration to get it to work
(even tho the DMZ was open some ports weren't making it though, for those of
you that have never dealt with routers and firewalls they all have problems
that they shouldn't, it's just the way the world works).

So, it'll work with NAT, and you obviously have to have the ports it needs
able to be opened, and sometimes a certain configuration will just freak it
out.  That's my summary.
