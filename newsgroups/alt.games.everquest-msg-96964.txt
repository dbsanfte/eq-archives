Not for most of the zones, no, but you do need a big guild or a few close
personal friends who play the same time you do.  Not everyone has that.  In
fact, I'm willing to bet that the average is 1 RL friend per player.  Kinda
tough to do most of these zones when you have strikes like that against you.

It's not powergamer vs role-player.  I'm neither.  I don't come anywhere
NEAR either.  Sometimes I do the xp grind (you pretty much have to post 51
if you ever want to see the next level) and USUALLY my gnome is gnomish
(grumpy, racist) but besides making an occasional comment about stupid
barbarians, snooty high elves, etc., I don't RP at all.
