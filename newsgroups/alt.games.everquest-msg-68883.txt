All I can say on the subject is that the HE ranger I normally group with
never complains about any problems after I stamina buff her.  No slow down
of attacks, no effect on AC, no effect that she has noticed at all.  Her
stamina bar goes down to zero regularly during fights.  Without my STA buff,
her stamina is below 100, with it, it is now 130.
