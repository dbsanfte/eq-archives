I've done royals with a single (60+) group but all I could tell you is
that it involved a SK snare pulling and a cleric lulling from a bit
further back. I didn't see the actual pulls but the fights themselves
where trivial, pulling (only) the right mobs at the right time seemed
to be the diffiicult part. 

Given the level of your guildies, I don't think I'd worry about it too
much. Either they'll get high enough at some point to help you with it
or you'll find some other friends that will. Wish you were on
Bristlebane, I'm pretty sure that I could get up a group to help you
out there. :(

Rgds, Frank
