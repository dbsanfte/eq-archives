Heh. The thing is, I don't relate adventure to XP'ing. For me, adventure 
was pulling a lvl 60's corpse out of the Scorpiki Gorge in OT when I was 
lvl 30, or helping a rogue do the Staff of the Wheel quest (why he wanted 
it, I have no idea :), or travelling alone to the Temple of Veeshan for 
the hell of it. But as far as actually getting the ol' yellow bar to 
move, the easier and quicker, the better.
