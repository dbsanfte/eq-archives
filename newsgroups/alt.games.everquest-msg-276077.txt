Only way I'm aware of is if somebody petitions you for having a bad
name.  In my experience (with friends, don't bother with last names
myself), they will not change it when you request it, but they hop
pretty quickly if somebody finds it offensive.  Just have one of your
friends /petition and say it is an extremely offensive slang term in
Lithuanian or something ;)
