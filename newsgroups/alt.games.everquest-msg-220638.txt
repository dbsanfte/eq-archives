In a case wherein domesticated cats and dogs became rare (and that isn't 
going to happen anytime soon), there would be homes for the offspring, and 
thus no reason to neuter the cat or dog.

*sighs*  In general, though, I foresee that this discussion is going to 
continue to go nowhere, because you're just as adamant in your position as 
everyone else is on theirs.  Congrats, though, on the _fastest_ thread 
derailing that I've seen in ages.  :>
