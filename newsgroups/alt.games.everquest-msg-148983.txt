/sigh

They only fixed because I had to practically beat them over the
head with it. 15+ emails, 3 phone calls, 3 petitions.

Over and over I got the same canned email response form telling
me to send the same information I had sent in my first email.
Over and over I kept getting the same canned response from
the guides: "I'm sorry there is nothing we can do, factions can
not be restored for any reason."

Which was total bullshit. The bug caused my factions to be reset.
All they had to do was look at a recent back up of my character and
compare it to my current one and it would be plainly obvious. OBVIOUS.

The lead GM finally reset my character from the back up.
