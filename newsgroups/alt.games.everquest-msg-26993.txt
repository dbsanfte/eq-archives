You're crazy for even thinking that you did anyone wrong.  When trading with
someone they can look at the stat's in the window BEFORE hitting the trade
button.  He offered the money in the first place.  If he doesn't like it
tell him to do a price check before buying something.  I've gotten burned a
number of times for items I couldn't wear or over paid on.  Did I shout
nonsense about how Soandso cheated me, no.  I just gave it to another char
of mine or bit the bullet and lived with the loss.  Last night I bought a
Blackened Iron Medallion for 100pp,  just found out it's only worth 50pp but
hey I got 3 WIS off it so I'm happy with it.
