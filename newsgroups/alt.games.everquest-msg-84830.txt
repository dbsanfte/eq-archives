I'm thinking from those pictures though that those "interface
enhancements" like the map are web only. So you can use them OUT of
the game but would need a second computer to use them IN game. I get
that impression from the 'Updated at X time and date" thing at the
bottom of the map.. makes it sound like its updating it sometimes from
the server.

Guess we'll know when it goes up. Hmm in fact I'm going to go ask this
on the dev board right now.
