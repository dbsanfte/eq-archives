process is getting more and more demanding. Furthermore it could be your
latest drivers or dx9 causing problems. dx8.1 is still advised.

It would be cool indeed if such was possible but sadly it's not. And bazaar
is one of the most instable zones. High latency much lag but well what can
you do. I think they've chosen itfor some practical reasons.

systeminstability can be caused by so many factors it's impossible to see
what's going on anyway. Best suggestion is to relax the heating limit a bit
and see if it improves. If so you might need to clean out your system a bit
cause cloolers suck up dust etc. etc. that might be the cause of heatbased
crashes/shutdowns.
