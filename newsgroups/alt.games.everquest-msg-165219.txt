I have killed the ac 3 times in sro with my druid. Each time i was
just porting in and going to oasis. First time i was kiting a SG and
got jumped by the AC too. I was about 40m and blew the rest of my mana
on resisted nukes on the AC. I had to kill both with the dot from my
es vambraces but not beofre they almost killed me. Second time I was
pling a guildie and got jumped by the AC. And the third time i was
running thruthe zone to oasis and saw it on track. First time i was
about lvl 40 and last time about lvl 49. And each time it seemed very
highly MR and a hard kill for a green mob. Thank goodness for MQing.
