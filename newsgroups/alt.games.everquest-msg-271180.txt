Hmm, that's an interesting conjecture.  :-)

Let's see . . . I can't imagine any druid, bard or hunter being in that 
category.

Roaming do-gooder paladins probably wouldn't be, either.

Stay-at-home mage types might be, but they should be able to conjure or 
spell something up to handle their disorientation, and maybe with your 
conjecture they should have to.

Soooo . . . that leaves warrior-types and rogues with limited mapping 
skills, maybe?
