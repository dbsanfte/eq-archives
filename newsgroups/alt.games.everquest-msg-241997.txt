But of the wayfarer camps, only BB has the skellies in camp.  The
EC skellies stay out in the plains.

Of course, the Everfrost camp already had hordes of mobs passing
through all the time.  If I'm in Everfrost and need to med, I port
to EC and med there instead. :)

As for the skellies, I can't imagine what they're like for newbies,
but at least newbies have a chance to get some xp from them.  My
main (monk 27) and alt (druid 16) ar both at the stage where the
conscripts are green, but the next ones up are deadly.  It's
particularly frustrating for the monk, seeing a trooper or
footsoldier or whatever that cons blue, so I tag it and get hit
by a Lifetap for 241, or "You lose control of yourself" (whatever
spell that is; can't find one with that text on Allakhazam) that
leaves me running across the zone unable to feign death or even
to /yell for help while the skellies beat me to death.

My only hope is that this is only temporary, and the armies will go
away after the anniversary month is over.  In the meantime, I'm
getting in a lot of tradeskill practice.
