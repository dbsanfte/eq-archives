 Just a technical nit: The haste isn't spell haste it's bard song haste.

 Personally I prefer it that way. If it were item haste I wouldn't be
able to hit 80% haste solo. Plus, if there is an Enchanter nearby my
epic stacks with shisshar so I still get the added ac/atk of my epic in
addition to the enchanter haste.
