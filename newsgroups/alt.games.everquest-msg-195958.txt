Yep, and the other part of it is the secondary melees don't pay enough
attention to aggro management since they figure the cleric has kei so why
not make the most of it?  They forget that once I start a ch, if the mob
switches targets then I have to make a decision as to whether to break off
in mid cast or not.  Once 2 'tanks' get to mid hp level then it becomes a
guessing game as to which should be healed.  I don't remember that anyone
has actually died yet from this, but my bias is always going to be towards
saving the actual mt and letting paladinwannabetank bite it.
