Note that if you use the automated windows updater, you've already got 
this... but apparantly EQ won't accept it, instead you have to go thru 
this manual process.

Handy, for those of us who haven't bothered to get whatever expansion 
that was, or for those "bot" accounts with only the critical expansions.

That would have been funny without the guild lobby being available to 
all.  I only have 4 veteran points though, since I dropped out of EQ and 
sold my account, the first time I left.  Since then I learned, just stop 
paying and I can join up again later without having to start completely 
from scratch.

Nice.  Kind of a slap in the face to the track classes isn't it?  One of 
the biggest advantages to bard track was being able to find people who 
were misplaced as I recall... particularly once they made it possible to 
invite people you couldn't see.

That seems kind of silly.  Wasn't it originally 6?  Then 10 and now back 
to 6?  Make up your minds!  Still, if you consider those to be "learning 
  levels" its nice to actually see consequences to death during them, no 
matter how small.

Nice to know, printed that out.  So... are any of those actually 
"indoors"?  An outdoor zone thats a hot zone is pretty much the same as 
a usual indoor zone, exp wise, isn't it?  Several of the zones on that 
list have decent exp camps well outside their posted level range.

Am I overlooking something, or are all of those RoK zones?  Whats up 
with that... if they were all "classic" zones I'd say it was so nobody 
felt ripped off for not having bought any expansions.

But since the only fire pets which use mana suck horribly unless you 
manage to run them out of mana so they stop the abyssimally stupid spell 
casting choices, this only makes them even more crippled...

Good, I'd really like to know whats going on there, I've often suspected 
the procs aren't helping much at all, or wondered if the spells were 
going off much or whatever.

Hmm, don't remember this seeming "broken"

Handy... I didn't even know you could block spells in the first place. 
My cleric used to run in fear from Focus...

How about other party members?  Or perfect strangers?

Did they still neglect the issue where you can't cast eye of zomm or 
tallon while on drogback?

They already mentioned that...

Er, they were broken before?  I never noticed.

Interesting, although I'll have to see it all at work to figure out what 
this really ends up meaning

Thats really vague.  But from looking around, it seems what they mean is 
  that they will check LOS only when firing the ranged item/spell, not 
during the whole trip.

Range?  As in distance, or as in skill required, or what?

Great!  That really pissed me off!  But then again, I made that pot 
myself, with a skill much much lower than that required to do so.  I 
doubt many people care about this one.

Although those armors still aren't very good at all, at least this 
should make them a little better in terms of risk vs reward (or tedium 
vs reward, if you look at it that way)

Hmm, big change?  Never did an LDoN raid actually, so I just have to 
imagine.

Well, my bard would have been very pissed about that, and now 
delighted... if it wasn't for the fact that I was gone the whole time it

No?  Pity, that would have made getting keys a little faster.  Still, no 
biggie.

What?  No more kicking snakes?  What on earth is EQ coming to?!!!

We'll believe that when we see it

Again, we'll see.

Great news... or it would be if most of those models didn't suck, and 
all of them didn't suck down CPU cycles or whatever it is when they make 
your system lag down to a near halt.
