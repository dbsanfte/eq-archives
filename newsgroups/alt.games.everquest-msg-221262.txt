Kunark - ability to level past 50
Velious - new interface
Luclin - new graphics engine and interface
POP - ability to level past 60, nodrop spells with high functionality
LOY - charms, interface upgrades
LDON - Augmentations

Sony has a history of making it unpleasant to *not* buy an expansion- other 
people get an advantage that you cannot get.

Hell, I bought Velious at level 20 *just* for the interface.
