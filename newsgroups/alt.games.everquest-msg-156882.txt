So, let me guess:  you did get XP on raids before, right?
At 55ish, on one *short* raid of about three hours, I got almost
two yellow "real" XP.  It's nice to have 35 other people power
level you...

In my experience, people who say "it's not about XP" are either
in the KS group or high on the possible loot order.
