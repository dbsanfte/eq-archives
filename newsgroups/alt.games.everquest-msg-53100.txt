There was a Hate raid on my server (The Nameless) that had a wipeout,
and a few accidents during corpse recovery.  That left so many corpses
near the zone in that people's frame rate dropped to about 2 frames a
second when they zoned in, making it impossible to fight.  At that
point, not even the server's uber guilds would have been able to help.
The GM had to depop the zone to allow corpse recovery.  Note that
Verant's policy is that the Planes are at-your-risk, and there will be
no GM assistence there at all.  If Verant had not ignored their own
rules, several dozen people would have lost all their equipment.  (I
believe this incident was one of the main reasons Verant added the
command to hide corpses, BTW).
