I think you fail to account for the fact that the ability to solo
depends a great deal on the level at which you are. It's probably
practical for a knowledgeable player to go from 1 to 40 in EQ. But
I doubt that it's practical after that. Also, the developer went
out of their way to discourage solo in later patch. So, if you
played EQ shortly after its release, you would have seen a lot more
people soloing back then. I did solo all the way through level 20.
After that it's small group of 2 or 3. After 30, insisting on soloing
really makes it hard on yourself.

As for the earliest people who hit 50. Well, it does tell you
that solo all the way to 50 is possible. But it doesn't tell you if
doing so is normally practical.

Later...
