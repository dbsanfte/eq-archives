Hi All,

While waiting for the servers to come up (again) I would like to mention
something that has gotten on my nerves lately.

Druids kiting in crowded areas.

I'm a Druid, and it would never occur to me to quad-kite wyverns in CS near
the tower if other players are there. There are enough spawns for everyone
and it's downright rude! If you're all by your lonesome - go for it! But
show some consideration! It's NOT a camp!

Those Cobalt Drakes are dangerous and everyone wants to be close to the
zone! Just take one at a time and relax : )
