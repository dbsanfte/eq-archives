A cheap no weight reduction giant item bag is the large tool kit on sale
from the iceclad pirate gnomes.

The cheapest weight reduction bags should be the shralok bag (highpass
hold ), evil eye bag (lower guk ), the bag you get while camping the charsis
key piece in kaesora , the bag rathyl in najena drops and the bag you get
from doing the jujum quest in rivervale .

The three best bags are the treasure hunters satchel(dragons), kavruuls
mystical pouch (dragons) ,large coin purse (dragon).

The bags most people are using are tinkerer sacks bought from the sol a
gnome merchant (10 space 100% reduction for 5250 at best deal)

Note that one really good bag is better than 3 so so bags so make your
acquisitions accordingly.
