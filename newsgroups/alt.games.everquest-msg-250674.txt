Valor isn't swarm kitable[1] (mobs are too high level).  It is,
however, AE kitable[2], which is even better for experience.  The
difference is difficulty, though, is quite large, at least to me.
Not that I've ever worked hard at acquiring the skill.

In any case, bards are a) the number 1 solo-for-exp class, b) a very
interesting class to play, c) desired for groups.  Simply put, the
best class in Everquest. ;-)

[1] Find lots of social mobs, bunch them up, charm one and have the
rest beat it to an inch of its life, then break charm, finish it off
and repeat until all are dead.

[2] Find lots of mobs, bunch them up really close, run in tight
circles around them while playing point blank AE damage songs, repeat
until all dead. The best experience in the game if you can avoid dying
too often.
