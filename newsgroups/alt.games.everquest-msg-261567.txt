As long as you're taking care of business (slowing, hasting, healing, 
buffing all as necesary) and can do so without constantly running low on 
mana and thereby slowing the group down, feel free to jump in and mix it 
up. Just watch aggro. The trouble is, it's hard for a shaman to do all he 
can for a group *without* having mana issues. There is rarely much time 
left for more than the necessary canni'ing.
