Yeah, the media should stick to the facts about Bush Jr.  Like the
fact that he was a lousy businessman and succeeded only due to
family money.  And that under his leadership in Texas, education
went downhill and the state achieved the dubious honor of "most
polluted state in the United States".  Or we could talk about the
$250 billion deficit he's managed to create in less than two years
in office (but I'm sure he'll keep pushing for tax cuts).

George W. "Forrest Gump" Bush.
