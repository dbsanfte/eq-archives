I just bought the same DSL/Router and have experienced the same problem.

Check the router configuration settings (http://192.168.1.1) on the bottom
there are two options with radio-buttons but the exact names escape me ATM.

If you change the number of the first one (5 is the default parameter) to 0,
your router will always stay connected. I just made the change last night,
so will not know if this will solve it until i get back to EQ later tonight.

Also, I too and on SBC-Global.net for my DSL provider....you in CA too?
