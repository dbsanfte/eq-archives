Reading around about weaponry in various forums, I often encounter the 
phrase "but with a haste its a " and some god awful damage to delay ratio.

To me, this is nonsense in almost all cases, the sole exceptions being 
weapons with built in haste or perhaps something like An Executioner Axe 
which procs a haste buff.

I'm using a 40/40 weapon (Reaver).  With 100% haste between buff and 
item and maybe a bard song, that would be a 40/20 weapon, right?

NO, says I, thats wrong.  With the same 100% haste, a real 40/20 weapon 
would be a 40/10 weapon!  The 40/20 weapon is twice as good as the 40/40 
weapon, and stays that way with the same haste advantages.

Comparing a weapon with haste on to someone else's weapon with them 
unhasted is just fooling yourself.

The reason I make the exceptions above are that the weapons with built 
in haste can make the assumption that that degree of haste is always 
there... at the lower end may be competing with no item haste or a low 
one.

And the items with a haste buff may again be competing against no haste 
buff... although since in the case of the Exe Axe the proc only lasts 3 
tics and doesn't go off constantly it can't really add up to a very big 
boost to the DPS.  And any haste proc or clicky is almost certainly 
going to be lower than whats available if you group with a chanter, 
shaman, or even bard or beastlord, too, so you should only consider that 
for cases when you're alone... worse, the Exe Axe ended up overwriting 
my chanter friend's haste buff on me, then fading in 18 seconds, so I 
ended up with a net negative haste effect using it, had to switch back 
to my backup weapon!
