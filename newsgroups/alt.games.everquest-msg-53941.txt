Although I don't doubt that you can point out the logical error in my thinking,

I'm wondering what possible difference lack of an AOE would make when
soloing something.

When I'm taking on a cobalt drake, the only difference to me in him
having an AOE versus an effect directed at me personally is that I need
to be more careful where I kite to avoid hitting "innocent bystanders."

A group is six times as vulnerable to an AOE; a raid dozens of times
more vulnerable to an AOE; one guy, alone, with no targets nearby
he needs to avoid?  AOE = DD

If I were soloing something (hmm, I do way too much of that already
as a cleric) I'd be on the lookout not for AOE, but for harmtouch or
worse, deathtouch.  "Dragon says SHAMAN" and its all over.
