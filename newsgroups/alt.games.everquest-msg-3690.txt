The effects of that will be easier to understand if you take it 
to extreme values like a random 0 10.  How, now, do you say what 
value the 9 in a 0 10 roll is equivalent to in a 0 100 roll?  
Higher than 90?  Equal to 90?  Equal to 95?

Now imagine someone rolling /random 0 10 when everyone else rolls 
a /random 0 100.  I do not think any party would consider this to 
be a legitimate roll.  "But my 9 equals your 90, and you only 
rolled an 82, so I win!"  All those who would accept that, raise 
their hands now.  By the time you get to /random 0 99, the effect 
is quite tiny, but the principle of the thing gets to be pretty 
damned important when you're rolling on, say, Cobalt Guantlets or 
a SMR.  Especially when you roll a tie (see below).

Absolutely.  He rolled on a table with different values than 
everybody else did.  His 99 would be equal to slightly more than 
your 99.  The scenario you MUST consider is if he ties with the 
highest legit roller - he could theoretically argue that his 
result was higher than the other's (I say theoretically because 
in practice, all hell would break loose).  Do you see the problem 
now?

> Can you make him like it?

You can disband him.  Foolishness like this would get an 
immediate disband from me.
