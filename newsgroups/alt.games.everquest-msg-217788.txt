    At this point, that's not what it does. Look at the details on
Modulation (the mod rod effect) on Lucy for details. Modulation says
"Increase Mana by 150", where this says "Increase Mana Pool by 20". This
effect also has a duration (currently flagged unlimited), whereas any
one-shot effect is flagged "Instant". This does what it says it does -
increases the capacity of your mana pool by 20 points.
