Now that is something I have never seen.  But, it would appear to mean that
something else is still running.  I shut down everything that is not needed
for EQ.  You probably have a bunch of icons down in you task bar that
represent applications that are still running, like antivirus software,
firewall software, volume control (OK, I leave that one), Kazoa, AOL
launcher(not on my system), and various others.  I shut them all down.  If
that doesn't do it, Ctrl-Alt-Del, look at what is running using the task
manager.  I paid for Allakhazam a while back, so I don't get any of those
pop ups from them anymore, I use the site all the time, and felt it was well
worth the minimal amount they were asking for to get the added features, and
no popups.
