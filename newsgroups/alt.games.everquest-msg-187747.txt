No, the job of the cleric is to rez dead group mates.  In order to go
where xp and loot are better you must also take greater risks, and
people *WILL* die.  The only reason we used to search for a cleric was
for their rezzes.  We had a basic trio of Mage/Ranger/Druid.  When
we wanted to pick up more and go dungeon crawling we picked up a cleric.
Not for their heals, for the rezzes.  If it were healing alone we needed
we'd far rather have picked up a shaman - vastly superior damage
mitigation and mana regen more than outweigh their lesser healing
efficiency.

I realize your 51 BL is your highest character, and I don't know how
much grouping you do in dangerous dungeons, but I have to assume from
your attitude about rezzes you don't know just how painful an unrezzed
death is at 59.  Given how easy it is to die in good zones, you take
a cleric or you don't go.  You take them for the rez.
