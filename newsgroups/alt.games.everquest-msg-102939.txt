I guess I missed the part in the article where it said "she went to
the lawyers".  Seems at least as likely that the scumsucking ambulance
chaser smelled an oportunity to gain some publicity and went looking
for her.  And even if she did go looking for a lawyer, any lawyer who
had a shred of self-respect or any slightest sense of social
responsibility wouldn't be taking this frivolous crap to court.  Sadly,
this restriction excludes less than 0.01% of the U.S legal profession
from taking her case.

You go ahead and slam a grieving parent for her irrational behavior.
Personally, I'll stick to blaming the calculating scumsucking parasites
of the ABA who daily make a mockery of our legal system.
