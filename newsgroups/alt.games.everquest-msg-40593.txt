Totally true as far as it goes.
You just have to remember that different level 10 mobs may be easier or
harder for you to kill.
Just cause they are both level 10 does not mean that they have the same
Hps, skills, attacks etc.

Some mobs are a blooming nightmare hand to hand, others are vicious
casters.
So you also have to factor in how you are fighting the mobs.

Then you get zone experience modifiers to add to the pot.

Eventually you end up knowing what mobs are "easy xp" for you and what
mobs are "easy pp" for you.

Ho humm.
