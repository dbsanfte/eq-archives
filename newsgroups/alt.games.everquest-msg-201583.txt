Hi All,

    I had an interesting experience the other night with my lev 10
enchanter. I was running back to kelethin after doing a CBC run and came
across a mature arborian. Being close to the orc lift I thought what the
heck I'll give it a go, and proceeded to get the crap beat out of me. I ran
to the lift thinking the guards would quickly dispatch the arborian but they
did nothing. I summoned the lift and got up to the platforms with the
arborian on my tail and he(it) proceeded to kill me. No guards came to my
aid. Are arborians not considered enemies in kelethin or what was the case
here?
