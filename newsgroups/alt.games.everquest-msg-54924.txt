It doesn't, really. The games are different enough that a useful
comparison is difficult.

Correct.

You can get the basic game (the 'original' world) for as little as ten
dollars. I understand that one of the gaming magazines is even
including a copy for free right now.

Once you get the game, you can try it out for one month (or ten days
with the magazine distributed copy) for free. If you decide it suits
you, you can continue to play for less than ten dollars a month after
that.

Frankly, I consider it to be one of the best entertainment values out
there. I've been playing for 2.5 years, and an still enjoying the
game.
