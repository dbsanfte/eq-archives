Solo, for all the pieces, I'd say level 40.  Then again, you can't really
get the mistmoore lute for the breastplate solo..

On big raids, with multiple groups, I find it very difficult to twist a lot
of songs due to the video lag caused by so many players, even with old
models on.  Nothing you can sing will make or break a raid, although your
resist songs on caster mobs can make a huge difference.  Just twisting
elemental+guardian rythyms (with drum) in those instances is very helpful.

It takes some practice to get the timing down, since AMP lasts a different
duration than our other songs, but incorporating it any time you have a
singing-skill song in the twist makes a big difference.  And like you said,
one pulse of cantana plus two pulses of manasong (amp'd) is a great downtime
twist.  You sound like you're going to be a fine bard (not as common as I'd
wish).
