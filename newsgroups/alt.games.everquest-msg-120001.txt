>What you ran into is classic bard/monk interaction.  

Mmmm this is only partially true.  Bard songs still have the ability to
do wonky things with aggro and a FD monk, but it's not nearly as wonky
as it used to be.  In fact the AoE mana song is the *only* song I can
think of in recent memory that has caused Very Bad Things to take place.
I've been able to FD and pull into song range and FD with all other
songs (even getting hit with DotB) with nary a problem (I still cringe
sometimes).  I play a 57 monk a lot with a 3-song-twisting-60 bard and
he's saved my ass more times than killed it from strange song bugs,
that's for sure.
