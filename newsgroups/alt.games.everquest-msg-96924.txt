Hard work ? Its a game. Perhaps you need a real job..
How on earth does not looking at a book for 35 levels make it easier harder
?
It simply is dang boring to stare at a book forever.
At least looking around at whats happening will maybe prevent folks PLing
past 35 so it isn't boring.

Not having a CR for the first 10 lvls. So what. Maybe people will actually
play those levels.
Then even go to an unused dungeon for more exp bonus and learn some skills
rather than oasis lake Dl routine then hit a dungeon.and sit in a wall
agroing the other side.

Isn't that what they are trying to fix. Too many twinks getting PL's
allready.
Why not make it appealing or rather take the pain away so players play the
levels rather than PL them.

So ?
First players to 50 were 2 rogues. Without hide and sneak working together.
And that means what exactly ? No changes ever ?

And you are missing the point. These changes I hope will fix that PL 2
machine incentive.
Make the lower levels fun and not so pain in the butt.

And what does that have to do with no CR for the first 10 lvls ? Or not
looking at a spell book.
WoW I think someone needs to call the WAhhhhhmbulence for ya.
