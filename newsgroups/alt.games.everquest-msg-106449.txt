You don't even need the wizard to come with you.  

I almost never ask strangers for ports.  I will ask a stranger for a
TL, but as a bard with AE manasong, it's not hard to find a wizard who
will TL if I help them med to full first.  
If you want to travel well in EQ, and you're not a porting/sowing
class, buy a stack or two of portal shards, stock up on SoW
potions/get T/J-boots, and learn to recognize wizards by name and
equipment.  If you bind in Nexes/Bazaar, you're really never more than
about 20 minutes from anywhere.  I've found that as long as I don't
log off in the ass-end of Norrath, I can usually log on, find out
where my raid or exp group is, and get a TL there much, much faster
than if I were to wait for a port-mule.
Print out the maps, learn the zones, get used to getting a TL and
running across 3 zones or whatever.  Everquest is fun when you can
travel well.
