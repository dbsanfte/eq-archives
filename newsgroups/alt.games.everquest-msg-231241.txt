Begging over ooc or tells seems to be happening more and more to me.

Whilst learning players often handed me pieces of armour or a weapon and it
was gratefully received but I never asked for this.

I have recently received tells from players who obviously know how to play
due to the rapid communication skills (it took me an age to work out all the
buttons) these tells are begging for money or equipment - so I give a little
why not I don't need horns of beast or a wooden shield these goods are worth
little to me now.

But when I think back most of my equipment in the early days was earnt
through quests or damn hard work and although I have given and still do to
be honest part of me wants to tell these guys to get lost and earn the goods
they want.

Is there a perceived etiquette to this? Is it to be frowned upon?
