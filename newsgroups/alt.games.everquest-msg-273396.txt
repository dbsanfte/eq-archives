Whew, glad you aren't. :)

I cannot claim that EQ has saved my life, but... I won't bore you with 
the details, but EQ addiction played a considerable part on me having to 
leave the USA -- and consequently, also on me chasing and eventually 
getting the dream job that I always had wanted, but was a little bit too 
comfortably settled down to pursue.

I'd also say that EQ has possibly made me a bit more assertive in real 
life, particularly in dealing with strangers. I count myself incredibly 
lucky in the fact that I've had to deal with a lot more idiots in EQ 
than I have in real life, and for those few occasions, the practice has 
been invaluable.

On the whole, I'd say EQ has had a pretty big effect on my life, 
although perhaps not entirely disproportionate to the amount of hours 
I've sunk into it. :)
