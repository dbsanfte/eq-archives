I have high and low level characters, and I fully intend to hunt in
the TCC zones when I'm of an appropriate level.  But then, and maybe
I'm the only one in the world like this, I try to always hunt in zones
of appropriate level - in lower level zones I get no experience, so
there's not much point, and in higher level zones I die and get
nothing, so again there's not much point. So I stick to appropriate
level zones, where I can survive and get experience. And guess what,
TCC doesn't impact me at all then.

Many of the reasons you gave amounted to "there won't be a high level
character around to save me". Well, Having started characters on
several servers the day they opened, and having played on the leading
edge of the level curve a few times, I can say that the game was still
plenty fun and not 'too hard' without some high level character
standing over me, and perhaps taking the loot before I could get to
it.
