They should do just the reverse. They should track every object and 
every sale and run an analysis to determine who is selling stuff and not 
getting suitable in-game returns and then investigate that character. 
And then simply remove the items from the people who bought them, If 
they bought cash then remove the cash from whoever they bought stuff off 
now saying that it was stolen money. The idea being to destroy the 
reputation of anyone who buys anything outside the game.
