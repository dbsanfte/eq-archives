The formula for a successful combine appears to be (skill * 1.15)-(Item
trivial -70)..
Sooo if you don't have a geerlock
191 times 1.15 is 190.
235 - 70 is 165.
The odds of success is 25%.

Any way a great site is
http://www.valendor.org/gumkak/

you can pick skill up methods cheap and slow or fast and exp.
he charts out odds and costs.
for example at 191 skill the gold fire opals go to 196 cost 63pp per combine
with a 93% success rate.
plat malachite 208-213 costs 105 plat with 71% success rate.
