Just to enter my two cents worth...

Used to have a problem with freezing too; I have the following:

AMD 1600XP (not overclocked)
512MB PC133 SDR
ASUS A7V133 MB
Radeon 7500

Could only run the computer for a few minutes or, like you said - a few
hours, before it would freeze.  Then got a new (and larger) CPU fan and heat
sink.  Has been running fine now.  Had to run with the cover slightly
cracked before, now all covers are on and running at 1.41 GHz like it
should.  There is a LOT to be said about air movement and such for what seem
to be MB problems are actually CPU heat problems....

Thanks for the ear...

 - Jon
