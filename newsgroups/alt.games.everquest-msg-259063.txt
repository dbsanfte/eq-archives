True, but I bet someone would pay it.  I'd donate that much for a rez, I 
could easily see paying that much to skip a trip to SK.  They -are- only 
fit to give to pets, but they're really, really, fun to give to pets when 
you're farming stunnable caster-type mobs.  Most of my pet class 
characters keep a couple handy.  Still, I probably personally wouldn't pay 
more than 50pp, but I'm a cheapskate. :)
