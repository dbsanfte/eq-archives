Hm. I have a couple of friends who run druid alts who say they make 
quite decent money on ports.

A guildie the other day told me it takes 5pp and change to make one sow-
potion, and sells the 10-doses to us 'at cost' for 50pp (although I give 
her 60 to balance out the 'and change', don't want her going broke on us 
greedy sow-addicts)

After fighting there today I'll damn well pp em all >:(  I set up an 
/assist only hotkey because everytime I'm there I see kiters complaining 
that people should assist to make sure nobody was already on it.  I'd 
see a giant, con it, then run up to it, smashing 'assist' all the way.  
Nobody it hated, bam, I'd slap it and start running back with the thing 
on my tail, and halfway back to camp my giant would disappear, snared or 
rooted by, yes, a kiter.  Needless to say this got old fast.  I made 
damned sure to thank the one guy I saw back off as I pulled something, 
though.

Necros do it better. *strut*

That's because we hate you casters for getting all the money from 
ports/rezzes/quad-kiting-giants-we-couldn't-kill-if-we-were-buffed-and-
god-like. ;p  (Well, maybe a monk could.  Haven't seen their soloing 
skill yet.)
