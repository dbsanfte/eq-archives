I was unable to cast on someone (well, I was able to cast on them...they
didn't receive it) no more than a week ago after they started dueling and
decided to end it before death.

Same thing about 2 months ago.

The only ways that I'm aware of to end a duel is for someone to die or zone.
I'd love to find out there's a third way but I haven't found it yet (but
then again, after 2 years I think I've dueled twice).
