No, you have completely mis-read me. I have played since August of 99.
Leveling is obviously NOT my priority if I only have 3 characters at
level 51-53. I played those characters until I no longer enjoyed
playing them. Leveling up to 50+ was a side-effect of playing them.
Yes, that "wall" was the 50s. It is not the speed of leveling (or
rather the post-50 slowdown), that I can't stand. It is the huge
time-sink and the change of focus that happens once you enter the
post-50 world.

From a purely game mechanics point of view EQ post 50 is far different
than 1-50. To "accomplish" anything (crawl a level appropriate
dungeon, or help a friend with an Epic or other level appropriate
quest) you need at least 1-2 solid groups, and several hours
(sometimes even days). If you try to play casually (only 1-2 hours a
night), you will find yourself camping out when your friends/guild
have just barely organized and reached their "camp-spot" (zone or area
in a zone) for the evening.

You also need to devote a large amount of time to gathering adaquate
gear so that you can raid the "cool" zones (farming faction/quest
gems, resist gear, collecting keys, etc, etc). So more often than not
you wind up in the same zones as all of the other 50+ players on your
server, competing for the same mobs/drops. Again if you play casually
you will not be able to put in enough time to gather these items. Sure
your friends/guild could gather them for you, but then you find
yourself becoming a free-loader. Nothing spoils the atmosphere more
than heading to Dungeon_X and finding every major spawn camped. It's
even more fun when you have to plan ahead and make an appointment
before you can raid a zone or take down Uber_Mob_01. One advantage to
the lower levels is the under-utilization of the low-mid level
dungeons.

I personally do not enjoy the change in game-play and focus post-50 so
I choose to start over and try something new. How quickly/slowly
characters level post-50 is of little concern to me.

I have spent most of my EQ time hunting with friends or in pick-up
groups. I am more interested in the social aspects of the game. I am
not interested in "phat lewt" or the pursuit of "uber-gear" (which
more often than not damages the social aspect of the game).
Unfortunately that is what most of the 50-60 game is all about. There
is a lot of pressure to "keep up" and not hold-back your friends or
guild. At this point EQ becomes more like work to me, than a game.

If all I cared about was leveling, I would never take a character past
level 10. The recent changes to the "newbie-levels" are perfect for
people who get a high off of the "DING!" sound :-)

I think we can agree to disagree. There is plenty of room for both
your style of play and mine. I think that is what sets EQ apart from
the other MMPRPGs.
