My understanding is you can't use this 'til 45, so yeah, 100 a click, 6 
sec cast time, it's pretty good, you're gonna loose 2 songs in your 
twist for using it, but it's much easier to do that while soloing than 
singing all your heal songs that stack... generally it's compared to 
Fungi tunic, which is inate regen, and fungi + a couple songs = SSBP. 
Check out the armor forums on www.eqdiva.com for many a discussion of 
the difference between these.
