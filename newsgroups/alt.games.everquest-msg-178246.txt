    So sad, I woke up this morning to my mother knocking on my door and
telling me what happened.  My feet are still cold because I was out in my
front yard taking my flag down.  Sadly I don't have a full flag pole so I
can't fly at half mast.

    What I hope to see come out of this tragedy is more unity then ever in
the space program.  This program is one of the few that give such hope for
international cooperation, it would be a shame to see strife between people
because of this.  The first Israeli, an Indian born and trained (but an
American citizen), and more diversity, but still one crew.  Yes, this is a
horrible tragedy, but if one steps back and looks at the range of people
affected by this, it's rather inspiring, how many people are saddened by
this loss.  I know I am.
