That all depends on where you want to get? yes?

Personally I see you as what I call a "Power Gamer"..  Need all the
best.  My guild often does stuff all week, but this "stuff" does not
always include raiding. 
 The Higher end of the game is entirely about raiding you say...  I
couldn't disagree with you more.  The Entire game is about doing what
You want to do.  That is some peeps are all about end game encounters.
There are others that are total freaks over trade skills (shudder).
There are others that enjoy the lower end game much more.  

The guild you are looking for is the one that best fits your play
style.  My guild is more of a family guild.   do we have and 65's in
our guild?  no, but we do have several that are 63.   

A good example of what I am talking about is.  My wife has a very good
friend on our server.  This guy was one of the more Known traders...
he only sold items worth 30 k or more etc.  The Local UBER guild had
been recruiting him for a bit, so he gave em a whirl and  joined them,
and came to find out he didn't care for their ethics and play style.
RAID RAID RAID RAID..... and he was "expected" to be at all raids...
Sooo... he left em.

As I said, its all about your play style and time that determines what
guild will be right for you.  

If you see a guild you feel good about, group with the peeps, and if
you still feel good, request an invite.  and if things go south and
you decide your not ment to be there, well Just leave.  No laws
requiring you to stay around.

Good hunting to ya.
