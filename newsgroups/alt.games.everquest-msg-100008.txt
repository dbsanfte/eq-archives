Because con is only the xp and sometimes level value of a mob but has
little to do with difficulty. One blue can be much harder than another
blue, or even a green. If you are a 47 ranger I bet a scarlet cheetah
in scarlet desert would own you even if it was light blue, it hits
like a mack truck and has a whopping load o' hp.

Many people get "owned" by Dorn in nro, possibly even when he is a
green con to some characters. This isn't really a "miss con", but just
a harder mob. 

Con color value is a very poor measure of how difficult a mob might
be, rather it just is an approximation of the mobs difficulty for a
GROUP (possibly even a full group) Dorn and this shardwurm then are
not "MISS" cons; it would actually be more accurate to say that rygorr
orc is since it would be blue to a group but very easy. If you fought
a shardwurm when it was blue and had a druid, warrior and cleric in
tow you'd think it was easy.

Verant has responded on the issue before and that is pretty much what
they say. The other thing they say is that if con was a totally safe
way to know when you can and can't beat a mob that it would make the
game pretty boring and you'd lose a sense of danger and
experimentation. The young shardwurm is harder but you can always run.

If this issue bothers you now, wait until you are 56 like my druid..
then it becomes a question of experimentation along MUCH more
dangerous lines of "hmm I wonder if this blue mob SUMMONS or not?" You
don't know until you try or you read about how it does.
