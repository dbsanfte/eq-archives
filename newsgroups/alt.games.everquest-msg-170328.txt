My main is lvl 30 so I guess you could say this doesn't apply to me... but
I've maxed my Sense Heading skill on all my chars just in case I ever need
it and so far I've never, ever needed it... and I've hunted with a lot of
people.  About the only place I use it is in the Nexus to figure out which
way to go to get to the wing I want.  When I'm in a zone, especially when
I'm hunting, I move and run and turn so much that Sense Heading tells me
pretty much exactly nothing about where to go.  If I were moving in exactly
a straight line then I guess I could just turn around and head back the
other way, but I'm usually *not* moving in a straight line.  And in most
zones, if I just remember which side of the zone something is and run to
that side (using Sense Heading) and wander back and forth looking for it,
I'm likely to get aggroed by something I run across and possibly die.  Sense
Heading could be useful if you're just so hopelessly lost that you
desperately need *some* sort of guideline on where to go -- kind of like
/loc.  Otherwise it's a lot more useful, not to say more reliable, to look
for landmarks, and maybe use a bit of Sense Heading just to make sure you're
looking at the right landmark.
