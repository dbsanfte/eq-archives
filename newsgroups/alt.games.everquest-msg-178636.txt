Perhaps you should check your reading comprehension level. Nowhere did
I say anything about mourning or lack thereof or about scorn. I simply
stated that dying while doing something you love is better then dying
while doing something you don't. I think your wrong, dying in bed
surrounded by loved ones is not the thing most people would choose.
Saying goodbye to your family is nice but making them wait and watch
you die is inflicting needless pain on them and most people wouldn't
want to do that.
