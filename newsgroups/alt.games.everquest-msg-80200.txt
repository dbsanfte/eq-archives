Sorry.  I come from the "get a bigger hammer" school of training and
machinery repair; subtlety has never been my strong suit.  I guess you
consider my statement the summary.

For the record, the problem I have with anarchy is that power abhores a
vacuum.  If there is no authority, then the most capable party that desires
will become one.  That, alone, does not speak well of said capable party's
character.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
