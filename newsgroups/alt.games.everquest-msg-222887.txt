I can't right click on an empty spell slot to get my selection of
spells, I can't right click on my spell book to get my
prememorized spell lists.  Its pretty annoying.

I talked to a friend who was on same server and NOT having this
problem, which doesnt' surprise me since there aren't 50 AGE here
complaining about it.

I'll reboot and log back on see if its cleared up.
