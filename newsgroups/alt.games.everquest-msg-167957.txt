Same thing goes for Clerics performing Rez's.  However, I never ask for the
coin upfront (directly).  I usually sit there for a couple of seconds giving
them the opportunity to pay.  But if they do not show any action then I go
ahead a cast the spell then I wait for the payment.  However, while
performing services for PC's you have to remember it is just like in
real-life with Taxi Drivers.  Sometimes, the passenger just doesn't pay, and
that is when that passenger gets "black-listed".  If someone cheats you out
of a payment for services tell your guild and keep a record of who doesnt
and does pay.  I do this for rez's and it works out well because for those
who have requested my services more than a couple of times I will give them
a discount or even in some cases where I do not need the plat I cancel the
trade and tell them that, "it was on me this time".
