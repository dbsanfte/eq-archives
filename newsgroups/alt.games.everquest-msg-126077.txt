Tough to put in a single order, because some require strategy, some
require luck and some require sheer numbers

Drop Tunare right down - The only 'difficulty' is the mindnumbing
boredom involved in clearing the zone. She should not be mentioned in
the same list as the rest up there.

I think it also depends on your guild makeup and experience on a mob.
We've done AoW without a single death, and last Cursed we lost a wiz and
necro, but other than pullers, no-one else died. Last Creator we had to
res people back in because someone fell off the podium and brought back
golems and snakes galore. Experience and strategy negate a lot of the
difficulty of a mob, while bad luck can fubar even the best laid plans

Blood himself should be way down, but his guards push him back up. First
attempt we were surprised how quickly he fell, but his guards ate us up.
Second time, we occupied the guards perfectly and killed Blood without a
death, then Emp ripped us a new one. Next time we'll take what we
learnt, adapt, and see how that goes. 

Some guilds find toe-to-toe fights like AoW much easier than tactical
fights, while others excel at quick-thinking tactical fights without the
pure power for some toe-to-toes
