Velium Gemmed are considerably worse than the top luclin weapons, and
frankly buying shite in the bazaar:

    a) is the most boring way to gear up I've ever heard of.
    b) is nowhere near good enough to keep tabs on a raider unless you're
doing some seriously freaky grouping - we're talking 2-3k+ HP and 800-1k AC
difference for a tank.

I hate buying overpriced crap in the bazaar in order to vaguely keep up -
but before I cancelled I was doing just that. My favorite way to get upgrade
drops is to group for them, 2nd best would be raids that my guild is
actually capable of. The bazaar, LDoN etc however meant that my guild rarely
hit anything that dropped upgrades for me - in fact Kuloth is wearing not
one single upgrade that dropped on a raid, despite spending several months
attending 1-2 per weekend with 20-30 other people competing for drops and NO
other SK's...

Just to re-iterate, I don't want to be on par with the uberguild folk who
raid daily, however having to spend a couple of hundred grand a year buying
upgrades so I can remain more than 3,000hp and 800AC behind a tank with
similar or lesser skills gives me the shits.
