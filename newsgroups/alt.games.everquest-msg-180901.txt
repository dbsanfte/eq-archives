I think it has something to do with moving, when you are moving your
swings miss a lot more.  What I like to do when a mob is running away is
turn off auto attack, get right behind the bast.. er.. mob.. wait for
the autoattack button to ungrey, stop moving and double click the
autoattack button.    You can also just leave autoattack on, but try to
time stopping for a moment so your swing lands when you are stopped. 
Both of these seem to work much better than just running after a mob,
but still no where near as well as just beating on it when it's standing
still.  There is a risk you will be out of range when your attack lands
doing either of these though. 

There is still a negative to AC on mobs from behind, which is why I like
to get on the opposite side of the MT when beating on something, or
opposite a rogue if there is one to help them get the bonus.  

Unfortunately EQ mobs are made Uber to compensate for AI stupidity, but
it balances out.  Mobs have the intelligence of an insect (if that) but
the strength of 10.  We have the intelligence of a person, but only the
strength of one (well unless you are uber twinked at low levels). 
Personally I'd much prefer a system where mobs were equal to the
players, and just have a lot more of them to compensate for AI
stupidity, or the oportunity to play the monsters and give the PCs a big
suprise once in awhile.  Of course this would require some serious
reworking of some things like the death penalties.
