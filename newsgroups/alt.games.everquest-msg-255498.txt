SOE's made a lot of changes in the three months or so I was out, and in the
interim I ended up with a brand spanking new box.  So some aspects have been
like playing a new game, but one where I know the ropes from the start.

Another thing that seems to have helped is something I wasn't counting on.
I abandoned all guild ties when I quit.  I didn't think it was fair to
either guild I was in to leave my characters tagged.  As it turns out, one
guild in particular was part of the problem.

It had gotten to the point in the one guild that before I quit I never
played my tagged characters anyway.  Invariably, as soon as I logged in, I'd
get multiple tells insisting (not asking, insisting) that I switch to a
different character because "We need the ranger's DPS" or "We need the druid
for heals".  That guild is still to this day raiding wannabes, and I despise
raiding.

I hated to bring any character tagged in that guild up, because my gaming
time would consist of hours on CRs.  No, check that ... I'd spend hours
watching TV while someone else tried to get my corpse out from under the
boss mob du jour.  (Dira, if you're out there, I'm not referring to DA, not
LoT).

I'm now in a new guild with a much more relaxed feel.  My 60 druid is the
highest levelled character out there, so there's not the constant pressure.
Quite frankly, I didn't realize how much this one thing negatively affected
my attitude until I came back last week.  With that one guild out of my
hair, the game for me is a much happier place.  Go figure.

I'm probably going to beta Tabula Rasa when the time comes.  It looks
interesting, and I figure as well as the launch of CoH went NCSoft may be on
to something.  That, plus the fact that it's Lord British's new project, is
enough for me to at least give it a shot.  I'll drop five bucks to EB, and
if I don't like well enough to subscribe I can use the five bucks somewhere
else in the store.  That's what I did with CoH.

I may well do the same with The Matrix Online ... I haven't decided quite
yet.  There's a lot of room to mess that one up.
