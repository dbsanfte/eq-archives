Cleric can also heal necro as a means of feeding mana to him.  Or necro 
snare, cleric fear, and necro pet plus cleric chase mob down meleeing; 
in the twenties cleric melee is still fairly good, given the wealth of 
weaponry out there due to mudflation, capable of doing far better damage 
than "intended" back when most of the zones that people in their 20s 
play in.  Would a "real" melee do more damage?  Probably, due to the 
same mudflation effect, but cleric melee is still going to be quite 
good, particularly in a fear kite situation.

At 39 a cleric gets Cheal.  For Cheal to be effective, you only need a 
big enough tank.  A 60s level necro has pets that are plenty big enough 
as tanks, although to really get full use out of Cheal, the necro could 
instead charm something undead and let it go to town; charmed mobs tend 
to do far more damage and have much higher HP totals than real pets.  I 
never tried this particular branch of charming out, but I'd be surprised 
if a necro couldn't get the same sort of milage that a druid (who can 
only charm animals) can out of a cleric, which is to say Cheals that 
land for the full 7500hp (8000?  Been a long time) instead of the paltry 
4000 or so that you tend to get on even the best PC tanks.

But thats not the only radical idea.  Since the necro will not get 
really good exp anywhere outside POP zones, leveling up the cleric to 46 
should be a priority.  Forget Duoing, PL the cleric, it won't take long.

Plan A: Necro nearly kills something (preferably with nukes so there's 
no lingering damage production to interfere), then FD's, cleric finishes 
it off and gets the exp.  Dunno if this works, only tried it with a monk 
and even that was spotty

Plan B: Necro nearly kills undead mob, then charms it, break charm, 
cleric kills it.  This will certainly work, charm is 100% mem blur, 
except that the mob hates the charmer with a fury (but does not remember 
any damage done)

Plan C: Cleric melees undead mobs to death, necro plays "shaman", 
slowing the mobs and healing the cleric.  Bonus here is that the only 
mobs the necro can slow are also the ones the cleric will do the most 
damage to.  If possible the necro should be casting his HP sucking 
spells on the mobs, assuming he isn't outdamaging the cleric doing so.

Beauty of plan C is that it helps the cleric cap out his defense and 
melee skills.   Defense is a key skill for clerics later, when mobs are 
capable of delivering a massive beating any time they get accidental 
heal aggro, and 1hb is a very nice skill to have from 54 to 60 or so 
when their summoned hammer makes them a viable melee force (something 
they haven't been since their 40s, and won't be post 60), and Bash is a 
very handy skill on some encounters such as POD cleric spiders, who 
Cheal themselves but are immune to stun.

Get cleric to 46 and you can do teir one planes.  PON has undead in it, 
so thats probably your best pick.  Get some 60s friends together and get 
the cleric thru a POJ trial and you can do POV/POS... there are undead 
in POV that the necro can do with cleric help and get astounding exp.

Something to think about while cleric is still low level; Lord Bergurgle 
  and the goblins around his spawn are still DB to him, and maybe even 
the ones around Lord Grimblox in Sol A (maybe too late for that 
already); while not the best PLing available, this is a very worthwhile 
pair of chores to tackle, and Bergurgle hunting will find DMF handy 
stuff.  Then Skyfire mountains, again sadly free of undead, will be 
another worthwhile way to spend time, gathering the four pearlescent 
fragments you'll eventually need.  Everything else in the cleric epic is 
straightforward, only those three camps involve endless time spent 
camping either a rare pop or picking up rare drops.
