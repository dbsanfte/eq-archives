That's how I did it. Working on smithing, and had a full suit of small
bronze, also a Mith 2 hander (IIRC.. That's the haste one, right?) in my
pack beside a SBS I picked up from a Crushbone player to complete the
set.
 I found a young Dwarf in some patchwork and some dropped cloth armor
battling on Orc Hill. When he sat to rest, I dropped it all on him in a
couple of tailored 10-slot backpacks.

I thought he was gonna faint. :D
