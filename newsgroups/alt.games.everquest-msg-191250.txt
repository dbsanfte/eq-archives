I have a LinkSys 4-port Cable/DSL Router, and the first thing I did was go
to their website and get the latest firmware patch. The second thing I did
was change the default password. If you forget your new password you can use
the recessed reset button to reset it to default, don't know if you will
have to repatch again.

I have zero problems with the router, although my cable company is another
matter. You might want to investigate that.
