   Well, there's PL'ving and then there's PL'ving.  I'm PL'ving Lenny
right now, but we basically what we are doing is having me buff his HPs
up with Temp, then letting him kill whatever, with me keeping him
healed, and stepping in if it looks like we bit off more than we can
chew (rare).  He is working on all his weapon and melee skills, and some
of his casting skills (abjuration, divination, and  evocation are being
neglected though... some of that will have to change when he hits 30 and
gets feign death and invisibility).

   I don't really understand the motivation of using PL'ving techniques
that leave the victim total crippled when they do get to the higher
levels.  I want Lenny to be useful when he finally does catch up to me.  

   Oh, and to go off topic for a bit, he is glad that he rerolled from a
warrior to a shadowknight.
