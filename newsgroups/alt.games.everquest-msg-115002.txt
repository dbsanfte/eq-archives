No, but like I said, if he doesn't have enough of an understanding of
the Internet to know about routers and such, he isn't qualified to
blame it on bad programming. If he knew anything about programming
online games, he'd know that bad programming is NOT the source of his
problem.

Idiots making wild assumptions when they don't have enough knowledge
to make said claims irritate me.
