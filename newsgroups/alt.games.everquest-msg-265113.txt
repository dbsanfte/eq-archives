Thanks Lance, I was thinking of adding a language question to the FAQ,
and your reply will be a good starting point, especially since I had
no personal experience with languages on FV.  (Though I did start a
character there just long enough to verify that humans speak "Human"
instead of "Common", since somebody recently questioned that part of
the FAQ.)

One item I think is worth adding, is that /lang # can be tricky if you
have multiple chat windows.  You need to do the /lang # in your Main
Chat, otherwise it won't affect any hotkeys you have that speak text.
I *think* that /lang # in a different window will affect /say, /g, /t,
etc. typed *in that window*, but I'm not entirely sure.  (It's hard to
tell, because you can always see your own text clearly.)  I should do
some experiments with that before adding the Q to the FAQ.
