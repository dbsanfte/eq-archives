Obviously.  He says.  But I'm thinking about this, and its not obvious 
to me.  If its been fixed, then why NOT tell us what the methods were?

A) they've been fixed, so nobody will be able to take advantage of the 
method

B) Knowing what they were would stop a lot of speculation

C) Knowing that they consider specific methods to be cheating would help 
us know to avoid other, similar methods, AND help us know that they want 
to be notified of them

D) Knowing which methods have been fixed would let those who know about 
them and are driven by the request here to report them know they don't 
need to bother; thus improving the signal to noise ratio in the reports 
they are going to have to sift thru looking for more cheats.

I know, you are thinking "how can you not know its a cheat?"  Well, take 
for example the shaman epic.  Almost every step in the epic generates 
faction, and most dead end other than that.  Do early steps, generate 
sufficient faction to do later steps, and so forth, till you have 
sufficient faction for the final step.  Now it seems clear to -me- that 
one approach would be to do early steps repeatedly, in order to skip 
some of the later steps.  Even if you wanted to do every step, there 
certainly seems to be no harm, and perhaps some help, in doing some of 
those steps repeatedly, getting more faction as a safety margin (some 
have reported failure due to insufficient faction despite following all 
the steps).  Further, its possible to blow some of the early steps and 
be forced to repeat.  All that though, has been stomped on by the "cheat 
police" who feel that doing anything other than each step, one time, is 
an effort to cheat and must be stopped.  SO if your faction is too high, 
you fail the quest!  And of course there's no way to tell where your 
faction actually is precisely enough to tell if you can complete the 
quest, other than to try the final handin.

Knowing that this is something they consider a cheat would be a lot of 
help to unsuspecting shamans in the future, and to anyone else who has 
been working on faction to achieve any goal by doing something repeatedly.

Of course it seems like nonsense, but if nobody will even explain the 
descision then its very hard to argue with it.  Things will just change 
and nobody will be able to figure out why!

Splendid
