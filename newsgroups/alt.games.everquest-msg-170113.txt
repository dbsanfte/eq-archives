I feel sorry for the people under 55 now, cos it seems just about all the
old xp haunts are empty. I had a wander around... I was the only person in
velks. I went up to ME. just one other person there... some wizzy quad
kiting. Since then I got pop, so I go to pon... 90 something people.
Memories of south karana in the old days. Just about every old world zone i
run through is completely empty now, with a couple of exceptions. Come to
think of it tho, oasis was empty the other day.
