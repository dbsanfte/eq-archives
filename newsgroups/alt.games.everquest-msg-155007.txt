Hmmn - I can't figure out if you are pointing out that it is an equal
tragedy if a life is lost regardless of where they are from or actually do
believe it is worse that westerners got whacked for whatever reason.

I choose to read it as the former and not the latter because otherwise I
would be compelled to launch into a diatribe containing multiple instances
of the words "fuckwit", "shithead" and new favourite "fucktard".
