I'd say in DT's case he's told that by people that have absolutely zero
desire to exploit his services...

70/45 > 100/70

Was your point to say that the adventures weren't properly tuned?

Beyond that, I've fought in the planes and plenty of LDoN adventures.  All
my in-game friends agree, LDoN has put the fun back into grinding, "it
doesn't matter that the exp isn't quite as good".  But then all these guys
are working on their triple-digit AAs, so they're willing to trade off the
best experience for a better "experience".  :)

I can make 2k an hour in Rathe Mtns.  LDoN DON'T DO THAT!   :P

Really?  I give the LDoN drops away to random people, or destroy them when I
can't find anyone willing to take them.  Sure as hell couldn't expect to
make any money selling this crap on my server.

So you've gotten stuff that nobody else has seen yet?  Neat.  There's some
stuff that's "comparable" to planar toys, and some stuff that's "close", but
I have yet to see anything that puts planar drops to shame.

It really does sound like you're the perfect fit for such a crowd though...

Yes, to stay at the top of the leaderboard.  Or don't you grasp the concept
behind "uber guild types"?
