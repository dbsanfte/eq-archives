I usually ask necros when they want healing.  IF they don't 'reply for some
reason or wimp with their answer I say this:  NECRO: I'll heal you at 40% OR if
you are under attack and crashing hard.  Sound good?
I don't have too many necros die on me, but then I've played with several
really good ones.  Experience = all.
