Its been a while since this was an issue, the Guild Lobby off POK 
includes  a guy who will summon your body for you, for a fee tuned to 
your level range.  It just doesnt' take hours and hours to get your body 
back.

But then it rarely ever did; few zones require all that much effort to 
get within dragging range of a corpse, almost none of the low level 
zones do; Befallen and Blackburrow, perhaps.

And Necromancers get a Summon Corpse spell at low levels, SK get one at 
a level not that much higher, bodies are recoverable if you've made the 
effort to make friends even on a casual basis, or if you're good at 
making a fair offer in general chat.

   At some point I realized

At low levels, the amount of exp you lose on a death is so trivial that 
its usually not worth losing all your mana to take a rez.  In the mid 
levels, you can get a 50% or 70% etc rez if you group with a cleric, 
which is part of the "bait" to induce you to do so; this is, after all, 
a class that doesnt' work and play all that well on its own.  Joining a 
guild is also something thats encouraged by subtle means such as a 
higher likelyhood of access to Summon Corpse and high level Rez help.

  So all your talk about "taking a

Sounds like WoW has stiffer penalties for death than EQ does, then, 
unless you're a hard core soloer with no friends and no willingness to 
pay for help.  Even eating dying, summoning your body to the guild 
lobby, and not getting a rez at all, doesn't cost much, a half hour's 
exping and about the same in gathering cash to replentish the "summon my 
body" slush fund.  And again, there aren't that many zones even in the 
higher levels where you'll have difficulty getting to your body... 
particularly amusing are the POP zones which each have a Graveyard where 
your body will appear after a short duration if you haven't gotten to it 
yet.

"A LOT?"  Not likely.

Oh, and there's the Shadowrest option too; after seven days untouched, 
your body will show up in a special recovery zone, so even if you have 
no cash or have to go offline for a very long period of time, there's no 
longer any chance whatsoever you'll lose all your gear.
