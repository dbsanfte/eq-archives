I probably wouldn't even be in EQ anymore if it weren't for my guild.  I
certainly would have left the Raithe for Stormhammer without it.  Since my
guild wasn't going, neither was I.  Of course, Tempters is a close guild,
for the most part.  I know half the guild personally, since most of us are
in the Hampton Roads area.

Heh, it only sucks when you're a bard.  Most of my guild knows not to expect
any replies from me when Tenjou is logged on, though.

Different perspective.  My entire reason for trying to level is so I can be
of more use to my guild.  It was a great feeling when I was able to help my
guild leader get a Charred Guardian Shield (since the EXG is magic resistant
and she, being a druid, needed a pet Paladin).  Or when I said "Hey, I just
killed this SK and got Envy and Woe... anyone know what they're for?"  And
our shaman nearly fell out of his chair.

Well, the drama does get old at times.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
