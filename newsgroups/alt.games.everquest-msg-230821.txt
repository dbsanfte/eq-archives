You know, as much as we (in general) bitch about this game, it can be
quite beautiful at times.   There are some parts of the game that can
literally take your breath away.  Unfortunately we don't often see it
due to a limited environment (parked at X camp waiting for static
spawn, or the current newbie experience of Newbie zone->PC->HHK).

I'm a little guilty of that myself.  My early EQ life was largely as a
cleric (this is pre-velious), so most of what I saw was my spellbook.
Until LDoN opened, I really had little use for Faydwer, and had hardly
seen that either.  

To this end I started up a newbie ranger about a month ago for the
express purpose of seeing the world and doing some soloing.  Well,
that, and to forage for some tradeskill supplies.  Anways, I had at
least one goal to take him down to the wide open plains of The
Overthere, and track and kill a sabretooth tiger.  Mission
accomplished.

Wandering through Warslik's woods for the first time ever, standing on
the top of a hill looking out over the forest below, with a haze of
mist in the distance, I was really taken with the beauty of the
scenery.  So I spent the better part of the evening guzzling SoW
potions and running through zones I had barely glimpsed before.

So, I guess the question is, do the rest of you have some 'favorite
spots', or visuals from the game that you really enjoy?  The kind of
thing that makes you just stop and take a look, and a bunch of
screenshots?

Let me know, I'll be in Warsliks
