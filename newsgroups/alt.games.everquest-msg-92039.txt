If you have Velious, hit Iceclad and quad-kite cougars. Takes some
practice, but once you get it down, quadding is the fastest xp you can
pull. Trick is finding either 4 of the same mob or 4 that'll move at
the same speed and getting them all snared and packed together.
Lightning Strike's radius is kinda small, so you have to keep them all
in a tight pack.
