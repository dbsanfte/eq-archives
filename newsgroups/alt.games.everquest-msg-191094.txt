Well I don't agree with that really.  I mean there was no context for PVP in
UO which was their biggest problem.  This game has context built in from the
start beginning with the game's lore, and followed by GvG combat.  I've been
playing it for about 3-4 months now and even now after release when you'd
normally see the griefers running wild I've only ever been attacked once
without knowing the reason.  I know that people are all under the belief
that it's a griefer's dream, and maybe it could be, but it just doesn't seem
to be the case.  I think the very fact that most people join guilds and are
in sizable groups the majority of the time hurts a person's "griefability".
I mean it's tough to either A) walk in and kill someone and walk out before
getting killed yourself, and B) Get enough of your griefer friends together
to eliminate this group.

Personally I just can't find a more challenging opponent than a live person
and that's why I love PvP in MMORPG's, but I love it most when the roles are
clearly defined as to who hates who, and why our side is against their side.
I mean in UO EVERYONE knew that an ogre or an orc was an enemy.  Did it
really matter that it was AI or not?  The problem was that when a player saw
another player it was not immediately known to them if they were an enemy or
not (well you could examine them to see if they were a dread lord, but at
first glance it wasn't obviuos).  In SB if I'm an Irekei I know that elves
can be harmful to my character since they do hate me.  Granted many people
probably aren't familiar with the lore at all, but I play on a server with
many roleplaying guilds and this has really helped quite a bit.
