You -don't- have anything else to go on.  Those who have been there, done that
(or even who've died trying repeatedly, or even who -could- try but haven't
yet, and are of the right level range to have had to make that descision) -do-
have more to go on.

Have you ever had sex?  Before you did, did you think you knew all about it?
In retrospect, did you?

When you see a lot of people saying that you -don't- get what trials and the
tier one/tier two split represent, and in particular when at least two of us
are draw to precisely this parallel, do you ever consider the possiblility
that people who have been there may know more than someone who has only read
about it?

If you are still a virgin sexually, well I mean no disrespect, and
congradulations or condolences whichever you wish, but it would make it easier
to understand why this particular point isn't getting thru to you.

I imagine we can come up with other examples of something you can remember
never having done, and then later doing and seeing things differently, if we
think about it.
