Actually, exp at level 60 moves a bit faster than exp at level 56.  It is 
about 1/3 the exp rate of level 45*.  It just seems so much faster after 
that hell that is 59 (or so I'm told, still stuck at 59).  Of course it's 
much easier to not die at 60, since you have rather non-linear reductions 
in aggro and such.
