	If its just a memory leak, there are RAM managing programs 
out there ya could run in the background which clear up ram 
that programs were 'suppposed' to clear up but never did.  I 
can't remember the name of any of 'em, but my roommate uses 
the one I once used for a game he needs it for and I could 
ask him the name if you can't find one (the one he uses is a 
very old one I still happened to have, so there are probably 
much newer and better ones around now anyhow).       He has 
my old video card (geforce 4 ti 4200) and needs the ram 
manager for the free trial version of DAOC that comes on a 
cd (and includes shrouded isles).  I had the same card, same 
mobo, same o/s as my machine till recently and didn't need a 
memory manager w/the game, but I had the retail version.  I 
suspect the problem is something else though because he 
still crashes, though w/the memory manager things run a lot 
smoother and it takes a lot longer till the crash occurs, so 
maybe he's right.  He's still narrowing down the 
possibilities though so we'll see.
	Anyhow, the memory manager would probably cause a little 
chug every time it cleared up a large chunk of ram, but 
that'd be better than crashing or having to reboot.
	So if that is the problem it may well be fixable.  Well, 
not fixable, but work-around-able, band-aid style till they 
fix it on their end.
	Actually, just did a search and found hte name of the one I 
gave my roommate - memturbo, some old version of it I'm 
sure.  There are a bunch out there that are 'free to try', 
and some tat are free, so no harm tryin' a few out at any 
rate.  Just look up 'memory manager' at download.com.  In 
the very least it might do for you what it did for my 
roommate, give ya a lot more time before the crash (he went 
from crashing in 10 minutes to lasting a couple hours before 
a crash, plus the game runs much more smoothly all the way 
up until the crash).
