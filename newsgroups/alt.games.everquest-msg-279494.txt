That one you have to be careful of:  Is a 65% slow really only 5% 
worse than a 70% slow?

(these are pop level spells, I don't know the OoW ones)

On a 100DPS mob the 70% slow makes it a 30DPS mob, the 65% slow
makes it a 35DPS mob - the tank tanking the BL slowed mob is taking
16.666% more damage.

With Shaman it's even more dramatic:  The shaman slowed 100DPS mob 
only puts out 25DPS, so the tank tanking the BL slowed mob is taking
40% more damage than if it were shaman slowed.

Additionally, shaman have a very low aggro un-resistable debuff to 
help them land their slow.

When mobs are near the limit of a group's ability, the difference 
betwen shaman slows and BL slows is huge.  

In the sewers it was very common to get resisted the first time and
have to recast and take some hits.  And that's with my mage backing 
me up with Mala/Malosini.  Fortunately I could just use my disc and
tank it until I got it slowed.

I have been primary slower, haster, stat-buffer in exp groups many
times with my BL.  It means I don't use nukes, but that is the price
of being able to even handle those tasks at all.  The ability to trade
off DPS for utility, then switch back when we gain a shaman is huge.

Ooops, should have read your entire response - this is precisely the
point:  My BL didn't DPS as well as my mage, slow/buff as well as a
shaman or tank as well as a plate class -- but I could step into each
of these roles and fill them "well enough" in standard XP groups.

Actually, this is the primary problem for both mages and BL's --
pets simply don't scale with gear the way melee DPS/mitigation
does.  Moreover for mages, caster DPS doesn't scale as well with
gear.

This leads to the syndrome (for mages at least) of looking REALLY
good when an expansion first comes out (ding 61, get a PoP air
pet and FoT and you get this MASSIVE boost to DPS over the 60 mage.)
then stagnating while the more gear dependent classes start gearing
up.

The best solution I've seen yet is to have pets get a percentage of
your +HP/AC/Atk from your gear.

The difference between an Anguish Mage's pet and a non-raiding
mage's pet if remarkably small (in both DPS and mitigation) compared
to the difference between Anguish geared melee and non-raiding 
melee.

Which is exactly why, if I ever come back to EQ, it will be my BL I
play, not my mage.

:) 

In WoW I'm applying the lessons I learned in EQ -- don't get too
attached to one particular character/class.  I'm leveling up a Paladin,
Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, Druid and a Shaman.  This way I'll always be
able to change if I feel my current character got the shaft :)

Now, I just have to finish these dang mod coding projects I started
so I can get back to leveling :)  (they have so much promise to improve
my play, plus the whole mod programming thing is a game in itself)
