I built a Athlon 1900 over the weekend and I still don't have it running
100%, but I logged into Luclin a few times for some test runs and I'll say
it runs really close to BSOL(before shadows of luclin)...put it this way,
it's very playable now..  It was ok on my p3 667 outside the city but I
didn't like the FPS loss in the city....

I can give you an even better answer in a few days when I've had a little
more time on it...
