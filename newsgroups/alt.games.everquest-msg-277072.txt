As far as I can tell they occupy the same spaces, and I've heard that from
other players too, but whether it's a fact I can't say. I can say that there
are nodes without collectables (sea ones) and removing the sea ones makes
land ones form, and nodes without collectibles (some dungeons so far), and
that my experience seems to indicate correlation eg last night i had a zone
to myself, if i stopped harvesting (which i do when i see 'poachers' about)
then they seem to stop appearing, if i keep harvesting, they seem to appear
at a steady rate... but i expect only the devs know for sure.

I did a quick search but found nothing useful. It's pretty staggering how
many 'exploit' sites appear when you search on eq2 though.
