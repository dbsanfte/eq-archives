It depends on who posts them.  The Neocron post (what ever happened to that
game?), for example, was from someone who *claimed* to be a long time EQ
player, saying how much better Neocron was, or something like that.  This
long time EQ player had never posted to an EQ group before.  He also posted
similar messages in the DAoC group, and other MMORPG-specific groups.
Basically, an obvious shill for the company.

I consider that totally different from someone who has been a long time
poster here posting about another game.  MMORPGs all borrow from each other,
so it is interesting to learn about what is going on in the other games,
even for people who have no interest in playing them.
