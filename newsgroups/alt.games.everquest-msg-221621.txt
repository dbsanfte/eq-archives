Howdy All,

WHY?

I have  been in LDON groups where we used a Beast Lord in a few
missions to tank.  Then used a Ranger in a few others ... all wins! 
So why is it when I am putting groups together, the BST and RNG types
are usually unwilling to tank?  They can do it!

Hate that when there are no SK or PALs around ... 

On another note, why is it, SK and PALS make better tanks than
Warriors in LDON?!?
They seem, DO, hold aggro better than most tanks!  I prefere SK cause
they can snare pull and that keeps that mob looked onto them.  Very
nice to aviod "ping pong" mob aggro.

Oh well, you BST and RNG need to start stepping up to the plate and
tank when there are no other tank classes available!

Ted
