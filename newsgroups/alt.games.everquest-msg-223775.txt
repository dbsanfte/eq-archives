Not sure, my druid is only 60 so far (its my alt). Maybe you can quad
yardtrash in PON or POD? I think playing with frog pets in POS might be
better still at 60+. My druid still quads at 60... toilers im ME. I could
easily get better xp in a group, but sometimes I just like to solo.

Anyway at his level I wouldnt be be root/dotting for xp.
