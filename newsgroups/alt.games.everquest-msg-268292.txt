How is starting over in another MMORPG really any different than when a new
EQ expansion adds higher levels and content that is above your current
capabilities?  Well, there is one difference--a lot of people I've seen
who start over in another game have a lot more fun, because they got the
"must be uber" urge satisfied in the first one, and can stop and enjoy the
game the second time. :-)
