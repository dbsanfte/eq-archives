You are entirely right, of course. In fact, Parsifal will remain without
a surname, and I'm still undecided about Rhialto, if I ever decide to
take him to 20.

Hm... I've been in GD once, trying to do Tizmaks, but I couldn't bring
myself to kill them. They con indifferent to me, and if they got no
quarrel with me, I got no quarrel with them. I'll check out the Drakkel
Dire Wolves, though... In the very unlikely scenario of me ever reaching
the lofty heights of uberness, I'm a lot more excited about the idea of
befriending Dragons than giants. :)

I'll look into that too.

10pp? Did you cast Symbol on yourself and then just run the gauntlet?
Scary!

I'd definitely love to see the Wakening Lands. Do you know of a safe
place to bind there once I arrive?

Thanks!
