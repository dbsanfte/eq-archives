I'd say level 59 is probably the worst level in the game.  It's the level
that you have to get the most experience where a "typical" player is stuck
in tier 1 zones so 3-4 mobs solo give 1 percent exp.  At 60 i'd say its
easier to get flagged and move on to PoV/PoS and get better exp, therefore
the exp bar will move a little faster even though you have to get more...but
that's my view of things.
