I will definately look into the healing thing, if it can help a little, I
will use it. I just never saw it go up with out the pulse.

Chords, goes up with each level, as does Bellow, and if I were to switch in
the lute to up the healing increase, it would do more damage with it as
well. And since I had no enchanter, I was able to use it effectively.

As far as 4 songs is concerned, it's more a novelty than anything. 3 songs
at any level is pretty much par. And I did say almost 4, cant quite get that
4th song up before one drops.

Were you playing beta? Or was 3/99 the release date? Just curious. I started
playing around 8/99 myself on Rodcet, but moved to Xegony to play with some
RL friends.
