Ahah yeah exactly, specially since you transfer over complete with all
your lewt and high level char. From what they've said it will have no
more Rules than a regular blue server. You may see more enforcement of
existing rules only because there will be more of a gm presence.

From the gm events I've seen in eq, I really don't want to pay more to
see more of them. They seem to have a real screwed up view of who
interacts the most in an event and often they have loot selected ahead
of time meaning the level 50 people who raid neriak get jack while the
only dwarf paladin there get this uber item though he is level 7 and
really did not help at all.

Really I'm not ashamed to say that just as you say I'd likely be
paying 29 more bucks to be generally pissed off that I'm not getting
th attention or items I feel I am paying 29 bucks more for. That is
exactly why I think instead of more people they should have a server
where you pay more for NPC AI/Zone change events such as the mtn rathe
and other zones one during halloween (got some nice lewt from the mtn
rathe one) A server like that where zones changed fairly regularly,
costing 29 bucks more to pay for the people making the zone changes
would be of far more value to me. Various zones could go up and down
after an announcement every few days with cool npc/monster changes.
Since they do that in other zones they could even do it in a zone like
freeport.. imagine freeport taken over by undead.
