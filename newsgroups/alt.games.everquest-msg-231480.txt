Are you kidding? Ok, so I'm new (lvl 14), but on the server I'm on I
sell -ling silks faster than I can farm them at 10pp ea. I'm usually the
cheapest in bazaar. I could make a full-time job out of farming silk. I
generally do it in Feerot and even with the supposed 'nerf' I can get about
a stack an hour. If you ask me 200pp an hour aint bad money at my level.
Sometimes I even hire newbs to farm for me at 1pp ea. They love it!
