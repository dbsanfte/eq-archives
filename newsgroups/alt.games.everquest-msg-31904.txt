Coldain.  Best city in the world for traders, workable guild hall
for a lowbie cleric, access to the nearby hunting zone of EW,
where a party of newbies can take down a snow bunny... in
a level or two you can happily solo them.  Sure, eventually
you'll have to go off to the old world and work your way
from 7 to 25 or so, but then its home again and you are in
happy heaven, hunting tizmak, drakkkal wolves, kodiaks,
then frosties all right in your home hunting zone, EW nearby,
KD all of 2 steps away...
