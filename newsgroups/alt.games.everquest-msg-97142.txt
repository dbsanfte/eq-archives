Sorry... But asking for phone numbers, and not accepting credit cards...
Let alone, no serious background short of a paid domain name, nice CGI work
on a website...  If I didn't know better, it sounds like you are the perp of
this site.  The fact that no one can 'help' in this, no serious proposals,
money needs to be upfront...  Sorry, but even die hard addicts will have to
admit, while getting paid to play would be nice, he is asking people to put
their characters in the hands of a total stranger, giving a lot of
information, where he could make a killing inside the game with the items
you worked hard to get, the Game money you worked hard to sell on your own
and earned.

This isn't some friend you can hunt down and whap upside the head, or a
family member...  This is a guy asking for your money and the time invested
already in your character and saying, "This is nothing."

Scams work best when people are stupid enough to believe in the sincerity of
the scammer.
