Druid port-in for EJ is in the south-west corner... just head west and a
little north and you'll see the steep cliff in about 5 seconds, even if Clip
Plane is set pretty low... FoB zoneline is southwest of the top of the
cliff.

By the time you can use the port, you can solo kite anything you're likely
to blunder into, and there's enough room at the top of the cliff to circle
around a snared Raptor (so long as you don't pick up any adds) :o)
