OK, I bought the original game for $10.00 and am ready to take the plunge to
get started. I 've read through some newsgroups and forums ans glanced at
some guides.

What is the latestest patch I should apply after a basic install (being a Q3
and UT player I know that some patches can screw things up) ?

How do I pick a server that I will enjoy ?(since I've read that once you
start on one server you obviously can play on another but cannot take your
character with you ?)

Excuse my ignorance but I want to get off to a good start since I'm new to
the RPG games

Thanks!

Ross
