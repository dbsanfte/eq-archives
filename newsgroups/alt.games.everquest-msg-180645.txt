One of the regular posters to Graffes wizard forums (think he's an admin
now in fact, but too lazy to go look) dinged 59 and then did all of
level 59 to ding sixty in one marathon session starting on Friday
evening and finishing on Monday morning. (This was before the level
smoothing patch, by the way, when 59 was just fucking rediculous.)

Might not be the record, but it was pretty damned long.
