I don't really think ganking applies in this game to begin with.  Sure, in
UO (circa '98), you were just an innocent character wandering the roads
searching for monsters to fight to have a good time when a bunch of reds
descend upon you and mercilessly slaughter you.  This does not seem to be an
issue here as it will be a tedious task to cross into enemy realms,plus,
this is a game where it is designed to be Realm vs Realm.  If it is to
simulate real life, then ganking must occur because in real life... you do
have battles fought between different opponents where one side might have
5000 troops,the other 2000 troops, etc.  I see no reason why it SHOULD be
any different in a MMORPG.  And when a player knowingly buys an account for
this game, I am sure they would know the general concept of the game and not
be surprised if anything should happen.  I respect it not being your type of
game at all and I fully encourage you to play what you wish. But ganking in
DAoC does not appear to be much of an issue and definitely is in no way like
UO since you can't even PK in this world.  You are restricted to fighting
enemy realms.

You also seem to have a problem with these types thinking them to be young
and immature full of testosterone but quite the opposite is true.  From UO
experience, the majority of gankers, pk's, guilds of this type definitely
range in age between 20 and 40.  Possibly the most successful guild in UO
over the last few years, LOD (Baja Server) is made up of lawyers, doctors,
etc. and recently became involved in a similar dispute with OSI that
Conquest found themselves in.  Mass banning and disbanning of guild for a
variety issues.  However the guild has brains and ended up having to settle
with them because of various violations by OSI of their own TOS, heh.
