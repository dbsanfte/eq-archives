Nope. I understand completely that the dev team is different to a person 
from that of SWG. Hell, SWG is still in flippin' development if you ask 
me. I'm looking at the fact that both will have been created by SoE.

I hope you're right in that there will be no repeat of poor design 
philosophy or blatant and inexcusable rush to market. It's SoE that's 
been leaning more toward an interest in the almighty dollar than toward 
doing what's best for their games lately, not their game designers.
