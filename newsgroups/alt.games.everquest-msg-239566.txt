Typical price you can sell the 10 dose versions for is between 75-90pp.
Keep several on you though at all times.  You never know when you might find
yourself in some desolate zone and have someone shout they want to buy some.
Then it is up to you.  You could probably get more than 90pp for them in
such a case.
