How can an hour of downloads over DSL accumulate since the actual CD
pressings?    This seems a bit much don't you think?   Shouldn't most
of the files on the CD already bring EQ up to date with minimal
patching?

The download seems to finally be clicking along now at 12:30 AM in the
morning but it says it will take an hour.  I'm on DSL and you'd think
it was 2400 baud.
