 The statement  - Threat or not a threat?

 PlayerX says out of character, 'And I got your KID, Any time you wan tto
open your mouth and stick the barrol in it just feel free.'

  Is this a threat or a warning of self defense?   Or is it more of a, I
wish you would just die?

  The comment that spawned this OOC message was calling the PlayerX a KID -
just to clarify there was no hostages.
