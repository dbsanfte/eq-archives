As a necro I would tend to agree, though I have never honestly tried.  I think
some of the advice given earlier (root pet, snare caster, etc) is good, but
necros have such a large arsenal of dots that it is hard to cover all the bases.
Fire, Disease, Magic, Poison (nasty fast action dot and bad DD too).  If you
do happen to get close enough to hit him they can always shadow step away leaving
you swinging at air.  You have to keep in mind that necros are used to soloing
yellow/even cons for most of their lives- they live for 1 on 1 fighting.
