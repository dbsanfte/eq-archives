Don't quite follow the logic here. Yes, Gnolls, Kobolds, Minos, etc
are furry, but that doesn't make them THAT similar to Vah'shir. The
fur would be about where the similarities would end... I agree they
wouldn't do Lizardmen, though, because Iksar basically ARE advanced
lizardmen. A dragon race, however, would be HUGELY different from
anything they have. Of course, I could just see the cries about them
ripping off Horizons if they did that. >< If they "rip off" anything
from Horizons, I'd want it to be the crafting system.
