This sounds like something to do with your setup to me.

Suggestion 1. Ensure that your cache file is not allocated on your small 
30 drive. You *might* be running out of page space.

Suggestion 2. Remove the 256 meg strip. Perhaps you have a different 
wait state on that stick and are running into troubles when OS starts 
addressing space above 1 gig.

Suggestion 3. Next time your screen goes weird, type /loc. If it returns 
a 0,0,0 direction then its a server issue. Solution, is to type /quit 
and re login.

Suggestion 4. Make sure you dont have other software such as a virus 
scanner starting up and sucking more CPU time than you can afford once 
you are in game.

Suggestion 5. Do the usual and check for any conflicts in your setup.
