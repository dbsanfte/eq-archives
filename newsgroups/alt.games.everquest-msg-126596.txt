Opinion does not matter. What the Gm said to him was true; logs mean
jack and screenshots mean crap. The Gm has to witness it, or have a
log showing what happened. The problem is that to the server it will
look like that other guild attacked the mob and got the kill credit,
BECAUSE THEY DID.

That is kind of the way it goes. Now, if it was a case of what
happened to MY GUILD, where we got the kill and a guild like yours 
had the cleric loot the item when the timer was up (because our cleric
was not in the kill credit group, verant really needs to make the
whole guild get kill credit so can loot AND display an emote about who
loots in guild chat) In THAT case the Gm checked and saw we got the
kill credit and he gave the item to our cleric. We never heard what
happened to the other one, from the other guild.

First aggro does not matter on big mobs like that because, for
example, some 45 level bard could get lodizal after him while NO ONE 
he knew was around to kill it and claim that he had pulled it so no
one could touch it until his buddies showed up 3 hours later. 

Really the only option of fair play would have come from the other
guild. What they should have done, in the spirit of fair play, Is said

"okay, you guys got first aggro and were here first so we'll give you
this one attempt. if you crap out then we jump in."
