Well, was interesting, the other night in Field of Bone, this player
starts ooc'ing "I'm twinking a warrior, WTB decent gear", and I
jokingly answer, "Gasp!  A twink?!"  Then a third player, a monk, then
says, "Well, better than another twinked monk" and then the third
player (who was untwinked) starts talking about how it's harder for
him to find groups because of twinked players because people would
rather have the twinked monks to be pullers.
