The chances of someone with his apparent lack of communication skills being
moved to the SWG team are, I hope, between zero and none. Knowing Raph
Koster -very- well, I can say that he, at least, would never allow it. I
have also e-mailed him, just to be safe, about an employee wanting to
transfer from EQ to SWG spouting off about the company on a public
newsgroup. This, I hope, will prevent any such thing from happening.
