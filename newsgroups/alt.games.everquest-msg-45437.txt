Ok. I know that there are numerous bad things to camp/quest for in eq 
and sometimes it just devolves into evercamp, certain bits of class 
armor & various quests in various zones are just plain soul destroying.

what I would like to know about are peoples experience of Lord Grimrot 
in  the southern karanas?

Having placed my main by the undead camp I have spent numerous hours 
killing putrids for faction, ressurecting poor souls and gathering hides 
for tailoring, all good things and a valid pass time for my goals.  But 
grimrot remains elusive, he doesn't seem to like to appear at day or 
night.

Having seen Ph'ers come and go (in excess of 20 but now, sheesh but 
who's couting at this point) I constantly kid myself that "maybe this time"

I've spoken to others in game that have made the same decision as I and 
quested for the aegis, commonly the reply that I get is "ah the camp 
that almost made me quit the game"

So even my faith in Brell is being tested.

What are others experiences with this camp?

Are there even worse camps that I won't have to do, being a dwarf 
cleric, that I can take comfort in, share your misery? please.....
