Holy crap, there's a lot of good stuff in this patch!

My favorite:

> - Fixed it so that whenever a player loses the chance to click on a
> resurrection dialogue box (such as entering the inventory screen),
> the game will react as if the user had clicked "no". This should
> prevent cases where the player can not be resurrected unless they
> logged out 

This bug has annoyed me for so long! Glad to see it finally gone.

> - Changed safe spot in Kedge Keep to actually be a safe spot 

Gee, think you'll go over the rest of the 'Safe spots' and fix
them too? Getting sent right next to the sentries in Toxx if
you don't have a port stone is No Fun if those sentries have
moved a bit out to whack a kobold...

> - Translocate spells no longer require that the target be grouped
> with the caster. Also, the dialog box for this spell will remain
> longer 

> - Wizards now have an inherent chance to score a critical blast with
> their damage spells after 11th level. This ability does not lessen
> the chance of scoring a critical hit with Alternate Experience
> abilities that grant criticals 

The wizard in my regular group will be a happy camper tonight, I bet.

> - Added options in the Options screen (under Chat Filter) for filtering
> out Melee and Spell criticals. Options are All/Me/Off.

If you're grouping with a 54 warrior, and he suddenly insists that he
be allowed to go berserk, use this filter.

(From eqmanual_supplement.txt:)

> APPENDIX F - HITS MODE - Combat Text Display Options
>
> /hitsmode allows you to create separate windows for your combat text.
> This is a rather advanced feature, so it might take a little practice
> to get the results that you want.
> 
> Here is the technical jargon:
> 
> Usage: /hitsmode <my|me|other> <on|off|m2|m3|m4|m5> <X> <Y> <COUNT>
> <FONTSIZE> <HEADER> <BG> <WIDTH>

What's that, you say? I can actually read both party chat AND see my
own hits? Happy days!

Lots of other stuff too, mostly good.
