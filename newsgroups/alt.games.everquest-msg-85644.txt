I read this yesterday, and I wasn't sure whether to take it as:

1) Charisma affects charming in a minor for all
2) Charisma affects charming in a minor for Necros

Depends on if the answer was staying in the context of Necros or not.

For the other lazy people like me:

Question:
---------
Necromancers have really low charisma but get Fears and Charms which need 
it?  Doesn't this seem strange?

Answer:
-------
Charisma has nothing to do with resist rates on Fear spells, and has only a 
minor help on the Charms.  It's got a lot more to do with levels for both 
of those, so the Necromancers don't really have too many problems with 
that.
