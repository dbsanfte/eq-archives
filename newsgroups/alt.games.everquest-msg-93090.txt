Maybe right on the first count, presumptious troll bait on the second.

The main reason is to give the would-be hackers a hard time. It's much
harder to run hacks to cheat the game if you can't alt-tab out once
the connection is established. Most game hacks come from amateurs or
casual hackers who aren't willing to take the time to code one to work
without having to have the connection established first.
