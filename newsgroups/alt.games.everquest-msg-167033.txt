Whatever vendor I'm near, usually near a port location, although the one in the bank in PoK is
also handy, frequently we don't port out at all from PoP zones, just walk.  Peridot vendors are
also popular spots for dumping goods, since you can immediately convert the cash into peridots
which weigh less and are more useful.
