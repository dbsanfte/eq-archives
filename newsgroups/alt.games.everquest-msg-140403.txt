I know you said most.  We have a few where I work, as there seemed to be an
issue that caused CRT displays to wig out in some areas.  Personally, I'd be
worried about working in those cubes.  Evidently some EM interferance.  LCDs
work great in those situations.  My wife recently got one for home use, due
to the footprint.  She loves it, but does notice issues with the slow
response on some games.
