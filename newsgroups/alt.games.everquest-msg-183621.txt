A class is not the zones. A class is its skills and/or spells. You can
learn how to effectively use those with research. Mastering some of
the finer points take some practice, but not having the practice does
not mean you don't know anything about them. The knowledge can be
obtained through various means other than direct experience. It's the
actual application of the knowledge that requires experience.

I don't have to be a master pianist to know everything there is to
know about pianos...  I can know everything there is to know about
pianos, how they work, how to read sheet music, the principles of
music, etc, but still not be able to play Chopsticks. There's a
difference between having the knowledge and being adept at USING that
knowledge.

A level 20 can know as much as a competent and hardcore level 65
cleric because they have access to all the same information. Is that
to say that that level 20 can be just as good at USING the
information? No. But it does mean that the level 20 can have a full
understanding of the class and how it works.

Anyone who thinks otherwise is just being elitist and pig-headed.
