So don't go to the major areas...there's lots of others.  Obviously, as you
say below, if your friends only want to do things that you CANNOT do, due to
RL, that's a big problem.  BTW, ME is a big zone...I can't imagine the whole
zone being perma-camped.

No, I'm not.  I'm making the assumption that you enjoy playing EQ and would
like to continue enjoying your retired characters...if only you could.  My
enchanter was at level 56 for probably 6 months.  It's taken me 3 months to
get half way through level 57.  I imagine that I could have gotten through
57 within a couple weeks if I weren't a guild leader or had other things to
do.

Sorry, I still gotta accuse you of the underlying "ding" wall that you've
hit is a big reason why you keep doing new alts.  Level 51+ can be just as
much fun as levels 1-50.  Hell, Luclin was MADE for single-party groups.
The only REAL, FORCED difference between levels 1-50 and 51+ is the snails
pace of leveling.

If you can find groups with friends or whatever at level 36 you're going to
be able to group with the same type of people at 51...unless, of course,
those level 36s are all into uberraiding as well. ;)
