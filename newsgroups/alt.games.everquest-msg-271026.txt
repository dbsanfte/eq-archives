Hmm.  I haven't seen this problem on Linux, Win2K server or WinXP built-in
mirroring.  Haven't done much clever stuff, though.  Hardware RAID can be
somewhat more efficient (sometimes), but I haven't seen a lot of benefit in
flexibility.  I'll grant that they are generally easier for the first-time
user to set up than software arrays.

The problem with hardware raid is that you can't change controllers.  If you
get a new board with a different raid controller on it, you have to format and
start over.

Well, no.  It's an objective measurable fact.  It varies so much by use
though, that any prediction of how much effect it will have is opinion.

In general, for applications outside of scientific programming, disk access is
going to be a bottleneck more than CPU resources, so software raid will have
very little downside.

My gut (see "opinion", above) is that software raid will be indistinguishable
from hardware raid for this application, and both will be superior to
single-disk use.

Yup, most of the raid calculations are done in the driver rather than
hardware.  Some of them are "partial hardware", where the board offloads some
of the bit-twiddling, but the CPU still does some work.

Unless you know your application very well and have specific needs (or want to
run an OS other than Windows), I wouldn't worry too much about the distinction.

It's more likely an indication that drive performance isn't the main
bottleneck in whatever you're doing with these servers.
