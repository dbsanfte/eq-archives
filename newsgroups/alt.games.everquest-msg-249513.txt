Thanks for that link to a bit of egg on my face, btw. >_<

It does help provide a better perspective on things. I should know better 
than to get the majority of my news from television. :(

Though I still feel that rape, sodomy and other generally humiliating 
actions pale in comparison to a live beheading, I can see now where far 
worse acts of torture appear to have taken place in that prison, acts which 
would incite the kind of reaction to which Nick Berg fell victim.

I abhor all of these actions, but, inconsistencies in the reports 
notwithstanding, I must now admit that it does appear to have been much 
closer to a situation of an eye for an eye than I first believed.
