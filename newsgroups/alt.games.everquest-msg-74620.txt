Until we get uber equipment, that is...there's a thread on Graffe's
where a Wizard is reporting that in groups he's doing 6K damage/minute
sustained with no downtime.

He's using a robe from a Veeshan's Peak dragon that has a mana-free
cast of Rend, and another item I don't recognize that also has a free
DD spell, and has a horse and familiar to aid mana regen, and C2 from
the group Enchanter.

There's no need to put points in channeling or evocation, either.
They will go up fine on their own.
