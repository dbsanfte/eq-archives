Good, you speak for the healer, I'll speak for the puller (cause as the
puller I'm also aware of the mana of the rest of the group too).  Inc!

Actually, my chest has an odd grey tint to it that refuses to be changed by
dye.  :(

I have a "Mana?" hotkey, not used terribly often as I do have a firm grasp
on how much mana is being expended.  I honestly wonder about what type of
people you group with that they don't keep track of this without constantly
asking your permission to pull.

As I would hope any cleric who would lie when I do deign to ask their mana
would conclude.  :)
