The problem is that if they only revamped one or two zones at a time,
hardly anyone would get that excited about it, or hell even notice it.
What would be cool is if they revamped say, a dozen zones and waited
to release them all at once.  If all of the zones had changes due to a
single storyline (say, orcs have allied with giants and taken over
Faydwer) it could be made into a big deal, and people would notice
that their money is going somewhere good.

You could have a huge fortress built in Lesser Faydark, maybe an area
of Greater Faydark clearcut in order to get lumber for the fortress in
LF, uber strong Giants in Butcherblock or Dagnor's... the
possibilities are endless and very cool.  In fact, it's the kind of
content I had hoped would occur regularly when I signed up back in
March of '99.
