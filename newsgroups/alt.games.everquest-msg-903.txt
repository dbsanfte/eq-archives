Actually, the way I understand it is that now exp is divided by players
total experience, not by their level.  As an example, you have a troll
SK (1.4 exp modifer) and a halfing WAR (.9 exp modifier) grouped, both
of equal level.  The current system will give the troll roughly 61% and
the halfing 39% of the exp per kill.  They will gain levels at an equal
pace while grouped, as 39% of a kill will give the halfling the same
progress through their level as 69% of that same kill will progress the
troll due to the differing exp requirements.

With the new system, I believe they will split the exp 50/50 from the
kill (WAR & SK same levels) and remove all of the exp penalties across
the board, while keeping the bonuses.  This will result in the halfling
gaining levels slightly faster than the troll in this situation, but no
longer will the trolls (or insert any race/class with exp penalties) be
sucking the exp from their fellow group members.

I think the only number (aside from exp bonuses for WAR and ROG) that
will be taken into account will be level.  A group with levels 30, 35,
32 and 28 will split the xp as follows:

30th gets 24% per kill
35th gets 28% per kill
32nd gets 25.6 per kill
28th gets 22.4% per kill

This is regardless of class or race.  Once the exp is divided the
bonuses come into play and modify only that players share accordingly.

I think.
I could be wrong.
The numbers impress you though, don't they?
