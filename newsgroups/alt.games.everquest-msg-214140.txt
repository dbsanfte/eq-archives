I know people who will try to sell ice to eskimoes, uphill both ways.

I on the other hand, won't try to tell Richard that clerics are excellent
soloers, not afer reading the rest of his post where he details how to make the
best of a bad idea.

I spent half of each level from 35 to 61 soloing a cleric (without KEI most of
the time), it can be done, but I'll agree its a bad idea.
