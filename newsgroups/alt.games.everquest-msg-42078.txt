Uhm...what the hell are you talking about?  In the last year, I've
posted maybe twice saying that Verant tends to blame your ISP when it
is their problem, and didn't call them lying scumbags.  (Just checked
this with google to make sure I hadn't forgotten any).  (I also see
with Google that when someone was blaming Verant for frequent
disconnections that were clearly their ISPs fault, I told them so).
