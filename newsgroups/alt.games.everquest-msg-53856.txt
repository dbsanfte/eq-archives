Hehe, dont need askissing, but i have a few people on my dont sell
to/sow/port and so on list.
1 cleric dont matter that much, but some moron that spend 2 hours
bothering everyone in GFay, sending me a tell from a secondary char
claiming to be a GM that had recieved my petition (after people started
talking in OOC about petitioning him) got on my list.
Next day his 3rd char (Sindvariase and 2 other variants of the name with 1
letter different) wanted to buy some of my FierDal cultural boots, and it
was with great pleasure i could tell him that he would not be able to buy
my boots. And to my knowledge noone else on server can/do make them, so he
cant get them anywhere else.
