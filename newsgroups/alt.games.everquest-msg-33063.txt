    This is player convention. By the strict rules of the game, all areas
are like this with VERY few exceptions (like mobs spawned by handing in an
item).

>Is Kill Stealing allowed as well?

    No, never. Petiton the offender, and he'll lose the Ring at the least.
Depending on what GM you get, you may or may not get the Ring - usually, in
the case of a KS you will NOT get it as you failed to demonstrate you could
kill the mob on your own. But some GMs know who could and couldn't kill the
AC, and will award the ring accordingly.

    Understand that a "camp" is a social convention enforced by players, not
by the GMs. ALSO understand that the "first to engage has mob rights" rule
IS enforced by GMs, although if someone is using this to "hog" an area a GM
will impose sharing. For a rare mob like the AC, just hope that you get the
first blow in.
