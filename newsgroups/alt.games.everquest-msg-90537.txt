I know VI does like players to "discover" the game, hence giving little info
on quests, mobs, armor and such, but letting us "discover" for ourselves
that the severs are actually down (as opposed to the prob being with my comp
or ISP)and when they will be back up, is taking the role playing element too
far.
I assume this has to do with the Legends set-up, but VI have not said that
all servers will be coming down for it, (check scheduled downtime). And
before you tell that it doesn't matter anyway coz few people are on at 3-4
am pst, monday morning, I would point out that the UK server is down too.
Oh well, gonna go do some shopping, read a book, feed the cats, etc.etc
