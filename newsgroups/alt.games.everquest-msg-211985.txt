I mentioned Lavastorm... its a decent place, as I recall, for your teens if you
have anti summoned spells.  But watch out, some classes may find that their anti
summoned spells actually have a worse damage-to-mana ratio than their normal
nukes!  Resists are the key in these cases, there's a difference between
hypothetical damage output and actual damage output, if you are getting resisted
a lot you might find the anti summoned line (which has much better function
against resists for some reason) delivers more real damage despite a less
attractive looking ratio.

In my case, the anti summoned spell I just got seems to have a better ratio than
anything else in my arsenal, plus I've got those anti summoned DD proccing
weapons to supply my pet with, so I should have a significantly higher DPS
against summoned than against anything else.  We'll see.

Splendid
