I've grown bored with my character on EQ and am considering either starting
a new one or cancelling my account. The people I used to group with have
sort of fallen by the wayside and lost interest.

So I thought I'd throw up a post and see if anyone else'd want to set up a
party.  My plan would be to meet from 8-11 on Wednesday (EST) and basically
go see what trouble we can get into. Of course, we could still play the
characters on our own time as we saw fit...

Anyone interested?
