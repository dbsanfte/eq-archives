Thats true, but "connecting" might actually work if some of the load was
being shared by some ftp servers elsewhere, and moreover, the times I
actually get lucky and get past connecting (soon to hang again), it would
just be able to into the game at that point, since there was nothing to
download.

The patch files could also have been put up when the patch started (perhaps
earlier) so people could have been downloading them over the last 48 hours.
This is all easy stuff which would alleviate the patch server load by huge
amounts.
