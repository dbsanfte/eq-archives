Okay, I'm having trouble understanding this line of reasoning. First off, I
have very little plat to begin with and I don't know any of these traders
personally. When I'm in the Bazaar I buy the cheepest one of what I want,
even if it's only lower by one plat, that's one plat more in my pocket.

What do you do if there are 3 of the same item? One at 13000, one at 12999
and one at 12998. Obviously we have the first pricer, and two 1p
undercutters. If I follow your reasoning you buy the 13000 one. What if the
12999 one sold/went off trader before you started looking? Now there's a 2p
difference. What if the difference was 10p/50p/500p? Is there a point where
it's just a bargain and not an "undercut"?

Like I said, I just don't understand this line of reasoning because if I
followed it to it's logical conclusion you should be buying the higest
priced item.
