Your 6th level. Typical response for lowbies to make fast cash is to 
head to paineel or field of bone, and hunt bonechips  (or go elsewhere 
and hunt spiderling/spider silks) and sell em to players in the bazaar.

If you want a more stimulating adventure than hunting greens (time 
enough to do that when you 50th+...) then don't worry about cash, and 
just play the game and have fun, when you reach higher levels the cash 
flows a *lot* faster, even by your 20s.

Of course, if you simply want the most cash you can get at your level... 
go hunt decaying skeletons for bonechips...its not fun, or challenging, 
or remotely interesting... but it works. And at a pp per chip its pretty 
much the most profitable thing you can do until much higher levels.
