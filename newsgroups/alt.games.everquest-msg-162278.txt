Well preventing others from hailing the projection isn't bad/g IMO.

If your guild/friends didn't kill AD (the dragon) you have no right trying
to gimp your way into HoH.

Each time we've killed AD, we've had random people hide in our raid, or in a
corner somewhere, all from various guilds.

Each and every one that wasnt invited by us has been removed, either by my
guild wizards TL, gate, or via a GM if needs be.  (The other officers have
nicknamed me "The Enforcer" cuz i've been the one having to remove them heh)

Killing the projection works well too to stop othes leaching onto your kill.
