Playing a Shaman on EQ2 and wondering about how Spiritual Ward and such 
interface with the warriors ability to mitigate damage.  Is the damage that 
goes "against" the max of the ward calculated after it "hits" the warrior, 
taking into account his AC, defense, and other related skills?

Reason I ask is, if not, wouldn't a wizard tank as well warded, as a 
Guardian warded?

Anyway, just curious if anyone knows how this works exactly.
