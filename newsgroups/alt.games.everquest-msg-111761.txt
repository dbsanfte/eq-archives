  Whoever decided to password the LFG channel is a moron, it just ensures
that not enough people use it to make it any good to anyone.  The password
is usually LFG.  Type /join lfg:lfg.  If nobody else is in the channel,
leave the channel, then rejoin it with /join lfg.  That should put you back
in that channel and remove the password (until some other moron resets it.)

  I don't often see people selling languages.  More often, people teach each
other languages for their own benefit.  For example, the official language
of my guild is dark elven, and gladly teach any non-dark elves interested in
joining the guild that language.

  Your best bet is to just find someone else who is interested in learning a
language.  Teach them yours, and they can teach you theirs.  Or, you can
"bootstrap" each other... all you need is one point in a skill to teach
learn it and teach it to someone else, because you can teach someone up to 1
point in skill above your own level of skill.  Spam until you get a language
skill increase, then zone.  Repeat.

  Yes, but the best place to get bound would probably be the near the
entrance to the Warrens, or in Erudin.  As long as you're inside the zone
"Paineel", you can get bound anywhere.  The soulbinder is right next to a
guard that would kill you on sight (at least until you improve faction with
the heretics).  The entrance to the city is a lift that is activated using a
key over a rock that's near the lift.  You need good faction with the guards
to get a key, or you need to have someone give you the key.  The guards in
the 'newbie yard' dispense keys, as well as the ones at the bottom of the
lift... the key phrase is "I need a key."
