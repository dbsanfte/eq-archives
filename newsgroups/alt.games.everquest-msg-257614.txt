I'll add that, for a monk, the extra HP are a huge advantage
because the Mend skill becomes twice as effective.  (It heals
25% of max hp, once per six minutes.)

Despite which, I've never felt the need to ask for a Temp.
I sometimes end up with one, usually when a cleric throws it
in after a rez (often after turning down my attempt to pay
for the rez, too!), and once I managed to catch a MGB Temp.
I love having it, and I think I know how to change my play
when I've got it, but I definitely agree it's not necessary
and it's important to know how to play without it.
