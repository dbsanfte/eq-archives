But complete knowledge of everything would almost certainly include
knowledge of what could be and what might be, which is then determined
by free will. In other words, God would see not just what we have done
but what we might do if, for example, you decide to have apple juice
with breakfast as opposed to orange. It may not be a big change, but
God saw both possibilities and left it to you which you wanted or even
chose not to have any juice. Or God might see you driving and know as
you pass someone you don't like that you could go on or you could yell
at them or even swerve and hit them. And it's up to you on which
course you take. That's free will, and God sees all possibilities you
might take. That's omniscience.
