Last night, after many months of questing, I finished my rogue epic and
received my Ragebringer.   I can forget the thoughts of "I would sure hate
to have to do THAT again!" after I finished every little step.  Like some
epics in other classes, the rogue epic is "start over" if you fail many of
the steps.  What a relief!

Later, I managed to try out my new toy on some frost giants in GD.   My base
piercing went up from the low 40's to 70 and I broke my all time backstab of
284 with a new high of 360.  Can't wait to put it to more use as I had to
camp after only a half hour.

I have to thank my good friend Jakugg (JaZZmanian devil) and Tiru for
playing pawnshop owner and letting me get enough plat to multiquest the one
item (Kedge robe) I needed to do my final hand in.  I told the Guild in /gu
chat that I had found a seller for the robe but I needed more plat.   I
can't tell you how moved you can get until you start getting 15-20 tells
from friends offering their life savings to help you.   I managed to get the
plat from my 3 closest friends and luckily, should be able to cover those
with assets once I can sell them.

Anyway, I have been posting on and off of some of my epic exploits and I
thought some of you might like to know that I have finished.   /em Cheer.
