Generally common sense. If you find a place to stand where a mob's
pathing will never bring it to you when it's aggroed on you when
there's no logical reason for it not to be able to, it's obviously a
bug. (The POD by Kelethin is like this. I watched an enchanter sit in
a spot with his pet beating on the POD's back while it dashed back and
forth in an arc, never turning to attack the pet and never reaching
the chanter. No, the POD wasn't feared.) If a summoning mob is not
successfully summoning you when it should, you've found a bug.

If it's reasonably unclear, people tend to get off with a warning. My
understanding of the situation with CQ and the /gu transcripts
indicate they knew that the "tactics" they were using exploited bugs.
