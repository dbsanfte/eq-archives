not being able to verify the funds in your account would count as server
problem,especially giving sony's track record for not being very specific on
what happened,  if your bank doesnt allow instant access to funds that could
have been what caused it, also, I dont think the service works when they are
patching, and the login server did go down at least once that im aware of
without a patch in progress recently(about 2 weeks ago, it just up and
decided not to let anyone log in for about 5-10 mins)




It sounds to me like you have some pre-existing
dis-ease/distaste/whatever../ with everquest though if you let a minor
inconvenience like this one stop you from playing.
