Lokari took a short sabbatical. 

I haven't played EQ since before xmas, and expect to not play for at
least several more weeks yet. I was starting to burn out and that
would be a shame.

I left this group for a month for a number of reasons, mostly, well,
let's call them religious.

I took all the time I normally spend here (which is a considerable
amount, as any regular reader will know), and devoted it, and more, to
study, thought and preparation. A general tenant of Wicca is that one
spend a year and a day in study before formal dedication. Well, I've
spent almost 2.5 years, and am nearly ready to truly begin the journey
down that path.

Meanwhile though, I'm back.
