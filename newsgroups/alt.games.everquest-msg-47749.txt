You get no argument from me there... I find that the newer MMORPGs that try 
to minimize downtime and drudgery tend to burn themselves out really 
quickly. Would EQ be ruined if mana and health regenerated at a couple more 
points per tick? That I don't know... RPG design is a complicated matter, 
and I'm happy to defer to those who have been doing it for years. It can't 
be argued that EQ is terribly compulsive in spite of downtime, and arguably 
because of it. The longer the wait, the sweeter the final achievement.
