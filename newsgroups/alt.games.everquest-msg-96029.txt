Dang Jazz, your answers are almost always useful and correct but you missed
this
one buddy.

Once a monks mend is at 100 , it never fails. With the exception of a period
when it was bugged, but that is a different story. I think you were
confusing
mend with bind wound here. Also monks never get lock picking, jeez what
where
you smoking this morning? Been playing the troll warrior so long, it's
rubbing
off on you maybe?

Oh and bind wound of 201 does allow you to bind to 70 percent or a little
more,
combined with the 25 percent mend always gives you, a monk with bind wound
of
201 and mend of 100 can heal himself to 100 percent every six minutes. I
just
wish we could get a bind wound skill of 201 before lv 51. I soloed most of
my
40's and it would have been a great help then. Soloing for exp is nearly
impossible after hitting 51. I can solo some blue mobs still at 53 but the
exp
bar moves so slowly, I might as well spend my time beating my head on a
brick
wall, it would be more fun.

If you need to mail me , my isp is charter.
