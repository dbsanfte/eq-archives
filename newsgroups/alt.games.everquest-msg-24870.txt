Biggest nerf I have seen lately is the heavy drop in loot in Ill Omen.  Mobs
that used to drop gold and pp are now dropping copper.  I really don't
object seriously to most of the nerfs, but do wish they would document them
and be honest about it rather than slipping them in in these silent patches.
The nerfs that I do really object to are those lower the success rate on
trade skills as these create not only a money sink and keep players broke,
but also extend the time it takes to learn a skill.  This is unfair to
player newly beginning the skill, since those who started it earlier are
able to make money off the skill while those who start late may never make
enough money to pay for learning the skill, and quite likely will have no
need for the stuff they can make once they master a skill like smithing.
