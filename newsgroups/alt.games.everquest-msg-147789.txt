I got this from Castersrealm.

NEW SPELLS HINT AT POP CHANGES

A number of spells were on Test for a short while today hinting largely at
the raising of the Level Cap to 65 with the Planes of Power expansion.
There has been a lot of conjecture over whether the cap would be raised
since shortly before the Boston Fan Faire and even there no word was given
to confirm it either way.

However some leaks of info from the Test Server seem to indicate that the
Level cap may indeed be raised to Level 65.  Some theories are that this
raise will only be effective within the Planar worlds of the expansion i.e.
You would be Level 65 in the Plane of War but only Level 60 in Luclin or
Norrath.  We will all have to sit back and wait for further information to
emerge.

In the meantime here are some of the spells which were recently on the Test
Server (but removed after a very short period).  Note that these spells were
only on the Test Server, have since been removed, will most likely change or
may not go live at all and that some of the spell descriptions are at this
time only theoretical..

  a.. Shield of the Arcane 61 Mag/Nec/Enc/Wiz - Personal Shielding Spell
  b.. Force Shield 63 Wiz/Nec - HP Rune Shield + Mana Regen
  c.. Blood of Thule Nec 61 - Poison DoT
  d.. Legacy of Zek Nec 61 - Warrior Pet with New Model
  e.. Rune of Death Nec 62 - Pet Haste & Stat Buff
  f.. Saryn's Kiss Nec 62 - Magic Based DoT
  g.. Embracing Darkness Nec 63 - Magic Based DoT + Snare
  h.. Saryn's Companion Nec 63 - Rogue Pet with New Model
  i.. Death's Silence Nec 63 - 30 Second Undead Only Mez to Level 56
  j.. Seduction of Saryn Nec 49 - New Lich Spell
  k.. Touch of Death Nec 29 - Pet Heal Spell + Disease Cure
  l.. Child of Bertoxxulous Nec 65 - Shadow Knight Pet with New Model
  m.. Word of Terris Nec 65 - Undead Only Charm
  n.. Ward of Xegony Mag ? - New Air Pet
  o.. Servant of Marr Mag ? - New Water Pet
  p.. Child of Ro Mag ? - New Fire Pet
  q.. Rathe's Son Mag ? - New Earth Ppet
  r.. Firebolt of Tallon Mag ? - New Fire Based Bolt
  s.. Sun Storm Mag ? - New Fire Based Rain DoT
  t.. Black Steel Mag ? - New Magic Based DD

Thanks to the FoH website for gathering this information while it was
available.
