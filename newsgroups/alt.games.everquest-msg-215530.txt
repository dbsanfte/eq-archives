I've been having a couple of merchant bugs for the last few weeks.

Sometimes when I empty a merchant slot, a different slot will go blank.  So
I click on Done and right-click again on the merchant and the correct
inventory is shown.

And always now, if I empty one or more slots, none of the "hidden" inventory
shows up at the bottom of the "public" inventory, just the empty slots.

I haven't seen anyone else on AGE mention this so I'm guessing it's me.
Should I reinstall?

Clayton
