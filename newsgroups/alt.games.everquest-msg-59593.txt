I"ve met a lot of bards that don't use the faction song as a tool, I don't think

it occurs to most of them how handy it is.  You can pick out any intelligent
race, and be non-KOS with one faction.  Mem the song, sing it to one sample
member, and your reaction goes up with all members of that faction till you
leave the zone.  Don't have to keep the song running, in fact you don't need
to keep it memmed.  In a place like CC, where the -only- faction you are
likely to worry about is RyGorr, this is much handier than invis, which requires

a song slot and a twist slot to be active.  Outside in EW, the bard must choose
whether to be liked by RyGorr or Giants or Ulthorks... depends on what
you are hunting and where, but there's no reason not to eliminate at least one
of the three from your worries any time you are in the zone.

I did say include the group thing as a possible reason.  Exp bonus, I haven't
found to compensate for the "this is more difficult" penalty, but YMMV

It does seem quite high.  On the other hand, I see people advertising
to buy one all the time, it appears to be a very rare drop.  Talked to
someone who said he killed 50 in a row, no drop.  Since the guy in question
is a level 55 bard, 400pp isn't much money to him really... funny thing
is, since my main is a level 53 cleric, it isn't much money to me either.
I just like having sort of a quest to do... its a challenge now.  While killing
tundra kodiaks is relatively easy, there are a lot of ugly KOS wanderers
to contend with, so I'm having to develop my "eyes in the back of my
head" skills and my "get it off me" skills.

Regular Dire Wolves, or Drakkal Dire Wolves?  I thought you meant the
regular ones (Iceclad, EW) and as far as I know there's no faction hit... on
the other hand I haven't killed one as my druid yet, and its been many months
since my cleric hunted in those zones.  Druid, on the other hand, has done
some work killing Coldain Tracking Wolves, trying to get to non-KOS with
giants.

Yep, I had to stop with Tizmaks for the same reason, Cleric is always being
harrassed by the silly critters (I'm Red to you, idiot, get off me!) when
he gets port in, it will be handy as a druid not to have that particular
concern.

My cleric would have been a paladin if not for res.

I admit my druid is mostly intended to let me solo, as I get all the grouping
I can stand with my cleric.  But I'd still look for "outdoor" dungeons over
indoor ones where you can, SOW and Harmony are very nice tools to
have available.  In KC, for example (not that you are high enough level
to go there by any means) when a slot opens up for a snarer, I'd sooner
have a druid or ranger, while wizards, necromancers, and shadowknights
also snare, only the druid and ranger can keep us SOW'd for the
inevitable "hey did you just see someone run by... TRAIN" run to the
zone, and they can walk into the Warlord room and come back out
with just one dog at a time...

Kaesora/Mistmoore/Droga/Nurga

I've only been to the first two.  Kaesora is indoors, and gets tough
quickly as you journey further in, its also difficult to bypass sections,
as you'll see a layer of live, then dead, then live... means constantly
swapping invis for IVU and back, unless you are a rogue, and even
then I think there are some See Invis mobs preventing easy CR. There
is a one way dropoff going in, so unless you can make the circuit, a
porter is invaluable.

Mistmoore is also a mix of live and dead, but a bit better segregated,
and it has the advantage of being outdoors.  Also, a SOW'd tank
can almost always make it to zone on a bug-out.  Inside the castle
gets quite ugly, particularly you must never open any doors... that
job goes to the level 60 a raid brings along, because the enourmous
horde of stuff on the other side will be non-aggro green to him, and
he can cherry pick the targets.  It is, however, quite possible for
a group your level to pick any number of camps in the place and
hold them, if you aren't moving about much you probably won't
get in too much trouble.
