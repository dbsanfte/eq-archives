Even if it's not a copyright violation, it is a breach of contract,
which means they can terminate the services without being sued
(successfully, at least). In fact, if they could prove damages caused
by the actions that were in violation of the contract, they could sue
the offender.

A good lawyer might be able to find people who have quit playing over
"pharmers" and use them as an example of lost revenue...
