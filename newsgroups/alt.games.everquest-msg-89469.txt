I need some suggestions. I have 2 accounts and will be 2 boxing fairly often
and want some decent pairs.  This is what I have now:

Account 1:
HFL Druid (50)
IKS Monk (28)


Account 2:
HFL Cleric (41)
ERU Wizard (11)
??? Shamen perhaps? - Would perfer an evil-alligned one as I usually kill
anything that gives me exp with the monk =P

Now I have some other newbie characters created as well but I will delete
them as I need room.  I was thinking of a shammy next on account 2 for the
monk/shamen combo.  I also want a porter on each account to be able to get
around easier, and since the druid was my original I figured a wizzy would
be nice for the other ports as well.  I would like to create one of each
character as I like what they all offer.  What else would you suggest?

TIA, Danny
