This is not the case though for anything being green farmed now .

The fishbone earring can be gotten at level 15?
a shield in kedge (level 50+)
a fishing rod in sirens grotto (level 50+)
a ring off lodizal (level 50+)
few other items as well (level 50)
BUT from 15-50 you use the earring . (items at levels 25 35 and 45 are all
missing )

pyzjin drops the gbs (9 int ) at level 10
a drachnid thyxl of the dread widow works (level 50)
several diffrent books are equivalent (level 50)
the runed shield from city of mist (level 55)
the shield from the chardok queen (level 60)
But items are missing at (20 30 40) which means you use the gbs if available

The gap in the items is the real underlying problem not the people camping
green spawns . Luclin is supposed to revitalize the very oppressed finger
wigglers . This means that NEW equipment types will be comming out that have
no other equivalents . It means that there is less room to put missing items
. TCC is like looking at the real schmuck farmers and saying boy do we have
something for you . Equipment that alot of people are going to want
instantly and none are going to be able to get for themselves.

Low level characters dont use dungeons. This is because dungeons are
hideously dangerous compared to outdoor zones. Tcc as a shovel to get those
misbehaving low levels into dungeons isnt going to work . Tcc is not going
to be able to shovel out the manure( the farmers :p) . Tcc is going to cause
high level players who want an item out of a lower level place be UNABLE to
get it NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO.
