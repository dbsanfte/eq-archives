   I suppose if I asked them what their real gender was, and they lied
about, then I might care.  But to be honest, I really don't care what
gender the people I meet online are.  As far as I care, they all might as
well be disembodied brains floating in a tank.

   You know, I never really gave it that much thought.  I, playing my
character, liked to hang out and talk with them, playing their characters. 
You can certainly say that you wouldn't consider this sort of relationship
to be a friendship, but I did/do.
