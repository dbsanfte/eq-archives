    After this point, Ted talks about how fast you can get XP and top-flight
items. Sounds like you're trying to keep up with the Jones's, too - except
if you think you can do that with LDoN you're off your rocker.

    Hi. 70% AA in 45 minutes is better XP than 1 AA in 70 minutes. So
according to you, normal is better than hard for XP. That's so off it's
almost comical. Here's some real numbers. Normal mission: half an AA point
in 40 minutes, mission completed. Hard mission: a full AA point in 60
minutes, mission completed. Those are times with a smart, high quality group
that also has the DPS of a charmed mob. Compare with Plane of Earth: a full
AA point in 50 minutes, with or without Dire Charmed Miniature Dustrunners.
I won't even get into the nutty XP possible in a place like picnic tables in
PoFire. XP is better in PoP, period.

    You are correct. If we split the cash from selling the one top-end
tradeskill drop you'll get per hour in Earth, we'd get 500 to 1600 pp each.
That's on top of the diamond/blue diamond/raw diamond drops. The only thing
that makes the "split" low is, well, we don't split. So one person leaves
with the tradeskill item, similar to how LDoN item drops are handled by
groups.

    I'd tell you how my guild's soloists have done in Fire, and how many
60-100 K Incense Burners of Ro they've sold, but I think I'd make you cry.
And AA's? Don't even go there. I've personally gotten sick of all the "Ping
400-something!" and "Ping 500-something!" calls in guildchat, as I don't
play a solo class that can take advantage of it. (Some of the non-solo types
have used soloist alts to PL their main, but I consider that cheating and
won't do it.)

     http://www.silentredemption.org/lootrotation.cgi - put in "Plane of
Time", click on the fancy links, see if ANY of it is worse than what you
have.

    Except for the people that you have to group with since LDoN requires
4-6 person groups.

    Yep - augments that can be earned in single groups when the class
balance/numbers or available raid targets aren't there to raid. Put it this
way - if something is up to raid, and we have numbers/balance, you can bet
your ass we aren't going to be in LDoN instead.
