So I'm a  level 26 Druid in Wolf Form with  Wriath bone warhammer, smacking
for 30-35 a pop and I fancied making a bit of money off the raiders in South
Karana and happily dispatched a couple to meet their maker when the wod-elf
druid type riader pops. They can be marginally annoying if they root you but
no biggie.

I hit him, I hit him, I hit him and I notice that his health bar has gone
down to a not-at-all life-threatening 98% after about 100 points of
damage...

"Danger Will Robinson!"

I'm hitting him, I'm hitting him, I stick a Stinging Swarm and Creeping Crud
on him, he gets off the occaisonal foom and all of a sudden I'm at 70% and
he's still on 95%!

This little doggie turned her heels and ran for it!

I thought maybe he'd been uber-buffed by someone for a laugh but the next
one that popped had the same deal going. Turns out it's a known bug. Hope
they fix it in the next patch.

Motto: If it cons green and looks green it's probably green but *always*
have an escape route - just in case!
