Mobody, that time is gone, never to be seen again. You can't do
something then back-date an agreement saying that time has to be paid
for,

No legal mind has ever supported Yantis position or opposed his
position. The legal opinion most bandied about is that he is in
violation of IP law. IANAL, but any legal hack can see he is skirting
a contract with Sony. Prosecuting it is expensive, so it hasn't been
real visible.

Dosen't mean you got any either. At the least you have agreed to
terms, that are repeated frequently. They could come back and say you
clicked this agreement 243 times last year and you never agreed to the
terms? That makes any EULA-didn't-stick arguement weak.
