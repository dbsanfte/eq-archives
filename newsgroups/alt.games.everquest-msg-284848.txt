Read a rumor:

The changes to the resist mechanics, while focusing on level 70 
characters with substantially stronger gear, have resulted in 
dramatically increased difficulty in many encounters on the Progression 
servers. For years, encounters had their difficulty tuned around the 
Defensive discipline and the Slow line of spells. Now, due to the 
changes in the resist system, it has become virtually impossible to slow 
ANY NPC which has been flagged as a raid target by the /con system. 
These encounters, already built around the fact that their attack speed 
could be altered, have now had their difficulty catapulted by a drastic 
degree, frequently requiring 3x the healing as before.

This byproduct, while rendering "old" content slightly less trivial for 
characters at the current level cap with gear made available by later 
expansions, has created a difficulty for casters as a large swath of 
spells are rendered ineffective. Resist rates have rocketed through the 
roof, strongly diminishing the reliability of detrimental spells.
