Double quotes "  indicate a quotation.   Single quotes ' indicate
paraphrasing.

And delay the beginning of the next fight because of it.   It would be the
same if a warrior said "I'll go pull in a few minutes.  I have to make some
banded armor real fast."  After all, both don't count, as they are not in the
middle of a fight, by your way of thinking.   (Hint, that was not a direct
quote either)
