Sure, but don't expect much propigation of whatever you post.  Even if it's on
your server and mine, I won't see your messages nor you mine unless the
servers between us also have the group.  

It's been added to my feed, because my upstream news provider basically adds
anything that comes across - it's cheaper in terms of customer complaints
to add a bogus group than to miss a valid one or spend any employee time
tracking down the difference.  However, I have seen zero messages, not even
spam.

One thing people CAN do, if they want the group to actually succeed: if your
ISP/usenet provider does not have alt.games.everquest2 and you want it, ask
them to add it.  If "enough" servers carry it, it'll start working.
