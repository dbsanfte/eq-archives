Yes, in fact i think it is designed with that in mind. From a player
standpoint it is certainly the BEST way to do it. You can get most of
the epic done before level 45 probably, leaving parts like getting the
Venril sathir remains in kurns, the frog guy in swamp of no hope and 
the spawned fayd in timorous until you are in an okay sized guild.

No, but I've heard conflicting reports that you need to be level 45
plus to actually GET the finished epic (maybe 49)

Sure. Really the epic is designed, verant has said this, so that you
will do the early parts of it at level appropriate times. 

For example, killing the aqua gobs in Lake Rathe solo to try to get
the tainted to spawn (who may or may not spawn a corrupted) is a real
pain in the ass in your mid 50's. You gain virtually nothing from it
and its boring as hell. Meanwhile, if you and 5 other people go there
at like level 35 or so and have someone pull gobbies up top you can
get a druid and cleric the drops at the same time while getting some
level appropriate XP.

The barracuda in lake of ill omen is kind of the same. If you instead
bring a group at a bit lower time you can pull the spawning PH cudas,
some other ones, and some underwater gobs. It may not be any faster
but its much less of a headache.

The forages you have to do can be done at any time also, as far as I
know and its never too early to raise some of the factions you might
need.
