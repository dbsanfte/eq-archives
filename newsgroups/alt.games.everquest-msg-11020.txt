Can't recall if it's been touched upon already or not, but...

This is one of the typical situations within Wicca, as well. A child
may be *introduced* to the Goddess at a ceremony not unlike a baptism,
but no one is ever dedicated to the faith except through their own
intent.

This doesn't mean that the children of Wiccan's are barred from the
rituals or holy days, of course - it just means that they are free at
all times to make their own choices in the matter.
