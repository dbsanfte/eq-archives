   Hmmmm ..... I had originally thought that if this was a new quest, I
might talk some people into donating to my character in game for the
info on where this NPC is/was. (That could have been extortion, bribing,
paying off a snitch, buying info, hiring a guide to lead your character,
or what ever role-playing you wanted to do.)  
   But I've decided that it would be easier on me, easier on everyone
else, and a lot nicer thing to do if I just gave out the info I have. 
(You guys/gals have helped me in the past so now maybe I can help some
of you.)

Some of what I want know is is this part of the Tome of Ages quest or
maybe part of the Staff of the Wheel quest?
   So here is part of my log containing the info I have on the NPC, the
quest(s), etc.

Note: The log has been reordered a little (See time stamps) to make it
easier to read and find related info and one piece of info added to the
log is in parenthesis () and in all CAPS.)
