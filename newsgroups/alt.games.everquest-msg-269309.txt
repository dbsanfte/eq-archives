I chose tailor, but mainly because I'm playing all 4 character slots on the 
same server, and 3 of the 4 are restricted to light armor by their class. 
Therefore tailor will be of more benefit across all characters.

That said, my brawler (soon to be monk) is my main character, so I am making 
one of my alts an alchemist anyway.  :)

The drawback to my plan, however, is that my adventuring level is outpacing 
my crafting level.  Since I'm working all characters up in crafting levels, 
they go slowly.  But I'm really only concentrating on  a single character as 
an adventurer for the most part.  So at this point I can't craft the armor 
that really is of any benefit to me.  lol.  oops.  Flawed strategy on my 
part, it would seem.
