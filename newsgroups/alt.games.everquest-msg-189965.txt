If you get hit while you have a Damage Shield up, you have a chance of
having your Offense will go up.  Mob's taking damage from you, after all.
Several times during my leveling, I'd get hit while I had a DS up, and I'd
get an Offense skill-up.

Heavily power-leveled characters are almost always DS'd the entire time.  So
it surprises me not at all that the PL'd froggy has an Offense of 177 and a
IHB of 5.
