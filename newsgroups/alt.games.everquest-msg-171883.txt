 From recent personal experience, I can assert that all of the first four
Druid DoTs stack together:  Immolate, Creeping Crud, Stinging Swarm, and
Flame Lick.  Prior to the DoT stacking changes Immolate and Flame Lick
were incompatible, being from the same line, and likewise Creeping Crud
was incompatible with Stinging Swarm for the same reason, but this is
no longer true.
