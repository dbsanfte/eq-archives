Yes, highest sustained DPS class given a constant flow of mobs and someone to make them turn
their backs politely.

Wizards may have higher burst DPS, which is nice when killing big mobs, but don't fit the
constant flow smaller mob strategy that tends to net a higher exp per hour rate without
irritating deaths.

An AOE group can certainly out exp any group in the game over a good range of levels, but I
don't think of it in the same terms as a min/max group; you wouldn't think of
warrior/cleric/enchanter as the core of such a group, although these are good classes to
include in one.

AOE group

Cleric
Enchanter
Enchanter
Wizard
Wizard
Wizard

Or even

Cleric
Enchanter
Wizard
Wizard
Wizard
Wizard

if you are quite confident in your enchanter.  The chanter does nothing but spam AOE stuns,
the cleric does nothing but heal as needed (group heal helps sometimes, fast heals very
helpful)  One wizard pulls, another moves mobs into position and the other two wait.  When
sufficient mobs are pulled in really really tight, all four wizards spam AOE nukes, and once
things are well under control the cleric dumps his mana into AOE nukes too.

Killing 30 or 60 mobs on a full bar of mana, then medding back up to full, this group has a
very good chance of killing more mobs per hour than any traditional "pull it, beat on it till
it dies, repeat" plan.

I wouldn't give it much chance of working out in POP zones though, where mobs hit for enough
damage to kill your chanter dead and stun resists and "only high level stuns will work" mobs
are far more common.  I've not been asked to an AOE group since POP release
