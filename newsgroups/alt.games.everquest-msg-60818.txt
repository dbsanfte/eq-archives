Jeff's advice is Sooooo important!

Divine Aura and Divine Barrier should be up at all times.
I know you asked how to reduce agro and received many suggestions, but
still there are times when heals are needed immediately before enough
agro is accumulated on the tank(s).  Aura will make a huge difference.
 Take for instance an overpull in Hate.  You can tell which clerics do
not use aura right away because they are dead.  Thats ~18 seconds of
safe medding while tanks build up agro and possibly taunt other adds
or at least build up damage agro.  Use aura and live on the big raids
where there are 3-5 mobs and 40 ppl... enough time for others to get
agro.  A seasoned cleric will swear by DA and DB.
It really is a "reverse taunt[agro]" as Jeff puts it.

Good Luck and save lives ;)
