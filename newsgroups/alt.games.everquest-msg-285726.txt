Blizzard had enormous resources where development was concerned. Add to 
that a graphical direction that, while incredible in its own right, 
provided a much lower hurdle for the dev team to clear. Less time spent 
making the graphics engine work = more time spent on gameplay mechanics.

Sigil came right out and stated that the game was not finished, but they 
had no choice but to release it in its current state. The money had just 
run out. SoE, in their infinite wisdom, had effectively cut them off.

If you can't accept it as is now, come back later, I guess. It will get 
better. In the meantime, there are a great many of us who are more than 
happy to pay to play it in its current state.
