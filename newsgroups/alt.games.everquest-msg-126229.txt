Quest for fun sucks in gamers across the globe

Thousands can play at once

By Marc Saltzman, Special to USA TODAY 
 
 
Bridget Agabra Goldstein is like many hard-working women. By day, the
Pasadena, Calif., mother of two runs three bagel bakeries and an
online bagel store. By night, she puts the kids to bed and unwinds by
socializing with friends and playing games. But her friends are in
different countries, and the games are not mah-jongg or hearts.
Instead, Goldstein, 40, logs onto the Net to roam through dangerous
dungeons to slay dragons--along with tens of thousands of other
players at the same time somewhere else in the world--in a
role-playing game, EverQuest (www.everquest.com). She plays about 10
hours a week. "It's fun. It's social, and it's like stepping into a
well-written adventure novel," says Goldstein, whose game name is
"Nin."
  
"She can be part of a team calculating how to bring down a (scary
creature) or she can click her magic boots and fly over Everest-scale
mountains," says Goldstein. "Or I can just sit by a virtual lakeside
and console someone who has had a real-life setback."

Concerns raised

More than 430,000 gamers pay $12.95 a month to play EverQuest. They
roam electronic landscapes, chat with other players, and solve quests,
whether it be to slay an army of enemy creatures, escort a member of
royalty to safety or recover a stolen artifact.

No matter how much one plays per month, the price is fixed. This
"persistent" online game--meaning all events continue even after
individual players log off--has proved addictive for many, earning its
nickname "EverCrack." In fact, EverQuest addiction has raised renewed
concerns in the media. Twenty-one-year-old Shawn Woolley recently shot
himself in an apparent suicide after reportedly playing the game for
up to 12 hours a day. His mother blames his "obsession" solely on game
makers, though she admits her son had psychological problems before.

But--in moderation--online games have their good side, too. Goldstein
still plays after 2 1/2 years because of the friendships she's formed.
"I have met almost all of them in real life, and we just have such a
blast when we play," Goldstein says.

EverQuest is by far the most popular game of its kind in North
America. There are other "massively multiplayer" role-playing games
capable of supporting thousands of simultaneous players, such as EA's
Ultima Online, Microsoft's Asheron's Call and NCsoft's Lineage: The
Blood Pledge. Others were previewed during the recent Electronic
Entertainment Expo, including Electronic Arts' The Sims Online and
LucasArts' Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided. Today, online gaming
is a $200 million industry. Michael Garternberg, analyst at Jupiter
Media Metrix, estimates it will climb to $2.5 billion in the next five
years.

In 1999, 18% of all PC game players, who purchased CD-ROM games at
retail, also played online, says the Interactive Digital Software
Association. This year, the number was 31%.

Casual OK, too

But time-consuming games like EverQuest aren't for everyone. A mission
can take a few hours or a few days. Nor do all online players enjoy
the more violent online "3-D shooters," such as Counter-Strike or
Unreal Tournament.

But millions of more casual PC gamers have ditched the old standbys of
Windows Solitaire and Minesweeper for online puzzle or card game
diversions. These typically use Flash, Shockwave or Java technology
and do not require any files to be downloaded to the user's hard
drive--a convenient advantage for the time-pressed.

"I'm not technically savvy, and I don't have the time or interest to
read a 200-page manual, so I prefer the five-to-10 minute online
games," says Jonathan Simons, a financial adviser from New York City.
"Typically I'll play a puzzle game by myself on my lunch hour, or
before I go to sleep I'll launch a multiplayer game." He likes Euchre
on Yahoo's site (games.yahoo.com) or Spades over the Zone on
(www.zone.com). Both of the sites offer player matchmaking, so gamers
can find others.

In fact, 18 of the top 20 games played at Microsoft's MSN Gaming
Zone--a site with about 30 million users--are "casual" games, such as
trivia game Outsmart or old favorites, including Hearts.

There are more than 150 games available on the MSN Gaming Zone, most
of which are free. Some of the multiplayer games require a
store-bought CD-ROM, which stores most of the data needed to play the
game.

Another popular destination for solo and multiplayer games is
RealArcade (www.realarcade.com). Once the free RealArcade software is
downloaded, players can either log online and play one of 140 Web
games or download titles to play from a hard drive. The games are free
to download but will be limited in some way (only 10 free plays) until
a credit card is used to unlock the full version. Depending on the
game's depth, they cost either $9.99, $14.99 or $19.99 each.

Real Networks spokeswoman Molly McCarthy says much of RealArcade's
success is because it makes game playing easier. "Our software will
first detect if the player's PC can run the program, and then the game
is automatically installed. ... It does everything for you" McCarthy
says.
