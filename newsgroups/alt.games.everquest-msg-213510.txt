as best as i understand that expcalc . . .

it lists the time required to gain exp, in terms of gaining AAxp, per level,
for the zones of norrath

it ASSUMES that you are killing at a constant rate, taking into account
things like downtime, afk time, etc....and that you are adjusting your kills
per hour to that

it ASSUMES that the mobs are blue to you....according to it, a lvl 65 could
get an AA in about an hour in almost any zone, which isn't true, since
things will be green in 80% of the zones in eq to a lvl 65

long story short, it doesn't do the work for you....it just lists the ZEM
for most zones and requires you to do all the think-work
