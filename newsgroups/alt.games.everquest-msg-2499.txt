Well I know i am kinda overreacting but like I said it's the princable. If he
had KS'ed me again I would've reported him.  kill stealing is kill stealing if
it were like a dragon or a rat.  Or as another case a while back I watched a
lucan raid.  a guild had planned it for months and tooks days to get all the
right people to freeport.  they waste lucan and then a really low level paladin
who somehow got into a group looted the lucan skeleton after for like half an
hour everyone said "do not loot this it is for so and so"  he took the
testament and when everyone went ape caca his response was "I needed it"  well
an hour later two gm's show up and the rightful owner of the testament got it. 
But I guess what I am saying is just because you pay your ten dolaars a month
and you happen to have a (sometimes semi high level) character doesn't give you
the right to act like you own the game...hopefully there are not too many
people out there like this and hopefully they think they can solo Lord Nagafen.
 I'll be there to root them on when they try.  :)
