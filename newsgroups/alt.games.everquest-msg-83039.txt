A guild-mate e-mailed and asked how to get into the Crystal Caverns.  He 
said he heard that "the entry is via a teleporter inside Ry'Gorr keep in 
Eastern wastes. The TP entry should be a 'snow ball'".

Is this correct?  If not, can you please provide better info on getting 
there?  If it is correct, can you please elaborate on it?  Maybe something 
along the lines of:

"Run into the Keep with SoW and Camo, keeping to the right wall.  Go 
through the second door on the right and jump on the Snowball in the middle 
of the room."

Any help is appreciated, even if it's just "Run in the front of the fort 
and jump through the teleporter that is right in front of you."
