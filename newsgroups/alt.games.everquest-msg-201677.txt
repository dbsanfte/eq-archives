Here is the charisma suit of my halfling druid. I show bargain Zebu bazaar
prices when I know them. They vary a lot by server.

Electrum Star Ruby Ring
Squad Ring --  lore no drop from halfling guards in Misty
Golden Cat Eye bracelet (2) -- 25pp each
Silver Cat Eye Necklace -- 5pp
Opalline Earring (2) -- 25pp each
Opal Encrusted Stein (2) --  20pp each
Small Resisting Deity -- (range slot) I made mine
Acolyte's Anklet -- low level quest, small races only
Leatherfoot Raider Skullcap -- low level quest, halflings only

There are cheap items that my pc cannot use, a npc-sold tuxedo for example.
It might fit you.

There are a few charisma level cutoffs. i don't remember them exactly, but
it's explained somewhere on EqTraders. Below a certain level (50?), you will
get worse prices always. Above a certain level (170?), you will get best
prices always (if the npc is willing to sell to you at all). There is an
easier threshold (120?) where you get best prices when the npc is at least
indifferent and not greedy. Npcs gets greedy when their inventory is full.
