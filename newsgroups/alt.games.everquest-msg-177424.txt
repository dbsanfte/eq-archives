Dunno, I've got to disagree with that.  A soloer has more limited options of
where to hunt than a group does.  We've got to find places where we can
either single pull, or have a way to deal with adds.  We're also a bit less
tolerant for wandering mobs and such.  I'd say our limits justify our
sticking to the places we've found we can solo.

It gets a bit irritating to be sitting at the Dreadland spires, pulling dark
blue skeletons and have a group in their thirties demand that you give them
the spot because there's only one of you, and four of them.  Bah!  Go hunt
the places I can't.
