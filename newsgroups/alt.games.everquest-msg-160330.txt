The problem with the Silken Whip is it is very slow by high level
warrior standards (28 delay) and IIRC it is primary only which
hurts even more.  So if it doesn't proc early and often you're
giving up significant DPS and significant hate, not good for agro
holding purposes.  AFAIK it's mostly used as a soloing tool.
