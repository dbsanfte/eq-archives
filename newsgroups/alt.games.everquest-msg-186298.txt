There's a new Frog NPC (Gubbly Gippledo) in Freeport that is involved
in a Paladin ring quest, I killed the mob near the undead tower in
South Ro unwittingly which I'm told drops a piece involved in it.

Zeek is a Dwarf NPC in Befallen who conned dark blue to me at 65 and
mentions something about potions - the reward is some rubbish Shaman
newbie item.
