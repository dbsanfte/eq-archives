Actually the complainers here may have a valid case. The government
in the US requires compnaies to honor things (like win 95) if they
infact advertise that it is supported (like when it says win 95
supported on the box).  Also a month of EQ you get with original has
to be supported.  This can't be done for the person that bought it a
week ago. My last point is when stereo came out the government
required that audio systems still support mono.  It is backwards
compatability and had to be done for so many years (laws have
changed here so this may not be valid any more).  I am not sure how
this will turn out, I do know that class action suits make money for
a very few (lawyers) and the rest involved get some lame ass
settlement.  I also know that Sony makes a HUGE amount of money from
this game every month.  I am not sure how much of it is profit, but
I am sure it is enough that they just don't care about a small win
95 pay-off if it ever even happens
