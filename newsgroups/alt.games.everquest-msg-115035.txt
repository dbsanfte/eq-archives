Granted this probably doesn't apply to an Erudite necro, due to
faction problems, but for making medium-size fine steel plate Qeynos
works just fine. The smith shop next to the bard guild has molds, MQ
ore, and water (upstairs), and a forge right outside the door. Ornate
chain and small/medium fine plate are still easier to make in the
Bazaar, though, since the chainmail patterns are in North Qeynos and
HQ ore is in South Qeynos, and small/medium plate molds aren't sold at
all.
