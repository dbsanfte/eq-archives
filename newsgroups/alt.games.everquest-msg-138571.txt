Many of us have seen in excess of 4 summoned pets
swinging away at a single target - but have seen 
a charmed pet just wander away from the same mess.

So, like many things, it appears that the 4 pet
limit is for charmed pets (and NPC's) not summoned
pets which were made more PC like quite a while back.
