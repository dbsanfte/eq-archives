They are portals to the plane of Knowledge. If you have the Planes of
Power expansion you can click on the book and be teleported to the
Plane of Knowledge. From there you can teleport all over the world of
Norrath.

I do it by editing the EQCLIENT.INI file in the main EQ directory.
There may be a way of doing it in-game with the user interface or
through a /command, but I have never bothered to learn if there is.

I have always closed them individually. If there is a way to close
them all I have never used it :-).

I think the skill has to be well over 100 and possibly even maxed at
200 to stop the "swaying" completely. As the skill increases the
compass should move in smaller sweeps.
