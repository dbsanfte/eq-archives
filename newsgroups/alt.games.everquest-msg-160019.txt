I was running through oasis when i noticed cazel, who was conning white. I
was busy and just ran past me, but he took offense, and the first time in my
life i was summoned and beat upon. He kept breaking root, and i only just
made it to zone. Despite full mana expenditure all my dots and blasts did
not move his hp bar at all.

I presume he is underconning like mad, or are all lv 51 mobs this nasty?

How do you fight a mob that can summon when you are a druid? Just gate and
come back with a party? I am really not looking forward to being forced to
join a group. I like soloing or duoing.
