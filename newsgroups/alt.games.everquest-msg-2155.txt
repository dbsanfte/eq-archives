If you want dungeons that are actually populated you're pretty much stuck
with those two at level 39...and being an enchanter you should have an
easier time than any other class (but, of course, no guarantee of a group).

You're too low for Karnors.  Nurga/Droga (I always get them confused) is a
BYOG (bring your own group) dungeon though I like both zones.  Kaesora is
another good one which may be easier to find a group now that melee can bind
outside.  Paw should be an option as well, but MAY be BYOG...and again, it
may be more crowded now (a good thing) since folks can bind in NK.

I can't think of any other 39/40 appropriate dungeons in the old world,
Kunark or Velious.  Lots of places to hunt, just can't think of dungeons.
