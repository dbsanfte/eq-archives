While the third movie was indeed the best, I really didn't think
the second held a candle to the first...

On the other hand ONLY the second Alien movie was really
worthwhile, although the original was amusing in a Dark Star
sort of a way.

Hmm, what else is like this.  Ah, Road Warrior.  Mad Max
was an interesting little indy flick, Beyond Thunderdome
was a horrific Disneyfication, but Road Warrior was an
absolute blast of a film.
