I have soloed with my shaman at every level up to 48 so far.  The tactics
change over time, but the ability is there to do it easily.  25 to 34 I
found that SK and OT were excellent places to solo, LoIO works too, but I
hate that zone.  I also grouped a lot during most of my levels, I have
probably soloed 20 to 30 percent of my time overall, scattered throughout
all my levels.
