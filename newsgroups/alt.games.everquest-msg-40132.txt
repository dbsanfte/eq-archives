Last year, during a memorial service for a guide on EMarr, people were
shouting for twinkage. One newbie in particular ran around forever
asking what was up, was told, asked people to help him, apparently
couldn't take the lack of attention and proceeded to attack the PoD
half a dozen times.
Numerous petitions against him followed the service.
