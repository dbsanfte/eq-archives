for some reason it doesn't remember diablo II for me either,turn it
off,start the game up and connect to what you want,then turn it back on.As
proof that zonealarm works,some buttpirate will put hidden .eml (email)
files on my computer that have viruses,of course Norton Anti-Virus kicks in
and prevents access to then,but clicking ok (literally thousands of times
once) about it telling me that it has restricted access to those files gets
old fast.Plus if he can't  put files on my computer what else can he do?If i
forget to restart zonealarm it will happen again.
