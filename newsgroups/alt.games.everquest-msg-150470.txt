They were made perma rooted (in most cases) to prevent content being skipped
/ make the mobs a challenge again.
Unfortunately that means you can also gimp them and have it fully debuffed,
slowed, crippled, weakened,  even have MA agro built up before you even
engage.

Well other than the fact root would never stick on these mobs? :)

Some mobs are slowable.. thats fine.  They arent meant to be slow before it
can even hit anybody though... else just make it 60% slower and then mark it
unslowable.

Debuffs can be difficult to land too, by gimping the mob and debuffing
before engaging, you can spend 10 mins re-casting slow/malosini/cripple
knowing the mob can't hit you, and thenby the time you do engage him, hes
gimped so its a much more trivial fight.

Im refering to mobs like nToV lords and ladies, ST named, TiV/THO, tunare,
Greig, Ssra named (xtc, hp, al, rhags), yeli.

Being able to stand 10 feet away from a dragon and cast detrimental buffs as
many times as you want, with no risk of harm to yourself guaranteed?  thats
bullshit.  You can even camp/coh when its slowed so you lose agro.

Summons should be counted in terms of hate, not damage taken.  Casting tash
and malo should make any summonable mob in the game start to summon their
gimp asses
