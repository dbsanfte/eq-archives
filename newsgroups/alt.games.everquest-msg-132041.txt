There are some brand new Newbie Armor quests which they put into the
game recently in many zones. Take a look at allakhazam's pages for the
newbie zone nearest to you for recent updates. I haven't personally
gotten any of that armor, (not playing any new alts currently) but I
understand it's a lot better than the old stuff you could loot/make
yourself from pre-level 20 mob drops.

The Freeport area has quite a few, I understand. Not sure about the elf
cities.
