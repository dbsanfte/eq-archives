I'll start by saying I have no idea what you are reacting to - my post
or the topic in general.

I don't know why it became bad form to "sell" buffs/ports, but it
seems it is frowned upon when people advertise "Porting to all rings -
20pp". I personally don't see anything wrong with it. /shrug

That said, the person being ported not ponying up an "acceptable"
amount is wrong. You may not know *exactly* how much the porter had in
mind, but you can be certain that if it is anything, it is more than a
couple of plat. Most people are well aware that a port will cost you
between 15pp and 30pp to most destinations. If you get ported and pay
2pp, then you are ripping someone off, I don't care how it was
phrased. If, on the other hand, you are a newbie and didn't realize it
costs that much, of course that would be understandable.

You know what common courtesy/going rate dictates. To pay less is
dishonest. You're knowingly taking advantage of someone.
