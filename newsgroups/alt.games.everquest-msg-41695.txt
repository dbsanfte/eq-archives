It's certainly a rational thing to assume, given that DAoC comes out
in a month. It's not like peak server times and whatnot have changed
much over the last couple of years. Their competition already knows
all they need to know about when EverQuest's server are at full
capacity and when they are well below capacity. They already know how
may people subscribe to EverQuest, because Smedley and Verant have
been very vocal about this. I'm not sure what else Verant would be
trying to hide.
