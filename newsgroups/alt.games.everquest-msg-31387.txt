Backpedal much?

RFCs are not rules, any more than they are laws. They are standards
and guidelines.

I'm not changing the headers - I'm originating them.

Ah, but I am. The "rules" you refer to specify the format of the
address, and the function. My address is correctly formatted, and it
serves the intended function.

You're the one making the positive claim - the burden of proof lies
with you.

However, since it's obvious that you've never actually read (or at
least, didn't comprehend) the RFCs you referenced, perhaps I'd do well
to post the relevant portions of them...

From RFC 822, section 4.4.3

>This field provides a general mechanism for indicating any

I am the message originator, and the reply-to field directs the
replies as I intended.


From RFC 1036, section 2

>Certain headers are required, and certain other headers are optional. 
>[...]
>The optional header lines are "Followup-To", "Expires", "Reply-To"

From RFC 1036, section 2.2.1. Reply-To 

>This line has the same format as "From". If present, mailed replies to 
>the author should be sent to the name given here.

The format of my optional reply-to address is correct.

Ahh, another variation on the tired old "Get a life" rejoinder. How
terribly original of you.
