Well I started a Halfling Cleric on Firona Vie.  I'm up to lv 10
already.  I grouped with a warrior once so far, but that's it.  It does
seem awfully quiet, along with what appears to be a lot more lag than
I'm accustomed to.  I've done a very marginal amount of RP on FV, what
little I did was well received.  I've done alot more on the regular
server I usually play on, but got alot of d00ds getting P.O.ed when I
did :/

I did have a message about Trivial loot come up once so far, no idea
what for.  I can see how this would be extremely annoying with verious
quests, and you could miss out on alot (unless you are willing to
de-level).  I have a few more questions at this point.

What are these chat channels that suppossedly let you get around the
language barier?

I can't seem to change my alignment.  I'm DN, it gives me the option to
change to N, NG, and DG.  I'm trying to change to DG (#7), but when I
type "/alignment 7" it doesn't change.

Is there a NG or Buliten Board for this server?  There's one for my
normal server, I can see how this would be very helpful.

Any reccommended guilds?  I can only play in the morning on the
weekdays, so something with people about my level and times would be
nice.

Would it be worth it going to the warrens.  I've heard they are a great
place to go on other servers, but I'm a bit wary of going that far if I
won't be able to get a group.
