Aye, same here. The couple of times I've opted for forming the group
myself, I've had no trouble. I have noticed, however, that /ooc isn't
nearly as effective as I'd like. Often I have to resort to a /who lfg xx
xx all and some people who didn't respond to the /ooc are more than
happy to join. I think many (I'm guilty of it too) just sort of tune out
/ooc sometimes. 

One group I put together specifically to do the Coolwind Point
lighthouse cellar, only to find that the quest was bugged. Another in
the group stepped up with a tip on a really nice quest (for one in their
low teens) originating in Willow Wood that took us around Antonica a bit
and rewarded us with a very nice weapon, xp and coin. 

Overall, I've had pretty good experiences grouping, as you said, when
people know what the goal is up front.
