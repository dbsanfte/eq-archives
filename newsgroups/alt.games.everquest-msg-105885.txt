  The Nexus portal spires are pretty buggy still.  There used to be (maybe
still is) a bug that would teleport you up to Luclin even if you weren't
holding a stone.  This one hit my friends and I a few times in a row one
night, making what would have been a simple rendevous a huge, time consuming
frustration.  Today a guildmate of mine was teleported to the Greater
Faydark "safe spot" while standing between the G. Faydark spires when the
Luclin teleport went off.  Unfortunately for him, he was a dark elf shadow
knight and was KOS to the guards that hang around the G. Faydark "safe
spot."

  The GM who responded to him an hour or so later told him, (despite his
/reporting of the text that demonstrated that what he claimed did indeed
happen) that this is a "function of the spires" or something along those
lines, and said that and that there was nothing he could do.  Anyway, save
yourself some potential grief and inconvenience by standing clear of the
spires if you don't intend on using them.
