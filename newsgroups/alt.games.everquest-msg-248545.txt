You can also get to FT4 with tribute points if you have the GoD expansion.
These can come in handy for raids or LDoN adventures.  Which, by the way,
have several FT augs to purchase.  The lowest being 340 points FT1 toa 1450
FT2 aug.

You might begin working on the Coldain Prayer Shawls.  #7 is FT1 and #8 is
FT3.

Hope this helps,
