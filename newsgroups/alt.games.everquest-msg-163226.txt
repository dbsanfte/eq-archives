Your MA was a 60 Ranjah and you wiped out on Prince?  The problem wasn't
the MA. It was the one chanter only. That section of Chardok can be
insane for adds, but for all the jokes I (and others) make about Ranjah
Down! there's no reason even a moderately equipped Ranger can't tank
down to there. Adds are your problem. Either that or you just fell into
the traps and wiped out. 

As to your puller... usually we use two monks in a tag team to pull
there and they generally still suck up a couple deaths. Splitting in
there can be a stupidly hard job. A well tuned masterful monk team can
be a beautiful thing to watch. An incompetent puller can be death as
soon as poor crowd control. SK's can be great pullers, don't get me
wrong, but with all the casters in there and such, and the danger of the
SK FD spell failing or something, it's a bit much to ask.

So I think the MA wasn't your problem. Your support crew was.
