I can only speak for myself, but I could not care less about the new
content that they've added/are adding. There's still so much potential
in the old world that goes unrealized, and quite frankly, space aliens

Fantasy setting.

This is partly the reason I quit in the first place, it was just
becoming too far from "fantasy".
