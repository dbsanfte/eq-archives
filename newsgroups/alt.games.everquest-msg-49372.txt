In UO you had something to lose in DAoC you lose nothing but 5 minutes
of time.

Who said PvE was vapid? It's no more Vapid then it is in EQ. Yes it's
a new product and doesn't have 2 years of retail dev time into it but
the devs have said they would expand both RvR and PvE aspects of the
game. The first expansion is due in the spring which features the
newer net immerse engine adaptation  and more textures  skins and mob
models.

Then they will be quadrupled. Or Octupled.  The Home realms will not
be invaded by pkers. Mythic has stated that should it happen the way
it happened will be found and fixed.

Hmm actually no a Pker gets his rocks of on the frustration of his
prey. if the prey doesn't respond then the Pker only gains loot, of
course that can't happen in Daoc nor can pking, since the only place
PvP occurs is in the frontiers which you have to voluntarily go to.
