I love to reinvent the wheel.  Seriously, you really only ever do things 
the way others before you have done them?  You never look for your own 
way, or a way that might be a bit better?

Turn away shaves several milliseconds off my reaction time.  First time 
its ever bitten me in the butt.

I'm not saying its the best way, or even an acceptable way...

But I'm astonished that it amazes you that I did something in a 
different way.  How... grey....  your world would be for me to live in.

Could be.  Same raid leader would, however, be cheering when one of my 
clever schemes actually works better, say, for example (and no this 
wasn't my idea) using blind and flash to split the council.  I've been 
using the thing from time to time on other unsnarable mobs, and it was a 
big help here even though it didn't work as described.

You have me in your guild,  you're gonna have to accept that I don't 
always do things the orthodox way, sometimes thats gonna suck, usually 
its just gonna be amusing, and sometimes its gonna pay off.  I've yet to 
be removed from a guild, so I guess on average its a plus.

Oh, quickest possible interaction?  No, my fingers are ON the move 
arrows.  I'm constantly fiddling around with facing, or sliding over a 
little, so on and so forth.  To press the attack off button I have to

lift



my



finger


from


arrow



key


drift



up



to



equals  (where I remapped my attack because A is simply mindbogglingly 
bad key for autoattack)



press



a veritable eternity in that slow motion time when you realize that the 
mob is about to enrage.

compare to

press left arrow

Wait till no longer facing mob

Release

Is it the best plan?  Probably not, for the specific reason I just hit 
here.  But is it a bad plan?  Well, its faster, and in over a year of 
tanking this is the first time its bitten me in the butt.
