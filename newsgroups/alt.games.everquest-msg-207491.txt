Unlike Runnyeye its got no real crossing overs - its a lot more linear.
THere is one bit off the route to the Prince that is quite circuitous and
not a place to lose your bearing if the mobs aggro you and the extensive
brown can lose you a bit over by the Muglewump  but its a LOT friendlier
than Runnyeye. If anything Id expect it to be easier to navigate by
learning it than using 2D map to memorise.

The run through to Stonbrunt is pretty linear
