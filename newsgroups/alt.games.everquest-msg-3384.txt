Head of Ghanex Drah I believe. He's a gnoll necromancer in South Karana.
This head is the easy to get part of a monk quest (red headband maybe?)
which involves collecting several heads.  Any monk able to get the rest
of the heads can easily off Ghanex Drah, and he doesn't wander like the
others, so unless you're a monk I would just sell it back to a merchant.
