Aye, if you walk in during the day expect to be jumped hard and fast. Go
in well after nightfall.

During the day, Seafarer's Roost is a hang out for Paladins on the Steel
Warriors(?) faction. (Might have the name off, but they will 100%
guaranteed be KOS to you)

At night, Seafarers Roost is a hang out for, shall we say, the darker side
of FP society.
