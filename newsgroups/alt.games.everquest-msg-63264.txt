The soccer analogy, as others have mentioned, is really less than
perfect since the two "gaming environments" are so different. That said,
it's still true that somebody coming in and violating the rules can
detract from the enjoyment and participation of the others. Personally,
I can ignore all but the most blatant ones, but for the serious RPers I
can see how "Krakhoor Sallie" running around asking everyone to cyber
with her might be a bit of a detraction from the fantasy gaming
environment.
