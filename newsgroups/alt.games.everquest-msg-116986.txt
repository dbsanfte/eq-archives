He is right on how it works. The problem or what makes a difference between
who it works and what you have been told by a GM is that the GMs are telling
the "offical Verant" stance on the subject. They tell you it is 3 hours,
period. That way when something goes wrong and you lose experience because
you did not get a rez by camped instead, they do not have to deal with the
problem. You have been told it is 3 hours, period. It does not matter if the
software works slightly different, it is 3 hours period. It does not matter
if they decide to make a stealth change to it tomorrow to make it an actual
true 3 hour time, the official stance it 3 hours period.

What this means is that if you camp, you will have some extended time up to
24 hours after the death to be rezed. The software allows you to be rezed
somewhere up to 24 hours after death if you happen not to be online anytime
during that 24 hours. But if something should go wrong with the system and
the server does not regester you as being logged off, GMs do not have to
deal with the petition problems that may arise since it is their stance to
that the timer is 3 hours, period.

PS> Personally, I think the 3 hour rez time is the biggest crock of shit in
the game as a part of the death penalty. It punishes those that try to
maximize their playing time and happen to die at the very end of that
playing time. Especially if that playing time happens to include raid
deaths.
