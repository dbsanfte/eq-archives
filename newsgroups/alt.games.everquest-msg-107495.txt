And it still has a better damage/mana ratio that Cleric nukes.

You are right.  I missed Judgement and I was off on the mana cost on
Moonfire, druids level 60 cold based nuke.  Does 1100 for 450 mana.
Worse ratio.  It's what you get for posting when you got 10 minutes to
get ready for work.

THAT said, druids ALSO get Ancient Starfire of Ro, which does 1125
damage for 325 mana.  Ratio of 3.46 there.  Puts them well above
clerics once again.

ADDING to that, is the fact that Judgement has an almost 10 second
recast time vs. druids instant recast time.  Makes a big difference in
offensive firepower.

As a matter of fact, it seems that all of clerics high level general
purpose nukes have at least a 9 second recast time.  So in the time it
takes a cleric to get off one nuke (roughly 14 seconds) a druid can
get off TWO nukes.

Don't ya love Casters Realm?

Actually, with the Ancient Spell, Druids are about 18% better, and can
nuke faster.  So yeah, I'd say they leave clerics way, way, way behind
in nuking power.
