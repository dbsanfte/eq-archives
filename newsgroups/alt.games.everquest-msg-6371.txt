my lower level characters look like heavy metal rock stars with all the hand
me downs, but my main resembles the partridge family bus with all of his
functional equiptment

the main has the stats, the lower levs have the looks......... maybe the

and just like there in no way to "win", there is no "end"

makes it feel like less of a game and more like a hobby  :)
