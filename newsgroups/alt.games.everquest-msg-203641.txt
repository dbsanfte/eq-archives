Heh, that's one mighty slow to bake "cake".  I tired of soloing a
very lightly twinked Half Elf Warrior at L32 (no haste, just a few
pieces of Crafted which would be easy to obtain without twinking
nowadays, his weapons were slightly inferior to what can be gotten
cheaply nowadays).  While I can imagine soloing a Warrior past 50,
it'd take some mighty entertaining guildchat to keep me awake at
the keyboard.
