Hi folks,

On monday I decided to load up EQ for the first time in a few months.  When
I did I received a message saying "your PC Action sponsored account will end
in 12 days." It said I would have to start paying 12.95USD per month after
that. I found this to be strange because I upgraded to the SOE All Access
plan in August when I purchased Planetside. I emailed the Accounts people
asking if they knew why I'm getting the message, explaining that I had never
heard of PC Action and that I had the All Access plan. I recieved the
following response:

This was a promotion put out by PC Action, you will have accss to your
account for 11days [sic] or however many as stated by the message. If you
choose to keep the account the fee will be the normal 12.95 /mo.

Plenty of info that wasn't in the message I was receiving from logging in.
So, I sent a reply. Again, I said that I didn't sign up for a PC Action
promotion. I also restated that I was paying for the All Access plan and
added that the EQ account was pre-existing. The response was:

It is a promotion.
Here's a copy of the 14 day promotional in case you missed it.
[explanation of promtion for people with deactivated accounts]

After reading this, I remembered seeing that message in my email. Yet, I
don't see what it has to do with me, my account was never deactivated, it
was upgraded. Is everyone receving this message? If so, it is a totally
ineffecient way of handling such a promotion. Maybe the accounts folks just
don't know how to read.

TIA,
Allen Bouchard
