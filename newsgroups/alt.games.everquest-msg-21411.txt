Class A - very casual player, 1-3 hours a week "its a nice game"
Class B - casual player, 1-2 hours most nights "I love this game"
Class C - Avid player, 3-4 hours a night, some on weekends "Have! to! make
next level"
Class D - Semi-Addicted player, 5+ hours a night, every weekend (but single
account and system) "I remember going to movies/events/dates"
Class E - Fully-Addicted player, Time is no limit! (minimum of dual accounts
and systems) "My Real Life ALT used to be a systems manager"
Class F - ?

where do you all fit in?

I'd probably fit in somewhere between C and D.  I got to thinking about this
when over the past few nights, I grouped with some in the class "e" people.
One was a 40 warrior who was dragging around a 50+ druid for buffs, snares
and heals.  Very fast keyboard work though and we pulled mobs FAST.  Then, I
got a tell from a good in-game friend who admitted he finally broke down and
got another account and was powerleveling himself!. sigh (/em Orlun starts
to think about that old second computer sitting over in the corner.... Just
maybe...)
