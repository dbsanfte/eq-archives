Here's your problem.

FPShooters like Q3/UT etc. spend all their time on graphics, then bolt
it onto a fairly simple framework - sprites that do a limited number of
things, in a limited number of ways. OK, I know it's not quite as simple
as that, but what I'm trying to say is that those types of games can
spend a great proportion of their budget on graphical elements, and then
bolt the onto the game at the very last minute, incorporating the very
latest technology.

EQ's framework is 4-5 years old, hence designed around the tech
available at the time. They've done a hell of a let to try and
frankenstein some new tech into it (especially graphics) but they're
always held back by their relatively prehistoric foundations. Add to
that that they're also getting paid a monthly fee by people playing on
the inherently outdated PCs, they're understandably reluctant to raise
the system specs as often as necessary to stay in the frontline of
visually stunning eyecandy.

EQ has had (to my knowledge) 3 specific system hikes in it's history.
W98, 128mb ram, DX8. Each one caused rumbles of discontent with existing
customers being forced to upgrade. What's the specs for UT3? The people
buying that game can do so with the knowledge of what they need to play,
a big difference between raising the specs on a game you've already
'paid' for
