Better. The software was more than that for me.

Include air shipping for the expansion direct from VI, lets call it 550.

Hmmm. I have upgraded hardware solely for EQ.

Probably ... hell, my last upgrade was to an AMD XP 1800 with 512mb of
DDR ram and a GeForce 3 500 when it was the biggest thing you could buy.

Its nice having the extra power for everything else I do, but I wouldnt
have *needed* it if not for luclin.

Thats my only EQ driven upgrade, so I guess the total for me is, what,
$1500?

Wow ;) I think I'm just gonna get some custom narcotics cooked up for me ;)

Shrug. Time well spent as far as I'm concerned. A hobby I enjoy with
people I like. Not like its stopping me working and earning or nurturing
my RL or anything. Much more fun than passively watching TV or the other
junk I'd do when home tired from a day at work.
