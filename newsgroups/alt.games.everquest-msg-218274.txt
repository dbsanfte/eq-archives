/agree with a few exceptions.  I have a pair of hotkeys for farming hoppers
with chant kite.  They each do 2 chants.  I also have a hotkey for
manapumping between fights when some are lom that sings cantata of
replenishment and the pure manasong.  I dont use either much lately, but
sometimes they are handy.
