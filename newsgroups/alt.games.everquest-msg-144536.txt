Pretty much the same on BB, out of my range at the moment.
Sold my FBSS while sleeping and picked up some SCHW before I left for
work...then realised if I had pooled my plat I could prolly have afforded
that Silvery Belt of Contention...oh well, I'm sure there isn't one for sale
atm.
Will be picking up the Velium Fire Wedding rings later this weekend,
although as I am currently in the process of farming Velium pieces for a
friend...I don't think I'll be wearing them just yet.
