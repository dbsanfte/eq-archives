Any general idea where the traps are?  I know it doesn't
matter if you're hidden when you trip it.  In dawnshroud, you
can trigger a whole mushroom grove, but if you're sneak/hiding,
the mushrooms just stand around. The assassins see invis.

It IS funny to see a blood starved wolf jump out ready to
kill...and then just stand there...:-).

Bastards. This makes no sense to me.  I understand if
I get jumped in Dawnshroud, it's up to me to defend myself.
What the hell kind of city could a mugger attempt to kill
somebody DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE POLICE and
they don't even say "stop that,  son?" If you got jumped in
a dark alley, you could at least attempt to run to the police
(city guards).  If you get within their sight, they should  help
you. Again, not much of their fault if you were jumped behind
a building or something, but with SoW up you should be able
to run RIGHT TO the guards and say, "HEY ASSHOLE!  This
guy is trying to kill me.  Not only that, he's an assassin and
will kill some of your own citizens if he succeeds in killing
me."

Wouldn't that  sorta ellicit a response?
