To avoid the same thing happening next time, you should make a
hotkey for the /loc command.  You'll almost always have enough time
to press a single key before you die.

Yes, asking in PoK would be a good start.  Use the /ooc channel,
and send a message like this: "Anyone willing to locate a corpse
in Innothule?"

You probably shouldn't send a /tell directly to anyone, as that's
considered somewhat rude.

If you can't find anyone to help, try going to the bazaar and seeing
if there are any Chipped Bone Rods for sale cheap.  This item will
point you towards your corpse.  You must be in the same zone as
your corpse, and have yourself targeted.
