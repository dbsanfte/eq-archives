Looking at Castersrealm, I find the following paragraph:

"Researching is a skill which becomes available to Enchanters from level 
16 onwards.  It initially only requires 1 point to be placed in the 
skill to begin your training.  Research rises very quickly, generally 
you will get a point of skill for every attempt, or every second 
attempt.  Pouring all your spare points into research isn't really a 
good idea early on.  You may wish to save these for trade skills or some 
other purpose. "

Now its been ages since I looked into research but this advise directly 
contradicts my experience and conclusions.

I found pages hard to come by, and failures painful in the extreme.  
This being the case, I wanted maxed out skill on every try.  This meant 
5 points per level -before- trying anything I actually wanted to succede 
on. 

By coincedence, you get 5 points every time you level.  And there are 
really hardly any useful places to put them as a caster; weapons 
skills?  Don't make me laugh, but if you -want- to use a weapon, then it 
levels up by itself as you do, and being 5 points behind isn't going to 
make any real difference.  Trade skills?  I can't think of a trade skill 
I'd put more than a point into, the first 21 are always dead easy to get 
compared to say the 101 to 121 points, if you are serious about the 
skill then the skipping the first 21 points to save yourself five 
minutes work is rediculous.  Spell casting skills?  Well this is 
tempting, but you can improve them all by sitting in POK casting on 
yourself or your pet if you need a target; time consuming but free.  
Whats left?  Specializations.  See Casting skills above.  Dodge.  One 
point, my experience tells me, is more than enough, particularly with 
the ludicrously low caps we get on the skill.

Practice research?  This was a worse joke than raising research 
naturally, with each rune having some rare drop part, and requiring you 
to hit multiple zones on multiple continents for each; I don't recall 
anyone back when I was doing this who even tried to defend practice runes

Only Research seems to me to qualify for "major pain to raise" status 
and "Important to raise" status at the same time.

Now I do recall concluding that for a mage, the trick was to not start 
doing research until level 25; I think the idea was that there were no 
useful spells you couldn't buy until level 24, and something having to 
do with the points you got for spending  the first point, versus the 
research skill cap per level, meant that level 25 was the most efficient 
point to start the skill, in terms of not blowing so many free points.  
The fact that I've subsequently decided that all those points I was 
saving are pretty much worthless for other purposes makes this tidbit 
less interesting, if I even recall it right in the first place.

The other question is, is it actually worth getting this skill at all.  
Research components are hard to come by, as they generally drop off mobs 
at the spell level to five levels higher than the spell level.  This 
means that to get the components for a spell when you want the spell to 
scribe, you need to kill mobs that are even con or higher.  -And- they 
rarely drop everything you need in one zone, no, you need to fight some 
here and some there for good odds of completing a set.  Leveling 
normally means fighting in one zone for several levels, not fighting in 
several zones in one level... even if you could figure out which zones 
are good odds to drop the missing pages you need.

That leaves the bazaar as the source of those pages.  Trouble there is, 
once you've gone to the length of shopping in bazaar for pages, why not 
just buy the spell already researched?

Are there any no drop research only spells?  Or is pursuing this really 
the same sort of fools game as becoming a tailor?
