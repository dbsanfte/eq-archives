Someone in my guild had the same problem. Entire screen was so dark
that all she could see was the chat text (and even that was hard to
read). This was in full-screen mode, not in a window. Windows and all
other games on her machine were fine. Reboots and reinstalling drivers
made no difference.

She has still not got it sorted. Sorry I am not posting anything
helpful - just thought you might like to know that you are not the
only person with this problem.

If/when she solves it I'll post the solution here :)
