I took Nova up there today.

Well, I *tried* to take Nova up there today.  I'd camped in SK, so I
gated back to the firepots, and on consideration decided to take the
Felwithe book (I invis and run to the GFay spires when I want to get
to Nexus - that is, I *used* too - WOOHOO!) as that was the only one I
knew for sure where it was.  Run up, click, 1 second wait - wow, that
was quick, I'm gonna love this z-... wait, "you have entered Greater
Faydark"??? Where the hell am -- ARGH! NEWBIE LIFT!

After a panicked "what the FUCK????" to my guild (poor guild :)) and
much panicky running as I tried to get out from under Kelethin without
running into one of those "let's jump off the ledge and see what we
can kill" guards, one of my guildies said "you did remember to
register the expansion, right?"

Ryou
(oops)
(but BOY DO I LOVE THIS EXPANSION! ::hugs it tight::)
