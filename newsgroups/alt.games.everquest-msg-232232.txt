Hi people.  I'd like to start getting into some raids but I've heard from 
others that some raid groups won't accept you unless you have gear that 
bumps your stats sufficiently.

I have a few thou plat I can spend in the bazaar.  What would you recommend 
a youngish 50 druid wear?  What should my resists look like to be ready for 
a raid?

I've been camping in Umbral Planes trying to get all my Elysian pieces but 
I'm afraid when I'm done, they won't be good enough.

M
