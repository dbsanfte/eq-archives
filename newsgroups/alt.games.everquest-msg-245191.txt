}Torqued means twisted or screwed(actually the force that is doing the
}twisting) . I sort of understand vertically twisted (i.e. screwed up) but
}torqued off is a new one for me.
}Could you gimme some of the symptoms you experience while being torqued off
}so i can more properly understand your usage of it?

To me 'torqued off' is what happens when you tighten a nut to too high a 
torque.  The stud breaks.  The way you feel, holding a broken half a stud 
with a nut on it, and knowing you're now gonna have to get screw 
extractors and spend an hour trying to pull the other half of the stud out 
of the engine?  That's torqued off.

But when I'm merely extremely angry about something, I usually spell it 
'torked off', for no particular reason.
