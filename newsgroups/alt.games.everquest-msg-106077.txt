No, start now. The way it is designed is for you to have your 6 points
by the time you are 55 so you can then start getting the archetype
abilities, have those out of the way so you can  then start to get
your 59 class abilities at 59. People 60 in the game now will tell you
to get to 60 before you start putting in points, this is ridiculous.
Many of these skills will HELP you get to 60 and make the trip more
fun. For example as a beast lord the first six points might be 3 run
speed and 3 regen. Everyone does 3 run speed since you might be in an
indoor area. The 3 regen would be nifty with iksar regen.

It might be a good idea to put at least 20 percent in AA, perhaps up
to 50 percent while grouping. At times you might feel like getting
more regular xp but you can always slide it over to 100 percent then.

I was 55 when the points went in and wished I was 51 instead. Now at
56 I only have 1.7 AA points. Its just really nice to have at least
one xp bar that moves fast.
