/rant on with authoritah!

So there I was in PoK with my fairly new shaman, just kind of doing some 
house cleaning, clearing out much of the junk I've accumulated in the 
bank, when I hear (true name withheld):

[Sat May 31 10:46:48 2003] Soandso says out of character, 'Casting SoW in 
front of bank for a donation just opin up a trade window'

I couldn't help but notice they were a halfling druid, but that's for 
another thread. Well, as I am fussing with all my junk at the bank 
teller, I hear him the following exchange:

[Sat May 31 10:47:28 2003] Soandso says out of character, 'Any 1 want 
Sow'
[Sat May 31 10:47:33 2003] Poorschmuck says, 'Soandso i do'
[Sat May 31 10:47:48 2003] Soandso says, 'I will for a donation'

This same type of thing happens to a couple more people. Now, maybe it's 
just me, but I will normally offer up a SoW to anyone who asks nicely as 
a gesture of good will. I don't accept donations, though I will normally 
share in a good brew with the recipient if they feel so inclined. :)

So, I decided to plop down outside the bank and:

[Sat May 31 10:55:20 2003] You say out of character, 'Casting SoW at 
bank. No donation required - look for the tiny little barbarian'
...
[Sat May 31 10:56:18 2003] Soandso tells you, 'Hey i was here first'
[Sat May 31 10:56:30 2003] You told Soandso, 'You're kidding me, right?'

As I sat there doling out some serious spirit of the feral persuasion, I 
hear:

[Sat May 31 10:58:39 2003] Kindsoul#1 says out of character, 'MGB Aego at 
the bank 4 mins :)'

I think, "Cool. Looks like a party," so I shuffle on over with the rest 
of the crowd to accept the generous gesture and offer my thanks. I 
counted some 58 people from my log that received his gift on that 
particular cast. "Everyone helpful, everyone is kind, on the road to 
Sha..." er, ahem. Anyway, just minutes later, what do I hear but:

[Sat May 31 11:06:02 2003] KindSoul#2 shouts, 'MASS KEI AT THE BANK'

I look around thinking, "that's gonna take all day to group with 
everyone, six at a time, cast, and then...ZING!" I had KEI. I had no idea 
there was a way to cast it, especially on lower level players, without 
grouping, but there it was.

So I says to myself, I said, "Self, though you don't normally go out of 
your way for KEI out of principle, well, now you've got it. Let's go tear 
it up!" and I headed for Paludal, an appropriate area for my level 19-
edness. I get there and the place is pretty crowded as usual, but I 
noticed there was no one parked on the hill in the left half of B1, so I 
hopped on over there an proceeded to slow my first victim...who promptly 
whistled for her friend to come along. No trouble. I rooted one, backed 
up a little and rooted the second and proceeded to DoT the heck out of 
them. Things are going great as I med between root and DoT refreshes, 
when a ranger comes scurrying over the hill and tags one of them as his 
buddy plinks away with a bow at the other. The warrior with the bow is a 
decent fellow I had grouped with the night before, and quickly realized 
why the mob wasn't moving. The ranger, on the other hand, kept wailing 
away until the mob he was on dropped. Luckily, I had done over half the 
damage. I toss out a diplomatic:

[Sat May 31 15:53:07 2003] You told RudeRanger#1, 'Please make sure the 
mob you are attacking is not already engaged.  :)'

No response. I figure this could turn into a lose/lose situation real 
quick, so I decide to check out B2. Upon arriving I notice a lot of 
commotion in the middle of the camp. Someone is keeping pretty busy 
there. I sneak around to the little alcove in the back with the campfire 
and proceed to clear it. When all mobs had dropped, I sit to med. About 
the time the first mob should be repopping, a new group of five players 
comes stampeding up after seeing the main camp taken. They more or less 
surround me and begin mulling about. I'm dumbfounded:

[Sat May 31 16:12:26 2003] You say, 'You guys are REALLY going to do 
this, then?'
[Sat May 31 16:12:36 2003] JerkSep says, 'Do what?'
[Sat May 31 16:12:39 2003] JerkSci says, 'Do what?'
[Sat May 31 16:12:46 2003] JerkSep says, 'Do what man'
[Sat May 31 16:12:49 2003] You say, 'Stomp all over my little corner of 
the zone here.'
[Sat May 31 16:12:55 2003] JerkJoo says, 'Oh, should we invite [Me]?'
--- That last comment actually made me laugh...
[Sat May 31 16:13:01 2003] JerkSep says, 'Ooh sorry didnt know it was 
yours'
[Sat May 31 16:13:04 2003] JerkJoo says, 'Sorry man. Didn't see you.'
[Sat May 31 16:13:12 2003] JerkSci says, 'I don't think it is. I don't 
see a name on it anywhere.'
[Sat May 31 16:13:15 2003] You say, 'Not mine, per se, but I WAS keeping 
it cleared.'
[Sat May 31 16:13:19 2003] JerkDel tells you, 'Sorry we did nt know you 
had corner'
[Sat May 31 16:13:58 2003] JerkSep invites you to join a group.

As sorry as they were (uh huh), none suggested their leaving and letting 
me get on with my business. And to illustrate the maturity of those with 
whom I was dealing:

[Sat May 31 16:17:29 2003] JerkSci tells the group, 'GUys watch my back 
for a minute, I gotta take a dump'

Two bandit pop and they immediately pounce and take them out. I am 
fuming, but decide that I should probably take the high road and I join 
their group. Xp slows down to a trickle. Solo, I had been getting more 
than a blue bubble for every mob. Grouped, and sitting most of the time 
since there weren't enough mobs to support a full group, it was hardly 
moving. After a short bit, I decided I'd had enough:

[Sat May 31 16:30:49 2003] You tell your party, 'Sorry folks. The fun's 
been sucked out of this spot for me. It's now a big waste of my free KEI 
and Aego. Enjoy it.'

I gated and disbanded.

[Sat May 31 16:31:24 2003] JerkDel tells you, 'Sorry cya'
[Sat May 31 16:32:24 2003] You told JerkDel, 'Yeah. Right you are. No 
worries. You've all just made it onto my special list.'

And thus, my Jerk List was born.  :(
