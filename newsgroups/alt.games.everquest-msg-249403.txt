Well, the OP was asking about zones that were populated, not the best
newbie zone.

As for Shadeweaver's Thicket, I'm actually not super fond of
it...although I like the zones adjacent to it.  I recently started up
a few new characters, a mage and a druid.  Both of them I took to the
pit underneath Shar Vahl to get to level 4 (or 5), to get their second
tier spells.  The druid was duoing with a necromancer, the mage was
solo.  Neither one equipped with more than 2k in gear, so "moderately"
twinked by today's standards.  The pit is a nice place to exp...no
social aggro, and a good range of low levels.  Shadeweaver's has a
much higher range of levels, but I have problems with social aggro all
the time.

After that, the druid went to Crushbone and then to Paludal Caverns
once he hit level 9, and he's now level 10 and I haven't played him in
a while.  Once the mage hit level 4 and got his new spells, including
the pets, I stopped by PoK and picked up some free pet toys (someone
was giving them away) on the way to Paludal.  I got to level 8 in 3
hours solo, which I thought was pretty cool.  I was killing red cons
in PC that gave me 20% experience per kill.  If you want to level up a
pet class quickly...man, that's really the way to go.  Haven't played
him any more since then, really enjoying my Beastlord, but it was fun
to do that.  I might switch all the stuff back to my necromancer
instead, the utility and soloability is really looking good to me
right now, what with the lack of people online.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
