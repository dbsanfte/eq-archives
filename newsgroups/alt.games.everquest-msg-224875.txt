Heh, running across Dreadlands, have aggro from two Raging Drolvargs, I 
was level 40 something, had just sowed myself after zoning in.  So, I go 
to root one of them off, they made very quick work of me.  The ranger I 
was with made a valiant effort, even healing me out of unconsciosness 
once.  Low health aggro was too much to overcome however.
