Yes, that was a very good response and i agree whole heartedly.  The paces
in which wizards can do this are limited. I will not argue.  However from
level 16 onwards there are multiple zones it can be acomplished in, you just
have to know where to hunt.  But by pointing this out you also pointed out
that rangers can only solo effiecently in zones with animals in.  There is a
post under the soloing section on www.graffe.com Forums.  One Wizard there
soloed a phase spider in Dragon Necropolis,  this is quite a feat,
considering wizards are not too well designed to solo single mobs (our
soloing power comes from quad kiting) If you can take a lvl 60 ranger to DN
and do the same thing i will admit i was mistaken and will re-evaluate my
thoughts on Rangers.

    FYI i am a very big fan of the ranger class, i feel they can be
extremely useful in almost all grouping situations and on raids, so this is
by no means a bash at rangers.  I salute anyone who plays one as they are a
class which takes skill to play well.
