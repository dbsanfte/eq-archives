I use a 21inch Sony (CRT) & would not give it up for any LCD, flat as they
may be, light as a feather and relativly cheap nowdays... they still lack in
sharpness, crisp vivid textures, bright colors and half decent refresh
rates.

Now, I have piped my box out to a large HDTV (Sony Wega) & got semi decent
results, after all, it's just a huge monitor but the refresh still sucked.

I ran my box via' a 50 inch Plasma (ultimate in flat screen if you ask me, 4
inches thick & wall mounted), pretty much the same results as the large
screen HDTV.

Looks great across the room, looks crap up close.

Maybe when they come up with an LCD flat panel that will refresh at 100 with
a res of 1280 X 1024 @ 32bit that costs less than say $1,500.. then I might
get one as a second / third monitor.

You just can't beat a CRT for high res gaming, video & DVD that you can see
without having to be 2 feet away & in a direct line (square) of view...

If you like the idea of nobody being able to see your screen from any view
other than leaning over your shoulder directly in line with the LCD.... then
get a good CRT & buy a privacy screen / filter.

In short.....  CRT over LCD any day of the week.

(All the above words are just a little bit of my own opinion on the matter &
are not in any way, shape or form trying to insite a flame war over CRTs &
LCDs).
