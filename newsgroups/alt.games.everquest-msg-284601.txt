Make the most of it tho'.... 'Cos according to the postings on the new
expansion (open posts - not beta forums) green pet pulling will be
nerfed.

Mobs will in future look at the level of the pet owner not the pet
when deciding whether to be social or not.

Sony have decided that it was really a longstanding bug - not an
intended feature so they are going to fix it.

There have been howls of rage from mages everywhere but it looks like
it is going through 'cos a few bards and monks said it was unfair....
