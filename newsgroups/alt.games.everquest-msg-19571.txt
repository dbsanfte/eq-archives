Then you haven't bothered to think about it very much.  Here
are several reasons:

1.  People who buy high-level characters won't know what in
the HELL they're doing with them, which will screw up the
game experience for players who get caught in the consequences.
(Picture a high-level group in a Sebilis raid, when the
55 Warrior says, "What do you mean 'taunt off', what's taunt?"
It has happened.)  Barring eBay says ensures that the people
behind a level X character actually have X levels of skill
in playing that character.

2.  People who play high level characters get some well-deserved
respect for having achieved high levels.  That goes to hell
if half the people driving high-level characters just got them
by plunking down some cash on eBay for them.  Barring eBay sales
protects the pride of achievement.  Otherwise, it's like
being able to buy military medals at K-Mart, it devalues it
for everyone.

3.  When characters and items can be sold for money, it
encourages a flood of "entrepreneurs" who flog the game
like a cash cow, gameplay be damned.  How likely is
your group to be able to have a shot at the FBSS when
it's being camped 24/7 by guys who say "screw u
fairy g4merz, I'm trying to pay my rent here"?  
Banning eBay sales keeps the game a GAME.

4.  Everquest, like most games, is supposed to be a
place where we can get away from RL problems and
enjoy a different kind of world.  Personally, I'd
rather not have a bright but poor (in RL) kid
be at a disadvantage in Norrath against a
stupid but rich (in RL) guy who can afford to
plunk down money to get the best gear in the game.
Real life financial situations shouldn't matter
in the game, everyone should start as the same
naked newbie and succeed or fail on their own
skills, on an equal basis.

5.  It adds to the roleplay, "Norrath is an
actual world" feeling when a character is
played by the same person forever, and if/when
that person leaves, the character fades away
for good (almost as if they were dying).  It
makes for a real sense of continued community
and identity, which is shattered if a lot
of characters are "so who is Furryfoot *this*
week?"  It's much more of an immersive feeling
when, if you run into Ladaren after not having
seen him for a few months, you can be pretty
sure it's the same guy you used to group with
in Mistmoore, and he'll remember you too and
you can reminisce about your glorious adventures
and catch up on what's happened since.

6.  Verant probably comes out ahead financially
when people who want to see the high-level game
have to play (and therefore pay) for many months
to get there, as opposed to a merry-go-round of
"tourists" who buy a high-level character, poke
around dungeons for a month or two, then sell
the character off to the next tourist (and
then probably bad-mouth the game because they
never actually "took the journey" of personally
building a character through adventure).

And so on.
