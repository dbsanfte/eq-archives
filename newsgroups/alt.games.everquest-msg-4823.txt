What is this crap. Not welcome here.

You shouldn't presume to speak for everyone in this newsgroup. You should
include a list perhaps, of the people who feel that way, but don't ever go
speaking for me. If I wanted my mind made up for me, there are about 6
billion other people I'd rather have do it before I'd consider you.

As far as I am concerned, he and all his friends are as welcome here as you
are. Maybe more so, because they don't go around speaking on my behalf, as
to who should be welcome and who shouldn't.

You seem to think that people should have to pass an audition before they
get the right to post here. They are here, take a deep breath, accept it,
and get on with the rest of your life.

You keep exhorting people to killfile them.... do it, and then shut up.
