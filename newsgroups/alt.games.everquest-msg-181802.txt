Let me just start by saying that, no matter how this thread goes, no
matter how much I learn or don't discover, no matter whether my initial
impression proves correct or complete and utter horseshit, I just have
that rare gut feeling that I'm going to enjoy the experience immensely.
(As I often do with you on Usenet, James.)

Ok. Right off the bat, I apologize for making one of many assumptions.
I'm not even going to click back to your previous post to check, but
just say that I don't recall you mentioning that there was a previous
agreement about who would and wouldn't kill RZ and in what order. If
there was such an agreement, then you certainly have some ground for
flaming, at least initially and I was wrong and apologize again.

I will take this opportunity to ask, though... who forged this
agreement? I ask this because the background commentary and the history
of guilds on your server that we've read about here make it sound like
one possible scenario at least. You were the guild that could definitely
beat the encounter, but were "nice enough" to allow the others to try a
couple times if they did it by your rules. That is, alone, and not with
help, "zerging", etc. As long as they could prove they were suddenly as
big and bad as you, they were more than welcome to share the wealth. 

This may be totally wrong, but from an objective standpoint, I'm sure
you could see how the totally uniformed visitor might wonder if it were
possible.

Double check me here so I make sure we understand each other. They could
kill the mob with your blessing as long as they did it the way you
specified with only the number of people you specified? If I'm wrong,
please correct me. If they come up with a force capable of killing the
mob and hit it, they get the reward, (in this case flags) yes?

You think? :-)

Do I need to mention that one of the things that angered you in the
preceeding posts was that they were hogging up items for expensive
tradeskill items you could have gotten? Are you there as an altruist,
James? Or would your guild find use for some items that drop from either
RZ or the planes beyond? I never find accusing "greed" towards another
guild a compelling argument, just for the record.

Ok. On this one I'm throwing the gigantic fucking bullshit flag. Let's
assume for a moment that you know for a fact that the e-baying was going
on. It does. We all know that.

Was *everyone* in all the allied guilds in some equal partnership for
the cash benefits of said ebaying? Is it even remotely possible that a
few fuckheads were making money while a bunch of other people were
playing the game and desperately wanting to get to the elemental planes?

>     Other people, like Furor, have mocked them for being unskilled zergs.

If you've resorted to quoting Furor, (and yes, I read FoH web pages
regularly) you've sunk far further than I'd hoped, James. Let's not
forget that, since you made a point of quoting my player history from
posts made here, that it wasn't very long ago you and I were discussing
why you were an unguilded player who couldn't make it into Howling
Stones. You, however, made an immediate jump to a tier one guild on the
server who was doing Emp. Remember your roots, if you would. If only to
keep some balance and perspecive on this.

Ok. Do I need to scroll back up in this very thread and ask you how
their killing of a "loot giving mob" is "blowing everything", but you
taking all the RZ spawns, granted with good loot, when you could be
fighting in Elemental planes is different?

Please see last question.

You know, last time my new twink was trying to get xp at the zone-in in
Paludal somebody trained me. Nothing ever changes.

Please see my comments about your history here above. You want to call
lesser guilds who need more people and who have less experience
"zergtastic" here, James? On your guild's web page, sure. But here?
