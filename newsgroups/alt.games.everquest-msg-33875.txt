I will stick with both EQ and AO, been playing EQ for some time now
and just don't wan't to terminate all my guys, and i do have many.

I have only installed AO and made some patching, now i will only
figure out the references to test server and be on my way, and i would
guess that it would be a horrible slow one, my computer is to old for
this game i think.
