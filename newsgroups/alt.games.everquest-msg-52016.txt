it was nerfed. Basically I and some people I knew and some other
people on about 3 servers, one of them brand new, found out about it
around the same time and found we could buy unlimited rat ears from
that lady in WC. Basically it set off some economy alarms and was
rapidly nerfed but not before my wood elf on a new server had full
leather, bloodforge hammer and spells for several levels. Some people
probably knew about it for a while but this was the first time It was
really in wide use I think.. especially on a new server.

I honestly thought that the quest was meant to be that way.. that you
got a 3.5 plat sellable spell (the shaman 49 malosi spell.. or another
one I think) like every 20th rat ear on purpose and that I and some
other people had just figured out the lady in wc sells unlimited rat
ears so.... Really running from WC to qey hills on a new server at
level 6 with no sow is pretty harrowing so I felt I earned it ;)
It gave some smiths and other tradespeople on the new server quite a
boost starting out also.

It also did not have to be sneed, but could be anyone. I sold the
spells to a vendor in surefall since it was close. Gad a druid or
wizard at 19 could have made a fortune doing this.
