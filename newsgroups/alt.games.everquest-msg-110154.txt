YES. 75 agil is the MINIMUM for ANY CHARACTER or your ac gets hosed. 
For an int caster the difference in ac from 74 agil, to 75 agil (ONE
MORE AGIL) is a whopping 40 ac at level 60. from 70 to 75 it would
likely be more and for a tank its likely to be even more important.

By 60 you'd probably have at least 5 agil on a tanks whole outfit, so
its no huge deal, but in the meantime needing that 5 is going to be a
hassle for you. 75 is the bareminimum, I might make it 80 even for
more of a cushion (some items you get early on might even subtract
agil) 

In phase 3 of the EQ beta I found this out. I made an ogre Sk and did
not add to agil so it was only 70. I found that by level 9, in leather
armor which was pretty good untwinked in the beta, I could not take a
single hit even from a blue con. I was the most untanky tank I'd seen
and wimpy as heck. I restarted as an ogre warrior with my friend
holding my stuff, by nine I was a great tank. I did not even know then
that it was the agil not being 75, I just knew that something was
wrong. It was VERY obvious. 

So get it to at least 75 and if low enough just start over.
