depending on your budget, and the state of your monitor, i'd suggest
picking up a nice refurbished 21" monitor.

i got my girlfriend one for around $300, including shipping (the things
weigh a ton).

being able to run EQ in 32-bit 1600x1200@85Hz mode is definitely worth
it ;)

of course, you might also need to pick up a new video card (top of my
wish list) ;)
