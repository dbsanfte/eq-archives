From the shadows, the mysterious "richard cortese"
<ricortes@earthlink.net> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

Sadly this sort of player is rampant in the PvP crowd. I am not
surprised. As I mentioned a couple times, the implementation of PvP
has to be such that these sorts of players (the ones you just
described) aren't rewarded for anti-social behavior, but still allows
for PvP for a purpose. It *can* be done, but it takes more effort to
balance it than it does for a raw PvE game like EQ because people are
a hell of a lot harder to predict for than AI mobs. :-)

So far we have had in essense two efforts. The first, DAoC, was trying
to be a generalized mmorpg and so sold out the woldly elements in
favor of gamey when it was shown they weren't up to the task of making
RvR worthwhile and balanced. The second, SB, simply didn't have the
skill to pull what they wanted to do off, and the backing to take the
time to put in what they needed to.

That's not enough to judge.

That's not what *I'm* hoping for and even if that is true, much of
what was said was correct in that, even if the author himself, as you
say (or as I think you said) wouldn't be able to survive in it.
Perhaps he should be careful what he wishes for....
