I failed combine on hand made backpack somewhere around 6 times in a row and
tailoring is at the level that makes that item trivial. dunno if its a bug
or just a random occurance, but its only chain failed like that once for me.

I do think that if my level was a few numbers higher than the trivial, it
probably wouldnt fail as often.
