    Yup, if I don't get a /shout, /ooc, /say, or yell for help, I'll usually
just watch, sometimes wave.

    I must admit there are times when even help is asked for (from the
general population not in a direct tell), depending on the person, I might
also just stand and watch. IE if the person has just been a prime
dickhead...

    On the other hand, I have also gone hours out of my way to help someone
who asked me specifically for a summon, and I would consider that normal
behavior for me too. I just think its one of the best things about EQ that
dickheads and idiots very often get killed, and I never want to spoil the
moment for them.

cheers,
James
