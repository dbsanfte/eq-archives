OK, and how many of those do you see in level appropriate zones?  You're 
making straw-man arguments, and they're not even good ones.  Honestly now, 
when is the last time anyone /shouted HELP to warn of a train in any zone 
populated by 50+ (hell, 30+) characters?

No, I'm many things, but certainly not obsessive enough to spend a year 
creating an alter-ego to back myself up in discussions with paranoid 
loons.  Face it biz, you're an anti-social dick, who by his own admission 
either doesn't understand game mechanics or purposely trains people, and 
that behavior is not acceptable to the majority of the EQ playerbase.
