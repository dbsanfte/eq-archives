    Ok. We usually group the person who cures the clerics of the Xegony
effect in with the clerics, since pushing her into position and keeping her
there is an inexact science at best.

    Eat the AoE, get cured and healed.

    Having someone do SS after the AoE wouldn't be a bad idea. ;-)

    Yeah, without the AoE he's very easy to kill. I don't know if they just
toned down the range significantly, or if it's missing entirely. I suspect
the latter.

    You never use SR? And the CH thing is funny - during a recent practice
session on Rathe Council, I got back-to-back 8925 point CH's on the tank.
I'd never even seen one before that.

    You've nicely explained my opinion of people I meet with the "Exarch"
title that don't have 300+ AA's. Ego trip. I do make an exception for people
who earned the title well before PoP release, though.

    I can think of one justification: there isn't anything to do when you're
online and not raiding. I've got a few New Tanaan points for precisely that
reason. The few guild groups fill up fast, and I want to continue to improve
Delores and not some twink. And I love tradeskills.

    You'll do it earlier than that, I think you'll find. Especially if you
have a low opinion of the healing AA's.
