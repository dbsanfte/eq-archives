I'd suggest going to piercing while you're at a low level, Walrus tooth is
aboput 50pp 6/22 (same as Silvery war axe) +3str +6sta apart from that
Icetooth claws are getting cheaper all the time (1hs primary only) 11/29
down to about 200pp I have seen them for 100pp a couple of times on
Bristlebane.
Crystal fibre whip, already meantioned is a good choice. I have also seen
bezerker swords of 100 and less (12/36)
