I'm saying that to deal with content "balanced around slow", you can instead
overbalance a group.  All that means is that if you group had a shaman they
could go someplace twice as hard.  =P

However, the month after PoP came out, you weren't doing PoE without a
slower.  You're just to the point where you can trivialize content with
group composition.

I'm to the point where I can tank PoE mobs (even without slow in an
emergency).  This doesn't make monks good tanks.  It just means that my
equipment level has gotten to the point where I'm starting to trivialize
that content.

As far as a mage pet tanking.  It can be done "with proper healing" now.  Of
course, "proper healing" would qualify as insanely overwhelming if you had a
warrior tanking the same mob.  =) Anything can tank "with proper healing" if
they have enough hitpoints to live through one round of combat, something I
proved by tanking a (then "hard") raid mob the week after the monk nerf with
a battery of healers keeping me up.
