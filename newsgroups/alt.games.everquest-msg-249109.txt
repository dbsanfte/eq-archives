	I'm not that casual and am hardly crowing.  Dare  I suggest
to one of your stature that toning down the pompousity might result in a 
more productive exchange?

	Post hoc ergo propter hoc, eh?  That's bad logic even when applied to
fantasy worlds.  Membership might have increased even more had transport
features been included in earlier revisions.  You're making assumptions
with insufficient data.

	Frankly, I look at POK transport the same way I look at the revamped
tradeskill interface or the new  HP regen:  its not the dreaded Instant
Gratification but rather just a way to avoid spending time doing nothing.
That's especially important to us "casual" players who don't have the extra
hour to spend immersed in the realism of running across 4 zones.

	Between you and me I find getting stuck in walls and crashing
out of the game much more disruptive of any necessary suspension of disbelief
than I do the POK books.

	If you're willing to accept the reality of running a bipedal
cat-person who was born on the moon through the tree city of the wood elves 
it seems a small stretch to accept that touching a portal stone might magically
transport you.  You seem to be mourning  a removal of empty space from
the environment, space that forced people to interact out of sheer boredom
if nothing else.  I submit that that space is still there,: forming LDON
groups and raids, looking for  KEI in POK, chatting while working on
pottery...  As always it's up to the people to make use of it, and I
honestly think it's as easy to talk when you're sitting at the Everfrost
LDON camp as when you're waiting for some silly boat.

	Your blatant One True Wayism is both illogical and distasteful.
