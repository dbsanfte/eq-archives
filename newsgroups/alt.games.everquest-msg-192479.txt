Try this...

   1. Run TestEverquest.exe
   2. Do NOT hit play
   3. Exit TestEverquest.exe
   4. Go to your Evequest folder and copy EQMAIN.DLL to another folder
      (this DLL is dated 04/10/03)
   5. Run Everquest.exe
   6. When the patcher finished (and before selecting Play), copy
      the EQMAIN.DLL file you saved off to your Everquest folder,
      replacing the EQMAIN.DLL file in there.
   7. Now, click Play.
   8. After logging in, go to Chat, NOT "Enter Everquest" or whatever
      it says.
   9. From the Chat screen, click Play.

This has been working for me for the last day or so.
