I would not trust that.  Do it yourself, it's MUCH more gratifying.
 Besides - how do you know he won't take your account, and your money and
disappear?

He could loot your characters dry,  get your account banned (and Verant
would probably say that YOU violated the TOS by allowing him access) and you
would be SOL.

Take the extra time.  you'll be MUCH more satisfied.

IF you want 10 levels quickly, get a regular group, get over to Lake of Ill
Omen and hunt the sarnak fort.  with a GOOD group, you will have MINIMAL
downtime, and if you get a GOOD puller - you will have constant fighting.
You can get a level a day - 1 hour per yellow bubble.

Of course at 29+ you'll want to hit Frontier Mountains and get in a Giant
Fort group. then BANG a level a night - except for 30.
