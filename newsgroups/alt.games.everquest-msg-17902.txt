grrrr...I am so glad to be done with the 4th coldain prayer shawl quest...
you want to hear something funny about this? I get myself killed by the
Kromriff Death Squad, while trying to spawn Tanik Greskil for the quest.
I'd been trying for days, and would either get nothing at all, or the KDS.

I get my high level cleric friend (in game father) to come to EW to give me
a rez outside Kael.  as he's running towards me, he triggers Tanik. so I
complete my quest, get my rez, and all is well again.
