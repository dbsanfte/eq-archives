Yup they are - once beat your army when it was the best and most experienced
army in Europe. Never underestimate a seemingly inferior enemy. ( Go read
about the Nam if you want to learn aobut that). Armed storm troopers
nationwide. Well keep watching those movies.

Now what was it Mao said " Poer comes from the barrel of a gun." I have to
ask why your govt cannot trust with a gun when the old Kings used to require
you to go the butts every Sunday and practice with yur longbow. Indeed, you
were the fear of all Europe then. Tsk Tsk.

Ah he is a dumb fuck because he disagree with you are he is an American.
Love it There is still hope for the land of my Ancestors. Keep that attitude
and you may rule again. Oh millions? Learn to count. More people were killed
in European wars in the last century than in the US in the last three
centuries. Peaceful lot are you not?

They taste good, so does squirrel gumbo and venison. You of course would not
know. Ah but then, to be honest, there is a cultural difference here. You
see we have no concept of the King's forest and the King's deer. Everyman
was free to hunt. Basically you regard guns as playthings of the nobility
where we regard them as everyday items, both for defense and hunting. It is
really a very great difference. Which means we are quite a bit freer than
you to own them and use them.

Tsk Tsk Our American African Americans are nobody to fool with. They would
wallop you in nothing flat. No it would not be a wise idea to start shooting
at them. In fact an Afirican American friend of mine is a member of my rifle
club. You really need to quit watching Hollywood movies. Hey but keep
believing we are "Rambo." Ah but then you think if we own a gun we must all
be members of the Aryan brotherhood dont you? Not very bright of you.

Pool? - more kids drown in buckets of water in the US than are killed by
guns.

What is with you and the Taliban? Why are you so symaptico with people who
were responsible for one of the most repressive regimes in history and will
dance in the street when they kill you? As far as Afghans no one was
targeting them. True there were some tragic casualties but unfortunately
that is true of every war. Does the name " Dresden" ring a bell with you?

Nope. They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. ( I assume we are
talking about the non- combatants). And do not act so morally superior your
own  govt has done and will do the same thing.

Niether was pointless. You do not have much of grasp on current events much

Oh for goodness sake grow up. The world is not all sweetness and light. We
are talking about terroists here who murder women and children and hate the
west.  I suppose you think if you kiss them they will not kill you?

Well I do not know about him but I love British history. But then one of my
primary ancestors on my Mother's side was a Captain in the British  army and
came over here around 1640. And I do not think you need to apologize for
your history. But he is right, from your own comments, you shoe a vast
ignorance of the  USA.

Oh my Oh my those hateful devices  Oh my Oh my. Oh my goodness. Please Mr.
govt man protect me heaven forbid I might learn to do it for myself. Oh My
Oh my. And do you know what we need to take those hateful devices away from
our army . You sound just like a muddle headed socialist  liberal flower
child with love beads and no sense.Well you said it you did your
warmongering when you men were men in the last century.

I would rather be a Prick and a Dumbfuck than a weak willed and minded
scared of guns little puke like you.
