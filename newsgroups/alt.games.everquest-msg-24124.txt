Well let me tell you about something that happened yesterday to my
friends and I.  We were three, all just over lvl 20, fighting orcs in
Highpass and having a blast.  Spirits were high as wave after wave of
orcs fell, the corpses piling so deep we had to wade through them at
times to get to the next orc.  Then a lvl 31 scumbag came along.  First
he pulled groups of orcs on top of us for a while, but we just kept
mowing them down.  I didn't even realize he was higher lvl at this
point, I thought he was just a lower lvl char who didn't know any
better.  Then the named orc popped and he proceeded to interfere in our
fight in such a way that he not only stole the kill, but started a
series of events that got our druid killed.  When confronted with the
fact that he was a scumbag his response was "I wanted the pack."  So an
hour later when we finally got the druids corpse back after it had been
bugged we camped out.  In case you aren't catching this, the bastard
ruined the fun of 3 people simply because he was a greedy scumbag.  This
is why "Warrens rules" had to be created.

Oh and if you are that scumbag and are reading this... enjoy the
harvest, we may have been 3 lvl 20 somethings when you ran into us
yesterday, but we have many faces and will surely meet you again.
