Grr.. people who don't talk in groups.. That bothers me. I'm a chatty
person, and I love a pick-up group that chats along with me. Usually
irreverent, blasphemous, disrespectful, funny, sexual, silly, full of pun
and fun. I can understand people who don't like talk like that, they usually
don't say anything (or, worstcase scenario, leave) but a whole group of
people who are /gu chatting or chatting in /tell is a drag. I come on for
some conversation and company, and I get (heal-med-heal-med med med-heal)
and not much else.  :o(

but I LOVE

Getting 5 plat and more when looting a mob
Meming and trying out new spells
giving gifts and buffs to newbies who weren't expecting it
/guildchat
making friends that will give tells from across the world looking for me
Reviving someone who doesn't care about the experience, just to save them a
trip naked across 7 zones
going on training "raids" with my guild
