I don't disagree that the OP's post doesn't have merit.

I can probably explain my viewpoint best by demonstrating a few
theoretical outcomes:


Theoretical Outcome A
---------------------

1. OP rants.  It may or may not be without merit.  It may or may
   not be considered a whine.

2. AGE regular #1 flames.

3. AGE regular #2 flames.

4. AGE regular #3 flames.

...

100. AGE regular #x flames.

101. OP gets burned by the flames.  OP becomes defensive whether
     or not AGE regular #1 through #x had valid points embedded in
     their flames.

102. Huge flame war results.


Theoretical Outcome B
---------------------

1. OP rants.  It may or may not be without merit.  It may or may
   not be considered a whine.

2. AGE regular #1 -- who likely has also experienced frustration
   and fired off a rant at some point in his or her life -- responds
   respectfully and calmly.  Explains why they think OP is wrong and
   may want to re-think things.

3. AGE regular #2 wants to flame with something like, "You're scoring
   zero on my Do-I-Care-O-Meter," but decides that kind of immature
   and pointless baiting is beneath him/her, and doesn't do it.

4. AGE regular #3 has something to add to AGE regular #1's comments.
   Does so respectfully and calmly.

5. AGE regular #4 sees that regular #1 and regular #3 already made
   the point(s) he/she wants going to make, so doesn't bother to
   post.

6. AGE regular #5 wants to flame the OP with something like, "Don't
   let the door hit your ass on the way out," but decides to be
   mature instead, and not say anything.

7. OP responds to AGE regular #1 and AGE regular #3 with, "Hmmm, I
   didn't think of it that way.  Good point.  I was just frustrated
   and needed to rant.  Thanks for your responses."

8. Everyone goes home happy, and hopefully learns something.


Of course, the most likely outcome is:


Theoretical Outcome C
---------------------

1. I eventually give up telling people to behave like mature adults,
   and lose all hope for the human race ever trying to get along.

2. Theoretical Outcome A rules the planet.


That's not to say some people don't deserve to be flamed.  They do.
But it's so sad that so many people here immediately go into flame
mode.  As if *they've* never ranted in their lives.
