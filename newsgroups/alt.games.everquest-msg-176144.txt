Shhhhh..... I want some crystal chitin hand wraps - don't make 'em wake up
before I can scam^H^H^H^H earn some more cash...

I'm not sure the buyer completely controls prices in the bazaar.  There
seems to be a bit of boom-and-bust going on as well.  That is, I farm some
spiderling silks and sell 'em for absurd prices.  I buy cool stuffs - "hey,
Gnardo - where'd you get the lammys?"  "Selling silks - 5pp each"  "Cool!"
That person runs off and farms spiders for a bit.  Wash, rinse, repeat.
Throw in the usual percentage of undercutters and eventually, you end up
with what's going on now - a handful of mules at the old prices, a few more
mules at undercutter prices and a bunch of casual traders at very low prices
(there were some below 1pp Monday).

 At 5pp each, I'll spend an hour or two killing spiderlings.  At 5g each,
it's just not worth it - I can make more cash (and have more fun) doing just
about anything else.  That's probably true for most of the others - I expect
to see the spiderling silk traders drop off over the next week.  As the
supply starts to dry up, hopefully the prices will start going back up...
