   I can't speak to the et al and all, but they have recent announced
that banks will be global rather than local.  Which I find encouraging,
it seems to me that they might have some of their people already really
playing the game, and they let the devs know that local banks were as
much of a PITA as they sound.  One would hope they are doing the same
with other issues that might serve no real purpose other than to be
annoying.
