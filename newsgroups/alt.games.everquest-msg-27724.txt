I'm also asking tech support, but this group has been right on the money so
far.  Got a new computer (1.3Ghz P4, 128 MB RAM, 64 MB Radeon video card,
Win98 SE) and all of a sudden I get jerky video and combat becomes nearly a
slide show!  My old computer was FAR better at running EQ with far fewer
resources.  My sound is also wonky, with some sounds incredibly loud and
others almost inaudible.  The system has an SBLive! sound card, but EQ tech
support tells me that the long bemoaned "SBLive bug" only involves Win Me or
2k.  Any suggestions?
