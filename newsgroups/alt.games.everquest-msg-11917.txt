Even at that rate, he is not going to kill 12 (and wound another 4) in 15
secs.

I said I was not an expert, I didn't say I was a complete novice.

I have fired a Chinese SKK (on semi-auto) and I have fired a Lee-Enfield
.303. From my experience it was much quicker to fire 20 rounds from the SKK
than the .303, and I don't believe anyone could fire the bolt-action quicker
than I could empty that SKK magazine.

I'll tell you what I was implying.

I don't think that the problem the US has with gun related deaths has all
that much to do with the amount of guns in circulation. Israel and
Switzerland have higher rates of gun ownership, but they don't have the same
amount of deaths per capita. I don't really know why that is, but it would
seem that preventing gun ownership would not accomplish much.

I don't know what the ban has accomplished here. A lot of people I know
simply used the money they got from the semi-autos and bought brand new
guns. There is a difference between Australia and the US though, and that is
the death rate from guns.

Yes, I did say that. I was referring to a firearm.

Had Martin Bryant thrown a bomb into the Broad Arrow cafe or set light to
it, I doubt very much he would have been able to kill 35 people in 90 secs.
There weren't 35 people in there. Unless of course he reloaded his bomb and
chased the people outside.

You did say Australia didn't you? These all seem to be from the US.

I don't see this in the same vein as the other two. After all, they don't

I don't deny that these caught me by surprise, though I do seem to recall
the name, Buford Furrow.

I can only see this as a red herring. You are comparing a total of two
deaths by this method to how many from school shootings?  It's just not in
the same league.

And although it is no consolation to the families of the two kids who died,
I would say that the families of those children that survived were much
happier that he had used the method he did, rather than go crazy with an
M-16.

This reinforces my opinion rather than changes it. If these nuts had been
serious about killing a lot of people (children) they would have taken to
them with a gun, not a car.

Have you seen what the headlines were on 19th May 1927, the day after the
Bath Consolidated School bomb went off. Are you saying it got no media
coverage?

I think they go on shooting sprees for a lot of reasons, and I believe that
the more firepower they have, the more likely they are to succeed in killing
more people.

Sounds like he would have liked to though, doesn't it?

"Initially he said he said he thought about strangling someone who was
unfriendly to him, but then his thoughts turned to ``shooting them''. Mr
Bryant said ``I thought guns would be better, the more power, the better''.
Mr Bryant at this point began to talk about his various guns, in particular,
a machine gun which he took to be repaired in March or February. I asked him
whether he had intended to use this weapon, but he informed me that this
type of gun is ``too unstable''. He happily discussed the virtues of various
semi-automatic versus fully automatic guns."

You do realise this same argument goes for drugs, murder, robbery. Why
bother to outlaw these offences, we are never going to stop them.

Should we make chemical and biological weapons freely available? If not,
where exactly do we draw the line?

I don't see what you are getting at here. First of all, I have no interest
in whether the US bans guns or not. Secondly, are you suggesting that if
they did, this would somehow increase atrocities such as the ones you
mention?

The Bath Consolidate School bombing happened 75 years ago, so maybe once
every century isn't too bad.

You have gone off on a strange rant here.

Serial murderers are not "instead of", they are "as well as". Whether they
ban guns or not, you will still have serial killers.

Maybe you should find out a bit more about serial killers. They do not "stem
from the same twisted psyche as mass murderers", which is the precise reason
the distinction was made between the two. There are major differences
between the two

There are some absolutely crazy gun fanatics out there, who derive some form
of power from constantly stroking their guns. Some of them feel that if
their precious little toys get taken away they will no longer be men, and
the world will come to an end.

I'm not one of those, and neither am I a rabid anti-gun proponent.
