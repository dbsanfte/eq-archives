Ok nothing toward that post but thats a bunch of crap. If you can quad do it
in CS at like 54-55 if your a druid so you can work up AA points to get umm
mana regen and all the other BS stuff. If you wait till 60 the stuff thats
dark blue at the lower levels will give u so little xp it wont be worth your
time
