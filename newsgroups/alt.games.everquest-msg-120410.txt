Last night my guild decides to try something different. We have a
decent sized raiding force (for a change). So we decide to test our
might against Lendiniara the Keeper, the quest-giver in the west wing
of ToV. We pull her guards; they drop like so much wet cheese. We
challenge the mighty dragon herself, and she is found wanting.
Trackers say Gozzrem is up, We grin evilly. Gozzrem goes down.

We are all extremely pleased. The move away from CoV faction is
happening soon so the CoV hits aren't that important. The guild leader
says we will do Vindi & Statue to boost faction for those who need to
complete quests or hand in armor.

Dozekar is up in the east wing. We move to the entrance and buff up.
The first entry mob is pulled and goes down easily. And then
everything goes to pieces.

Someone coth'd an invitee who was KOS to CoV (this should only be done
when we're in the pit). The door to HoT gets opened and mobs pour in.
The guild leader screamed "CAMP!". I grin and click Exodus. My group
instantly ports to the zone-in area.

We begin rezzing. A cleric announces she is unable to rez one of our
wizards. Then another. And another. The other clerics try. None of
them can rez the dead wizards.

Petitions fly as the players camp out to hopefully fix this bug. That
makes it worse. Some of them cannot log in and resort to using alts to
find out what was going on. One wizard actually logs in but cannot
read guildchat, does not show up on /who and cannot be sent a tell.
She talks to us through the raid channel.

The guides online tell us at first that it was because we were
misusing familiars (?!).  One guide says the wizards may lose their
bodies. They can do nothing to help and try unsuccessfully to get a GM
to log in.

We find out Tormax is up and uncontested. We had the force to at least
try him, but with no wizards (gbane wizards at that) our raid was
effectively dead in the water.

Fingers crossed our players will get their corpses back. This is the
worst EQ bug I have ever seen.
