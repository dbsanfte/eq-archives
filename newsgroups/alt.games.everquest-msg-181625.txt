    Actually, some of the best gay jokes I've ever seen were made by an
actual gay person...

    Yes, a well reasoned argument if ever I saw one. You're absolutely right
on the mark, I'm being a... jackass? Or did I just make a joke that took
like *3* posts to explain to you, and you were so embarassed by that you had
to attack - attack being the only thing you know how to do, and used a very
lame platform of land rights for gay whales or whatever.

    You're my hero dork tyger.
