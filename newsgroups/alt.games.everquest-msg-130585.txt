I'm a lev 52 druid in a guild that has recently started being -able- to go
places such as Chardok, and such, and hold our own.  However, I'm one of
three port-capable characters in the entire guild, one we haven't seen in
quite a while, and the other is not on all that often...

So, as a result, I end up having to play taxi.  This is not something I
mind...  As long as I gather them up -before- the event, and then, after we
all decide to take off, dropping them off at the place of their choosing...
However, it rarely happens as clean-cut as this.  I end up having to leave
the fun, to gather a late-comer, or leave the fun, to take someone back who
decided he needs to camp for the night.

I end up spending less than 50% of my time at an event actually doing
something FUN, and either porting someone out, then dragging myself all the
way back to where everyone else is, or porting to pick someone up, and play
escort.  Of course, I'll miss out on the fun, any no-drop items that drop,
well, I'm just plain outta luck...  It's gotten so bad, I have come ---><---
close to just pressing delete on the character selection screen...

Any of you out there having the same frustrations?
