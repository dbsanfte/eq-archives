Well while I think you are right on some issues, I'll politely
disagree with others here.

/agree. nothing to complain here

Warriors less so, but SKs and Paladins tend to do a good bit of damage
as MT. I don't know about "primary damage dealer", but it's definitley
significant.

I'm a little preplexed on this one. How do they help move quickly? By
cutting down on sitting on your butt and waiting for that HP bar, or
sitting there bandaging yourself. They save you TONS of time. When is
the last time you went somewhere marginally dangerous with a group
without a good healer? You will spend at least 50% of the time
sitting. Clerics help this a lot, and this is essential for LDON. I
have not yet successfully completed an LDON adventure without a
cleric, or two druids.

I'm never very impressed with arguments about semantics. "Mob control"
vs "Crowd control" ... whatever. Anyways, the ability to mez is
essential in LDON as far as I can tell. The mana buffs are essential
in case of wipes, because usually it's faster to complete the
adventure and rez afterwards (of course more so for casters like
myself than say melees).

Again semantics. Reading it I immediately thought they were talking
about succor to zone safe point (entrance for LDON). This is often
times very useful on unmanageable overpulls, because running from the
dungeon entrance back to where you were fighting with no re-pops is a
minnimal downtime compared to a wipe. A good damage shield on the MT
will contribute significantly over time. Even a 10 point DS will add
up over time.

Sigh. More semantics (you can't port "from" somewhere without porting
"to" somewhere). Wizards can contribute a lot to damage, and also
(often overlooked) can root and snare. Very useful. (Disclaimer: Yes,
my main is a wiz) Anyway I don't see with what you're disagreeing
here.

Haste is not a buff? Debuffs are very useful on boss type mobs.
Shamans are like a utility class I think. They buff everybody and
contribute some DPS. Wouldn't be my first choice for a group mate in
LDON, but I wouldn't turn them down either. Oh and their heals are
good enough for someone like me who has little HP, keeping the cleric
or main healer(s) focused on the MT.

/agree on the chests. Horrible loot for the risk. /agree on the DPS of
rogues too.
