Ok, Decided to do Giant Faction. BUT I spent 1 evening hunting in Skyshrine.

Guessing I killed 40 low level mobs in Skyshrine. and someplace approaching
400 giants now.
but I am still "scowling ready to attack" in Skyshrine.

Is killing giants going to reverse this and if so does anyone have an
education guess as to how many more?

Thanks in advance.

Rob

ps. email replies would be great its hard or me to check here.
