Are you sure you've been playing EQ2 :)

Two months? I had more than that in my first 12 hours of play. At level 
15 it only takes a few hours at most to get drops worth that much. I can 
make 70 silver in an hour by making spells and skills and bags and 
selling them.

 > Getting resources is a pain.
It can be. But I've not found a great deal of competition for nodes once 
I got out the newbie zones. You can always buy things instead of mining 
them yourself. I've not seen huge amounts for sale but there is usually 
something.

 > Why can't there be crafting stations in every town
Er, running back to the docks, clicking on the bell and going to your 
own zone takes about 60 seconds. Hardly a big deal.

 > In order to make anything, you have to make about 8 other items using
I've never seen anything that needs more than 2 other items to be made. 
And I have plenty of space. You *do* have bags don't you? Get the 10 
slot tour of antonica bag, plus a couple of other quests bags, then fill 
the rest with the best player made bags you can find/make.

This is a good thing.
I want tradeskills to be somewhat hard. If it was easy to make anything 
you wanted first time then the items would have no value.
