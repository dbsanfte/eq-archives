Personally, I finished my epic with the help of members of two of my old
guilds, and only one person from my new one. hmm...come to think of it,
that's an "old guild" too now, since it disbanded and I had to move yet
again.

I still help people I have known from all of my old guilds, and when they
are ready to move on I help them get into my current guild, or others I have
friends in. I don't think there is a single "uber" guild on my server that I
can't call at least 5 people * current and active friends * in, including
the one that left for maelin starpyre en masse. My "old guilds" had no
problem helping me with my epic and welcome me to any raids they are going
on (in fact, the biggest one usually has at least 5 or 6 people from various
end-game guilds accompanying most raids).

And this is a server where friendliness is NOT considered a play style.
