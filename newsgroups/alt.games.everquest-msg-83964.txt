I got Torins horn as a part trade in EC (I was feeling generous, ok?).
Apart from the stat bonuses (dex4 hp25) its doesnt seem to do anything(.
I dont seem to skill up brass instruments when Im using it, and it doesnt
seem to enhance my denons distruptive dischord at all, not even the bonus
for having a basic brass instrument equipped! Does anyone know anything
about this horn? Is it part of another quest? Did it get nerfed? Will
someone buy it off me for 200p I lost on this trade? ;)
