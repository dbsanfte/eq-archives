The new Luclin songs are there as well, and
there is a bard trainer. Songs + instruments +
trainer = a city bards need to visit. FYI, most
bard songs <40 level are available in Shar Val,
as well.

It depends upon what you have now. They are
better, somewhat more than slightly better, than
store bought., but if you have Drums of the
Beast or Lute of the Howler, than it wouldn't be
worth a trip. The combine drum seems to be a
little less effective than a Mistmoore drum, if
that helps any.

Once you have your invisibility song, the trip
is completely safe. Get a good map of Echo
Caverns and Fungus Grove, and off you go. The
traps in Echo are easily avoided, if you know
where they are, and nothing in Fungus sees
through invisibility.
I have a theory, it could be bunnies....
