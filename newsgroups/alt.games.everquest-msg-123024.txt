Your answer isn't taking class into consideration.  My druid was
soloing tizmaks at 24, while I had troubles with them in a bard/monk
duo at 26.  I'm not sure what a Soldier of Tunare is, guess is
either a warrior or a ranger... neither real solo engines.  Neither can
use your Fear Kite plan alone on Tizmaks, but the ranger could
use it on animals.  How your enchanter fear kites is beyond me,
AFAIK you have no snare?

Hunting off the bridge in EW would be a good spot for a ranger, there are
a lot of different animal mobs, and the only thing to really avoid would
be the snow griffins, who fly faster than SOW unless stripped of 5 buffs,
which a ranger isn't well equipped to do.  Sticking snare takes care
of this of course, but the griffs tend to resist snares often enough that
they aren't good consistent targets solo... on the other hand it should
be a very very simple matter to find a griffin partner for a ranger.

For a warrior, velious really isn't a happy solo hunting grounds.  All
velious mobs tend to hit hard for their level, so that without slows
or a healer, finding exp mobs that you can reliably kill on less than
half your HP is difficult.  A Solo warrior must be able to do this
so he can bind back up to half and be ready to go, sit on your butt
healing is monsterously inefficient use of time.
