If you have the Planes of Power (PoP) expansion, go to the Plane of Knowledge (PoK) by clicking on the book that's on a stand that
on the trail from the Dwarf city (Kaladim) to the Greater Faydark zone line.  It's not far down the trail from Kaladim, and it's on
your right.  Once in PoK, you can find and click on the stone marked Freeport (click on the map icon in your toolbar to find the
right stone).  That will take you straight to Freeport with the hassle of the boat.

If you don't have the PoP expansion, or really want to take a boat, take the large sailing ship that comes to the dock on the right
about every 15 minutes, and just stay on it.  Do not take the flat-topped boats that are at the left dock - they go to a Kunark
zone. After the sailing ship zones into the Ocean of Tears, it will sit for approximately 1.5-2 minutes, giving sufficient time for
all the characters who were on the boat to zone.  Some people on older machines or who have really slow connections need that extra
time.  The boat will take a long trip through the Ocean of Tears, stopping at an island or two (don't get off the boat on these
islands!), and then eventually zone into East Freeport.  You can get off once the boat stops at the dock.

A word of caution: the boats are really bug-ridden.  Many patches have broken them and people dying on the boats due to link death
during zoning, falling for 20,000 points of damage, falling off, etc. because of screw ups in EQ's code are a fairly common
occurrence.  So, use the PoP stones if you can, and if you can't, when you board the boat, go to the center of it, not near any
mast, and just sit down for the whole trip.  It's reasonably safe if you do that.
