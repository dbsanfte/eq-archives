My druid has used it occasionally, though she mostly stopped once
she got SoE a level later.  But she's my tradeskiller, so sometimes
I'm spending a long time running around in the bazaar and/or PoK,
or on the ship in Abysmal.  Since I know I'm not going to be porting
anywhere or fighting anything for a while, I take the extra speed.
But yes, it's pretty rare, because even the hassle of recasting it
if I decide I have to port/gate between two non-combat locations is
more trouble than it's worth for the extra, what, 10-13% run speed?

I could have seen it being used more on Combine, where you folks are
actually running across multiple zones on a regular basis, but only
if the caster is coming with you to recast as needed, and to cast a
different run buff when you arrive.  I figured that's why Scale is a
group buff, after all.  But I'm not too surprised that it's disdained
there also.
