I'm still in the level range of the Aug / Alac debate.  Sometimes, I ask 
the group members which they prefer, sometimes I Aug the Main Tank and Alac 
the others, sometimes I Alac everyone.  I just judge it based on my average 
mana availability and any preference they have voiced.  If I can't handle 
the mana drain of what they want, I explain it and they are good with it.

I used to try to explain the benefits of the 2 spells to different people, 
but I don't waste the typing time, anymore.  I do what I think is best and 
try to accommodate them if they have a preferance.

That's a lot more then I do, but I tend to play in zones that require a lot 
of mezzing and mana consumption so I don't have a ton of extra time.  I 
don't think I have ever even cast Ultravision before.  I use GoM when I 
have the mana.  Clarity is a given.  Sym Aura if someone else really wants 
it, but I'm usually the one dealing with adds.  Obscure on some people.  I 
will Rune III the casters here and there.  *shrug*  I don't follow a self-
made script, I just do what feels right in that situation.

What is the name of these spells?  I have some spells from Luclin, but 
haven't looked them up, yet - been playing my warrior most of the time.

It is a rare case where I have AOE mez loaded, so I don't have a hotkey set 
up for it.  In the rare instance that I know I am going to need it, I just 
start casting and type: /g AOE MEZ  ... usually followed by: /g Shit, 
mezzed myself again.

The only looting logic that makes sense to me anymore is masterloot, except 
at low levels, where I usually don't participate in looting except maybe a 
FS weapon or something.
