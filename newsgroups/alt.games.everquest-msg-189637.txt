Pet's damage is counted to it's master's damage. Only point is that if none
of your group does damage to it mob the exp is cut in half.

I doubt what you saw was due to the pet. My guess is that you used a
damageshield, which damage is counted as "environmental" and does not count
towards anyone's damage. If the cleric did more then damage then the SK +
pet then he got the exp, any DS damage must be substracted first though (so
if the SK's DS did 20%, SK did 30%, his pet 5% and your cleric 45% the
cleric still gets it).

I'm a mage and if my pet stole my exp I probably would never have leveled
beyond 20 or so :).
