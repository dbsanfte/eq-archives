I can almost always take yellow solos and have a few times taken out a
mob 3 levels above mine. As for group encounters, it depends on the
arrows, but I can usually solo all greens regardless of up arrows, and
blue single up arrows ok too... Again it depends on the mob. If I can
keep the mob's attention on my summon for awhile and whittle down its
HP some before I start nuking it, that helps alot. Being a summoner,
if I run out of MP me and my summon can still melee the mob but I have
no way of replenishing the HP alone :(

A major complaint I have is that sometimes I'll be doing a quest that
has no need for me to group, then all of a sudden I'm tasked with
taking down a mob that is IMPOSSIBLE to solo. Then, I have to spam
/ooc or /shout to see if anyone wants to party up for 5 minutes,
sometimes without luck. Often you spend more time grouping up than you
do actually completing the objective if you can find anyone to begin
with.

I like group shared xp debts, because it keeps those clerics
interested in doing their jobs :) The shared penalty isn't big,
probably like 2% or so, but enough for you to care about your group
member's well being. Much better cooperation in EQII than other MMORPG
groups.
