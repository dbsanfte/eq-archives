Don't sweat it. INT casters (Wiz, Mag, Nec, Ench) do NOT rely on AC
(armor class) to survive. Even if you added 100AC to your Wiz he would
still get beat down if a mob decides to eat him (and you couldn't
root, gate, or otherwise escape). You are already past the INT "melee"
levels (1-10), which is the only time low AGI would cause you
problems.
