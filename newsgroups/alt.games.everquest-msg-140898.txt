Petitions stay in queue a LOT longer now since the new UI. (12 hours,
I think) My guess on what happened is the monk sent the petition that
he threatened, the GM/Guide who finally got the petition popped over
to watch what was going on (since they can't warn for KSing unless
they catch someone in the act of KSing), and saw that your monk
"friend" was the real offender...
