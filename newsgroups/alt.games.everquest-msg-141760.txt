You will need to do the Headband quests in Qeynos and the Sash quests in W
FP, for the Robe of Lost Circle which is part of the Monks Epic. Raster is a
bit of a pain to get but some great exp in Lower Guk Live side, Targin the
Rock is easy to get just go to the Kings room in Sol B and FD and ask the
the group camping if you can loot it when he pops. I had the Robe at 25 but
had some major help with Raster. If you are Iksar you will need to do some
serious faction work or Kill Brother Z or Brother Q to get the Robe.
