Well, I can see WHY.

I mean, imagine being a newbie, going outside the Freeport gates to hunt 
snakes, and

BAM

YOU have been hit for 300 points damage.
YOU have been killed by an uber l33t level 50 bat.  
Loading, please wait...


OTOH, it'd be kinda fun to play "pain and suffering", or maybe (if what I 
heard is true, which I don't THINK it could be, but...) be a mob that 
wanders under the Karanas telling you your medical difficulties. :)

"You have stubbed your toe."
"You feel a strange itching sensation in your lower extremities."
"Your head falls off and lands at your ruby slipper-clad feet."
