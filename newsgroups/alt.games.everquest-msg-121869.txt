You're gonna need to do what you have to to get comfortable in Dawnshroud.
I honestly have never seen as fast exp as it is there - and the place is a
Druid's wet dream.  The majority of the wolves will not aggro you save the
named ones (a silvery wolf, a glade wolf etc) and the lightcrawlers are a
pushover anyway if you get one added.  I will tell you myself and other
friends of mine have brought druids up to the mid 50's (rockhoppers mainly
at the end) from 40+.  All in DP.  The only thing that makes it huntable for
me is turning clipping down all the way and then back up 3 clicks.  That and
turn off the grasses if you're having bad lag there.

Great zone, city near by - faction permitting (which our druids have had no
probs with in Sanctus Seru whatsoever) , and several other cool zones right
off of that.  Bind at the SS zone and you'll be good to go in case of
trouble.  Nexus is a straight run 2 zones over through a newb zone to you at
40ish , the Netherbian Lair.
