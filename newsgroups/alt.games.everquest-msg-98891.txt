If your modem is a "winmodem", and not a full hardware modem,
junk it and buy a real modem.

"Winmodems" are cheapo modems that don't have dedicated chips
for all the signal processing, they leech off the computer's
CPU to do a lot of processing.  The problem is, if anything
else is hogging a lot of the CPU cycles, the "modem" can't
keep up with all the incoming/outgoing data, and disconnects.

I'm almost certain this is your problem.

Another thing to check is whether you have any other software
running in the background before you run EQ.  I have freezeup
problems if I leave my Epson printer software up when I run
EQ, and my nephew gets similar problems if his MP3 server
isn't nuked before he runs EQ.  Virus-checking software is
always bad for this too.
