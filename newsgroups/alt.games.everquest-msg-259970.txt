The differences in goals and attitude make all mmorpgs different,
trying to claim they'll all play the same simply because they are all
mmorpgs is ignorant. EQ players play differently than UO players, who
play differently than DAoC players, who play differently from SB
players, who play differently from CoH players.

The fact is, Bob has actual playing evidence for his position, and you
don't. You are the one doing the "guessing", and on pretty flimsy
ground.
