Personally I think it begs the question, are you friends if you've
never had to rely on the other person for anything important?  I don't
mean a game, I mean like picking you up when your car breaks down, or
helping you build a deck, etc.

To me friends are people that you rely on and that rely on you to help
them through, what's that called?  Oh yeah, life.  Anyone else is an
acquaintance, at least to me.

Not that common courtesy should be thrown out, just when people talk
about all their "friends" from EQ I have to wonder if they've even
seen these people before, let alone helped or been helped by them.
