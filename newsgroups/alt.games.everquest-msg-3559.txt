Hmm, I started a mage last week.  On my level 8 fire pet I get a
message saying 'Your spell would not have taken hold" when I cast my
damage shield on him.  I wonder if you are incorrect or if some higher
level mage had DS him for me.

Given the rarity of higher mages in Crushbone, I'd say you might be
incorrect, at least in some levels.

BTW, low level mages are REALLY fun.  I havent twinked him with
armor/weapons but I did give him money to buy all his spells and 10
backpacks and some food, plus a little left over to buy up extra
stacks of bone chips and a few crush belts (about 200pp total).  He
should hit level 12 tonight in under 24 hours of play.  I think it
took my original wizzy about 3 times that length.
