Be the class you want to be. Don't listen to people that say <any class>
sucks.

All casters spend most of their time meditating while grouping--ocassionally
standing up to cast a spell. So what types of spells do you want to cast?

As a Druid I can tell you this is not true.

instead.

Sounds like you narrowed it down to a Cleric or Paladin. So the classic answer
is: do you want to sit back and watch the action (Cleric) or fight
face-to-face with the beasts (Paladin)? Do you want to focus your time/money
acquiring WIS items (Cleric) or armor and weapons (Paladin)?

Remeber too that Clerics and Paladins (as do Necromancers) have special powers
against the undead. So don't pass up any oppertunites to show off those
powers :-)
