yes i would agree.

in the early levels, forget yellows and kill easy blues. melee as much as
possible so that you get hit as much as possible. use lifetap to keep your
health up. you want defence maxxed as much as posible.

imo, i would leave yellows alone altogether throughout your solo career. yes
, we can kill them but its not worth the risk imo.
the extra xp u earn is proportional to the extra mana (and thus downtime)
you have to spend. so you get no benefit for a very much greater risk of
death.

have fun
