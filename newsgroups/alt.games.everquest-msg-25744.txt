Dan,

  Just FYI.  I know of atleast two guides (who's names or nick's will not be
disclosed) that did NOT have to sign NDA's.  Either electronically, verbally
or hand written.

  Though, those are only two.  Perhaps the server(s) they were/are assigned
have their procedures out of order.

  As for the "Are you still here?"  Please take notice of the ";p"  Usually
that indicates sticking ones tongue out at someone else, hence, in a
jokingly fashion.

  I have not suggested or insinuated that I am any more intelligent than the
next guy.  I believe all of you thinking otherwise need to look back and see
whom made the first unnecessary comment toward who.   I am simply stating
that I would rather NOT be considered a troll who is going to battle it out
with every message that may or may not be correct as for content/facts
within that message but rather become a CONTRIBUTOR.

  If my wishing to end my participation in this thread is in some way an
insinuation that I am more intelligent than the next... <shrug>  I honestly
dont know what to tell you or anyone else.
