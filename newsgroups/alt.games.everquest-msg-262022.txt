Yes, one of the officers in my guild had that happen to him. Only lost
2 levels though. However...

1.) The expansion was re-registered to him in less than 2 hours.
(Probably only took that long because of the number of people
effected.

2.) He has been told his levels will be restored to him. More than
likely by the time he logs in tonight.

3.) Despite the lackluster experience people seem to have with SoE
customer service, myself and most of my guild members have had nothing
but positive experiences with them. Yes they are slow, but they do
seem to get the problem fixed eventually.

I will site some examples.

a.) Myself, died in East Karanas in the canyon, apparently due to a
bug or lag, I'm not sure which. Body popped into the wall. Could not
find it, could not be summoned. GM came and fished it out for me.
(This was over a year ago, thankfully I haven't needed to petition for
anything more recently than that.) Took him 2 hours to get there, but
he did a 100% EXP rez on me when he got the body back.

b.) My Guild leader, he accidentally destroyed a bag with his epics in
it. GM rolled him back to before he did it. Did it over night, GL
logged back in the next day with his epics.

c.) A guildie, could not log in. Within 10 minutes CS had his ticket
closed and he could log in.

d.) A guild officer, he did the turn in for his epic a few days ago.
NPC ate it. Petitioned, got his stuff back within an hour.

I think the difference here is that the people in my guild are polite
and don't expect miracles. Most importantly we don't use phrases like
"grease up your ass" in our petitions. People seem to be more helpful
when you are reasonable with them.

I work on the other end of the phone (not for sony) so I know what
it's like to be in their shoes. Too many things to do and not enough
time to do them. And of course everyone wants their issue fixed
"yesterday if not sooner". Cut ï¿½em some slack, and things will go
smoother, they might even do your ticket before the person who made
his consisting almost exclusively of four letter words.
