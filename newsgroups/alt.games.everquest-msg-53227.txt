anyone have a hard time getting their spells?
I just reached lvl 9 and I'm reading on castersrealm that some are available
only at 'good' plaes that I can't go.

Is that true?

and if I can purchase some at Neriak (where i'm bound right now anyway) is
it safe for me to go to the 3rd gate area to buy them? I got slamed more
than once in the commons area by npcs that doin't like ogres, including npc
ogres!
