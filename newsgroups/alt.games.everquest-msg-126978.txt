My recent post asking about some mysterious items I had collected led me to
research the Twilight Sea armor quests.  Most of the items I looked at did
not seem to be very good for the level needed to obtain them.  Does this
seem to be the general consensus?  Are there any items worth going for?

I even checked a few items to see if I could equip an alt and the necro
weapon is a 2HB! What good is that?  It would keep me from being able to use
my offhand INT item that is +9 INT.

These items seem like they would be kick ass for levels 25-40 but at 45+
most people have much better.

What gives?
