I don't know for sure.  The latest theories I've heard suggest that 100% 
one way or the other is fine, and 50/50 is fine, but the odder splits may 
not be exactly right.  But I have no way of checking that... someone whose 
dog uses ShowEQ wanna enlighten us? :)

Heh.  I would do Run1 and maybe 2, then get to 65. :) Remember, if you get 
into PoP progresion at all, there are various points at which you will get 
a free AA, and some of those might happen before 65.  Why oh why would you 
waste AA on Sta??  Either regen 1, bandaid technology 1, or atkins diet 1 
would probably be better for ya. 

>3) If you have 1 AA in run (run1) you are slower than SOW, and however
>cannot use any SOW potions to boost speed.  Is this true?

Nope, not at all.  Faster buff takes precedence.  It's the cheap horse 
that snares you. :)
