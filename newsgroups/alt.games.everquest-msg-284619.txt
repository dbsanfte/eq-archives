You're right, WoW has to start declining at some point - the only question 
is when.

WoW has had 2 years of growth, whether it's peaked yet is hard to say.

With TBC coming out soon, that number is going to spike as a lot of
people who cancelled come back to check it out.

The plan, according to the top Blizzard people, is 1 expansion a year from
here on out. 

I think it will follow the same pattern as EQ - rise, peak, stable, drop, 
stable ..... (not sure what comes next).  Maybe its sheer numbers make 
each period a little longer than EQ's were, but it will still follow the
life cycle I think.

Given that EQ is approaching 8 years old (this March), and that it had 5.5
really solid, king of the hill type, years - I'm going to guess that WoW
has 6-7 really solid, #1 MMO years.  That gives it 4-5 more, enough time
for TBC and 3-4 more expansions to come out.
