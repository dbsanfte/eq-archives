They don't aggro mobs provided they're not engaged in battle with a
social mob within the aggro radius of another social mob.  Hence, if
you send your pet in to kill a kobold, the kobold next to the one
attacking will attack your pet the instant the first kobold aggroes. 
Your pet, however, can walk right over both of them without drawing
aggro.

They changed the pet aggro primarily because of bad pathing.  Before
that, if your pet decided to take a different route back to your
campsite following a kill, he'd end up aggroing everything along the
way and train the hell out of you.  Now he won't so long as he's just
"passing through".
