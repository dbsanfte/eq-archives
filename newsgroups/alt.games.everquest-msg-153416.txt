This reminds me of the firm where I used to work at where we had
Windows 3.11 machines a long, long time ago.  Apparantly it was a
sacking offence to remove or modify the screen savers in any way.  But
one of my tasks was to compile monthly all the data for the company
and this would involve a series of runs which would run unattended for
hours on end.

The problem was that when the screensaver kicked in the processing of
our task would stop.  So, to get around this we got one of those
desktop fans which oscillated from site to site.  If we were careful
we could wrap the mouse around the fan it would then be dragged over
the desk continually and thus prevented the screensaver from kicking
in.

We also tried to do something with one of those nodding bird water
drinkers but it was too messy and the pressure invoked from those
things was next to useless to do anything.
