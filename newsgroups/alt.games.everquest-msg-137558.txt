Yup, we were in Howling Stone/Charassis and just entered the south wing with
the help of a rogue.  We'd only been there once before...like a year
ago...and weren't prepared for the 5 critters that immediately hit us
(including a helot with ice comet).  Monk when down first, rogue second
while I was still working on mezzes.  Wizard asks about evac and I told her
NO (CR would have been a pain).  I had everything but one mezzed, and told
the ranger to stop hitting it, and mezzed it as well.

Meanwhile the wizard dies somehow, so now we're down to 3 people and 4
critters mezzed and me hovering between 5 & 20% mana, keeping everything
mezzed while the cleric can rez everyone, and the wizard can just evac us
back to the center (there was a hunting party at center).

I never told anyone how low my mana was until long after the incident...I
didn't want the cleric and ranger gating (potion on ranger). <g>
