> For my 34 ranger what would be a better combination: a skyfire (primary)
and
> a centi short OR centi longsword (primary) and centi short.

None of the above.
It's big, it's heavy, it's fat but it's still the best primary weapon,
it's... the wurmlayer. Yep, still the most effective primary weapon until
level 50.

And especially for rangers, you do NOT want agro in groups, so this will
make you deal an obscene amount of damage while flying under the radar.

For the offhand I'd suggest a centi shortsword or longsword, depending on
how much you have left. Also, try to get some stamina gear to get your
stamina to 100 and the weight of the wurmslayer will never affect you.
