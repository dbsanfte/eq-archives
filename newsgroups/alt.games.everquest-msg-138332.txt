Well my cleric donates 50 plat, for any porter who says they are
porting for donations. I figure donating 50 plat keeps their druid
from getting jaded like mine now is (at level 56) and no longer
porting even for 50 plat.

Which reminds me, I found the single best way to keep beggars from
bothering me with personal tells. I finally said to myself, "Screw
these little bastards in their mommy's basements, I'm not being anon
anymore!" Since that time I get quite a few, "Port to LS plz?" And
such. 

At first, I tried what you'd logically think would work. I mean, they
are asking me unbidden, I never invited query and I'm just minding my
own business.

"No"

The thing is, evidently not having anything close to resembling a
competent parent ever, they don't seem to understand that someone can
say "no." To them "No" is an invitation to start a dialogue.

"why not?"

So my new thing is to say what I think, as this poster does I guess,
is just the minimum charge for a port. So I say this:

"50 plat, in my hand upfront, before the port."

To that, I never get an argument. I always get something like.

"ok thnx 2 much." 

Like my cleric, if you really want to have porters continue to bother,
I'd give a minimum 50 plat. I'd give it to them before the port, as
soon as you approache them. You know they can port, I've never heard
of a case of a porter taking your money then going "HA HA!" and not
porting.

Its amazing to me that all these people begging me, unsolicited, for
favors then balk just because I say, "50 plat up front." They must
just expect because I'm a non anon druid that I'm saying,

"use me, then kick me to the curb.. oh and talk dirty to me baby."
