Fortunately for me, being a shaman, I had enough extra mana available to
sneak in the extra nuke or two I needed after I was oom.  Just had to Can a
few times, and I generally had regen going to help get those HP back.  I can
remember a number of times when kiting a mob, particularly giants, where I
ended the fight having not been touched by the mob, but oom, and at 10
percent hp.  I always tried to end that kind of fight somewhere near a zone,
as you never know when that one extra resist or fizzle will turn the fight
the wrong way.
