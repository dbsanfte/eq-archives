I have 2 accounts and I am trying to find simplier ways to play two
characters at the same time. I made basic keys to heal, dot, slow, etc
and I having problems trying to set up keys with the pause command on
the same line as another command. I've been told by several ppl in my
guild it can be done but it doesnt seem to work.

For Example if I wanted to heal with one keystroke it currently looks
something like this

/stand
/target Bob
/cast 1
/pause 40
/sit

If I wanted to cast several buffs at the same time I have tried
several things that don't work

/stand 
/target Bob
/cast 1 /pause 40  or /cast , /pause 40
etc

It doesnt work. How can I use a pause command on the same line or can
I?

If a pause command can be used on the same line can I also add another
cast on the same line? Such as:

/cast 1 /pause 40 /cast 2 /pause 40

Any FAQ's or websites out there for macros?

Thanks
