One of the best spots in FV is way up north east, near the swamp zone.
There's a forest giant camp up there with 3 or 4 giants.  Used to go
up there with 1-3 guildies, near the giants (leave them alone, you can
kill 'em, but too much bother and they be very non-aggro) and just
smack around the frogs and dogs.  Just sit up on the hill near the
giant camp (iirc just a bit north of 'em).  Lot's of wanderers and
very steady slaughter.


There, now I've given away one of the guild's "Secret Sweet Spots" for
that level range...
