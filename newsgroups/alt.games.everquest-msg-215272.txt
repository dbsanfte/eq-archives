"Lost", eh? Sure he did, it's so very hard to find your way back to the
wayfarer's camp from these dungeons....Join the LDON channel on your server
and tell people the name of the asshole so we don't group with him. And ask
whether someone knows the way back before you agree to let them be main
looter...

Sheesh, you are having bad luck. You actually only have to be in the same
zone with the looter for splitting of cash, don't have to "keep up" with him
in the sense of running alongside him.
