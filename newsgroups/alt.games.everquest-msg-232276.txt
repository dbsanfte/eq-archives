It's pretty good work. I wish I had the focus and patience to make
myself practice. That's my problem, not that I don't have talent. ;p
I've got a friend here I met through my fiance who just makes me cry
when I see her work. Why she doesn't have a job doing art
professionally, I don't know. http://www.ladyofdragons.com/~lair/

You ever been by Norrath Studio? http://www.raenestorm.org/phpBB4ns/ I
lurk there a lot and do some screenshot manipulation from time to
time. My fiance's a little more active and usually does the art
exchanges they run regularly.
