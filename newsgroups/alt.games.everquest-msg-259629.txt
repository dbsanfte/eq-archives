The stress test beta phase of World of Warcraft started today. I got one of 
the 100,000 keys before they ran out and started playing this afternoon. 
Although I have some significant reservations about what I've seen so far 
(the NDA was lifted a while ago), still, it's a beta for one of the latest, 
state-of-the-art MMOG'a and I'm jazzed to be able to check it out, even if 
this phase of the beta lasts only 7 days. I brought a Tauren Shaman up to 
level 5 before the server crashed and got locked out. I came back on another 
server and brought a Dwarf Paladin up to level 5 before breaking for dinner. 
At this point I was starting to have some fun and I thought to myself: what 
am I gonna do at the end of 7 days when I'm all lathered up and the stress 
test comes to an end? Oh man, this was looking grim...

And then I checked my email and found an invitation to the *other* MMOG that 
I've been eagerly anticipating. Downloading the client now, and thinking to 
myself that this *couldn't* have been a coincidence, heh.
