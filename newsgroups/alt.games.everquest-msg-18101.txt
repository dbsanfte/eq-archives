Still doesn't make it right. Verant has changed many design things that
were stupid to begin with. Like removing the hybrid exp penalty, adding
more places to bind, and recently taking away the dungeon restriction
on the Kunark Evac spells.

Same for me. Verant has made changes to the game for the better
of it. This game is much much more fun to play now than it was when
it first came out. Why not keep making improvements?

I disagree. Its a penalty all right. But the spell book penalty is way too severe.
Being bored in a game that is supposed to be fun is just stupid.

Neither does pong. Your point?
Doom and Quake levels/maps are about 1/100th the size of a typical EQ zone.
