In a group, no, they aren't. Great xp too.

I am forced to wonder at which velious mobs you've been fighting. Yes,
thurgadin has generally fewer higher level residents...but on average, I'd
*much* rather kill giants in Kael or dragons in Skyshrine/Westwastes,
because you can CAST ON THEM. Course, that is skewed from the shaman point
of view, where my whole purpose is to summon a pet, do some buffs, and
heal...the *only* spell I can effectively cast on them is burst of
flame...and 5 damage does not kill them all that quickly.

Holding long enough for the group to get to it is hardly the same thing as
killing it :)
