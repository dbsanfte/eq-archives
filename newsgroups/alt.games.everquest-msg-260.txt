Actually for X-mas I gave EVERYONE an Everquest retail box!
Even though those were all shrinkwrapped I may have violated the TOS =
there too because I transferred the game to someone else as a gift.

That was about 10 EQ's I purchased =3D about $300 USD

Then since the girlfriend lives with me and I got tired of watching her =
die OVER AND OVER again - I spent an evening to get her a few levels.

My 9yr old was actually quite good and got to about level 5 on her own =
but she got bored with the monk and wanted a caster so I gave her a =
shaman.

Neither of the two have a credit card so it was up to me to cover their =
charges (lucky me) but at least now I will always have a group to join - =
I think next I will set up the voice controls for both of them - I will =
stick to my optical mouse and keyboard.

I was kinda wondering what others thought - and do I have to call all 10 =
of those people and say "DONT PLAY THAT GAME - I was wrong to buy it for =
a christmas gift" ??

Hmmm

    I AM GUILTY -=20

    What about the girlfriend who refused to play unless I made it =

    Does that mean I am evil?!??
