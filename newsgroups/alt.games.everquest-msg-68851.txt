	Kael was pretty much fixed in that regard; you can only bind at the zone
line now.

	No, I don't, because no one puts a Druid or Wizard into their group just
because of their ability to teleport, and the Druids and Wizards wouldn't like
it if they did.  My ability to Track is an asset to my group, as it improves
our ability to pull, and giving that to other classes does diminish my ability
to leverage it into pickup spots.

	We have those on E'ci too, but I sincerely doubt there are enough of them
to make a difference one way or another.  I certainly don't think protecting
the privledge of a few to milk players with more platinum than brains is
something to consider.
