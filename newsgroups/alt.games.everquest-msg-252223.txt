I think it was regarding Lineage, but, actually occured in China, not 
that it is important to this discussion.

If, in an American court, virtual property in an MMORPG were to be ruled 
to be considered property of the player, then, fraud could occur.  It is 
something that, to the best of my knowledge, is as of yet, untested in 
American courts.
