    There are items that turn clerics from mediocre soloists into efficient
soloists which aren't available to an enchanter. Give me a manastone, a
Faith Stone, a Prelate's Rubicite Helm (saw one last night for 6 K, but I'm
a team player) and a Hammer of the Sun and I'll solo better than you'd ever
imagine. Free right-click DoT, Root, and the ability to travel back to the
old world and manastone back to full in seconds? Yowza!
