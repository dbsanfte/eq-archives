Do you have ANYTHING to offer besides silly accusations of everyone
but you being a "pre-pubescent"?

So far you've been owned so badly by everyone in this thread it would
be a disservice to plonk you - stupidity on your level is too rare to
ignore.

Still waiting for you to admit that most the newsgroups you posted
actually bottompost, and those people in them that don't appear to be
as clueless as you are.
