I and my friends have an argument regarding what race makes the best shaman
AT LEVEL 65..

Looking at few Magelo stats it seems like:

ogre +180HP advantage, frog +100 mana

but then stamina comes into effect and it seems the ogre has an advantage
there.. any comments?. At level 65 what is the ratio of stamina-hp
conversion.

Lizard has regen going for it, but low stats for both HP and Mana. I dont
know what the barbarian advantage is, but they seem to be popular
characters for shaman.
