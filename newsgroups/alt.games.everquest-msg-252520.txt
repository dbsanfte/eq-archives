1) Clear all of the other mobs in the room first if possible, if you can't
or don't you'll just need to be more careful.
2) Have Sow or Run5 , Run3/Jboots will work but it will take longer and
there is less from for error
3) If possible have extended range and affliction haste items
4) Pull with Saryrn's Kiss (This is the only time you will get to cast this
spell) at max range
5) Kite from corner to corner Diagonally, applying dots as you can, You
should be able to get off Funeral Pyre and Blood of Thule at the very least.
Your pet will not add much to the fight unless he has SOW
