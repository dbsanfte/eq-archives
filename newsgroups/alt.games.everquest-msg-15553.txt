Dwarf Heads can be aqquired right out side Thurgadin and if you are Brave
you can get them inside Thurgadin also. I have gotten about thirty or so
hunting dwarfs between the Wurm cave and the entrance to Thurgadin you do
have to be careful where you pull and fight for some unknown reason their
friends like to help out and Nobody wants to ruin faction to help you out.
