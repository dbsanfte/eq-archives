Yep, I'm stuck too.  Before I got booted there was an in-game announcement 
that "we're looking into the lag, please don't petition".
Of course, if you go to the EQ site and check net status,
the last message is Wednesday's "All servers are up".....

My wife's been having a little better luck in checking it
out, apparently Tunare has about 30 people on it right now :)
Not much trouble getting a camp if you can stay on.
