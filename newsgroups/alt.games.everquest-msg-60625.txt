Sneak works only occasionally.  The only way to know if it's working is if
you start running a lot slower.

J Clancy mentioned the main benefit...dealing with vendors who wouldn't
normally sell to you.  It works for KOS vendors as well but I wouldn't
really count on it.

The other purpose, used even less, is to sneak to the side or behind a KOS
critter that you'd rather simply avoid if you can help it.
