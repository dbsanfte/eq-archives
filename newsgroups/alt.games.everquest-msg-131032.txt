SSoY or Yak is 8/24 1hs proc Ykesha (75dd)
Jagged Blade 13/25 as mentioned
Large Dragonbone Shard 13/26

The SSoY is faster but the Ratio of the other 2 make them better options
(faster is only good if the ratio is close and the damage bonus will make up
the difference, in both cases here the answer is no) also, the Yak's proc is
not something you can rely on, you might get 5 in one fight but you will
often find you get none as well.

Jagged Blade of Mourning in primary, Dragonbone shard in secondary is the
way I'd go.
