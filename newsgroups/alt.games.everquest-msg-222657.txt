<snip reasonable comments about pulling>

re: pulling. for groups you are probably pretty much right for the most 
part. For the solo player the ability to F8 target it is woefully 
inadequate... and I'd say 90%+ of players solo from time to time, and F8 
just isn't really adequate.

Every time you upgrade gear or 'move' 'use from inventory items' you 
need a new hotkey or if you keep a clicky item in a bag you will still 
need the mouse. But I gave you 'half a point' because its admittedly a 
'setup with mouse and use kb afterwards' except for the bagged gear example.

I'm going to have to play with that. I've lost too many corpses in walls 
to count.

Even so we're still just looking at the loot... we haven't actually 
taken any of it. /target mobs corpse, /loot ... and then we still have 
to grab the mouse...
