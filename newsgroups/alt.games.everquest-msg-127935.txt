Pffft, I wrote a util to parse the data files used in Final Fantasy
VII, just because. I had no idea how they were built, and the data
I was interested in was the MIDI music or the sound files, I forget
which. I did the same to the Full Throttle data files, too.

For me, the carrot was the music files stored in the master data
file, and I saw the task of untangling the data file format as a
fun challenge, made all the more fun by me not knowing jack about
the format in the first place. Geek, moi?
