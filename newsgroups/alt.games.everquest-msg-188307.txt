Funny you should ask, since it's about to be tested.  A friend just dinged 
20 on her enchanter.  New full name is, "Madamme Yboshi".

Of course, being insufficiently geeky, I had to get her to explain it. :)  
I've long thought the first name might count as a title as it is, though.  
I guess we'll see what happens :)
