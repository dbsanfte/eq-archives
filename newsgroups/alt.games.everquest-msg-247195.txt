I think my 61 Wizard would be able to solo him, unless he has abnormal
regen.  I remember testing him around 49, hitting him with one Ice Comet,
seeing from that how many HP he had (about 10k), and realizing that was more
than I could handle, so jbooted to the zone.  At 61, with a bigger mana
pool, and more efficient spells, he would be doable, I think.  Not going to
reactivate the account to find out, though.  (Although it is tempting...I do
have unfinished business in that general part of the world.  A named Treant
in NK annoyed me 30 levels ago, and I never did go back and show how I felt
about that.  My Gate cast faster than his nuke, so I survived, but he needs
to be made an example of).
