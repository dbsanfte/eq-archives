I just recently notice there is a difference between Armor AC and ability
AC. It started in Konors Castle with my 52 Monk AC is 1008 Buffed. He was
being hit very hard it seemed 51 Shaman and a 59 Cleric was backup. Being my
49 Oger Warrior was at castle outside I logged him on. Buffed his AC was 982
Several peices of Cobalt and Worked Dragon hide armor. He didn't seem to be
hit as hard as the Monk. As a test later that day we went to Fungus Grove
and pulled an Underbulk and fought the "Same" one with both characters the
Monk with the higher AC averaged taking 9 points more damage per hit then
the Warrior. I wrote down the first 25 hits of each to make this analysis.
This struck me as a bit strange any comments?
