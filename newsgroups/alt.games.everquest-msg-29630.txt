 Quickest solution? Go to Velious. Spend the next few levels camped in
Crystal Caverns. (get a bind in Thurgadin). There is a bank at the bottom
that you can use, and you can use sneak to utilize the vendors. Kill lots of
orcs, herbalist and named spawns especially. If you can find a group willing
to hunt geonids (they have a caster item quest associated with them...most
people don't want to mess with their faction) do so, they drop jewels (.1
stone) that can sell to vendors for upwards of 125pp. Get in a queen group
if you can.
   You're sure to get at least 1kpp worth of items, unless you get some
really bad rolls. You can easily sell/trade them for what you need.
 I started in CC at about 35...and it was when I finally broke the "plat
barrier" and had some money rolling in. I went in with cured silk and a
fighting baton (traded a forest loop for it at around 29. I also had a
foreman's vest that is a gift, and crescent slippers that I had been lucky
to get). By the time I spent a few levels in CC, I had another baton, Wu's,
an adamantite bo stick, a lockjaw hide vest several nice jewelery items
(some resists, and some HP) and an evil eye bag.
