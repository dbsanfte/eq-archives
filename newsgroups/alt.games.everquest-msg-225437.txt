I don't find "come to POJ" any ruder than  "want to join us for a 
dungeon?", in fact, I much prefer the former.  Its simple and 
informative.  A question mark would be nice, even though it would add a 
wee touch of Valley speech.  But the latter doesnt' ask me to join some 
unspecified group for some unspecified dungeon, a requesting a 
commitement before telling me what I'm committing to.

This is similar to "do me a favor?".  WHAT favor?  "No," is the answer 
I'm tempted to give to anything that open.  Instead I ask "what is it?".

Similarly "join us for a dungeon" without telling me -which- of the 
dozens of dungeons in the game they are talking about isn't very helpful.

Worse, "join us for a dungeon" most often comes from someone who's in 
Anon or Roleplay mode.  Now I have someone of no known level or class 
(not to mention race, for those with roleplaying aspersions) asking me 
to commit to something unspecified.

"Me and Enrique are planning a run into Permafrost, like to come along" 
would be a lot better than any of the above, assuming teller and Enrique 
aren't anon so I can peak at what they are talking about.
