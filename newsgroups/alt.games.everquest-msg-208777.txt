Until you are much higher level there really isn't squat available
to you that is "good", except for what you can buy.  That said,
your newbie quest weapon is likely to be usable for a few levels
at least, but as a melee expected to deal damage in a group you
really would be hurting yourself to refuse to shop for weapons in
the bazaar.  I can tell from what you posted that that's not the
RP you had in mind for the character, but unless you're intending
to solo all the time you owe it to your prospective groupmates to
be as reasonably equipped as you can manage (note that at level
10 this isn't that big a deal, only a jerk expects a true newbie
to be well geared at that low a level).  If you really want to
work for a weapon (actually a pair of them) research your epic
weapon quest and start collecting the fwe bits and pieces that
are already accessible to you.  You won't be able to complete the
quest for a long time, and you'll need substantial help along the
way, but at least the Ranger can still get real value out of his
epic so you wouldn't have to ignore the fact that it's a whole
lotta work for nothing like it is for some classes.
