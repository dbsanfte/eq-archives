Ah, but I didn't say it was positive or negative. But it *IS* a change
to the world that is permanent, isn't it? It's different than the same
old endless parade of wandering and static mobs that will keep popping,
time after time, for as long as you're willing to sit there and kill
them.

I'm not positive, having not done it, but wasn't that removed? I know
that text was in the script when Conquest got fucked out of existance,
but I seem to recall some folks posting the information on the more
recent wakenings where there was no longer a response in Sol B or in
Permafrost?

Well, in all fairness, having him purge the entire server of all dragons
for all time would put a bit of a damper on the end game, don't you
think?

I agree, and with your last point as well. If they are capable of doing
this script, then maybe a whole series of server evolving events like
this could be possible. I think it would improve the game 100%. And it
wouldn't even have to be at a *super* high level like that. On a virgin
server, there's no need for there to be *ANY* tier one boss mobs in the
game, because nobody's going to see them for a couple months at least. 
But I can picture many formerly newbie zones "evolving" to mid level and
then high level zones as guild strutures grow that can dominate the
starting content. As long as enough true newbie stuff remained behind
for all the players starting later, that would really improve the game
experience. Your idea is genius, and it could be expanded on in many
zones.

Why not? Just curious. Long before I got intot he fifties (and yes, I
know what level your main is) I felt the same way. But later on, talking
to more folks and thinking about it, I concluded it was just jealousy.
The Sleeper can only be killed once. So who should do it if not the
first guild who does the work to make it to that level of capability?
And are they to "trust" any guilds coming up after to *not* do it just
on their word? Plus, tier one guild life is VERY competitive for the big
spawn mobs. If you could cut off a supply of serious weaponry to your
competition after you'd secured it for yourself, wouldnt' you? My guild
will never get any of that stuff because we came to late. *shrug*.
Should have moved faster.

Agreed. See above. This would be an outstanding feedback to give to VI.
Not sure how tough it would be, or how eager they would be to do the leg
work to implement those kinds of improvements, but it would definitely
be great.
