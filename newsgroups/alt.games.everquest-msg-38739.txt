As it is, the 30 mins corpse timer for level 55+ mobs is often times
too little.

You just killed Vulak, it dropped three All/All items.  Each make
anything anyone has look like rusty shortswords.  You have 60 people
at the raid some are LDed, some are corpse bugged (if you've ever died
too close to a wall in ToV you know what I mean).

Decide who gets the 3 items in under 30 mins....

Blech.
