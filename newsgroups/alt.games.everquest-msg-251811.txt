It's actually for each slot number, rather than augment type. Slot One
Remover (not the actualy name) for augs in slot 1; 2 for 2; 3 for 3. Very
useful for those of us on Firiona Vie who may buy an item already augged
with something we want to replace, as well as upgrades. And useful for those
on the other servers who want to remove an aug to make the item sellable
again (it it wasn't nodrop to begin with).

Personally, I'll be glad when Sony comes out with the Aug Remover that
doesn't destroy the aug in the process...would be great to be able to resell
those old augs and get some kind of return on them. :)
