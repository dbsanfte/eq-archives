Hey I was just wondering if anyone knew if the strict melee classes are
getting anything from the PoP expation I mean . All the spell casters are
getting new spells what about us Monk's & Warrior's ? I haven't seen
anything for them in the expasion yet . I hope they bring something out for
us LOL . If anyone has heard of anything I'd love to hear it LOL .
