I don't believe that Lance said he would not pull at 80%, but rather that 
he would have the pulls work out such that overall, mana expenditure 
equalled mana regained.  The only difference I see is that you pull until 
mana is down in the 30ish range, then, you have to slow down pulls to 
keep mana stable, whereas Lances group would slow down at around 80, and 
keep mana around 80 instead of around 30.  This would mean that you kill 
a few more mobs up front, and that is all.  Alternatively, you zone into 
the dungeon sooner, at 30%, whereas Lance and his group wait for 80%, so 
they zone in a bit later.  Once zoned in, pull rate is the same, assuming 
people are using mana more or less the same.  The difference is you 
started a couple minutes earlier.

He would rather have the mana level hovering at plus or minus 80 to give 
a safety net for when the shit hits the fan, you don't seem to feel that 
is necessary.

I am reasonably certain that is what he is arguing anyway.
