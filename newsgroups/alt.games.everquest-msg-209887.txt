Hey everyone,

I have a quick question that I'm hoping someone can answer.

My guild took down Klandicar yesterday and I ended up with is
Talisman. When I went to go do the turn-in in DN to Jaled Dar's Shade,
he wasn't up. I checked back again today, and still nothing on track.
(Yesterday, I went with a rogue right into his room and he wasn't
there.)

Now, from what I've read, it is nearly impossible for him to be
killed, so does he despawn? And if ihe does (or was even miraculously
killed), does anyone have any idea what the timer is on him, or is
there a way to spawn him?

Any help would be appreciated!

Thanks!
