Way back in the day when EQ2 was first being previewed on the site they 
mentioned something to the effect of an inheritance system, where your 
character from EQ could "pass down" the equipment to the generations in EQ2. 
Yet since then I've seen no mention of this.  Is this something that was 
officially dropped?  Any rumors?  Any ideas?  Thanks.
