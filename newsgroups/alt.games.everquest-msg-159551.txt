if you want to farm, either a mage or a necro, maybe a shaman, but hands
down if you want a tradeskill enchanters are the best IMO because
1) they have a VERY good dexerity buff for smithing
2) they can enchant the metals for jewel crafting
3) they have wisdom/intelligence buffs
4) they have good charisma and faction altering spells to get good vendor
prices
