That's part of it, but you are ignoring part of the message.  Here's
what Verant said:

	Added "Recommended Level" equal to the current item use level 
	for the several items. All of these items require the player 
	to be level 51+ to equip them and/or use their effects. 
	Setting the "Recommended Level" field like this just lets the 
	player know what level they need to be to use the item. The 
	actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this 
	change is purely informational.

The key sentences are:

1. Setting the "Recommended Level" field like this just lets the
player know what level they need to be to use the item.

2. The actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this
change is purely informational.

You are looking at #2, and saying all is well.  Those who are worried
are looking at #1.

#1 says that the recommended level is the levle you need to be to use
the item.  #2 is saying that they did not change any items, but rather
are just displaying information about the item.

Hence, when we find an item that says recommended level is 60, but is
usable below 60, that means that either they tagged it wrong with the
recommended level, *or* it is a bug that it works below 60.  It is
this latter possibility that has the potion people perspiring.
