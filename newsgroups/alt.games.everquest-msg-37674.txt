Indeed.  Your level determines your starting skill when you train your
first point.  If you train specialization at L16, you start at 16.
If you wait until L24, you start at 24.  8 skill points just for waiting
a bit...

Unless you're on a special server and there are not many higher-level
enchanters, NEVER research your own spells unless you have spares of the
components.

Find a higher-level enchanter to do it.  Ask politely, bring the book
and the pages, and most will do it for free.  Failure rates for maxxed
research skill seem to be around 40% if you're at the level of the
spell, and drop very quickly to 5% or so if you're 10 levels above the
spell.

Doing your own research is more satisfying, but it REALLY hurts to fail a
combine on the only Tasarin's Page 26 Right you've seen in weeks.

With your spare pages, practice research so you can do the same favor
for enchanters lower level than you (it's also kind to give away or sell
the completed spells you already have).
