I'm not sure if it's the fact that my usual group has usually been doing a
different theme than we started with(Mistmoore vs. Ruj), but assassinates
have been a lot harder.  The bosses are surrounded by mobs and we can't seem
to pull him/her clean the first time, basically meaning we wipe (if anyone
has tips, please provide them!).  Even when we succeed, we are butting right
up against the time limit - last success was in the final minute.  I don't
like assassinates anymore.  Slaughters seem so much better.  Even though you
only have to kill "X" mobs to spawn the boss, and, hopefully, that number is
less than the number you would have to kill on a slaughter, we end up
killing the mobs anyway to get to the boss.

Collects are the easiest ones we've been on, lately.  I guess they adjusted
it too far the opposite way.  I don't expect this to last.

As am I.  Instead of this next expansion, I really wish they would expand
the LDoN themes - more dungeons, maybe even an arcing storyline for those
who group with each other regularly.
