/boggle.

What exactly do you think DirectX is? An open standard?

Its Microsofts *proprietary* API.

I'm still surprised OpenGL didn't win more game developers over, 
especially with how bad the early directX api's actually were to code 
against. (And the fact that porting from glide to openGL was pretty 
easy, as glide wasn't much more than a performance optimized subset of 
openGL anyway.)

But the war isn't over, OpenGL is still firmly entrenched in the 
professional tier of graphics workstations and that's showing no signs 
of changing anytime soon, ...and with OS X and Linux slowly gaining 
marketshare OpenGL may still have a future in games if developers want 
to write more portable games. And with titles like Doom III out there as 
demonstrations of what OpenGL can do... its still got good visibility.

I ran a TNT or TNT2 Ultra I think when EQ came out, and the only problem 
was utter night blindness in many places even when carrying a GLS due to 
bad vertex lighting support.

Heh. Priority Shift =)
