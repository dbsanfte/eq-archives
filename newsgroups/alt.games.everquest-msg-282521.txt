Just a note from a casual player...I have played EQ since it came out,
and have been loyal and consistent, but I'm NOT a power guilder.  I
have multiple accounts and find boxing tactically challenging and
enjoyable.  I have a small family guild and am usually found in small
random groups with them or with the multitudes of random folks that
just poke around like me.  Its taken me ages to get my warrior to 70,
and I am finishing a Druid to that point (level 63 at the moment).  I
am geared with what most new twinks would throw away.  The no drops I
have a mostly attunable stuff I've managed to get bargains on at the
bazaar.  I did manage to get my Druid Epic a few months ago and that
was a big event for me.  Still working on the WAR one, with the last
two items Old plane raid items that have been difficult.

I read these posts all the time for good info, and you all do so well
in that area.  But there is another reason!  I read because I starve
to know how the BIG zones are, having never seen them (Time, wow not
even in my dreams).  I have explored maybe 15%$ of GoD, 10% of OoW,
20% of PoP, almost nothing in DoN, and just the first two zones in
DoD.  I play in the evening after work, and then not every day.  But
more days than not.

I have found that casual players like me are not able to cut it in any
of these newer expansions and that's disappointing since I buy each
loyally with eagerness.

Maybe I'm crazy but I still do enjoy the grind of levels 10 - 30,
fighting orcs.  I was overjoyed when MM went back to the original
(almost).  I spend lots of time in Mistmoore.  And the thrill of
running through the Dreadlands in my 44 Monk hoping I don't snag a
spider or two...I can assure you I still find a lot of fun doing
things the old way.  Not having facing swords sparkling new graphics,
or a funky new shiled.  The Sarnak shield I have, it SOE ever decided
to show age on the graphics, would be heavily worn!  But EQ is still
fun down here!  Really...

Let me end with a question...Is there a way for someone like me to
enjoy the newer expansions?  Can I see DoN of DoD at all?  Hell most
if not all of DoN and DoD is level 70! with stuff hitting in the
1000's multiple times!  I'll be honest, I decided to beta test with
Prophecy of Ro just to see the zone, and I have considered NOT
expanding any more, since SOE just keeps adding more endgame content,
and nothing in the beginning or middle.  Hoping SOE reads that one...

You know when they add new monsters, and races, and there have been
many, I believe they should equally disperse them from level one to
70.  I bet there are more level 70-80 mobs now in these new expansions
then anything below 45.  I guess my input there to SOE is that they
will NEVER catch up to the power players, and soon, even 100AC, 300HP
items with 3 focus effects won't be enough to satisfy.

Thanks for all the good info on this group!
