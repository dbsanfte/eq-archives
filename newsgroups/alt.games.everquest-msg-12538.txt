Get a SOW in FV and you should be able to outrun the spiders easily. I have
a 24 shaman that travels to and from FV a lot, and have had no problems
yet.... another option is to get invisibility in FV before you go. Be sure
not to cast any spells after you are invisible.

The river route is the most direct and quickest. I have never down zone
edges, and i do not think it will work here, because it will take ages. Just
get a SOW, run like hell, and keep clear of the spiders.
