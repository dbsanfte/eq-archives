Certain "pack" mobs don't start to flee when low on HPs as long as
there are others chasing/fighting you as well, but they will when they
are fighting you alone. It appears to me fleeing triggers the warping.
If they're in a situation where they won't flee because others are
assisting them, they won't warp.
