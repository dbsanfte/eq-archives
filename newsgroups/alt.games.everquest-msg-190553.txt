(tried to post this already but I couldn't find it so I'm re-posting it .If
it shows up twice I apologies.)

I was wandering through West Freeport the other day when this came up on my
chat window:
a prisoner says 'Bog n Goo..Blanket too!!'
a prisoner says 'Bog n Goo..Blanket too!!'
a prisoner hands you something and says,'Hide, hide, safe, cee.. lerk has
the clue.. Must travel.. Travel.. Tunaria's corridor..

Has any one else have this happen?
Is this a new quest for the LOY expansion,or is it old?
I checked my inventory and I didn't have any new items.
