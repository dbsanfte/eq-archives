This is the way I do it too.. I only really adventure when m'lady is
on so when she isnt, I am a Fletcher/Bowyer and Merchant who is
working on his Tailoring.  I have 1 Hotkey setup that stays constant
for my Fletching Business and 6 others that are setup for my auctions
that go.  As one item gets purchased I usually have others on hand and
plug one in.  I will hit 2 or 3 auctions (6 to 9 items) and then my
Prices Negotiable button.  Wait a few minutes and hit the next set.
On occasion I will hit them all once I enter EC and then just hit them
now and then.

Like the guy in EC last night that needed an FBSS so bad that as soon
as his /auc /shouts for it went off the screen he did them again, for
like an hour or so.
