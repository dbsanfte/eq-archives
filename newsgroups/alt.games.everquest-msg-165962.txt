OMG, all those changes were down to you?  My mistake.  I didn't
realise.  Oh and you're hardly Nostradamus to say that some changes to
archery might be on the horizon since devs have posted on The Glade
that they are looking at it.  Most Rangers agree if they fix the LoS
and other projectile engine issues then AM3 damage needs tuned down
the way.  Overall damage will stay the same just less arrows will poof
into the ether IF they manage to unscramble the code.

WTF does that have to do with Warrior/Monk melee damage?  Monks more
often than not have higher ATK, better ratio weapons (Primal/Claw of
Lightning for exact examples) and more effective special attacks than
their Warrior peers.

The only class using melee that outdamage Monks are Rogues from the
rear arc.
