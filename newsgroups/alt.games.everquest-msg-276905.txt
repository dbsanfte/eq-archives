Heh, that's actually what I do, otherwise the golems or gargoyls would
get me.
There was one instance specifically, so he may have been trained there,
where there was a dragoon standing just on the other side of the hill,
near that building by the docks.  He was just where he came into view
from behind the hill and nearby building the same time my field of
vision cut off that area.

If I had been playing in 3rd person, it probably could have been
avoided, and since then and many other blind-sidings, I will often
switch to third-person when in areas of poor visibility.  I just find
it hard to get into any game in anything other than first-person :)

I'll have to look into that.

Xiphos - Never could get into those 3rd-person, over-the-shoulder
games. For some reason, top-down and isometric seem to be ok, just not
over-the-shoulder.
