Kill halflings, lots of 'em, altho this sounds unreasonable and is certainly
out of character and not Role Play at all (a Dark Elf to do the equivalent,
on the other hand would not be so out of character, IMO) but you could fix
your RV faction much quicker and easier providing you only drop to
apprehensive.
This is the easiest way (and only I can think of) to get faction with the
dread guard so to be safe in  Nek Forest.
The quest that Leo suggested normally requires some faction before working
(My Human rogue cannot perform it) not sure invis helps with that (do you
not become visible when handing over items?)
If you can do that then you'll be fine, about 100 bottles should (4 at a
time) should get you to apprehensive. You will not gain faction with the
Indigo Botherhood tho' (That is the Warrior and SK guilds from what I can
work out) so stay clear of them, other than that you'll have the freedom of
Neriak. You'll get some funny looks off players if you make it.

The indigo Brother hood faction you can gain by killing Elves in Tim. Deep
but I wouldn't suggest that, you don't strictly need the faction with them
to be able to use Neriak (My SK is still KoS to the Indi-Bro)
