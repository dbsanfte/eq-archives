Seems like there should be a train station in PC.  Yesterday evening, there
was a train going to SH almost every 10 minutes on the dot.  I was almost
killed when I zoned from SH to PC and found about 20 mobs waiting for me.
The toons they were chasing probably zoned at the same time as I did.  The
second time I was trained on, it was unannounced and I didn't live at all.

 It was so bad yesterday I took my 18 pally to HHK to finish the night.  If
only there was a way to get Sony to penalize toon for unannounced train.
