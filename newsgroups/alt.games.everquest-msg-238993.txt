I heard that melee items with +mana had the same +endurance, and saw
a couple of items where that was true, don't know if that's the rule
or not as the bard disciplines have such timers/endurance cost that
endurance is totally irrelevant.

Checking bazaar items now it seems to hold in many cases, a White
Dragon Helm (Velious era) now has the same amount of endurance as mana
(60), as has Barbed Rubicite Pauldrons and Hierophant's Cloak. Items
with no mana like Velium Encrusted Gauntlets or my Breastplate of
Eradication have no endurance added.

OTOH, a Cloak of Crystalline Waters (also Velious) has 50 mana but no
endurance added, Drakkel Wolf Claws has 40 mana but no endurance.

Doesn't seem like any pre-velious gear has had endurance added, but it's
pretty much all crap either way :)
