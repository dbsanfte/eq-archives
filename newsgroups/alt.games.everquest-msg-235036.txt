I recently got a hold of this sword, but I don't know anything about it. Is
this a good sword? Is there anything special about it? The guy I got the
sword from said it was worth 3000 plat. Why then would he trade it to me for
68 spider silks. Any info on this sword would be greatly appreciated. What
is its max hit point?
