Yup, I got stuck doing something like that.  I was in LOIO near the
mill and someone yells for help.  I go over and root the mob and he
asks me to kill it.  I did so and he says thanks and runs off.  (So
far, no big deal).  This starts to happen repeatedly and I notice that
he beats the thing just over half dead and then yells for help waiting
for someone else to finish it off so he gets the exp.  Nothing like
forced PL'ing.  He did this so much that people finally told him not
to pull any more cuz no one will help him.  I guess he didn't believe
it  because I saw it corpse there when I passed through later.
