As a level 49 Iksar Beastlord I have now have Invis, which in some
areas I actually find more useful than having my pet by my side (even
though it fizzles 99% of the time, buy a few invis potions for
backup). I spent the 50p and bought Summon Companion by Shady just
recently as I am sometimes soloing in Emerald Jungle, and here are
some observations. While medding do NOT sit as close as possible to
the walls of a zone or wall (this applies double in dungeons if it can
be helped) - Also use Shrink whenever possible in dungeons on pet, as
makes life easier on other party members trying to get by your monster
pet. I usually stand up and see my pet's tail sticking out of the wall
or zone each time this happens, and 90% of the time have to cast
summon companion. I do just like you do every few steps I actually hit
the hot key for /pet follow me and almost 50% of the time the darn
warder is like 100 yards either in front or behind me, and I do SOW
her otherwise she'd be even further off. Probably best not to have SOW
going into Dungeons to make following you easier -- pain in the butt
but you can't cast sow anyway in dungeons.
