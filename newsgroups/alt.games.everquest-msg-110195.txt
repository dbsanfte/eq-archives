They don't think the price should drop for the skins they want to sell
me, well, I don't think the price should drop for the packs I'm

Riiiiight. That explains why every other player and her twink has a
master tailor in her pants.

You forget who you're talking to? I know exactly how much effort it
takes to get that skill. That you are able to make them as well is
commendable, but don't pretend that the skill is trivial to reach.

Selling a pack for less than I can get is moronic. If I can get 100
plat for it, then good business practice demands that I get 100 plat.
If you want to run a charity and sell things for half price, that's
your prerogative, but kindly don't attempt to dictate my business to
me.

They're welcome to get the skill up themselves, then. After all, it's
so easy, right?

Until you're encumbered.

Like you said, though - supply and demand. I am selling the packs just
fine for 100 plat, so I guess there is still a demand for them, even
at that price. Kinda puts a sock in your whole "gouging" theory.
