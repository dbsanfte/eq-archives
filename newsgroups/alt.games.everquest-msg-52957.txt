For the other side of the coin try being non-gear dependant like a mage.
Nothing you can aquire will improve your abilities, damage output or
survival odds with very few exceptions, like Jboots. We are also pennyless,
on endless searches/camps for research components and the always elusive
"Robe of  a Different Color" with minimal stat increases. I'm not saying
either is a good thing or a bad thing. It's just a thing.
