You hit on some of the big group problems in the game hence why i prefer 
solo and am getting annoyed by most of the quest needing groups. A good 
group is great but is it worth all the time and effort for the rarity. I 
also think the atmosphere is lost by constant lfg blah blah blah lfg blah 
blah blah - sending and recieving.

I suppose the thing to do is get into a guild and get some good friends 
about the same lvl as I had on Horizons, I am saddened that they were French 
so I parted for an English server and am reluctant to join a guild in case 
of dissapointment.
