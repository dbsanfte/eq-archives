Ok i will play for awhile - can you give me some concrete examples to ponder

The only thing I see, in a parliamentary democracy, is that your electorate
has to be more on your toes to keep your govt from taking freedoms away from
you. Therefore, it easier to limit your freedoms in that system than a
constitutional democracy. If so, i do not envy you the task; because the
price of freedom is always eternal vigilance ( I forget who said that -
Thomas Jefferson maybe). Although, hopefully, that would make you more aware
of govt actions and tougher about them. However, at the same time it will
make your politicians less likely to think things thru and go with the
emotional moment. Is that a fair assessment?

Ok perhaps poor choice of words when you said "inheriting." But how do you
know that is bad for Australia? It may be exactly what is needed? Or is it
that this is your view of the US; and since it is the US, it, therefore,
must be bad?

No disrespect intended, but where is the gurantee of these human rights?
Where is it written that you have human rights? What court will enforce
these rights? What police force will make the arrest? There is human
decency - but no human rights.If Australia were invaded tommorrow what are
you going to do parade your human rights or grab a rifle?

and b) in international convention (www.unhcr.ch).

International convention is a matter of treaties. If a nation does not sign
the treaty then it is not a party to the treaty. Therefore, how do you
enforce something on that a nation that does not agree with. Only by force
of arms. And what if you cannot enforce it, or you decide to break it, or
you just decide to not live up to it,  it  is worthless. And those things
happen all the time with treaties. That is the dillemna of human rights -
might makes right.  " God is on the side of the heavy battalions" -
Bismarck.  Human rights - Interesting concept just not reality based.
Cynically, it seems to be a weaker nation that is always spouting about
human rights and not the stronger one. Who guaranteed the rights of the
Cambodians or the Rwandans. Was Australia inclined to rush her troops
there - I think not. And by the way you have some of the best troops in the
world!

Hey dont stand to close - you might get hit with a short artillery round.
