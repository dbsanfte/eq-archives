The item isn't that much of an improvement for me *personally* to put in
the time - AAs, and now PoP levelling will always take precedence.

I've got 60hps on smithed shoulders currently, plus access to far
superior shoulders should I choose to spend the DKP on them. I'm not
gonna waste my time, as well as 3 other char's time, spending hours and
hours killing greenies for faction, when we could all be gaining exp.
Ultimately, the gain from shoulders is overshadowed by well spent AAs.

That's why I asked. Looking for something I can do on a second comp for
30 mins while waiting on raids with my main, or checking bazaar a couple
of times a day. If I could get them with pp and little timesink, then
the improvement becomes viable.

The quest items are 3 faction hits per handin? How many items per
handin? And what exactly are the items called?

I'll probably be able to gather fairly early on whether vendor diving
and bazaar could reliably get me enough faction in a small enough period
of time, then it's just (cough) a case of getting the nodrop quest
parts.
