That GM was talking out of his ass. Next time you get ingame, petition
again and if you get the same GM then tell him his reply is
unsatisfactory and request the name of his superior, if you get a
different GM he'll probably give it to you. Also, it's probably worth
a try to e-mail sony customer support directly (check their web site
for the address). You have about a 2 week window where they can go
back and check logs so don't wait too long. 

There's no such thing as having too high of a faction for turning in
the tear, that one's been proved 100s of times by multiquesting that
particular turnin, or just by people skipping the Hole part of the
epic. There was a bug when they first revamped CoM a few months ago
where Rak was eating tears, it sounds like that one has popped up
again.
