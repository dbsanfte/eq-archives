For twisting songs the easy way.  Assume I have a Healing song in slot
one, and a Mana song in slot two: I now want to sing these while the
party meds up.  In the old days I would either button-mash manually,
which was a reall nuisance, or make a comparatively fiddly five-line
macro.  Nowadays I just have a one-line macro with

/melody 1, 2

on it, and that's it.  It will automatically repeat until it gets
interrupted or you cancel it. I have about 5 macro buttons with
various /melody combinations in it, and even at lvl 27 I can
comfortable twist 3 or 4 songs together this way.  The melody macro
can easily be modified on the fly, too, if you want to adjust a set of
songs or add/delete one.
