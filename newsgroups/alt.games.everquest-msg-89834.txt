All my characters solo. In order of soloing preference:
1. Half-Elf Bard level 17.
2. Human Druid Level 16.
3. Ogre SK level 13.
3. Troll Warrior level 9.
3. Half-Elf Rogue level 10.
3. Human Monk Level 11.
3. Half-Elf Ranger Level 15. (Don't like rangers anymore.)
3. Erudite Enchanter level 10 (Ergh. Might remake it as a human.)
3. Iksar Necromancer Level 3.

Of all of them, my favorite and the easiest to solo is my level 17 bard.
They are surprisingly self-sufficient.

Most songs don't use mana. So instead of waiting for 2 bars to fill, you
usually only have to wait for one.

You can play songs while on the run unlike casters who have to be still to
cast. Since you can play songs while on the run, kiting is a breeze.

Using instruments makes songs more effective. But if you don't have an
instrument equipped, you can still use a song that uses an instument (As
opposed a song that uses your singing skill) by singing.

Songs can be twisted (Playing multiple songs quickly so you can gain the
benefits of multiple songs.) Right now, I can twist 4 songs with ease. Most
songs can be stacked (The effects will stack. For example, if you play two
songs with a skill-up in str. The first one with +3 str and the second with
+2, you will have +5 str instead of +3 or +2.)

I can be fighting an enemy, twisting songs, and I can keep the enemy
targeted while playing a song for myself. Don't have to worry about
screw-ups because of bad targetting.

Some skills (See www.eqdiva.com for full list.)

10 Dodge
10 Meditate (Instead of other classes who get magic first then meditate,
bards can meditate before they can use the songs which require mana.)
12 Forage (Saves money.)
17 Dual Wield
17 Sneak
20 Sense Traps
24 Safe Fall
25 Hide
26 Instill Doubt
30 Disarm Traps
35 Track
40 Pick Lock
51 Resistance
53 Parry
54 Fearless
55 Deftdance
58 Riposte
60 Puretone

My favorite songs so far (See www.eqdiva.com for a full list.)

5 Selos Accelerando - Increase movement speed. (Comparable to SoW expect you
don't have to wait until level 14.)

6 Hymn of Restoration - Increases hitpoint regeneration of entire group by 4
to 19 hitpoints per tick.

11 Cinda's Charismatic Carillon Increases faction by one or two faction
rankings with an NPC. Affects all NPCs
with that faction in the zone. **Great for getting better prices in buying
and selling,** and **opens up quest
opportunities.** This song only improves faction ratings of
some NPCs that are dubious or higher. Certain NPCs and KOS NPCs are
unaffected by this song.

12 Brusco's Boastful Bellow Direct Damage to target (7-31), and knockback to
PCs

16 Tarew's Aquatic Ayre Allows entire group to breath underwater. **Nice to
play when trying to increase
your swimming skill,** who knows when you'll fall off that boat! Useful when
fighting underwater such as in
Kedge Keep. (Like druid song with same effect.)

Some songs in the immediate future I am looking forward to:

19 Shauri's Sonorous Clouding Invisibility, See Invisble for entire group;
Useful when
exploring unfamiliar territory. Too bad you can't twist it with any other
song, like Selos.

20 Cassindra's Chant of Clarity Similar to Enchanter's Breeze, this song
will increase
mana regeneration rate by 2 per tick

21 Melanie's Mellifluous Motion Randomly teleports each group member. Each
member gets
flung somewhere else. (Whee!)

24 Lyssa's Veracious Concord Party Ultravision, See Invisible; Pretty neat
when you fire
 up this song at night for the humans, barbarians, and erudites in your
group;

27 Solon's Song of the Sirens Charms the target and turns it into your pet
for up to 15
seconds. Highly dependent on your charisma. Will not work on 37+ mobs, but
there is a charm
upgrade by then. High aggro effect, but you can turn that into your
advantage when the mob
is aggroing on a caster. Useful when your party pulls more than 1 mob, put
one on your side!
(15 seconds isn't very long but I really enjoy turning mobs into pets.)

28 Crisson's Pixie Strike Mesmerize (up to 15 seconds), lower magic
resistance (up to 20
points), knock-back effect to target

30 Amplification Enhances songs by a certain modifer. Affects only
sing-skilled songs
and the modifer is greater than the bard epic in most cases.

31     Agilmente's Aria of Eagles Levitation for entire group. Limited
Range, so either
don't use with party members, or tell them to follow you at their own risk!

There are *tons* of others with different effects. Buffs, debuffs,
mezmerize, etc.

Some of the tactics I have been using:
(Now in LoIO)
1. Play Selo's Accelerando.
2. Play Brusco's Boastful Bellow.
3. Run.
4. Stop if the mob is out of range.
5. See 2
6. Run
7. See 1
8. Play Hymn of Restoration, if neccesary.
9. Repeat, if neccesary. Rinse.

Maybe someone else with more exprience can add whether soloing the higher
leavels is feasable or not..
