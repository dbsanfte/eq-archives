26 Pal here who has pretty much made her living soloing. The other
night in DS I was asked, albeit politely, to repeatedly join a group.
I was having a decent time hunting shrooms in the ruins so declined
each time. Finally they got really miffed shouting "You will never get
anywhere in this game soloing."

What do people think about this? I mean, OK so I may not get to level
60 as a solo, but shouldnt this be about what each person enjoys the
most?

Thanks.

Annie
