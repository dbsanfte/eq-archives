Hehehe, I have my entire bank filled with deluxe sewing kit
as well as deluxe sewing kits on my alts (and in their banks
as well).  I guess I have a total of about 30.

I have one with me at all times.  It's good for tailoring, but
it REALLY comes in handy when I'm hunting mammoths.  Those tusks
(which are giant) fit in the deluxe sewing kit so I am able to
carry 10 in the kit (I weigh a ton, but it beats running to Halas
all the time).
