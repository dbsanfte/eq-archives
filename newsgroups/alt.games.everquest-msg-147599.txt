FYI, I play a Shaman, so don't preconceive:

    Bonechips: I keep one in a main inventory slot, totally killing a bag
spot, and a stack in a bag. Here's why: Rezzes. Well one's that aren't
immediate. I can leave a single bonechip on my corpse so my bod don't poof
(since the sit there for a while after ya loot thing don't work anymore).
Clickables. It's easy to swap out an inventory item for clickables simply
right clicking the item with the chips still in hand, then swap them again.
    Gear: A few charisma items for selling... it's nice to have, even with a
good charisma buff in my spellbook, it still helps. 2 perm effect items when
worn, Lev and everlasting breath. Both are handy to have. 3 items that get
swapped between wisdom and ac depending on groups/raids/soloing.
    I also keep a few 10 shot potions handy, IVU (cause I don't get that in
my spellbook) and Shrink for those places that my spell won't cast and it's
inconvenient to be a barbie.
    The normal bag of food and water, even though I can summon in
emergencies, it's rather a pain to do it everytime I log in.
