Look for the signs that say ????. From your guild hall, you can go right
or left across the swing bridge to 2/3 lifts in Kelethin. The one to
right is newbie lift because it is near newbie area (Guard Brookrock).
the one to left is POD lift because Priest of Discord is near it.

If, from POD lift platform you go north, north, veer right, veer left,
you will be on ORC lift because you go north from here to ORC hill and
Crushbone.

Hint, click on your corpse and clean them up.
From a distance, click on something, then enter /con into chat window.
You will want blues until you know what you are doing.

Also rotate your weapons, slash, bash, hand to hand from early on.
Assuming you've worked out how to get basic training.

As mentioned, http://www.dotnetdiva.com seems best for bards. Don't let
the old fogey bards there either give you a hard time. They just don't
like this modern music the news bards are singing {:-).

There are actually quite a few other bard guides out there that I found
before diva, that I prefer to diva. Enter bard everquest into google.

The locate corpses si a service bards can provide. Once you get to level
10, you have to visit your corpse everytime you die to recover your
stuff. Bards get it easy with locate corpse. Bards can help other people
to locate theirs as well. You can also find dead mobs to loot as well
{:-)

she asks for 2, but rewars on four I think. Just keep colleting and
giving them to her until you no longer get experience.

The top right box is just that you are a bard. You need to buy a basic
instrument (drum or flute) when you reach the level that you can train
percussion and wind skills. Woops, its drum, then strings, then wind,
then brass. Just buy the basic and earn the higher as you play the game.
I've brought higher drums from a player (was /auc) and higher wind from
a merchant, so it doesn't hurt to check the inventory of merchants from
time to time.

Grouping shares the experience. I'd wait until level 10. the problem is
that each player needs enough hit points for group interaction to work
(spell casting, song singing, assisting, etc).

Yes, be glad. No, you don't pay unless you negotiate this first.
Basically, you are helping these people by letting them train their
spell casting, just like you need to train your songs. Many people help
lower levels for various reasons apart from above. Dieing sucks and they
remember what it was like as a low level.

Do not come to rely on these heals and buffs. Learn to play your
character with what it has and just accept these as icing on the cake.

Trades cost basically. If you have the bazaar, then you can trade stuff
you loot for plat to buy stuff you need, like songs, boxes for bank
slots, back packs for inventory, instruments, etc

Do your bard newbie armour quest. that armour will last you to level
30s. Also pulls the chicks like nothing on earth (they love the colour
{:-). Talk to Sarilyn (back trainer)

Trades I found most useful was baking as it can save you buying food.
BTW, chunk of meat is food you can just eat. So food helps with stats
too. apart from that, I've done some trade to relieve boredom really.
Aparently there are some benefits, but I haven't found any really
compelling reason yet. Although some chr need tradeskills to achieve
higher quests.

Yes, they have, but don't let that bother you. Better here than in the
game. Most of the discussion here is of "angles on a pin head" type
anyway.
