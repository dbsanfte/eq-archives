Only what you'll find on the website if you look around.

Official answer: "Soon".

Aparently, it will be the new interface. Period. There will be no
windowed mode anymore.

>Will you have the option of using the old one as well?

Unknown.

Considering they have outright said it will be a free, independant
upgrade, I'm sure not many people think this. And they can't really
upgrade the interface for only one server. They can add zones for one
server, but the interface is in a file that is used by all servers.
