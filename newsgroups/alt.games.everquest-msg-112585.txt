Couldn't the recommended level on items alleviate or even "cure" twinking,
depending on how strong the bad effect of using something when you are
too low? For example, if the mob that dropped the item is more than say
six levels above a character, and the character tried to use it, then the
item
could be made to auto-destruct (decay, break, whatever). Thus, sure you
could twink, but it wouldn't do any good. This way, it would affect friends
twinking friends, too.

just throwing it out there,
