I think the first 'sense of awe' i got was when i spotted the shape of a
huge ship on the horizon, its was of course the boat to FV, and i was on the
shuttle from BB.
I can rememeber looking at that ship and wondering what lay on the other
side of the ocean! It was of course Ill omen i went to, shame that :) all
that build up for ill omen.
