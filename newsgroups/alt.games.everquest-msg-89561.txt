The entire description of the event sounded pretty nice actually.  It was
not just about handing out the loot.  I don't know how long it took, but
basically, a Gnome came wandering in with his mechanical dragon that was
flying around.  After some time, the dragon fell to the ground, and the
Gnome asked for some help in fixing it.  Basically, he ended up asking
people to get him a sprocket.  A druid in our guild, bound, ported, got the
sprocket, gated back, and handed it over.  He was not expecting to be given
an item like that for playing along with the story.  As to the sky, beats
the heck out of me.

Certainly, that even sounds a lot better than the only one I have been
involved in.  I sat down to camp out, someone struck up a conversation with
me, then he got charmed, beat on me a bit, I got feared by some uber
centaur, spun around and around for a while with 2 mobs and the charmed
person beating me to death.  Wheee, wasn't that fun.  No clue where my
corpse was, bound somewhere far off.  Petitioned, made it back to SK, it's
now about an hour after I had intended to go to bed, some kind soul found my
corpse for me, I started looting when a guide answered my petition.  He did
give me a CS rez, just in case, as I did not know if I had lost any xp.
That was the point at which I decided that GM events were to be avoided at
all costs.  This one with the Gnome, restored some hope of there being some
decent events that might actually involve roleplaying.
