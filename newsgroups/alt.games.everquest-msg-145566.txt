Sebilis and HS were probably the 2 main dungeons in old world EQ,  HS
without a rogue is an absolute PITA, Sebilis without a rogue excludes you
from the most lucrative loot in the zone.

Having locked doors is always good, but there should be a "rogueless" method
too.  I shouldnt be massively hindered in HS because I can't find a rogue
