-- I've thought about it, but I have too much time and game experience
invested him to do that.  That would be like disinheriting a child in
order to adopt another one, wouldn't be the same.  And he's not that
much of a "problem child" that I can't work with him, just seeking to
keep upping his Wisdom primarily.  Maybe this all sounds too
sentimental, but since he's my first EQ character, there are a lot of
good memories there.  Hunting in Blackburrow, all the players there,
etc, running across Antonica to go hunt in Oasis, etc. I'm sure
everyone has their own, esp if you've been around for awhile.

From my posts you can probably tell I'm not into the "Uber" playing
that much, primarily because of time constraints but also because I
like to explore a lot and take my time to "feel" how a place is.  To
me, this is one of EQ's biggest strengths, as far as creating a game
"world."
