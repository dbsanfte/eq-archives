But you see, I'm not Stan Mann, as has been mentioned previously,
StanMann is my handle, nothing more, nothing less.  :)  My name is Stan,
or Stanislaw, not Stanley or dude.

And No, I'm not a motivational speaker.  I couldn't care less if someone
does, or doesn't call me.

learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
