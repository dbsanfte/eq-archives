I love my druid and he is very welcome in any dungeon crawl, whether
it be LDoN or traditional.

My role at 65 (and with a pretty big mana pool) is usually that of
primary healer. With enough AA's in it, you can almost rival a cleric.
 Add snare, DS, regen and the ocassional 3.5K nuke in there, and I've
found myself very welcome in any group.

Druids get a little of just about everything, but never quite as good
as someone else's, but, played well, they can really add a lot to a
group.
