That's so disappointing.
I think you did the right thing - I can't believe people are silly enough to
make the cleric do the pulling.
I wouldn't even join a group the "leader" is in - if he can't organise an
adventure, he would be just as ordinary in a group.
If you are the only one bailing or the first one to bail there is no
problem, I think most groups can get by with one person dropping out/going
LD at a stretch.

The last adventure I went on, my bf's pally was the main tank/puller - as we
had not participated in many adventures, we said so at the onset (before the
adventure was accepted) and said that any advice would be welcomed due to
this.
The group ended up failing by one drop, but all through the adventure the
majority of the group members were complaining about the drop rate (which
was very slow) and the pull rate.
No-one offered to assist in either role during the adventure until the end
when they said just pull as many as possible to get the rate up(and my necro
spent her time mezzing the excess adds).
Makes you only want to group with friends and not take the chance.
