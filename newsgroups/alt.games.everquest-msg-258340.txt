In pickup groups incompetent Enchanters are not particularly rare,
and incompetent Clerics and Shaman verge on common.  Incompetent
Paladins are apparently routine, judging by both the ignorance
of Paladin CC abilities (including in this thread :-p) and the
amazement of those who witness a Paladin actually making a strong
contribution to a group.  In fact, IME only Druids (non-halfling),
Warriors, and Shadowknights seem to routinely have at least half a
clue, everybody else is a complete crapshoot.  Often makes me
wonder what people are doing as they level up, since paying
attention is apparently not an option.

It's not all thorns and leeches though, I've found that most
players will accept advice if given tactfully.
