That's *always* been the case.  If you'd rather not grind out a
level you'd go do something else.   Getting double XP doesn't
change that at all;  it just gives you an excuse to quit for the
night -- and a bit of a reward for doing so.

That depends, of course -- 'blue exp' or no 'blue exp,' the same
as it always has.

Again, *how?*   If you aren't the type to grind out 12 hrs of XP,
you're not that type.   If you are, you are.   Getting 'maximum
XP' for your playing time involves getting XP in some form,
not playing an alt or crafting or whatever.

If you have two or three goals, you did what you had to do to
meet those two or three goals.   How does getting extra XP
*change* that?

Or people who believe getting one goal out of the way first means
they'll be able to better accomplish their other goals.   It's the same
argument for splitting XP and AAXP in EQ -- it's NOT "more
efficient" to split it -- but it gives *some* people 'additional rewards'
for doing so.

If you want to *eliminate* grinding you make it so people without
'blue exp' (or 'vitality' or whatever you want to call it) are less
effective in gaining *normal* XP.   Make it like EQ's endurance:
if you don't have it, you're a wimp (in some way that matters to the
game for your character.)   You can't 'run' or med or your normal
swing rate is cut by 2/3rds or your fizzle rate increases by 5000% or
whatever.   That would *eliminate* grinding.   'Blue exp' (or EQ2's
vitality) doesn't do *anything* like that -- you just don't gain XP
as quickly.  But it's *still* more quickly than it would be watching
a movie or crafting or whatever else doesn't involve getting XP.

So, again, WoW's "blue exp" (and EQ2's vitality) doesn't *eliminate*
grinding;  it simply allows the more casual player to avoid falling behind
in XP as much as they would otherwise.  (With the assumption you
lose 'blue exp' quicker while adventuring than you gain it, of course.)
