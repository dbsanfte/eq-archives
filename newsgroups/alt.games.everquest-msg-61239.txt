Two nights ago, my main dinged 54. Shortly after dinging, I looked at
my inventory to see what my new HP/AC would be, and crashed to desktop
(*very* fast way to log out, though). Logged back in, told a friend
I'd dinged and crashed, he told me the same thing happened when his
rogue dinged 29.

Last night, I messed around with alts. First, I dinged my mage to 9. I
was sitting, camping, took a peek at inventory at the very instant a
shadow wolf took a swipe at me and didn't crash. However, there was a
distorted grey bar on the inventory, which looked like someone had
smeared out a portion of the grey sidebar with my stats horizontally
across the middle of the screen (I use the old inventory), and it
stayed on the inventory screen until after I'd looted the shadow wolf.
I camped, logged in my shadow knight, my partner (who also is that 29
rogue) and I dinged 21. He crashed immediately after we dinged. I
waited around a while, medded up, worked on sense heading, cast a few
divination spells, looked at inventory and found myself staring at my
desktop. Well, it was late and I was going to camp anyway, so I didn't
log back in. Tonight, I'll ask my friend if he's looked at inventory
when he's crashed after dinging, and /bugreport my pseudo-theory.

The question is: has something like this happened to anyone else?
