Very true, some people DO see value in waking the Sleeper.

But let's look at the value they find in it.

Some do it for notoriety.  But honestly, anyone after the first couple 
guilds who did it, who didn't know the lasting ramifications, really don't 
deserve much notoriety.  Because it's been done.

Yes, killing Ventaani is still an accomplishment for a guild working 
through Sleeper's pre-awakening.  But waking the Sleeper isn't. 

Others do it to keep some of the gear out of the lower guilds hands to 
keep them from progressing as quickly.  It's not absolutely NECESARRY 
gear, but keeping it from them does slow them down.

These are the only two real reasons for waking the Sleeper.  Neither one 
is really a mark of high integrity.

So... going back to my  original question... why should they be 
congratulated.  I'll be first in line to congratulate a guild when they 
finally are able to kill Ventaani.  But when they wake the Sleeper?  Nah.

Sure, eventually it was going to be broken.  Doesn't mean you shouldn't be 
upset when it happens.

The whole thing is the "kid with a gun" argument.

Verant was dumb for giving the kid the gun... the kid was obviously 
eventually gonna shoot.

But petting the kid on the head and saying "good job" when he shoots 
doesn't make any sense to me.

That's where my real confusion lies in this thread.
