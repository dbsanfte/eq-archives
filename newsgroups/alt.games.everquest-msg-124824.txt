Are we talking about the same item?

Allahkhazam lists it as both melee slots, a 3/10 1hb weapon. 

So with nasty amounts of haste this thing could hit twice a second, four 
times if you get lucky and hit two double attacks. That's 120 - 240 times a 
minute your primary hand damage bonus can be applied. That is pain, and 
lots of it.

...and a CoT will outdamage the FB. Offhand is all about ratio.
