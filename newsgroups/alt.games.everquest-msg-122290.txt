  I've heard something about bleeding the vendors or buying the vendors =

don't know, extended resources so you don't have to go and kill =
sh*tloads of spiders for their silk, or is this a tactic to purchase =
better armor and weapons without going thru a player?

  Thanks....

  Also, could someone drop a line on how to do the new quests in BB and =
QH with the gnolls?

  One last thing, what level/time should I think about starting an =
enchanter(erudin) on jewelrycraft?  I have a character right now that =
can supplement just about 50pp to 100pp a week(don't play too =
much)....would ASAP be the best time to start, or when I have, say 500pp =
or so built up, extra,to use?

  Thanks for any and all help and answers!!!:)


  best would be  to save up a huge lump sum  to start but after that =
just dso it in little bits, youll soon find out jewel crafting is VERY =
expensive being a 250skill jewler i know it took me awhile to master the =
skill  but its worth it :)

  i dont know about  the buying vendor out thing though btu with jewel =
crafting if you enchant the metal  before you combine you can usually =
get more back from the vendor than you paid for it
