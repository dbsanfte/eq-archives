been a long time since there was any EQOA questions in here.

One thing: what is the quest that requires a dark elf to go to Halas?  I 
think you stumbled on a quest you can't complete because the pasty-faced 
Barbarians won't like you very much.

There are tons of maps at eqoamaps.com check them out they'll help you 
alot.  The way I usually get to the halas for the first time is to coach to  
Darvar Manor/Jared's Blight or Mount Hatespike (that's an evil coachman, 
you should be able to get that one) then swim up the river to Halas.  The 
river goes straight there.  If you stay in the middle of the river you 
don't get agro from wandering goblins.  Don't approach the town until you 
check if they'll kill you first.  Might have to delete that quest from your 
journal :(

Have fun
