Quote from the original post to support your contention that he "only got
into the guild based on that lie".  Here's the relevant portion so you don't
even have to look it up:

But I see that you already realized your error and now claim simply a "lie
through omission."  I won't start down that slippery slope, but I'll gladly
follow along dropping boulders the entire time should you decide to lead the
way.  =)
