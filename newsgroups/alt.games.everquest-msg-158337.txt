They've been making some pretty big changes in EQ.  Soul binders, the
removal of the class XP penalties, medding without the spell book below
level 35, mana regen (they once said that it was very unlikely they would
ever have anything better than FT3 on an item...and KEI would have been
inconceivably two years ago), the graveyards in PoP.

So, what should be next?

I'd like to see the death penalty changed to not cause level loss.  A death
when you have low XP in the level should drop you back to the start of the
level, and return you to your bind point with res effects.  The res effects
are to prevent using people who are not far into the level for easy zerging.

This would encourage bold, adventurous exploring and experimentation when
you level.
