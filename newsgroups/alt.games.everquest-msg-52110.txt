On many fronts you come across as a very reasonable and intelligent person.
I always enjoy debating with you, even when they become heated.  A long
debate on the definition of spam comes to mind.

However, I simply can not understand this one argument you put forth about
selling items for real world money.  Well, let me start by saying I
understand how farming items for ebay can undermine the economy in EQ, well
in any MMOG really, but it's more prevelant in EQ because those items don't
deteriorate.  Rampant eBay farming saturates the economy even further and
devalues those items.  I can understand why VI doesn't want it to happen.
What I don't understand is how you can point fingers around and decide who
is and who isn't an idiot because of the way they choose to spend their
money.

A person could just as easily say we are all idiots because we choose to
spend money on this game in the first place.  A person could call you an
idiot for spending money on photography equipment.  The list goes on.
People can call people idiots for any absatract reason they choose to come
up with, but to do so usually shows a degree of ignorance on their part.

It seems to me that if a person wants to spend his/her money on platinum
pieces in a video game, and those platinum pieces make his/her experience
more enjoyable, then that is money well spent.

Best Regards
