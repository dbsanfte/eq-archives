but then there is the big *but* ....  Pallys can reasonably solo, 
clerics cant. i am stuck needing a group to make any decent amount of 
xp, as i can reasonably kill light bue casting mobs or dark blye 
noncasters...pallys can dependably solo dark blues. if everybody goes 
for the shammy/palle combo, i am screwed out of a possible xp group.

FWIW, i still will solo LB in dl at 54 when sitting LFG and 
tradeskilling gets to me. If I were guilded on my main, it wouldnt be so 
bad [my alt is an 18 chanter in an 'alt'/seldom play guild.] Getting 
pickup groups in the planes is often not an option as I have a fair list 
of 
never-will-i-group-with-this-idiot-if-he-were-the-last-eq-player-in-the-universe 
players...tanks who refuse to listen to me when i say i dont have 
mana...casters who instantly nuke without waiting for the tank to get 
agro...people who i *know* understand english but refuse to speak 
it/foreign language spam conversations in ooc/shout...and yes a 90% rez 
is good, but it is still a time killer to have to go back, rez people 
and myself, then schlep back to pok for kei, then get back to the 
group...sometimes a wipe without a cleric epic is a 45 minute to an hour 
delay. I have actually had my former guildies [when still in guild] tell 
me outright they didnt need a cleric in the group, they had a 
shammy/palle combo...the palle goes link dead and *then* they need me to 
come rez them. I have even got nastygrams because i only do a 90% and 
didnt have my epic...sort of a catch 22...they want me to be epiced/be 
56, but they wouldnt help me epic or group with me for xp.....then after 
I deguilded, an ixiblat doubleheader was arranged by a friend in the 
guild whos hubby needed ix, so she told everybdy it was a double header 
and they all agreed...they smacked ixi for the guildie and all but 3 
people including my game hubby and 2 friends bailed out...

And people say the cleric epic is the easiest to get...perhaps, but only 
if you have 11-18 people you can depend on to drop what they are doing 
and are strong enough to do chardok/ragefire on a whim...
