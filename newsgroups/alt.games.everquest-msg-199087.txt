Monica, yes.  There will be a setup fee that'll cost you somewhere between
$15-$20 and after that you'll pay $13 a month for the subscription.  I've
never played The Realm or even heard of it, though I'm not that
knowledgeable about online RPG's.  $13 might sound like a lot for a monthly
subscription, but for me it's a great price considering the fact that people
actually pay around $50 a month for satellite television and most of the
time can't find anything to watch.  In that respect, EverQuest is a bargain
as its sure to keep you entertained.

Gordon
