He explained the reason.  LCD manufacturers are not in any big rush
to make their products look bad.  So in many cases they either don't
provide the response time spec at all, or they provide a misleading
spec:

And the people who say LCD is fine for gaming simply haven't
pushed their systems hard enough, or have adjusted to an LCD and
have forgetten how much better their games look on a CRT.
