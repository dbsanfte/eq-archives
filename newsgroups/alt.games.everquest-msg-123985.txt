Hm, not sure about that.  Interesting, if true.  Somewhere, a while back, 
on the eqtraders boards I found a couple interesting things.  One was a 
graph based on tons of tailoring skill up data and a bit of curve fitting 
that graphed average number of attempts for a skill up versus wis.  It 
formed a neat hyperbola of the form y=A/x+B, can't remember what the 
constants A and B were. :)  Net result is, yes, higher wis will always 
mean higher skill ups (doesn't entirely rule out the even-odd and 255 
weirdness you mention, but it seems unlikely), and secondarily, the higher 
you go with wis, the less benefit -still more- wis gives you.  The curve 
looked pretty darn flat from about 220 onward.

The second interesting thing is the debate over what's being called 
Laurefin's formula for successes.  

 %chance of success = (skill*1.15)-(trivial-70)

There is some debate about whether the 70 should be more 65ish, and one 
guy who -insists- the 1.15 should just be 1.00, but all of these seem to 
fit the data pretty darn well.  So it probably is solely a function of 
skill level and the item's trivial.

Some folks have taken it backward, and noticed that this implies that

 trivial = (skill*1.15)-(%chance-70) 

(hmm... have I done that right? I'm feeling very non-algebraic at the 
moment. :) )

So if we can figure out the approximate %chance of success a 250 jeweler 
has with, say, Velium BD Bracers, we can deduce their approximate trivial 
level.  I think the estimates were 280-290ish.
