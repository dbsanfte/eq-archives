Uhh hate to disagree with you Kaev but I have a 51 mage with 12
aa points and a 55 druid and without a doubt the mage was WAAAAAY
easier to level than the druid. Druids are one of easy classes to
level but the Necro and the Mage are MUCH easier. Having your
own personal tank everywhere you go is just too handy.

True the druid can quad, but the places to do this are limited
and it is a technique that is not easy to learn. It takes constant
attention and concentration. With my mage I often go to
the bathroom while my pet finishes a mob. =) Plus I can level
where ever I can single pull.

With quad kiting you have long downtimes between pulls. With
a pet class you can pull almost constantly.

With my pet class I can level in dungeons. Druids can't easily do this.
