But with a max of 50 the game would have no longevity at all.
I was 47 before kunark came out and frankly would have quit had it
not. Being 50 forever with nothing to do but get more loot really made
no sense to me. Kunark came out at just the right time. I am certainly
nothing near a power leveler either since I was only 47 when kunark
came out. I honestly can't understand how the people on old servers
hung around at level 50 for 6 months before that.  I'm 55 now and I
see the option of character growth as being one of the points, without
it I'm done.

50 was even more static and boring though in an already static and
boring game. God, those poor people. They had to do lower guk, solb,
fear, hate and the same 2 dragons over and over again for like 6
months.
