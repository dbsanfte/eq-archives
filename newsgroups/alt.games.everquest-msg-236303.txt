Hi all. Im a new player to EQ and IM having a bit of a problem.  I
bought just the basic game then spent about 5 hours downloading new
updates to it (on cable no less).  I got all the updates expect
Legends, Legacy of Ykesha and GoD.  A person I met in the game said he
wanted to take me to the Bazzaar and took me to a book on a
pedistal(not sure what it was called).  When I clicked on the book it
took me back to my bind point in the same zone.  Supposedly this isnt
supposed to happen. I double checked and 1 of the downloads I got was
the Planes of power that you need to make this work. Any help would be
appreciated.
