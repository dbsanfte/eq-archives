I'm kind of stunned that someone could mention which classes did badly in
the Kunark era and not mention rangers.

On both servers I played, it seemed as if 90% of the high level rangers quit
their rangers in the Kunark era because of their defensive problems.
Consider that rangers were one of the most common classes prior to Kunark
and by the time Velious had rolled around, they were one of the least common
classes as evidence of this.
