Why would anybody remain bound in PoM nowadays?   I can't actually think of
any advantages..

When PoM was first discovered, my guild was one of the first on Prexus to be
there (and pharm it), about 90% of the guild was bound there - but after it
got changed, nobody at all sees any point in PoM, other than going for the
first time, to say.. "I was there"
