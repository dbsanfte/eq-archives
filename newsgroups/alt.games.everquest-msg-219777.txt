6 shadowknights bound in a newbie area right near lots to kill up to 
10th level, with *fast* computers.
Chain HT a red for the kill, suicide, repeat.

At first level they can take something with 40-50 hp easy, by third they 
can drop something with 100+, by 9th they should be able to  take a 
500hp+ mob, provided its not so red it resists more than one HT.

Trying to think of a good bindable zone for this though....hmmm... FoB 
actually. Since you can bind around Kaesora, and there is ample 
appropriate hunting, and an npc right there to suicide on too. If you 
had someone(s) not in the group pulling too, and/or even add a couple 
Nongrouped players to helping to beat it down, and just use HT to do at 
least half the damage and get the kill, the xp group could literally 
blow a HT each every 20-25 seconds. (Assuming you can 'zone' back in 15 
seconds...which a fast PC can do).

Neat thought experiment... relatively pointless. And probably get called 
an exploit by the powers that be. And the last thing SKs need is an HT 
nerf. But its the fastest burst damage output I can think of at that 
level without relying on a hilev damage shield and/or other buffs, and 
it requires no gear at all, and only 15 ish secodns of downtime for 
suicide zoning In theory the xp-group could manage a sustained 4-5 reds 
a minute indefinately... until level 10 when the xp loss and corpse 
recovery kicks in.

The typical super fast leveling I've seen done is with with stackable 
quest items, where you can gain your first 5-10 levels in only minutes 
by turning in stacks of some quest item. Of course, someone had to 
obtain/farm/buy all those quest items.
