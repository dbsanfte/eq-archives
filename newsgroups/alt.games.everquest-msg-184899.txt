I get these crashes in other zones, old world and empty zones (Sth Qeynos
and Neriak Commons to name 2) as well as in the Bazaar. I certainly don't
think it's common enough to be considered a Bandwidth reducer. Maybe happens
once a fortnight when I'm trading (this is 2am - 7pm on trader) I see far
more zone crashes or normal disconnects (that return you to server screen
and then logon) than I do drops to desktop from trading.
If the conspiracy theory was about these drops to server screens being
caused by SOE to reduce bandwidth then I would find that more plausible. The
fact that if they pulled th plug on someones connection that is what would
happen but these desktop crashes are more likely bugs in EQ than some
sinister plot to kick players out of 24/7 trading.
Like I have said, I have had these during normal play.
