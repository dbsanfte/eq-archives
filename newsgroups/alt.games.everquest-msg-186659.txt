 I don't think SoE knows how to make timesinks go away. Look at the
cluster known as the flagging system they unleashed on us. Good idea in
theory but poorly executed. Although the recent changes are nice they
are about 4 months too late for some.

 For those that complain SoE is starting to make everything trivial,
well, they don't have to play that way. If they find enjoyment in
waiting 15 minutes for a boat to show up then waiting 20 more minutes to
get to the other side well hey, they can still do that.
