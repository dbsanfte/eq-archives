Isn't that illegal in most states?

Heh.  This, like the earlier "fixed one of the bugs" wording,
seems to me a bit of a winking joke, but mostly an
admission that in the past they've been too quick to
declare certain chronic problems to be "fixed", only to
find that some of the problem still remained.  Now they're being
more realistic, and announcing that they're at best chipping
away at the problems.

When I make software releases and write the "what's changed"
notes, I've learned to write something like, "fixed a bug
which could cause problem X to occur", and not flatly
declare, "fixed problem X".
