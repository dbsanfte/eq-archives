It's not so people can't macro, it's to make you choose between
artisan and adventurer and make both reasonably viable.  I like it, I
get much more of a sense of accomplishment from my crafting in EQ2
than I ever did in EQ.  Part of that is that the stuff I craft in EQ2
is useful from the beginning, unlike EQ where I never really crafted
anything for my own use except some food, but part of it is that it is
a more involved process.

How is it not possible?  AFAIK, it's perfectly possible to solo all
the way to 50, you just have to do it in the right place, and it won't
give as good rewards as grouping.  But it can be done, and if some
class (scouts or mages, I'd guess) can't, I'm sure they will fix it.

That said, I don't understand why they hide solo mobs in dungeons
behind the aggressive group mobs, and I think they should make it so
one or two people could solo entrance areas in dungeons while waiting
to find a group in the dungeon.  But on the whole I think grouping
should be required for the good stuff, so I don't mind much.

This is really stupid.

One argument is that EQ2 has higher graphics demands, which makes it
harder to load things on the go.  It's also easier to implement a game
with zones, which translates to more resources to spend on other
things, and it lets you instance zones on demand, thus supporting a
larger population per server.

None of which means it isn't annoying and immersion-breaking, of
course.
