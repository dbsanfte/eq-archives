Yep, DX 9.0b or whatever didn't make a difference.  I even repatched the
default directory under uifiles.  In the end, the fact that the targeted PC
or NPC's name starts flashing is probably more than enough.  Sometimes our
LDoN puller has issues and isn't great about saying when to assist him.  I
just need to make sure that when I assist him the mob that gets targeted is
the one he brought back.
