I would like a bit more info on  this, please.

My 60 rogue has never camped Hadden, and has a FBE  from a friend.
Was a gift for raiding Phinny for Kedge robe.

My now 44 rogue would like one, too.  I seem to remember seeing
the camp in QHills, before, but would like some more information.

What level is Hadden? Does he have friends nearby? Would those
friends aggro a level 44 rogue if he attempted to kill Hadden?

I really like earning my own gear, and am a bit of a masochist about
it (come on, 2 rogues on the same account?  ).  Any helpful info
would be appreciated.
