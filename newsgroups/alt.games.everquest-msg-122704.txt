Fish rolls are definitely one way to go, but for cheap and fast/easy,
making fillets was, in my experience, even faster and cheaper.  Trick is
getting a fillet knife. If you know a smith with even moderate skill,
they can knock one out very easily.  I made one myself starting with
zero smith skill and it didnt' take long.

Then go to Thurgadin and go into the meat shop. There's an oven right
there in the shop. (That's the easy part.) Then just start buying stacks
of bear meat. Combine one meat with the fillet knife and you make a bear
fillet. Like the fish rolls, you get a lot of failures at first, but
once you get up past a skill of sixty or so and make them reliably, you
not only don't lose much money, you actually begin turning a small
profit. The fillets sell back to the vendor for a bit more than the meat
cost. They will take you to a skill of 143, so it's a slight advantage
over fish rolls there, too.

Of course, the resulting fillets are not a banquet like fish rolls, and
aren't especially light weight, so that's not the answer for the OP, but
if he wants to master baking fast and cheap to then go make fish rolls,
this is another option.
