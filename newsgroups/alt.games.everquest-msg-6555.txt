	Your gonna like working with a Necro.  They are a very good
solo class pre 50.  Like everyone said dark,fear and send in the pet.
A few dots will speed it up.  Your Drain life spells keep your hp high
and your allure keeps you off your butt.  You can hunt the same things
you hunted with a druid.  At 22-23 you can do the Miller and at 35
switch over to Dwarfs.  Souldnt take more than a month or so to get to
50.  After that its alot slower,  while others start to get stronger
by leaps and bounds,  your main function turns to a very unatural mana
battery.  whooppee.....
