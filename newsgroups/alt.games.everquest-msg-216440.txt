Agreed!  I go along with whatever the group decides.  I'm not doing LDoN
because of the loot.  I'm mainly doing it to advance my lesser characters and
get them some group experience.  (OTOH, it's my 57 ranger that's been
approached by two guilds after LDoN adventures.  My ranger couldn't join a
guild.  She truly prefers solitude.  It's my BF who's after the group
experience.)
