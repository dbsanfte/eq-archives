Hmm, especially as a (mainly non-raiding) shaman, I'd disagree with
that. ... at least once you hit the Torpor/Cann5 level. The affliction
focus items got nerfed into almost uselessness since they no longer
work with slow/root/malo. Having an extra tick on your poison DoTs
isn't exactly uber, although I will pull out my coldain military
wristguard if I'm DoTing often (which is pretty rare these days). 
ODS (mana preservation 3) is still pretty useful but I'd be hard
pressed to justify it over an upgrade with 100hp. These days I run out
of Hitpoints a lot more often than I run out of mana. The only focus
item I wouldn't give up for a 100hp upgrade is my wicked bone Atlatl.
That really is a useful effect, even if the only spell it worked with
was Torpor. 

None of the other normal focus affects even come close, the only ones
that I can think of are off of raid lvl mobs anyway.
