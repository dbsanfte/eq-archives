Hi all,
Was thinking of a return to EQ after close to a two year break.  Anyone have
an idea what the youngest server is?  And if so, how long it's been live?
Probably won't bother unless the server is relatively new, but oh well all
other MMOG's relesed since EQ blow, so I figured I'd come back. :)
