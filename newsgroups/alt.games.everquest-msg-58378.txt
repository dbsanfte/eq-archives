We are trying to start a guild on the Bertoxx server that will have a bit of
roleplaying in it.  Though we are developing this guild for our role-play
needs it isn't required of the members.  Just a nice safe haven for those
who grow weary of the businesslike ways of most guilds, and want to chat and
play.  We have rules and the such, but nothing too hard to follow.  We want
FUN, FUN, FUN....and adventure!  Got to have that too:)

We accept all races, from the drunk beer brawling dwarf, to the rash
infected ogres, haughty elves and cold iksars.  Diversity makes one able to
handle the various drinks of many cities!

If anyone would be interested in helping form this guild, Way of the Leaf,
please visit the following link: http://communities.msn.com/WayoftheLeaf
It may look a little hap-hazard at the moment while we get it all
organized:)  Or for more information email me at:
mogginproudfeet@hotmail.com

Safe journeys to you all and may the hair on your feet grow thick and long.

Moggin Proudfeet
Halfling Druid
