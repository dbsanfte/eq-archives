No farming for jewelcraft.  Just park in front of a merchant with
about 10k and go to town.  

When they added the tradeskill container summon thingy to the trophys,
I decided I had to have one.  My chosen tradeskill is tinkering, but I
was a long way away from grandmaster.  I sacrificed about 3 XP
sessions and raised JC from 105 to 250.  I spent less than 5k, because
I was using a geerlok gemsetter and enchanting all the metal.  

If you just want to summon bags, I reccomend jewelcraft.

I enjoy them.  Mostly because it used to be a way to be unique.  Not
many people did tradeskills, and when someone tracks you down because
they need rebreathers or want rare wyvern hide armor for their shaman;
well, it felt  good to stand out.

This has been taken away somewhat recently by a) making most
tradeskills easier to master than they were, and b) putting quests in
that force people who wouldn't otherwise give a sheet to raise
tradeskills.  


I see value in making grandmasters rare.  But I don't see how this can
be accomplished if anyone can grandmaster a tradeskill in a reasonable
amount of time.  Sadly, there isn't a way to make it truly skill
based, so Verent has decided to rely on tedium to weed out the
unfaithful.  A lot of the tedium has already been removed from many
tradeskills.  Remove more and you won't be able to swing a dead cat
without hitting a grandmaster.
