Just the componants needed to convert to natural gas and be safe in a
vehicle would most likely be more expensive than $600. A storage
container that is crash rated, metering jets for fuel delivery to the
cylinders and any electronic chip mods needed along with high pressure
heat resistant tubing/hoses would most likely be a couple of thousand.
I'm sure there is more needed that I haven't even considered. This
conversion is not something that I would want to scavenge parts for
:-)

Contacting them would give you an idea of what it would cost to have a
conversion installed.
