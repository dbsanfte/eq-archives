Depends on budget.

My Geoforce 4 Ti4200 does pretty well, but still sees some video related lag
in tough situations. Most of the time, it's great though. Much cheaper than
a 4600 is or the ATi 9700 for that matter.

If you're going to be doing editing, and are willing to spend in that $300
range, I'd go for the ATi 9700 Pro. Down in the $200's, I'd probably go with
the 9700 or the Goeforce 4 Ti4600.

Memory - a big thing with EQ. Going as high as 1GB really DOES make a
difference. Going from 256 to 512 is huge.
