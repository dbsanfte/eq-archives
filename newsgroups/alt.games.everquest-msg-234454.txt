The confusion is understandable.  The monk epic as originally coded as very
hard for iksar monks to do due to faction issues.  Because of this, some
time later the Iksar Shackle quest was extended to a pretty much epic item;
it's been called the 'Iksar Epic' in more than one place.  This monk may be
working on this 'second monk epic' quest.  It's a scary one; the final
turn-in is to Cazic Thule himself, in the Plane of Fear!

Lest anyone think it's impossible, though, I personally helped a guildie
monk with BOTH - Sono was the only double-epic monk I ever met, but it can
be done!
