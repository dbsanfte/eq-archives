I made it at lvl 1 without trouble, but it was scary.  You should have
seen the post on the Sony forum about a lvl 70 character (Paladin I
think it was) who bitched and whined for someone to Invis him and
escort him, to show him where the Stone was, roflmao.  He didn't want
a 'loc' because "loc is for noobs" according to him  :D  When everyone
laughed at him in /ooc, he said words to the effect of "Ok, I'm going
by myself, but if I die I will come back here and make your lives a
misery".  He was just laughed at again, as if he can't even find the
PoK Stone he has no chance of finding anyone in a zone he's terrified
of getting lost in. So funny.
