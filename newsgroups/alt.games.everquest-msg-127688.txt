Aye, but monks were soloing past 50 in Sol B long before
Velks even existed.  Beat down a kobold (or higher level
mob at higher levels), bind to half (then later to 70%),
mend, and be back ready to fight.  Mend would usually be
back up before the next solo fight was done, and if all
else fails, just FD and heal.

Warriors were sort of the same, although their strat was
to just bind to half (and later to 70%), then fight again.
No downtime healing needed.

Without some sort of good high-damage weapon and
THEN some sort of increased healing mechanism,
rogues couldn't do either.  We could take down a solid
blue sonic bat, but then have to bind to half (and later
to 70%), and THEN sneak/hide and sit to heal back
to 100%.

Finishing fights almost exclusively at 20% health when
starting from 100% means that you HAVE to wait, unless
long CRs are fun for playing and getting exp.  The RNG
can just go against you sometimes, and I can't tell you the
number of times I've stood at the zone as a solo rogue
thinking that if this kobold didn't turn to run soon (and stop
hitting me), it'd be 3 minutes wasted 'cause I had to zone.
That's not including binding/healing time to start again.
