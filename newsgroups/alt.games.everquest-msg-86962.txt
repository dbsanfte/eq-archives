From the tests I've seen, JBoots are a 35% speed increase (over
unassisted running speed), while AA Run 3 is a 30% speed increase
(AA Run 1 = 10%, AA Run 2 = 20%).

So JBoots are still a tad faster, but hardly enough to notice
(135/130 = 3.8% difference).

However, it'll take you quite a long time to earn 3 AA points at
your level, and the JBoots may come in very handy between now and then.

And you *will* want the AA Run 3:  Unlike JBoots, AA Run 3 works
forever, even inside dungeons (you can click your JBoots just
before you enter a dungeon to keep the effect on for a while,
but you can't refresh it inside a dungeon once it wears off).
Plus AA Run 3 will help you even on naked corpse runs, JBoots
won't (since they'll be on your corpse).

Convert your Ring of the Ancients to a pair of JBoots, they'll
be much more valuable to you than INT+5 will be for tradeskills,
especially when you can get nearly the same INT by spending a little
money (or time) acquiring the INT+3 Bracelet of Woven Grass
(Upper Guk), or Polished Bone Bracelet (from Evil Eyes).
