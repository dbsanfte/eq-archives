It was exactly what I thought it was gonna be -- one-sided shite trying to
play on people's 'fears'.

I don't mean to trivialize anyone's death, but it's pretty obvious the young
man in question had other troubles aside from the 'addiction' to EverQuest.

I am no psychiatrist, but it seems to me the mother's own guilt over her
inability to prevent her son's suicide is causing her to use EQ as her
scapegoat. She need to go into therapy.
