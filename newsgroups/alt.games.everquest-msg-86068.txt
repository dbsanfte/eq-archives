Forget clock speeds - forget ANYTHING YOU HEAR. I own them all...

in my opinion AMD COMPLETELY SUCKS LIKE HELL.

why... read the official everquest forums - many have noticed EQ performs -
or rather UNDERPERFORMS at time in EQ.

There are MANY programs where my AMD computers run much faster than the
INTEL counterparts but it seems the TWO programs I use the most (Everquest,
and a video editing program for making movies) both have MINOR issues with
AMD chips.

AMD is great if you dont want to make movies with a card from PINNACLE
SYSTEMS and dont want toplay EVERQUEST fluidly.

try searching the official everquest for the word AMD - you will see... YOU
WILL SEE !!!!

AMD SUXXOR for me...
