There are still some real newbies out there, like me.  One of the things I
tried to do before starting EQ for the first time was read the newsgroups
and websites to educate myself.  I learned from reading that begging was an
absolute NO.  I have however found that by just collecting some of the stuff
from monsters I was killing anyway I could make very nice money from high
levels without begging.  I spent 5 levels collecting silk and bone chips
which I sold to higher levels.  I now have a complete set of padded leather
armor and all my spells and a few plats in the bank and I (hopefully) never
pissed anyone off in the process.  Hopefully some beggars out there will
read this and take my advice.  To you high levels out there that go out of
your way to help people like me with advice and overpaying for stacks of
chips/silks, this newbie salutes you.
