/agree.  I can see something along this line:

[Enter a management meeting at SOE]

a_manager_01: "What kind of call takes up the most of our CS time?"
a_manager_02: "Accoring to this report generated by our Call Tracking
Software(tm), it seems that we have a high volume of tickets related to bag
switches. People either getting ripped off, or losing stuff trying to do
them in a corner of the PoK."
a_manager_01: "Hmmm ... if we could eliminate these, we might be able to
whack an FTE from CS. How could we do that?"
a_manager_02: "I know! We could give 'em a shareable bank slot!"
a_manager_01: "Write it up and get it to development."

[fade to commercial]

But I'm a cynical sonofabitch ......
