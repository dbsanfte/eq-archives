Ok, lets see

Patch message: February 10, 2004

- The beastlord epic weapon will no longer "proc" for wielders below
the 46th level.

their words, not mine...  The beastlord epic weapon... They may have
never called them that... but they are calling them that now..

but in the end, I don't care what they call the item... the point is,
other epics are hard to get, so is the zerker...  why does the zerker
epic outshine the others...   and if you use the justification that
its  a new class that needs the incentive... then why did it not
happen for the beast epic.  

oh well... all this will change nothing...  its all an opinion
