I feel sorry for you.  I feel sorry for anyone that knows you.  Your outlook is
so poor that you must radiate negativity.

Either divorce the spouse or get a new job.  Whatever is making you such a
grump must really have a hold on you.


Someday ......eventually........I hope that you become a nice person.
