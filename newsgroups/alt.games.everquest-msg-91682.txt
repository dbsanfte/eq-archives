For anyone under level 52 or so, it's worth about 100p.  At level 56 I
cringe when I have to accept a 49 rez.  I can't remember the last time I had
to pay for a rez, but I've always been willing.

If a stranger has to travel to rez me, I'm going to force payment on him.
On the flipside, if I happen to be playing my brother's 59 cleric I'm going
to demand payment for the hassle.  I rarely accept payment anymore
otherwise, usually only when I'm broke.

Yup!  And I see nothing at all wrong with it, though many people might.  I
rez for free because I'm a guild leader and doing crap like this is good
publicity for the guild but it sure would be nice to start accepting payment
again...with my druid on one computer, my enchanter on another, and my
brother's cleric on my third...first-rate paramedic service!  All I need to
make it perfect would be to buy a high level necro and figure out where I'd
put my fourth computer (sitting on the floor unused) and I'd be a
full-service paramedic service. <g>
