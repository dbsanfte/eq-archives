rogue 15/20 piercer
monk/dru/bst bracer (50hp one)
some shoulders

We used 1 group to kill the initial mob, then I pulled the bubbling(?) onto
the land for killing.  None of us had ANY clue about the fight, no idea how
many waves, what they hit for, how many mobs at a time, what the boss hit
for, how many HP he had.. we didn't know how many of them were rooted.

I was leading it (more like barking directions which I just hoped proved
right) and things went fine.. we had a guildie come down to join us though,
and his invis poofed 10 steps away from us (agroing all the slimes behind
us) which threw a nice train on us.

The mob was at 10% or so and I get a /tell "hurry up there, Tormax is up!!"
and that last 10% was painfully slow.. he sure does have a lot of hp.   Was
my first time exping there (we went specifcally for the RoS) and then got
Tormax right after (which was the fastest clearing of tormy room/wingmen
that ive ever seen)

Somebody is selling one of those bracers, and an AoW helm.... 300k+ lol
