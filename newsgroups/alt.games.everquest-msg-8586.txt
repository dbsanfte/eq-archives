What bluescreens (I assume the windows protection error here)? Does it only
go blue with EQ or also with other games? Does it BS if you just let your pc
running stationary (ie I had a problem with a swap file once, just letting
my pc run for a couple of hours would bs it)? Does it start up all right or
are error messages created? What OS do you use? What have you tried to find
the problem?

Just a few questions which would help.
