That brings up another question. And I'm really hoping I haven't played
2+ years with a total misunderstanding of this.  But it deals with how
invis and the mob's aggro/hate list work together.

It was my impression that, once you were on a mob's hate list (had
aggro'd it) that invis would not work on that mob for as long as you
were on the list. So let's say you have Mob_01 and Mob_02 standing
together. You'd like to kill them, but you can't solo them both. The
problem is, that if you run up and aggro Mob_01, he will share his aggro
with Mob_02 and they will *both* come scampering merrily along to chat
with you about ruining their homelands, etc.

Now, if you suddenly start clicking on your CoS and turning invis, since
the hate list has been shared, won't they *both* still keep following
you? And if you FD successfully, then they're both going to stop anyway.
You have to be standing to cast a spell, right, so it's not like you can
just stand up and click CoS because you'll be back on the hate list
agin, no?

Not to mention that this brings into play the problem of the higer level
SK and Necro using this. You're probably fighting all mobs who are above
level 35 by then, and they always have a chance of remembering you after
the FD, yes?

The more I think about this, the more useless this extremely expensive
items seems for the necros and SK's, particularly at higher levels.
Again, if  a warrior or monk could use it, it would be heaven, I'm sure. 

So why do the necro and SK web sites seem to literally *scream* that you
MUST go get a pre-nerf CoS?
