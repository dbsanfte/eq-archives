And you don't need a high level Rogue to do it, either.

When my rogue hit level 11 (he didn't practice at level 10), I went to
practice his pick lock skill on the entrance to Paineel (that door is easier
than the one in Befallen!!)  When his pick lock skill was maxed out, for fun
I went and tried the lock to the Hole.... worked every time with a skill of
only 60.

My only question is:  do you need the key to get OUT of the Hole?
