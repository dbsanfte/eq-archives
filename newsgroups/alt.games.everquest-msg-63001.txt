It figures, as an old guy, I just get to liking a game(EverQuest) and was
trying a 10 day trial and bam, I get kicked off by a patch and I'm not
com.literate enough to fix it. By the way , I was doing pretty good using
"Starband" satellite connection on a client machine. By the time they fix
it, my 10 days will be gone.
