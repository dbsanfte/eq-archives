Well, I have one exception to that. :) I was standing at the docks in 
Freeport and noticed a person of the highly anon type.  I couldn't decide 
for sure if she was a caster or not (think she turned out to be a ranger) 
so I asked her before claritying.  It turned out a guildmate of hers was 
in the zone, and she was gonna sneak up and go "boo!" :)  So I grouped up 
and invised her too. :)

Of course, she may have been pulling my chain, but it was at least a good 
story.
