A ranger with his archery DPS cut in half is still ten times better than a
monk with ton po's (and that may be an understatement, I don't have ton po's
yet, but every ranger of my level can have an elemental bow, a nice arrow,
and all the archery AAs to make that a viable method of soloing).

Hell, I'm not sure that a monk with ton po's can outdamage the regen of an
exp mob...
