Best thing to do: get yourself a sewing kit, and start killin spiders! Get all the
spider silks you can, and combine 2 of em to make silk swatches. Sell the swatches
for coin (usually around 1pp per swatch, sometimes more). Then find a smith player
and buy banded armor (AT MOST 1 pp per AC point). Also go to Eruds Crossing and
kill wisps if you have a magic weapon, with a shammy friend as a healer. Either
sell the greater lightstones for ypp each or so, or take each of them to North
Karana and give to the gypsy vendor there (name starts with an M). She'll give you
some exp for each GLS, and also a book/container for caster research that can be
sold to any vendor for as much as 10pp each!

If this is too tuff, then REALLY simple: KILL BEARS! HQ bear hides sell for up to
40pp on most servers and arent that hard to get! After you get a few hundred PP
banked, its EASY to buy some rather decent low level gear!

Have fun!
