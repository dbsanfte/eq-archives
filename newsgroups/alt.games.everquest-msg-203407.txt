Cleric sounds like a class I would like.  The times I most enjoy
my Druid is when I'm buffing and healing my groupmates.  It would
be hard for me to give up soloing when the mood strikes me though.
Unless I'm underestimating the ability of Clerics to solo.

Of course I could always play multiple characters.  Duh...  :)

I promise I won't think Clerics can almost always find groups
anymore.  And I didn't notice you ranting - I only noticed well
articulated replies with experience to back up your comments!
