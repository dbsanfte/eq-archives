Well you see, we have VERY different views on what "minimal" forces means =)
(I did say in my original post though, that it only refers to 3 people)

Both mobs unslowed? Refering to Aulife and Ice?  1 being immune to slow, the
other not, kinda makes a difference =)

Key part of your sentence:- "the healers don't use CH"

When using small forces, Cheal is not just preferential, but its often
*required*.  SR is a very mana intensive spell in comparison (in terms of
raw mana usage, and mana to heal ratio), and of course SL is out of the
question (same range as cheal).. yes taking into consideration healing gift
and adept too (which I guess gives more bang for the buck on the faster
heals... 17k cheals are no better than 10k cheals etc)

For small raids, where mana and numbers are a problem, spamming SR is most
definately not an option.  You have to go with CH, and think of a way to
handle his spin stun (pretty easy, when you are aware of it)

Maybe 4 real healers is a norm for a raid the size that Lief is proposing, I
don't know. (Druids and clerics are equal in examples like this)... we do it
with 2, 2-boxed, which imo is the smallest "safe" number that can be used.

Same deal for fire, cept in this case the 3boxed shaman heals the rampage
tank (me, im too lazy to try and set pet on ramp nowadays), and earth.

In saying all that, I've watched raids of 20 peeps with 4 clerics wipe on
Aulife.. so /shrug
