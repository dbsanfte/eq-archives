This actually has very little to do with the problem.

The real problem is zone overcrowding, due to Verant's complete lack of
sense in creating the Bazaar in the frist place. It can be alleviated by
making a few settings changes on your client.

1.) using the filters in your options, turn off anything you don't need,
like bardsong <violent shiver> and NPC spells.

2.) turn off any graphics you don't need, like spell effects. Whether you
turn them back on when you leave the bazaar is up to you.

3.) switch to overhead mode so less data is being sent to your machine, it's
actually easier to function in the bazaar this way anyway and it cuts lag
massively.

4.) If you have a bazaar trader on a second account that you leave there a
lot, reduce the graphics even further by turning all models off, setting
textures to low quality in the EQ Options before you log into the client,
turning off dynamic lighting, etc.
