If you just need to go to Freeport, and dont care about seeing the zones,
get a port. I tried to run from Freeport to Qeynos with my level 16 rogue
to help a friend get started.
First, i didnt know about Kith (you can NOT cross it at night, someone
claims you can hug the wall, sometimes work, other times level 50+ people
die from it. Crossing Kith at night is ALL about luck, seen a level 1
halfling druid follow the road from Rivervale to WC without gettting
attacked), so died there.
Then i reached EK, and with those "funny" mountain roads with bandits that
are HARD to aviod, its not a good place to me. Managed to survive that
because a high level guy helped me.
Then got killed my Sir Morgan (stupid Mask of Desception).
Then i got a port from Freeport to NK instead, got my corpse in EK, ran to
Qeynos. A LOT faster, and a lot safer.
If you can afford a port (and can find a porter in the area), get a port to
WC instead.
