Been proven on Enchanters.  Lots and lots of logs on Castersrealm ages
ago.  Cha affects resist, resist is checked every tick.  You need a lot
of cha to make much difference though.  Something like 10 cha = 1% less
resist IIRC.  Of course if you are going against a low resist low con
mob it's not going to make much difference. Say your resist chance is 2%
against a blue mob, with 100 more cha that would become 1.8%.  But since
those resists are every tick, it adds up to a shorter duration pretty
fast, I'm not feeling up to doing the math right now, but it's quite
noticeable.  If you try charming something even or better you will see
significant differences (of course your charm won't last long anyway
since you are proabably pretty high resist percentage).
