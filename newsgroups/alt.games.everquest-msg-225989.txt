First pain inflicted puts you at the top of the hate list.  Everyone else
has to top you now, and with your DPS that can be a tall order.

Good peeling tactic.  I might add Flame Lick to that ... it's the ranger's
Quicker-Pisser-Offer. ;-)

That might help you .... slow you down enough to keep dual wield going
instead of having to switch to 2HS.  Also, don't kick if you're doing it as
a part of your DPS package.  Again, since you've drawn first blood, you're
at the top of the hate list.  Every point after that hurts if you're trying
to dump aggro.

I know, I know.  But it's also a skill you'll need if you solo on up into
your 50's, when you need Swarmcaller for the slow.  Another option would be
to get a Silver Swiftblade for your 2HS ... they're cheap (around 50 plat in
the bazaar on CT), have a delay of 24, and may let you ride the ragged edge
of keeping/losing aggro.  I use mine for quick 2HS skillups, and rarely
catch aggro with it.  It's not as much fun being the "Whirling Cuisinart of
Doom" as my ranger is called, but it may help. ;-)
