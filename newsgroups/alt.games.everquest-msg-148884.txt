Is it some custom for people who don't use english as a main language
to always use multiple ?'s or !'s? One does it. :p Anyway, a good one
to buy and resale might be Blue Diamonds. Some people just wanna chuck
them for any price because they are useless except to jewelers so if
you find them for like 400-600 or even lower buy them. I always see
people on bazaar saying over and over they will buy BD's for a way
jacked up price if you bring them straight to them so as long as
you're a wizard you are well off. The last time I tried this was when
they PCed at 500 and I saw people offering to buy like that for 1k. If
you have a few thousand platinum to start with you might make a mint
on this, since everyone likes the resistance gear it makes.
