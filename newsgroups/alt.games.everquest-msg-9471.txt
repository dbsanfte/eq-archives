Before you begin you need to make sure that you have the latest
drivers for the Radeon ready to install. You can find the latest
shipping ATI drivers for Windows98/ME at the following URL:
http://support.ati.com/drivers/winme/winme_radeon_4137075_directx.html
Once you have DL'd the drivers double click on the install file.
(wme_radeon_4_13_7075.exe). It will extract the drivers to the
following location: C:\ATI\support\WME_RADEON_4_13_7075.

IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT INSTALL THE DRIVERS AT THIS TIME. When you run the
*.exe file it will automatically attempt to install the drivers.
Cancel out of the install. Your goal here is to get the drivers into a
location on your harddrive that you can use later.

Removing the old drivers and installing the new ones:

You must first make sure that the old video card built into the Compaq
PC is disabled. Boot up your PC and go into setup. You usually have to
hit F10 or DEL, or some other key combination. Once in the setup menus
you will have to figure out if you can disable or turn off the onboard
video. If you are not sure how to do this, you may have to call Compaq
or check thier support website for information.
http://www.compaq.com/support/

Now you are ready to remove all of the old drivers and install the new
Radeon drivers.

First;
START->SETTINGS->CONTROL PANEL->ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS. 
Look for anything related to your old (and the new) video card and
remove it. I don't know what you old card is, but it is most likely
made by ATI. Remove any programs associated with ATI or that have
Display Driver in the title. If it asks you to reboot say NO.

Next:
Right-Click on the Desktop and choose PROPERTIES. Go to the settings
tab and click the ADVANCED button. Open the ADAPTER tab and click the
CHANGE button. Select STANDARD VGA for adapter type, and click OK
until you exit the properties menu. DO NOT REBOOT.

Finally:
Right-Click on MY COMPUTER and choose PROPERTIES. Select the DEVICE
MANAGER tab. Look for DISPLAY ADAPTERS and expand the tree structure.
DELETE any adapters that you see.

This should completely remove any old drivers, and setup your PC to
use the default VGA driver that all video cards can use for 16 color
at 640x480.

REBOOT

When your PC reboots it should auto-detect your Radeon. When it asks
for the location of the drivers point to the directory with the
drivers you have downloaded from the net.
(C:\ATI\support\WME_RADEON_4_13_7075\ATIDRIVE)

After the new driver loads you will be asked to reboot one final time.

That should do it. Good luck!!
