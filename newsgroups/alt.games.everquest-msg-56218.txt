Evening,

I've been reading a lot about the various online RPGs and it seems that
Everquest is the one most people think is the best.  However getting hold of
a copy of the game in the UK is proving incredibly difficult!

Rumour has it that the game was given away free on the front of a gaming
magazine in the US, is this also the case in the UK, and if so does anyone
know which magazine?

Alternatively does anyone know of anywhere that still stocks this elusive
game?  Ideally I'd like 2 copies of the collectors edition pack so that I
get all the expansion packs and a friend and I can play at the same time.

Many thanks,

Simon
