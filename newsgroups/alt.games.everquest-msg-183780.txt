Nope, and for one big reason:  the alliance of two guilds (Crimson Twilight,
Winter's Light, commonly called CT/WL) that I'm a part of is the *only*
place they'd be able to recruit from then.  No one else is even close to
taking down Agnarr et. al.  They already tried sneaky recruiting tactics
within CT/WL, and it worked - they got three people to leave us and join
them.  However, I'm fairly certain those three will be the only three that
go - everyone else in the alliance seemed pretty disgusted with their
recruiting tactics.  Keep in mind that almost everyone in CT/WL meet the
uberguild's recruiting requirements and could have gone to them at any time,
but hasn't.  And that's almost entirely because of the uberguild's
reputation.

Good points.  That's probably what is, indeed, happening.  They *do* make
publically available what mobs they are killing every day (in a plain-text
format, with no details provided, just that on day X mob Y was killed) and a
lot of the names aren't familiar to me.

LOL... now there's some folks with some serious inadequacy issues to deal
with.  =)

Indeed, that is one of the two.  It is now privately admitted by many
uberguild members that his post on the FoH boards was a huge fiasco.  While
one or two will mumble about how the thread was led off-topic by enemies of
the uberguild, most just want to forget that the whole thing ever happened.
And I don't blame them.  =)
