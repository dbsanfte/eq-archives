Yup typical shite attitude from many guilds. If you've got a raid force
capable of doing it and say you are just waiting for some last stragglers,
and some other guild zones in and beats you to it I've noticed they don't
see anything wrong with it. Why the fuck not?  An attitude I don't like, but
have to live with, an attitide that thankfully isn't completely prevalent.

Cheers
