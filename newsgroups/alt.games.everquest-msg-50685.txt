Hiya, not too far beyond you (39) - anyway...

'kiting', the way I've been doing it anyway, has a couple of variations

quad/multi-kiting which becomes viable at 34 when you get lightning strike,
is just the same old snare/(repeat snare on multiple mobs - up to 4 since
lightning strike can only hit up to 4 mobs in close proximity) run to get
distance and cast - repeat until the mob(s) is(are) dead.  The spell at 34 I
think starts out at 182 dmg so it's a good wallop.

Root n' Rot - nuking breaks root, thus nukes should only be used as
finishing moves in this sort of attack.  Simple really, I always snare first
because it lasts a good while and when root does break I don't want the mob
coming at me full speed whilst I med.  As the mob chases me I lay down
drones and immolate then root it in place - and med.  Repeat the root/dots
as needed and usually finish with careless lightning or some quick melee.
Keep terrorize animal loaded for dealing with 'animal' type NPC's as you can
just fear them rather than burning mana on roots and I think TA takes a bit
less mana - *I think* - the logic being of course the dots will again do
full damage on a feared/rooted mob.

As has mine, in fact I think it's near 200 or very close.  This is a good
thing for me because Alteration covers things like SoW and some other buffs
(I think) as well as root and snare - my bread and butter.  Taken as a
whole, DoT's and the conjuration discipline don't make up the majority of my
castings - nor does the evocation discipline related spell lines.  On blue
things anymore at 39 I *expect* a ton of resists/breaks on ensaring roots
but just love that 88pt damage it does when it sticks - even if its a short
while and having that as my specialization means I use very LITTLE mana when
I have to keep recasting it.  It has just kept getting better the more I
level.

Isn't healing Alter.?

Believe what people tell you when they say at 34 you'll start feeling more
of the druid's real power.
