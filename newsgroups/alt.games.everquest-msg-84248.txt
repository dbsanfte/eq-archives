Thanks. Much shorter and clearer than I'd managed. But even the ones who
read the boards/mail religiously still need it. (Of course, they tend to
be the ones who are really heavily involved and there's no need to tell
*them* that having guild chat on is a Good Thing (tm). It may be a
foreign concept to people who've never had the guild experience, but
there are also smaller things that just don't get planned. Might be a
normal xp group/hunting night, but suddenly two groups of people wind up
near the same area, and somebody realizes they could go knock of a lower
piece of their epic. Like maybe Reavers in CoM or something. If the
manpower is online and not otherwise tied up, it gets formed up and
happens. 

If you have folks who never have any interest in communicating, and
never seem to show up to help guildies when these opportunities arise,
even if they do manage to remain in the guild they shouldn't be shocked
when nobody comes rushing to help them when *their* rare spawn pops.
