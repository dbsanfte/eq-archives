I've got an Nvidia 16MB TNT2 M64 PRO Graphics card. 256mb memory, 1.1 Gh
Athlon Chip. I was just disappointed, after I went out and upped the memory
on it. It was like running chest deep through molasses in December. Don't
know about the bitpixel setting. I'll check it, never even thought about
that.

thanks!
