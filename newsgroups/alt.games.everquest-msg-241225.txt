I also am having problems targeting. When I go to melee a mob, it disappears
then shows up in front of me out of target range. I get the message ( target
out of range get closer) I get closer and its jump out in front of me out of
range again. whats up with this. I have updated everything to SOE specs.
Anyone have ay ideas how to fix this or is it a bug SOE needs to deal with.
