Ten percent hell, I'd pay 50%... because at the moment I either sell to
vendors (who pay what, 10cp on the pp?) or end up auctioning it
at half whatever the going rate seems to be in order to dump it fast.

My broker friend on my previous server made over 2kpp off of
commissions from me alone before he hit 10th level, and further
like any good broker, used -my- money to further his own business
ends; while waiting for me to come pick up my 1k cut off a sale item,
he'd use it to invest in the GLS market, buying em whenever people
offered em at low prices and doing the quest in order to turn em
into 9pp and fat exp for himself.  As he was a caster, and spending
his spare time while auctioning chain casting his spells on himself,
he wasn't even hurting himself by not getting skill advances while
leveling.

Now personally, this isn't my cup of tea at all, but there are people
who love this sort of thing, he was one, you seem to be another....
if only I could find one on Morel Thule!  Ah well, it sounds like
Verant is putting people like the two of you out of business now
with the release of Luclin, which I would consider a pity, except
that I can't find one of you!
