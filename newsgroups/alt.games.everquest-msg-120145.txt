A rather clear and direct admission that you are indeed a "rules
lawyer".

Several of these rules of conduct quite clearly require interpretation,
as is common with any "rules" intended to govern human behavior.

Why on God's green earth would anybody want to create anything
resembling the ever-growing cancer that is our RL legal system
in a gaming environment intended for "fun".  Pull your head out
of your ass, breathe a little fresh air, stop searching for ways
ways to scam the system, and try actively cooperating with the
intent of the game designers for a change.

What would be "great" would be for the game to be able to detect
adolescent self-righteous attitudes like yours automaticly and funnel
you off to a restricted server populated only by people like you.
I hear exactly the same sort of nitpicky "but you didn't say I couldn't
do [something nearly identical to prohibited behavior]" bullshit from my
twelve-year old daughter.  I look forward to the day you come here
posting a whiny rant about how unfair it was that you were suspended
and/or banned for doing something the wasn't specificly prohibited
down to the last detailed keystroke despite it being so obviously in
violation of the spirit of the game that Verant invokes rule #11 on
your self-serving arrogant ass.
