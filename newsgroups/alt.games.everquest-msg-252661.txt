Thats not the same thing as what he's saying.

Take for example my mage; a HOT that nearly doubled my ability to keep a 
pet alive for a good many levels and never gets replaced, and a haste/hp 
buff that was an extremely marginal upgrade at its level and is outdated 
almost immediately.

Which is better?  The lower level one.

Firebolt of Tallon, 61 bolt style DD, versus Black Steel, 62 DS (or is 
it 63?).  More DPS, same ratio, barely higher casting time, much longer 
range.  Firebolt generally the better spell, yet lower level.


Heck, look at clerics; they get a stun at level 5 which casts fastest 
of all their stuns for a long long time, is always cheapest on mana, 
doesn't do any damage, which quadruples its usefulness.  For a very very 
long time (till somewhere over 60) they keep getting stuns but none are 
worth half what that first one is.   Lower level spell, but better.

DA or DB (actually I hear they improved DB so it might actually be 
better these days, sure wasn't back when I was a cleric)

Flash of Light, or Blinding Luminescence?

Snare or Ensnare?  (Ok, here Ensnare arguably has the edge in many 
situations)

I'm sure the NG can think of lots more examples

Splendid
