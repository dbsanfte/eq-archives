Got squished there by faydedar.
I thought it was a triggered spawn, so I came back with my druid, running
across the ocean while using track, and its still there, noone seems to be
aware of it.
Either its spawning randomly now, or someone spawned it and left.
The new skelly that spawns in that room talks of the water dragon, so maybe
verant are making that room unuseable. Maybe this will make us all go out
and buy POP so we can still port around?

Does faydedar see through invis/camo? I was figuring I could still use it if
I get someone to invis me as im gating.
