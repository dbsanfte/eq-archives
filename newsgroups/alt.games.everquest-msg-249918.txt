No, he won't attack things wandering by, however, he will also stay put and not
wander off...  And, when you do engage a mob, after the battle, instead of
wandering off aimlessly, he will return to his guard spot.  Also, in battle if
you tell him to Back off, he will return to Guard Spot.

Another thing, if you watch him, while he is guarding you, he will face
whichever direction the nearest perceived 'threat' is to you.

Remember though, if you have him on guard and you move your camp or something,
to tell him to 'Follow'.  Otherwise he will stay in that spot and you will find
yourself on the other side of the zone with no pet!  LOL  (Not that I've done
that you understand...)
