    Outdoors stinks at level 58. Don't want to spend my time looking for
folks to group with in Skyfire, and, well, Skyfire.

    And we laugh back as we take out two blues in the same time and get more
XP net. Besides, at my level yellows usually aren't mobs one fear kites.
They're mobs you just fear. ;-)

    Last night I DA tanked on an overpull. Looks like the detaunt factor on
DA isn't as advertised. And it tried to pound me for a bit, so it wasn't
just latency issues.

    Stun don't stop two mobs at once. Well, Stun Command does but it has a
LONG refill time.

    For higher level mobs, stuns last for a lower duration. Otherwise the
ENCH would be fine on his own, AoE stunning.

    Remedy and Divine Light, plus Heroic Bonds, plus Marzin (or my new toy,
Naltron's Mark) give them a lot of time to channel if being healed.

    Or we have two adds which weren't picked off at a distance, and one mez
resist. Or ONE person that doesn't assist for ONE swing, or ONE pet that
gets hit as mobs come in.

    There's a new NPC in the Warrior's Guild in Kaladim. Talk with him - he
wants you to kill some Enraged Goblins in Butcherblock to get your
Initiate's Symbol of Brell Serilis (Brell-clerics only, AC 3 WIS 1 MANA 3
and right clickable Strengthen IIRC). Give that back to him, and he'll ask
you to go collect some stuff and hand it over to an NPC in Oasis. That gets
you the Disciple's Symbol, AC 5 WIS 3 STA 2 and some MANA, neck piece, which
has as a right clickable effect.....

    Get ready for it.....

    A spell that turns one of your summoned waters into a stack of summoned
booze from Brell. Now you know why I asked. ;-)
