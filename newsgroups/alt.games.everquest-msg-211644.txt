Just because you turned the magical number of level 46 does not mean you are
in any way ready to go plane hoping.  PON is a tough zone for even mid 50s
characters.  My suggestion for a 46 level warrior is to hang around the
Dreadlands or KC(the castel in the middle fo the dreadlands) until you are
52-54ish.  KC is a great place and the exp does not start to suck until
after level 53 or so.
