It will come as no surprise to anyone that I agree with you in what you
said, even the part about him not flaming newcomers in recent months (maybe
due to his being outed as Ron "I have a siege mortar" Green).

So, as such, my opinion carries little weight.

However, the most telling thing must surely be the haste with which he
consigned you to his killfile. He asks you to provide proof, and his reply
to that is the killfile. What more can be done?

I must say,  I swear I heard the sound of a beartrap closing when I read
your post.
