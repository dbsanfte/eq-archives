They most certainly do.  I was duoed with someone, and i was
making a macro to let them know i was snaring the mob, and
wanted to try it to see what they thought, make sure the
macro worked, etc.  Well just before i went to snare myself
while standing by the guards at the butcherblock docks, my
groupmate gave me something, don't even remember now what it
was or why, but because of the trade, she was then targeted,
not me.  Didn't notice/pay attention to that fact and was
shortly a corpse.
