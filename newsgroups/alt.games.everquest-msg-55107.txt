I'll pounce every time I see this. (YAUA) Yet Another Useless Analogy.

Because I think it's rude to inspect someone without asking. Period. If
you don't like that, I suggest you deal with it. You may not think it
rude, but I do. Since all such feelings (what's rude, what's crude, etc..)
are entirely relative, there's really no debate possible here. You can
no more definitively state that inspecting someone is the height of
courtesy than I can state definitively that it's base and reprehensible.

So do yourself a favor, relax, inspect whomever you want, and stop going
off the deep end if someone you inspect tells you to go fuck yourself.
