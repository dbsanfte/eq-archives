1) Many of them are 'unclear' or 'misleading' to say the least. So you 
still spend a few hours trying various combinations of things.

2) And as a newbie baker, finding "Mixxy's Delicacies volume 3" might be 
virtually impossible. There is no way to find it, except to right click 
on every npc in the game until it shows up. NPCs have no conversational 
capabilities at all in this regard. You can't 'ask' about it. Other 
players don't know (either they aren't tradeskillers or they all looked 
at eqtraders for recipies), and if you try to find the npc on the web.. 
really... at that point you might as well just read the book on the web too.

3) The character doesn't need the recipe book. I think the recipe book 
should be an integral part of tradeskilling. Or at least at some point 
the character should have been flagged as seeing it (and it should work 
much like the spellbook.) And then he simply clicks on the recipe to 
attempt to make the item, instead of fumbling through bags in a 
pointless point/click fest. The main point however is to create a 
situation where its your character who knows how to make leather pants, 
not the 'player'.
