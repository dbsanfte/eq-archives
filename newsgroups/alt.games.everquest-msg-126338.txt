I know, I said that there would be inconsistencies because I've never played
high end game.

Yes, but thats true of any game. In Mega Man you kill robots until you get
to the boss, and beat him. Wash rinse repeat. In Jedi Knight 2, you kill
stormtroopers, solve puzzles, fight bosses. Few games undergo drastic
fundamental changes. EQ is the same in the way it plays, but every game is
that way. My point is that it is different if you have a certain paradigm of
it. If you look at it as "Im killing, now Im looting, now I'm selling" then
it's always going to be the same. However, if you "get into" your character,
it can be very different. Thinking of it more like its actually happening "I
hope this charm sticks so that we can take on these giants... yes! It stuck,
Thats right Hil Giant, Do my bidding!" Etc.

I don't prefer the lower levels, I just haven't been able to get to high
levels because of real world demands that keep me from playing. I would LOVE
to make it into the 50's with this new bard of mine. Whenever school comes
around I always stop playing :(
