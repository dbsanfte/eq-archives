Well, a little.  With that many characters I'd expect you to have at
least a few dozen skill-ups from cyans, you sure you didn't miss some
in the battle spam?  ;)  Your point is valid tho, the likelyhood of a
skill-up appears to strongly correlate with the relative level of your

opponent.  I get skill-ups much more frequently fighting white/yellow

cons than on low blues, that's with melees and priest classes.  It is
also, apparently, affected by your level.  I've gotten skill-ups from

green cons occasionally even with characters in their teens, but never

seen that at 20+.  I have also noticed that skill-ups above 180 or so

are pretty rare except when fighting high blues or tougher.
