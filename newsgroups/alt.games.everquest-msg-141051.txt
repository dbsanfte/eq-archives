MT seems to be /random 420 for reasons beyond my understanding.
(When I was on Test it was /random 2000 from the leader, then everyone else
/random whatever he rolled, but that was pre Velious so I don't know what
they do now.)

The basis is from the mists of time, there was a long standing exploit where
you could 'lock' your /random.

/random 100
99
/random 100
99
/random 3
99
/random 123456789
99
I saw a guy doing that once...
