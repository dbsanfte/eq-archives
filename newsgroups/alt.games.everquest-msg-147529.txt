	Why not?

|Didn't you learn anything from a year ago?

	I learned a few terrorists with box cutters can kill a few thousand
people, if they have a year to plan and don't get caught.

	We can annihilate nations in 20 minutes.

	I'm absolutely certain that in another year or two we'll have another
major terrorist attack, or at least a failed attempt at one.  I'm not
seriously concerned about it.  Short of killing everything between Egypt and
Pakistan, inclusive, there's really no way to stop it.

	It would have practically no effect whatsoever.  (Which is why I'm not in
favor of it -- hell, leave them alone for a year or two and they'll probably
go to war with Iran again.  They're overdue.)  Arab terrorist networks (or,
anyone else's terrorist networks for that matter) do not have the manpower,
materiel, money, connections or other resources to subject America to the kind
of intensive terrorist activity we see in, say, Israel.  They have to stretch
themselves to the limit to accomplish anything over here, and blowing up the
latest country to harbor them is not going to improve their situation.  The
problem is won't do much to degrade it, either.

	Eh, nothing wrong that hasn't been wrong for the last 100 years or so.
Wow, big business is corrupt.  Film at 11.

	Its time passed about 100 years ago.  Open a history book.  Modern
corporations can hardly be said to be operating in an "unbridled" fashion.

|Your pride in your country's economic view is admirable but

	Perhaps, but since we could BUY Canada, I'm not worried. :-)

	The one with the bullseye painted on its back?  We'd have been idiots to
agree to those terms.
