I think its a great idea, but IMHO it would be better to make certain loot
race/class lootable...... like decayed armor off crusaders in Cazic. What
the hell is a 51 druid going to do with a Darkforge BP?

This also gives the new race a chance to flourish in their own habitat. How
many of these new kitties are gonna level successfully if all you loot
whores are in there raping the territory?
