It probably went something like:

"OH SHIT!"
"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
"Damn, that's a lot of dragons..."
"Hey you brought a drake too!"
"Yeah, we can handle 4 dragons, but that drake add is too much."
"/bye"

Which is roughly what I saw when we did a whoopsie of Aaryonarr,
Vyemm, Lady Mir, and Fish.
