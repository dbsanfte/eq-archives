Argh!  And here I went ignoring that thread becuase I thought it was a
game of "post the email of the spammer 100 times to catch the address
harvesters"...I missed pictures. :/

I think it's a fine idea.  A famous quotes place is a definite
must....there have been some beautiful ones.  PIctures are great as well,
whether it's people or characters...in a few days I'll FINALLY have my
artwork commission by Evan Smith, so I"ll have a very purty one of her
Foxeye'ness, and maybe I'll be brave enough to give a RL picture as well.  
A section dedicated to narratives is also something we wouldn't be
complete without!  What better place to host Monual's stories, after all?

I'm a passable hand at HTML and PHP myself (more boot-strapping it than
using HTML software), so I make myself available for any grunt work you'd
like done.  And I'm always happy to share my opinion...web pages for
communities is something I love. :)
