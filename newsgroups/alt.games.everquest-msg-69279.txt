45th level, I'm not kidding.

Probably be 52 and have his epic by the weekend, LOL.
I'm sorry but that is just plain sad, sick and mind boggling all at
the same time. How much fun could that have possible been?
Powerleveling for 2 weeks straight. I mean it must have been fun right?
Why else do it, right?

I really have to laugh when people say I play this game too much. Umm no
there are people that play it waaaay more than I ever will. I saw someone in
guild chat say that they were approaching 500 days played on all their
characters combined. Any one hear of a higher level cat or beastlord out
there?

Whatever, to each his own I guess. I guess its like golf and wrestling,
some people must like it since I see it on TV all the time. *shrug*
