You're not stupid. I for some time had a serious EQ addiction, I managed to
drop out of school and loose many friends. (Though most of them are back now
:o)) Once I moved back to my parents, because I couldn't affoard the rent of
my place, my life started to glue itself back together. I still played some
EQ, but not as much as before. It was over EQ that I met my boyfriend, and
moved to live with him. When we moved in together, we still played EQ, but
not as much as we used to, and we both got control over our lives, though we
both want it to involve EQ. I have seen many people, most over the internet,
completley loose themselves in EQ. Not having lives. Just EQ, 24/7... I am
glad I am not one of them anymore. :o)

Solitude, the girl with the chantress :o)
