Perhaps I misunderstand the role of a Warrior or mischaracterize it with my
statement but it seems to me that if your defining ability is to be the best
damage sponge then in order to realize this advantage you also need a
correspondingly superior ability to redirect that damage to your sponge. I
figured this is why one of the changes that they're offering is giving
Warriors the new ability to generate more hate.
