Currently running a 1.2 Ghz Thunderbird Athlon, Geforce 2 mx with 3 sticks
of 256mb PC133 (768MB total) and a Audigy card (it is useful for using
'mcicontrol audio' use but everquest is still in "pong" mode soundwise
though).

The memory helps - with all Luclin character models enabled on W2K it sticks
at around 580MB usage and the HD only stirs when zoning. Having DDR would be
a bonus but quantity really helps here, IE, 768MB of PC133 would proberly
perform better than 512MB DDR with the particular usage quoted above as
relying on swap space would really drag the system down.

The 32mb Geforce2 MX (MX, not 200/400mx) handles graphics fine at 1024 * 768
with no clipping but I haven't tried higher res as I only have a 17inch
monitor. Of course, you still get that EQ trademark shitting oneself when it
is exposed to a scene with new textures in it.  Running through a hallway
where it opens out into large area of new textures causes a 'pause' and
invariably results in  steering overcompensation which seems to run you
around 180 degrees every time. Stopping in a new area and 'mouselooking' all
round to make sure all the textures are loaded fixes this though... as long
as you know to expect it at that location and are not being chased. I half
expect EQ's  "optimized" code to do this on a Geforce 3 though.

I cannot imagine the "elderly" Thunderbird CPU being a problem though - EQ
seems to just come down to how much textures you can crank through your
graphics subsystem and a few times I have accidently left the Seti@home  on
as a background task without noticing it performancewise ingame.

Cheers
