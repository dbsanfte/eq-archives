Yes it does.

You can also do that while swimming.

What's really funny, though is to do it while galloping along
on a horse.  The way the corpse bounces along behind you,
it looks *exactly* like the scenes in any number of old
Western movies where the bad guy drags some poor unfortunate
soul through the sagebrush at the end of a rope tied to his
horse.
