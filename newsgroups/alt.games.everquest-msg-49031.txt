Mostly to point out how much fun can be had by mocking ignorant folks
such as yourself.  The key is that you provide such a foundation for
being mocked in your own words.  So often folks go out of their way to
manufacture an excuse to mock someone (see paul phillips) when posts
such as yours are just asking to be taken advantage of.  In this modern
world every poster has a right, no dangit, a duty to mock those such as
yourself too stupid to even recognize their own ignorance.  As someone
fully aware of my own ignorance I can assure you that this is a service
provided for your own good.  You may thank me now.
