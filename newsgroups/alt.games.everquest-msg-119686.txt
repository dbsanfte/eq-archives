Corpses don't have faction, so, actually, you can get KOSed in certain
parts of Velious (and the planes that came with it) for dragging ANY
corpse. Logic behind it is if there's a corpse in the zone, they're
dead for a reason - generally being, they pissed something off in the
zone either by attacking or being KOS to it. The NPCs seeing you
helping an enemy declare you an enemy as well...
