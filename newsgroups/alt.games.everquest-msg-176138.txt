Ok. This will put the cat amongst the pigeons.

I usually play at an hour when there are not a lot of other players online. The
other night my rogue was the only one in Crushbone and I think there were only a
half dozen in GFay. I was hoping for some recommendations for a char that is an
excellent soloer at all levels, but is also well loved in grouping situations. I
want a soloer, not a loner. I am currently playing on Tribunal.

BTW. does anyone know any guilds that take newbies? I've had a look at a few
websites for the various guilds, including those of the nice folks who have
befriended my other chars, but they all seem to want >50L. I was hoping to find
a group friendly to the casual gamer.

Cheers

John
