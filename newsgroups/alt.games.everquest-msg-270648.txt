Unfortunately, what they don't tell you is that some of your "choices" for
Level 20 are made when you decide if the character's Good or Evil.  If you
pick Evil, then Fighter, then at 10 pick Crusader, then you have already
picked Shadow Knight for Level 20.  Similarly, if you pick Evil, Priest,
Cleric, then you've already picked Inquisitor.

Yes, the Betrayal Quests exist if you want to switch from Good to Evil or
vice versa, but that's not really the same thing as having multiple choices
at your Level 20 choice, is it?  We really need neutral choices which are
along the Crusader, Cleric, Summoner lines, and all such lines where
Good/Evil currently determine your final choice.
