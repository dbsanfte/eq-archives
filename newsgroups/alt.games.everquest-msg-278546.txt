Well, the code could do "the right thing" and allocate 2 exp to one
type of experience and 1 exp to another.  Probably Sony doesn't bother
in this case, because at the level where you have AA experience the
lost 1 per kill is irrelevant.  But in some cases like allocating cost
in accounting you must do this.  For some reason people get even more
upset over lost pennies than they do over lost experience.
