I've been following this post for a while now and wanted to reply to
some of the comments in earlier posts without getting buried in the
ever-expanding thread.

I do not believe that government should regulate morality in any way,
shape, or form.  Government is there to manage other issues like
social order, national defense, economic policy, etc.  Morality is not
something government has ever been good at, nor should it try.

Having said that, I think homosexuality is abhorent to nature and an
abomination.  Now before you fire up the acetylene torch for a flame
fest, consider the following.

There is not a major religion on the planet that condones
homosexuality, making the "Christian" issue against homosexuality a
"religious" one instead.  I can personally vouch for 4 religions
through my own readings of the religious text but the rest are
admiittedly assumed through conversations and indirect readings
(meaning not the religious text itself).  If I am incorrect in this
someone please post the relevant passages and the text it's from and
I'll be happy to correct my (then) mistaken claim.

Another consideration is the act itself.  The primary purpose of
intercourse is reproduction, something that cannot happen with
homosexual activity.

I believe true homosexuals, meaning those who are born with such
impulses and not those who decide to "experiment" later in life,
either have a serious chemical/hormonal imbalance or some
non-intellectual form of mental retardation.  It is not the human norm
to perform such acts and there must be a physiological reason for this
behavior.

I agree that most of the "Christians" that espouse Old Testament
language concerning homosexuals are plainly not living as Christ did.
Christ said to hate the sin, not the sinner.  Which means homosexuals
are not to be hunted or hurt or killed for they're actions, but at the
same time the behaviour is not to be accepted as ok, and certainly not
as an "alternate lifestyle".  Our society is declining in moral
standards and this is in no way the governments responsibility but our
own.  I am not saying that the US should be Christian or Jewish or
Muslim or any other religion, merely that are some moral standards
that are universal and irrespective of religion in general.  Anyone
wanting to equate "moral" with "religious" please look it up first.

Of course this has zero to do with EQ, but it's an interesting thread
anyway.
