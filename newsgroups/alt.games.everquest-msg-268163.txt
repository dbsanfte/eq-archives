I think there is someone there just targeting any and every newsgroup
proposal they can (I believe the source is from Poland, bizarrely
enough)...it isn't personal to me.  But it's still annoying, especially as
all guide sites SAY to wait 7 days after posting your proposal to
alt.config.  That advice is rather dangerous right now. >:/

Against my better judgement I went ahead and submitted a proper control
statement with a charter and a comment saying it was hijacked.  I
hesitated to, because I know a lot of folks still don't want it, but I
wasn't sure if there was harm to myself or the future of an
alt.games.everquest2 (if one is needed later) to leave it as-is.

FWIW, I believe that even at this point I would have to run about
promoting the NG to news servers to get it widely available, so I don't
*think* I've caused any lasting harm if it does end up that it is better
to keep everyone here.
