It's all very well and nice if people come up with these conventions, 
however, like Marc(???) said, they are only conventions. The only rules 
that people *have* to follow are those set out by Cryptic/NCSoft. 
Anything else is voluntary. Note I am not saying that it is right, but 
that is the way that it is.

When you sign in to play CoH, you are accepting those rules, not the 
conventions that other players have decided to play with.

Actually, the machanic that allows you to do this, also allows the drive-
by holding/blinding of the mob, doing no damage but allowing the weaker 
player a chance to finish it off. It allows for assistance to come in if 
the 2nd superhero on the scene is a blaster/scrapper who has no 
buff/debuff/heal/mez powers that can be used. It also allows drive-by 
heals/buffs.

I should point out that the great majority of players do recognize this 
convention. There are only a few fuckwits who don't.

However, based on what I have read about EQ2 (based mainly on posts by 
Bob Perez) is that once the encounter is "locked" no-one outside the 
group can heal/buff/debuff/mez anyone inside the locked encounter. That 
is something that I feel adds a lot to the feel of CoH. The fact that, if 
I am playing a defender or a controller, I can walk/run by an encounter 
and if I see that the other player is having difficulties, I can help 
them and move on. In EQ2, to the best of my knowledge, you can't do that.

I can't count the number of times that I have been in a fight, and some 
anonymous highbie runs by, throws a bubble/heal/buff on the group and 
keeps on going. The fact that this happens more than outweighs, to me at 
least, the problems with asshats who KS.
