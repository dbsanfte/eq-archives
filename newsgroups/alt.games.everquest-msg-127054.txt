I am a recent newbie who went through the process of the OP's friend. 
I am guessing the OP has good intentions and knows the pitfalls. 
Nonetheless, I'd like to share my thoughts with all that may be going
through this.  Knowing what I now know, these would be the things I
wished my more experienced friend had avoided while teaching me the
ropes:

* Remember this is a multiplayer game.  While I definitely wanted to
be grouped up with my RL friend, I wished we had grouped with
strangers more.  My "old" view of a multiplayer game was that it was
group of people who just happened to be playing the same game at the
same time.  EQ gives true meaning to "multiplayer".  I missed out on
how the EQ multiplayer aspect worked until well into my late teens -
yet I didn't know any better!  He could have just as easily PL'd a
whole group of us newbies and that would have worked.

* My RL friend had notions of which zones were the best ones to PL in,
but these zones require more experienced players to be truly
worthwhile.  Newbies are best left to newbie zones, with good reason. 
This was a deathtrap for me, and I nearly gave up playing altogether! 
An example will illustrate the point:  I was lvl 14 cleric, and the RL
friend wanted to sneak through the warrens to fight at the stonebrunt
entrance.  Because it was so dangerous getting through the warrens at
my level, I bound in stonebrunt.  Then the RL friend had to leave for
work.  I was stuck - I was unable to fight stonebrunt mobs solo, and I
certainly could not get back through the warrens!

* I wish the RL friend would have made me aware of the dangers
involved in fighting.  By that, I mean when he PL'd me, I didn't
realize his buffs and twink equipment were making me essentially
invulnerable.  Sure, you want to get past the initial levels fast, but
a couple of deaths may help a newbie realize things do hit hard when
you see the phrase "what would you like your tombstone to say" in red
text.  I'm not saying abandon PL'ing altogether, but "accidentally"
let the newbie die a couple of times.

* It would have been nice if the RL friend had showed me what faction
hits are.  When PL'ing, it is easily possible to overlook the issue
altogether.  Is there some place you can take the newbie to see how
faction can drastically change things?  For example, is there
someplace where the newbie is kos at one point, and after a little
faction work, non kos?  (We're not talking about cabilis faction
here!)

* Don't use ports, firepots, or the nexus to get around initially.  I
was absolutely amazed going from Faydwer to Erudin.  The boat ride to
freeport alone made me realize how huge the world is.  Sneaking
through all the dangerous zones was quite an experience.

* I would say don't PL at all for the the lvl 2 and lvl 3 dings.  I
was quite excited to have killed enough of those pesky GFay wasps to
go up two levels on my own!

* For pete's sake, don't make them find their own way out of a town. 
My first char, which I promptly deleted, was a dark elf.  Imagine a
true newbie trying to find their way through that town!  I got so
frustrated with the maze, I finally decided to go psycho and kill some
merchant.  LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...  Hey!  I'm finally outside the
town!  Woo hoo!

* The RL friend did not teach me anything about skills - My first time
in Faydwer, I got a little too close to the lake in the rear of town. 
I fell in and got soaked.  After figuring out the mouselook and
avoiding a drowning death, I got the message "You have become better
at swimming!  (1)".  I was quite happy, and bragged about it to the RL
friend.  If you are traveling across the continent, jump in and do a
little swimming!  Quite an immersion into the world, and you quickly
learn that you go up in skill level by *using* the skills.

Kudos to all those bringing true newbies to the game.  It is so much
fun to learn the game with RL friends.
