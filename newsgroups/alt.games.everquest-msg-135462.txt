The arguements for and against NBG in general as well as pickup groups
are certainly valid.  When the RBG drops off Vox and the raid is setup
on a NBG basis is it not true that the Druids just MIGHT need the
money from that belt to buy items that DIDNT drop?  

The other week I was on a Vox raid and the 100% WR bag dropped.  The
raid was stated that 1 Book and Scale were claimed, "All other items
will be rolled for on a NBG basis".  Many of the monks felt that the
bag should be a Monk only roll.  They have a point.  By definition NBG
dictates that an item is made available to those who would benefit
from it the most.  WR is most certainly a valid point on Monks.  In
the end, everyone was allowed to roll because "everyone can use WR
bags" and as luck would have it, a monk won it.  While asking about
this on the schedule board for an upcoming raid there I was told "The
bag is All/All so all will be allowed to roll." to which I replied
that the Eyepatch is WIS15 INT15 and ALL/ALL, as a warrior do I get to
roll for it?=)

Now on the other hand just starting to adventure and hunt in KC I was
in a group the other day where the Cobalt Boots dropped.  I lost the
roll to a Cleric.  Fair enough.  Sure I would have liked them but she
can certainly use the money from them.  My only gripe was later when
the JB Boots dropped and they asked if we were rolling or if the
shaman was getting them.  I said we should roll, as was the case when
MY boots dropped.  The Cleric said "I am passing.... or if I roll it
will be to help the shaman get them." - WTF?=)  As it happened, the SK
won the roll and made a really good friend when he handed them to the
Shaman.  So basically on my boots it was everyone for themselves.....
but when the Shaman Boots drop everyone wants to roll and give them to
the Shaman.  <sigh>

BTW - good to see another MT'r here Bergh =)
