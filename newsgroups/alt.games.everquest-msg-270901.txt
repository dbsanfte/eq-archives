For the year I've been playing EQ on Stromm 20p has always been the 
standard "donation" for temp. Although when the need for dots ended I 
was expecting it should drop to 10p. Although I think for the most part 
it didn't. Being a cleric myself it didn't matter to me. Unless I am 
pretty broke I usually buff people for free and refuse donations. 
Although I don't stand around in PoK doing it. Once in a while I like to 
go to CB and buff the lowbies there for free and make thier day. That's 
fun. However, if money's tight I am thankful for whatever amount 
somebody wants to give me.

In any case Jim, add Lyolas to your friends list and send a tell when 
you need a temp and I will take care of you at no cost. The only catch 
is you'll need to come to me for it.
