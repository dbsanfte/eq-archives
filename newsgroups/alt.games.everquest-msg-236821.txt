Bah. Get a Cleric or beastlord (to cure crud) and go to Paludal NOW. Go to
Cat city (Either Shadeweaver Thicket or Hallowshade Moore) and run south to
cave entrance in either zone. Critters are a little lower lever at those
entrances and you will level like you won't believe. You can go from 10 to
18 in a day. Then go through Shadowhaven to the front of Paludal Caverns and
hunt either Bandits or Phlargs there, and get to level 24 in another day or
two.
