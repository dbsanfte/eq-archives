Oh really. *rolls eyes*

No, that's fixing a problem. Appeasement would be when you bow to a
wish that is wrongheaded. There are legitimate beefs with the US
around the world.

I didn't think I needed to be so literal. Live with terrorism from the
arab states and others that you wantonly interfere with.

You don't really think you can squelch them all the way you are going,
do you? You won't even accuse the worst offenders. Some of them are
American friends. Some of them you are *afraid* of, for good reason.

How badly you underestimate them. Almost like you think they aren't as
good as you in some way.

I hear this "America's back against the wall!" crap all the time where
you claim you will do what needs to be done. What makes you think
other people don't think the same way, with a lot less concern for
what their target is?
