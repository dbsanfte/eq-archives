Yes, they do.

This is a somewhat recent change...within the last year and a half, I
believe.  But now you can have separate people casting the same DoT and both
going into effect.  Your DoT may not stack with other spells that *you*
cast, if you already put a higher level DoT on it (some stack, some don't),
but it will always stack with DoT's cast by other people.
