Well, as I recall, SOE has NEVER allowed transfers to Stromm from
other servers; I think the point was to keep people from bringing
in established high level characters, so everyone would be starting
from scratch.  So it would not surprise me if they continue to
disallow transfers to Stromm, even from a merged server.
