It is not hard at all.

Most ATX MBs have 6 screw holes. Most newer cases have a pull-out MB
tray. You just pull out the tray and then mount the MB. The only trick
is making sure the stand-offs for the MB screws (on the tray) match up
to the holes on the Motherboard. You don't want any of the stand-offs
touching the wrong places on the underside of the MB. The MB will have
silver colored washers built into the mounting holes. 3 holes will be
along the edge of the MB where the Keyboard (etc) connectors are
located, and the other 3 will be lined up mid-way back behind them.

Once the MB is mounted, install the CPU, FAN, and RAM. It is much
easier to do this when the tray is sitting out in the open, than when
it is mounted in the case.

The manual for the MB will have a detailed description of where to
hook up the LED and power connectors. It gets confusing sometimes if
the wire leads coming from the case are not clearly marked. Some of
the connectors (like the case speaker) have a '+' and '-' lead that
cannot be mixed up. A good rule of thumb is that the following colors
are "almost" always the '-' lead: white, black, green. If you have a
choice of two leads being green or white (this is usually the case on
the Power Button Lead), the white is the '-'.

Case Leads:
HDD LED (two wires usually red/black, orange/white)
Power LED (two wires usually yellow/black, orange/white)
Reset Switch (usually blue/white grey/white)
Speaker (case) (usually red/black yellow/black built into a 4 lead
connector)
Power Button (usually green/white green/black built into a 3 lead
connector)

If you get one of the smaller case leads mixed up, it is not the end
of the world. Nothing will be damaged. If one of the LEDs, or buttons
fail to work, just recheck the connection and flip it around. Usually
they are mounted backwards.

You main ATA100/66/33 IDE cable will come with the MB. The Blue end of
the connector mounts to the MB. The red stripped wire on the ribbon
cables (for IDE and Floppy drives) goes next to the power connector on
the drive.

Asus ships their MBs with a FANTASTIC! manual. It will guide you step
by step, with plenty of detailed pictures and diagrams. (Iwill, Abit,
and Gigabyte also provide excellent manuals)

heheh I should write a book :-)
