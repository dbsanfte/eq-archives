Ok.  Get the mages you group/guild with, who put out this "number 1 DPS"
like you claim, and get them to parse their damage.

I'd like to see sustained DPS too.. like 20 fights in a row.

I hear a bit about "mages number 1 dps"..  its all hypotherical tho for me,
i've never seen or been offered a SINGLE scrap of proof

Heres my experience with mages.. a long time ago, before I had nice weapons
(primal in main, dunno offhand).. my guild was clearing PoF to do Cazic.

I was puller, and on one pull, trained 3 mages (they had moved away from the
main raid, to kill their own mobs, and were in my pull path).

Me: 60 monk
Them: 60 mage w/epic.  60 mage w/epic.  58 mage no epic

You know something, I got exp on 2 of the 3 mobs.  And yes, they did try to
get exp - banter in /say.. "stop trying to ks me monk!  MY exp!!" etc...  I
still tease them from time to time now about it, when theirs a mage versus
"xx" debate (eg when team mage got exp on Emp one time)

And I know 1 mage on the entire server with the charm spell.
