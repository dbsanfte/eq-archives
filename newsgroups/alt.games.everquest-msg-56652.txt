2       lbs.  lbs is the english language abbreviation for pounds, don't ask me
why.

If he'd meant 21, then he would be saying 21 bs.  Unless you thought that
"bs" meant pounds, you've really just slipped up.  But then you didn't have
any complaint with the monk's apparant weight limit of 151    bs.
