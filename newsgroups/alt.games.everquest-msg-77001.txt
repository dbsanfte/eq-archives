Actually it doesn't make you kos in FV / Thurgadin etc.  It *DOES* reduce
your faction though, which can in-turn make you kos.

If your allied to d0rfs, cast wolf form and you will now see you con aroumd
warmly or kindly.  Of course if your dubious when you con the guards, its
highly likely that casting wolf form will make you become kos.

Im not sure why illusions drop your faction... boon also reduced my SK's
faction in GD recently (faction was too high to make me kos though)
