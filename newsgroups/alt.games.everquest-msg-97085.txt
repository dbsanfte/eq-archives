On Sat, 16 Mar 2002 15:39:40 -0600, "Acral" <nospam@never.net> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Here's some cheese to go with your collective whines.

>Verant offers some VERY aggressive changes that will AID the casual gamer,
>and many people (the same ones who bitched about these types of things being
>problems in the past) are now whining:

The people doing the complaining are the ones who don't get any
benefit from the new changes (or most of them). It's just selfishness.
