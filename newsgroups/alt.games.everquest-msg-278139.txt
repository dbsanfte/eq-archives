Does anyone actually like what they have done with today's 
patch? I for one find the new system quite annoying compared 
to what it was before. It reminds me of the EQ2 vendor 
windows a bit from when I played in beta.

I went to check on new spells, and it shows the name of the 
spell, which is nice, and the price, which I really think 
isn't needed as you need the spell and price info doesn't 
change that fact. What I would have found nice would have 
been the spell level appearing beside the spell. Previously, 
a quick right click and a glance showed the spell level, but 
now that right click opens a window that persists and must 
be then closed by another click. I prefer the old way and 
found it much quicker.

So far, I see no advantages to the change, so wonder why it 
was done.
