 If you are just two boxing or only one other wants to pl go with the
shaman. They have healing spells of a cleric and the augment spells of
the enchanter but not as powerful. As for where to go i'd suggest
rathe mountains or gulf of gunthak on the shoreline. Might want to
have the cleric standing by for temp and rezzing.
