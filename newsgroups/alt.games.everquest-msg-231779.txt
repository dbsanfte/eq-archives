The attitude of top level management tends to have a trickle down
effect at companies.  If top level management are nothing but a
bunch of bean counters that can't see past the revenues of the
current quarter, they'll push "get it done" style mentality onto
mid-level management, which will then get pushed on the developers.

At the end you might have a team of top quality developers releasing
something that is crap, because the bean counters at the top insisted
on releasing it too early.

If top level management has a more balanced attitude (somewhere in
between "get it done" and "get it perfect"), even an average team
of developers can release something decent.

So I would say the poster you responded to is quite possibly valid in
their opinion.  Blizzard has a good track record, and a lot of that
is probably due to good management.  I've personally been consistently
impressed with Blizzard's products, and they weren't all done by the
same development team, I'm sure.
