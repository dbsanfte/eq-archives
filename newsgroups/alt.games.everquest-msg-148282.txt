Indeed, or does he feel so patriotic when he reads that another bomb
funded by some of the American citizens goes off in Ireland or in
London?  Or does he also feel bitter that Verant don't put up a
scorecard of such things on their site?

September the 11th was a bloody awful day and most people around the
world felt how bad it was.    However, it must be said, to avoid
confusion, that a lot of anti-American feeling around the world isn't
directed at the American individuals but at the foreign policy of the
American State.  A massive distinction which a lot of us over this
side of the pond see, this includes my American wife.

Most of the people of the world don't want another 9/11 occuring ever
again for a myriad of reasons but we fear, as does Mandala (a chap for
whom I have little respect anyway) that it could easily happen again
because of the American foreign policy which seems to be have been
kept away from most of the US citiens or censored heavily before
digestion.

America is supposed to be one of the largest democracies today.
However, the problem seems to be that most of the news given to the US
public isn't given in depth enough or presented in enough detail for
people to get to know what the heck is going on.  We have US
journalists writing in the UK papers complaining about this problem
and each time I go over to the US I can spend hours flipping from one
news channel to another without getting any, erm, news.

It is the belief of a lot of people in a lot of countries that a lot
of the tension in the world would vanish if the US people were given
more information and more in-depth news so that they could question
their politicians more.    Then they would realise that a lot of the
anti-American sentiment around the world is not directed at them but
at their leaders.

And before you ask, I did know someone in the.   Someone I used to
drink with most evenings.

Best wishes to all
  Malc
