Forget tradeskills for the moment anyway, to get to a degree of skill 
where the tradeskill will make you money, costs a lot of money and time.

You should grab a few friends and go kill the geonids in Crystal 
Caverns. They can drop gems that sell to a vendor for up to 200p.
Its low risk, high-cash gain, and you will get some nice xp while you 
are at it.
A week on the geos will buy you a fair bit of equipment.
Another choice is to go to Rathe Mountain, again with some friends, and 
kill Hill Giants. They drop up to about 45p each...nice straight cash loot.
