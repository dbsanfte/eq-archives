Have been grouping in a few groups lately having fun but noticed I was
receiving considerably less XP than the others. I duoed with one particular
person 3 times ok he was a different class and 1 level higher, I expect it
to be different. I had gained about 5% xp yet he had gained near on 10%.

Now it could be one of us got the figures wrong, also my Cha was in the red
(bit of a longshot), or was it something I was wearing.  Could be everything
is OK and thats just the ratio at the mid 50s, just got a little concerning
that 3 times we had done this the split was not near the same.

Any thoughts?
