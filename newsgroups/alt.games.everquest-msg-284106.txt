If all you can claim for self esteem is how you play a game, well, that's 
terribly sad.

Yes, I Googled you to see if you were obnoxious everywhere, or just here. 
Some folks wear different hats, depending on what people they're around. 
What I discovered for my time spent is that it seems the folks there don't 
like you any more than the folks here do, and that you seem to thrive on 
creating conflict wherever you post.

You remind me of the Fighter Ace newsgroup folks who came here about 5 years 
ago for the expressed purpose of creating a hostile environment.  The only 
difference is that you're not as intelligent as they were.

My killfile is a small, elite club.  I don't killfile folks wildly, as some 
folks do.  I tend to believe that even an idiot has something relevant to 
say once in a while.  However, through the discourse of three threads you've 
started, you've proven that the signal-to-noise ration of having you around 
isn't worth the possibilty for finding anythig useful.

You may feel free to have the last word.  I know you can't resist.

Crash
