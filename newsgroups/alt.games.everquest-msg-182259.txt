I've been playing since just before Kunark, have one server's
character slots full and another's halfway plus other characters
scattered here and there, I'm a "medium casual" player. Even so, I
have 2 post-50 characters and at least recognize the names of all the
major zones as well as common hunting choices. These are things that
are extremely difficult NOT to find out over the course of such a
period of time if you even half-assedly pay attention.
