Absolute best one, which can be free if you do it all the hard way, is the
8th ring.  9th ring is better, but requires a raid, whereas the 8th can be
done mostly solo (I did the entire quest entirely solo, but wouldn't
recommend doing the final part solo as it's tricky to solo *and* you have to
start all over at ring 1 if you fail).

Amulet of necropotence is another great one, but that one will cost ya.  =)
