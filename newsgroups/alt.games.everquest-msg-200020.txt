I have a lvl 5 Warrior (Istarl) on Stromm and i can't get any
experience for him, therefore im bored with EQ. What a waste of 150$
ish dollars, the frustrating thing is If i could actually survive
while exploring i might actually have fun but i don't a buddy who I
convinced to get the game is having the same problem, this sucks. When
i play EQ i usually only play for 2hr stints, I don't know what im
doing wrong and from what i've read here ppl don't group till lvl 10!
WTH thats 5 lvls between my char & what i need to group (according to
info i've found on this board.) Why can't this game be more newbie
friendly? i don't have any lofty goals while playing EQ i just would
like to see everything but when i go exploring i usually get through
at most 3 areas before some big monster comes and bashes me and i
promptly die. Im having no success bringing in other friends into EQ
(and thus allowing myself to form a group of real life friends below
lvl 10 in EQ (another friend installed eq and said "the control scheme
sucks, im to lazy to remap, goodbye" another friend tried playing and
after dying 20 times in a row without getting a single kill said "i
hate dying im not playing anymore" the friend who has kindof stuck
with EQ is on the verge of quitting now too, what amazes me is that 4
(including me) different ppl i know tried this game and have already
either abandoned it or are about to. Im beggining to wonder how anyone
managed to make it through the initial stages of this game. me and my
friends are all experienced gamers (i own a n64 (13 games) , PS2 (3
games), gamecube (14games), PC (100+ games) and my friends are pretty
much in the same boat) Im really amazed that this is the biggest
MMORPG in existence right now.  Im beggining to suspect im going to
need to invest hrs upon hrs of time into reading though all the
various EQ websites, which due to time constraints will mean that all
the time i am able to allocate to EQ will be spent (for the next
couple of weeks) reading all the bloody websites devoted to the game,
this isn't something i am willing to do, at this stage im thinking of
getting a modem for my cube in order to play Phantasy Star Online
(PSO), online and cancel my subscription to EQ, a game needs to be
more newbie friendly than this one. In terms of # of locations EQ
beats PSO but since i cant see most of those areas its really
pointless. The game was okay for the first 5 lvls, it took me about 5
hrs to get to 5th lvl, and i could see progress (im gaining levels)
but this has come to a standstill at lvl 5 and i've played for roughly
5 hrs at lvl 5 and 6th level isn't even on the horison my XP hasn't
budged and its frustrating, im stuck in a very boring, limiting part
of EQ when i use the plane of knowledge (or something) to travel to
far off vistas i promptly die, i don't have enought cash to buy new
weapons & armor (though i nolonger have the starting armor as i found
someone that offered to take a (pelt? or something) and made me a new
shirt but other than that i have initial 1st level starting equipment
and don't have nearly enough cash to buy a new weapon or armor.
accordin to the manual (the one that comes with the EQ tril) there
supposedly are quests you can go on and NPC's will give them to u
(according to the manual, you hail the NPC and they will say i have "i
need help with my [problem] and then you ask a question about the
problem and you get a quest or something aside from merchants and the
person you give the note (that you start the game off, the one that
trains you in skills) to every NPC ignores me (and no im not far away
either) so i've given up on hailing NPC's as its pointless. So now
basically all i do in EQ is kill monsters that don't budge my XP bar
or get killed by monsters that are far stronger than i am (thus
returning me to my starting city (after i don't even bother returning
to whereever i died), what a fun game!!!
