I'm going to assume you were just tired or something and not thinking
straight when you wrote the following:

"I don't care whether you <think> you're being offensive, if you act
rudely or offensively you <are> being offensive.  I don't care if you
<think> you are being discourteous, if you're discourteous you are
discourteous.  [And if some people find me rude and offensive here
in the NG, well, I guess I can live with that.]

If you join my group and are more interested in being unintelligible
than in working together to accomplish whatever our common goals are,
then you're being an ass no matter how "creative" you think your
schtick is.  And if you're enough fun to be with you can roleplay a
mute with Tourette's syndrome and it won't stop me from looking you
up to group with in the future."

I don't see you saying here that *you* think I'm being offensive or
discourteous, just that it's offensive and/or discourteous, period.  You
said...

"If you join my group and are more interested in being unintelligible
than in working together to accomplish whatever our common goals are,
then you're being an ass no matter how "creative" you think your
schtick is"

Now if you'd said you would ask me to leave if you think I'm being
unintelligible then I might understand that... and I would leave and find a
group that doesn't mind my RPing.  But saying that if *you* can't understand
me then *I* am being an ass is definitely "elitist".

Nevertheless I think you may not have intended to say it in quite that
way... so I'll let it go at that and simply agree to disagree.
