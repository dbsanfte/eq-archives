Ok now that you are at the point where Jewel craft is very slow and costly I
suggest working with Star Rubies and Fire emeralds. Also Enchant your metals
now even when practiceing. With enchanted jewelrey you can make a little
profit (up to 10p) per peice selling to vendors with good cha. After
Sapphire skip rubies and go to low level Plat jewelrey. Good spot for
information is www.eqtraders.com
