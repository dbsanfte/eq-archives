This is how loot works everwhere, with few exceptions.  If you
can get it at level X, then you can get ten of them, sell them
all, and buy an item that drops at level Y.  Meanwhile, the level
Y people are selling their drop items and buying level Z drops
instead.  At the top end of the scale, its not the level that
limits you, but how far advanced you are into the whole POP
structure et al; people who aren't POTime level yet are still
caught in the same rat race, getting BOT drops and selling them
to earn enough to buy Elemental drops.

The only other mechanism for upgrading yourself is via No Drop
gear.  No Drop gear has to be substantially better than
droppables at the same level of accessability, because its
competing with that stuff you can buy (level Y for the level X
people, etc). Augments are in this category, allowing you to
improve that level Y stuff with no drop items available at level
X.  For the most part, this mechanism doesn't fare well, as it
doesn't take into account mudflation, a no drop item thats
similar to a X plus 5 item when introduced (and at that point,
perhaps Y is X plus 5) becomes pretty crappy when mudflation
means that Y is about X plus 10.  There are a few items like the
druid armor that drops in Umbral Plains that are still worth the
effort, but other than that, the augment idea seems like the best
one for this; since you can put a level X augment on a level X
plus 5 or X plus 10 just as easily, the moving target that is Y
can still be improved on by means of the augments.

 Raids work out much the same, really, as droppables; you spend
the effort needed to get 10 items at your level, and get one,
because the other nine went to nine other people in your
raid/guild... and the stuff you -want- is almost certainly still
no drop.
