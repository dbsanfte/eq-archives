Ok any advice for a level 30 Enchanter with this set-up :
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=659992

I'm looking to get a few more focus 2 items and to increase my normal 
Cha witout loosing much in the way of INT.

I know that the Back slot must go, and I'm looking at Dull Metalic as an 
upgrade, but the cloak has no AC (most odd I think that they just forgot it)

My gloves are also about as bad as posible, but I'm having trouble 
finding a sutible upgrade that is not either a bit naff or xxxkpp. Any 
ideas.

The Jaded Bracer must go too. I'm not even sure why I still have that. 
Hell another blood weave would be better. :-P

I'm on FV so No Drop items are more available.
I don't have huge amouts to spend, but I am making cash on reserch 
spells and jewelery (Who says Trade skills don't pay?)
At the moment I'm not looking to spend much over 1k for any item (I will 
stretch to 2k if it is a real bargin)

So do your worst, but remember that this is FV, I have limited funds and 
I'm still only level 30.

Cheers.

Jim
