Most whines would be a one time event.  Misery loves company. The
group of "Whiner killers" add to the problem more than the whiners do.
It's a septic system.  One person drops a pile and this newsgroup has
plenty of people ready to add to the pile.

Some people love misery and stick around to argue with the septic
system.

Because this newsgroup has a crowd for them to argue with.

They can't move on.  It becomes a dick waving party and there are
plenty of dick wavers in this newsgroup.

You see the whiners who whine about the whiners, the whiners, and the
dick wavers are the problem.
