That's the description of a casual/family guild learning/trying to raid.

The guild I'm in, target is called, 90% of people are at the target area
within 10 minutes, buffing is complete and groups are formed within 5
minutes of that.

We start clearing immediately and don't stop until the target is dead.  We
know the target is up because it's been checked in advance.  Obviously, in
some locations such as Ikkinz, the target is always up since it's
instanced.

Latecomers make their own way to the raid, get to the target area or close
enough and arrange a corpse drag if required.
