Frankly as a warrior I'd SELL the rygor AND the crafted 
for a Crustacean shell bp. It has 15 sta and 19 ac making it a GREAT
warrior chestpiece (and I think 5 str) Really though you don't have
the ac of say the enamelled black bp at 25, the crusteacen can nearly
carry you until you are getting some type of planes bp or could afford
the 9 k or less people charge for the excellent barbed ringmail bp (30
ac and 50 hp.. really the equivilent of the stonewood mail you can
only get if you win the roll on a plane of growth raid at 46 plus..
nuts)

At 36 still my tank is in all crustacean and still finds it to be
great as long as she also maximizes accessory AC/HP slots such as
rings/neck/ears.
