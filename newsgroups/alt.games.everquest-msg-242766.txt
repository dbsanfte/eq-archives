Wizard: Primary role - burst damage...also some minor utiltiy. The Wizard's
job is to end fights quickly, and he is the best at it. He is not the best
by a significant margin until the mid 40's, and the other burst-damage
classes (nukers) do a good job of catching up over the next 20 levels, but
at 65 the Wizard is king. The road is very, very long. The Wizard, grouped,
will expell is his mana by snaring and stunning the enemies, and dispensing
damage toward the second half of the fight. The Wizard does well to avoid an
enemy's attention, and is wise to cast his damage in a way that will end a
fight, rather than play his aces in the first hand. The efficient Wizard
will be pay attention to the behaviors of his different spells in relation
to his targets: some mobs resist fire, some resist cold, some resist magic
in general. The Wizard, solo, is able to take on mobs rather efficiently in
groups, though this skill takes patience to master. Ah, and the wizard can
teleport, but walking is all the rage and clicking on books is too
fashionable to ignore (though for dungeon crawls, a wizard with a fast evac
can save hours of fashionable walking, sneaking, hiding, running, et
cetera...).

Warrior: Primary role - getting beat up ...that's it. The Warrior is
inherently best at taking blows. While he has little means to hold the
attention of an enemy while his group attacks it, those who cause the
Warrior to be ignored by the enemy will regret it. Tanking is based on two
things: absorbing an enemy's damage and being the only one to receive that
damage. Paladins and Shadowknights are better, overall, at holding an
enemy's attention, but the Warrior has the best overall makeup for absorbing
damage. The Warrior, while simple in premise, requires a good amount of
attention to be paid, both in the short term (picking targets, gaining
aggro, switching weapons, pulling), and over time, as his equipment will
need to be upgraded and replaced. For this, planning is essential: certain
zones are more profitable than others, some quests are tedious but worth
doing, and being patient is equally crucial for building one's character up
(though this is true for all things). The Warrior's most important statistic
is always his Hit Points - and don't let anyone say different - but worrying
over a number is silly. The rich Warrior will solo up to the 50's, but most
become reliant on groups much earlier, sometimes as early as 20. Besides,
the best Warriors, regardless of equipment, wouldn't be the best without
solid players to group with. Building a reputation as a conscientious
Warrior is the ticket to getting and keeping good groups.

i kind of just want to say "hey, are you new? don't be a warrior, because
you'll die a lot and hate it! dont be a tank unless you play a caster to a
high enough level to twink yourself out a little" hehehehehe

IMO the FAQ should read, on the first page:

DONT PANIC

DONT BE A TANK, EITHER, IF YOU'RE NEW!

(but then, in really small letters....)

fine, be a druid, but QUIT that and reroll as soon as you understand the
world doesn't need you!


hehehehheheh ^_^
