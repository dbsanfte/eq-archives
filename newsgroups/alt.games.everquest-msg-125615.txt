You're close in your description of FV server rules, but ...
The alignment restrictions and their associated exp bonuses/penalties
have been scrapped.
There are easy workarounds available when the language restrictions
interfere with play.
And finally, you left out the single most important distinction FV has:
one character per account.  This single restriction has a greater impact
on the server's "culture" than all the rest combined.
