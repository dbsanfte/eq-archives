Everquest:How to farm 10k plat in 1 hour?Although I'm sure it doesn't need
to be said, I feel obliged to add:

Don't waste your money on this scam.  There is no information in this guide
you couldn't get by simply asking the newsgroup.

I am reminded of the old old Steve Martin stand-up routine.

How to make a million dollars, tax-free!

First, make a million dollars.

Then, when April 15th comes around... don't pay your taxes!

If the IRS comes around and asks why you didn't file an income tax return,
simply slap your forehead and say, "Oh... I forgot!"
