I don't find the effect of Boon of Garou to be slight but I do agree the
stat bonuses from armour and jewelery make no noticeable difference.

I used to believe (probably because I read it here or something) that weapon
procs were dictated by delay, the slower the weapon the higher the chance it
would proc. It seemed to make sense as my then (and still) two hander,
Felhammer, with a delay of 46 could go on rediculous proc'ing sprees but
something like my blood point(s) would proc far less even tho they had a lot
more chance to do so with a delay 21.
Since then I have owned some other twohanders, all of which I have been
disappointed with in comparison but figured it was the lesser delay. Then I
tried a Black Acrylia Halberd, delay 48. I hardly proc'd it at all and only
with garou (and so 208 dex) did I manage to proc it more than once a fight,
so I'd tend to agree with you, different weapons appear to have different
proc rates.
