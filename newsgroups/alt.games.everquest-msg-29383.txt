I know, thats why the gloves suck. Stupid me just had a old print of the
recipes without stats on the armor, so didnt knew the gloves sucked before i
made them. Still wonder why the guy wanted to buy them.

Yep, better wis, just havent seen anyone for sale yey, but am heading to
Velious soon myself, so will probably pick up some when im there.

The Imbued enchanted version require a Blue Diamond, so would probably be even
more expensive than GEBs.

Hehe, yep. With that Anklet not even the boots are sellable. Wonder why only
the tailored cultural armor suck. The cultural armor arent great, but at least
better than the tailored stuff. VI should maybe consider making at least some
of the stuff better than velious loot. With Lucin im sure there will be new
even better stuff, that would make even the smithed culturals useless too.

Yep, would be a waste of good materials to make the studded armor. Its kinda
wierd that the studs for the studded armor are more hard/expensive to make
than the bonings for the reinforced armor. I wont even consider making the
studded velious stuff if i can aviod it, a LOT more expensive to make the
studs with 35pp for each temper.

Hehe, if im REALLY bored i go to Kith for a few hours, kill Dread Wolves (at
34 its about the only thing in there that i get XP from that dont kill me. The
400 hp harm touch from the skellies that con green to me are bad enough, dont
wanna know what a blue conning skelly with a pet can do), and forage, can get
around 2-5 oak bark a hour.
Also met a guy who got me a lot, had some sort of program running that told
him where in BB it spawned. of course didnt mind that he got me 15 Oak bark,
but wouldnt like to use a program like that myself, like to keep my account,
and dont have a secondary computer to run it on anyway.

I made around 10 boots or so now, i try to put my price as cheap as possible,
so i can sell the damn stuff, had a lucky streak making 4 boots in 8 tries, so
at the moment i can sell them at 400pp, then i can afford making them, but
dont earn much on it (think i earn around 10%), but at least i can get a
little more skill on it, before moving on to the expensive Velious tailoring.
