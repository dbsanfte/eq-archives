Bizbee wasn't being funny, he was being a sarcastic asshole
and issuing another personal jab.

There's a big difference.

This is at least the sixth time he has childishly implied that
I have some sort of obsessive rule about not giving "new posters"
a hard time, when I've made it entirely clear that I don't -- that's
only Bizbee's brain-dead interpretation of my actual complaint
with him.  I'd be glad to post it for you again if *you're*
unclear on that point as well.

If you think his continued stalking of me, popping up to incessantly
whine about a position I do not actually hold with regards to new
posters is "humor" (especially after he has cowardly hidden behind
his killfile), then I'm sure you'd get some big laughs
down at the local mental hospital, the residents there are just
as "humorous", and in much the same way.

Bizbee's not trying to amuse us, instead he's exercising the enormous
grudge he has against me for providing documentation that he
actually does give undeserving people mounds of shit, after he
had challenged me to provide it.  I did, and now he's royally
pissed.

He's not expressing his jolly good humor, he's bitterly sniping.

If you think that's an example of "humor", well...
