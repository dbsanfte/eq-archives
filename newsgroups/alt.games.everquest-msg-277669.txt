It's not clear that this will "clean up" the non-buy-for-cash servers,
but I hate to the think of what the cash servers will look like.  Who
is going to want to be there, except the people who have paid out $$$
for stuff?

What was interesting in the announcement was that in true corporate
speak, they gave their reasons in reverse order.  Let's see: "the
players are ok with it (yeah right), it will make it easier on
customer service (maybe, maybe not), and, oh yeah, by the way, we
happen to see a huge market here".
