I keep that one loaded there too.  I find bolts have a pretty severe
drawback there, along with the obvious advantages.  They have a "connect
time" and if the zone is even slightly busy you will be yelled at for KS'ing
(by people who refuse to kill the lizards/basilisks, of course).

If I'm real lazy, watching TV or something, and want to get some easy money,
I pop out a horse and stand dead center of the hill and bolt anything that I
can target, pet kills it within looting range cause I just take the hits and
don't tell it to attack.  Haven't done that since DX9, so not sure I
actually *can* target stuff like that anymore.  I generally used burnt wood
staff for that, though.  True laziness, good for 500-750 an hour I'd guess. 
Needless to say, I was too lazy to actually time it on those occasions.  =)
