I've decided to buy some Tboots (I'm not looking for pros/cons of
buying these!)

I know I need to get to the Gnome vendor in Sol A, and I know I need
good faction to get them (not to mention 5.5-6k cash!).

So has anyone bought these and how did you get them?

I'm a 38 Mage, but I think soloing this little venture may be suicide
- even with invis.  I've got no idea as to the layout either, so will
need a guide.

This is my plan so far.  Here's what I need (minumum I think):
- 1 friendly tank (for beating up gobbos)
- 1 friendly porter (wizzy or drood)
- Me!

Here's the plan:

1. Three of us enter Sol A and find way to gnome merchant in castle.
2. Porter and I bind ourselves at merchant location.
3. All 3 of us tp out, so I can go to bank and get cash. Need to do
this as carrying the money is far too heavy.
4. Porter and I gate back to vendor and buy boots.
6. Porter port us out to avoid fighting our way back to surface.

Does this seem to convaluted? Do you think a 38 Mage could get there
on his own?

Thanks.
