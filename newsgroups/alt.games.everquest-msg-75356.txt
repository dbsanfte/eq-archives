That's cool.  Backstory is always a bonus... I don't think Verant has been
all that successful at telling their story.

I could give that a try, put together a group in LoIO...

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
