I'm sure others will point this out, but what you meant then is Know your
role.  Very big difference.  Know your roll would probably have a lot more
to do with what your rolled on a random 100.  Not slamming your English
skills, just making sure you understand the difference between the two
homonyms.

I'm not going to get into a discussion on what the looting rules should be,
my personal feeling is that the group should agree on the rules, whatever
they may be.  Need before greed is one acceptable rule, but remember that
most people have more than one character, and also that some of these items
can be worth a significant amount of plat which many people need in order to
upgrade their equipment, so it is not necessarily the only acceptable rule
for looting.  All I am saying is that the group needs to agree on what the
looting rules are.

As far as knowing your role, I agree that you need to learn what your role
is in a group, what that role is and/or should be will probably be the
subject of a heated debate, it certainly has been in the past.

I'm sure that there will be a debate on exactly what items are appropriate
for what class too.
