OMG this is one nasty pet pieve for me...  the street in front of my
house is a road that all the high school kids take as a short cut.
speed limit is 20 mph, and these buggers are hauling ass....  can hear
their engine way before they get to my house and way after...

I have a bucket of bolts sitting out front next to my garage door.
Lets just say, numerous times the cars stop rather quickly wondering
what the hell is that loud KRAK... or THUNK....

Ill paint their little red wagon
