Pass the test.. sweep the rewards.  Whats a crock of shit about that?
Should they just let ANYBODY in there?

The zones are so sweet because they are empty.  PoV was no different.   This

learning new strats.

Guess what,  ST dropped 15/20 monk weapons like candy, 13/20weapons for

That was restricted to certain people too.. just like everything else in the

If you want the sweet rewards, you have to get out there and earn them.
