I'm probably not a good person to ask. I've been playing EQ since it
was released, so of course I could operate the EQ interface in my
sleep (and I have, on occasion).

DAoC is new, and different, and so automatically doesn't seem as easy
to me. You'd probably get a better answer from someone who just
started both games.
