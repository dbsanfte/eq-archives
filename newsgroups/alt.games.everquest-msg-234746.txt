Hmm, I guess I'm gonna have to blow 6 AAs on it so I can do some
testing <g>.

Good idea about shrew, guess I'd finally have a reason to break down
and buy that spell <g>. It probably wouldn't work that well for
pulling hard, even with virtue and focus, my pet won't break 4500hp
which is nothing when mobs are hitting for over 900. 

LDoN hard is about the only place I can see using i. Unless there's a
bard around that I know, trying to get someone to pull hard just isn't
gonna happen. Our groups aren't uber enough to handle multiple 900
hitters in camp at the same time and nobody but a bard seems to be
able to pull singles.  On normals, it's not really a problem since
nobody worries about pulling singles. Any pull less than 4 usually
isn't worth waking the cleric <g>.
