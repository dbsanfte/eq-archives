We can only dream of that.

Two more years of one of the top 5 most idiotic presidents ever to "lead" the
country.  6 more if he figures out how to steal the election again, and he's had
quite some time already to stack the deck.

I keep thinking he's going to pull off his "scooby doo villain mask (tm)" and
reveal that he's really Dan Quayle after all... but then he says something
stoopider than Danny ever managed to misutter.

Why I'd rather have the people at Verant/Sony in charge!
