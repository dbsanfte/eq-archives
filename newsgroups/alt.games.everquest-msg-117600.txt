I dunno about that.  On Xegony at least, Wenglawks isn't spawning.  I
was waiting on him to spawn so I could get another pair of Engraved
Bone Paldruns to replace the pair I gave to a buddy.  After two days,
I finally decided to petition a GM who told me that Wenglawks is
busted and there isn't any ETA on when he's gonna be fixed.  Damnit.
