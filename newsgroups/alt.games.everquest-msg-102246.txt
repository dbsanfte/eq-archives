Oh, definitely been there, done that. That was actually part of the
reason I started playing myself. Not fun when the boyf prefers playing
with gnolls instead of with you...

Environmental chemistry and mucked around with computers instead of
chemicals while getting my degree. So now, I am overeducated for small
jobs, and can find maybe half a dozen jobs a year worth even applying
for. I am really mad I didn't get the one I was just turned down for,
as it was completely, utterly perfect for me and they apparently found
someone with work experience or something instead :/
(And no, I don't want to be a teacher although it seems I'll probably
have to do that in the end)

I have savings. I could afford to move out, buy a new computer, get a
dsl line and pay for food and rent for a year or so. So, once I get an
income to pay for food and rent, I can move out and buy both those two
things *and* furniture and stuff.

!!!
When I started mucking around with taking computer classes, I spent a
lot of time on telnet chats. I've known people who had to sell their
computers to pay bills (efficient way to quit, that...)

Heh. Email it to me? (tiscali.no instead, even though shavenwookie is
an actual address)
I can understand Julenissen getting through, but Steroid is an
international word.

Between Stavanger and Bergen?
Maybe one day I'll start an alt (probably a druid of some sort) on AB
and go looking for Weejuns. I've met a couple Swedes on EMarr,
including an uberguild gnome warrior :)

I am not in any of the local 'computer geek societies' and got hooked
on the game in the US, so it kinda makes sense I don't know anyone.
I'd have to stalk the store and see who bought it to find out who
plays around here :) (100k in what I call my local area)

>Rune, my condolences on the passing of your canine companion.

Thanks. We had leg of lamb for dinner today. She would have loved the
bone.
