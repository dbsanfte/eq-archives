Socialism is an economic system, like capitalism and communism.  I don't 
think there's a capitalist or communist country on the face of the earth 
currently, everyone is at least partially socialist.  Which isn't 
necessarily a bad thing, but due to Nazi germany (which was evil due to 
its politics, not its economics) the idea gets a bad rap.

We don't, however, live in a pure democracy either, we live in a 
representative democracy, which means we are ruled by elected officials 
who are free to vote however they want, with only the vague threat that 
we might disagree and kick them out a few years after their vote.  A 
real democracy would be possible now with the internet; allowing 
citizens to vote on issues wholesale instead of just on representatives 
and the occaisional ballot initiative.  But I'm not entirely sure I'd 
actually like that, mobs can be fickle and are rarely sane.

Trouble with this theory is that there were perhaps 10,000 terrorists 
before the Iraq invasion, and now there are 100,000 and more pouring in, 
plus the contributions to terrorist support "charities" went way up.

Yes, at the moment many of these people are tied up in screwing up our 
chances at making Iraq a showplace for freedom... but in the long run, 
those people and organizations aren't likely to be blind to the idea 
that striking at our civilian population in our country would be a good 
way to further increase their support and to weaken our will to fight. 
Even if the latter isn't true, this doesn't mean that terrorists 
understand that fact.

Carter wasn't a self made man?  Or Reagan?

Sure, by the time they were elected they were rich and powerful; I don't 
think its possible for a nobody to spring to the top of the world stage 
these days; if you can't turn your charisma and wits into a small 
fortune, do you even deserve consideration as leader of what is 
theoretically a capitalist society?

On my daily summary sheets for my employees, one of the items is a Wish 
List; the Buy list is things they need to be able to do their job the 
next day, the Do list is things they need me to do to enable them to do 
their job the next day, but the Wish list is things they would like to 
see but haven't had in the past and might never get.

If there's no pressing or brilliant idea for the business to put here, 
most of them instead include wishes for outlandish items like the Taj Mahal.

Last Sunday, though, one asked for someone to vote for who would make a 
great president.

I said that was impossible in today's climate, nobody who would be great 
would ever make it thru the filters.

She agreed to accept good as sufficient.

I told her to write in Jimmy Carter.  While he may not have been the 
greatest president we have ever had, he wasn't bad either, and he's been 
the greatest ex president in the countries existance.  He's far more 
experienced now, far more credible now, and is up against a far crappier 
field than he had to run against back in the 70s.  He's only served one 
term, so nothing stands to stop him from running for a second but his age.

However, he seems to be in good physical and mental health, and we've 
elected older men to office in the past.

Sadly, he's not on a ticket, and voting for him would almost certainly 
be throwing your vote away; there's a chance, however slim, that voting 
for Kerry would actually get Bush Lite out of office; not that Kerry 
would be any great shakes, but honestly, compared to the loser in office 
at the moment, anything has to be an improvement.

I'm also hoping that Kerry is getting the Dole treatment from his 
election advisors, and that he's actually a far better person than he 
seems in the advertisements and most interviews; About a day after 
losing the election to Bill, Dole shed his straightjacket and showed 
such a personality and sense of humor and proportion that I almost 
wished I'd voted for him.  Did you see Kerry on the Daily Show?  I 
really thought I saw a glimmer of someone who wouldn't be a complete 
jerk, although he did occaisionally stick to the message instead of 
answering the questions, like a good politican android, Dole II.
