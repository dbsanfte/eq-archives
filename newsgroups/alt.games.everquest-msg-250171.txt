   I am.  Because I remember how crowded the Lake of Ill Omens used to be. 
For non-Iksar, this place was something of a pain to get to.  But it was
regularly crowded, with 100+ being common, most of the time.  They changed
the experience modifier on it, and then *poof* the zone is quite save for
the sounds of the sarnaks singing songs of joy.

   Not an unreasonable thought.  But incorrect, given the behavior shown in
the past.

     No arguments on that one.  I'm firmly in the "Let's hold of on all new
expansions until we get the stuff we got in good working order" camp.
