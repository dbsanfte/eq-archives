Every site I went to yesterday had a little something, a banner,a
ribbon, something.

One lived across the street the other down the block. I joined EQ
because they were having a good time playing. And yes other firemen 
played as well. And I'm sure someone in the towers must have played,
but that's only an assumption.

Not insulting any here, some of you have said you play to forget,thats
fine. I only made the point Verant could have had a little something.

This is just me blowing up, it had been a rough day for me and maybe I
was just disappointed. But it is just me.

In my heart of heart I hoped that maybe they would post something
later that day. I did in fact call them and ask them why they had
nothing on their web site about 9/11. I was told by the customer
service agent that she wasn't aware there was nothing posted. 
Even she said there should be. I didn't really give it to her over the
phone, she was in fact surprised that there was nothing posted.
And the Un-American Fucks are once again Verant. Not players.

So you see I never insulted anyone but Verant in my post, nowhere do I
call players of EQ Un-American. No where do I say you must do this.
All I said was why couldn't Verant have shown support and unity like
others.

All I made was a rant like others who rant here. But we are all
sensitive to events and I saw how you reacted. Out of anger.
And I guess it was easy to aim it at me, the poster.
