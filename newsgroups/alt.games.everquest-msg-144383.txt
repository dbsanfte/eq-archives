You are quite welcome.

I did quote the relevant part of my original post, in which I explained
ranger gate.

I'll repeat the explaination: "Port to bind."

Get it?

Oh, if it helps, I can "cleric COTH" em back after they "ranger gate."

Getting any clearer yet?

I find it very hard to believe that if you asked your guild, or
ooc in any populated zone, what a "ranger gate" is, that noone
there would be able to tell you.
