Since you mention the EW/IC zone.  Last night my 32 Druid escaped a
bad situation in EW (one Snow Cougar too many) by zoning to IC, and
was promptly exterminated by 5 Kromrif Tracking Wolves that hit for
up to 185 with Bash/Kick damage of 60+.
[pause for all to *woot* because a Druid was killed]
I then returned to get smushed again, naked this time, as it didn't
occur to me that they would still be there 5 minutes later so I didn't
refresh Invis after Succorring across EW (FV server, can only bind
where melees do, so I stay bound in PoK).
[pause for a rousing chorus of "Ding Dong the Druid's Dead"]
It turns out that these wretched ?hi-40s? curs were stuck there on
the bridge due to a pathing bug, for all I know they're still there.
Fortunately they don't see through Sup. Camo., if it weren't for PoP
ports I bet I'd have seen a lot more corpses there (most folks get to
EW thru GD now, at least that's how it looks to me).
Anyhow, I'd sure love to see the Bard who trained them there taken
down a few pegs (preferably all the way to zero = banned permanently).
No, I didn't see it done, but I've got a strong suspicion that's the
same as my suspicion as to where the Snow Griffin came from that
jumped and killed me the night before when I was well off any mob path.

that the general population has of Halfling Druids.
