  You can get a GeForce3 Ti200 for around $160 from several online stores.  Use
pricewatch.com... I recommend against going with the absolute cheapest price you
see quoted, but try to find an appealing price, check out the place's web site
and verify that it is indeed a GeForce3 Ti200 they're selling for the listed
price, then check and see what the place's reputation is using
resellerratings.com.

  A GeForce2 MX400 is adequate from what I've been hearing from many EQ players,
though it isn't ideal.

  You have a few options in between the GeForce2 MX400 and the GeForce3 Ti200
(roughly in order of least powerful to most powerful): GeForce2 MX400, GeForce2
GTS, GeForce2 Pro, GeForce2 Ti200, GeForce2 Ultra, GeForce4 MX420, GeForce4
MX440, GeForce3 Ti200.

  Note that some of these cards are pretty old or pretty new, so availability
might not be so good on some of them.  Note that I place the GeForce4's behind
the GF3 in performance... that's because they are actually higher clocked
GeForce2 MX's with a few nice bells and whistles added on, and they actually
don't match up to the GeForce3 in most of the benchmarks I've seen.

  I personally recommend going with the GeForce3 Ti200.  You get full DirectX8
compliance and very good performance at a pretty reasonable price.
