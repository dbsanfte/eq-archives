Hehe, no problem :). Unfortunately we don't yet have the choice that
you do. The UK has even lagged behind the rest of Europe for broadband
because British Telecom, who used to be a nationalised monopoly, have
been dragging their heels to stop progress since the UK
telecommunications market was opened up to competition. Things are
changing, but slowly. I simply cannot get a DSL line not a Cable Modem
where I live, and I live in a large city, a regional capital, yet my
only option is still dial up.
