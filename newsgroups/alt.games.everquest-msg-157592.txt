What is the level requirement for this Plane? I have a level 16 Cleric
and it gets ported to a different location within the same zone, A Guide
or GM, cannot remember which, told me as a result of my petition, that
it was limited to 46 and above, but later a guildie was there with his
SK, which is level 36.
