Most things were worse. At the beginning this game was riddled with
bugs and broken quests. It is WAAAAAAY better now. Especially
with all the interface changes and improvements. EQ is 10 times
better now then when it came out. Trust me you are much better off now.

So what? Who cares? The question is have YOU done everything? Do you
care that someone else has seen a movie or read a book before you?
What difference does it make? Don't read spoiler sites so much and just go
explore and play.

So what? There are infinite mobs and loot out there. Have YOU killed
everything in the game? Have YOU gotten all the items? I have been
playing for over 2 years and have not been everywhere and seen
everything. There are several zones I have never been in.

Doubtful. There are over 400k players now. Any quest not done are
either broken or so cryptic sherlock holmes couldnt figure them out.
The point is why does that somehow spoil the quests for you? Have
YOU done all the quests in the game?

I am staying FAR FAR away from all new games coming out until they
are proven and stable. I had a rough enough time beta testing EQ.

Please, your problem is simply one of perception. Just change your attitude
and play the game to have fun. The 'best' places to level and get loot
are not the whole game. And don't forget Luclin is coming out with tons
of new content.
