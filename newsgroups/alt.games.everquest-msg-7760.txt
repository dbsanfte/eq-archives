I once had a level 7 enchanter given 1k plat because he helped a guy out
giving invis and following him so he could walk through Freeport to retrieve
his corpse.  Talk about a twink, but the person was thankful, had the money

but I declined since it was my first caster class and needed to learn more
about it before I started doing something stupid.
