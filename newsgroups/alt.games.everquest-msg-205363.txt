Need to work on your history... Gygax stole from Dave Arneson and his
Chainmail game and grafted on the Tolkien world to a generic fantasy minis
game.  Gygax never had an original idea regarding AD&D, he just put his name
on everyone esle's work.  Tolkien wanted to write a pure high fantasy
adventure that used some elements of Germanic, English and French Myth (even
a little Russian thrown in there), but did add quite a few new elements of
his own.
