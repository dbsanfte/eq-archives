Not quite accurate...  You bought the DSK's from merchants for a short 
period of time.  You had to convert all the ones in your inventory 
yourself.  But they were found to be unbalancingly good for monks or 
something, and were removed from merchants (and possibly had their weight 
increased? Can't remember for sure).

Luckily, I still have about 30 of them spread amongst my alts. :) There 
was a fear that they were going to nerf existing kits down to 8 slots, and 
everyone made sure to camp with them empty before that patch, just in 
case, but they didn't. (Thank goodness, that woulda been a mess.)
