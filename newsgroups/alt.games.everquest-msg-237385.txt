Well, I don't have any druids or any characters at all on Cazic-Thule.

Heh, well, you *do* have a reputation for trying to start flame threads.  =P

If it really did happen, then it's a very strange anomaly.  As I said in my
previous post, by far the most common reaction of the EQ playerbase is to
totally ignore red players.  If one person went nutso on you for being red,
not much you can do - it's like someone harassing you for creating a
halfling druid because they have ruined the game.  People who honestly
believe that are in the extreme minority and represent the lunatic fringe of
EQ - they don't reflect the prevailing attitude of players.

Like I said, people don't hate PK-ers on blue servers because PK-ers simply
don't exist on blue servers.  Why hate something that isn't a problem?

People who grief - cause trains, ninja-loot, kill-steal - that's a whole
other category.  =)  But PK-ers... what PK-ers?
