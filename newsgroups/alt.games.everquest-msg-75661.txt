Ok, it can be a pointless thing when:

(a) puller yells "inc fruitbat! get ready to kill it!"
(b) wait for puller in range, assist, tash, slow... 
(c) hmm... those spells have casting times... what, about 6 seconds for 
    both maybe.  In this time, mob has reached group, tanks have gotten 
    aggro, rogue is in position, and the mob is about 1/4 dead.
(d) mob takes two swings instead of three! we saved a whole swing!
(e) See that wizzie over there?  Mob at half now, it go night-night.
  
Even without a nuker, the mob can go down so fast that your slow, 
although it cuts damage by a whole 30%, doesn't actually save very much. 
30% of a very small number is an even smaller number.

And it can be a bad thing when:

Druid_001 says, "WTF are you slowing for?  I'm using Thorns!"
