See, now I wish I would have written down that guys name that was at the
Tradeskill open forum at the Mpls Fan Faire a while back. When asked about
this exact question he responed and indicated, that you are more "likely" to
gain a skill up on items that are closer to your current skill level.

Now any of us jewlcrafters, and other tradeskillers, know that it stinks to
go out and buy 2 stacks of coponents for a close trival and get your skill
ups before you burn through the first stack.

This is why I tend to pick something out a few steps higher. Just makes for
less trips to the merchants.

That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.
