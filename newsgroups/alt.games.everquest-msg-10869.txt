No. You will be dubious to the merchants and KoS to all other Iksar NPCs to 
start.

The Overthere outpost and the Iksar merchant (who is indifferent to 
everyone, I believe) in The Overthere (near the Warsliks Woods zone) will 
be your only option for buying and selling on Kunark. And, of course, their 
prices are terrible!

Would you really want to hunt in the Field of Bone while bound in Paineel? 
Didn't think so. =)

You'll be fine in Neriak, but I'm not too sure about the necro guild 
itself. The ghouls that guard the entrance might kill you on sight, but I'm 
not positive on that. 

To be honest, I think going to the Field of Bone at low levels for a non-
Iksar is FAR more trouble than it's worth. It might not be bad for a twink 
who doesn't have to worry at all about cash, but if you are starting from 
scratch, I would strongly advise against going to Kunark at level 5-6.

Also, you don't get invis until level 8. Unless you have someone to invis 
you, you will most likely not make it to the Field of Bone alive.
