No, see, Faned's method never changed.  I will indeed pull at 100% mana
even.  90.  80.  70.  60.  50.  40.  Etc.  I don't have a goal for my
cleric's mana, I have a goal for the dungeon.  Either you play safe, for
instance keeping nearly a full tank of mana on your healer, or you play
hard.  You don't get to play hard and keep a full tank of mana at the same
time no matter how you try to explain it, because as you say, the mechanics
of the game are what they are.
