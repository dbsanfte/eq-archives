The tutorial is great for ramping up new *characters* quickly, but it's
not much of an improvement for new *players*.  The info was always
available through the very beginning hints and the help files you could
read through.  It's just now you go on a series of mini-quests to
actively acquire it rather than spending your first half hour in the
game reading the help files.

You get to learn the basic game functions and then you learn the
tutorial zone real well, but at the end of it you're still dumped in
your starting city with a "Okay, what the heck do I do now?" feeling,
just like you always were.

It's the same thing in EQ2.  I swear I ran around for a good 2 hours or
so when I made my character because I made a gnome.  You can't go into
the main city or advance in level until you become a citizen, and
becoming a citizen involves gathering tokens.  And for gnomes, the
tokens are drops in The Caves.  And that's all you're told.

The Caves are not accessible from the gnome newbie town.  The Caves are
not on the map.  The Caves are not on the waypoint list.  The Caves are
not a valid term to ask the guards about.  There were no other players
in the gnome newbie zone to ask.

So what and where the heck are The Caves?

As far as I could see with my first character, there was no way *at
all* for a new player to know how to progress in the game.

The answer was to go back to the docks and click on the bell for
"destinations outside Qeynos" and The Caves was one of the options and
then it would teleport you there.  I found it -- like I said, after
endless wandering around -- just by accident & frustration, clicking on
anything and everything I could.

I relate this story about starting off in EQ2 because I think the
tutorials in EQ and EQ2 are similar.  If that's the way it was for me
as a true new player to EQ2 then I'm sure that's the way it is for any
true newbies in EQ as well.  Tutorial teaches you how to play the game
reasonably well, and then dumps you out with no clue where to go or
what to do.
