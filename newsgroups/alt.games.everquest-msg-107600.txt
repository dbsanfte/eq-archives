I'd expect that you would only get the effect on the system the thing is
installed on.  Everything else should look a little darker, but otherwise
normal.  I've not seen these things yet, so this is a guess based on how I
suspect they work.

Here's my guess as to how they work:

The glasses are probably simply LCD shutters.  The drivers probably hook
into Direct3D (and OpenGL?  Do these things work with Quake?) so they can
modify parameters when the game tells Direct3D to render a frame.

When the game renders, say, even frames, the drivers don't modify anything,
and tell the glasses to close the LCD shutter over, say, the left eye, and
open the shutter over the right eye.  So, you see the even frames with just
the right eye.

When the game renders an odd frame, the drivers modify the parameters so
that the point of view is slightly to the left, and tell the glasses to
close the right shutter and open the left shutter.  You thus see the odd
frames with just the left eye.

When looking at another computer, since nothing is diddling the rendering,
both eyes would get the same image, and so no 3D effect.  Everything should
look slightly darker on the other computer, because each eye is shuttered
half the time.
