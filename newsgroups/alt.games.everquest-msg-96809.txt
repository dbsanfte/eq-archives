I would say more to make EQ as easy to play as AO and AC, as well as the
others coming up.  The bottom line is always the bottom line, and I'm sure
Verant/Sony don't want to lose subscribers because they "perceive" other
games are better because they are easier (i.e., no corpse recoveries, fast
recovery of health/mana, all characters play very similary, etc.).  I
wouldn't say I'm pissed off about the changes, but some seem odd to me, like
the no book for medding until a certain level (although 35 might have been
high).  And I would like to see some caution about all races being able to
be all classes (where it seems headed), because then what's the point?  But
then again, I am not the game designer, and time will tell if the majority
like the changes or they find something else.  Like everything I play, I
play until it's no longer fun for me, not based on what the ruleset is.
Hmmm...I think AO last about 60 days and AC lasted almost to the end of the
free trial.  EQ is lasting almost 3 years for me so far!  =) ... be safe
all, Bill
