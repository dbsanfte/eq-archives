Feh, Water is a fun zone!  But then again I lived in Kedge pre-Kunark and
our GL leveled from 30-50 in Kedge pre-Kunark.  Roaming around in 
Siren's Ghetto was fun to do also. :)  But severwide.age seems to be of 
the uniform opinion that I am crazed.

Air was a bit annoying but still kinda fun I think.  One can also get that
really obnoxious Named yellow con split from a suit with the little buddies
as well.  :)
