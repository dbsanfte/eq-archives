Less than a week? WOW! That's pretty quick. I'm slow as molasses! In about a
month of playing I think I got one of my characters to 21.

I've never been to Kurn's Tower. I just checked out EQAtlas to see where it
is. It's near the Iskar starting city? Can non-evil races get there without
getting killed on sight?

I went to the Estate of Unrest with a group last night. Had a blast there
got decent experience. I had never heard of that place before either. We had
a group that formed in Crushbone and worked the Throne Room for a while but
needed something more. One of our group members didn't have SoL, so we could
head to Paludal. This place was a perfect fit. We fought Death Beatles, Jack
O Lanterns, Tormented Dead, and Greater Skeletons. Definately a nice change
of pace from Paludal Caverns.
