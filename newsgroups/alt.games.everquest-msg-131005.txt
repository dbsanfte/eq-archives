Wow.  Top-posting _and_ bad advice.  I've found that the paths in most zones are more
or less useless, but the path in Kithicor is utterly useless.  Maybe Anthony was
trying to be cute, or maybe he really is ignorant.  Whichever.... Travel along the
wall in Kith, not the path.

Annie <--- Thinks the path in Gfay is pretty useless also.
