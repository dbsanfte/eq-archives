> and even there DAOC has to improve.  but its the next step along the
 path that will lead to the online games of tommorow.

OMG, I hope not. I played DAoC for a few weeks and *hated* it. If it's the
game of the future then I'm just screwed (and not in a good way)

 I actually stopped playing and then went back, a few weeks later, and it
STILL sucked.

I suppose that game choices are personal. I don't like DAoC, and you,
apparently, don't like EQ. That just makes us different, not enemies.

I've played EQ since it first came out, and I've loved it (and hated some of
the stuff in it, yes) ever since. Just because we don't share personal
preferences, so far as online games go, doesn't really mean much.
Personally, I never could see the "draw" of RvR. But that's just me.
Apparently you were bored with EQ. I'm not gonna beat you up for that, I'm
just saying each to his own.
