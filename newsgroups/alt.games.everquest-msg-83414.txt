So that's one of the unwritten rules about naming?  I thought that the rules
were fairly clear and concise.  There is certainly room for interpretation
on some of the rules, but I didn't see any at all when it came to trademarks
and copyrights.  Either the name is a trademarked/copyrighted name, or it is
not.  If it is, it is against the rules, regardless of how obscure it may
be.  Again, whether or not it would actually be changed, I don't know, that
is something that a GM would have to decide, however, that still does not
change the fact that it is against the naming rules.

I am not arguing whether nor not the name would be changed, I am just
stating that it is against the naming rules, period.
