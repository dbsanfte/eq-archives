This is easy for someone who has multiple alts to say.

However, for those who are not powergamers nor have the time to experience
grind 8 hours a day, everyday. Items like these are a nice reward for them.

Besides you should know by now, Levels are far more important in terms of
winning highscale Battles then these focus items.

The whole point was people bitch and whine when Verant makes a nerf.  Or
adjusts a Mobs AI to 'cheat' to win.  Hit thru walls etc.
Once Verant makes a move to make to Improve ALL the player base you guys
still come out and find a way to whine.. LOL
