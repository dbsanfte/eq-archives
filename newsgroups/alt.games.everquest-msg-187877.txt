This is really wierd, because my partner druid told me my FOE faded long
before hers even though she group buffed it...? This started happening after
the last patch. I will time it and bug report it if this is the case. Also
provide feedback to this group.

Maybe some of you should also check to see if some buffs have shorter
duration after last patch. I suspect the spells aren't changed, but some
chars are bugged or something really really wierd.
