You are forgetting one thing: spell resists. That 1260 damage is
useless if it never lands. Also,  the pet does do 'some' damage
in massive encounters. If a mob has several hundred thousand hit
points it is going to take a long while to kill. So a bunch of these pets
beating on it to add damage is worthwhile if you are not healing the
Main tanks.
