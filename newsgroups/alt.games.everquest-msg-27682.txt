Yes, don't play with Slate, as a newbie guard he is buffed to be resistent
to most magic of equal level and hits for around 120.
The guards at the Inn in Nro are actually even MORE resistent to magic, my
51 necro friend wasn't able to fear them at all, so she just blasted and
dot'd while her pet and I did our utmost to kick the crap out of them...oh
and he did the same to me, ignoring the pet completely :�/

Slate is 42nd level, I wonder how many 42 warriors it would take to kill him
:�)
I wouldn't try it unless you are grouped with a necro who can fear kite,
that way you won't get hit as much, of course, if the necro can stick fear
on him then there is no reason for you to be there :�)

I have stood my ground against Slate on a few occasions but only to let
someone get away, I then pull him to a zone, normally have around a bubble
of health left by the time I zone into WC.
