Howdy,

I've been busting my butt getting my druid up to porting.  I've been having
a blast and have found that I make a lot more plat hunting than doing
anything else.  I'm 24 now, 143 WIS.  I've equipped myself pretty well but
was wondering what I could do to improve a few slots.  I have 350pp in the
bank that I will spend but would prefer something I could either get for
myself or something common enough to stick my head in EC and do a quick
/auction WTB.  I don't want to buy player made jewelry because the wife is a
jeweler and I must support her in her endeavors (and I get it for the cost
of components as she trivializes stuff heh).

First, my stats.  I think I have been doing pretty good on these but welcome
any suggestions for improvements.  I know my abjure is low but that's from
soloing.  I can't figure out how to raise divinate any faster.

Offense 112
Defense 101  -- What is the max for these?  Should they be the same?

1hb 96 -- Is the max for this the (5 * level) + 5?  I cant seem to max it up
to that.

Dodge 64

Abjuration 64
Divination 43
Evocation 125
Channeling 125
Conjuration 122
Alteration 125
Meditate 125

Sense heading 125
Forage 125
Swimming 16  -- Eek!
Tracking 125  -- This is maxed right?

Stuff:

Left Ear Electrum Jasper Earring +2 WIS

Neck  Investigator's Badge AC1 +1 STR +1 WIS +1 INT +1 AGI +5 HP +5 Mana

Face     Woven Frost Giant Beard AC5 SV Cold 4, 1 Charge of storm strength
Waiting for wife to trivialize gold.  She's giving me a face thingy +4 STR
+4 WIS

Head  Lumberjack's Cap AC10 +5 STA
I like the AC but would prefer more wis.

Right Ear Electrum Jasper Earring +2 WIS

Left Finger     Silver Jasper Ring +2 WIS

Left Wrist Leather Wristband AC3
Would like a Chipped Bone Bracer here.  I think that's what it's called.

Arms  Ulthork Hide Arms AC8 +3 WIS -3 DEX

Right Wrist Ulthork Hide Bracer AC6 +1 WIS -1 INT

Right Finger Blessed Ring of Nife AC1 +2 WIS, 1 Charge of Greater Healing

Shoulders Braided Ivy Cords AC4 +5 WIS
I had reinforced shoulders here but on my way to buy my level 19 spells a
guy auctioned for a lizard scale mantle.  I asked how much and he said
150pp.  I said I was on my way to buy my spells and could only afford 75pp.
He agreed.  Cool guy.  I had to skip some spells but I got nice shoulders.
The next day, a guy in EK auctions that he has WIS items for sale.  We talk
but everything is massively expensive or for slots I don't need.  He asks
what I have for shoulders, I tell him and he offers to trade for the braided
ivy cords.  Straight trade, no additional pp.  1 less AC, but 2 extra wis.
I made that trade.

Chest  Split Paw Hide Tunic AC9 +10 Sv Poison
Need to replace this but I don't know with what.

Back  Studded Cloak AC5
I want the everfrost cloak (Icebear?) but haven't seen it for sale.

Waist  Purity Belt AC3 +2 STA +2 STR

Legs  Studded Leggings AC6
Feet   Studded Boots AC5
Haven't seen any wis leggings or boots for sale.

Melee
    Jaggedpine Crook +1 STR +5 HP +5 Sv Fire
  OR
    Fine steel morning star for damage
  OR
    Small Protection Diety AC2
Depends on what I'm fighting

Secondary Testament Of Vanear +10 WIS +10 Mana
This is awesome to be able to get at a low level.

Range  Small Wisdom Deity +2 WIS

Ammo
Can anything worthwhile go here?

I guess that's it.  Thanks,

Lewis
