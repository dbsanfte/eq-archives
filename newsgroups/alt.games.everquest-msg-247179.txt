Just for your information, from what I've played with so far with
Mounts...

The 10k horse goes as fast as someone without any AA run speed
enhancements.  I found this when I logged on my brother's cleric, who
has a 10k horse, and found that he was going significantly slower than
he would with all of his AAs.

The 30k horse goes as fast as someone with Run Speed 3.  I found this
with my enchanter as I was running along, figuring I'm not going
anywhere, clicked off the horse, and was going at the same speed
without any running buffs on.

The 60k horse I have no expiremented yet, but I can only assume Run 5
or SoW.

The 100k horse runs pretty fast.  I haven't put it against a bard,
though.  Maybe it's my height difference when I'm on my mount, but I
guess I need to play a fully equipped and AA'd bard with all the
enhancements to check out the Selo's feel.
