One thing you should look into is the Symbols of Innoruuk.  They are not that
dificult to get.  The final one in the line has 7 AC 3 WIS and effect Clinging
Darkness.  Definitely a niice neck piece.

One thing you should look into is the Symbols of Innoruuk.&nbsp; They are
not that dificult to get.&nbsp; The final one in the line has 7 AC 3 WIS
and effect Clinging Darkness.&nbsp; Definitely a niice neck piece.

<p>Well Allakhazams allow you to search for (as an example) all WIS
<br>equipment wearable by a dark elf cleric attainable at level 22. How
much
<br>more filtering do you need? The following URL is munged by being split

<p>Jewellery - pay an enchanter to make you rings, earrings, veil, etc
- if
<br>you want to do it yourself, learn jewellery but you'll still need to
get
<br>an enchanter to enchant the metals for you.
<p>Other WIS items:
<p>Splitpaw gloves (+2 WIS and +3 DEX I think...) drop off Tesch Mas gnolls
<br>in South Karana and other gnolls inside Splitpaw itself - you can group
<br>to fight these gnolls at the spires outside Splitpaw.
<p>The Testament of Vanear (+10 WIS, +10mana, offhand item) is doable at
<br>your level too. There are two parts - killing a corrupt Qeynos guard
in
<br>Highpass (Dyllin something) who drops one page of a book, and getting
<br>the other page and a book-container to combine the two in from Modooro
<br>Finharn in Qeynos. Now, you may have trouble with that part since you
<br>probably have bad faction, so I would check out Qeynos and do that
part
<br>first before camping Dyllin, especially since offing him will further
<br>lower your Qeynos faction. Since you've killed enough stuff to be
<br>dubious in Highhold, you may be OK, since IIRC one of the faction hits
<br>there is for Qeynos Guards. Not sure how you stand with Modooro, though
<br>- he's an Erudite, don't know what faction he's on.
<p>Then there's the Innoruuk symbol quests - you probably have the Disciple
<br>symbol by now, and the Regent symbol should be attainable in the near
<br>future - you can do all parts of the quest except killing some paladin
<br>at the end, for which you should be around level 30, but you could
maybe
<br>do it earlier with a group to help you, or a high level friend etc.
The
<br>proc on the symbol (Clinging Darkness) kicks in at level 15, after
all.
<br>Since you'll no doubt want this I'll not mention other neck items like
<br>the Blackened Iron Medallion, jewelcrafted necklaces etc.
<p>There also seems to be quite a few WIS items that may be attainable
at
<br>your level that drop in Kunark, mostly from Burynai in FoB or Kurn's
<br>Tower - Blockcutter gloves, Burynai Hide Boots, etc.</blockquote>
