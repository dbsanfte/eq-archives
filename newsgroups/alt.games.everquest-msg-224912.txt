I think it is pure coincidence, BUT on the Nameless last night there was
some big to-do in PoK having to do with Warriors and melee classes.  (I was
in Dulak, so didn't see if first-hand, just got bits and pieces in
guildchat.

The changes do seem interesting to me.  Looks fun, too.  Won't be able to
just 2box and set my monk on auto attack and watch everything through the
shaman's eyes.
