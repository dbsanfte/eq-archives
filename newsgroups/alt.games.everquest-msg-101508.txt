I've been looking at allakazam, and it looks like there's some loot in
the Warrens that would be cool to get.  I was wondering, as a DE Necro
am I KOS in Panieel at first?  I need to figure out if I need to reach
level 12 first, or if I can get bound, by the SoulBinder, plus will I be
able to buy level 12 spells there.
