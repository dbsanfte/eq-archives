Try this then.

Take a 49+ cleric to the DL/KC zone line, announce in both zones you are
rezzing for donations, and wait.

You can make a pretty good chunk of cash over a few hours.  Also, if you
hang around in KC you can keep tabs on the trains and see who causes the
biggest one.

My cleric is always broke, but then its my main and has a few alts to
support.
