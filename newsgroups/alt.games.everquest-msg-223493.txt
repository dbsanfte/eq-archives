I'd have to agree, with the mage one.  I've helped a mage, several SKs,
several PALs, uncounted rangers and druids, half a dozen wizards...  Mage is
the worst, just for the Air crown.  But Enchanter comes second in my
opinion; I've been working on mine since epics came out and I still haven't
got it done.

And one of the two drops I still need is the Vampire Essence.
