Let me be the barer of bad tidings. They have lame ass jobs and likely
bounce around from job to job and live at home still. In the last five
years I have noticed a sad trend where I work with guys 21-25 who all
still live at home and see nothing wrong with it and it tends to
reflect in their poor work ethic and lack of responsibility. I even
remember reading an article that mentioned this trend as so
significant; that sociologist are talking about adding another phase
to adolescence.

So sadly, when the boss jumps their ass, they will just quit and move
on to the next dead end job. These folks will never grow up. Mores the
pity for their poor parents and in the end I'm sure most will have
illegitimate children who are all sucking on the government tit.
