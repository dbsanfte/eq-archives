It occurs to me the simple way to research these would be to ask someone 
who knows...  So come on, make with the answers. :)

}Kinda right. The only problem is that you think you are changing the
}story, but you know dam well if you stop playing and come back that
}nothing has really change. 

Rewrite that as 'If Verant changes the storyline...'  I didn't mean that 
I, personally, was changing the storyline.

}>True, I don't disagree with you that new technology has a wide appeal.

}8) Diablo...hmmm

On the other hand... I got Tomb Raider III first.  Played it for about 
half an hour, and decided it was lame.  Ahh well.

}Personally I don't like people with more than one account , If 8
}charaters isn't enough you need help, unless of course you are PL you
}2nd account .

Well, well, fine, I don't like -you- either, then.  Pbbbbt.

}thats the problem, some people can't fantom the idea that it will end,
}and it will if not in 1 or 2 years then 3. but it will Sony is not
}stupid and have no desire to sink money into something thats only
}cutting even. They never have.

We agree on that much, the only disagreement is on how long until it 
ceases to be profitable.  I think 3 years seems likely.  But I wouldn't be 
terribly suprised if it made it 5 more years.  More than 5 years would 
begin to stretch my credulity a bit. :)
