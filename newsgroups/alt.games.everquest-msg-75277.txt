I recommend you head to Jakugg's Thurg website 
( http://www.servtech.com/~thegeorg/eq/thurgadin.htm )
and check the armor listing for dud enchanter pieces...
For comparison, druid Thurg boots are 8 AC, 13 CHA, 1MR/FR/CR, 10
mana, weigh 6.0 and have effect SoW. They are most definitely not on
my shopping list (which consists of bracers, circlet, tunic and maybe
lederhosen).
 
I'll start delving into Luclin gear one of these days, but for now I
am just content I have something to fill the tailoring gap between
wu's and reinforced cultural.
