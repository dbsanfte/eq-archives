Feign Death is worth piling practice points into. It's your 'get out of death
free' card. ;) To practice your Safe Fall, there's a very steep dune in South Ro
that runs parallel to the north edge between the zone crossing to Marr and the
NW corner of the zone. Just run up and down that to raise your skill level.
As for your weight, you should always be below 15 (until you get to higher
levels). Invest in or make Cured Silk, it makes a difference. :)
