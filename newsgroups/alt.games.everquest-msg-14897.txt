Nobody should interfere with me interfering. Case reopened!

I've heard that EQ is a 'multi-player' game. Rumor has it that people
interfere with each other (one way or another) on a regular basis.

I would have to say that more people were happy with my 'interfering' than
ones who expressed displeasure at it. Since the vat majority seem to enjoy
my 'interfering', I shall continue to do so until the ones who are angry at
the unrequested heals and buffs I throw them get me banned.
