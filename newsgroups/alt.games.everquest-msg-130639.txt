Here's a weirder bug: killed a mob, went afk just before it died, got
back and clicked the corpse and was told someone else was looting the
corpse. There wasn't a soul in sight, and the mob hadn't been dead for
35 seconds.

I have had the invisible player bug before. We went to Sol B once to
rescue a bindpoint deathlooped cleric, and I couldn't see him. I have
been in groups where I never saw one of the members till I zoned.
