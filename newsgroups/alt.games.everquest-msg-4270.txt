Blizard Dervishes and Pulsating Icestorms, which can be found both in
the Iceclad Ocean and Eastern Wastes.  They look exactly like normal
Snow Dervishes, so be sure to ID every one  you see.

Be careful, tho', the one I found in Iceclad Ocean (wandering near the
Tower, if that helps any) had about twice the hit points of an
ordinary Dervish, and was casting cold-based ice spells on me from
range.  Unless your'e in your high 30s, and a caster, it's probably
not a good idea to take on one of these boys solo.
