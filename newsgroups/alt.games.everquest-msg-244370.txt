So since a monk could tank almost as well as a warrior (almost, with the
higher DPS of the monk being the reason monks would sometimes be chosen over
warriors as the group's tank), that's justification for reducing their
tanking ability to under all other melee classes?  Don't believe the hype. 
There was one reason and one reason only for the monk nerf.  Too many monks. 
It was population control, pure and simple.

I can pull anything.  There's plenty of places where somebody else can pull
it better and/or faster, but I can still pull anything.  The "reset switch"
of an instant, on-the-run, feign death is the best pulling tool imagineable
(just ask a bard or rogue, both of which get a limited, but better, version).

Yeah, not much of a selling point.  But it's what monks have to offer.  :)
