It's a guaranteed 49.  It has almost 3k hp, a 50pt ds and
a max hit of 67, plus stun and DD procs.  It *is* a monster.
As the hardest epic to get (by design) it should be.

I'll be happy just to bet my 54 then my 60 water and a 
staff from kedge.  With it's BS and level 45-49 it does
nearly as much damage in groups as an epic.  It lacks in
the soloing department because of the disparity in HP and
the DS you can lay on it versus the epic HP/DS.
