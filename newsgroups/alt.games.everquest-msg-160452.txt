You indicated that it was a spoiler, so...

Thanks for the attempt to re-mystify it, however.

        ...Ronny

(BTW, the title of the series causes great confusion in Australia,
as we had a long-running soap called "Prisoner" here, apparently
released as "Cell Block H" elsewhere. It's pretty much always
necessary to make it clear that this is *The* Prisoner, not Prisoner,
and is *not the same series* when talking to an Aussie. "Prisoner"
was a soap set in an Australian women's prison, and the series
lasted something like ten *years*. Feel welcome to gratuitously
insult Aussie soaps, by the way, I'll cheer you on.)

P.S. anybody reading this - I have *not* seen the series, although
I've had it spontaneously recommended by several different people.
So anything I say should not be construed as a spoiler, as I lack
a clue on this issue. :-)
