I had a 4-boxer in my guild.  In fact, I have two of them in my guild.
Maybe not now, but that's not the story.

I hate 4-boxers and here are the reasons why:

1)They complain ALL THE TIME if you don't pull a mob "just so" or if you are
out of range of something! They also complain about pulling more than one
mob at a time or the aggro problems that would represent for their cleric
who...(see#2)
2)Their bots sit down RIGHT AFTER CASTING - then they complain about how I
wasn't taunting enough or something or they make something up to complain
about.

3)If a train comes, there is a good chance that the whole group wipes
instead of just the tank.
4)Downtime is exceedingly longer
5)It's boring playing with them, as you have to do things just right and
can't try anything new and you're just there for the grind.
6)They don't buy all of their spells typically.  The most recent problem I
had was this one 4-boxer had a druid, enchanter, and cleric, and NOT ONE of
them had any type of resist magic spell??  And it wasn't that they were
poor...

7)Characters in boxes typically have no decent equipment.  They look like
rag dolls.
8)4-boxers usually have little to zero DPS compared to one active character
for example: a four-boxing group of shaman, sk, level 38+ --> level 29 necro
consistantly KS's the group (they also have a chanter and a cleric) on red
mobs even.
9)They usually can't type to save a life, especially if they are in an
emergency.  For that problem though there are applications such as teamspeak
or roger wilco.
10)Boxers can't follow you NEARLY as fast and something almost always goes
wrong if you're in a bad area.  A lot of times they won't notice their invis
shorted out or sow fell off or one of their characters simply got stuck
behind a tree as they ran off.

Now for the real hate:
I was playing a warrior with this guy and his cleric was not being
controlled by humans... I'll just say that.. Anyway, I hated to have to chat
in order to get a heal.  The fun about being a warrior is watching yourself
get healed, not watching and healing yourself.  It may work best for you but
I hate it sooooo much and my god, it takes the fun out of being a warrior
almost completely.  This goes for two-boxers+ that have a cleric and a tank
and do both jobs; how can that be fun?

I'd have more to say but my anger is burning thin now so thanks for
listening,

Xeus
