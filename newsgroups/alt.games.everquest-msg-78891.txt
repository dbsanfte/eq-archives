Two ways of looking at haste, the way these figures are based is on the
improvement of the amount of swings over a period of time (as said earlier
or below) normally ten mins.
The other way is the effect on the delay of your weapon. So the Velium
Swiftblade *prolly* has a 36% haste effect on the delay of weapons and 40%
increase in swings over time, which would explain the two "difinitive"
figures.

Personally I'd rather have the haste percentage on the delay of the weapon.
It makes more sense to me to know that my 46 delay weapon is now a 41 delay
weapon when wearing the Lesser Guard of Haste.
