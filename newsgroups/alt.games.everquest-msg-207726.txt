Up in the top of the tower are three goblins, along with Deep.  Either 
of the two on the sides can become tainted/corrupted, and have roughly a 
6 minute spawn time.  The one in the middle has an 18 minute spawn time 
and is the sole PH for Lord Bergurgle.

I camped him with druids and with friends on and off for days, and then 
finally sat down and soloed the camp for 14 hours straight one day; at 
first I killed some of the other mobs, but eventually I got tired of 
that, pulled and killed -only- the PH, and just sat there with a kitchen 
timer set at 18 minutes, reading the paper, books, watching TV, doing 
chores... and then a kill on a deeply green mob every time the timer 
went off.

The best way to "camp" him is to log out near the tower, and wait for 
the next patch.
