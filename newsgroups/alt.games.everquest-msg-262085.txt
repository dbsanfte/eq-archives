I totally agree with their complaints concerning the nerf which
took away their charmed pets who hits for 1k,is there
anybody out there who wouldnt think about Enchanters as a
dps class? :p

Runes.net is a really fun message board,all these "playing since
1989","playing since Alpha","I am No.1 on Eqrankings" players
makes it amusing to read...not.
Glad they all leave(if they really do),EQ will be a better game
without them.
