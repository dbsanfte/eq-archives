I totally disagree with the DS includion in your DPS.  We have already
talked about fighting the mob from behind, somebody else tanking it, so your
damage shield adds NO extra damage.

Try it again without the damage shield and compare results.  To get more on
track with what we were talking about though, have somebody else (a warrior)
tank the mob, whilst you and the monk (ungrouped) both beat on it - see who
gets the exp

You killed it faster, but that doesn't mean you did more damage as such.  In
many situations your not going to be tanking, so including something thats
not always a part of your dps to the equation doesn't really add up for me.

When I group with guild warders, if theres no warrior in the group, I am
*always* the tank - but maybe thats just us (I actually very rarely group
with a warrior.. Id say i MA 99.5% of my exp camps
