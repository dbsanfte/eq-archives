Iksar and troll have about the same penalty and yes, it can be. You
get xp 1/5 slower but you regen hp twice as fast. Do the math. If you
are planning to be a troll character who can solo, such as an sk, its
sort of worth it until level 30 when you get a big lifetap (40 hp one)
Ogres have a 15 percent xp penalty, trolls a 20.

The int for an sk is kind of moot. Its a melee character first. On my
36 troll sk it seems I have a huge mana pool and my base int is like
70 or 75. Basically for either race put all the points you can into
stamina first and I think on the ogre make sure agil is at least 75 or
more.
