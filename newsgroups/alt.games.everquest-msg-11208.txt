All I can say is that try this out yourself. Has happened on other zones
too. And I did con those Ogres (in this particular case) and they were very
indifferent to me. And I know that no skeleton attacked me it was Ogre that
somehow noticed me as I walked so near him that I almost stepped on his
toes. One thing that came in my mind is that if it was skeleton that saw me
and had some kind of hate which in case launched agro on those Ogres? Don't
know but those experiences have taught me to be very careful even when
invisible =)
