My "vendor alt" will go to the bazaar and stay there, permanently. The
only time the 45 minute "wait" will matter is when I have another load
of stuff to dump on him, or he's bought something I need to pick up.

80? I'll be surprised if it's not more like 800. I'd imagine that an
awful lot of people will end up still using East Commons (or the local
server equivalent) as the default bazaar once it turns out that you
have to click on dozens or hundreds of "unattended PC vendors who
cannot haggle or trade" just to see what's available.

Has there been any hint that the /auc command will be depreciated in
non-bazaar zones, post-Luclin? If so, we can look forward to (even
more) griping about people using /shout to sell items in East
Commons...
