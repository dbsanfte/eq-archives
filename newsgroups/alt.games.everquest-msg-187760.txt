Thanks. *rolls eyes*

I can still rattle off the gravitational constant without searching my
memory very hard, so let's just say even being a good four years out
of university physics classes I was still aware of the formula. :-p

However, even if I hadn't been, if someone showed me a picture of Neil
Armstrong bouncing around on the moon, and told me he weighed less up
there, I'd accept it. I wouldn't demand to hear the formula and
declare the other person a fraud if he couldn't come up with it....

Maybe that's it! Maybe James is a moan hoax proponent. It would
explain a lot. :-)
