  $10?  That's a nice made up figure.  Try at least $70.  I paid $90
to purchase my copy (I could have got Windows Me for cheaper slightly,
but I've heard enough bad things about it to avoid it... there were
also a few places that were selling Win98 for cheaper, but they all
had poor customer ratings).

  This is what I figured Verant's course of action would be, if any.
They cover their asses legally, but it really does nothing to placate
those of us who were forced to upgrade at considerable cost with no
warning during the Christmas season.

  There's no customer service here, it's just a token gesture to make
absolutely certain some bored EQ player/lawyer doesn't make trouble
for them.
