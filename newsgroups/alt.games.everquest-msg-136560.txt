    I've bought several pieces of Kunark armour which I then sold
immediately to a vendor for more than I paid. Ditto with JC items and a few
Lower Guk drops for which I knew the vendor prices (and the seller clearly
didn't).

    Best deal on our server: some poor sod mispriced an item. Grats buyer on
Fungi Tunic for 25 pp.

    Item we can't believe was on a vendor: Zlandicar's Talisman. Yep, you
too can buy your ST key in The Bazaar for the low, low price of 180 K!
