But "inconvenienceing the least amount of people" every day for a week
adds up to more than an inconvenience. Its effectivly denial of
service.

Once a month... sure ... patch and put the Aussies and nightowls out
no problem... patch 5 days in a row... now your effectively denying eq
service to a group of subscribers for a straight week with no
consideration or compensation. And they do this reasonably  regularly.

If they've got a major block of patching to do, rotate it, better to
effect a lot more people one day then a significant group of the same
people every day for a week straight.

Its 'tyranny of the majority', and its unfair.
