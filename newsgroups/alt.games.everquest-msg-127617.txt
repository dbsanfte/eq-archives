Just a quick announcement.. I've written a map utility that lets you view
.MAP files (vector maps that someone has created, I'm not sure who -
Mapfiends?  I found them on the Web) and pan and zoom them in and out.. good
for quickly finding a location.

It also supports accessing your EQ log file and drawing a little X on the
map if you're running MapX on a separate computer - this is really handy
when you're exploring a zone you're not familiar with or when you're, well,
lost.  It works for multiple computers too so if you have 3 players playing
on a home LAN you can see where everyone is if they all press /loc..

You can find it here (with screenshots):

It's free and comes with source so if you're concerned I'm trying to steal
your account you can examine and rebuild it from source if you like :)  It's
not a cheating or hacking program, just a tool for viewing maps, but I
personally find it really handy..
