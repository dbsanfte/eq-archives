Reference for this? some citation of some kind?

No, I thought not.

No, you just claim they can't be used to crack into an EQ account. For "proof"
of this you give some story you heard through a friend of a friend who thought
their account was compromised, but it was their own error.

================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
