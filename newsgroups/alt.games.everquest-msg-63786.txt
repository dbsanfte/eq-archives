Howdy fine ppl

Now with SoL and prices going down on the known stuff hopefully :) what
would you recommend for max damage and taunt with around 20k to spend? I was
thinking jademace in PRI and venom axe in SEC. I have no haste items; should
i get a crap item like fbss and some cheaper weapons instead? Im the only
tank in my guild and weï¿½re very determined to do Kael for a long time. I
dont even have Cobalt gauntlets, which are 3k on drinal server. Those are
13ac more than crafted for very little money.
