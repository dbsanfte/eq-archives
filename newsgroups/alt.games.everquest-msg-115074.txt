Depends on the level of the guild and how "uber" they are. Our guild
still does random with a level weighting to it. (Generally only people
who can use it and will equip it roll level x 10 to 1000). We're not
uber though. Around 80 members, roughly forty of them above level 50. We
raid Kael, Icewell, DN and the Hole pretty often. Successful? Not sure
how one measures that. Guild has been around for more than two years now
and everyone seems pretty happy. I call that successful. And I also call
it too high to be called a n00b guild where people roll on rusty maces
from Orc 1. We're talking Thurg quest armor here. Not very uber, but
pretty nice anyway.
