Never give money to any guild as a collection of fees, you should not
be a member of any such guild. A legit guild does not need to collect
fees since the only thing that actually costs money beyond what gem
looting pays for is sky, but usually rare gem drops like BDS are
resold (possibly in jewelered form) back to guild members on a first
come first serve basis to raise the money for Sky.

So it doesn't matter if you hear the guild is trying to rip you off or
not, no legit guild ever will collect money since they don't need it.
Even periodot concerns of clerics are taken care of by money and non
uber gems on mobs.
