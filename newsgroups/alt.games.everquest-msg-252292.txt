RyGorr at the fort have some severe troubles with the wall; they tend to 
get stuck on it (instead of pathing around thru the gate) if you aren't 
being very very careful about it.  Then they tend to warp out to near 
the tree.  This can very easily end up aggroing people standing around 
out there, and for no reason a casual player not highly familiar with 
the spot would guess at.

A bard, who specializes in pulling large groups of mobs while aggroing 
each as little as possible (he wants them to all stick to his pet), is 
the guy most likely to have this happen to him.  Personally, I'd ask him 
to come out straight down the middle, and you stick way over in the 
corner near the Coldain huts, hopefully not near his prey's flight 
paths.  A wide berth and a little mutual respect and it shouldn't be 
much trouble.
