Because setting themselves up as an online brokerage house would cause a
helluva lot more CS issues then it would solve, and their CS isn't worth a
bucket of warm spit as it is.

Not to mention the potential liability they're putting themselves at risk
for.  "I didn't authorize that charge!  I'm not going to pay it." ... that
sort of thing.  And that's putting your fingers in your ears and chanting
"Lalalalalalalala" that someone's information somehow becomes unsecured.

Nope.  Much easier to do this sort of thing if they're executing transaction
of behalf of themselves.  THAT they're used to.
