I'm assuming you already all have keys (Prod from LOIO, Xalgoz fang)
and know where the zone itself is in OT, it's not that obvious unless
you've been already or have read spoilers.  The zone seems a mixture
of undead and not so neither form of invis helps much once you're
inside.

Anyway, expect aggro the MINUTE you zone in (ie: stuff hitting you
before you have fully zoned in on a slow connection) so keep the
Chanter healed and let him mez so you can get your bearings.

Each wing requires a key and you need to kill mobs to get the key,
various portals dotted around the zone take you from spot to spot
(back to the zone in for example) but the only way out of the dungeon
itself is gate or port.

Some of the rugs are pit traps (I think the ones that sit at an odd
angle are the traps, avoid any that you can just to be safe) and some
of those are bugged, instead of dropping you into the pit area as I
suspect they are designed to you instantly 10k to your death.  One of
the sets of steps at zone in is false and you will fall into the pit.
Kill the zone in mobs, lev the party and float down into the pit to
get a taste of what kind of mobs to expect and some decent xp to boot
as the zone has a high experience modifier. 

North Wing is really very easy if you have a level 60 puller as the
average mob level isn't very high (some of them are green to 60 ISTR)
although you do tend to see a lot of SKs - expect to see the pullers
HPs drop like a stone on bad pulls.  North Wing key shouldn't take you
very long to get at all.  The other wings are a bit tougher, I'd leave
them alone with that group.
