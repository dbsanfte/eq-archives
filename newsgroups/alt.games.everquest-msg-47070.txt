I just got to warrens for the first time.
I have played EQ for a bit over a year. I just moved from Xev to Fennin Ro
and this time i decided not to go to the 'usual' places to level. I want to
experience the places i didn't do with my first char.
I'm lvl 16 chanter (no oops actually 15, managed to die once on the paineel
guards :)). I have never ever visited warrens before, and actually i just
ran the optional patch for the first time ever to be able to zone to
warrens. :)
I scouted a bit near the entrance with invis. Seems that everything near is
very green to me.
So to get to the point. What kind of group should i gather here? I'm already
in a guild with post 50 chars, even some 60. Many of them have twinks near
my level and i think we could put together a nice group here for the kicks
of it...
Any possible blue/high_green camp to break solo?
Any possible drops as solo?


I tried to search the web for tactics for warrens but seems that very little
is written about this place.
The place was almost empty when i visited there. Few random evil erudites
from paineel and some lvl54 wizzie. (what in earth is a 54 char doing down
there anyway? Isn't there trivial loot code in place here?-))

Any forum about warrens tactics?

I think i have grown up twisted and becoming a munchkin
(http://home.mira.net/~tosh/humour/realmen.htm ) as i want to know a dungeon
before fighting there. :)
