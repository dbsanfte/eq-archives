Yeah, there are probably still screenshots of it up somewhere. They
had some giant god models come and duke it out or something and as
they were more and more beaten by the other one they shrank more and
more. They had innoruuk and mith marr or something and innoruuk was
being kneeled to by dark elf players in Nek first or something. Then
at end some big giant halflign showed up far bigger than the other
ones.

Least I think those were in beta.
