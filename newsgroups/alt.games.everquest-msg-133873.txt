One of the most common problems with ZA is that XP loads the network
drivers in parallel with the startup programs (to speed up boot time),
and unless you take a pause at the log-in screen, ZA will load before
the network drivers has. That can lead to all sorts of interesting
problems, from ZA reporting nameless versionless programs trying to
access the internet (network handshakes), to that if you have dynamic
IP updating the IP number fails.

I like ZA, but at least the free version does often cause problems. It
might be worth checking out some of the free alternatives, such as
Tiny, or even buy a commercial firewall such as Nortons (I never
thought I'd recommend a Norton product for _anything_, but truth be
told the viruskiller and firewall seem slow-but-decent).

None of them is perfect, though. It may be a good idea to get a
hardware firewall. It's the only way to be sure.

Wrt XP's inbuilt firewall it is hopelessly difficult to configure -
unless you're a network wiz you're unlikely to get good protection
from the XP firewall.

And a firewall is a good idea. There's *armies* of russian and korean
h4xx0rz scanning ports with known security problems, associated with
known trojans, or with PCAnywhere. 
My firewall stops about one such attempt per day.
