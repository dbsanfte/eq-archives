No death penalty takes the sense of danger away,maybe retrieving your
corpse from Sol B without your gear was a little harsh,but with the
corpse summoner they went too far for my taste,not to mention EQ2
here again.

I should have emphasized the SHORT DISTANCE aspect more,sure
I hate zoning as anyone else.

Not very familiar with tanks,just know  monks a little better,cause my
guild leader's main is one - looks like an awesome solo'er to me.
I choose Inquisitor in EQ2 cause I always like to play healers,it  is
said he is one of the not so capable soloers,if that is true I cant
imagine what other classes are capable of with soloing.

My WoW experience is very limited and some time ago - tried a 
Shammy and Cleric typ,leveld both to 15 or so - I remember hitting
a wall around level 15 which no longer let me finishing (solo)quests.

There are also tons and tons of conveniently spreaded out mobs in
outdoor zones,why bother with Dungeons for xp ?

Depends where you go,remember this paragraph was about ease of
leveling.

Canceld my subscription in May '07.

The armour is very affordable,just stop by at every root or ore - low
level loam or roots are going from 10s to 20s - you dont even need to
find much rares for selling to make some cash - or learn Alchemy,
especially great for scout  classes - make your own spells and
fill almost half of your equipment slots by yourself.
At level 35 my very first char was able to twink my first alt with a
18p horse.

Hm,cant rememebr wearing a single piece of tradeskill made stuff on
my mains in EQ1 (70/600 Cleric,70/700 Ranger),although I had every
tradeskil except tailoring at 250 or higher,Smithing was 300 even.

Quillmane and AC were easy with a Ranger,the problem with Quillmane
was more the drop rate of the cloak,I wanted it badly for my
Cleric,and visited SK over and over in the run of the years but QM
never dropped it.
The thing with long camps is if they yield a reward worth the effort
its sooo  satisfying,I regret no minute of the 3 weeks 
I camped Hate with my Ranger for the Ranger Epic,years later
I was happy to volunteer for the slower role when there was no
Shammy or Enchanter to be had (again).
Eq2 completly fails in this regard,who cares for gear when one can
level up regardless of what one is wearing.
Speaking about gear,maybe its just me,but the gear in EQ2 is missing
something,its not "sexy" as to say so,a proc which procs 1.8 times 
a minute ? - I loved my Cleric in EQ1 especially for the awesome proc
from the summoned hammer,see it going off on and on and this with
spell critical AAs maximized.  :)

Thats why I play(ed) it ,a rl friend let me play for free,though atm I
have deleted it from my harddisk out of boredom and reoccuring
bugs.
And if its an improvement over EQ1 I am uncertain,they added
all kind of functionalities but they make no sense in the big scheme
and are just there for themselves with no regard to the core game
which is monster bashing and raiding.

Its true I have a very old mashine(AMD 1.33 GHZ,512 MB),but every
single bug or frequent crash I experienced so far can be found
described by other users too in the SOE forums,so it cannot be
just my low end mashine and sometimes I can play for hours without
rebooting or crash.
