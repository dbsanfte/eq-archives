    Wince wince wince Torpor GTG. Shaman mana regen is so fast it leaves
almost every other class in the dust.

    Mages have the exact same mana regen rate from self-buffs as a cleric,
AND can summon and eat t-rods (which are net mana gains) at will. No excuse
for them to be lower on mana than the clerics.

> And "pathetic mana regen rate".. how many classes regen mana faster?

    Of the pure casters? *All of them*

    In addition to the buffs everyone on a raid has, necromancers have lich
line, shamans cannibalize, enchanters have ToT and AA to get to full mana,
mages have a self-buff with the same mana regen as a cleric's, wizards have
epic rune and Harvest, druids have PotG (same mana regen as a cleric's
self-buff) and if outdoors have even more self-buffs to use. If you don't
include raid buffs and effects (so no t-rods or C3), the cleric is on the
bottom of the heap alone.

    EQ has been designed with clerics as the primary healers, and our mana
regen has been carefully controlled because of it.

    Shaman + Torpor = unlimited mana. Torpor changes a shaman like no other
spell changes a class. And necro lich line is very high mana regen - Arch
Lich is 35 mana *per tick* at a cost of 53 life per tick. (To put in
perspective, C3 is 15 mana/tick.)
