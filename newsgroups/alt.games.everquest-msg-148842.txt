}    Until recently, tipping 500 pp and buying materials for armour that I
}have to sell to a sub-optimal race/class combination (no Rallos Zek dwarf
}warriors, so no Heraldic for them!) would have been folly I couldn't afford.

You do realize that you can do imbued combines for deities other than your 
own, right?  You just need to get someone to imbue the gems for you...

}It's only since I got the Shei shears and a pile of superb/flawless
}rockhopper hides that I've been making steady cash. Given the constraints on
}my time due to raiding, most XP is done wherever the XP is most efficient,
}NOT wherever the loot is best. And Luclin, in general, has a lack of
}droppables you can sell for cash that drop in raid areas.

I think you're missing my point.  The point is that, if you've invested 
the time to hunt 3.6 million LQ pelt-dropping animals, you could also 
invest the time to level up a chanter.  If you've invested the money to 
buy 3.6 million leather paddings, you can afford to invest 500pp.  You do 
add the Shei's Shears that I hadn't thought of, but if you are high enough 
level to fight in Ssra and loot them, you are high enough level to knock 
over a few hill giants and get some plat.  The fact that you hadn't been 
fighting hill giants really is no reason anyone should drop their prices, 
is it?  Personally, I'd be glad to do it in exchange for a couple of 
superb hides... :)

}> especially
}> considering your potential return on investment, here.  Those pieces made
}> from brellium -do- go for multiple Kpp...
}    Not the old stuff. The new stuff sells nicely, when you can find a
}buyer. Our server's leading smith, Zopharr (max skill smith on his dwarf
}cleric main, maybe four points from max skill smith on his ogre SK alt) has
}made maybe a score or so of Underfoot plate items, mostly bracers. If I look
}around at a raid I bet I could count a score of visible Heraldic plate
}pieces on warriors.

It might be a good idea to look for buyers, -then- make the armor.  That 
way, you're not stuck with some big investment piece that you never find a 
buyer for.
