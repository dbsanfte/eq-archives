Cool.  I'm not really taking sides on this, since I don't know the first
thing about databases, aside from what I use in Star office.  I just wanted
the reasons you thought he was wrong.  "You don't know shit" just isn't
convincing as an argument; and in a public forum like this, you've got to
convince us as well.  Well, maybe you don't have to, but it does help.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
