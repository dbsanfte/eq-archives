Fourth-quarter (Oct-Dec) losses were about three times what they were
expecting (111 billion yen rather than 40 billion or so) cutting their
*annual* profit by the gap (say 70 billion yen). So their profit for
the year was down to under half what was expected.

The basic reasons given are:
- Some of Sony's stuff isn't selling very well.
- The yen is up, so they get less money for stuff sold overseas. (This
  includes the USA of course... anywhere but Japan).
- Some re-organising they did cost more than expected.
