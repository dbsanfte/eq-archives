    Don't know if this counts as a proper citation, but here goes:

See through your eyes: any player with Bind Sight can do this, I assume a GM
can as well.

See communication: from the Waking the Sleeper incident, where the guild's
guildchat was used as evidence against it. It has been *ASSUMED* that the
Head GM at the time was monitoring guildchat to see if they knew what they
were doing was an exploit.

Posession: GM event in the Dreadlands where a high-level Wizard KS'ed the
prize. After being deathtouched by the GM, and still not relinquishing the
prize, the player was forcibly logged out, and was logged back in by the GM
to hand the items to the deserving parties. I believe we hashed that one
around on the newsgroup.
