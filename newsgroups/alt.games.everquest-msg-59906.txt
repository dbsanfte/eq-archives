    I'm no quad-kiter, so I can't tell how tough these are or when they
green, but I have heard of folks quadding the birds and the raptors in
Timorous Deep. If your wizard friend needs help finding a place to hunt,
have him turn to www.graffe.com - I'm willing to bet in the soloing or AE
Kiting forums will be the exact answers he's looking for.
