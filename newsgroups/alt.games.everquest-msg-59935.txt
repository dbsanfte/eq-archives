To start with, LCD's are very bad for video games.  The graphics will look
strange because of the LCD's.

Second, integrated video (attached to the system chipset) usualy means
crappy video performance, so your graphics will take yet another hit in
performance and quality.

I've looked through the computers you've choosen, and I can safely say EQ
will run very very badly on these computers, but it will (probably) run.
