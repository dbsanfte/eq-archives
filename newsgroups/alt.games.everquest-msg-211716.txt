For myself, I don't claim to be either.  I was at one time a Christian,
though recent events have driven me away from that belief.  Toward that end,
I've read the Christian bible through a time or two, though not recently.

I'm not a witch-hunter either, though I have read the Malleus Maleficarum.

Nor am I necessarily an 'atheist' .... there's still a rather large chunk of
thought in my mind that finds it a bit disturbing to think that all of the
intricacies of life on this planet is just happenstance.  So given that, I
would classify myself as a-theist (without theism) ... I'm just not sure
what that theism might be at this point in my life.  'Agnostic' may be a
better description, but not much.

But there is merit to what you say ... I know a lot of people who claim to
be Christians who haven't read the bible.  I also know a fair number of
agnostics and atheist who have read it through several times, purely for the
sport of arguing with their perceived enemy.

However, I don't personally know of a single person who's a fan of fantasy
writing who hasn't read LoTR.  Maybe Tolkien is God, after all.
