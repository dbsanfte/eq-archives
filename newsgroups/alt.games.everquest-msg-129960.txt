Greetings group.

A duo of enchanter + shaman not the first that comes into mind, but I
imagine it could be rather ok.

At 29+ the setup would provide:

The two pets (dog-dog and the shield) could tank/melee, and with buff
galore from the two casters, they can be rather good.
The duo has the uber slow/haste combo, stacking DOTs, healing and Sow, and
on top of that crowd control. 
HP Regen and Mana regen makes life easier too.

The weak point is damage dealing/tanking from the pets, but I imagine it is
doable... The shaman has some tanking abilities if the going gets tough.

Anyone tried it ? Comments/suggestions welcome
