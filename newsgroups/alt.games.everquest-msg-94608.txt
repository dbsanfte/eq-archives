Test:  Level 4 Enchanter uses a Lizard Blood Potion to
gate to the maze in the new Cazic-Thule.

Results:  After standing there at the gate-in point
for 20 minutes, she had not aggroed anything (even
while sitting), and had seen not a single mob
(neither static nor wanderer).

The area appears safe.

Then, just for fun, I had her cast invis and run to
the zone.  She made it without incident.  She passed
quite a few mobs, but none saw through invis (which
is *not* necessarily a safe assumption, many things
in the new CT *do* see through invis).
