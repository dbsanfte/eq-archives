Well for people that profess to have such high ethics regarding fair eq game
playing why dont you have equaly as high ethics against such arrogant
scorning.  Your words are as bitter as acid and against what? someone that
asked a question about buying platinum?  You have no thought of being
considerate, gentil, patient.  Especially with someone that is obviously new
to the game.  Are you confusing your ambitious efforts in eq with real
ethics?
Your pray on the weak and feable is a real display of ethics isnt it?  Ya
your a real holy roller.
