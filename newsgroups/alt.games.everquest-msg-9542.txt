I enjoy it. I would tell you not to get it if your significant other is not
into gaming. It is fun and can draw you in real easy. There is less
roleplaying than I hoped for, but the people you meet and the good times
make up for the 45 minute corpse runs and kill stealings that inhierently
happen.

Do me a favor and do not start a Druid. There are too many already.
