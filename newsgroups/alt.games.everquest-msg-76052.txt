Aye, and sadly it works both ways, too. For a real heartbreaker, go to
DL to try to get the mountain giant patriarch to spawn for the giant
monocle for the Warrior epic. To do it "properly" the conventional
wisdom states you should wipe out the fort, then go to the two houses
and kill the giants there, and every wanderer in between, since the
Patriarch (fairly rare spawn) can pop in any of those locations.
Unfortunately, it can take a little while to run to those two houses,
kill the pops, plus wanderers, and make it back to the fort.

You do that, get back to the fort, and find a couple guys have moved in
and are killing the giants in there as they pop.

What do you? Well, you leave. You either come back to try another day,
or you go just farm the two houses and hope to get REALLY lucky. But
once you leave, the camp's up for grabs, so I figure no good whinging
about it.
