That's one of the reasons I prefer to have clarity when I'm main tanking.
Attacking for me includes taunting twice, and if I've got the mana for it,
leasing with a stun.  Good for getting their undivided attention.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
