Just to add on, that there is 4 colors of bridles, Brown, Tan, Black, 
and White. And about 5 different types, starting with rope, and finshing 
off with Ornate Chain. The only differance in them is running speed, the 
ropes are abit slower then run 3 in AA while the Ornate Chain is as fast 
as spirit of cheetah (or so i'm told). What purpose do you wish to buy a 
horse? Most casters buy them due to them having the abilty to med while 
casting spells and also they don't get the extra agro from sitting.

Ornate Chain is only droped off Bosses such as 
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7898.

There is also a slight differenace in a single type of them, such as a 
rope tan or brown is 10k even for my gnomish warrior but another 1125 
higher for a rope white or black. Yet they all run the same speed.
