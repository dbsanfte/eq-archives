As others have pointed out, the starting stats don't make much of a 
difference by the time you get up to the level where you'd notice them. 
All brand new characters are pretty much the same. By the time you get 
to the levels where the classes really begin to differentiate from each 
other (early twenties) you *should* be able to save up enough plat to 
buy some mid-range gear in the bazaar for all your slots that will 
obliterate your starting stats. At the high end they will only be a 
distant memory. So pick the one you like best that makes you happiest 
and go for it.

As to megello, particularly if you think you will play the character 
long term, never too soon to start. Make a profile and load it up with 
all the newbie gear you have. It's kind of a fun hobby, and updating it 
with all your new acquisitions is something fun to do when the servers 
are down, plus it lets you see your total stats improve as you upgrade. 
Don't be ashamed of being a newer player and not having Time gear yet. 
Set up your profile, get your frog hopping out into that swamp, and just 
enjoy.
