Since you are the one who brought Freud into the thread, I think I 
should point out that while Fear-of-Castration is a powerful emotion, 
there is no call to project it onto your pets. Believe me, they mind a 
lot more not being allowed to go out and use their reproductive organs 
for what they are for, than they do losing them. If you cannot see this, 
then I'm afraid I'll have to join the growing ranks of those who feel 
very sorry indeed for any animal that ends up in your care.

PS. Projection != Empathy
