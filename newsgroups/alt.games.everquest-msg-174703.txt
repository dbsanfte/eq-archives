You use a key to put it on the keyring.  Not all keys will go on the
keyring, for example, the Hole key will not.  To see what keys are on your
keyring, type /key.  So, when you zone into Old Sebilis for example, your OS
key automatically goes on the keyring, you don't have to do anything.  Next
time, you don't need to hold the key, or even have it, you will be able to
zone in.
