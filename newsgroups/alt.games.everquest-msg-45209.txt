If you have Camo, then swim to the firepots in TD and port to Cabalis, then
camo up and run thru the city to FOB, you can even get a bind there at the
zone line, although bind right outside Kaesora would be handier.

I'd hunt in Kurns instead of out in FOB, won't be so much running around.

Then again, I'd go to Overthere or Lake of Ill Omen instead of FOB anyway,
both full of mobs ranging blue to yellow from level 1 up to 30.  Rangers
particularly would be handy in Overthere where the distance between mobs
makes finding one in a good con range is more difficult than killing it!
