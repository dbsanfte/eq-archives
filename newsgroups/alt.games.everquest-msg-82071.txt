Thank you for that thoughtful post, Halfpole. I know that english isn't
everyone's first and primary language. I realize that there are other people
who play the game who speak French, German, Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic and
Swahili. I've never met any of them, however, in my travels through Norrath,
and I'm amazed that you have, but then, I'm on Innoruuk and you're on a
different server, where things are different as well. I'm also aware of the
"global community" thing (as anyone who uses the web much at all SHOULD be),
but I still don't understand why people post in a language that probably 90%
of us don't recognize or read, if they're trying to get an answer. You gave
me some enlightenment with the "don't feel comfortable enough with their
secondary language skills" part of your post, I thank you for that. I, too,
would likely feel quite uncomfortable trying to ask a question or reply to
someone in my 12th grade Spanish. But I also cannot see myself posting
something, in English, to a NG that is obviously German or Egyptian or
Hebrew, etc, without a "sorry for my butchering the language folks, but I
have a question" disclaimer. None of these folks do that. Although you also
enlightened me with the spam part of your post. If it's really spam, then I
suppose I'm, not missing much.

I don't mean to be difficult, I just don't understand. And I feel like I
should. And when I feel that way, I get pissed at *myself* ;)

thanks,
Dark
