Using the legacy claim, you can get three random pieces of Defiant 
armor, and a Defiant weapon, "suited to your level"

Trying to figure out what levels you need to be to get which armors.  I 
tried this with several different toons, with the following results

At 2, Crude (0/10)
At 24, Simple (5/20)
At 25, Rough (15/30)
Haven't gotten Ornate
At 51, Flawed (37/50)
At 57, Intricate (48/60)
At 65, Elaborate (59/70)

The split at 24/25 is particularly informative.  24 is four levels above 
the top end for Simple, and 9 levels above the required for Rough, but 
not enough... while 25 is.   5 levels short of the cap perhaps?  This 
would mean

1-14 Crude
15-24 Simple
25-34 Rough
35-44 Ornate
45-54 Flawed
55-64 Intricate
65-85 Elaborate

I don't have any data points that contradict this, and it seems simple 
and consistent

Other notes: the claims produce unique pieces, which is to say, if you 
already have one piece of that exact type of armor, or that exact 
weapon, you won't get another.   If there are no remaining pieces, the 
claim won't go thru at all.

If you have, for example, a Flawed Defiant chest piece, and a claim will 
get you Ornate Defiant, you can still get the chest, it doesn't check 
the other levels as being the same thing, whether worse or better than 
what you're entitled to.

It also doesn't check whats in the Shared Bank.

If you want to get two Chain bracers, well, there's only one.   Stick 
one in Shared, then you can get it as a claim.

Since the stuff isn't No Trade until you put it on, it may be possible 
to borrow pieces you don't want in order to force the system to give you 
the specific pieces you do want as claims.

To fully outfit a new toon in Crude Defiant, you can make multiple dummy 
toons of the same class, claim their three armor and a weapon, put in 
shared bank, make new toon, take the already claimed pieces out, repeat 
till you have a full set.

Note: Chain has ONE bracer, at least at the lower levels.   This means 
to get the second one, you have to put one in the bank, as I mention 
above.   Funny thing, Plate has (at least at the high end) THREE 
different bracers, each slightly different.  Similar machinations may be 
needed to get the one or two you actually want, although you can also 
get all three if you want, and swap them around as the situation 
demands.  As one helps Chromatic damage, which only Clerics among the 
Plate classes seems to have, its unlikely anyone really wants all three.
