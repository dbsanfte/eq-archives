So, I'm thinking I would like to try and organize an open raid on
Luclin server.
I've never been involved in a raid, but thought it would be fun to try
and organize even a large group if not a small raid. Nothing big or new
or exciting. Just a big ass rush through Rivervale with as many Iksar
and allies as I can muster, for laughs.  And by openly organizing this,
perhaps Rivervale can get some sort of defense worked up.

Thoughts?
