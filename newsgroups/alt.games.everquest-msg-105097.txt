Group heal would be nice for druids, except like you say it would step
on the toes of the one thing paladins can do in some situations. Some
people in my guild were arranging a new Cazic group and they actually
wanted a paladin there, along with the usual compliment of main
classes, because group healing there is the bomb (due to the way the
mobs behave.) They also have a cleric of course but the paladin is
good to group heal there due to his AC/HP.
