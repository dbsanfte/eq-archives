I appreciate the reply, Gnavpot. I kinda assumed that this was pretty much
the only NG for EQ, since I had done a search on it before I found *this*
one. And I do understand that some people post in an "alternate to English
language" for this reason. I guess what I was wondering was... why? If they
can't actually *write* in English (well enough to be understood, that is),
then will they actually be able to read it, assuming they get any replies?
Or is it merely like fishing the Blackfoot, or the Bitterroot, where you can
cast your line in the water and hope that *some* damn thing bites? (not
trying to be hurtful or offensive here, just trying really hard to
understand the logic!) I'm sorry, everyone, I'm really not stupid, I just
can't help but wondering why, since it isn't something that I could ever
see -myself- do. And I'm gonna let this post die soon, since so no one has
had much of an answer for me but the ones I already had for myself. At
least, *hopefully* it will die ;) )

thanks,
Dark
