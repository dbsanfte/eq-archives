Sure, but you still need to compare cash per hour to cash per
hour.  

I don't care whether I'm in a group getting 15pp and dividing by
5 or soloing and getting 4pp, the question isn't how much do I
get per mob, but rather how much can I pull in per hour?

HG solo, I can pull in about 45pp per hour(assuming I don't die,
a real possibility).  Frosties solo I can maybe pull in 40pp per
hour.. neither of those is going to get me to 9000pp anytime soon
though.  What might work best would be duoing HG, a duo would
make them much safer and probably would yeild a lot more than
twice as many kills per hour (which I'd have to get to compensate
for splitting the cash 50/50)... or perhaps duoing Frosties.

Fighting other people for my share of the HG spawns has yet to be
any trouble, as I pointed out before, because mages are very well
suited to killing the PH mobs while medding back up.  I guess it
would be possible for it to be so crowded that people would be
lining up to steal the mobs I spawn... haven't seen that yet.

But I was hoping for something much more lucrative and more
interesting, since I've done both types of giants before on other
characters.
