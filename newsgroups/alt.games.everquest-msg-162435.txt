I used to do so, but here's the thing; I play several alts, and even when
playing my main, I change spell line up a lot.  I mean,  A LOT.  I try to keep
the bread and butter spells on the same places, but that leaves 4 swap slots
depending on whats going on, and I'm not always consistent as to what goes
where in those slots, they are arranged for positional logic for the situation.

Trouble with this plan is, I'm not absolutely certain whats in slot 1 or 5 or 6
or 7.  So Alt 1 is an iffy proposition, involving me looking at the spell bar
and translating that position to a number... ok, well slot one isn't hard, but
5, 6, and 7 can be more difficult.  Instead of graphic lag, I have to contend
with wetware lag!  By clicking directly on the spell icon, I get visual
confirmation of what I"m about to do, without having to then process which
number key to hit.

As I said, I used to use the alt system religiously, on my first character.  I
got sloppy about this the next time thru, but struggled with it on and off for
ages.  Then the new UI came along, which allowed me to move the spell bar over
next to the party screen, and suddenly my mouse travel time dropped to a
fraction of its former self.  Forcing myself to use alt # keys now would be
nigh impossible!
