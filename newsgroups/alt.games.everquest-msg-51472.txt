I just made level 20 so my experience is fairly limited.  But, I can
snare/DOT/DD/DD/DD/DD even and lower but I run out of mana on yellow and
reds.  I have 125 wis.  For yellow and red (especially crag spiders although
they are no longer red), I snare/dot/root.  Reapply as neccessary.  I always
snare to pull. and DOT before root.  If I don't get any resists I come out
with full mana.  On average I come out with between 3 and 4 bubs of mana.
