I learned to hate Bolts when my Magician was young. (This was shortly after
SoL went live, by the way)

Grouped at Orc 2 in EC, and was using the Bolt spell. Stopped after
whatshisname (that guy in the hut across from the last inn before WC who
runs around near Orc 2 occasionally) stepped right in the path of a Bolt and
I almost died running to zone.

Had a few other problems with Bolts either hitting the wrong target (because
something moved into the path of the spell) or missing the target.

After that, I never used a Bolt spell again until I started hunting HGs in
RM for plat. (I mainly only load up the Bolt spell when in RM in case of
KSers or getting 2 HGs on me at one time. Otherwise, I rely on my buffed up
pet and only cast DS and pet heals)

To me, Bolt spells are useless in dungeons, and I don't like using them on
mobs that are the same size (or smaller) than PCs.
