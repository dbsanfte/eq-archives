My guild is very small, and to get some more cohesiveness, I am going to 
suggest a small raid on Cazic and try to conquer the Avatar of Fear.  I'm 
just looking for a small milestone for a guild that rarely has over 4 
people on at once.

Some friends and I went to take him out once, but we didn't make it when 
the Rogue overpulled at the edge of the water and we lost the cleric fast, 
and it went downhill from there, although we only lost 2 people.  It was 
late, so we called it off.

So, I'm looking for any information that would help us kill this guy.  This 
is about the total sum of my knowledge of the AoF:

1) He's in Cazic, and level 38
2) Has 2 Clerics ( Cenobytes? ) nearby that will heal him if you don't pull 
him far enough away.  Actually, at our level, the clerics will probably 
join in, I think.
3) Harmtouches for about 380
4) Has a lizzie PH
5) Drops either the claws ( which you will see ) or the BP

I will be there with my 34 chanter.  I will be worthless in the battle, but 
will  just be buffing, tashing, runeing, and mezzing anything else that 
is around, I guess.  Also attending will be 2 wizzies, 42 and 41, a Cleric 
who was 38 last night, and probably a mid-30's Druid.  We will need a tank 
of some sort, and I have a few friends that will fit the bill.

I'm looking for any strategies that will help ( rune the tank for the HT, 
have a pet class with us and park it on the spawn point for the HT, etc ) 
us do this.  I imagine this won't seem like much to most, but taking down a 
big mob for a screenshot will be pretty nice for us, and maybe we'll get 
lucky and get something worth keeping from the whole affair.

Any help is appreciated.
