I don't believe the issue is "correctness", whatever that is. It's what's
acceptable in the given social context. I've started referring to street
missions in CoH as "street sweepers", not because it's correct (it's not,
there's no such thing in the game with that name) and not because it's
easier to type. All of these bits of slang and lingo had their origin with
one person somewhere deciding that he was going to call it something
different for whatever reason, maybe it just fits his mental model easier,
and through repetition it gains currency. Someone somewhere decided to start
referring to "LDoN Hard" even though there is no such characterization in
the game (they're actually "High Difficulty").

In CoH, many people say "I need one more bar to level". Last night I
actually heard someone complain that "they are called bubbles, not bars".
LOL, I kid you not. And that's exactly what this debate sounds like to me.
