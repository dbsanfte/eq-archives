Apparently there was a big glitch in all the faction hits in various
zones, plus the monk's FD got totally hosed again on that one. I imagine
they wanted to fix those things to avoid an endless nightmare of demands
for faction adjustments and CS rezzes for monks. Not sure what else got
hosed. Fact is, things were broken and they had to fix them.
