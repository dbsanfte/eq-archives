What mystery? I haven't yet found a recipie in game that wasn't already
listed on EQtraders or in their forums somewhere, more often that not I am
killing in a zone where I haven't been in a while and I start looting all
this crap asking in group or guild what would anyone want that particular
item for. Of course it helps to have a 2nd computer up and running connected
to Alla 24x7, but this is not always the case. They should start weeding
through the crappy items and crappy quests that no hardly does or implement
something as they have described where it makes it easier for people to
figure it out for themselves.
