That's not at all the response I saw.  Many, many liberals were very upset 
with Clinton for bombing Iraq.  It definitely caught everyone off guard, 
but the protesters hit the streets of Berkeley just like clockwork.

}I'd have to agree with you there... Clinton bombed Iraq to avoid being
}impeached, at least that's my opinion.

That was what I thought at first, too.  But when you factor in how long it 
took to set up Clinton's little Iraqi escapades, they had to have been 
arranged well before the whole impeachment deal.  I believe there's also 
record that he did it because his advisors strongly advised it.  But even 
going on the first impression... Nobody was impressed by that, liberal or 
conservative.

I did think the whole impeachment issue was rather pathetic.  But then, I 
thought Clinton was also pathetic.  *Shrug*

}> Yet we, as voters, tolerate said brawl.
}Erm... so (assuming you're a voter) you think "said brawl" is ok because you
}tolerate it?  Maybe we (as voters) should consider voting for the
}non-brawlers.

They have this awful habit of not running for office...

}Problem is that humanity is stupid.  Most people are sheep
}(no offense to those who aren't).  They will follow the most titillating
}candidate, usually.  On the other hand, the system works remarkably well
}despite that, and even though most politicians are bastards, they usually do
}exactly what the people want, since otherwise their career is ended.  It's
}somewhat ironic that the politicians, whose job is based on their ability to
}lead sheep around by their noses, will lose that job unless they let the
}sheep lead them around by the nose once they get the job.

Especially those 15% of the sheep who still have any faith in the system 
left and actually vote.

}> We're two people (three, since Kaev is usually well reasoned) discussing

Well, it -is- possible.  I was thinking more that any sufficiently strong, 
sufficiently supported statement of opinion can have a policing effect.  
People tend to fall in line with it if they can't find a logical flaw.

}> The worst it's gotten is that I'm completely ignoring Taras in this

Now, you did say something very wrong.  I don't think you did so 
intentionally, but I can see where it would upset a reasonable person.  
Now I want you two to come out here and shake hands... :)

}> Well, capitalism checked by the government keeps three interests in play.

}The only thing that can be said about capitalism is it's the lesser of
}several evils.  There is no other economic system (as far as I can tell)
}that works as well.  Also, I like the fact that capitalism involves less
}interference by the government than other systems.  But you can't seriously
}argue that capitalism is a perfect, or even exemplary, system.

Sure he can.  Being wrong has never stopped someone from arguing a point 
seriously. :) I think the 'lesser of several evils' bit needs work.  None 
of the economic systems out there are inherently just good or evil... 
they're all a gamish of both.  Capitalism has a higher ratio of good bits 
to bad bits, definitely, but it's a long way from perfection.

I think the ones you're objecting to are a subset of liberals, which are 
in turn a subset of left-wingers.  But maybe not.  I'll agree it's fair, 
maybe, once we finally get around to defining those terms. :)

}You know, I don't want to criticize or anything, but I don't understand how
}so many people can say "I'm a Republican" or "Democrat" or "right-winger" or
}"left-winger".  I would hate to think my beliefs are defined by the group
}whose beliefs I hold.  I simply believe what makes sense to me.  I think I
}could be labeled according to my position in a political group but... the
}problem I see here is that the "conservatives" end up taking blame for and
}defending the actions of other "conservatives" and "liberals" end up taking
}blame for and defending the actions of other "liberals".

Naw, the liberals end up taking the blame for Democrats, even though there 
are so few liberal Democrats left. :) But yes, what you describe is an 
unfortunate side effect of the fact that in order to accomplish anything 
meaningful politically in the government of a population the size of the 
US, you pretty much have to be playing as part of a team.

}I much prefer to
}have my own beliefs and taking consequences for my beliefs and actions only.
}For example, I don't like Clinton or Bush (though I think both did some good
}things).  I've seen people's eyes bug out when I say that -- "But which side
}are you on?!"  Erm... I'm not on either side.  If a politician does
}something I like, I respect that.  If the same person does something I
}disagree with, under no circumstances do I feel obliged to defend them.
}But... to each his own, I guess.

Yup, I'm right there with you.  If God wanted us to vote, he would have 
given us candidates. :)
