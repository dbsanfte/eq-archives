Well my WE Warr has never gotten a SoW request :) Maybe its the Plate Armor,
and Dually Wielded Wurmy and Centi Longsword that has somthing to do with
that :)

Also, with a bit ( well lavish amount ) of twinking, the starting stats of
a Wood Elf can be overcome. With the proper items equipped Kyrdra has a 140
Stamina, and a 209 Strength :) HP's run right around 1850 with my wifes
Clerics buffs :)

Ths whole idea of a little wispy wood elf being a big bad warrior was jsut
TOO Good of a paradox for me to pass up making one. Im glad I did now, as
Kyrdra is simplay a BLAST to play : )
