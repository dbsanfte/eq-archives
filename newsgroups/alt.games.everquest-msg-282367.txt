I know, I know, its off topic.  Didn' you see where it says (OT)?  SO 
just put the thread on ignore if you aren't interested in this, as the 
EQ connection in it is faint indeed.

But anyway, I know there's someone on this forum who's repeatedly 
insisted that he'll only play games where lizardmen are a playable race.

Well I've been fooling around with Neverwinter Nights again recently, 
and managed to get the PRC running; thats a hak which adds something on 
the order of 25 new races and 25 new Prestige classes and a handfull of 
new base classes to the game.  Its not highly convenient, and of course 
most modules aren't designed with it in mind, so NPC's usually won't 
react properly to the inherant wrongness of wandering around as, say, an 
Illithid... but its there.

And more to the point, one of the playable races is:
========================================================================

Lizardfolk are reptilian humanoids, primitive by modern standards but 
rumored to be relatives of the creator races. Lizardfolk are tall and 
muscular, and prefer frontal assaults in combat. Organized tribes, 
however, are able to use traps and ambushes to compensate for a lack of 
numbers. Survival is the primary concern in lizardfolk society and will 
engage in a number of activities, such as allying with other races or 
pledging servitude to dragons, to ensure this. Lizardfolk can speak 
draconian and can become competent druids, although their size makes 
them ideal fighters.

Lizardfolk Ability Adjustments: +2 Str, +2 Con, -2 Int
Favored Class (Druid): A multiclass lizardfolk's druid class does not 
count when determining whether he suffers an XP penalty for multiclassing.

Special Abilities:

- Weapon Proficiency (Simple): All Lizardfolk are proficient with Simple 
Weapons.
- Weapon Proficiency (Creature): Lizardfolk can make an unarmed attack 
with their claws.
- Shield: All Lizardfolk are proficient with shields.
- Skill Affinity (Jump): +4 racial bonus to Jump checks.
- Natural Armor Bonus: Racial natural armor bonus of 5.
- Darkvision: Lizardfolk are able to see in the dark.
- Reptilian: Lizardfolk count as Reptilian for the purpose of spells.
