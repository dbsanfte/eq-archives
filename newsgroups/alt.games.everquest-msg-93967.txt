One of my guildies moved one of his alts to Legends.  He says that most of
the players are Ebayers who don't know how to play ie: he had to tell a 60
chanter how his aoe mezz worked.  Most of the time, it's so boring he comes
back to the regular server to buff me and others and give rezzes for the
guild.  He did have one good experience, said there was a war on Akanon, he
told of hiding in some pool and then ambushing a mag and dotting him till he
died.  All in all some good and some bad things on Stormhammer.  I'm not too
impressed, I won't spend $40 a month on it.
