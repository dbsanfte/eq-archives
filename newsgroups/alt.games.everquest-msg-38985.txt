Play an Iksar, who starts out with 102 swimming.  I had 
the HARDEST time getting up the damn ladder the first 
time I dove into the water, because I was going too fast 
*g* If you don't hit that ladder right on, it seems to 
give you a 'push' and you end up about halfway across 
the moat.

It definitely is.  Swimming with my lower level 
characters I'm very careful to keep my head above water 
most of the time, but with my shaman and mage I've found 
the quietest place to practice is often at, say, the 
bottom of the lake in Felwithe :)  (Sure, my shaman 
doesn't *need* to worry about holding her breath 
anymore...)
