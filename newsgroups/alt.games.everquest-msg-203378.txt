I can't get KEI for my rogue anymore.  Gotta wait 4 more levels...







It's an odd thing, but I've paid more for KEI for my tradeskillers
than I ever have for my hunters.  My necro's always ignored KEI (same
for my shaman), my druid only ever went after it once for hunting (3
times for tradeskills), and the only times I've ever gotten it for my
Paladin was for tradeskills, never for hunting.  I've had it cast on
me a few times during raids, but I don't count those because it wasn't
me going looking for it.
