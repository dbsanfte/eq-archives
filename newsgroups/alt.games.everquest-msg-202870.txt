Perhaps they changed the way xp is awarded at a more basic level, i.e.  
each player gets an equal share now, regardless of level.  Otherwise, 
they could do it, by tracking who the last player to join was, and just 
not including that player in the calculation of the xp division.  My 
guess would be they bumped the group bonus, and it will affect the xp of 
the others, but not by a huge amount.
