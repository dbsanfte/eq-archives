I doubt it.

The downside of your monk is he can neither sow nor port nor cast
enduring breath nor lev nor camo.  He can't Gate, he doesn't have Bind
Affinity, he can't Harmony or Snare.  Shall I go on?  That you have
learned to live with these inconveniences doesn't mean they don't
exist.

The enchanter's disadvantages are fewer, but still significant;
primary among them being again the inability to sow or port.  He
doesn't solo very well (pre-60 and tons of AA points).

Sure, some of these can be overcome at high level but the game isn't
just about level 60.

No.  I turned my back on the class because, although it seemed
balanced, I perceived it wasn't for me.  I loathe soloing, I find it
incredibly boring.  I like going on raids and being in groups.  So I
chose a more group-oriented class.

It isn't that a druid is useless in a group or on raids, just that
aside from evac they rarely get a chance to *shine*, to make everyone
thank God they were along.

Spare me the elitist garbage.  Your class envy is painful to observe.
Tell me what a druid does other than quadding which is even remotely
difficult?  Then play a cleric in an overpull situation where aggro is
all over the place and it isn't just a case of CHealing the MA every
30 seconds.

To call cleric the easist class is, frankly, ignorant.
