From the shadows, the mysterious "Richard Lawson" <nouma@msn.com> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

I think it went down like this: EQ in beta, the developers aren't
thinking in terms of camps. They make spawn times around twenty to
thirty minutes in places like SolB and LG, figuring that was enough
time to kill the monsters, rest up, and move on to the next one
safely.

The thought that they might stay where they are and kill the same
monsters over and over again surprised them. "Don't they find that
boring?" they ask themselves.

Well, apparently not! So one individual, who either severely disliked
the idea of people sitting and waiting for things to spawn and wanted
to dissuade them from doing it, or was so sick and twisted he just
wanted to see how far he could get people to go, decided to make
encounters with longer and longer camping times.

Voila! Ragefire camp! And this perverse individual finds that the
average dedicated EQ player (or cleric, at least), is SO hooked he is
willing to camp a mob for literally days and days, constantly, in
person (because if you didn't, you lost your spot) to get an item that
casts a spell he already has!

At this point this person threw up his hands. No matter what he did,
someone would find it worthy of camping. And so, they embraced it.


Maybe. :-)
