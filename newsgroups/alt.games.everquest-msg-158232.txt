I doubt they would remove them if this was a problem.  What they would do is
put a time limit on trader mode, and and idle time limit, so after a set
time, you drop out of trader mode, and then a while after that, you log out.

The only real problem I can see them having is bandwidth consumption.  A
better (from the player point of view) solution to that would be to make
traders not take up significant bandwidth.  When you enter trader mode, it
should stop sending updates to you, except when someone is browsing your
wares.  That would cut almost all bandwidth caused by AFK traders.
