I agree, if buying a new soundcard instead of paying for another version 
of Windows is more value for money then definitely. Although personally 
I would never pay full price for a version of Windows for use at home. I 
  don't believe the product quality is worth the price.

It depends how much you are comfortable with installing Windows. I 
usually do a reinstall every 6 months on average anyway, and I know 
quite a few people who do the same.
