I can confirm that, by the way, just to be sure, I slapped DB on while on
my way to the bazaar (I knew it would be back up before I'd need it) and
tried to arbitrate, game would not let me.

Now I need another cleric or a paladin with DA and enough "safe time" to
spare that they can afford to put invulnerability up for a test, to see if
DArb will penetrate it.
