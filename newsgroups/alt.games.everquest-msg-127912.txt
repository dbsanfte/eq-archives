I don't think Verant would ever bless something.. they'd take the trouble of
shutting you down if you were in violation but I think it would be risky for
them to specifically authorize anything because then if it did turn out to
be an
exploit or do something bad it would look bad on them..

I would like to add to MapX the ability to annotate maps - perhaps by using
the /note command to write a line into the log file (hey that's how I
annotate
manually, might as well have MapX support it).

Other thing I'd like to do is split MapX into three parts:  The client, a
"data
uploader", and a server.  A guild could set up the server, and the uploader
would take the location data from the log file and send it to the server.
Then
MapX would ask the server where the players were rather than looking through
the log files itself.

This would make MapX more useful when playing with a friend who isn't at
your
house..
