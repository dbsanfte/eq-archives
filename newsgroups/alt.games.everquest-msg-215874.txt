My 53rd at the time enchanter had no problems, the 49 pet could handle a
dozen mobs at once.

It will take a while. Took me... about 9 hours to get all 4 items. Funny
thing, when I took my mage in there a few weeks ago with my friend, (I got
back in to give him a leg up, as it were), we dropped a stein, torch, and
broom in about 4 hours.

Might be faster to make 1kpp to buy them by going somewhere and quad kiting
if they are common in your bazaar.

Alternatively, they drop off the gators (or crocodiles, I forget) right
outside Lost Temple of Cazic Thule. Obviously there are advantages to that
for you, since it is outdoors.

afaik there are two really dangerous mobs in Najena. I forget what one of
them is, the other is part of the magician's epic, and chased the 48 ranja
(trust me he was a ranja) that came in about halfway through our evening out
of the zone. Didn't seem to be agro though (never agro'd on shaman/gnome
combo).
