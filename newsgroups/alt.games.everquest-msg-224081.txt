#1. They let in ladies too.

#2. You Must Buy a new account key. You may be able to acquire an 
account from someone departing, but that's usually more $$.

#3. You do get 30 days free with the new account.

#4. Once you are hooked on EQ, you will save money instead of buying any 
other game.

#5. If you can't afford EQ, you really should go get a job, and 
shouldn't waste the time on the game anyway.
