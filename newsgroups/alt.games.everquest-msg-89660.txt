   Yeah, that is an eyebrow raiser alright.  I have a gut 
feeling that alot less than 10% of the user base even 
bothers to come onto usenet at all.  In fact, if /ooc
and /shout conversation is any indication at all, it
would seem to me that a sizable percentage of the EQ
demographic isn't aware that one can use the internet
to research such puzzlers as "How do I smith?" or
"Where is the bank?"
   
Annie  <--- likes to /ooc "It's near the Jade!", then zone.
