Sounds like fun.  Used to play on test but my system was getting 
crowded, so I had to take out my extra EQ directory.  Got a new HD so 
now I have room.

How about monday nights? Tuesdays are always crazy around here.  Never 
get to play when I want.  What hours/time zone, so I can tell my hubby 
to leave me the hell alone about playing?

I'll make another Bebinn unless I've used that on test already.
