Aye, I left out the smiley. :)

Yep, you'll get no argument there. :)

}Well, my argument has nothing to do with whether any particular

}and/or universal evil,

All right, so describe to me what use a hypothetical universal good or 
evil can be if it has nothing to do with what individuals think... In 
order, in my mind, for it to -matter- whether there is one, it has to 
impinge on this universe in some way.  We have to have a way of perceiving 
even the smallest part of it.  If this were the case, I would expect it to 
have some impact on what individuals, or individual societies, think.

}so your argument unravels at its source.

I'm a frayed knot.
