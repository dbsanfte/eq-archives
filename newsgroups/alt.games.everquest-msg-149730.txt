Of course I often have to heal multiple group members. Duh. I'm just
saying that I think it is best if that scenario is avoided whenever
possible.

In your example the caster should also be refreshing root before it
breaks. Also, they have to be pretty banged up before they get a heal
in most cases. Don't get me wrong. I don't let them die by any means.
Casters should just be staying out of melee enough that they can just
heal while medding.

Uh, ok, but it doesn't have to be that way in an efficient group.
Maybe you just need to group with better players. (Yeah, that last
crack may have ruffled my feathers a bit. It was quite presumptuous on
your part and didn't exactly do anything to foster productive
conversation here.)

DAoC? *hock, ptooey* This is EQ and luckily I don't normally have to
worry about crowd control. Bad comparison.
