  Yep, I was forced to purchase RIMM for my Sony VAIO desktop.  Found
  a great deal at CompCity.  $99 per 256Meg stick.  Not too bad.
  Best deal I could find.  Here's the address:

  CompCity Computer Corp.
  6755 Mira Mesa Blvd., Ste. 114
  San Diego, CA 92121
  (858) 622-1900 Tel
  (858) 622-1902 Fax

  I'm not affiliated with them...just passing on the info :)
