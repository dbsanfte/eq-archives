You missed one.

4. Dupes, bugs and Verant idiocy.

On any old server (and by old, I mean older than 1-month), the majority of
the money in circulation came from Verant idiocy.  The ability to dupe cash,
the ability to do something that creates cash from thin air, the ability to
spend 7 copper making a pie tin and sell it for 35 platinum to a vendor at a
pottery skill of 1 and never fail the combine with all the supplies
conveniently on a vendor next to a pottery wheel, the ability to buy an
item from a vendor and walk three steps to another vendor who will buy it
back for more, etc., etc., etc., *this* is where the *real* money comes
from.
