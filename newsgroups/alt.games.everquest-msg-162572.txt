Why would you not want an Ikky necro in your group?  Out of curiosity.
I've actually never grouped with one - when I think about it, the
majority of grouping necros I see are gnomes. :)

Focus items, focus items, focus items.

What I had when I was young:
spell haste - woven grass bracelet.
mana preservation - polished bone hoop.
Extended affliction - hollowed bone bracers.
Affliction efficiency - polished bone bracelet.
Extended range - moonstone ring.
Regeant conservation - batskull earring/savant's cap.
reanimation efficiency - flowing black robe.
reanimation haste - nightshade wreath.
summoning efficiency - dusty bloodstained gloves.

Some effects I skilled or haven't yet gotten my hands on.  IE, I
passed on any dealing with buffs because I rarely bother buffing
myself, and I passed on healing items because I don't group often
enough (without someone who can heal a hundred times more efficiently
than I can) to warrant it.

Spell haste is good, because all our spells seem to take foerver to
cast ;p - I got the grass bracelet for 10pp in the bazaar by a stroke
of luck - I'd wait until I saw it under 100.

Mana preservation, because the less you spend, the less you have to
suck back by giving up HP - I find PBHs on the vendors in EK every so
often.  In the bazaar, they're a bit more pricey.

Anything to do with affliction, because it makes our DOTs better.  The
HBB came from a raid, can be found for under 100 in the bazaar.  The
PBH, again, I've found several on vendors in EK.

Extended range is fantastic, I find that when I cast snare as a
puller, it gives me time to get an extra spell off before they get to
me.

Regeant conservation, meh.  They're bone chips, you can pick em up for
a couple silver each on a vendor if you're too lazy to farm them, and
it's VERY easy to farm bone chips using a pet and 'sense the dead' in
any newb area.  BUT the savant's cap does have decent stats on it for
a low level necro, and can be found super cheap, so if you want one,
go ahead and pick it up.

Reanimation efficiency was okay, but I found I preferred the stats of
the Advisor robe with no effect rather than saving a bit of mana on a
pet cast.  Now that I'm getting up there in levels, I'll be trying
again.

Reanimation haste is nice if you have the cash to spend on it, but not
hugely necessary.  If you happen to find a good deal on a nightshade
wreath (150 or less), which again has decent stats, go for it,
otherwise, pass it up.

The summoning efficiency I got by fluke, as I happened to see some of
the gloves for cheap in the bazaar and grabbed them for the mana.

items you should be looking for:

This, I must disagree with.  I have an int of over 200 at level 33,
and still go for int gear above all.  But then, I fear kite a LOT, or
duo with a druid who roots them - if root breaks and it jumps him, I
slap it with screaming terror so he can reroot, if it jumps me, he
just reroots.  Right now I'm fear kiting the gnolls, aviaks, and
centaurs of SK, and this is basically how it goes with my level 29
spells: summon pet, cast allure of death, pull with snare dot.  Sick
pet.  Fear, DoT, DoT, DoT, sit and med while pet smacks it.  When fear
breaks the dots have usually done enough damage to make it VERY pissed
off at me, so I stand and recast fear immediately, sit and let pet
whack away again until it's dead.  If it resists fear, I've got both
screaming terror and FD to remove aggro with until I can move far
enough away to try fearing again.  If neither of those work, well, I
can take a couple of hits without much damage to the hp bar - after
that, the extra 20 hp on any item I might be able to get is going to
last one hit.

Note that this might change when I get my level 34 spells.  I've heard
rumors that CoB is a drastically larger drain on HP than any of the
spells before it, *and* casters realm discusses a bug where, if you
click off CoB but remain a skeleton, it means the spell is still in
effect and you have to cast cancel magic on yourself to remove the
effect (if anybody can confirm or deny that, I'll be a happier necro).
But at low levels, I've not yet had the problem where I got
dangerously low on health, let alone died, to mana recovery spells.

Well, except the one time I accepted a duel and we both forgot about
the dot rule and dotted the hell out of each other "down to one
bubble" as per agreement, sat down to recover, and both promptly died.
;p  And I would have died of his dots if I allure of death hadn't
chosen the right moment to suck another 4 hp away.

Ryou
(still wonders if the zone-wide message read "Nova and Maelek have
managed to *both* lose a duel to the death!")
