I don't think you need to start over.  Using up all your mana while soloing
is normal.  You should try grouping.  Or not.  You could get more int items,
but it will not prevent you running out of mana really.  If you do decide to
start over you can either give all your stuff to someone you trust or you
could do a double pass.  Create a dummy character and camp him somewhere no
one is likely to happen by and pick up your stuff.  Bring your L13 char to
the spot and camp.  While the 30 seconds is timing down drop all your stuff
on the ground (I hope you picked a safe spot).  Log back in with the mule
and pick it up.  Then create the new character and repeat the process.
Remember though that new characters corpses evaporate quickly so if you have
anything you don't want to lose maybe you should gain a few levels before
you twink.  Or at least remember not to die anywhere you cant get back to
quickly.
