Yes thats my point. After velious and Kunark I remember having a fairly
large patch for both. After that I don't remember anything needing to be

Even if I did I would guess it would be relatively small.

Not everyone has a CD Burner btw, I just recently got one with my new
computer yet had been playing EverQuest for a time with my older one.
