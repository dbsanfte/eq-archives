Why the hell not? This is a forum to discuss and debate stuff. Feel

Well, keep in mind, I'm not suggesting that our young adventurer go
master tailoring and try to make stuff to sell. I'm simply suggesting
the gathering of PITA materials to sell *TO* tailors as a way to get
money. The options of combining some of them ahead of time if he/she has
a high enough skill are simply that: options.

I havent't been in the newbie zones around there hunting in ages, but
aren't there spiders and fur bearing critters in BB? I mean, it's only
one zone away. And if not, it's a short boat ride to Freeport. The
surrounding newbie zones there are rich in furs and silks.

Well, then your luck is bad or Drinal sucks. I know on Xev people are
constantly /auctioning in Gfey for materials. And if I see them being
offered, I snap them up. Wish you were on my server. You'd have saved me
many nights of camping green cats. *sigh*.

You were ripped off beyond the worst possible level I could imagine.
Making a skinning knife takes a blacksmithing skill of, what? 30 to
trivial? You can almost get that from the trainer. And a couple plat in
materials tops. The smith that charged you that should be taken out
behind the Fungus Grove outpost and shot.

Yes, HQ bear pelts are another good suggestion for the OP, but
*everyone* always suggests that. I was trying to offer him some other
possible sources of revenue.

Not that Everfrost is bad... it's great. But it's a long trip for a cash
strapped level 9. The same advice could be taken in the greater Freeport
area if there are no silk/fur sources near GFey and BB.
