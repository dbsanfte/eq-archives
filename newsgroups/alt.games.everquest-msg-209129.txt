Welcome to the wide world of wizarding.  I hope you enjoy the trip!

The range of a fire bolt, in combination with a focus item that increases
spell range, used to be enough that mobs would no longer aggro.  Sony fixed
that some time ago; it's no longer valid.  To paraphrase, if you hit it, it
will come.

Root - N - Nuke is the standard method of the soloing wizard until level 29,
when you get your first snare-analog spell, Bonds of Force.  The problem is
that any direct damage, whether from melee or from a nuke, has a chance of
breaking root.  Wizard nukes are so reknowned for this that it's expected -
I was on a raid the other day, and when an add stayed rooted, it was said
/rsay "Some wizard nuke that and break root."  One Draught of Ic'i later,
root broke.  /bow

The easiest way for you to work with this is to do your best to pick
slow-moving mobs, and kill them from extreme range.  This is where your bolt
is used best.  Root your target, back away until you can just hit it, then
bolt away.  Watch for the text message that your root broke.  When root
goes - it's when, not if - click your root spellgem and keep clicking until
the mob is in range for it to cast.  If the mob runs slowly enough and the
range is long enough, you can re-root before the mob gets to you.  Back to
extreme range, and repeat.  If the mob does catch you - you get practice in
channeling off a root.  :)

Once you hit 29 and get your snare spell, you'll be done rooting XP mobs
except as crowd control.

Druid kiting and wizard kiting are two different animals.  Druid kiting is
almost languid, as you snare the mob, back away, drop a dot, back away
again, drop another dot, back up, medd while the mob catches up, back up
more...  this is because druid snares last a very long time, and druid dots
do their damage over a good bit of time.

Wizard kiting, which doesn't start until 29, is fast-paced.  Wizard snare
lasts a very short time - rather like your first druid snare - but wizard
spells do huge damage fast.  Thus, wizard kiting is snare mob - blast -
run - blast - run - blast - get XP, loot mob, sit and med.  A thirty-second
kite is a long one for a wizard, a minute is very long, if it's much over a
minute you'll need to re-snare.
