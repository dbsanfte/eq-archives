>(snare-dotting at 34 is just too painful).

Rot at 34.  Avoid red cons unless you have plenty of mana as root
won't stick or hold well and you won't getmuch med time during the
fight.  Have, at minimum, Mana Preservation 2 and Extended Afliction
2 for focus effects.  Use your swarm DoTs exclusively, probably just
Drones of Doom and Creeping Crud at that, for high mana efficiency,
use Ensnare rather than Snare, _especially_ on red and yellow cons
because you don't want to have to restick Snare.  Use wolfform, it
is faster than SoW and that bit of speed may save your life after
a lag hit and a stun close together threaten to end it.  Always
prefer the blue and even con HGs, all HGs hit hard so the ones that
root sticks to easier are better targets.  Use Grasping Roots (the
cheap L5 one) because your longer lasting roots will just end up
costing more mana when they keep breaking early (yellow and red
con giants will break your roots frequently).  At 38 rotting HGs is
trivial, you can't die unless you are both inattentive and stupid.
