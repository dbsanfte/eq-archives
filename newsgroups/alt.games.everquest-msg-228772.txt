I've never heard it as "things went south", nor does it seem to make a 
whole lot of sense to me that way.

Things went south, I also have no strictly logical (nor for that matter 
theological) basis for, I've heard the expression used and never 
particularly examined its history, just picked up its meaning in context.

Pressed, I'd say that "south" is used because if you arrange a map 
normally on a wall, with north up, south is downhill, and that the 
expression is a more colorful way of saying "things went downhill from 
there".

West?  I'd guess... towards sunset?  Dunno, doesn't seem to me that west 
has a particularly negative connotation.  Going West historically means 
headed for wilderness or for adventure or for gold, to seek one's 
fortune.  None of the above mean to me what I mean by "headed south", 
which indicates a steady inexorable decline, nothing hopeful about it.

The downhill thing, on the other hand, has a Sissyphus sort of thing 
going for it.

Splendid One.  Headed north by northwest
