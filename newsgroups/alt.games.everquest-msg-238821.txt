Cleric alone:
Having a cleric without something to heal seems like it would be a waste,
which would be the situation if you paired a cleric and a wizard.  A mage's
pet would give the cleric something to buff and heal for toe-to-toe combat,
and a cleric/mage combo would be powerful - to a point.  With how hard stuff
starts hitting in PoP, there comes a point where even a cleric keeping the
pet alive is going to be more trouble than it's worth.  I would say this
cutoff is in Plane of Valor, although I haven't specifically tried a
mage/cleric combo there.

Chanter alone:
Assuming the chanter will be charming, I would pick wizard because the
wizard can snare both a mob for the chanter to charm and mob to be attacked,
making charm breaks easier to deal with.  Of course, a druid has a single
target snare and has SoE at high levels to give a little more room for
error, so I would probably go with druid over either wizard or mage.
