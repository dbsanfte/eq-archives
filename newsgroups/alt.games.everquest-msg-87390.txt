Just wait til you work on smithing, chills does not begin to describe it.
The one good thing about smithing, is it is possible to get it up to high
levels without depending on any drops at all.  I originally learned it so I
could make myself, and my twinks banded armor.  Then, later on I realized
that I still had some armor slots without wisdom, so I had to get my
smithing up to max banded, not too expensive to do, so I could work on
imbued northman ringmail to fill the 3 or 4 slots I had no wisdom on.  The
armor itself is not so hot, but the feeling of satisfaction of having made
it myself helps a lot.

I really want some of the high level tailored armor, but, I don't hold out
much hope of getting my tailoring up high enough before I manage to get
ahold of better stuff.
