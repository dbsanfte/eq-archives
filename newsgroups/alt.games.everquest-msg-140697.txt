For most of my characters, I typically spend what cash I have on gear
to get the important stats up.

Recently, I found my 29 wizard wearing mostly cloth armor, but
hoarding a stockpile of 2k in the bank.  I wanted to do something
different with investing the cash, but wasn't sure what.  I came up
with three choices:

(1) Spend on gear to get int + mana

(2) Spend on utility items over time to further my level - for the
wizard, this meant sow potions and KEI.

(3) Bury the money in Kerra Isle (where I'm sure nobody would ever
stumble across it) and save for later.

After some deliberation, I decided to spend it on the utility items. 
It has been a blast so far (literally).  It is fast paced nuking
action, with the levels flying by in little time.  And the lack of
gear has not been a problem, as of yet.  However, once my cash
dwindles down, I will find myself still in cloth armor, broke,
KEI-less, but much further along in level.

How would you rather invest the cash?  Gear or utility items?  Perhaps
there is another choice?  Would you rather advance a few levels and
end up with great gear, or advance many more levels naked?  This
probably does not apply at the high end of the game, but I haven't
made it that far to realize it.

I wonder how things are going to be when the cash does run out and I'm
facing some nasty beasts in cloth.  I'll be the one in the Vox safe
hall asking if anyone has a blanket to help keep me warm =)
