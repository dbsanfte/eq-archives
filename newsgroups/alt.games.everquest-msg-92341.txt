Stevie,

I have a PIII 850 with 640MB or Ram. I've been running a G2 Pro for quite
some time now and have no probs with the graphics. I'm running also at
1024*768 with max clip and have rarely seen any lag.

If you're upgrading on a budget i would say a G3 Ti , if you want to go all
out get a G4 Ti 4600, they're around $400 give or take, i have one on the
way .. should be here Monday !! :)
