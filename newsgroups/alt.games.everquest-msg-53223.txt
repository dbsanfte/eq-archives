OK, and how in the hell do you know that Verant is having router
issues?  I'm certainly not seeing anything out of the ordinary.  Of
course there are probably between 15 and 20 routers between you and
Verant, and at least 2 of them are going to be peering interfaces, not
to mention all the layer two stuff that you can't see, yet you are
sure that the problem is with Verant.
