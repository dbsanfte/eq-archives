Modules have a place in 10 year business plans. Not in games.

/extreme example incoming
Buy our game today and be an artisan class.
Oh sorry you can only create a character for the first 3 months.
Our game is modular.
Oh yes you want to move in the game and not just take screen shots.
You must wait a month
Our game is modular.
Oh and yes you can be an artisan but no quests for you for a year.
Our game is modular.
Oh and yes we have a great economic design for buyers and sellers.
Sorry doors not implemented until 2008
Our game is modular.
/extreme example complete

I buy games and expect them to work as advertised.
If they advertise it.
Its a CORE not an expansion.
Sounds like the game is being pushed to early. Perhaps to the fastest death
ever.
I have played games that aren't even in beta yet that sound more finished
than EQ2

Now I am debating whether to preorder or not to preorder..
With barely a the recommended specs doesn't sound worth it.
