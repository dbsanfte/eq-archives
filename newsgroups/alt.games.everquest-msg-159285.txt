They still happen on AB, you often see people selling stuff and tacking
Will Trade on the end.

OTOH I also think its less common. THe BAzaar where you stand and sell in
plat is the easiest way to shift kit, and to be honest the buyers come in
with pots of plat ready to buy and upgrade. Also with kit now readily
available for any class the benefit of doing a quest and swapping with
another player is really lost when they can nip to an auction zone and buy
buy buy...plus the defined 'value' of an item means trading is a little
lost as people will want an equal trade as its now easy to leg it to the
bazaar and buy at market rate. Gone are the days when you could farm an
area, cross the world to the other end and sell based on rarity, distance
to source or availability and need for most kit.
