I was looking at what appeared to be a "0" on the left side of the
data trasnfer (upper left corner of the screen) all of last nigt's
playing time (5:30-7:30 p.m. EST).  The right side was fluctuating
wildly.  The lag was terrible, but the travel went on. Combat was
almost impossible - was always too far away (lag). Finally gave up.

This morning at 6:20 EST the "servers are congested"  (down
completely).

Anyone else seeing same stuff last night and this a.m.???
