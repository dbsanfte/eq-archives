If you cant respond without being a smarmouthed wise ass, why don't you keep
your stupid mouth shut asshole?

I have the best broadband connection money can buy and LD is gonna happen.
VI should be able to tell that you died after you went LD and at least the
GM's can do is respond to the petition.  If VI wants to have a policy that
LD death is just too bad move on, then they should announce this is the
policy and tell people not to bother the preciouse GM's.  Hey, I know they
are volunteers, but that is so VI can improve their gross magine.  There are
420,000 of us paying $12.95 a month - knucklehead - VI could afford paid
help.  Heck, I would pay more for better GM responce times.
