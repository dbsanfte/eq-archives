After further thought...

I believe that allowing character transfers, in general, is a good
thing.

The only qualm I come up with over the general idea is that someone
might move to escape a bad reputation. I think this concern is
out-weighed, though, by the potential value to those who want to move
for 'valid' reasons, such as to be on a server with their friends.

I think not allowing coin or items to be transferred with the
character is just plain goofy. They are imposing the limit of no moves
to servers younger than 3 months - that should take care of item and
cash disparities just fine. Let's not pretend that the economy is
going to be wrecked if someone with a loaded inventory suddenly
appears on a three month old server. Or even hundreds of such
someones.

I think the price is absolutely absurd. It looks calculated
specifically to discourage all but a few die-hards from moving. I'm
going to guess that the price reflects a labor-intensive operation,
but that just begs this question in my mind - do you want some
individual doing $50 *minimum* of manual labor on the character that
you've spent time building up, and are you willing to take the risk
that they'll screw up in the process?

I recently argued here with someone over "excessive profits". If that
person were to wave that phrase in my face right now, I'd have trouble
bringing myself to argue with him!


The way *I* would have liked to have seen this handled is for Verant
to have written a web-based (or chat server-based) program that would
allow individuals to initiate the move(s) themselves, and which would
have immediately billed a credit card some reasonable amount - say
$10. Once the billing was verified, the *complete* character record
would be moved, including items, coins, and faction.

Yeah, the initial program would probably be a real bugbear to write.
But once it was in place, Verant would have a hands-off method to
generate more income for themselves, and at the same time would add
real value for the user base.
