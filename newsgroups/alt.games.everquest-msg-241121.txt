 Same exact thing happened to me yesterday in the exact same location. After
falling for a good 5 minutes and not getting anywhere I ported back to
Surefall.
Just chaulked it up to EQ's patching again. The insane lag in PoK was more
of a problem for me than falling through the world. I could hardly move at
all yesterday. =-/
