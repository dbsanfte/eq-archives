So far, some (all?) dogs and archers seem to see invis, as well as any
named that are around. It does tend to make things a bit exciting <g>.
I wonder how the PoP/LDoN generation is gonna handle having to deal
with serious corpse runs. Not sure whether I like it or not, they can
be fun sometimes but doing a 2 hour CR deep within a zone isn't fun
after the first few times you have to do it.
