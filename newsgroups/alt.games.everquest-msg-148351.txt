I played DAoC for about 3 months after giving EQ a break.
After an initial fascination, I did not find it all that entertaining.
I was nowhere near "Evercrack". The graphics were not as good, the
spells and classes not as interesting. I sort of liked the RvR style
PvP, but soon got tired of getting killed by a single arrow from a
high ranked opponent (where i did not even know i was in "battle" till
i was dead.
Also, group PvP is not all that great. Here is one reason why:
In EQ (or DAoC) when you are fighting mobs, it is fairly easy to keep
the mob on the tank. In PvP group fighting, (which is a big part of
DAoC) the teams know to go for the cleric and the casters first.

All in all, I was disapointed. I was all in favor of DAoC for a while,
but it did not hold an attraction for me like EQ did/does.
