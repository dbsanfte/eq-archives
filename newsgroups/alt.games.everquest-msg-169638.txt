One thing I don't understand is why the big deal about taunting a mezed
mob anymore.  Just root it and start killing (one taunt doesn't hurt
though).  I've tried to explain this to  groups I've been in, but no one
pays any attention.  I can do this fairly quick, and it almost always
works, at least as much as just taunting a couple times, and takes less
time than taunting 2ce.  Of course this works even better if you've got
a pally or some other who can root it instead of the enchanter.
