Well, except, like I have said, I'm playing in HHK.  They *start* 
against a wall.  And since everybody insists on sitting in a different 
corner, the next mob to pop aggros on the first thing it sees, that 
first thing pops up and starts hitting it or hitting their "GET IT OFF 
GET IT OFF" hotbutton, and there I am standing behind three tanks (who 
are ALWAYS Vah Shir/ogres/barbarians, dammit!  I'm going to BAN large 
tanks without shrink potions...) going "BACK UP RIGHT NOW.  BACK. THE. 
HELL. UP."

At which point three back up, and the fourth stands there continuing to 
wack at it until it dies in the wall and we all lose exp.
