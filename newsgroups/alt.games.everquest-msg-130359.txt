No no no.  My *other* character that I've run through Qey with was a 
human SK, and had to be careful where she ran.  The one I wanted bound 
this time was a DE rogue, and since DEs aren't necessarily the most 
beloved race in the game (it's because I'm beautiful, I know it)... and 
sneak/hide is difficult to use in a city where I can't seem to find 
*one* place where there aren't wanderers.  I went into a hotel in S Qey 
once with the human SK intending to camp in a quiet room where nobody 
would wander.  BAM.  I was flattened by two I-have-no-idea-whats hiding 
in the back who seemed to take offense to my choice of lifestyles.  In 
short... I hate Qey's politics more than I hate Freeport's. :)
