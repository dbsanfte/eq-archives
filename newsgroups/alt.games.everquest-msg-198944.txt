I agree that those were moron donations and you have every right to put them
on a do not donate list (or simply /ignore).  But I think you are making a
mistake in how you look at the situation in general.  A couple bad tippers
should not be enough to make you give up on the donations gambit.  Rather
you should judge your donations by what you pull in total per hour.  If the
good tippers make up for the bad tippers then all is good.  Or likewise, if
you make enough more per hour by advertising 50p period to make up for the
harrassement you will take, then go for it.  You may find a test shows you
make more by taking donations.
