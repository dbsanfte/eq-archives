Just to back up what I said in my other reply:

http://www.rottentomatoes.com/games/browser.php?search=warcraft

WC3 got 79 positive review out of 79. WC3TFT got 21 out of 23....and
one of the review Rotten Tomatoes said was rotten gave it a 90+%, and
the other gave it a poor review because the reviewer thought the
single player was too hard. =/

Mind you, my own opinions were developed before I saw this. In fact, I
only bothered to check this out after reading your post. WC3 and the
expansion weren't perfect, but between my own experience, reading
forums and newsgroups, and the reviews above, I'd say that to say you
found it "rather poor" puts you in the minority. That doesn't make you
wrong, of course...just felt such a negative review needs to be
countered with the other end of the spectrum.

I can't comment on AOE, though.
