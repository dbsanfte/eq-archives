     Kisdean Gix spawns behind the merchants in (roughly) the middle of the
zone (more toward south-east side I believe, by the Befallen Zone and the
Toll Booth).  He is a difficult kill for lower levels, because of his harm
touch spell.  If you get past that and he is BLUE or EVEN to you it should
be fairly easy.

     Occasionally someone may inadvertantly agro him (or bite off more than
they can chew) then run toward populated spots for refuge.  Typically this
sucks for the innocent bystander not aware of trouble coming.  A polite
person would give /shout "Train _____ coming," although, in the thick of
battle it isn't always easy to squeeze the heads up out.

     I'd give someone the benefit of the doubt once or twice, but after
that...  "training" just becomes part of their strategy which I don't
believe is right.
