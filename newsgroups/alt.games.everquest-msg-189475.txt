Charm isn't completely reliable (Until DC, but that comes pretty
late), and enchanters just don't have the DoT-stacking power of a
necromancer. Also, necromancers can keep up pretty well with
Enchanters on mana regen. Bards take a lot more skill to solo
effectively (without training everyone in their path). Admittedly,
once they get swarm kiting down right, they're pretty damn fast
xp'ers, it's a rough skill to learn. Fear kiting with a Bard simply
can't match fear kiting with a necro.
