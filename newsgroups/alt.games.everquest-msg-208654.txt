Speaking of killing the unkillable...remember the old Atari arcade game
called Battlezone?  If you took too long to kill a tank, it would disappear
and a missile would be spawned.  Someone figured out the timing, and
arranged so that they were on their last tank, and a shot was coming toward
them when the timeout was reached, the enemy tank despawned, and a missile
spawned.  Then, before the missile reached them, they died on that shot that
was already on the way.

That ended the game, and the machine went into attract mode, where it plays
a demo.  Except that it didn't despawn the missile...so the missile killed
the demo tank!  The software did not handle gracefully having the demo tank
lose. :-)  The game crashed.

(Anyone who has a Battlezone...be careful if you try this!  The one time we
reproduced it, something burned out in the video subsystem.  It might have
just been coincidence...or it could be that video timings are under software
control on that hardware, and the crash left the video system in a bad
state.  The owner of the machine would not let us try again after he fixed
it).
