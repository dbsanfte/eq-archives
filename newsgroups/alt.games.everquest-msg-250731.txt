Well, I freely admit I don't know what a game engine really is... 
closest I can come, I suppose, would be to think of it in NWN terms.  I 
certainly wouldn't be happy to take a module I'd spent 5 years working 
on and try to convert it from NWN to SOU to HOTU to CEP... but what 
we're talking about is the reverse, trying to make the change to CEP 
while keeping the original module working.  It seems to me thats just 
what the NWN team has done.

But maybe they haven't really changed the "engine" just added new bells 
and whistles, similar to what you seem to be saying EQ has been doing. 
I don't know what the distinction is.

The point I'm trying to make, though, is that "most of the time" applies 
to a great many old school games, but EQ is something new, and perhaps 
applying the old thinking to it is wrong.  Maybe instead of EQ2, it 
Would be worth making EQ1.1, so as to keep the installed customer base.

Or maybe it wouldn't.

I once had a similar discussion with a man who owns a venue where I have 
a business.  I disagreed with a decision he was making about how many 
weekends we should be open.  He was willing to hear me out, but in the 
end, he said it was his money he was spending, and that meant the 
decision as to what to do there was his.  He was correct.

He was, as it turns out, wrong, we did much worse doing things his way 
than we had the previous several years doing it the original way.  But 
he was correct in that it was his gamble to make.

Its SOE's gamble to make, to do EQ2 instead of putting the same effort 
into EQ1

I hear this a lot too, and not just in the high end of the game.  The 
bugs and poor design choices thru all levels are part of the problem. 
Mudflation killing interest in the vast quantity of older zones, for 
example; how many times have we seen the idea mentioned that there 
should be modern quests which use old world stuff as a base?

Well, thats something I missed, being gone all that time, I suppose. 
DX9 isn't the first DX upgrade they've done, in the past such upgrades 
were... buggy, but we mostly just shrugged that off as SNAFU.  Was this 
that much more of a nightmare?

If it was, is that the fault of making a change, or was it sloppy work, 
or was it perhaps something to do with the DX people making such 
upgrades more difficult (Microsoft?)

Thanks for playing, I sometimes enjoy this newsgroup more than the game
