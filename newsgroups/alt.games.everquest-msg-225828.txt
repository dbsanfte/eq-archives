That could also be accomplished by a) giving Warriors stronger bumps up the
hate list, and b) ensuring that if a warrior hits the top of the hate list,
they're instantly put at least XX points ahead of anyone else.

I'm not saying the new abilities will be useless, in fact I'm looking
forward to them, but it seems a lot like fixing a muffler by getting new
rims.

You do have a point.  Abilities and spells are seen as "necessities," and
it's aggravating for me to know that when I hit 60, my new mez only comes
off a Velious effin' dragon.  But still, I stand that many of my raiding
friends will be interested in this, if not excited.  One in particular is a
65 warrior with a bazillion AA who says he feels useless.  It'll give him
something to look for.

Apparently so.  Thanks. :>

I wonder if some of the new abilities, or Endurance, will up that.

Ouch... What's he doing?  (My Ranger's only 23.)
