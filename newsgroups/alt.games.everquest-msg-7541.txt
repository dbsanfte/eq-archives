There are some other minor exceptions where twinking has caused problems. (Not that
I'm not doing it myself, mind you.)  One recent one was an ubertwinked monk in
Highkeep.  Though I was two or three levels higher, this guy was dishing out so
much damage so fast that I was unable to keep the mobs taunted off of him a lot of
the time, thus causing him to take more damage more quickly than I would have, and
becoming a mana drain on the healers.
