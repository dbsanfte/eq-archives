   Certainly for now.  It depends on what might go down when EQII is
actually up and playable, though.  If it has hugh numbers (and that will
depend on the word of mouth, I believe), then later it might be good to
create an usenet group just for it.

    Course, if it tanks, then any newsgroup devoted to it will wither
post haste also.  We will just have to see how it goes.
