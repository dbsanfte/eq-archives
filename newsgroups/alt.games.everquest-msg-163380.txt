Naturally the part about using a horse to gain mana while summoning food 
and drink off the velious gear was pretty much a joke, but the whole 
idea of getting a horse is definitely not a joke with all the outdoor 
PoPing (wohoo I invented a new word) going on today. :)

Melee on a horse on the other hand is best avoided as you don't get the 
manaregen when attacking and yaulp doesn't stack with the horse. What I 
do is click off the horse whenever I want to melee, then summon it back 
when I get tired of playing with the hammer. Summoning the horse is a 3 
second cast so it's not that bad.

Apart from the melee thing the only problem I have with the horse is 
that people who have luclin models on can have trouble trading with you. 
Just click it off and resummon after the trade.

I for one think that a horse is one of the single best investments a 
cleric can make today.

Oh, and if you have trouble using the horse without the models on try to 
turn off all luclin models, not only for your race/sex combination. 
After that you can experiment with turning on some models, but you might 
be stuck with old world models for all races.
