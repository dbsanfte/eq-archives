Playing with people with more experience at the game is the best way
to learn. They see what you are seeing and can give you concrete
advice.
For some concrete advice, get maps. Get your camouflage spell. Check
the gametime, and run through Kithicor during daytime, hugging the
zone wall on your left. Then, cross the commonlands to get to
Freeport. In East Freeport there is a soulbinder - use him.
Next, make a 'loc' hotkey. Hotkeys can be made in the 'Socials' menu -
you need one that will perform the action '/loc'. If you haven't
learned how to use location coordinates, do that. Also, work on your
sense heading skill.
Familiarize yourself with where zonelines are. If you get in trouble,
run for the zone line. Hit /loc to keep track of where you are in case
you die; that way you'll know where to find your corpse when you get
back. Also, make a /corpse hotkey to drag your body away somewhere it
is safe to loot it.
Don't be afraid to ask for help in game in /ooc, just be polite and
don't lose your temper, and people will usually be quite willing to
help if you are lost or if your corpse is lost.

Personally, my druid never zoned out of Greater Faydark till she was
level 8 : )
