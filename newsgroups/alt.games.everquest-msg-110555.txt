Walk up to the Nexus Scion, tell her you wish to journey to luclin, and
wait...eventually, the spire will fire, and you will be on luclin...if you
walk around in the nexus, there are named scions going to different parts of
norrath, just go stand in the spire for the place you wish to go to, and
wait...or go explore luclin....
