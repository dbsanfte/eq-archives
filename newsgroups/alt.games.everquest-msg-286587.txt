I figured i'd just log in for myself and get a few hours of exploring
done, but i ran into a snag i can't lick (do you lick snags? do you
untangle them?): i can't log my FV character - i tried and keep
getting a client crash error, something i never saw before. I go to
character select, see my lil beastie there (he's 71! that's cool!),
press "enter world" and see the screen pause; the little load-screen
bar pops up, loads the zone file(s) - which happens to be MPG, not
sure if that's relevant) - and the bar gets all the way across and the
gamma changes, right as it does when it's about to load up the
game ... but it gives me the client crash message and asks me if i'd
like to send my data in.

What gives?

I can log in all other characters just fine (my pvp toon, my toons on
FR, progression...).


Anyway, since the traffic here is so low, i'm going to go all "lance"
on you's and leave little progress updates =)

(Hopefully they'll be in-game stories...)
