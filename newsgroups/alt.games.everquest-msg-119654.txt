Are you saying (from an RP perspective), that a Necro/SK's feign death spell
should cause an out of body experience for the duration, causing the body to
have all reactions as if it truly dead (maybe even add the {'s corpse} to
the end of it but name remain in it's normal color so players could tell the
difference)?  This way the mob would not be able to notice the difference.
Maybe give a "has fallen to the ground in a lifeless heap." message to just
add to the effect?
