Nah, you misunderstood me:
"a disproprotionate number of the jerks and morons I've run into in
EQ have been Half Elves" COMMA
"mostly either Bards or female toons (oddly not often both)"
the parenthesized bit refers to "Bards or female", i.e. female Half Elf
Bards have rarely fit into the "jerks and morons" categories, but male
Half Elf Bards and female Half Elves of other classes have.  But, as I
said, it could be that I'm just more likely to remember them, it's not
like I keep a "jerks and morons" logbook while I'm playing.
