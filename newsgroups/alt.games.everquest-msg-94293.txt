Eww. Can you say "warrior go splat"?  If you're fighting anything that isn't
green at that level and trigger an AoE taunt to get EIGHT things on you,
they're gonna beat you into a bloody pulp real fast unless you've got a
quarter-second CH chain going.

When in doubt, ZERG!!!!  =P (no, I'm not in a zerg guild, we have so few
clerics we have to have good tactics)

Root parking stuff is a good idea, however if you're at that level, they
have a good chance of being able to summon, which kinda makes root parking
not work very well. "You will not evade me stupid_druid!"  it's even worse
if the druid is debuffing things.
