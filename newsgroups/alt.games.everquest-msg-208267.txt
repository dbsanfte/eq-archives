I understand that some of the mobs in Plane of Time that were previously
untargetable on that server are targetable now, and that some sundials that
went nowhere now have destinations.  A very welcome change over Velious -
instead of the first guild to do something shutting off content, the first
guild to do this opened up content.

The question is - can folks not on that first kill go through those portals?
Or is this the ultimate character flag?
