Its a pity people group with these idiots and get them xp, this inflicting
them on us in higher level zones. It reminds me of a day recently in DL (ok
its not a high level zone... just mid) where we had a totally useless iksar
shadow knight join us. We figure we'd ask a druid to join us, so this SK
could be sowed for pulling. "Oh, im not good at pulling, i cant pull" he
says. Time to kick him imo, but i wasnt leader, so the bard ends up pulling.
So we have all the agro on the bard, meanwhile the SK doesnt appear to be
taunting at all. Im pumping superior heal after superior heal into the bard
until I get agrod badly. meanwhile the druid is sitting there doing *nothing
at all*. No snare, no dot, do ds, and we arnt even sowed. Well I lived...
just.

Would have been real easy if the 45 SK (with symbol/valor) had taken the
agro and I'd used complete heal. No agro problems, no mana problems. Its
worse than the leachers in diablo... at least they dont get you killed.

"Seeya guys, time for me to go"
