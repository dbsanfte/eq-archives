You know the funniest thing? I've always been one of the most vocal 
proponents of a RP server in this newsgroup, from many years back. When 
FV went live, I created a character there within milliseconds. I took him 
(a mage) to level 4, and I've never played there since.

Nothing wrong with the server itself, or even the ruleset, it's the same 
reason I don't play my alts anymore... I can't abide running from 
something I would normally swat aside without a second thought.
