Hm. No, I'd probably still use them, but access to italics, bold text, 
and different font sizes would give me a wider set of tools, some of 
which could replace certain emoticons under some circumstances (perhaps 
small pink italics for irony?).

Well, it does. That is the entire point of the emoticon, isn't it? When, 
for example, any of my Irish coworkers tells me "Fuck off, you ignorant 
bollocks", I know *exactly* which way to take it by looking at his face 
and the tone of voice he uses. The emoticon simply conveys some of that 
same information.

I don't know, frankly... On the one hand, you've choosen to end your 
rant by elegantly proving my point, but on the other hand, you do seem 
to be subtly insulting me by suggesting that if I didn't get your exact 
meaning without emoticon help it's somehow my comprehension skills that 
are at fault, not to your writing skills.

So, well...
