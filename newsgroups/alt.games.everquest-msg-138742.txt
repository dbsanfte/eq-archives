"Absor: Yes.  No more than four pets can engage a single target"

The big thing about this is MAG and Necros are taking a big nerf with this
max 4 pets on single target..
AoW figth we have like 4 MAG and 4 Necros. Why should only 4 of the 8 people
have use for there pets. ?

 I just thinks its a big nerf to pet classes and its simply suxxoring... Its
like "Lets only max 4 melee be able to use hast items on same target"
Gives the same impact .. removes the damage they are used to make and it
would make peopel very unhappy..

If Verant stated this out clearly on the cereation meny of Pet classes there
would not be any new small MAG or Necros running around in Norrath anymore..

" Welcome to the Creation process of Necro or Mag... Just let me inform you
that when you are in the high endgame you loose the ability of your lovely
pet or epic that you spended soo much time to get. Please start a warrior or
cleric if you dont agree to this"

Soo Verant still Suxxoring since they wrote that pet rule..Max 4 Pets on
single target... GBHHAAA!!!!
