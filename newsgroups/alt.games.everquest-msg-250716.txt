I wouldn't say its needless to say...

There are a variety of tactics to deal with a mob like that...

Fear/Snare -- pull to a cleared area of the dungeon)

Mana drain (Bard ideally) -- it actually does eventually zero out most 
*most* mobs if he stays on it.

Nuke -- start *prior* to mobs CH casting point, get all your dots 
stacked up on it, and then before he starts his CH cast everyone 
simultaneously HT+Backstab+ClericNuke+EncNuke+WizNuke+whatever...against 
many mobs this will get them from before its CH point to its run point. 
Can't say in your case... but it might be worth a shot, especially if 
you've got a couple real nuke capable classes.
