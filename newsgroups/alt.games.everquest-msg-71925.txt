As i think I have mentioned before I run three characters . A 60 chanter , a
57 druid , and a 52 monk.

Every encounter requires dammage dealing and support . All casters are
support, none but a wizard is dammage dealing and he is only so in rare
circumstances. This leads to a 36 man raid being optimum at 1 chanter , 6
clerics , 1 druid maybe, 1 shaman , 1 necro maybe , 1 magician maybe , and
25-28 rogues warriors or monks with rogues preferred after you have just 2
warriors. For a mob that runs or gates and can be effected by magic you want
a few wizards to finnish it off before it can get far. There are 14 classes
and from a balance standpoint we would far prefer 2-3 of each class instead
of the mess we have now.

Single group tactics never did require a warrior . Single group tactics
never did require a cleric but the fact that s$%^ happens means that it is
always better to have a cleric around then to have to stop and hunt for one
when something goes wrong.

Dire charm may make my chanter into a dammage dealer but nothing will ever
make my druid one . My 52 monk can log 15k dammage in minutes which makes
the dammage dealing of casters seem silly , warriors are the same and rogues
just obscene. Take for example the grey, any of my characters can solo there
fairly easily but my druid will have to stop to med frequently, my chanter
takes forever to kill a mob , and my monk happily pulls one after another
and goes to town. If I group up it gets even better for melee not worse.
