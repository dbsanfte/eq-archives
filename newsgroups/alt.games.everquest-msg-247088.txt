History suggests either cutting or possibly bleeding edge, ie, it'll
be another two expansions before more regular players get a whiff.

I can just see it - a drop from AHR, Quarm, Cragbeast (which died last
night apparently), and one from all the LDoN raids, all needed for one

gear to complete shame... leading to it being nerfed into oblivion a
week later.

That would be typical.
