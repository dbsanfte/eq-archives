Originally it was to be your whole computer, but after a load of
whining by the player base about privacy and security the EQ devs said
they would only check your Everquest folder.  This all occured
roughly... three years ago?  When it went live we all recieved a new
user license agreement window thingy before log in before or after the
original user agreement window that you have to agree to every time.

There's got to be someone around this area who's played EQ for all or
the grand majority of EQ's lifespan like I did that knows what I'm
talking about.  O.o
