Pets would also attack another PC for no apparent reason whatsoever.  Owner 
is not LD, person being attacked did not cast an Eye or similar, and the 
owner could not back the pet off.  With a charmed pet, we had to have the 
enchanter invis to break charm so that we could attack the pet, it was 
still flagged as a pet, and thus not harmable by other PCs.
