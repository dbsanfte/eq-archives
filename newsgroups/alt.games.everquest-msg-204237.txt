It's still incredibly useful even for a shaman with insta-click sow.
I'll usually still have SoW up when hunting outdoors but not always.
Sometimes its actually more convenient to pull at the slower, run3
speed.

Headshot is pretty useless if it's limited to the same level of mobs
as the assassinate ability, which I think it is. But there's always
the 'fun factor'. 

Given the fact that you're a shaman pet, I'd seriously consider the
defensive AAs.  Shaman slow and decent equipment/AAs will mean that
you can tank in the tier2+ zones, otherwise you're gonna be looking
for a tank every time you go there. Even a shaman with torpor hits his
tanking limits pretty quickly in PoP. Unless you're seriously uber,
mobs that hit for 500 is about the max that your husband can tank and
that won't get you very far in PoP.
