Very nice post Spirit....I know I judged harshly and your post has made me
want to go back tonight and give the game another(longer) try.

What I most most irritated by was the total lack of unintuitive setup but I
guess that's my fault for not RTFM.

My first 2 characters were.....a dark elf and a cat :)

Yes, Evolution is what I bought(does that box include the "dungeons"
expansion?)  I noticed that during startup of the game it has a screen that
has that at the top....

I can live without a map and radar(DAoC) but I better be able to navigate by
learning my surrounding and having landmarks....I got lost several times
when I ran in one direction or the other for more than 30 seconds.  Knowing
know that there "is" a map will help things. Again I should have RTFM.

Not as demanding as most, my biggest gripe about any game is the interface
and ease of character movement.

Judging by your post you probably should start giving my opinions more
often...and you are correct about giving the game more time.

My eye is on LoTR....because I love the books and movies but mainly because
I'm hoping that Turbine creates another gem, no I'm not talking about AC2 :)
I'm just wondering though if games "tied" to a storyline(SWG) are helped or
hindered by it.  One of the big things for me about AC was it's originality.

That's true.
