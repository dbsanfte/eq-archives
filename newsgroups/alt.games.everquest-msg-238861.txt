Only levitation (or buffs with levitation, like Illusion: Imp and SoE) are 
stripped.  DA/DB will probably last all the way to the bottom (I've never 
been sure if zoning times count against buf duration or not!) but to be 
sure, the fall on the other side of the zone is long enough that you can 
get reasonably fast-casting spells off before you splat.  I'd recommend 
practicing a couple times with a level 1 Erudie cleric of Cazic, just to 
get the feel of it. :)

You can also get down safely with any character if you /q right after you 
zone and time it exactly right.  But that would be substantially riskier.  
Ahh, memories of Plummet, my level 2 Erudite SK. :)
