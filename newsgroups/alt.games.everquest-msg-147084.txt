Nope, that's it exactly.  60 tank singles human Ragefire (which may take a
while, but with buffs and a 60 cleric healing, shouldn't be a problem), then
grabs aggro on dragon form and holds it just long enough for MB wizards to
toast RF.

I understand about being nervous, wanting to get this exactly right.  I was
the same way.  =)  Be comforted by that fact that if you somehow manage to
lose and Ragefire despawns, all you have to do is start collecting shards
again - your Swirling Pearl is safe, and isn't needed until the final
combine with Ragefire's heart.

So it's not like if you fail RF you have to start all over.  Just need to
re-farm shards.

Good luck!  Let us know how it went.
