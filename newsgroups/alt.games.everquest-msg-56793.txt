A druid friend of mine pointed out that it's hard enough for a druid to have
much of a place in a large multigroup raid where evac isn't an option.  This
only hurts druids.

Playing a 55 enchanter as my primary I'm ALREADY the only enchanter required
for 4 or 5 groups so this doesn't hurt me at all and only helps.
