Hmm, I think our primary difference here hinges on the idea of regulated vs.
unregulated capitalism.  I do think there should be some government
oversight of industry.  But it should be just that, oversight.  Compare the
Surgeon General's warning labels to the recent Tobacco law suits.  The
former is an example of the government ensuring that the public was
informed, the latter was an unconstitutional attack on the tobaco industry.

Hmm, Canada, Mexico, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Bahrain, and Saudi
Arabia.  I know that's not exactly the most cosmopolitan itinary I could
have, but I think it's fairly broad.  Out of all of them, only Canada truely
compares, but the U.S. still has it beat in many respects.

If that were the case, then we would have an economy similar to european
nations.  What makes the U.S. an economic power house is that we do believe
in a free-market economy.  That also leads into why our economy has been
sputtering as of late.  We're strangling it with all those socialist ideas.
Capitalism and socialism are poison to eachother.  A little bit of socialism
in a market economy is like disengaging the clutch on a fast moving car.  A
little bit of capitalism in a socialist economy leads to it's collapse.

Agreed, that's a bad thing.  Still, it's only proof that there needs to be a
watchdog, not government control.
