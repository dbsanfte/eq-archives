I should hope so since it's the "latest and greatest" and only
costs $300 (probably more) :^)

That just proves how poor the current EQ engine is.  If you can't
run a 2+ year old game on todays best hardware (I've tried 1.3 GHz
CPU and a GeForce3) without the (IMO) serious framerate problems,
that's just plain poor coding.  I can't imagine what EQ must have
been like when it was released in the era of the Pentium...

This is why I'm so excited about Luclin.  I'm nowhere near
finished exploring all the zones that I have with Kunark and
Velious, so I don't really need the new zones.  It's the new
engine that I'm waiting for!  Hopefully, an engine that will
bring EQ performance at least as high as the $9.99 Deer Hunter
package at Wal-Mart <snicker>...
