Not really.

Hate refers to the mobs hate list,  your relative position on it, and
the accumulation of 'hate' to change your relative position on it, by
proximity, sitting, taunting, and dealing damage/spells etc.

Aggro refers to the mobs current target. To pull aggro, to get
aggroed, to have aggro all mean the mob is now attacking you. To lose
aggro means the mob is attacking someone else.  The mob aggros the
person highest on the hate list.

The word aggro is also used to describe the event of a mob goes from
idle to engaged. But that isn't really a different use, you can pull a
mob by various means (from whacking it to simply getting too close),
you are added to the previously empty  the hate list... and the mob
now has a target to attack... so you've aggroed it. (Ie you are the
mobs current target, same meaning as before).

I wouldn't use the word hate here. Its either faction related or its
simply an aggressive mob that attacks anybody. The word 'hate' is
semanticaly appropriate, but since 'hate' already has a specialized
meaning elsewhere I'd skip using it here.
