I cannot imagine playing the hours some people play with that horrible music
constantly repeating.  After the first day of playing the game, I set my
music volume to zero.  LoY turned it back on, so I turned it back off.  If I
had to listen to that music all the time, I wouldn't play.  No the sound
volume and realism are both cranked.  Pisses my wife off when a thunderstorm
starts, because with the subwoofer, she can feel the thunder across the
room.

Cheers,
Eric
