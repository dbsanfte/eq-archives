Netted kelp from siren's is all/all, and looks like funky velious leather.

The ice goblin skin would be from the elite guards (or one of the others
around them) in the king room before you get into the ice giant section.
They are a very, VERY common drop. When I am playing buff monkey for vox

they are lore).
