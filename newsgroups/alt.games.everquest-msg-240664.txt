You won't have enough training points. And it will get pricey. Better
to work most skills up with practice. For weapon skills grouping or
'borrowing' mobs from other groups is best. Not letting them get to
far behind is also a good idea... and once your in your 30s this isn't
hard to do... until then you level so fast you almost can't help but
leave them behind.

Food and Water is probably a little eccentric. Cash definately, and my
bank is full of weapons... but mostly because i rotate them to work
skills, not for CRs.

I usually do CRs naked, although if I happen to pass a decaying
skellie I'll take his rusty sword... its lousy by comparison and being
naked is not good for taking hits... but most CRs are accomplished
wihout any combat at all.

Only a particularly difficult CR would need much equipment. (And
certainly nothing below 45th level would qualify...) Until that level
*any* death is *easily* recovered from by hiring a necro or other
help...
