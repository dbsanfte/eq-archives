I only saw it active for one day (it may have been for longer, I only
saw it that one day). I logged in to try it, popped in as a froglok in
lguk. My guild was having an event in lguk about a week later, so I
took advantage of the opportunity to explore the zone. It's nice being
able to walk around a dungeon knowing that you are perfectly safe.
