I'v gotten so sick of people insisting on a particular type of
adventure.  It drives me nuts with the leader calls off the adventure
type he's gotten, and one holdout says "no, I only do adventure type
x".  I used to think that the hard part was putting together the group
but it seems now like that's the easy part, the hard part is getting
an adventure people agree on.

I wish that the leader just got "an adventure" and you didn't know
what it was until you zoned in.
