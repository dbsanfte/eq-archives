Poor choice of words: young could be new players, low level players, or 
actual young players. I doubt you mean young players, and new players 
are not low level long if they don't want to be.

The players with years of play behind them know where these are. The new 
high level players frequently do not, and when they find out it requires 
a port to here, a run to there, and a hop-skip-and-jump they say forget 
it, not interested, and go back to BoT or LDoN...
