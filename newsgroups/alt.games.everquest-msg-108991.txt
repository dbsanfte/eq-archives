I doubt it. Allakhazam's site provides the vast majority of its useful
information for free (and what they don't have, other sites do). The
premium service gets you some perks, like improved search abilities,
but nothing that would be considered essential.

In fact, you could play the game without any web site information at
all. After all, that's the boat we were all in when the game first
came out!

>It sounds like a good buy, either way.

Wait and see if you're still playing EQ in a few months. No point in
sending money to Allakhazam's if later you decide that EQ just isn't
your cup of tea.
