Most people here have tried it.

DAoC is better written than EQ, the program is smoother, runs better on
machines of lower spec (the sort that Luclin would laugh hysterically at if
you tried to install it on them) and, in many cases, looks better (combat
animation, anyone?).
The game play is geared toward preparing for RvR, the level grind part is
much easier with less down time but for some reason is unfulfilling and
after 10th I was finding each level very dull.
The look of the land in DAoC is very samey for each realm (there are dungeon
zones in there to break up the monotony) and doesn't capture the imagination
as EQ zones do but DAoC is still a fledgling compared to EQ so give it time.

RvR is still a little flawed, they have already nerfed the archer/hunter
class once and may end up doing it again (which will prolly ruin that class)
there is also the problem that the frontier zone will often crash when a
full assault is going on (one of the tactics of the defenders is to stick as
many players in the zone as possible to crash it and give them chance to
mount a proper defence) but saying all this it still looks like a blast when
watching my friends play (all ex EQ'rs)

DAoC has that bane of so many EQ players (don't ask me why) a trivial loot
code (no loot off white mobs) this is a good thing imo.

Downtime is far less, mana and health regen much faster than in EQ on top of
this, at any level a character has a 50/50 chance of taking out a yellow
(equal to) mob, melee classes have special attacks (basically spells, use
endurance rather than mana) which means they are capable of soloing. Some
characters are more powerful than others when it comes to this (the Midgard
Runemaster, I have heard, is very comparable to a Necro from EQ in this
respect)

Mythic have set themselves up as the Anti-Verant, whatever verant have done
in the past that has drawn criticism they have made sure they don't.

1 month free play, of course if you don't like it afterwards you can't
return the product but at least you can trial it free for a month, I was
impressed by this. Verant have since released EQ as a demo with 2 weeks free
play on Magazione cover disks.

Trade skills are worth while, profitable and more user friendly. This is
still the most improved part of the game for me, over EQ (anyone that has
ever tried smithing in EQ and then tried it in DAoC will attest to this)

Quests are much easier, you are given one, the mobs are no where near as
rare and will always drop the item required (afaik they do anyway) on top of
this, if you are in a group and have all initiated the quest you will ALL
get the quest drop. Players can only initiate a quest once, you only get one
shot (so don't go selling quest items to vendors) but this also eliminates
people farming the quests (LSoEE anyone?)

Unfortunately, for all the good things I can name of DAoC I prefer EQ. EQ
captures the imagination more, has far more races/class options and a
greater sense of achievement for playing. I never once felt attached to my
characters in DAoC as I did to my Warrior after a few days of playing him.
One day I will tire of EQ and maybe move across to DAoC but at the moment
that day seems to be a long way off.

The only reason I can see for playing DAoC in place of EQ is if you don't
enjoy EQ, if you are enjoying EQ I think you may find that Dark Age falls
short of your expectations.
