Hi everyone:

I have always found a positive way of using my spells, but for the life of
me I have to wonder why Wizards are given a level *59* spell that to all
intents and purposes has very, very little use. From what I can see the
Flaming Sword of Xuzl costs 700 mana to cast, it cannot be cast whilst my
Familiar is with me, the Flaming Sword has 150 hit points, dies after the
mob is dead and has a one minute recast time.

Can someone give me some pointers as to why this spell is worth casting?
Yes, in a raid situation where the mob has very high resists it *might* be
useful, but the puny 150 hit points it has isn't enough to keep it alive for
long enough to warrant 700 mana. Am I missing something obvious with this
spell? Gee, it doesn't even *look* like a Flaming Sword .. LOL .. I cetainly
feel cheesed off at a 59 spell being so useless ..

Would have been nice to have cast this and have the *pet* kill a Hill Giant
in Rathe Mountains .. /shrug ..

As always, thank you, and safe hunting to you all ..

Stevie.
