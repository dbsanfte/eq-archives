This is from your other message....

:Oh, and Jazz? I've just spent over a thousand dollars of my wife's money to
:get myself moved down here, us married, and continuing to eat/be online,
and
:we can't afford to buy Christmas presents for our friends/relatives. Tell
me
:exactly how buying new computer parts/OSes is a viable option?

You ACTUALLY have being online(I'm assuming to play EQ) as an equal level in
life as eating....Now, if you're serious about this and it appears you are,
you have a serious problem, my friend....If you take this as an insult, then
you're just dening it.....In general the NG is full of very helpful people,
and I'm not AT ALL trying to insult you....I'm a fellow gamer, too...and
priorities need to be realized....Other people in the group are trying to
tell you the same thing....wake up...Cancel the account and spend time with
the new wife....
