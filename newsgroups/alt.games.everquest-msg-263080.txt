Hey guys,

I rolled up an alt Berserker. Got him to 16. Okay, he's twinked (CiC for 
regen, solid weapons, decent AC, 20kpp worth of stuff aside of the CiC 
and weapons) - not going to group him a ton. More to have a bit of fun 
soloing..  I'm stuck at lvl 16 and looking for places to make good 
experience.

1-4 = newbie zone
4-6 = Blackburrow
6-12 = Paludal Caverns
12-16 = Kurn's Tower
16-60 = ????

I tried going PC to do the soloing non-bandit camps, but i cant seem to 
get past B2 as strangely enough on my server (Mith Marr) PC seems to be 
near empty 95% of the time now and B2 is generally vacant at the times 
that I play. I don't particularly want to fight the Phlargs because even 
though I have the CiC they still hit me (hardish) and infect me with the 
crud which literally takes away the effect that the CiC has on me (well 
minimises it at best).

Since the only other character I've played up to a 'high' level (53) has 
been a cleric (Ytoojae if you're on Mith Marr) I'm not too well versed 
in the soloing path.

If anyone could advise a path to 60 (thats ideally where I'd like to 
take the berserker) soloing I'd appreciate it.

Last place I tried was the Warrens where I met a white kobold that 
conned dark blue to me at which point I decided to beat it to 70% quite 
easily to where it cast Fear on me and I had half the zone on my tail 
(empty zone otherwise) and I luckilly got to the exit before death. Not 
fun!!

Thanks,

A.C.
