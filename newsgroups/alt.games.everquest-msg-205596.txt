    Might be true for tier I, but Plane of Earth (tier IV) is better XP for
a full group than ever before. Each kill in a group of six is roughly a blue
of AA XP. And these are blue mobs we're pulling, not evens or yellows.

    Depends on your gear. Before the blue range was extended I was able to
solo light blue mobs in Nadox (the Blackhand Guardians, for the Pure Blood
quest) and Velk's without having to sit and med between pulls. Presumably, I
can still solo them. They were killable without a damage shield potion, so
with one I imagine it would be fairly simple even for folks with lesser
gear. I noticed when helping someone's twink through trials recently that I
can solo the Enforcers/Punishers in Justice, but I bet that was a very
strong function of AC. They are mostly blue, with the odd light blue, at 65.

    One of the lesser-geared clerics in my guild holds down Disco in Sebilis
solo. His gear would still be above yours, I'd assume, but that gives you
some idea of what you may be capable of doing. Remember, when it comes to
DPS you and I have roughly the same damage output when doing standard cleric
porcupine soloing. I regen mana better, I take less damage due to superior
AC/resists, and I have a larger margin of error due to higher HPs and MANA,
but that's it. And considering I finish most of these targets with mana at
full less the last SE I cast, I would think you could kill them and have
reasonable med time between kills.

    Here's the Magelo of the Disco cleric I mentioned:
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=528906 I'd say the biggest
differences between him and yourself would be Mana Preservation IV and his
AC. Remember to subtract off the stats on his Writ and substitute the stats
on his Hammer of Damnation when deciding how far ahead of you he is in a
given stat. And for reference, here's my Magelo:
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131561 - I'm turning into a
bit of a tank these days. ;-)
