On Wed, 16 Jun 2004 12:52:12 GMT, I needed a babel fish to understand
Lewzephyr <lewiszephyr@clotmail.com> :

>Collision Updates
>-----------------------
>Many remaining collision issues have been fixed.
>-Floating NPCs in the Plane of Disease should be more down to earth.
>-NPC warping should be reduced.
>-The Emerald Jungle should no longer have NPCs below the world
>-You should once again collide with the dock in Natimbi.
>-The entrance to Najena should be easier to navigate.

Got to be happy about these

>Gunthak Portal
>-----------------------
>-We have added a tome to the Plane of Knowledge to allow for faster

Glad to see this... ya im lazy and like a port or fast travel

>Gates of Discord
>-----------------------
>-Gates NPCs that dropped spells will now drop a token, which can be

I dont supose teh token will be dropable

>The Plane of Hate
>-----------------------
>You can now access the Plane of Hate by talking to Relm M'Loch in the
>Plane of Tranquility and handing her a Fuligan Soulstone.  *

I know a few wizards that are gunna be upset about this.

>-The drop rate has been increased for the following items in the Plane
>of Hate *
> The Shattered Emerald of Corruption
> Decrepit Hide
> Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth

I know some people working on their epic will be very happy

>-Gates smithed weapons have been adjusted. *
>-Gates fletched arrows have had their damage increased and are now

>enhanced. *

I am eager to see what these specific changes are

>Stopcasting
>-----------------------
>We have added a /stopcast command -- This command will not work when
>riding a horse. *

So whats the point... Duck always worked just the same...  And on that
note, hotkeys (and id think thats what this command was ment for) dont
work while your casting... so... um just duck again?  seems to be a
wasted command... maybe somone else can enlighten me on the use of
this.

>Undead Pets
>-----------------------
>Pets no longer go away after their master has feigned death for more
>than 2 minutes. *

/cheer

>Mouselook
>-----------------------
>Mouselook is much smoother and variable via a slider in the options
>window. If you use mouselook, make certain you adjust the new
>settings. 

Sounds interesting... cant wait to see.

>Tutorial
>-----------------------
>All characters should start with the tutorial bank items. 
> 
>Filters
>-----------------------
>-The Focus effect should now filter haste messages.  *
>-The Damage Shield filter should now work correctly.

Hmm... looks like they missed one..   When using Tell Windows and
doing a Reply to someone who is zoning... if you get the (qued)
message it goes to the Other window.   But I am glad to see they fixed
those two.
