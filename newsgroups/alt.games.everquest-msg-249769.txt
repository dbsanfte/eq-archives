I used a buddy code to start a new account and created a wizard.  During 
character creation I selected a name and after it was approved the new 
Tutorial automatically launched and I went thru it.  Afterwards I had my nice, 
new charm and everything was good.  On my other account I created another 
character so I could have 2 new characters to play together.  However on this 
one the tutorial did not start automatically.  I had to exit the game and 
relaunch it and then click the tutorial button on the character select screen 
to get to the tutorial.  Then when I got there I did not get the walk thru and 
the talking like I did on the other account.  I did walk around to all the 
npcs and get my charm and then do as much as I could remember to upgrade the 
charm.  Now that I'm done I must of missed something because my charm isn't as 
powerful as the one that I got on the other account.  Is this normal?
