I was in QH when the battle started.  I heard someone yell that a
massive number of high level gnolls had just come flying out of Black
Burrow heading to SFG.

As I stuck my head out of the tunnel, it seemed like a hundred gnolls
- all 55+ - were attacking the Jaggedpine soldiers and archers.  Total
mayhem.  There was no GM or Guides on the scene, and - unlike other GM
events - when you died from getting caught in the cross fire, you lost
exp.

I sat up on the hill with my level 30 druid and just watched the
action,  It was amazing.  A couple of guildies ported in to join in
the fracas.  There were three or four waves of high level gnoll
attacks before it all ended.  Some folks looted some neat gear, but
the stack of corpses of players told the story better.

Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note itï¿½. Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle.
