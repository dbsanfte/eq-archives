I would of suggested taking a break.  I was at a point 2 or 3 times where I
had done everything I wanted to do.  got a few uber items and was like,
well, there is nothing more I can accomplish.  But you don't seem to wanna
take a hiatus just yet.

I would suggest going to knew places and doing new things.   You will find
your stuck in a rut or bored when you set yourself up to be bored.  Like not
wanting to group with others or only wanting to stay in one area.  there are
things you can kite at around 34th that would be a challenge, like HG's in
west karana or oasis.  Grouping in EQ is a big part of the game, and not all
groups bicker.  You'll find the occasional great group that accomplishes
alot and everyone is happy to be in it.

You could also try a new server like the PvP one and build up a new
character for the purposes of doing PvP.  that in itself would be an
interesting exp.  there is a big difference between what I did when starting
EQ to what I do now with new characters.  at around 10th level traveled all
around to see the sights.  There are tons of zones I have never been in
still, and lots of things even the high levels haven't done.  Like I have
never been to kedge, the underwater dungeon.  Never been to the dungeon in
Odus that is a relatively beginner dungeeon like 1 to 20th.  That Odus
dungeon I don't even remember the name to, and it was before warrens came
out.

At the highest levels is when you really get to experience more of the game.
At 35th you still cannot dare to go certain places or you will get smacked.
There is a certain security in knowing your safe to run thru an area and
nothing can really touch you, and if they do, its not a big deal.

You also don't have to be in a full group to have fun, you could try a 2 or
3 person group.  Snaring and fearing (reverse kiting) is alot of fun, and
just one of the options in a small group.

GL and eventually by default you will either quit or find something fun in
EQ again.
