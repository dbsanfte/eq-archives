Why exactly should people who don't have time to play EQ be put in a 
position where they are being encouraged to spend more money on the 
hobby then those that play it 24x7?

Given that EQ isn't actually competitive, why do we need mechanisms to 
allow them 'to compete'? What exactly is the harm in letting people who 
play 1/2 as much only get 1/2 as far (or equivalently take twice as long 
to get to the same place)

I golf half as much as my father. I don't expect that I should golf as 
well as him. If I play EQ half as much as you why should I be worried or 
concerned that I have only progressed half as far? With respect to 
playing with friends and stuff gear/levels can be barriers... and there 
are better solutions than simply selling gear and levels so you can keep 
up. (e.g. CoH's)

[as an aside, the 1/2 time 1/2 progress equation doesn't actually work. 
It should but it doesn't. There are are some flaws to EQs design with 
respect to guilding/raiding that tends to penalize people who play below 
a certain threshold so that they cannot progress no matter how much time 
they sink into the game... parts of eq like pop/god progression require 
a critical mass. You can get time flagged if you play every day 12 hours 
a day for 20 days. (or 240 hours). But playing 1 hour a day for a year 
(365 hours) will likely not get you even your first flag. Add another 
year, and they will likely still not have moved forward... But this is a 
separate issue entirely]
