Matter of fact, I think VI's learned some lessons.

I can remember when 2k people on a single server crippled
the entire game for everybody on the server.

VI was probably praying for only 20% of the subscriber base to

And remember, from a BUSINESS standpoint, the best
customer for VI is one with 4 Legends accounts that never
logs on.
