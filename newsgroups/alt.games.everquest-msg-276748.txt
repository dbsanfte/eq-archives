Any standard red/blue glasses will work.  You may have one already
from an old 3D movie, comic books, some Nintendo games, etc.

The added driver just adds the 3D support to any NVidia cards. It has
the ability to sue 3D move, it just need to driver to add the feature
and make it work with many 3D games.

I have done as told in other post and while the worlkd is mostly
red/blue rather than the usual full color, it does have 3D effect that
almost makes you want to keep using the red/blue glasses.

I only saw the option for red/blue glasses, no other 3D mode at this
time with the current video driver.  I do wish they would use the LCD
shutter glasses so I can get the 3D effect but in full color.  And I'm
begining to think it won't happen as LCD monitor are becoming more
popular.  LCD monitor and LCD glasses wouldn't work together well
(ever wear polarized sunglasses?  You'd notice you can see the LCD
display only if you're viewing it at a certain angle or it's all
black)
