Check the BECN/DE loss rate between the two domain demarcs . I would agree
that it could be done if the total distance was in the neighborhood of
20-100 miles. But jeez, if what you are saying is true, I must have a
private jet that takes me back and fourth to work every day, averaging
600mph, tis would still be a 3 hour drive.

 I must really love my job.
