That's sorta kinda wrong. You don't consume food/water *when you're
in trader mode*. When out of it, you do. My trader hasn't left the
bazaar since the day she ran in there, the day she was created, and
I am usually only out of trader to run buy something I want to buy
or run to the bank and back to restock on merchandise and drop off
money and, in the past year and a half that she's been there, I've
had to buy probably four stacks of water and four stacks of food
because I *do* sell stat food. If you don't sell stat food, then
I guess you could put up with the 'You are out of food and water'
messages if you wanted to.
