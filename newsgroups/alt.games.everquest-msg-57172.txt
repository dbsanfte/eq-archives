90 million native americans? OH PLEASE. You are seriously trying to claim
that european settlers killed a population equal to 1/3rd of the current US
total (and let's bear in mind that populations have grown exponentially in
the last hundred years)? How funny. If you took the total number of native
americans between the years of 1492 and 2001 I bet that total wouldn't come
anywhere NEAR 90 million, and you sure as hell can't blame the death of
even *most* of that number on the conquering european settlers.
