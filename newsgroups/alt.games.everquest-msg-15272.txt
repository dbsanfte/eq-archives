Which bit of 'mung to save graphics' are you choosing to ignore????? This
whole thing is dne to keep the game sensible, limiting icons but giving
a sensible action to go round the limitsof the system...you have to look
at somethinf even if its distinctive...the inspect thing is simply the in
game mechanism used to perform it...a I have said before IMO it is not
valid to attach more to it than that.

They are distinctive, its an artficial system to save graphics...thats
been my major point.

You would know if is FCUK or Hilfiger..the 'need to look at the tag'
analgy falls down on reference to design in the real world and come on,are
you telling me its unreasonable to have items distinctive...Verant make
that choice anyway not us....we are playing the heroes :)

Ooooooh big assumptions to cover your argument....In game I say or do
nothing on this line that you quote....here I am arguing the case for my
point of view, I am well aware of the fact others think differently.

Dont invent my behaviour to cover your butt in a discussion.
