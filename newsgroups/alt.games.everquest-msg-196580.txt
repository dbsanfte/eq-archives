My wood elf druid is getting a kick out of this thread, though it still
irritates me to look half naked when fully dressed.
So I was reading some of the thread to my boyfriend.  Here's his two cents
worth:
"If the opportunity to check out porno presents itself I'll take a look.  If I
really want a cheap thrill though I always come back to you".  
I laughed my fool head off.  I don't know whether to be insulted or not....
