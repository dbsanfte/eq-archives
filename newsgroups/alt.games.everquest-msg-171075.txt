Ugh, I'm right there with you.  2800 miles from my polling place. :/

Shame about that last election, then.  Looks like one side has a pretty 
free hand now. :/

}We don't officially.  However, when it comes to how laws are applied, it's
}always the christians to whom the first ammendment doesn't apply.

Oh, cry me a river.  When I can pull currency out of my pocket that says 
"In the god(s) and/or goddess(es) of [insert your faith here] we trust", I 
might begin to take you seriously.  Even that, I'd expect atheists to have 
a gripe with.  Why don't we just eliminate the phrase altogether?  Oh, 
that's right, putting a monotheistic-specific name there is "non-specific" 
religous speech.  That's a laugh, isn't it?

When the Pledge of Allegiance no longer says "under God", when a Christian 
cult is raided for their tacky vampiric transubstantiation practices, when 
they stop demonizing Commmunists by pointing out how sinfully Atheist they 
are, when there's actually discussion of whether or not it's appropriate 
to post the Wiccan Rede in courtrooms, -then- we can talk about 
Judeochristians getting short shrift.  Till then you're a penguin in the 
arctic bitching about how warm it is.

}It is exemplary in comparision to all other economic models in use today.  I
}wouldn't even call it the lesser of many evils.  It's more of a transparent
}system, at worst.  We always hear how communism would work with perfect
}people.  Well, capitalism would also work (in fact, it would still be
}superior, as it would allow every person to contribute what they could
}without the pains of strict regulation) with perfect people.  However,
}capitalism can also work well with imperfect people.

I don't know about that.  It would depend strongly on your notion of what 
constitutes 'perfect' for people.  Capitalism relies on people's 
self-interest in order to function just as much as theoretical communism 
relies on their altruism.  I'd say that 'perfect' people would have a 
healthy balance of altruism and self-interest, a condition in which 
capitalism should work fine.  But mine is not the only way to see it.

}Who said anything about defining?  We define the groups to fit a certain
}cluster of beliefs.  I've never understood why some people are so determined
}to not fit into a category that they shun labels, no matter how useful they
}may be.

The fact that many of us cannot be pigeonholed in one of the major 
categories put forth tends to make those labels less useful.  You yourself 
have objected to being pigeonholed in certain categories.  Why would we be 
any different?

If you simply must label me, put me somewhere between Libertarian and 
Anarchist, with a dash of Liberal and a generous side order of Moderate.

What's the label for that this week? "Independent"?

}A conservative politician is much more likely to do something I like, that's
}why he's considered conservative.

That seems backward...  I didn't realize you were the sole arbiter of 
which side of the spectrum candidates fell on.

}It's kinda like how I'm considered
}partisan because I pretty much will never vote for a democrat.

It may suprise you to know that that's not why you're considered partisan.  
Statements like the one quoted prior would be much closer to the reason.  
"If I like it, it must be conservative" is a very partisan view, almost as 
partisan as "If it's conservative, I must like it."

It's funny, too... because you say all that, and then I see most 
conservatives disagreeing with you on some to many counts...

}I'm told I should "vote for the person, not the party."  Well, if the 
}party would stop sending up people who's politics I loathe, maybe I 
}would.

That's why I vote for so few Libertarian candidates.  Did these guys even 
read their party platform?

}Yet, it's not the Democrat party's failure to reach out to conservative 
}voters that's the issue, it's clearly my own rigid thinking.

Or it could be that Democrats spend so much time reaching out to 
conservative voters and ignoring their supposedly liberal constituency 
that they just end up looking like a bunch of mealy-mouthed pansy-asses 
with no vision or ideals whatsoever.

Your own rigid thinking frequently seems at odds with your rigidly-stated 
party affiliations, though.  That, to me, suggests partisanship.  You toot 
the conservative horn without looking objectively at what the conservative 
horn's been saying.
