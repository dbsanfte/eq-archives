If they are in fact different spells, then I could easily believe
it.  Heck, I could even believe that Verant has hidden numbers that alter
the resists based on class, simply because I don't put anything past them.

I'd need hard data to say for certain, but for years I've been hearing it
said that enchanters don't get resisted as much, so either it's a very
persistent legend perpetrated by a strong group of whining shaman, or it
has some basis in reality.  It's anyone's guess in EQ which is the case.

And even if it is the case...

... it doesn't sound like resists are what is holding up the shaman in
your guild. :9
