What is wrong with it is that you never learn how to manage your mana pool.
You get into the habit of assuming you can nuke everything to death.  That's
bad.  If I am passing through PoK or Nexus and someone says they are
offering it, I'll grab it.  I won't pay because I don't really need it.  Do
things slow down solo wothout it?  Yes.  Grouped?  No.  Is it a necessity to
playing the game at level 1-45?  Not at all.  Above 45?  Nope, not
necessary.  All it does is make the casters lazy about mana management.
