With appalling frequency.

YOu are thinking of people you meet In Game.  But I'll give you one 
example, how about Teapray?  Clearly everyone with any sense who's met 
her here would want to play on her server... but you either have to 
start over or pay to move, naked.  Now you can pay to move with all your 
gear.

Well, no, you can't, since she's safely hanging out on FV, one of the 
few servers you can't move to... but if she was on Brell or something.

There are dozens of people you meet regularly here on AGE, spread out 
over at least  dozen servers.

But worse than that, for me, is that I meet RL people who turn into 
friends and who turn out to play EQ.  What do you think the odds are 
that they happen to play EQ?  Since there's no regional breakdown of 
servers or anything, the odds are about 1 in 40 (or however many servers 
actually exist)

If I could pay a dollar to move to another server, I'd do it with some 
frequency.  Hop from MT to Terris Thule to meet up with one friend, hop 
over to Brell to hook up with a bunch of AGE'rs for an impromptu raid, 
so on and so forth.

At $75, I'm not so inclined, even though its a 65 cleric I'd be moving 
around.

There's an old story where this guy offers a girl a million dollars to 
sleep with him, she says yes, then he says he doesn't have a million 
dollars and offers her 500 dollars.  "What kind of girl do you think I 
am?" she says, and he replies "we've already established what kind of 
girl you are, now we are just arguing price".

I'd move from one server to another with all my gear for a fee, now we 
are just arguing price.
