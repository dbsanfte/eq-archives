Hi,

I started a Human Necro the other day, and, not knowing the class well,
wonder about faction. I was brave enough to try Neriak, and got in, but was
warned abotu the Third Gate. Can a human Necro worshipping Inny go there?
where in Neriak CAN'T they go safely? Plus, how is GFay? Im assuming that
Butcherblock is a death trap to Necros seen by the guards, but I certainly
could be wrong, since my necro is human. Merely want to here from those who
know first hand.


Thanks in advance!
