Uberguilds on my server seem to be done with their Giant phase and now
just run around killing everything, with a bit more time spent in Kael
to farm faction.

I just have my doubts that Jakugg's guild is necessarily on Kael

Jakugg, you might have been joking with most of the post, but the last
two lines in your post just looked like a bitter, jealous kid.
