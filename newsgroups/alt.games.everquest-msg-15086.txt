Ah - but - isn't powerlevelling a *bad* thing?  Again, I admit I'm highly 
independant and help given when not asked for is near to an insult for me 
- so that's probably not helping, but still... it'd be nice to be able to 
play the game without having to worry about constant interference.  (And 
again - I wasn't taking any damage from the mob, so it wasn't a problem)
