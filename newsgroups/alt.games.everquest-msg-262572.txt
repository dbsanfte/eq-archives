World War II was unjustified?  That's an interesting opinion...

In any case, your logic is flawed.  Even if a country has never fought
in a war, that doesn't mean they shouldn't have a military.  A military
is still important as a defensive measure, at the very least.

I'm not suggesting America should never go on the offense.  But it has
to be justified with real evidence -- not manufactured evidence -- and
the president has to tell us the truth -- not lie.

George W. Bush is a liar.  And he'll get to keep lying for 4 more
years.  Whoopee.
