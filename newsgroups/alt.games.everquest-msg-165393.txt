Too slow?  30dly?  lol.  Most of my melees did their early 2h training
with weapons that had delays of 40+, because that was all that was
available to them.  You youngsters are so spoiled.  :-p  (Aside:  It
is possible for a L10 Paladin to reliably kill wisps with a Bloodforge
Hammer (2hb 13/50) while wearing patchwork, take a "modern" lowbie,
twinked with maybe 100pp worth of trash, most anywhere in the old world
and you will find yourself way more powerful than the mobs.)

True.  But if you don't particularly care, or if it's an RP thing, 2hs,
1hs, and 1hb cover most of the common easily acquired weapons.

Somehow I doubt that any Warrior who acquired a Willsapper would need
more than a few days to work up the skill.  My Paladin, in his early
50s, worked piercing up from the 50s to the 150s in two not very long
sessions, using a Centi Warspear.  :-p  Skill gains slow above 160 or
so, but by then the weapon is usable so it's not a problem unless you
are totally lacking in friends (and even I'm not that unlikable).
