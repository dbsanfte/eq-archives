For solo, I'd suggest you get a boat from Freeport toward Butcher Block.
When the boat stops at Sister Island in Ocean of Tears, jump off the left
side of the boat and swim to the first island there.  Then turn right 90
degrees and swim to the next island.  If you are familiar with the area,
you'll probably know I'm talking about the gargoyle island.

If you are up to it, try and quad the specs on the hilltop.  Unlike the
specs in Oasis, these in OOT can be single pulled.even though they are very
close together.  At least, at level 45 (when I found them) they tended to
come alone.  Pain in the butt if you intended to quad, as you'll have to
circle around a few times to pull them all.  But nice if you just want to go
one-on-one.

If nobody is there killing gargoyles for their eyes, you should go ahead and
kill all of them first.  Otherwise, they will agro you even though they are
green to you.  The gargoyles and skeletons are placeholders for one another,
so make sure every mob on the island is a skeleton or spectre.

Just to be polite, though, when you leave you should kill a few skellies.
The skeletons and gargoyles will supposedly fight each other, and the
gargoyle will always win.  So if you kill a skeleton or two before you go,
the gargoyles that pop should cycle the entire island back to gargoyles by
the time anyone else comes to hunt for eyes.

I would bind on shore and gate out to bank.  Easy, fast exp, and good cash
to boot.
