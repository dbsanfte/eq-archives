I was responding to a complain that's, frankly, quite assinine. You're
complaining about changes that have, at worst, zero impact on you. At
best, they improve things for you even if you didn't buy LoY. I'm not
complaining about your decision to quit or even that you don't like
the game anymore overall. The *specific* complaint expressed was
stupid. That's what I'm criticizing. The complaint made the previously
drop-only spell *more* accessable, even if you can't research them
yourself. How the fuck can that *possibly* be a bad thing?

If you wonder why I call you a whiner and a moron, you might want to
review where you read too much into anything anyone says that doesn't
agree with you.

What is the new direction you disagree with? That they're making the
game more fun because of conveniences and options added in? Heaven
forbid they actually make the game more enjoyable!
