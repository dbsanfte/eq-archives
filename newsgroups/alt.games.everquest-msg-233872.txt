LOL!!  Poor cats!!  It was uber loot and you let it go!!

I was cacking my head off at work. People were looking at me as though I'm
crazy.

However,  before out cat learnt not to overindulge in dried cat food and
then drink lots, a lot of my LDON pals were so used to me saying "AFK - Cat
Throwing up" that whenever I had to afk for any other reason, I'd get four
comments saying "Cat throwing up?"  I'm sure they thought it was a ruse!!
