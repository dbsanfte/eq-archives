When a vendor says he's "busy", or "I'm not open for business right now",
or "can't you see I'm doing something?", it means that he is "out of place"
(i.e., not standing in his usual spot).

Either someone attacked him and the vendor ran after the attacker, or
someone KoS to the vendor wandered by and the vendor chased him.
Rarely, a vendor will be programmed to "go on a walk" away from their
usual spot (e.g. Altunic Jartin in EC), and they'll also be unavailable
for business while they're away from their "store" location.

This can be very annoying when you really need to do business with
that vendor.

One thing that sometimes helps to get them to move back into
proper position is to attack the vendor then run like
hell for the zone line (vendors often hit harder than guards, be
careful).  After the vendor has chased you and then you've zoned,
they'll often get motivated to walk back to their proper position
(the farther away from their usual spot they are, the more likely
they are to get their butt in gear and go back "home").

If you're low enough level that this could be very dangerous, explain
the situation in /ooc and ask a high-level person to do the honors.
