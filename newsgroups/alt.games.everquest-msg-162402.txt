A friend of mine gets this.  He has replaced his entire computer a piece 
at a time, and is still having the problem.

I would really like to see more posts from people who managed to fix 
this somehow.  It sounds like different fixes work for different people. 
    I have heard that for one person replacing the sound card fixed it, 
for another fiddling with EQ settings fixed it, but for most people 
there is no fix.

One guy bought a brand new computer because his old one was having this 
problem, but the new machine has the problem too, and he still can't play!
