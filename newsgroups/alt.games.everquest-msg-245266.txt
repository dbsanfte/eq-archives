I think thats probably a good reasoning for some of it.. sortof a
"traditional" guild, where monks exist, and do the pulling by default :)

Assuming haste, brain cells etc were all on a par.. :)
Thats pretty sad.

I know at the lower game equal weapons may not be as readily available (e.g
the best droppable weapon for each class/type doesn't necesarily balance
out).. wheras in a higher raiding guild, its pretty much the norm that all
classes have (or are realistically waiting on) their dream weapons.  These
weapons do seem more balanced against each other.. which I guess is obvious,
seens as they are both number "1".. wheras the best droppables would be
numbers 5 and 15 for the class!

I know that when I do Ldons with "random_people", I will always outdamage
all the melees in the group (refering to guilds clearly below me, or not
guilded.. not including similar potime people).. this includes rogues too,
by a good margin. (with less than elemental pokers).  Yes, im fully aware
that the only reason I outdamage some of them is because my weapons, attack,
mods etc are far superioir... but the point is, things like this can create
"blips" at lower levels too, and far easier/more common

We have a 65 beserker, mostly in "noob" gear, but with a plane of time
weapon (I haven't done any zerker research, but the weapon is the best 2hand
knight weapon in the game atm).. so i figure his DPS will be pretty close to
his maximum potential.  I did an ikkinz trial with him recently (a
quick/small expedition, with a named mob that everybody knows must be burned
down asap.. so parsing is a decent indication here)

When i get a bit of time (busy busy this week!) I will try and dig the
logfile out.. (I *think* I parsed the fight)

Results :)

Well.. should they?
Both are offensive classes, but 1 is pure melee and 1 is a caster... and
thats a whole new can of worms for balance issues..

I know a mage can reach my DPS without attaining my level of gear.. I still
group with melees over casters, though!  Its too easy to afk and harder to
detect as a caster than a melee !

But is it really better to deal with so many at once? I dunno.. i mean maybe
for your group makeup it is.
I know that when I exp in lower tiers, PoV or Tactics, whilst I can handle a
3 mob pull/train without major risk of death.. i just don't find it
efficient to do so.  In ldons its a bit different.. but the focus isnt on
efficiency there (for a 4 hour exp grind etc).. so wasting extra mana is a
welcome tradeoff for faster adventure points.

Start with a MM or Ruj mission.  These are pretty spaced out (compared to
some 6-7 mob rooms in other missions on regular occurance..)

Well.. I don't "normally" have a plate class in my group. I don't do the LFG
thing anymore, and the core of my group is always monk/shaman/cleric.  I
have a r/l & best online friends channel, whom I will group with (and often
do).. but if nobody is free, well its just the 2(3) of us.  Some of it *is*
tough as shit for me to tank, or tough for us to duo.. so yeah, Id say its
stuff that "normal" people would use a plate class for.  A lot of it isnt
very efficient for me to tank, but its the norm and my cleric will always
keep me up versus "difficult but not impossible" mobs.  And whilst im pretty
anal about group efficiency.. I guess an inefficient tank + good dps beats
twiddling my thumbs and waiting for a tank.

Yes I have tanked hard LDons. I've tanked about 10 I guess (out of 20 or so
hard ldons that ive attended).. Monk/Cleric/Shaman struggles a bit for DPS
though in ldon hards (I also dont find hard ldons fun).  Its not a regular
occurance though - I tank in places where the 3 of us can work fine. If some
friends come to join me, then fine. If not, its cool.. the 2(3) of us will
just keep plugging away.  Hard ldons are places id want to delay and get
some proper dps for before i begin.. and if im doing that, I may as well
delay and get a proper tank too.  So i just don't!

Ya he agro kites.  I don't know if the exp is particularly fantastic, but it
sure beats my inability to solo shit in god :) He also got this little
trinket on his second day on the server (he only got the flag a day or so
before moving)

Bard melee is very low.. average of maybe 100 dps in the highend (dps
classes are doing upwards of 300 dps at this stage).. of course they can add
like 10% dps to everybody else in the group

I don't think hes pulling, unless you have an equally skilled mezzer in the
group too :) But I still stand by my comment, paladin heals are a lot more
than insignificant "mana savers".. heck, often they are raid savers :)  But
of course it depends where you play.. if you are dealing with big nasty
AE's, you will see how invaluable they are.

Well PoK book was going to "ruin" their business, right?  the same class who
friggin whined and whined about always being begged to port, before there
were any alternatives.

It may not be the only way to travel now.. PoK books and selos dino are a
useful alternate method.. but nothing beats the speed and ease of porting
still.

Yes. But only to prove you wrong :)
