Yup, been there, felt that. Solo is an option, even without KEI, but...

At level 1 you got one of the most useful group spells for low level. Snare!
I'll bet you those 1000 HP tanks just hate chasing around that "almost ready
to die" MOB. At 14 you really have a whole kit of useful spells for
grouping.

Use Skin like Rock on everyone.
Shield of Thistles your main tank, and anyone else that tends to grab agro.
(everytime you see the message that MOBx was hit by thorns for 6 damage,
that's damage you did)
Stinging Swarm the mob as soon as it's in range (set up an /assist hot key.
it helps)
Snare when it's about half dead. (if resisted, keep snareing until it
sticks)
If mana allows hit the MOB with Ignite a few times.

If it's a long fight, give your tank a "Zing" (Invigor)

When in a group, do not root, snare is much better. Root is for solo.
And any healing is better than none when your tanks health is dropping
faster than the MOBs.

Later in life when you get your evac spells you will have the opportunity to
save your group from a total wipe out, like I did last night in Velks when
we pulled the named in Upper Dogs :)

As a Druid you will still be under appreciated, but never useless.
