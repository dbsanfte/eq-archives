Cast an LFG spell, and take a pet^H^H^H tank with you.....I've taken one
on with my ranger at 46 and losing my buffs was a right pain - I could hit
it with root and snare and swarms all day (and Im not sure it wasnt
dispelling them) but in the ned it could close it could do fair amounts of
damage (and Im over 1000hp with an AC approaching 900 IIRC) to the extent
I decided to flee for the zone (and boy did I need a quick SoW at that
point).
