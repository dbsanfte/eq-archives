hehe...You know, I really don't understand all the whining and crying over X
is better than Y, nerf it.  If you really feel that your character (whatever
it is) is so bad, play something else.  I've played about everything but a
Mage and a Wizard, I don't cry because my Druid can't heal like a Cleric, or
because a Druid doesn't have a pet like a Beastlord, or because Rangers
can't Tank like Warriors etc etc etc.  If someone is truly unhappy playing
one thing, play something else rather than try to change others to your
benefit.
