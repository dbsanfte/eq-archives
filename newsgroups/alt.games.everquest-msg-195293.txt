 It's random like procs tend to be. Sometimes I get it to go off on the
first swing before it even hits a mob and sometimes it takes 50 swings.
If you're using it on level 2 mobs though it usually takes awhile.

 I am KoS in the outpost and I use it all the time. Being a monk I have
sneak and feign death which helps. Without that I'd have to swim wide
around the docks to get out. If you turn around and jump out of the boat
and run to the south wall (SW really) you'll normally only have the one
green skelton worker aggro.
