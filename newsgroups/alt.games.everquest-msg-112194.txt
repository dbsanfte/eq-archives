He's vindicated by 2 letters, JK (Just Kidding)
It was a joke as the poster was having problems WHEN he moved about.

No, not as such but I swear there is a positition that when a mob turns his
back on you he increases his AC.
This is probably just chance but the amount of times a mob has turned to
flee but remained put due to snare (and low health) he is nearly unhittable
from his left rear quarter, if I move directly  behind, in front or other
side, no problem, just there...odd but it prolly is just chance and my
imagination.
The random number generator is not truly random (it never can be) so a run
of misses can seem to be broken by turning attack off/on again of course
who's to say that the run of misses would not have ben broken anyway.
You can't move about to make a mob miss but if you are not close enough you
will not be able to disarm and even taunt but still hit and be hit.
I did hear once that someone managed to get behind a mob and backstab while
in 1on1 melee.
