I don;t like it.  When I think of a bazaar what comes to mind is a
bunch of tents and stalls outdoors.  Of course the old bazaar wasn't
outdoors but it had more of an outdoor feel than the new one by a long
shot.

And having to go from the vendor in the diamond room of the blue
griffin room to the vendor in the sapphire room of the red dragon
room.....well that just blows sheep.
