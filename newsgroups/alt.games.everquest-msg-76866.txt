Nope - Coldain Velium can be bought in Thurgadin and probably drops from
the Coldain dwarves in Velious, though I am on Thurgadin faction, thus not
killing dwarves and cannot tell.

In Thurgadin, all the Coldain Velium can be bought for 60 up to 80 plat,
depending
on faction, charisma and specific weapon.

I was told those are the only Velium Weapons that have their effect proc at
level one, so they are quite useful for twinking.
