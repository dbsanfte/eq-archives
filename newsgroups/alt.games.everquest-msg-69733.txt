You shouldn't have any problems in Freeport, unless you're a Dark Elf, Ogre,
Troll or Iksar. If they put up with me, a Human Necromancer, when I had no
faction work done, they'll put up with anyone...as long as they don't belong to
one of the races listed above.

(But I'd suggest taking a Vah Shir Beastlord to Halas, since there's a BL guild
there)
