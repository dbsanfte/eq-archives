Actually, it's 3AM for them when they patch. This is done to minimize
downtime to the largest percentage of their customers, not because it's
when they start work. If you play in off hours, you're just SoL. 

They tried changing patch times to daylight working hours for themselves
2 or 3 months after release. It lasted 2 or 3 patches before they went
back to 3am pst so I imagine they determined it cost them more in
customer service calls asking why the server was down than it saved in
overtime for doing it at 3am. Assuming they pay the patch people
overtime that is.
