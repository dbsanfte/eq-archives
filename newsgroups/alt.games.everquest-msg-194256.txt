A guy in a friendly guild said they had an Ally mage and Rogue now, so I 
asked him if non-KOS was good enough and he said no.  When I asked him why, 
he said something about the Royals would aggro you for some odd reason.  I 
wouldn't put it past Sony to try to nerf bypassing content by having all 
the sarnaks within an X foot radius aggro when a non-Ally CoH is performed 
or something as silly.

Made no sense to me, and I'm mighty glad he was wrong, based on other 
peoples' posts.

I've fought to the Overking 2 times, and we're prepared to do it again if 
we have to.  Avoiding the crap on the way in is nice when you don't have a 
clicker, a Necro over 43, or a lot of money for coffins in the first place.

It's gonna be fun.
