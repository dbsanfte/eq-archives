This makes me curious.  I wonder what determines whether or not a game will
have a lot of role playing?  I've only played two MMORPGs (EQ and DAoC), and
in those two, the EQ role playing server is one of the least popular, while
the DAoC role playing servers are near the top.  Anyone here play AC or AC2
or AO or any other MMORPG?  How is role playing in those games?

My guess is that it has to do with familiarity of the story or setting of
the game.  EQ has a vast story...but it is all unfamiliar.  DAoC's story is
based on real myth and legend, so people go in being at least somewhat
familiar with it.

My prediction is that if SWG has a role playing server, it will be very
popular.
