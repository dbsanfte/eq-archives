They don't pay 50-100pp for it. I'm betting they don't pay *anything* for
it, or they donate a stack of foraged vegetables, or something trivial.
There's people giving away KEI for FREE! Donations appreciated but not
required. That means you can just go up there, hail some enchanter for an
invite, get KEI, and zip back to the whiskered bats in North Qeynos.

Rather than hearing what your level 62 wizard (or whatever) donates for
KEI and assuming that level 1 newbs would pay equally, it would be
interesting to hear from some high level enchanters what the breakdown is
for what people pay.
