Well, some classes can solo all their way to lvl 60, but only if you know
what you're doing. For other classes it starts paying off to group starting
level 12 or so (lower if you like people around, I usually start around lvl
8 or so).

This is a common problem and you'll get frustrated many times. Deal with it,
is my opinion :-/
If you're traveling it's useful to make a hotkey with "/loc" as one line in
it. It will give you your location on that map and you can always find it
again. You might want to print some maps from www.eqatlas.com and
www.eqmaps.com as well.

F10 switches between "window", "transparent full screen" and "full screen".
F9 switches between camera modes.
You can change resolution in the display tab of the options menu in the
game.

I heard newer versions of the game don't come equiped with the tutorial
anymore. I never used it myself but I read it was a useful introduction.
Anyway, you never could set things offline except via the .ini files in your
EQ directory.

As a side note for creation guides, check eq.castersrealm.com for good
character creation guides and helpful hints for your character. It helps if
you know what to enhance and what's completely useless to you.
