Careful.  I believe one of the ways people use nowadays to transfer plat
that is purchased for RL money is to do it via outrageous prices on items.
E.g., I sell you 100k plat for RL money, and you tell me the char you want me
to deliver to, and then you leave that char up in the Bazaar with some cheap
item (fishing grubs would work) for sale for 100k.  Saves having to arrange
an actual meeting.

People who see your expensive fishing grubs might think you are awaiting a
delivery of plat!  The could hurt your reputation with some people.
