I would agree with Lief on this. Enchanter is one of those classes that 
are relied upon to keep groups alive. I would be wary of skipping 
through the first 2 dozen levels and arriving at a point where your 
friend was in a group who required their crowd-control skills only to 
find that they were not sure of 
(a) what they need to do and 
(b) what they need to instruct their group to do. 

Many people at lower levels have little idea of how to play in a group
with an Enchanter and breaking mezzes (especially with DOTs) often 
results in death.

Besides which, if you are new to EQ you should take time to stop and
smell the flowers :)

My suggestion would be to start a new character at the same time and
work up through the levels together. My wife has a Beastlord and we find
that Beastlord & Enchanter is an awesome combination.

However you tackle it, I just hope you and they enjoy the game :)
