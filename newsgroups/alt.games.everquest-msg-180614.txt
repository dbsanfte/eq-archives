Personally, in my opinion, I wouldnt want that. I get enough
advertising shoved in my face on a constant basis. I dont want it in
my entertainment. Ill pay a monthly fee to not have it thank you. It
seems that whenever advertising finds a new venue, it doesnt take long
for them to exploit it as much as they can. For example, now, you have
to sit through 15 mins of ads when you PAY for a frickin movie at the
theater. Soon, it would NOT suprise me to see ads in the middle of the
damn movie. I could rant on and go into an advertising flame... but...
im gonna go sip my coffee and wake up...
