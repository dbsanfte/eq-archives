How mugh did you fork out for that robe? You have to be a nice change
from all the CCS human druids, that's for sure :)

I had an alt pottering around EC last night reading auctions, looking
for GE boots. All I saw were others wanting to buy the boots, and
someone selling coldain skin boots I couldn't afford. Got killed by
all of Orc 2 (I'd whacked one of them as I ran by, a minute later they
had finished wiping out the orc 2 group and came after me :) ), got
killed by a lion just as I was looting corpse. The dual CRs kept me
online later than intended and as I was about to log, someone
auctioned a shroud of nature for 3 k. I am back to not being able to
afford GE boots, but I can finally get rid of my foreman's tunic!

As for shields, I guess the sarnak battle shield would be neat with
your druid look; I want a ry'gorr shield for mine. (Hey, it's black!)
