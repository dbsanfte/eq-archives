The thing that bothers me about all the nodrop is usually one of my
characters needs an item, and its a different character that gets it
as a drop. But since its nodrop, cannot put it in the shared bank
slots and get it to the character that needs it.

Thats why I think items needed for newbie armor quests shouldn't be
nodrop.
