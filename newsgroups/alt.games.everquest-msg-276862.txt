Yeah, my wife and I just don't go into Kith after dark.  If we want to
get to Highhold/pass, and it's after sunset, we either take the longer
Karana's rout, or just wait for sunrise in West Commons. Even at 43,
that place is still disconcerting. Nevermind my poor little 16 chanter,
who must travel through there to get his latest pet.
