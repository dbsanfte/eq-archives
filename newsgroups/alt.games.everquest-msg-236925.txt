You have no inner voice?  A voice that wishes for better events in
your life?  A voice that wishes a friend was not hurt?  A voice that
hopes a loved one comes back from a perilous adventure (i.e. loved one
in the military on combat assignment)

no, I belive the Deity form allows you to make that choice... to
choose to believe, or choose to be the common smartass...

Nope we dont... man knows everything...  except the Unknown... that is
where the faith and belief systems come in.  In case you havent
noticed, religion has evolved.  Back in time the Deity figures
represented Nature.  Sun, Moon, Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Thunder
Storms, Earth Quake... etc.  As our knowledge has evolved so has our
religion. (our religon as a species not one specific religion)
