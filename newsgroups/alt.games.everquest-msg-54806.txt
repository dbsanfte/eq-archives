So, I work my ass off leveling up my character only to find that the higher
I get, the more wacked the con's are in the game.  I con a giant or drolvarg
in DL and it's green to me.  I can take it down, but it takes everything
I've got to do it - all my mana and most of my health, but I get no
experience for it.  Do the same with a blue and if I can take it (only with
a bit of help) I'll get XP, but by myself it'll take me down as fast as I
can take it down - and near the end of a battle the mobs always get tougher,
so I get my ass kicked.
I started noticing these mis-cons back in my 30's, but now I'm 51 and most
everything that can give me xp I can't fight and some things that I'm led to
believe should be easy (judging by the con) can kick my ass!  WTF is up with
this???
And I'm not even talking about apparent intentional under-con's like Kizdean
Gix...
