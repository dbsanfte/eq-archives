  Not true. Diable II: Lords of Destruction. :) Well, perhaps, 
not exactly the same, but hey, upgrade to a massively multiplayer 
game (with many, many more folks playing than EQ, and on a 
free service, no less).

  Ah, you see, though, that isn't my job to do it. It IS Verant's job. :) 
This is a classic non-argument. It's like going to a Burger King, 
and asking for a burger with cheese and getting one without cheese. 
It is my responsibility to "shut up" and do it myself? No, it is 
their job to deliver what they promised after taking my money. 
Plain and simple.

  Well, my opinion is that they should have just considered this 
a new game: since it also changes the requirements for the 
other parts of the game (i.e. you can no longer play EQ 
with the same requirements as before). They should have 
done this as EQ2, allowing folks with lesser systems the 
CHOICE to upgrade, rather than a directive. 


>Remember the size of this undertaking and show a little patience.  

  If I had done the same thing at work, I'd be fired. 
"Sorry, sir, I know you've paid for this already, and 
that you have been paying for it for a while, and I 
know that I said it would be ready by tomorrow, but, hey, 
have some patience. It'll work. Eventually." Hmmm, maybe 
I'll try that this week. 


>Please remember it is supposed to be a game.  If it causes you this much
>distress maybe it is not the right game for you.

  Well, this I do agree with. However, realize that this is also 
affecting people who were playing the game perfectly fine before 
SoL, and who don't even care about the improvements, necessarily. 

   Anyhow, enough bitching about the bitching about the bitching. :) 
Time to play more Camelot. :)
