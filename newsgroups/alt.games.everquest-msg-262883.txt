Well, I have my main at 250 jeweler, with the eyeglass, so I can 
do the first treatment on my new citrine augment <happy dance> 
and as I have a lower level rogue who already started doing 
poisonmaking, it is sensible to bring her skills up to 250 as 
well, so I can finish augmenting the augment [hm, sounds very 
redundant put that way=)] and I dont mind camping *or* 
tradeskills because sometimes just talking with friends is fine, 
and several of them are in different guilds so we have our own 
chat channel to natter in while doing different things. FWIW, I 
could stand in bazaar and sell while doing combines if I really 
want...I am not in EQ to grind out levels, and being able to do 
my own combines on stuff I rip out of the rotting carcass of my 
prey gives me a sense of accompliahment. Count me in, by the way, 
as someone who would detest seeing someone able to *buy* their 
epic. Now *that* would really kill EQ for me!

then what did you mean when you said the bit about robbing a 
newbie of memories? I took it to mean that I was taking their ice 
giant camping memories away from them...

Actually, I have a number of friends that lived in connecticut 
who had to move out of state because they couldnt get decent jobs 
here...unfortunately the cost of living here sucks that you cant 
even manage to share a flat with a roommate on a typical 
mall/fastfood minimum wage job here=\ Even my normal source of 
work [temp agencies] has dried up. I have the licensing for 
insurance provider which let them place me in insurance agencys 
while other employees went on vacation, but even those jobs, and 
paralegal temp jobs have dried up=\ *sigh* I would love to win 
the lottery, i hear it is up to something on the order of 200 
million$...but i would need to actually put a crowbar into the 
wallet and buy tickets=)
