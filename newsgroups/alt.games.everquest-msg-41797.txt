Go to the warrens and stonebrunt mountians.  Carefull, your religion will
make you kos in paniel, you will have to kill about 50-100 kolbolds in tox
to get threw.

The loot and money is better then Lake of Ill Omen, plus you dont have to
walk past the nasty spiders

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I
advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives
boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the
ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no
character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of
your walks."
--Thomas Jefferson
