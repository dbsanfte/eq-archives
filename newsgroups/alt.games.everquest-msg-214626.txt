Actually, according to Lucy, Word of Replenishment _does_ knock
7 off the Curse Counter.  Of course, it also knocks 14 off the
Disease and Poison counters (and heals 2500hp to boot).  Looking
at Plague Mites, Lucy shows it has an "unknown calc" add to the
Disease counter, so as you found Remove Curse won't help.

Oh, and Tracey, Cure Disease only decrememnts Disease counter by
1 (one), so if it took 3 casts of Word of Replenishment to fix
Plague Mites it would take a minimum of 29 casts of Cure Disease
(max 42) to remove that particular instance of it (the damage it
does varies by casting level, so it seems very possible that the
amount of curing required varies with the level of the effect as
well).  Apparently you just ran out of patience too soon.  ;)
