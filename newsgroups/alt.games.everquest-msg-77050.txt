It's cheaper than jewelcrafting to get to a level you can make a profit at.
You only have to get your Alchemy up into the 40s or so to make a profit off
sow potions.  After that, spend some of your profits on getting it higher.
At 83 (I think), I fail on making sow potions about 1 in 40 times.  So 4 10
charge potions cost me 226pp (about).  I sell them for 360pp to 400pp, that
gives me a profit of 134pp to 174pp.  I don't just sit around hawking them,
but I try to always keep a stock of them on hand, and auction when I think
about it, or send a tell when someone auctions to buy.  I probably average
selling 1 or 2 per play session.  If I decided to seriously raise cash, I
could probably make up a bunch, and just spend a few days wandering from
zone to zone hawking them.  Plus, in addition to SoW potions, you can make
DS potions, a bit expensive to make, but I try to always keep a few on me to
hand out to tanks I group with in order to help things along.  Then there
are Invis to Undead potions, and Shrink potions.  The shrink is handy, as
you can use it outdoors, allowing you to fit into small spaces, and through
small doors.
