I'm not sure I believe Kaev either, but your example doesn't
counter his claim.  It might have been that you were doing
less actual damage with the 2HB (due to lower skill -- shame
on you for neglecting it :-) and hence less aggro, or it could
have been that the 2HB was slower (if nothing else, it's a
single attack vs the dual wield's two attacks, and I suspect
the 2HB has larger delay as well) and therefore you were doing
fewer attacks and getting less aggro.

Kaev didn't say that the "potential damage" was completely
counted toward aggro, just that it affects aggro "in some way".
I do admit that it's clear that a miss must generate *some*
aggro, since the initial pull can be done with a miss.  (Given
the cap on monk's Throwing skill, I often missed when pulling,
until I learned about the Throw Stone disc.)

I've started reading the Steel Warriors site; thanks to the
earlier poster for the link!  Interesting stuff; I liked the
thread analysing how many successful Taunts are needed to
overcome the "hate bonus" for "first aggro".
