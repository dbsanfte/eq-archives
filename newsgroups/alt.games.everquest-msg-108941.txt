There was a lot of discussion of this subject in
the early days of UO. Whether a RL persona could
be absolutely divorced from their RP persona.

Personally, I don't think it can. 

I believed, at the time, that people who were
jerks in the game were probably jerks in RL,
although in the face of a few anecdotes about some
players who were nasty gits in the game, but nice
as pie in real life, I have changed to thinking,
that maybe, there are some players who are capable
of acting that way.

Probably the same ratio as good actors to the
general population.
