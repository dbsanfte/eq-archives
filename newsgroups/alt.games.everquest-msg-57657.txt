Well as a mage I am totally dependant on my pet and keep an eye on it at all
times. I usually don't lose my pet, but sometimes it does odd things because
of pathing (or lack thereof). My summon companion spell helps a lot and so
does my inst-cast invis vs animals boots. Pet gone in dungeon? invis up, pet
down. Less chance for trains :)

Mostly the "/guard here" works wonders though. I've seen a pet go through
very complex tunneling to get back to his guard spot, tunneling I usually
lose him when he follows me :-/
