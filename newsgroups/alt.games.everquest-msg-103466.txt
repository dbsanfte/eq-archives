This reminds me of (yet another) incident in DL. Maybe im a bit
intolerant... I'd be interested in what others would do under these
circumstances....

In a party of 4, xp is clicking away, and a barb warrior (need  I say more)
join the party and starts sending group says in some language ive never
seen. I figure he doesnt realize, so I send out a group say "Use common". I
get a group say back "If i were talking to you, id use common". Then
proceeds to continue sending group says in abother language. I just got
pissed, joined another (much better) party and put him on ignore. His reply
pissed me more than the messages.
