    Naw, I still think that Breathe should have followed my suggestion when he
mentioned the situation in age chat.  I told him to go to his server's forum
board and complain bitterly about the whole affair, naming name and of course
the name of the guild.  Ok, his way was probably more mature and less traumatic
for all involved, but mine was more, well, funny.  To me, that is.

   Houston, we have a drama.
