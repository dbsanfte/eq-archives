Level 11 may be a bit high for this now but I found the Crushbone Belt quest
is a good one for levelling quite quickly.  Collect them and give them to
Canloe Nasbuk (or something like that) in the Kaladim war guild.

Get a good Throne Room group going in Crushbone, that's always good exp plus
you can usually pick up a DRT to wear or sell.  Then at 16 on to Oasis and
what Drathor said.  At level 30 i found High Keep WR is good for getting you
through hell and loot isn't too bad.

Of cousre dying less is also a good way of levelling more quickly ).  Also
remember, it's not how fast you level - it's the journey you take, take time
to enjoy yourself - smell the roses ).  I have just turned 31 and often go
home to Greater Fardark to visit, help newbies and meet people's new alts.

Take care,


Lex
