slow...

Really, since "farming out" pulling and/or making it less required, in
conjunction with basically removing tanking ability, monks have lost any
semblance of a "role" in groups, and I haven't seen any suggestions that
are A) likely to happen and B) give monks a definite role in groups.  Which
leaves us as rogue-light (somewhat misleading, since rogues out-damage *and*
out-tank monks these days...  more like rogue-light-light).

On raids monk-pulling is still pretty useful.  In groups, I still pull but
I'm fully aware that half the people in the group could do it just as well.
