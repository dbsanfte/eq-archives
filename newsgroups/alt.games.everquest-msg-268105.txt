Wheew, I'm using an Athlon XP 1700+ but also have 1 gig.  The new system 
will only have 512 for the time being.  Goodness, I hope it doesn't 
choke on that.  I know there's a bug with the game right now, at least 
for my system.  Seems to crash about every 2 hours.  I managed to catch 
the memory footprint and it's around 520 megs.  The crash seems to occur 
mostly just as the game is loading me into a new zone.  I get to hear 
the sounds and then poof, game gone.  Haven't updated my sound drivers 
so I might try that next. /shrug

So to keep in the context of the thread here, it appears that haveing a 
slow system with 1 gig should get you by but having only 512 might get 
you more lagtime then playtime.
