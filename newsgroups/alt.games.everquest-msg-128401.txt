Shouldn't be very hard to find out.  Just pick a specific monster type and
fight it once with a low delay weapon, then once with a high delay weapon.
Immediately before and after the fight, do the /time command.  After the
fight, scroll all the way up and count how many swings the monster attempted
(or sets of swings in case of monsters who can do multiple attacks), without
regard to whether they hit or missed.  Divide the total amount of time the
fight took in seconds by the number of attacks the monster attempted to get
a decent estimate of its effective weapon delay in seconds.  Compare your
results to see if your weapon made a difference.  Repeat several times to
make sure your results are consistent.

My best friend plays a paladin.  He uses a jagged blade of mourning, but
also owns an argent defender.  I think I might get him to do this experiment
with those swords too.  Except the jagged blade procs a stun, which would
make the calculations a bit more difficult should it proc during the test
fight.
