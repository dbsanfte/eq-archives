MoSS is/was common as dirt and thus cheap as dirt, and usable at L1.

That weapon is far from really nice, and 18/40 2hs that weighs 13.0
is totally outclassed by the BABS (24/39), which is very common and
very cheap, and unless they've changed the quest from when the weapon
was decent (3+ years ago) it's far from trivial for a low level.

SSoL is very weak by today's standards.

The Pine Scout sword, whatever it's called, is a far better weapon than
the Jagged Pine Crook, which was crap back when the game was new (a
heavy, primary only, 5/30 1hb that requires multiple uncommon drops off
an uncommon mob, everybody I ever mnew who did the quest was very
disappointed).

Bullshit.  The BABS (Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword) is Ranger usable
and drops off high 20s mobs in Runnyeye.  It's a much better weapon
than the Deepwater Harpoon (finally remembered the name, long ago it
was my first good two-hander, now it's junk), and you can likely
buy it in bazaar for 20 to 50 pp.

On Stromm lots of Warriors in their 30s were using the WotFS, claiming
the proc was a nice agro magnet.  You're hunting the SSoY under level
30? in what universe?

/aside
moot = arguable, used by previous poster in the sense that the
argument is pointless and cannot be empiricly resolved
mute = silent/speechless

Hmmmm, it might work if you use your spells to generate agro, but why
play an ersatz knight?  If you want to fight sword and shield it would
make a lot more sense to play a Paladin or Shadowknight, who get higher
ratio 1-handers to compensate for their lack of dual wield skill and
lower ATK (post 40).  The Ranger class isn't designed for tanking as a
primary function, the Warrior and knights are, and that design carries
over into the itemization of the game.  Deal with it.  Just as the
knights will have to deal with their offensive inadequacies.  Not all
classes are created identical.
