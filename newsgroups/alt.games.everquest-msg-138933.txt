The original poster has a 1.8ghz CPU with 512mb of DDR memory. He is
running a video card that is 4 generations old.
(TNT2--GeForce--GeForce2--GeForce3--GeForce4) Believe me when I say
that his video card IS a bottleneck in his system. In any game he
plays his CPU will be twiddling it's thumbs waiting for the video card
to catch up.

>I've got a nice system with a GeForce4 Ti4600 and it still lags a lot in the bazaar.

The Bazaar is a special problem. It is a massively high polygon count
zone that will drag most systems to thier knees even when the zone is
empty. It has got to be one of the top 5 WORST zones for video lag in
EQ. With the release of the new "/bazaar" trader code we now have
300-500 players jamming into the zone making it a real nightmare.
