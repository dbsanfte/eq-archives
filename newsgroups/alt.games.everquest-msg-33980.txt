Well it certainly wasn't meant that way.  I was 'bitchy' only to the 
person who suggested that stealing camps was justified because he didn't 
get there first, and bitchy because I'd spent a whole day with a low 
level character dying over and over because people kept interfering.  
Bah.  Anyway.  My newsreader is messing up, and I don't have the energy 
to MAKE it quote everything right now, so.. yes.  Oh, and my "go 
elsewhere" was based on the fact that I've heard lots of high levels 
discussing how the crowding is *not* an issue any longer and there *are* 
many other places to go.  So... *shrug*
