Yup.  So, in most cases, you want 0% AA till 65, then 100% AA.  If there are
any AA that you do want before 65, you should be at 100% AA while going for
them, then 0% AA till 65.

Basically, at any given combination of total AA XP and total regular XP, a
person who always has the split at 0% or 100%, and only changes the split at
AA or regular dings, could have got to that point with all but the latest
ding having occured earlier, and the latest ding at the same time or earlier
(depending on whether or not any of the AA points or levels represented
points at which they start earning XP faster).
