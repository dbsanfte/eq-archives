Just curious.

Tonight on AB there was a lvl 1 char (Aildyil) in the Bazaar that started
spamming the shout channel with profanities about players and GMs in
general.
I logged to the server chat to try and find out what was going on (there was
a GM online but wasnt sure what he was up to as he was in the bazaar for
some time while this was going on). I read that EXACTLY the same thing was
happening on the FV server. I logged back and 2 GMs eventually got rid of
him.
I again logged to the server chat to find the the problem was also happening
on Quellious.

VERY strange. At least 3 servers having the same problem at the same time.
Anyone else experience it? Should SoE (or we for that matter) be worried
about this?
