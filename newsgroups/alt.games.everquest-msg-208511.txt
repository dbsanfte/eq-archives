The value was significantly reduced when they made it possible for 
everyone to actually see at least a bit in the dark.  When I made my 
first run from Everfrost through Blackburrow, it was just about 
impossible even with a torch.  Now, you can do it with no light source.  
Heck, I remember when just going from Everfrost to Halas was a pain in 
the butt.
