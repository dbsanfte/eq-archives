EQ1 did the same sort of thing and I don't remember anyone complaining 
about it much; you want to sell things, you leave your character online 
holding them.

You don't have to be "Playing", in fact its mostly better not to, you 
just leave the computer hooked up with the game on overnight, or during 
the day while you're at school/work.

Used to be, in the dark days before the bazaar, that you did have to be 
"playing" to sell things, as there was no automated way to do it; we 
used to sit around in the East Commonlands tunnel hitting an auction 
hotkey with a list of our items every now and then.

I'm enough of an oldtimer to remember those days, but I'm not going to 
give you the old "uphill both ways, and we Liked It That Way" speech; 
the bazaar was a hundred times better for the majority of people, who 
don't really enjoy haggling all that much.

I don't really see how being able to go into vendor mode offline would 
hurt all that much, as implemented in EQ2, but in EQ1 I can think of a 
problem; the bazaar zone was the only place you could do this, and it 
was always very crowded with vendors and people shopping, in fact on 
some servers they got up to their imposed limit on how many people could 
be in vendor mode at any one time, so new vendors weren't allowed till 
someone dropped out.  Even with this limit in place, it was usually the 
laggiest zone in the game, which is to say, the most crowded.  If you 
could be in vendor mode without being on line you'd see ten times as 
many vendors... heck, I'd still have a character in vendor mode even 
though I quit the game months ago; I'd have put my stuff to sell on him 
and left him in vendor mode in case I ever come back.

Since vendors aren't all crowded into one EQ2 zone (and since they could 
just instance the bazaar zone if there was one) I don't see how the same 
can be said of EQ2; does anyone who -is- playing EQ2 know of a similar 
crowding issue that might develop?  Say, that the mechanism to hunt for 
vendors can become overcrowded?
