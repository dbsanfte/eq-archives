Nope. Its no different than one player paying ('bribing') another to 
fail to show/deliberately miss the net/whatever. Sure the action that 
takes place on the field is 'legal'; just because the cash part of the 
transaction takes place off the field the team manager and/or league 
management is still well within rights impose sanctions against the 
players involved.

It really doesn't matter where its done. If any part of it is done while 
'playing' eq then its affecting play of the game, and you can be sanctioned.

Consider WotCs MtGO product ... imagine if someone started selling 
tourament rankings, by taking a payment and then selectively buying off 
opponents and getting them to lose against you. Clearly that is against 
the rules... despite the fact that no money changes hands within a mile 
of WotCs facilities. Yet, if that were to be detected WotC would 
disqualify and likely ban the person who purchased the ranking, and 
probably sanction anyone who took money too. But what about the 'broker' 
this guy might never have even logged into MtGO at all ever. They're 
would be nothing 'in-game' they could do to him... they'd have to pursue 
him for damages in the courts... and that might be difficult... so 
they'd probably just stick to hanging any players they catch out to dry.

You are extremely naive if you think that simply because the money 
changed hands while you were on your butt in your rec-room that you are 
somehow exempt from the rules of a game.
