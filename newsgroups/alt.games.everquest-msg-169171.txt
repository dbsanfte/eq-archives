Every server is different.  If rotations are working on yours, great!

Povar used to have a reservation system.  People would post their intention
to do X plane on Y date, and other people respected it.

The system broke down when there were so many people capable of hitting the
planes that the next opening was three or four MONTHS away.  Finally, one of
the larger guilds said "screw this, it's all FCFS as far as we're
concerned".  There was much moaning and gnashing of teeth, but people
adjusted.

Besides, Hate and Fear just aren't all that contested anymore.  You can
pretty much go up any time you want now, and chances are nobody else will be
there.

There are some rotations on the high-end stuff, but that's only because
they're small enough that people don't have to wait long before their turn
comes up again.  I would expect it to break down if someone had to wait
three months for a chance at NToV, for example.
