Most tradeskill merchants sell books/scrolls with the basic and some
advanced recipes.
Then some recipes are given by quest NPCs, some are dropped my
mobs. And yet some others have been discovered by experimenting.

Reduces damage and makes it harder to get hit.

This is a tougher one - especially since even if you wanted to,
you couldn't put skillpoints in most skills beyond a basic
level (about 20 mostly).
Solution - group with a druid/chanter/necro and fear kite mobs,
so you can stick blows without eating hits.
