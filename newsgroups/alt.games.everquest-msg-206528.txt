Hmm was the Halloween event in Rathe, WC and SRo in 2001 or 2002?
Sometimes a royal rumble or Best <insert class> arena event which are pretty
lame.
When was the LoY opening? Although it was sort of scripted there were GM's
around on some servers to make it even more interesting.
When was all the fuss with the DE camps in WC nearing Freeport? Did it ever
come to a battle? (I was on vacation for a while at that time).

Talked to GM's just to insert some lore (last one was about gypsies for some
reason, think there was an event connected to it but nobody could figure out
what and most GM's are on at US times so I need to log too soon for my
taste).

Haven't seen much this year though. Ever since they implemented
rotation-GM's it got all screwed up.

The "real" gm events with gods appearing and fighting / talking to other
gods more or less got f*cked by players every time so I think they gave
those up.It was briliant when there were zone wide DT's for offenders once
though. Wasn't there but heard about it, entire guilds got smeared for
trying to attack on the principle of "she can't nuke us all before we take
her down". Guess again :P.
