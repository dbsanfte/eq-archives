It depends on the providers in your area I imagine. My overall opinion 
is that most cable services are faster and cheaper (compared to their 
speed) yet less reliable for gaming and consistancy.

I've been on my DSL for about 3 or 4 years and have always gotten my top 
speeds of about 67K/sec downstream (30K/sec upstream). I pay about 
$60/month for that. It's never fluctuated, no "peak hours" to avoid, no 
hassles.

At the same time some of my friends had gotten @home cable for only 
$40/month and could download at 500KB/sec. Additionally, their ping 
times in games were not really any different than my ping times. When 
@home went out AT&T took over and downloads on cable went to about 
170-220KB/sec and prices went to about $50/month. Still much faster than 
my connection and still cheaper. Ping times remained well off. Over 
time, however, pings became increasingly worse for not just my local 
friends on AT&T cable but for many people I play games with up and down 
the west coast here. They got bad at peak times, then were fine at 
night. Then they got worse at peak times and were fine at night. Then 
they got horrible at peak times and unplayable at night.

One of my friends has now switched to DSL and while he misses his fast 
download speeds (which remained fast despite the high pings) he enjoys 
having a constantly good ping and reliable connection for when we play 
Counter-Strike.
