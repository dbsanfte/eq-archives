    Depends what class you play I guess. I have an SK and no intention of
ever getting ykesha, as the SK spells added with it wouldn't be worth buying
for a coupla plat at a vendor in freeport - let alone paying real life money
for and then spending hours questing. I also think the mapping system takes
more out of the game than it puts in, and haven't found my interest perked
up by anything else in the expansion. I've also never wanted to be a frog,
for some reason.

    LDoN is sounding better, but I think making the augmented items nodrop
is a mistake, and so far the biggest impact it's had on me is that the
people I normally group with are out of my reach until I pay sony yet more
money ;)

Cheers,
James
