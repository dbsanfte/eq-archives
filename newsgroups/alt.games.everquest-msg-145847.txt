Yeah I noticed something too in dawnshroud killing Zelniaks.
Usually they sometimes resist my terrorize animal or the TA wears off real
quick.
Since the patch this isn't the case anymore, however my Firestrike gets
resisted more often now and also Immolate is more resistant(altho very high
resist spell, but but very nice to stack with drones)
And since the damage spells take more mana to cast as compared to TA im not
all to happy how that is going to be in other zones, because I have not
problems casting a few TA's in a row.
