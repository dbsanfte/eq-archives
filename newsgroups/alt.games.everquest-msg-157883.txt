Not necessarily, but it should be a possibility. I dont agree with a law
that just says blanket "no loot for you"

So if someone is more deserving, then give it to them. This works perfectly
well with giving eval members a dib on items. Maybe the full members who
turn up arnt all that deserving? What about if a chanter only item drops,
should that go to someones alt instead of me? I think this should be a mater
for the raid leader to work out himself, not to be set in stone like it was.
Remember, im not asking to get the item, merely to be up for consideration.

lol, looking after number 1 has become a habit of late. I guess it gets
influenced over time by the quality of people you meet.

Ok, so you probably wont get any loot during that time anyway, but I still
dont agree with the principal of it.

No Im not, I just think its wrong on principal. I told them that and then I
removed myself. There was no whining, so please stop calling me names, It
doesnt do justice to the rest of your post.
Maybe when I get to 60 ill chill out and raid for a couple of weeks for
nothing, since as you say it probably wont make any difference. I still want
to get to 60 above all else right now, so for now ill be staying in my
hopeless guild that never does anything.
