Final Fantasy flirts with some of the first way of this. Several 
storyline targets can only be accessed if at least person is at the 
proper point in the storyline to get to it. However, to prevent the 'I 
can't advance the storyline cause everyone's done it' syndrome, they 
allow you to 'go back and help'. But if everyone in the party has done 
the mission 3 dragon fight, you cannot fight the dragon again.
