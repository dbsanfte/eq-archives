You want me to argue "ONE FACT" ... sure how bout this one:

Possible yes. Beleivable no. From a website that spends 100% of its 
efforts discrediting a "movie maker" you want me to beleive they aren't 
fanatics??

'liberal' is a word I don't think you even understand.

Proven? Hardly. In fact I think that is one of the themes that 
intelligent viewers of Moore's film discovered... that gun laws 
themselves aren't the biggest factor. Moore himself was at a loss... 
there is no direct correlation between guns and violent crime... Canada 
among the safest countries in the world, has boat loads of legal guns 
including handguns... yet America has several orders of magnitude more 
crime.

Now he's my "Hero" eh? Where exactly will your making assumptions about 
me, and then painting me with them end??

For example...

Moore splices in a clip "From my cold dead hands" ...

The site makes a page of hullaballoo about it being deceptive... I don't 
know about you but I *could* tell it was an unrelated clip even on the 
first (and only viewing), there primarily for dramatic effect.

Wow some FACT.

Whats to refute? Your site is right ... it was a clip thrown in for 
dramatic effect. I could see that... the site telling us that isn't a 
bad thing... but Moore never "lied" about it. And jumping up and down 
about how it has real "facts" is a little trite.

Overall it was a pretty trivial affair.

Here's another example:

"Australia: Bowling says 65. This is very close, albeit picking the year 
to get the data desired. Between 1980-1995, firearm homicides varied 
from 64-123,  although never exactly 65. In 2000, it was 64, which was 
proudly proclaimed as the lowest number in the country's history."


Ok...65, 64, who cares?

Hell triple the highest Aus year (still less than 400), and halve the 
lowest US year, and then divide it so that its per capita instead of 
absolute ... and its still an ugly picture for the USA.

The point stands, regardless of trivial numerical details.

Quoting?? I said he made a good movie on the subject (If you scroll back 
you see I even called it a documentary/movie because even back when I 
first brought it up I was fully aware of the fact that it was not an 
entirely legitimate documentary.)

Lol. You'll notice how they headlined that Moore accuses "THIS SITE"...

Except that he didn't. He made some pretty generic statements about 
'internet crap' ... it took moorlies.com to take it upon itself to infer 
and even assert (uh-oh, deceptively even) that he was actually talking 
about them.

They must be thrilled ... Moore almost acknowledged them :)

This site is terrible example of objective journalism. No worse than 
Moore himself, but no better.

Boy that really got you bent out of shape didn't it? It may have blurred 
the lines, and it certainly wasn't unbiased... but if I was going to 
pick a genre it would still be a "documentary". It fits there better 
than elsewhere.

I couldn't care less myself, Awards shows are invariably pointless 
drivel anyways. I don't watch them, or keep track of them. If everyone 
else took the same approach they'd fade into the obscurity they belong.
