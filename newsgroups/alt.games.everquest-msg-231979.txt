   Well, he's an ogre, so I don't suppose we can do much about him being
stupid.  But I know I can work on the "slow" part.  

   Right now he's wearing a FBSS, haste 21%,
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=899 

   I've been looking at getting him a Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt, haste 34%, 
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6279 .  Right now they are
going for around 40k on FV.  This will take me a while to get, but it is
doable.  Another, probably better, option is this Pegasus-Hide Belt, 41% haste,
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=981.  It is droppable on FV,
and I think the price is running around 150k.  This would take quite a while for
me to save, but I think that once I did, he wouldn't need another haste item for
quite a while.

   I asked for suggestions on the AGE channel, and got several.  One I remember
was for a Soulscream Belt, haste 31%,
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=21436 .  Nice-ish stats, but I
don't know that it's what I'd call vastly superior to what he has now, or to the
Seahorse belt.  And I don't know the price or how available they are on FV.  

   So, anyone know if I am overlooking some obvious choices here?  And
suggestions on which way I might want to go?
