Person with highest total gets it.  Or if thats a match then you go to plan B,
which is either officer call, vote of the raid, or (most likely) roll off.

Two people with identical point values is a rare event, and those two being
the top bidders (or top people calling the item) for an item would be
an even rarer event.  Still system had better have the solution decided on
beforehand or there's going to be a hassle when it happens.
