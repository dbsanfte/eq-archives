I've got a Barbarian Warrior I started about a week ago, but haven't used
much so far. He's currently lvl 3, but I got him from lvl 2 to 3 by having
him turn in Deathfist Slashed Belts in Freeport. I know the Warrior epic is
a 2hs weapon that splits into two 1hs weapons and back, but I kind of want
to train him in 2hb AND 1hs (I don't really care that much about 2hs, but do
want him to get to AT LEAST 100 skill with it someday).

Last night, I was in a group hunting FGs and Wolves in the Great Divide (as
Zyrtryx Conjureblade, my lvl 35 High Elf Magician), and won a roll for a
Drakkel Icegrinder that dropped. (I also won a roll for a Drakkel Forged
Sledgehammer, but sold it to a vendor later after the group broke up) I've
still got the Icegrinder, and was wondering if it would be a good weapon for
my new Barbarian Warrior to use to raise his 2hb skill, since it is supposed
to proc at lvl 1, but his Dex is only around 78. But even without the proc,
27 dmg is nothing to sneeze at!

Or should I go for something with a better dmg\dly ratio, and lower dmg
(because he's pretty much going to destroy anything he actually hits with it
with 1 blow right now.....)?

The Barbarian now has the gear that was on my old Human Warrior, and is
using a Centi SS for 1hs and a Runic Carver for 2hs; don't plan on having
him practice Piercing at all (My Ranger uses 1hs and Piercing; Icetooth's
Claws and a Brightwood Spear), or 1hb for a few more lvls. With his current
gear, his str is 148, so he should do some decent dmg with his weapons.

If I stick with the Icegrinder, should I look for some pieces of gear that
have bonuses to both Str AND Dex?
