I have just watched another funeral (on tv) of a policemen killed in the
line of duty.
Personally, I don't believe there is such a thing as police overreacting
when there is a potentially violent situation and someone points a gun at
them.

Such situations wouldn't happen, of course, if the police just ignored the
activities of unruly group and let them terrorize the neighborhood.

This is an EQ site.  Do the city guards overreact if you walk up and hit
them or cast a dot on them?
