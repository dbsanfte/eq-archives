I've heard many people mention that the reason for the exp given in a
raid being 60% of what the kill would normally be is to prevent the
exploit of everyone in a dungeon being in a raid to split exp.  This
simply cannot be true.  The only people who would benefit from the
raid would be those people who are getting less experience than the
better group.  The better groups would never want to split their exp
with anyone else.  The problem would be self correcting.

For example, say two 6-man groups are in a dungeon. Call them A and B.
 They decide to create a 12-man raid.  As long as A and B are
generating exp at the same rate, they both get exp at the same rate
they did before.  So A kills a mob, 50% of the exp goes to B.  Then B
kills a mob, 50% of the exp goes to A.  No benefit to anyone. They're
getting exp at the same rate they did before.  But then say A decides
to sit around and talk about their favorite cereal.  They are not
contributing but they continue to get 50% of B's experience.  B would
soon leave the raid when they noticed their exp rate went in half.

The only people who would want to join the dungeon wide raid would be
slackers who wanted a free ride.  Anyone actually producing exp would
not want to donate it to those slackers.  Hence, no one in the raid
who's producing any exp.  Problem solved.
