I agree. However the fact that one may not is evidence of nothing.

There's one of the many reasons.

Spam is extremely relevant. I don't know where you get the idea that it's 
not. It can't be legitimately dismissed from the discussion. It's the 
number one reason I don't use my main email address on Usenet. I also see 
no reason to utilize a spam filter just to make you feel better about my 
intentions. This fact speaks neither well nor ill of me.
