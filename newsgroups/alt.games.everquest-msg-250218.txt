Not that I'm convinced this is a terribly good idea (I think travel is
already a bit too easy), but if you limited it to, say, near the
succor point in a zone, then you wouldn't have much of a content
bypassing problem, and wizards wouldn't need to be parked, since they
can just zone in and succor.  It would make it slightly less slow to
gather a group from all over Norrath, and cutting down LFG/LFMore
times seems a good cause.  Of course you can solve that by finding the
right people to group with, but that's not always so easy...
