Lately Ive been doing  a LOT of doing with my warrior and my wifes cleric.
Its been a blast, and surprisingly enough the experience has been
phenomenal. So far we have tried Dulak Harbor, Guthank, Dreadlands, and
Burning Woods. Guthank, and Dreadlands are starting to teal up quite a bit,
though so they have been avoided lately. Burning Woods has been a lot of
fun, non-stop pulls and getting decent Experience, about 1% every other
kill. We would really like to try and do some indoor hunting though. Im not
really familiar with a lot of the indoor zones though, as my Druid tended to
avoid them like the plague. Anyone have any suggestions for this ? The
warrior is a Wood Elf level 47 ( almost 48 ), and the cleric is halfway in
to 46. We both have decent to Middlin' gear.  When the Warrior hits 49, I
want to move on to Velektors Labrynth, but I would like to get some
experience dungeon delving before we get to that point.

Anyone have any suggestions ? Any input is appreciated!! :)
