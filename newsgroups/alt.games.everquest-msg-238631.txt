Money is easy to make, supply tradeskillers with their basic materials..

spider silks, heady kiola's, swirling shadows, leather padding, all these
sell to high level tradeskillers, to whom platinum is infinitely less
valuable than the time spent hunting or making them.

Bone chips sell almost everywhere for 1pp each, go to Hollowshade, farm
items there, farm seawind necklaces. Use your knowledge of the game, kill
mobs that drop items that sell, sell them.
