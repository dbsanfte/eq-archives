During the course of my life recently, I came across some interesting
info..

Let's say in your will, you leave say, 10 million dollars to your son
and 10 million dollars to your daughter and the balance of your estate
(500 Million) to a charity.

Obviously, your son and daughter ain't gonna be too happy about that.

However, in your will you stipulate that the son and daughter will
only receive the 10 mill *if they do not contest the will*.

Now, my question is....  Is such a stipulation legal..

On the one hand, if you believe (as I do) that a will is a "gift" and
should have no legal requirements of "fairness", then this would seem
to be a legal move.

However, with so many legalities surrounding the will and probate
process, I would think that such a move would not be legal. 

On the THIRD hand, if it IS, in fact, legal I would think that a lot
of people would be doing this and if everyone did it, it would
virtually eliminate contested wills..

Comments on the subject??
