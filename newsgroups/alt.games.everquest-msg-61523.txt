No, druids will not get the Luclin port (unless that has changed from
verants intial stance). Space travel is considered a wizzy port ala
their monoply on plane ports. Best we druids can hope for are moon
side ports which at best function only while on the moon, much like
the old kunark evacs used to, that only functioned inside kunark
dungeons.
