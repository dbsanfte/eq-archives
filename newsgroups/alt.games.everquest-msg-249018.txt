}Make sure you turned all sound off.

I've also gotten significantly better results doing this if I:

1) Create a new directory, C:\Program Files\Everquest2
2) Copy the Everquest directory there in its entirety (which takes about 
   20 minutes, heh)
3) Create a desktop shortcut to the new EverQuest.exe file
4) Make sure when I run two instances that one is in the original EQ 
   directory, and the other is the EQ2 directory.
