Actually, that's the interesting thing. I'm pretty sure that Cancel Magic
has a level limit. A level 1 Enchanter with Taper Enchantment can't even
strip J-Boots off a high level PC in a PvP environment. So I imagine that
the rule applies to NPCs, as well.

There are -many- legitamate reasons to remove a PC's debuffs. I've used it
to help an Enchanter mez things that some retard Necro Darknessed, for
instance.

I cannot justify using Cancel Magic to remove Mez unless there is some
obscure reason I can't think of. However, I thought it was worth mentioning
as a feature. It does help someone learn that you can't mez a NPC and then
remove it's buffs...
