I still see clerics as deadweight in normals, I usually make them ML to 
make up for this hehe, what I'd like to see (and it's been a while) is 
peridots on the merchants in LDoN camps, along with perhaps a 10% drop 
rate for peridots from LDoN mobs (or whatever the level specific symbol 
gem is). I recently filled up my dots after a month of ignoring them. 
About 1200pp right there, perhaps I need to start shaking my groups 
down, nobody things a paladin might use dots when they ask for symbol.

I sometime get asked my groups if I need virtue when I tank (actually I 
think I've tanked my last 100 or so ldon) usually I just tell them 
theres 5 figures in my HP figure and they drop it. I usually berate or 
kick people who go off looking for buffs, or start the mission without them.
