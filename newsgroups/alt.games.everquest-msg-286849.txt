i'm amazed that AA spells are on there! makes sense, but i wouldn't
have thought to check there

also, i just found out that therunes.net FORUM is alright ... not much
info on the last 2 expansions but at least it's something

i also didn't know they changed yellow con to be 3 lvls above you ...
so at 70 i could have stasis-mez'd anything yellow, and at 71 only
some yellows

well they give us a mez at 71 and at 72, so we're able to help out in
the new content quickly ... hopefully there will be a useful mez

bah, fair point - i was thinking OoW zones...nightmare stasis isn't
really a must-have based on the spells we get, huh? well i'm sure i'll
play with the spells enough before switching back to AA to decide if i
think it's worth it

that's *exactly* my fear ... gonna pass on this, at least until i

where do you duo/trio at 75? what's a good charm zone?

it does sound a lot like surfing a tidal wave (what do you do when you
hit land?)
and i sort of talked myself into it while writing my original post -
it would be fun for breaking camps, having a guaranteed charm

i love getting rez'd

i'm glad you know what i'm talking about, i was afraid of "go be a
wizard" respones (but then again, there's no one really here to do
that, huh? hehehe....)

i really don't want to know the math because that spoils the illusion
for me, but do you think it's a nice increase? what's "adequate" ? how
often do you crit, and how much do you nuke/crit for? is it "cool" at
least?

sorry to be so subjective about that =P

i only blur when i run through a zone and screw up ... i'll kite a
bunch and AE blur my train until i can enter a camp

do you blur normal mobs? do you blur a mez'd mob after tash/slow? i
normally just cast a rune in case the tank doesn't taunt

would you recommend that as a good habit? did you mean something else?

hmm...i'd bet my soul your mana pool is at least double mine, and i
tend to be very stingy so i don't often go low (and in taxing zones
i'll build a group with a shammy/BL so i don't have to slow, etc...)
-- so how often (and, i guess, where) do you play normally and find
yourself using gather mana? or is it that you like to be able to but
don't necessarily use it?

does it come in handy on raids? i am probably not going to be doing
much raiding (though if that changes i can just get this...)

how does it work? it steals 1000 mana and gives you a crystal which
you can click to gain 1000 mana? and then, i assume, there's some
transfer cost (like it actually takes 2000 mana or something?)? how
often can it be used? would you rank this higher than GoM? is it fast/
instant click, or slow like summoning spells?

this is VERY interesting to me ... it costs 100 mana per tick to use
this buff? and it knocks 80% off the damage you take? that's
AMAZING ... that sounds overpowering! we could tank anything if we had
good mana!!

how often do you use this? do you keep it up anytime you're near
danger? do you deliberately use it as a tanking tool? do you turn it
on and pull/tank ??

is this a buff? is it passive? is it triggered by something? i heard
of this - i heard it stuns things that hit you, but i heard that in
the "this is broken" context ... assuming it's not, then? does it work
on everything that's stunable (no lvl cap)?
