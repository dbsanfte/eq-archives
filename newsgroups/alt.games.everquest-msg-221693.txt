His problem is that he's not comparing equivalent level weapons.  If Copper
hammer was a raid drop, it would be about NToV level is my guess.   Which
would make a more appropriate comparison to something like

Gaudralek, Sword of the Sky: Dmg 43, Dly 38. Wt 9.00. +50 AC, +100 HP, LORE
MAGIC NODROP Effect of Rage of the Sky.   (179 DD proc)

Rather than the dam 28, delay 31, no proc he was comparing it against.
