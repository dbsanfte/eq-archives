I've not been on it myself but what I've heard is the largest
benefit of the server is the improved CS. This is mainly what the
server is, an improved CS server. About a year or more ago 
verant asked in a poll when you went to get into EQ if you'd pay
$49 for an improved CS server. Since then the idea grew into the 
Legends server, which has MORE than just improved CS for $39 (kind of
rare that the price went down instead of up, I guess.)

What I've heard is you get a full GM, paid CS employee, to answer your
petition usually in under 20 minutes. On my server, tribunal,  in the
evening I've had it take 2 hours just for a GUIDE to answer.

So if better CS is meaningless to you, the only other stuff it has are
gm events sometimes and new zones first. By virtue of the higher price
tag I've heard the quality of the masses playing is also higher.

I Plan to go and try it before I quit EQ, if I have not before that.
