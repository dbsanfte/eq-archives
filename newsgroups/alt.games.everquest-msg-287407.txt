Sure, it was perhaps an oversimplification, but the point holds true.
Add tanking as a third function, and you've got the game mechanic
that, while all MMORPG's are based on it, is not developed nearly to
the degree that it is in EQ. It's just watered down.

Raids have their purpose: gearing up. Even though raiding seems to be
the primary focus of the devs these days, it's hardly what defines EQ,
IMO. As you say, it tends to reduce players' roles a bit depending on
the target mob. However, when you're talking about 40 players being
involved, playing your respective role is the logical tactical
approach.

Step away from that, however, and you've got the group/solo
experience, where all your tricks are required, unless you're content
to stick to content that offers little risk. In the latter case, yeah,
you become a button masher.

Yet you chime in having "never even played WoW"? ;)
