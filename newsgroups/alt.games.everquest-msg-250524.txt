Gamecards are like two months, so it could just be paid forward, like
you have X amount of subscription credit. So when the two months is
up, you don't have to use a game card again until the money you've
racked up is gone. Like if they had 25 bucks or what not, no need to
buy a game card for two months once their current one runs out.
