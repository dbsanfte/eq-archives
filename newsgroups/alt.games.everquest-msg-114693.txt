No. Unfortunately, you wont' be able to. VI will only transfer
characters under certain conditions, between certain servers, and always
for a fee. (I think it starts at 50 bucks, but you can check their
homepage for specifics.)

However, in general, you can't go to/from a normal "blue" server to a
PVP "red" server, or to one of the special rulesets servers. You can
only transfer to another server of the same type. If you are on Seventh
Hammer you can only transfer to another Blue server.  And even if you
do, you can not take *any* of your stuff with you. You show up naked.

Now think... how much of serious value do you really have on any of your
characters at level ten or below. Is it really worth 50 bucks to
transfer them to a new server and have to collect the same gear all over
again anyway? If you want to move, at your level it is a trivial matter
to just go start a new character with the same race/class/stats, etc.
(hell, the same name if you're lucky) and just begin again. You won't
lose that much time. You can sit down on a Saturday mornign and take a
character to level ten on one playing session if you put your mind to
it.

Good luck.
