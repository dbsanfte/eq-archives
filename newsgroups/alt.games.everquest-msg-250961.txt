No troll here. I've seen it up close. Not just one or two but several
family members and their friends/S.O.s. etc. Wasted years, thrown away
scholarships, no normal activities beyond subsistence level needs, pitiful
personal relationship skills with real family members and friends, no
ambition beyond getting the next fucking dragon or whatever, and on, and
on.
 When you lose your zest for real life and treat unknown strangers better
than you treat the people who have nurtured you/raised you/ stood by your
side/ given to you, you need HELP! 
 I've seen people crying, virtually hysterical, when their computer failed
and they couldn't meet their "guild" brothers for an "important" date. It
doesn't matter that they've let important family responsibilities go by
the wayside forever. 
I dare you all to click that link that tells you how many days you've played.
 Honestly consider if you're not spending way too
much time sticking your brain into a fantasy world. Every hour/day/month
you do, you've been checked out of reality. It honestly can reach a level
of addiction equal to drugs, alcohol, or gambling. IT CAN RUIN YOU LIFE!!!
I HAVE SEEN IT. IT IS REAL.

Sorry to bother you. Gone for good!(I know you'll appreciate that)
