No, they do not need better gear.  I go to RSS in comparable gear.  I go 
there with groups of people in comparable gear.  What they need is a 
guild tag that tells the people forming RSS groups that they are worthy, 
it is not the equipment that is at issue here.

As far as brain killing tedium, OOW single group obtainable gear is no 
more tedious to get than any other non instanced dungeon expansion.  In 
fact, if you find it that bad, RSS is no different, just better drops for 
doing the same thing you have been doing all along...
