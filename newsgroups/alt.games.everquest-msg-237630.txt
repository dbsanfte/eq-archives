Heh,

I'd have to go the other way, IF there is a GOD, then everything we do is
preknown by him/her/it and thus our actions are PREordained, and you have no
free will at all, on the other hand, without a god, its all about brownian
motion, and you have choices. I really don't see how your logic works
