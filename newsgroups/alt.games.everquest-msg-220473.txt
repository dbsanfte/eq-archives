You know, way way way back in the day, when I was a lil ranger just
coming up on, ohh, I guess level 18, I met a gnome with a rubicite
bracer and was so terribly excited I asked if I could try it on to
see how it looked. I was wearing a little banded and leather at the
time. Had never had plate, the only options at that point that I
knew of were rubicite and the vox bracers from permafrost.

He lent it to me, I tried it on, ooh'd and aah'd, took screenshots
and gave it back. A few levels earlier while wandering through the
karanas I did the same thing with some rubi leggings.

At this point rubicite was THE top end armour too - you're talking
borrowing someones time drops nowadays, assuming they were tradable.

EQ has changed ;/
