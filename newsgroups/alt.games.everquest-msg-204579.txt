Peridot... but any gem really.

Get your charisma up to 106+ on both characters, if you are dealing with a
indifferent or better con vendor then thats as good as your prices can get.
This is easy to do with Opal Encrusted Steins for most characters, and now you
don't even have to worry about buying some for each character, just leave your
pair in the trade slot.

I always used peridot for transferring funds because that way my characters
also had some available to recompense clerics for Aego... but now low level
characters are immune, so thats not so important, nice to have as a "thanks
for the rez" thing I guess...
