Make the cheapest item that you can that isn't trivial.  At skill 21, that'd
be silver cat's eye agate.  When that trivials, move to the next item,
silver bloodstone.

When you reach the point where silver+gem costs more than
electrum+malachite, switch to electrum+malachite.  This is at silver+amber,
but you may want to postpone the switch to electrum a bit longer, to reduce
your chance of failure.  Some people switch at topaz, some switch at pearl.

When you start working with gold, enchant every bar.  You'll be able to sell
it back to the vendor for a hair more than cost of materials.  At higher
skill levels, this is enough to offset your cost of failure.
