Don't know if it is related, but if I hit the "+" key it will always
result in "++" in EQ.  This only occurs in EQ, so it has nothing to do
with my keyboard.

On a side note, anyone ever have this annoying little bug where
clicking in a text box in the trader or bazaar window produces a bunch
of r's?  For example, I click and type "bow" and it comes up "rrrbow".
 I believe it has something to do with recapturing the mouse when
switching applications.
