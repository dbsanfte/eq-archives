Silly me, I thought you were serious about the Sleepers thing. Must have 
missed a smiley in there someplace!

I think you have to look at the general population of your guild.. what do 
THEY want? You mentioned that not many seem motivated to get to level 50. 
It's 
gonna be hard to motivate them to do so. Part of it may be that they don't 
see 
a "reason" to level that high. I used to feel that way myself.. in my old 
guild, the leader was level 45, so I didn't really see the point of going  
beyond 40. Levelling was getting tedious (little did I know how awful 45 
would 
be!) and I spent time on my alts. That guild sort of self-destructed so I 
went 
unguilded and was in no hurry to get into another guild. I did miss guild 
chat, though! :-)

Then I grouped with two people who turned out to be alts of higher peeps in 
my 
current guild. They said a lot of great things about their guild, and it 
peaked my interest. I read their guild forums and liked what I saw and 
decided 
to apply for membership. Best EQ decision I've ever made. Great group of 
people, very mature & respectful of each other, and they know how to play 
the 
game. Most importantly, I'm more motivated to level my character. Not only 
do 
I know what I can do at 50+, I know I have a group of people to do it with. 
So, for me, it worked out wonderfully.

>Thanks for the input. But getting away from fantasy, day-dreaming land, it 
would
>be rather nice to see them get to the point where we could field two full 
groups
>to go into Old Seb without getting TPW'd by then, eh?

I think you have to figure out where you want to spend your time. Being a 
guild leader is a huge responsibility.. I think I mentioned our leader has 
140 
days played on his main. Now, he's done a ton of raiding, and spend a ton of 
time helping other people recover from raids gone wrong (he's a necro). 
Bringing your current guild members up in levels, without losing them as 
they 
level up, will be a major challenge. And, it will take a lot of your time. 
Forming a new higher level guild will also be time consuming. I think of the 
various options presented, I'd go for either (1) an alliance with other 
guilds 
or (2) finding a guild to join that is already well-established, has a 
philosophy that you like, etc. Start making a lot of contacts.. you'll need 
them whichever way you go! :-)
