As someone who has played both games a fair amount but prefers EQ, let
me throw in my two bits.

It's much, much easier to solo in AC, if that's what you prefer.  I'd
say soloing is the norm and grouping is usually done as a break from
it.

As someone who likes to group, though, I much prefer EQ.  AC's
grouping is much more primitive.  And the communication system in AC
is dreadful.

Exactly.  Although in theory you can be whatever you want, it's very
easy to totally screw any long-terms plans for the character at
character creation, which has led to the creation of "templates" --
generally accepted recommendations of where to put points at creation
for a desired character type.  In practice, there are really only
three classes:  melee, archer and mage, with several subclasses of
each of these.

AC's graphics shine on the terrain.  The characters and the mobs are
pretty two-dimensional.

The advancement system in AC is pretty neat.  It's so complex and
interwoven that you can spend half an hour deciding how to spend a
single point.

Yes, but in AC you can see literally for miles.  And you won't see a
zone wall at the limit of your vision.

AC wins here hands down.  The ambience of the world, the weather, even
the way the quality of the light changes during a day or from day to
day in the same season is quite phenomenal.  And the sky.  The sky is
maybe the best part of AC, especially at night.

It's the ambience of AC, the memory of a view from a particular
vantage point, that occasionally pulls me back to play it for an hour
or two.

AC is still very unbalanced (or it was the last time I played).  At
early levels, archers are gods.  Later on, having Life Magic is
considered almost essentially for ANY class because of the power of
some of its spells.

And there is no rush in AC like that of a well-functioning group in
EQ.

AC might be bigger, not sure on that.  But in AC there are vast, empty
areas.  Nothing but trees, hills, and monsters to kill for mile after
mile.  You could probably run for an hour and be an hour farther away
from any city.  Good if you're a loner, I suppose.

The only problem is, character progression requires no thought in EQ,
or practically none.  AC's character progression is much more
interesting, it's one of the best things about the game.

So why aren't I still playing AC?

One thing that REALLY irritated me was how little time buffs last.
You are CONSTANTLY rebuffing yourself and your friends, and since this
involves putting away your weapon and taking out your wand (and
possibly taking off and putting on various attribute jewelry), it's
just a big pain in the butt.

Also, after a certain point the game just started getting pretty dull.
You get to the point where all the normally encountered monsters are
easy kills and you have to go hunt Olthoi or whatever.  You can only
do this so many times.

There's a lack of variety in AC.  EQ is much more colorful, with far
more variety and things to kill.  And there are still places in EQ I
wouldn't dream of going yet, as opposed to AC where it's "been there,
done that" pretty early on.
