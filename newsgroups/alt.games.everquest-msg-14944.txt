Hmm, maybe its different when you're that low in levels, but the general
formula is you can only get xp if there is noone in the group more than
1.5 times your level, so in theory a level 4 can only group with anyone
up to level 6 (4*1.5), whereas a level 30 could group with someone up to
level 45 (30*1.5). So a 4-8 orc hill group wouldn't work anyway.

If you *can* get xp with your group, then the formula is now very simple
- you get:

xp for kill * (your level / total of all groups levels)


Lets say your group is made up of a level 20, 4 level 25s and a level 30
(total levels = 150). You go gank some mob:

The level 20 will get 20/150 of the xp
The level 25s will get 25/150 of the xp
The level 30 will get 30/150 of the xp

So these days (since the big xp mechanism patch that simplified
everything) there really isn't much reason not to group with people at
the extremes of the level range.

Say you kicked out the level 30 from the group because you thought him
too high and took a level 20 instead (so total levels now = 140).

Now,

The level 20s will now get 20/140 of the xp
The level 25s will now get 25/140 of the xp

So the xp difference for the level 20s is (20/140)-(20/150)  = about
0.95% more xp than previously
And for the level 25s its (25/140)-(25/150) = about 1.2% more xp than
previously.

i.e., no appreciable difference worth worrying about, especially when
you consider you'll probably be far more effective with the higher level
PC helping you. Since you'll be able to kill more mobs in the same time,
you should more than make up for the negligible xp loss from grouping
with the higher level player in the first place.

Of course, you have a problem with mob resists that will limit what your
party can do if you have a wide level range.

Say you have a level 20 druid grouped with a level 30 tank - not much
sense in the druid trying to nuke the level 30 mobs the tank is taking
on since he'll just get resisted all the time. He can still heal, buff
and damageshield the tank, though, since he'll not be resisted for that.
All a question of adapting tactics to the situation.
