ZEM is a stupid idea to begin with. Should be done away with.
Any give mob of a certain level and difficulty should be the same
exp regardless of where that mob is. ZEM is an extremely poor
game design idea. It is totally stupid how it creates super crowded
zones in 10% of the game and the rest of the world is empty.
What a waste.
