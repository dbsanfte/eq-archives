Nither Just another calss that has a lot of spells that save a TON of real
life time to do other stuff and make EQ (real life thing less of a pain in
the butt).

TP / SOW / CHLORO And SNARE reason why I created a druid in the first
place...my RL friend had a necro and needed a company that matched well
....druid fits the bill perfectly....Today our gameing sessions starts with
Hey where you want to fight , what about CS or WL or maybe you would rather
try chardoc or sky fire if not we can always do LGuk ?  After all most of
those places are just a zone away. from where ever we are. How ever that has
costed me the ability to get into some guilds and groups. Cause druids are
not that "desirable in a group/guild"

Helped with a monk quest last night after TPing , healing buffing, non of my
combat spells would stick on the main mob. We come with in a inch of
disaster , had only 2 clerics, no wiz and 2 tanks + bunch of monks when all
was done I made a GREAT diffreance , I spiked ever melee and we lost most of
them, but the spikes did had to cause dmg in thousends, the last warrio was
kept a life mailny with my heals but yet heaving a cleric I know that my 40
cleric can out heal my 54 druid any day of the week and twice on sunday.  So
I guess all we needed was 1 druid for the whole raid...not a highly
desierable class in a guild or group...Fun to play great for playing when
you don't have too much time ( if I have less then 2h to play I don't even
bother to log in my warrior or cleric).

I think that people don't like druids cause they picked other classes with
out the stigma of a druid , but still would like to move around the world
freely. So they get mad that I wont TP then any time they ask, some times I
do some times I simply write /r no, sorry.... as a druid I take the good and
the bad. Its not my job to make sure you have fun and other don't have to
take the boat. My warrior has ask for TPs and rezes like any one else , yet
it seems ok to others that when I am a cleric or druid I have to spend my
whole day just giveing them out ....why ? sure I rez you if I can , and TP
if you going my way, but over all druid is no other then other classes , try
asking a tank to tank for you while you get some exp of that, try asking a
make to finish your mobs after they are pass half of their life , ask
enchanters to mez your pulls so you can better kill them,   then watch them
/r I am thinking NO !!!
