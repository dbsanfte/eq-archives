That nicely illustrates the problem with Tinyurl as currently implemented.
The way it should work is like this:

    1. When you make a Tinyurl, you get back two short URLs.  One of them
    looks like the current Tinyurls:

        http://tinyurl.com/stuff

    and the other would look like this:

        http://tinyurl.com/stuff/host

    where host is the host that the URL redirects to.

    2. When someone goes to a Tinyurl of the second form, Tinyurl would
    compare the host name that it is redirecting to with the host in the
    URL, and if they don't match, it would send you to an error page.

The idea here is that if someone wants to post a Tinyurl for, say, a news
story at cnn.com, they could post the second form, and then when people
click on "http://tinyurl.com/stuff/cnn.com" they at least know that it is
going to take them to cnn.com if it is legit, and nowhere bad if it isn't,
and not goatse.cx or some virus spreading page or something like that.

I seem to recall I sent them this suggestion a long time ago, but they never
answered, and obviously didn't do anything about it.
