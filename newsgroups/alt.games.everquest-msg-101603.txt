"Ppl,""peeps," very annoying.  A guildie says "RD" when he means "ready."  I
always always ask him "huh?  What's RD mean?"  Pee-pee-ell?  What's that?
Oh, never mind, I get it...the whole line should be "/gsay afk I gotta ppl"
right?  What's the "L" stand for, anyway?

"Prolly" annoyed the shit outta me 5 years ago, it doesn't bother me so much
anymore...a friend of mine actually SAYS "prolly" when talking!  Typing
"prolly" is kinda lazy...SAYING "prolly" is the DEFINITION of lazy.

Might want to look into taking a typing class for fun (they are fun)...then
you'd be like me and can be a high level enchanter guild leader expected to
deal with Tell Hell most of the time, even more while raiding, AND be
expected to be >>>>there in 2 minutes AND be able to type complete words. :)

Not sure what your excuse is when posting in Usenet though. :P
