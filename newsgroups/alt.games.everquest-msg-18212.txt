Not sure if they've been pulled, but maybe moved.  There were 3 skellies
near the front (1 front room, 1 in sm. TT room, and 1 by Elemental going to
Bonecracker) making it exceptionally hard for people to hunt the TT's and
the sitting ogre.  So far on 2 different trips I haven't seen any of them.
Hopefully they just moved them down a bit, or back behind the magician that
stands guard at the sign :)  Sure would make it nicer.
