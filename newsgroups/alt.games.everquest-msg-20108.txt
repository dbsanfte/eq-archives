Assuming you have:
2 PCs
a home LAN
2 purchased copies of EQ
2 accounts

All you have to do is copy your EQ folder from one computer to the other and
create a shortcut to everquest.exe where ever you want it.

EQ does NOT need to be installed, Verant made it so it's all self-contained
and you can move it around all you want...as long as you change the shortcut
properties you're good to go. :)
