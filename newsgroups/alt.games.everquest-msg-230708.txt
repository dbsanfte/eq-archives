Almost certainly due to the other mage casting Malosinia.  Same thing 
happens with Malo/Malos and the resistable debuffs.

Shaman potion, Heat Awareness III would give you an added 5% mana savings 
that stacks with item focus effects (for spells up to 60, there are 
awareness potions for the various spell types, levels 1 to 4).  
Unfortunately, the awareness potions are kind of pricey to make.  Don't 
recall off hand what a level 3 potion costs to make.
