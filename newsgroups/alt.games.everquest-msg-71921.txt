I do my best to avoid learning about any programming language but isn't XML
supposed to be the Next Great Thing When Porting to Another OS?

I don't know anything about Mac or XBox, but is it possible that XML is the

I have no clue, like I said, I'm not a coder.  Hell, talking about coding
makes me start to nod offfffffffffffff..........;lfkasf (sorry, forehead hit
