I've been noticing a few strange things lately with my connection. I use
a 56K dialup account with MSN as my ISP. The connection has been quite
stable and fast lately in EQ, but I noticed 2 days ago that for some
reason I'm only connecting at 28.8. However, the 28.8 connection,
EQ-wise, has been much faster and stable, smoother with better zoning
times and fewer LDs, than when it was connecting at 56K. I played for
hours yesterday without any glitches, until about 9:00 PM EST when for
some reason I just went LD. When I closed EQ my ISP connection had been
completely terminated, so maybe something is going on at MSN.
