The entrance hall to the Hole has some mobs that should be (just) blue to
you...tho most will be light blue.
I saw a twinked 52 Warrior hunting there, solo, before. TBH, at 55 I'd never
consider trying it solo....I can't even kill Slate solo (unbuffed)...but he
was doing it, with Fungi, BoC and SBoZ (looked to me like he was wielding a
lammy and a Yak...till I inspected him) his haste was only an RBG tho. If
you can get that ToD to proc early (do you get mortal deftness or anything
before hunting?) and a snare proc item then you shouldn't have any trouble
there. Decent ZEM so even the light blues will give ok exp.
Downside to that is that the entrance hall is popular so you may find it
camped already.

Other than that I haven't any suggestions...Blues at 55, I find, are just
too tough and hit too hard.
