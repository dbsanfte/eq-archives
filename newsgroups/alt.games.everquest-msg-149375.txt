Heh you know if all that happened was that I got KOS faction to these
guys after I had gotten my epic I'd be completely fine with it until
they fixed it. I mean jeez just get an alt of yours to drag your
corpse to the zone line and get a guildy or pay some high level cleric
to come rez. The end effect being you now have your friggn epic and
all it cost was a smigin of exp and a 50-100pp for a rez. I'd be so
stoked just to get my damn fear plane or kedge keep staves that I
wouldn't care much less getting my epic over with. Now if it wasn't on
the final turn in and all the guys went after you before you could get
your epic I'd be insanely pissed, but that's not the case. Hope they
fix it soon though that would be an inconvenience if there just happen
to be an epic mob you don't know about somewhere in the zone you're in
and you come close to it not knowing it's on that faction and poof
you're dead in a place you never expected to die, delaying whatever
you were going to do and making corpse retrieval and ressurection that
much more difficult.
