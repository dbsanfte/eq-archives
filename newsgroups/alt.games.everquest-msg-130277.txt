Think up a unique name and type /consent name.  Create a new iksar with that
name.  Log it in, go up to Glox and say "I am ready."  You'll be transported
to the locked room.  Drag your main's corpse to the locked door on the
hinged side (there is a small crack you can barely see through).  Log in
your main and head for the door on the opposite side (teleport on the main
floor of shaman guild, turn right and go down the ladders to the bottom).
You should be able to target your corpse and summon it from there.  I tested
this with a level 1 character.
