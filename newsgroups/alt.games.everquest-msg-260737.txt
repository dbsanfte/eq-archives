What concerns me here is the fact that they're cramming in a lot of fluff
changes along with the production move of an expansion.

Both the LoY and GoD prod moves went relatively smoothly, and I actually had
hopes that they had gotten in a good groove for expansion releases.  OTOH,
we have the graphics update fiasco.

Now they're attempting to do both in the same downtime ... an expansion
release and a graphics update.  Not to mention the bard tuning.

I have a feeling that this was a bit much to bite off.  Hopefully I'm wrong.
