Doesn't directly help skill-ups, no.  It will get you more skill-ups
vs. time played (and vs. exp. gained as well if grouping) because
the 24% haste means you will get 124 attacks for every 100 you'd get
without it (assuming no spell haste).  At any rate, I wouldn't call
a 24% haste item for a low level melee a poor choice unless you paid
some ridiculous price for it.

Good luck,
