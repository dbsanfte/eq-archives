*Thank* you.  Everybody has been raving about this and I thought I was 
missing something. :)  Not only is it dull, but for me, at least, it's a 
royal pita to move around in.  I keep having to switch views to keep it 
from starting to flicker back and forth between views when I get into 
smaller spaces, and I get stuck *very* easily, and I am sick, sick, SICK 
of having to talk to EVERY NPC I see.

Ryou
(definitely will be gaming with a friend on it when we both manage to 
learn it a little better but ugh, the learning process sucks)
