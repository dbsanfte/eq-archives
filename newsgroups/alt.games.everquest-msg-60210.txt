Indeed!  Guilds in Norrath are like organized crime or urban gangs in the
real world...  Great for loyal members, not always so great for unaffiliated
adventurers.

This doesn't apply to all guildlings, granted, but there's something about
having that <guild name> attached to your character name that makes certain
individuals feel that normal EQ etiquette no longer applies to them.  A
typical case would be an Uber with his epic pl'ing a tank in training.  I've
seen a couple of guys shut down the southern half of Sol A like this, with
no regard for anyone else who might have been there before them.  If you
miss the guy with bizarre armor and a glowing weapon, look for the lowbie
fighting 5 or 6 opponents and leaving scores of unlooted corpses lying
about.  Not that big of a deal, but...

Possibly even more annoying is trying to party with solo guildlings when you
know they will always put the interests of their guild in front of the party
that is currently covering their ass.  Typical case is they will adventure
for about 30 minutes, enough to get deep into a dungeon, then a guildmate
two zones over needs a port or a SOW...cya!  Saddest case was a guy who
abandoned us when his lowbie "wife" was getting harrassed in Black Burrow.
Worst case was a guildling that, as it turned out, was looting rich corpses
during battle (this occurred long before it was called "ninja looting" and
you got a message).  He eventually screwed up and and sent a guild tell to
the party bragging about all the plate he was stealing from us.  Funny, save
for the fact we had partied with him for months and thought he was a trusted
ally.  Kudos for rp'ing, I guess.

Others have pointed out the good points of guilds and I would add that it's
always nice carrying out various transactions with ranking members of major
guilds, as some of them realize they do have a reputation to uphold.
