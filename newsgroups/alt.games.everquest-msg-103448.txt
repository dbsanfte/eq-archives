Yano, I don't think she ever tried that one. Might suggest it to her.
Anyone got any experience with how it is to play EQ in 3rd person view

Eh, ok. Cyber as in cyborg, right? Man-machine, all that? I am Iron
Man! (Guitar riff) Man, make one lousy joke and get a lesson in

In case you weren't joking (Hey, on Usenet you never know!), cyber
cafes are internet cafes. A big room with lots of networked computers,
a bar and two dozen geeks fragging each other in a friendly game of
Terrorists vs. Special Forces. And a couple people actually sending
email and surfing, I guess.
