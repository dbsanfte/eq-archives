It used to be three hours, but now its something else.

Believe me getting a GM to do reimbursements is a nightmare, even as a
guide. We got the petitions all the time about them, would put them to
red, but the GM had many other things to worry about. Reimbursements
weren't the number one priority and quite often they would log without
doing any that night. After you get the same reimbursement petition
from the same person every day or two for a week you sort of run out
of things to say.

The system, it ain't perfect. :-p

Just keep trying. However unless the backpacks had soemthing of
significant value, don't kill yourself trying to get them back.

However I am curious how getting ported to safe spot would cause you
to lose two backpacks. Care to elaborate?
