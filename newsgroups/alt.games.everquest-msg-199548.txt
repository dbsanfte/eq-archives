Sorry if this sounds dumb, but for me it's when somebody who I don't
know from Adam comes up to me and /invites me into a group without
saying a word to me first (not sending me a /tell asking me if I want
to group or whatever), just walks up to me and hits the /invite
command.  I never /accept any group invite from anyone who does that
and I make it a point to ignore them.  

(and yes, I do realize it's just a game and that there are a lot more
important things to worry about, and I don't actually get worked up
into a rage about it, I just think it's annoying)
