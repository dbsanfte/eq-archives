Exactly. This is the one hurdle that faces every single MMOG currently or 
soon to be on the market. If there isn't some way of keeping just every 
idiot Joe Schmoe in the game from instantly acquiring that "Uber Blade of 
World Cleaving", then the game isn't going to last beyond it's free month.

Like it or not, the developers' only available tool for creating effort-
appropriate rewards is time. The winning formulae will be the ones that are 
best able to keep it as interesting as possible in spite of the inherent 
disadvantages.
