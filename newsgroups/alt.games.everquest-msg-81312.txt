    They must have worked extra overtime on this one. A LOT of goodness!

    You will really start to miss the old camp once you see the free-for-all
Ragefire just became.

    I bet it's on the "things to do" list. Remember a while back when they
asked for people to mail in broken quests? I bet this is the start of fixing
them.

    Anyone seen what the new AC values are?

    Same here. Since my rogue doesn't pull as much, I can wear the RBF
full-time and make some room in the "resist gear and odds and ends" bag.

    So, open question: for a monk, where the STR boost would put him over
100 STR, would you go with a weightless AC 10 STR 7 Sv. Cold and Poison 7
neck, or a weightless AC 12 neck?  Same question, for a warrior where the
STR increase is irrelevant?

    At first I thought that this was just going to be a Kunark/Velious
armour thing, for right-click effects. Dream King has reported that the
Fungi was nailed with this too, though. Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing
armour and weapons restricted from being used until their procs/right-click
effects would be usable by the owner. And that's with me having a level 25
SHM with four pieces of Kunark armour on her.

    Note the "shades in Vex Thal" part. Heh, like anyone noticed they
weren't before....

    This was long-overdue. Hmm, just wondering.... where is the new GD
portal to Nexus, anyways? If it was in those abandoned spires, well, a lot
of stuff paths through there.

    "Rounding out" might very well mean "we've added stuff on the drop
tables that isn't MNK/BST gear". It'll be neat to see what this entailed.

    They'd damn well better not! My dwarf's beard is still not
customizable.Until all features on all races can be customized, locking in
would be premature.

    It happens everywhere, it was annoying as anything, glad it's gone.
