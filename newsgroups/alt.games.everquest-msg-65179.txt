People who have been experiencing video problems,
especially the "black box" problem, should give
the game another shot and check their status again.

When I ran EQ in the afternoon, it downloaded a new
eqgfx_dx8.dll file, and it fixed several *bad* video
problems I had been having.

The bug fixers at Verant have been working overtime.
