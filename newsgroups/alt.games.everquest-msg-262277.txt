Her intentions is the crux of his legal case. Being a devout Catholic
she would not want to the object of sin.

Lacking evidence to the contrary, and with the shadow of his possible
complicity in her disability, it is very relavent what she thought. He
doesn't care, I agree. He has a conflict of interest, and this is
legalized murder in this case.

If you are the preventable cause of sin, then you are liable. The
three conditions for mortal Sin are, 1) Serious Matter 2) Sufficent
reflection, and 3) Full and free will (control of your actions). If
you give a man a gun, that he is otherwise able to own and he shoots
someone, you not culpable for a mortal sin.

Terri would not be the sinner, but she would be the proximate cause of
sin. If I gave a 19 year old girl with no drinking or sexual
experience a bottle of tequila, and she drank it down and had sex with
every guy in town, I would be the proximate cause of her sins. It may
then be Mortal, depending on the conditions. I caused her to sin
Mortally.

This is besides the point. What you can prove is the legal issue. She
had never made this know, and a young woman almost never discusses
this without writing something down, or without any other witnesses
that contradict her parents.

Not the point here, but if I was in a coma I would not want to be
starved to death. I can see turning off a respirator.

She was never given any form of rehab by her "husband". Many of those
things are preventable by rehab. The just is still out if she is dead
or not, right now she is a human being.

All these things are emotional issues. I don't want this person to
murder his wife legally.

I was handed a living will by an insurance carrier, it was
objectionable, I edited it, and returned it. The insurance
representitive would not file the "voluntary" document. I made copies
for my Doctor and Lawyer.

What do you think would be supplied to some teenagers, along with a
descrition of the awful way people who are spending the HMOs money
live...
