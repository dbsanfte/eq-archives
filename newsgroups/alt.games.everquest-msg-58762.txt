I had to read that five times before it sank in. (Reminder: I am far
from the brightest bulb on the tree.) However, I think I've sorted
through it and you've got the right numbers/formula... it's just a
horrible way of describing it. For example, "116% of 22" which you then
say equals 18.97. The problem is that 116% of 22 is, in fact, 25.52,
just as 50% of 22 is eleven.

But your numbers are right because you are taking the base speed of the
weapon and effectively <decreasing> its delay by subtracting the
percentage haste from a base speed value of 100%, or 1.00 in decimal
form to come up with a new lower number (1 - %haste), expressed in
decimal form, to get the new delay value. The same could be done for a
slow spell/debuff. Except then we'd add the percentage change to reflect
the increased delay time. Your hypothetical 9/22 weapon has a base ratio
of 22/9 or 2.444444~.  If Mob_01 casts an 18% slow spell on you, then
the weapons ratio will be 22 * (100% + 18%) / 9
or
(22 * 1.18) / 9 = 2.884  (worse ratio).

I have a sick feeling we're saying exactly the same thing, but somehow
the phrase "116% of 22" coming out to a lower number just didn't set
right.
