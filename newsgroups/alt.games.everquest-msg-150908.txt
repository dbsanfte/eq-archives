Unfortunate, then, that two people have already posted the one command you 
need to address this problem.  I hope you don't accidentally read their 
posts, it would be a shame to learn about something it isn't your job to, 
even if the /viewport command is pretty useful.

Oops!  Now I've done it, don't read my post either!  I wouldn't want you 
going to undue effort on my account.
