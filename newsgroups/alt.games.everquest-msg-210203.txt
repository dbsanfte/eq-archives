I was actually describing an AoW kill.  A 4-cleric, 1-group Vindi kill would
be...  slow.  But if that's the sort of environment you're coming from,
it explains your viewpoint well.  4 clerics for Vindi?  :P

So, Rydda Dar and Mithaniel Marr and Bertoxx are the last of the high damage
mobs it sounds like?  Mobs in elementals hit for a lot less?  I doubt it. 
It sounds like you just have overwhelming force for all fights, and more
particularly it sounds like you must be *very* cleric heavy (4 clerics for
Vindi?!?  :P ).
