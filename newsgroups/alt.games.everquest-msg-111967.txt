  This upsets me quite a bit.  The entire character of the server is about
the change overnight.  Those of us who decided to start a character on FV
did so knowing what they rules were, and knowing that those rules imposed
certain challenges and inconveniences not present on other servers.  We may
not like all the rules, but we knew they were there and we decided to cope
with them, and in many cases, even enjoy them.  Now those rules are being
changed on us midstream.

  Playing on FV, I get the feeling that I am playing FV the way it was meant
to be played, and for me it's a very enjoyable experience.  Come May 8th,
several of the defining elements of the server will be tossed
uncerimoniously out the window for all intents and purposes, FV will be just
another blue server.  I guess in Verant's book, the server is a failure.

  But I can tell you it was not a failure to the many of us who played on
that server and enjoyed it as a sort of last bastion for those dillusioned
with various elements of EQ.  FV is one of the things that brought me back
from a year long absence from EQ and it's definitely one of the things that
kept me here.  If it hadn't been for FV, I would've chosen to play on a PvP
server.  Now I'm beginning to regret that I didn't.  In fact I'm beginning
to regret I started playing EQ again at all.

  If you play on Firiona Vie, there's still a chance we can get them to stop
them from making these changes, or at least the biggest change, which is the
raising of the character limit per account from 1 to 3.  Once this change
goes in, they won't go back on it, because it means they would have to force
people to delete their characters.  If this goes in, there's no going back.
If the present population of the server is vocal enough, however, maybe
they'll hold off on this particular change and only implement the others.
So if you're against this change, email them NOW and tell them so, also do a
/feedback in game.  Also, add you name to this petition:
http://pub94.ezboard.com/ffirionaviefrm4.showMessage?topicID=572.topic.  It
seems to me the reasonable approach for them to implement these changes
incrementally to better assess their impact (positive and negative) on the
game, rather than do them all at once... especially if some of the changes
can't be revoked.

  The icing on the cake, for me, is that this change comes on the heels of
the price rate hike.  In FV I found an enjoyable place to play, and I
presumed that FV would continue to be an enjoyable place for me to play...
so I prepaid of 12 months to get a slightly better rate.  Now I'm stuck with
a game I'm not entirely certain I'll continue to enjoy.  Just perfect.
