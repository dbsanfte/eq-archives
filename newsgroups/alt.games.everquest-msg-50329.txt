there are too main methods for soloing at low levels.

the mesmer nuke method . use the level 4 mesmerise spell , tash , nuke
,mesmerise, nuke , mesmerise , nuke , mesmerise , nuke . This is very
similiar to a wizards root nuke method but mesmerise is cheaper, more
assured , but has a 15 second time limit and does not have the root
advantage of sometimes sticking . Chanter nukes are very useable with good
dammage to mana ratios they just recycle very slow . This method actually
gets better as you level up . (chanters start wimpy but get stronger with
level untill they get very high)

The other method is to summon a pet , buff it , and pull a mob . Keep the
pet alive by tanking the mob . Good spells to have for this are tash,nuke,
dot,gate, stun , and your rune/str type spell . Slow as well as soon as you
get it and mes, root , or fear for emergencies.

Once you get to level 12 you get your first charm spell . Master the first 2
methods untill you can flawlessly guarantee easy quick kills and then go die
many times beginning to learn the basics of charm soloing. Some key points
for charm soloing are 1) if you charm one mob out of a group of 6 they kill
that 1 mob before chasing you if you charmed at range . 2)Charm is cheap but
takes forever to cast when being chased by lots of mobs so be casting the
new one before the old charmed mob dies. 3) area stuns and mezzes let you do
obnoxious things to groups of mobs.

Mesmer nuke is particularly effective (annoy the wizards ). Your pet dosent
really get real till high levels, use only when you dont have room to roam
and are willing to incur the extra downtime. Charm soloing is particularly
powerfull but dangerous in most circumstances ( spectres are just fun
though )
