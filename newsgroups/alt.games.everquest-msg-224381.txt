We were playing in Skyfire one night and sat down near the Burning Woods
zoneline to med.  I went for a bio break and came back to "/OOC YOU FREAKIN
IDIOTS!! STAND THERE AND WATCH ME DIE!! I HATE YOU!! MY ENTIRE GUILD IS PUTTING
YOU ON IGNORE DONT EVER ASK US FOR ANYTHING" and on and on and so forth.  The
hate messages literally filled my chat screen.  My wizard friend tried to
explain that I was afk and he was oom but NO!!! some total stranger is /ooc'ing
the entire zone about how it's our fault she's dead.   She wasn't in our group
and we didn't agree to babysit her and I'd never heard of her guild.   I
couldn't believe it.  I promptly put her on ignore.
Another time my druid was helping PL a warrior friend in Paludal.  We were
doing the patog fiends or whatever they are, the ones that disease ya. 
Suddenly the warrior takes off around the bend and I follow.  He's beating on a
bandit, there's a dead robe laying at its feet and another tank beating at it's
backside.  
Next thing I know we are getting the /OOC NEXT TIME YOU AND JENNAII KILL STEAL
OUR BANDIT I'M PETITIONING YOU.  With one of them dead!!!  Hello?? Another one
added to the /ignore list.
Oh, oh, then there was the time where this idiot /ooc'd the entire zone that we
had brought a train to the zoneline in Dawnshroud.  For one it wasn't OUR
train, I saw it running by and announced it.  Luckily about 6 people /ooc'd
that we'd announced it THREE TIMES!  Idiot hadn't noticed.  /bonk.
Some people - and I'm not saying you are one of them - expect way too much.  If
I'm in trouble, I deal with it.  I don't train, I don't blame.  If someone
helps me I add them to my friends list.  I don't expect anything from
strangers.
I'm sorry your friend ticked you off and hope that today goes better for you.
