Subject: The way armor LOOKS... my 2 cents worth.

I am NOT impressed with the new graphics on any of my characters.  
Druid:  My mammoth hide pants look like they have tears in the butt...  weird.
Ranger:  Ivy etched looks spikey anyways, without the rabbit boots being bright
red.
Barbarian:  Got the new Soiled Breachclout, may sound gross but gotta love the
ac/wisdom.  Looks goofy tho.
And while I'm at it... how come none of the wizard hats have a big spikey point
like they are supposed to????
I've always picked my armor for the best stats at the best price with no
regards to how it looks.... but yuck!  Maybe I'm vain?
