In raid situations the difference from the extra hit points was huge.  In
exp group situations it was not.

No, they don't.  Alisdair can go on about Aggressive all he wants, but
unless he's planning on backing it up with numbers one of these days, I'll
continue in the more informed (than him) opinion that he's completely full
of shit about it.  Monks get better weapons easier, higher attack values, a
higher damage table and special attacks.

You've been around quite a while, Martin...  How many warriors have you
actually *seen* use aggressive?

Crippling blows are nothing.  I get perhaps 3 crippling blows a night (200
extra damage total, over what normal crits would have been, whee!), and that
only if I'm exp grouped with a cleric that likes to live on the edge.  If
you want to just talk raids (as you imply above in your discussion of FoH)
then remove them completely.  No non-MT warrior on the raid should get down
to bezerk level, and if they do they are not going to be left there so they
can get a tiny bit of extra damage out of crippling blow upgrades.  I don't
believe I've ever gotten a crippling blow while Main Tanking something.
Sure, it is theoreticly possible, but the chances of getting a critical hit
in the quarter of a second that you were beserk before the heal landed are
so small that they're not worth mentioning.

Stunnable kicks at 55....  I'll trade you my kicks for yours?  My kicks land
for between 1 and 40 damage (usually the lower range)... How much do monk
flying kicks land for?  Before or after Techniquie of Master Wu?  I'll take
either one...

Bash... I'm afraid I'll have to call foul on that one.  Only three of the
eight warrior races get a usable form of bash.   And more importantly, if
you're listing stunnable kicks, then the warrior is definitely not using
bash.  He gets a choice between one or the other.  If both bash and
stunnable kicks are advantages, then the monk has even more of a lead
there... he gets Flying Kick, Dragon Punch, Round Kick and Kick....
