*golf clap*

Congrads, you just found the single biggest problem facing clerics.
Until they get up in level, THEY ABSOLUTELY SUCK at exp grinds.

Even when they don't have problems getting into groups (because
ignorant twits refuse to do anything remotely challenging without a
cleric to hand hold them), by their mere presence in a group, you've
reduced the exp grind effectiveness of that group.
