No offense, but your saying it doesn't make it truth. It does still amount 
to hearsay. What *would* convince me is to see a reference to that original 
quote from a reputable publication.

I would ask, what proof do *you* have that it is, in fact, a factual quote 
and that he was the one who said it? Did you read it yourself in the 
original interview, or an official quote from said interview, or have you 
merely seen it propagated around the internet and by word of mouth?

I can't say he *didn't* say exactly that, but suffice it to say I'm a 
little skeptical. Heck, like I said, I've seen the quote more than once 
before myself, and it seems to me that I remember hearing someone else had 
actually said it. I'm sure there's some truth to the account. I'm just not 
so sure the names and particulars have been acurately represented.
