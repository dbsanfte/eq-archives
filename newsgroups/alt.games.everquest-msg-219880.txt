Hey guys,

I'm a Graphic/Web Design student and I'm building a site that's based
on a MMPORG. Since I don't have access to funds to form a focus
group--I wanted to ask you guys the following questions when you have
the time...I'd really appreciate it.

Name: (fictional for privacy purposes please--nothing outrageous)
Platform (Windows, Mac, Linux etc):
Operating System (XP, Mac 10 etc):
Viewing Resolution (800x600, 1024x640 etc):
Color Bit Resolution (8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit):
Browser (Netscape, IE, Mozilla etc):
Browser Version (3.0, 3.2 etc):
Highest Education:

How many years have you been using the Internet?
On a scale of 1-5 (5 being the highest-programmers etc), how would you
rate your computer literacy?

Do you visit sites such as:
- everquest.allakhazam.com/
- www.eqtraders.com/articles/news_page.php

What do you like about these sites?
What's the first thing you do upon visiting the site?
What's the first thing you look for?
Where's the first section you go to?

What features do you like about these sites?
What do you dislike?
What do you wish they had?

Rate the above 2 sites accordingly from 1-10 (10 being the highest):

General Site Features:
Site Design - (1-10)
Navigation - (1-10)
Look and Feel - (1-10)
Information Delivery - (1-10)
Advertising Ads - (1-10)
Search Query - (1-10)
Graphics - (1-10)


Why did you rate them as such? (Why did you rate it the way you
did--wether good or bad).





- Thanks again guys, I really really appreciate it.
