I think this was changed a few months ago.  While it certainly
was once true, in the past couple months I've been hit by
AOE from the named drake in CS, from the "outside the door
to HOT" dragons in ToV (as in "why didn't you mention you
were KOS!") and by a named dragon in WW, none of which
pursued me or changed faction to me after hitting me despite the
death of their targets.  Azureake in particular hit me as an
innocent bystander any number of times, no problem, and I
clearly recall some nasty incedents with him killing someone and
then starting in on me last year.
