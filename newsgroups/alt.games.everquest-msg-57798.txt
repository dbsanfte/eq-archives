Interesting problem. I think it may be something to do with 2-handed weapons
and level 16 pets. I've been hunting in Oasis for a while on TZ as a Necro,
and I recently summoned a Level 16 pet. Tried to give him a bronze 2-handed
sword, to no avail.

*shrugs* Don't ask me why, though. Maybe it's to keep them from doing too
much damage?
