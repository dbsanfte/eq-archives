That was indeed the case until recently.  Now, many elemental (or on
the cusp) raiding guilds are so sick of back-flagging that yer kinda
hosed unless you are good friends with the guild's leadership and
members.  You better be flagged before apping, otherwise they are *SO*
not interested in you.  Oh, and having a buttload of AAs helps too.
At least that latter part you can still do without raids!

Apparently, these guilds have so many folks in 'em they have no need
or plans for recruitment long term.  I can understand the loathing of
back-flagging.  I just chose the wrong time to switch chars and missed
the window.

I should say though - I dunno how it is on other servers, but that's
how it is on mine. 

No Flags?
No raiding guild for j00.

Yes, there are two sides to every story and NO, this is not a rant.
Well, not much of one at any rate.  ;-)
