As long as 85% of the people in a raid are flagged for that zone,
those that are not flagged (15%) can get in to join them. That does
not count people that are not flagged but may enter (like level 65
players) - Only those that have taken down Grummus (in this instance),
and gotten the flag that goes with it (not everyone on a Grummus raid
gets flagged due to Planer Projection despawning too fast, rezzes not
done fast enough, or someone hailing Planer Projection more than once,
etc)
