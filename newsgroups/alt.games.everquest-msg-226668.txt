I'm definitely experiencing 3) as well but I think your theory is correct.
Before last night's romp in the planes I had done an LDoN that yielded only
a few blue and was quite disappointing from that perspective. I was the
highest level in the group. Last night in PoD I got pretty decent experience
with you guys, even with Summer 5 levels below us (and that, ahem, BST above
us). What really made the point, however, is that after you all left I went
and did a quick LDoN before going to bed and wound up heading in with some
Tribulation guild guys who were at least my level and higher (55-58). I got
more than a yellow and a half on that adventure. Striking difference.
