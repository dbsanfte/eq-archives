Hmm, so the point of getting a 2hb is to get your skill up, right?  Having 
been this road, here's what I found:  What you want is a very fast, and 
-low- damage 2HB.  This way, you can beat a mob down until it turns to 
run with your best weapons, then switch and practice 2HB on its backside 
for a good long time.

I had best results with the abadoned orc shovel found as a groundspawn in 
the Lake Rathe orc camp.
