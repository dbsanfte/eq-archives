Wholeheartedly agree with that one.  The best group I've been in for LDoN 
had two Mages, a Shaman, a Necro, a Pally and me (a 55 Beastlord).  The 
Necro was played extremely well and did any necessary croud control for us 
(undead in Mistmoore).  She was slowing too, but in the end replaced her 
slow hotkey with one that said "Not going to bother slowing %T because 
it'll be dead in 2 seconds".  Between my pet proccing and biting, the Pally 
and I throwing in DD spells while meleeing, Mages nuking and the Necro and 
Shammy blasting too, it was a complete cake walk.  Mobs died so fast the 
Paladin needed a heal after every 3 kills maybe.

Same on Bertoxx.  Necros in Butcherblock generally only need to ask once.

My experience is that druids have the hardest time getting a group.  I'm 
always happy to have one, but to be honest most people are looking for the 
tank, cleric and chanty/necro first and then DPS for the other 3 spots.  I 
did complete a dungeon with a druid as main healer and didn't have much of 
a problem, and I've grouped with several as "all rounders" filling in where 
there is a shortfall.

Personally, I think in this type of dungeon with no respawns chanters have 
less value than they would in say, KC.  They make very useful group members 
and I must say that badly played chanters seem to be rarer than any other 
class, but to be honest I've been in groups where occasionally pulling 4 
has been coped with and left the cleric on 60 mana.  In that case, why not 
just fill the spot with a nuker?  I don't think many people have realised 
this yet though, as most chanters I've seen have no problems finding a 
group.  Myself I prefer to be "inclusive" and adjust the style of the group 
to suit the members, but if I wanted to complete lots of missions fast I'd 
go for DPS.
