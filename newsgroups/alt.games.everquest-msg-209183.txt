I have my mount sitting in the PoK right now on the Nameless. Didn't do
anything special, just tried to dismount once and it stood there without me.
Of course now if I am off of him, and click the drum, it says I can't have
more than one mount, and gates me over to sit on him. And I have to remember
to dismount to the side before I click on a stone, or it will leave the
mount right in front of the stone in the way of everyone else.
 Oh and then I have to put up with the newbie tells "Can I have your mount?"
"Can you sell me your mount, I have 25pp?" "Did you know you left your mount
here?"....

Bug.
