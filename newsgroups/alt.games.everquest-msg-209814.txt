Welcome to EQ the summer version. 
Kids everywhere and thats prob who you are dealing with, be patient
they tend to go away in late august. Each summer theres an explosion
of Iksar monks and assling droods but they seem to vanish till xmas
break. Even saw one monk that trained us last summer do it again this
week to my current alt, sheesh.
