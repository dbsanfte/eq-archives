I guess my viewpoint is that True Believers will generally brainwash
their children to have the same belief system, who will brainwash
*their* children to have the same belief system, etc.  In addition,
they will probably try to brainwash some of those around them.  In
effect, religion is a kind of "mind virus" that spreads.

Eventually, it spreads to someone who becomes a religious zealot,
or worse.  Next thing you know, people are flying airplanes into
buildings, declaring holy wars, or worse.  I shudder to think what
kind of horrors might await us, unleashed by people so blinded by
their religious beliefs, they don't know any better.

As soon as someone thinks they know what god is, what god wants,
and what the One True Religion is, in my mind, they become a danger
to humanity.  Perhaps not an *immediate* danger, but a danger.  In
my opinion, 9/11 should have been a wake up call to people everywhere.
Unfortunately, it seems to have made people dig in their heals into
their pet religion even deeper.

I suspect it may be advantageous to the human species to try to
encourage others to shrug off the virus.  Religion is downright evil,
in my opinion.
