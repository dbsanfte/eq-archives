I disagree... on times other than grinds (which is at it's name implies)
xp'ing can be a hoot. Especially trying to find a spot to solo in or a group
to do it with. With a ton of zones available and a countless amount of camps
in those zones, the most fun I have ever had in game is running into a new
zone and just taking a gander while half the server is /shouting about all
the wonderful new things dropping and xp/faction available.

Well... negligible contribution? Without all that 'negligible contribution'
coming from the people present, it woud be kinda pointless...

No argument there.

Having enough in-game knowledge to be able to rant and rave about it while
yer spending money every month just for the privilage?
