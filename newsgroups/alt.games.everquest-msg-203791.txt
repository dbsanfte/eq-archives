Unlike medding, that one is easily solved. ... just don't do it.

-  A friend of mine recently spent a week in Hates Fury camping a
charm, less than a month later they add the flag charms that blew all
any others away. 
- Last night I looted a pair of shaman (chain) gauntlets in an exp
group that before PoP came out woulda been NToV or Vex Thal caliber
(23ac, 10 sta, 45hp). 

With a couple of exceptions, unless  you just want the really cool
gear for bragging rights don't bother with it. It's gonna be obsolete
soon enough anyway <g>.
