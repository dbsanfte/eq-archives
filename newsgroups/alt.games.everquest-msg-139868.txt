> Kael Drakkal (all but Tormax area)

Your in a guild that kills tormy, but never been up his ramp? wow.

> Nagafens Lair (all but Naggy room)

You know, you can run in when naggy is up, and he won't kill you (you will
be ported out to LS, but at least you would see him/his room)

> Permafrost (all but Vox room)

Same as Naggy

> Plane of Air (all but Veeshan Isle)

Assuming you killed the earlier stuff (noble and other triggers) there are 2
mobs on this isle (otherwise just 1)
Hand and Eye of Veeshan.  They are giant butterflies, both DT, has a VS
style hit lifetap (1.5k or so), and melee for 500+

What a rude awakening you get on your first trip there, in comparison to the
rest of the isle!

> Plane of Hate (first floor only)

Did you go straight from a non-raid/really small guild to a large guild?
Inny is good to see, at least once (tho he does have the most trash loots
imaginable)

> Plane of Mischief (zonein area only)

its an umm.. weird zone

> Sleeper's Tomb (all)

what did you mean, you "accidently" got an ST key?

> The Deep (all but burrower area)

Thats the most fun part of the whole zone, imo
