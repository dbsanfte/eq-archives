Well Mr. know it all, what 8 spells would you mem in a group as a lvl 49
shaman?
Please list out the 8 spells. I dont want general answars. I want to know
the exact 8 spells to use.
If you cant list the spells, then obviously 8 *isnt* enough.
Anyone who wants to defend the "8 is enough" can post their answer now.
