Cry? not really.

My range slot is better, my shield is (way) better, my face is better, my
arms are equivalent, my bracer is better/same, my legs are way better, my
boots are way better, I wouldn't wear the gloves (have vindi head banked, no
motivation to complete quest due to lack of hp)

Our earrings are the same, primary slot is same, your shoulder is standing
smack in the middle of my upgrade path as soon as I get my Iceclad run done,
we both use shadel ring, and you have a ring that doesn't drop anymore, your
cloak is somewhat better than mine, your belt is nice, but I like FT.  And
with the nerfing of Affliction foci effects to not affect charm (hiss) the
hat is much less imperative for me (though I do like the hp/mana)

As for aa, /shrug.  I just want to lose the venereal title.  After that,
umm... SotW and ND3 I guess. (I notice you have ND2, checking my stats with
ND3 on magelo gives me 2328 hp, 2221 with ND2).  I'll be happy if I break 3k
hp at 65 with ND3 and Pot9.

Besides, I get major penis points for having done the utterly pointless
Beguile Plant spell quest (Hi, SoE, I want that 8 hours of my life back).
And soloing a dragon.
