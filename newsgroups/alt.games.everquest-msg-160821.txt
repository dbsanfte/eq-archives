 None of the above. I only have 3 points in General at this time and I
don't see myself putting any in there any time soon. 

 Actually, the General regen is the most bang for the buck and something
I'd probably spend points in again when I get extra. It's the ones in
Archetype (Or Class, I forget) that aren't worth it. 2/4/6 (12AA Pts)
for 3 points regen? Not worth it.
