Yes kids, it's time for Uncle Pappy's lesson on improving the english
language.

Not many know the power of the tilde (~), but did you know you can increase
your popularity and gain favor with others through the use of this simple
character?  By simply adding this character to the end of sentences, you can
wow those around you with your quick thinking and uniqueness.  Even single
words gain that extra flare with this wonderful character on the end!  Just
check out this example!:

p0wn3d~

Wow!  The mere utterance of such a powerful phrase will have every woman for
a mile swooning at your suave intelligence.  Men will covet your slick
moves.  Listen to this testimony from a level 55 rogue on Druzzil-ro:

"Before I started using the tilde, my life just seemed empty.~  Hardly
anyone even talked to me, and I never got invited to groups.~ Now I use it
on the end of every sentence, and boy what a difference!~  It has changed my
life!~"


What have you got to lose? Try a tilde today!


...catch next week's lesson where we discuss the importance of spam
inspecting people as a get-to-know-me ritual.
Stay tuned!~
