Not as common as some names, but Fox's are relatively popular animals, and
people like to make <insert-animal-here>eye(s) type names, so I wouldn't
be surprised if there other Foxeye's...I never locked the name down on all
EQ servers. Managed to in Lineage 2 on all servers available before the
beta was over. :P Foxaye...though...that's new.  Kick their butt for me if
you ever see 'em again. ^_^

I"m actually planning to change my RL middle name to Foxeye because, um,
my parents forgot to give me a middle name.  I'm so territorial about the
name I might as well give myself more ammunition.

The_Real_Foxeye: Is *your* real life name 'Foxeye'?
Imposter_Foxeye:  uhhh...no...
The_Real_Foxeye: I thought so!  Change it! Now!
Imposter_foxeye: /petition There's this really scary person...
