You need to realize that these guys have WAY more int
than they can use.  Even with max IE and PP, int maxes at
355.  Nibble Deneck, of TR (who just killed Quarm) has
322 +int on his items.  This doesn't count his base int
or int from 3pts in innate intelligence.  I'm a human
mage, with the lowest base int of any mage race.  With
that gear and aa I'd have 438 int.  You only need 325 
(VoQ gives +30 int). 

He could easily have 24 more int from maxing innate
intelligence and advanced innate intelligence (probably
take him all of a day to get the 12 aa's necessary)
