    Ha! Wizards and others were exploiting the heck out of the craptastic
pathing around the lava pool right near the zone-in. There apparently are
even safe spots there. Well, no more safe spots! Soloers like you have
ruined your own lands!

    That would have been amusing to see. ;-)

    Woo-hoo! Get out the pitchforks, it's farming time! For those not
familiar: the first round of Time is five trials. No more than 18 people may
zone into each trial, all five must be killed within one hour of starting.
They're fairly easy, as raid things go. Each trial has a boss which has a
one day respawn. If you start a trial before the boss respawns, you fight a
"Shadow of X" boss with the same abilities but no loot. So, every day, you
can farm 5 loots out of these trials. Here's the things that can drop
(random chance for one of the five, the ring and earring seem to be the
"common" drops):

    A few days ago, Time was changed so it took a 40-person raid to start
the trials. Now, with it back down to 18, people who are online early can go
in and farm up some of those things before raiding begins. I'm sure we'll
eventually have so many of those things that they'll start to rot, just like
with other Time-enabled guilds, but it still will be nice in the interim to
get people updated with items like those.

    When I read this I pictured Mike Myers in the "little kid" sketch he did
with Nicole Kidman many years ago on Saturday Night Live. I wonder if our
standard setup point is within his leashing radius....
