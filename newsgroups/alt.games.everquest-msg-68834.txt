Quite honestly I can easily believe that someone low on the totem pole
decided to go ahead & use 8.1.  After all, the previous version was
8.0a...it's not like there's going to be much difference on such an
extremely tiny version change, right?  Bug fixes in 8.0a and that's about
it, right?

Makes sense to ME anyway.  Why the hell did Microsoft choose that version
number???  If they were going to say "fuck you, Win95 users" they should
have made it 8.5 or 9.0.
