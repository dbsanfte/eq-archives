This is excellent advice with which I concur.  Ramp tank should also be 
careful not to draw aggro for the same reasons.

Well, I'm not sure I agree it's 'best' held.  DA proccing hammer 
paladins are one option, if you can sort it out.  However, rampage 
(single target) on a defensive warrior with a single shaman healing can 
be a more reliable approach.  No sudden damage from rampage at a time 
when DA has faded, no DoT landing before DA fires, and then having to 
click DA off to cure the DoT and getting rampaged, etc.

We don't have use paladins with the hammer, and we've never lost a tank 
to single target rampage or had to expend so much healing it made the 
event non-viable.  Half way through GoD and beat 4 of 6 events in 
Anguish last night.

So, good control over rampage is critical, but there are methods more 
reliable and more predictable than paladin da hammer, IMO.
