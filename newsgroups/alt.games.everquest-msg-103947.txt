I have never seen anyone be rude to newbies and not get grief on my
server. Often if someone looks lost or has a question I answer them
and hand over 1pp/level. Generally this helps at lowers. However as
soon as they beg, I get angry. I am dying to tell one to duel me and I
will give you 10pp if you can escape me. I will root them and zone.
