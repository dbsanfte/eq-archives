> why should a people move simply becuase a gov't doesn't want them there?

Well, ask all the imigrants that came over to the USA in pre/post WWII!


> sounds like ethnic-cleansing.

Moving on your own is "ethnic-cleansing" ??  Were the all the Cubans
in Miami "ethnic cleansed" ??  How about all the european imigrants
that come over to this country during the war?  They weren't too
worried about their goofy culture/country now WERE they ??? These
people cam over, worked hard, contributed a LOT, and helped make
this country the great melting pot that it is.  They valued thier
LIVES and FUTURE and DREAMS and VISION *much* more than any silly
little homeland thing.  And look at us today!  Looks that good-ole
hard work, goals/visions is a winning stragity to ME!


> isrealis and palestinians CAN live in peace.

Yea right! ...And you call yourself a realist.  Israel is no more
willing to play a target for Pali bombers than the Pali's are
willing to hang up their vests.  Peace without war is not possible
when one side wants to march the other side into the sea. Its a joke.


> 
> your solution is the weak people's solution, and the Palestinians know it.

My solution of "war" is a weak peoples solution ??  Hummm, the ole
alied forces in them Ollie North War Stories didn't look too "weak"
to me.  Need to explain that one.  So I need to ask, did you support
Hitler and the access forces like you do the Pali's ??  Did you 
happen to know that there have been MORE copies of Hitlers "Mine Kompf"
sold in the Palentianian terrories in the last 18 months than all
sales combined ??? I'll *bet* you didn't know that.
