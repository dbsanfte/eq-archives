And there is a liklihood you'd suddenly feel compelled to change if they 
stopped mentioning it? I think not.

It looks to be a dead-end either way. You won't change if they ask you 
out of principle or something... and you wouldn't even think to change 
if they don't ask.

All anybody is asking is that you hit pagedown a couple times. You take 
the time to snip and take special care to make your responses clear, but 
appear to take perverse joy in walking against traffic.

To each their own... I have yet to kill file anyone here... and I'm not 
about to start by targeting 'rabid top-posters'... but I am going to 
think its a little petty and rude. Especially since you've made it 
abundantly clear that you do it on purpose... almost in spite.
