Probably the most lucrative way to make money at low levels is to farm trade supplies such as silks and high/medium/low quality
wolf, cat, and bear skins, and then sell them IN THE BAZAAR (not to NPC vendor).  Note that you'll probably need to leave your
trader online over night to do this.

On the server I play on (and many others, I believe) spiderling and regular silks sell for 3-5pp each.  Low quality skins go for
about 5pp, medium for 8 or so, and high wolf and cat for 15pp.  high quality bear skins used to fetch 30pp or so, but I think they
may have dropped a bit to around 20pp.

A great place to farm silks is East Karana, just south of the ramp up to the Highpass zone line.  Some of those crag crawler spiders
drop up to 6 at a time (sometimes they drop none, though), and you'll be getting xp with your Shaman too, because the spiders are
about level 18-20, I think.

Good luck
