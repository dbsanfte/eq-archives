If you printed out some maps from a site, such as www.eqatlas.com, and you
are wondering about locations, type /loc in-game. You will get numbers in an
x, y, z format.

x is north/south (negative is south); y is east/west (neg is west) and z is
height.. If you have a map of your location, do a /loc and intersect the
lines of the first two numbers to find out approximately where you are.

Hint: If you do ability "Sense Heading" alot, by the time your skill gets to
around 200, the compass will actually work and not waver.
