Lady Vox Raid

** Last updated 15 June 2001

RAIDING LADY VOX - Written by Brewall Rainsinger // Bard // Cazic-Thule
Greetings all. I've written this guide to explain how a textbook Vox raid is
done. This is the compilation of my observations on both good & bad raids
and numerous "guides" that I have found that were often lacking. For many
players, dragon hunts are their first foray into large scale raids and if
you have never done one before, this guide will explain a lot of what is
going on, and what you need to do. Most of all, be patient. Pulling off a
large raid can take a bit of time, especially if the raid is short of
certain classes.

WHAT YOU NEED
1. You should be between levels 45 and 52. Clerics as low as 39 (with
complete heal) are also useful.
2. An unbuffed Magic Resistance of 50 and a Cold Resistance of 100. The
higher the better.
3. Bring two peridots: one for cleric and one for enchanter. These will be
used for beneficial spells.
4. Check with raid leader on how loot will be distributed.

HOW TO GET THERE
1. Closest Druid portal: North Karana
2. Closest Wizard portal: SE corner of West Karana
3. Timorous Deep fire pot room (-12100, 4200). The pot in the SE corner - on
the south wall - will transport you onto the docks in Halas. If you attempt
this route, just be careful of dragon that occasionally appears near the pot
room. This can be a very quick way to get to Halas if you are in near
Timorous and have access to a sow and levitate.

IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER
1. Vox is a level 55 Dragon with Cleric spells.
2. Vox's most deadly weapon is her AE cold breath and AE fear spell. Wear as
much MR/CR gear as possible; sacrifice all other statistics (yes, even AC)
to get these as high as possible.
3. Check your resist gear. If you don't have much, consider acquiring:
2xPlatinum Peridot Ring (AC4 CR10), Cloak of the Icebear (AC8 HP10 CR20),
Rune Boned Fork (MR10 CR10 FR10), Crown of the Froglok King (AC12 CR20
FR20), Velium Round Shield (AC15 CR10), and Gnomish Environmental Suit (AC9
FR10 CR10 PR10). There are a wealth of other items available, especially
with the addition of SoV.
4. Many of the mobs in Permafrost have high cold resist - including Vox, use
fire based spells where possible for minimum resists.
5. In order to cast any spell on Vox - YOU MUST BE WITHIN HER MELEE RANGE.

THINGS TO DO BEFORE RAID
Single biggest delay to raiding Vox: people not arriving on time. If there
were 30+ of the right people ready to raid, the whole thing could be over in
an hour - easy. Permafrost is in a remote location, so I recommend doing the
following, the day before the raid.
1. If you are a melee, get transport to NK/WK and get a bind in Halas.
2. If you are a caster, bind just inside Permafrost or just outside in
Everfrost.
3. Set up hotkeys for Disciplines if you have them.
4. If you have programmed any of your hotkeys to include non-critical
comments get rid of them to cut down on spam & the associated lag (e.g.
"/say I am assisting %T"). Information that is critical to battle (e.g.
Heal, Lay-on-Hands, Tash, slow) are fine.
5. Get your MR/CR gear ready in backpacks so that it is ready to equip
quickly.
6. Check with friends if they would like to attend raid. Lining up some
backups can make the difference in going ahead versus rescheduling a raid.
7. Kill Ice Giants. 3 are located outside Permafrost and others are inside
the zone. All yield decent experience and loot even for low 50s.
8. Get CR bracers. The Ice Goblin King has "Symbols of Loyalty to Vox"
bracers AC7 CR7. They aren't lore, so opportunists often stock up on them
and sell to others before the fight.
9. Get CR leggings. Elite Goblin Guards occasionally have AC8 CR5 legs.
10. If you don't have one, get a weight reduction backpack off Goblin
Archeologist.
11. Stay in the area and build factions. Kill Black Burrow gnolls for druid
& Qeynos factions. Collect teeth, and turn in 4 at a time to female warrior
near PvP area in Halas for barbarian factions.
12. Camp in Qeynos Hills for the Fishbone Earring or the Glowing Black
Stone.

STAGING PHASE
1. When you are in Everfrost or Permafrost, report in to the Raid leader.
2. The raid leader may tell if the raid is short of certain classes. Check
with friends if asked.
3. Turn off anonymous when you show up.
4. Assemble near Goblin King for temporary groups.
5. The Raid Leader, Pullers, and Group Leaders will use Shout channel. All
other communication should be on the OOC channel.
6. If you are looking for action, kill Ice Giants. These are all on random
timers and yield decent exp and loot.
7. It may take a while for the raid leader to work out final groups and the
attack plan, especially if the raid is short of people in critical areas
(clerics, enchanters, bards, nukers).


KILLING VOX'S GUARDS PHASE
1. Once enough people are present, final groups will be assigned.
2. Unless you are being directed to pull, stay in the King Area.
3. The main and secondary assists will be named. Create a hotkey for each.
4. The raid leader and backup leader will be named. Take instructions from
either leader.
5. Form into final groups. Write down all members on paper for future
reference (with so many people, it may be difficult to target someone with a
mouse, so just use the "/target [name]" command).
6. The Pullers will begin pulling the guards from Vox's chamber to the
groups. This phase is often tricky and the puller may die from inadvertent
Vox agros. All these mobs are on an approximate 4 hour timer. There will be
a countdown on each of the guards as they are killed (i.e., Pulling guard 1
of 5). When the last guard is killed, the groups will move to the safe spot
in the hallway just to the west of Vox's chambers. Once this phase starts,
please do not go go afk.
7. The raid leader will annouce "Prepare to move".
8. The raid leader will announce "Move". All groups will move to the waiting
area near the lair. If you have never been to the safe spot, DO NOT RUN
AHEAD. There are invisible pit traps that will result in a quick death in
the pits below.
9. Nuking casters will bind in the camp spot, so that in death, can mem
critical spells and jump back into the fight. In the past, players sometimes
left a couple coins on the ground to prevent empty corpses from vanishing if
dieing again. An alternate approach wass to have everyone in group create a
"/split 0 0 0 6" key, which can be used prior to someone coming back into
the fight.
10. Recomend that you go through entire attack plan and buffing information
at this point. The two key things to stress are: (1) NEVER PUSH VOX ON  A
WALL and (2) IF YOU FALL INTO PIT, STAY THERE AND DIE.

BUFFING PHASE
1. A list of casters will be named #1-14 and will correspond to the buff
number.
2. Go to your graphic and filter options and turn everything off or to
minimum (spell effects, level of detail, damage shield messages, etc).
3. All non-buffers will be stripped of all buffs.
4. Once stripped, all buffers & all bards will disband from the groups.
Temporary buffer groups will be formed. This group will move slightly up the
ramp to be easier to find. (Clarity should be kept on all buffers and teamed
with bards. If there are 2 or more necros, keep chloro and bard singing
mana/heal so that the necros can pump mana).
5. The raid leader will call out a group to get buffed. This group should
move to the buff groups and get all of the buffs listed in the next step.
Give a peridot to the cleric and the enchanter when ready for those buffs.
6. The buffs should be done in mana/time order to maximize buff time.
  #01 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist fire)
  #02 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist poison)
  #03 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. resist disease)
  #04 caster - 1 junk buff (e.g. ultravision) - rangers may want to do "call
of sky" for stun proc.
  #05 shaman - talisman of altuna - HP238 (250mana - 72min)
  #06 shaman - stamina - STA37 (~100HP) (100 - 63min)
  #07 cleric - symbol of naltron - HP525 Peridot (315mana - 54min)
  #08 cleric - shield of words - AC32 (300 - 72min)
  #09 cleric - heroism - AC20 HP400 (140mana - 72min)
  #10 enchanter - rune IV / V - DMG620/700 Peridot (350mana - 110min)
  #11 enchanter - group resist magic - MR55 (200mana - 36min)
  #12 enchanter - haste / clarity - (185mana - 16min/75mana - 27min)
  #13 druid - circle of summer - group CR45 (150mana - 36min)
  #14 druid - chloro (200mana - 15min)
  #15 open - for bard resist song
7. Note: depending on classes attending, necros can also do resist cold and
druids could do resist magic.
8. Once buffed, the group should move slightly past the buffing group,
disband, and camp out.
9. When back at the server selection screen, go to the chat area, and go to
the server chat (Cazic-Thule in my case). Wait here until someone gets on
and says everyone should log back.
10. Once everyone has been buffed, the temporary groups will buff themselves
and recover mana.
11. Someone will camp and tell the chat room that the attack will start
momentarily. Give group leaders 30 seconds head start.
12. When you log back in - turn on WALK. Vox will cast fear, and it is best
to be walk mode. If you have run mode on and vox fears you, you may wind up
in the bear pits.
13. Reform final groups.
14. Any class that has a pet should summon one.

ASSAULTING VOX
1. Only the raid leader and/or backup leader will shout attack instructions.
Smooth raids are ones where everyone knows what to do and follows
instructions.
2. RL: "Everyone move to rock!". Everyone moves up to the rock entering her
chamber.
3. RL: "Prepare for attack on the count of 3!". Bards should start to play
Elemental Rhythms with a drum (which should add approximately 71MR, 71CR,
and 71FR).
4. RL: "Main tank groups attack!". The main tank groups (1-3) will rush Vox,
activate disciplines (if you have them), surround her, and attack. Bards
will not attack with hand-to-hand (insignficant melee damage and Vox
ripostes can cause significant damage). The safest place for a bard to fight
will be directly below Vox's stomach near her hind legs. If lag is minimal
and it is possible, twist Guardian Rythms ( 71MR and 10AC), or other buffs.
5. Healers for the tank groups will remain near the rock entrance.
6. If for any reason, you get feared and find yourself in the pits, stay
there and die. Do not bring more mobs to the fight.
7. A major key to killing Vox is to not push her onto a wall. IF VOX GETS
PUSHED ONTO A WALL SHE WILL STAND THERE, HEAL HERSELF, AND SUMMON PEOPLE.
Those that are between Vox and the nearest wall should not taunt. If you are
near the wall and are the current agro, move away from the wall.

10 SECONDS INTO FIGHT
8. RL: "Enchanters dispell now!". Every enchanter should run to Vox and
dispel two times to remove all her buffs (remember to stand within melee
range). Vox has the old-world max of 32k hitpoints, and the dispels should
remove her cleric buffs and will effectively reduce her hitpoints. Each
enchanter should OOC "Dispelled" once two successful dispells are complete.
9. Once finished dispelling, enchanters should immediately begin mana
sieving her, and continue to sieve until Vox is dead.
10. RL: "Debuf now!".  Once all dispells are done, the debufs should come.
Shamans should immediately begin to attempt to slow/debuf Vox and should OOC
sucesses ("Slowed", "Malosied", etc). If any 53+ characters are present on
the raid, they can attempt to attack/debuf/slow at this time. Bards may
consider adding a debuf to twist (1 does fire resist, 1 does magic resist).
11. Necros should avoid spells that turn Vox into a skeleton. This makes it
very difficult to find the mob with so many people.
12. Healers should remain near the rock until needed. If there is only a
single person in the group taking damage, they should move back to the rock
and get a heal. This allows the healers to stay out of Vox's breath range.
If a number of people have taken damage, the healer should come to the
group. The safest place for a healer to stand is behind Vox outside breath
range.
13. Healers should pay particularly close attention to the bard in their
group. Bard resistances are preventing an enormous amount of damage, and
bards have the fewest HP of all melee/hybrids. Bards are the only class that
will not come back to the rock for healing if they are the only one taking
damage. Bards are keeping groups alive, keep them alive.
14. Healers/Paladins should call out in OOC any LoH or CH.
15. Necros should pump mana to clerics and enchanters.

AT 60% HEALTH:
16. RL: "Pets attack now!". Pets are called in to attack.
17. RL: "Tash now!". 1 enchanter should Tash Vox and should OOC "Tashed" if
successful. If Vox agros and stays agroed on the enchanter, they should not
be healed (hate will be transfered to healer and healer will die). Heal the
enchanter if they live. If agroed, the enchanter can use this opportunity to
pull Vox into the center of the room. Note: recent changes that reduced agro
from Tash may have helped reduce Vox agro - will observe next several raids
to see if any effect.
18. RL: "Stun now!". Everyone begins chain-stunning, bashing, and slamming
Vox. Although, stuns will not actually stun her, it will interrupt her from
casting heal spells. Continue to stun her until she is dead. Vox is a cleric
AI and will attempt to Complete Heal herself. If she does get one off, it is
not the end of the world, it will only heal approximately 5k of hitpoints.

AT 50% HEALTH
19. RL: "Nuke now!" Nukes and casters will be called in. Remember to get
within melee range or your spell will not land. Melee classes that cannot
cast stun should nuke as well. Nuke until Vox is dead.
20. RL: "Reserves Attack now!" Any melee groups held in reserve should
attack
21. If a caster dies, memorize critical spells and rejoin the fight. All
rezzes will be done when Vox goes down.
22. If a bard is nearly dead and cannot be healed, they can move to center
of room and suicide with Denons Desperate Dirge (Vox targeted) for 300+
damage.

AT 20% HEALTH
23. RL: "Wizards Nuke now!". Wizards are called in at 20% health for nuking.
24. Continue to mana seive, interrupt, and nuke Vox until dead.

VOX DEATH
1. Vox's corpse should not decay for 30 minutes until after she dies.
2. The group leader of the killing group should inspect the body and tell
the raid leader which items are present.  Some raids will have a trusted
member lock the corpse until the raid leader can get to the corpse.
3. No one else should inspect the body. The raid leader will loot and
distribute items.
4. All resurrections will be performed at this time. Temporary groups may be
assigned with clerics & bards to minimize time. Any bodies from pits will be
recovered at this time as well.

THE LOOT
Ah, dragon loot. What caster wouldn't want a +15wis/+15int item? What tank
doesnt want haste? Who wouldn't want a 100% weight reduction 10-slot bag
that holds XL items? Or listened to cheers as a paladin or a bard gets a
critical item in their epic quest? A staff that allows anyone to resurrect -
a fantastic raid item.

LOOT RULES
1. Depending on the raid, loot rules can differ widely. Be sure to check
before joining the raid. Some items may be claimed by the raid leader or
hosting guild.
2. Typically, each class eligible for an item is assigned a number and a
random is performed to award the item. If eligible, raid leaders and group
leaders should state which numbers they have prior to the roll.
3. Although some items are all/all, some should be restricted to benefit the
classes that could use the item the most - as opposed to being up for sale
at the EC bazaar minutes after the fight ends:
a. Runed Bolster Belt: Melees / Hybrids
b. Tobrin's Mystical Eyepatch: Casters
c. White Dragon Scale: Bards (for epic quest - only alternate source for
scale is Gorenaire). If open to all, I would suggest giving bards 5-10
numbers each, thus allowing increased odds at getting scale, but allowing
everyone else a chance as well. If another class wins the role, chances are,
it will be sold (for significant pp - on some servers over 100k) to a bard
unable to kill Vox due to level limitations. Many bards hoping to see an
epic someday are stuck at 52, unwilling to level, because Gorenaire is so
difficult to kill. Also to note, while performing the bard epic, bards can
re-spawn Trakanon, and the respawn will always drop the final epic piece + a
random breastplate. Thus, allowing a bard to loot will eventually result in
an extra bp at a later date. As a 52 bard myself, I am only a few items away
from an epic (small guild, most items from small raids), a bard with a white
scale is almost a bard with an epic.
d. Staff of Forbidden Rites: Sometimes open to all. Most people donate to
guild vault and loan to monks when raiding Hate & Fear (or other difficult
zones). In the event of a wipe-out, the monk can use to rez a cleric, thus
avoiding redoing a full break-in. Personally, I like to limit to 50+
monk/sk, and if they have it, open to all.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
It is possible for a level 53+ player to directly assist in a Vox fight, but
it is moderated by getting expelled by Vox (other than buffs prior to a
fight). If you get placed on her hate list, you will be expelled.
1. Casting a spell on Vox will cause you to get expelled. The spell may or
may not land. Spells that cause waves of damage appear to work - subsequent
to the first wave.
2. Healing people fighting Vox will result in an expulsion. The heal will
generally take, lower level heals (non-CH) will sometimes allow you to cast
more than one prior to expulsion.
3. Getting too close to Vox may result in an expulsion.  The agro radius is
quite large.
4. Some groups have used CoH (Call of Heros) to heal people. Since CoH wipes
a persons hate list, someone can be summoned, have CH cast on them, and
return to the fight. Since the hate list was cleared with the CoH, the
healer is not placed on hate list.
5. Some raids have used 53+ characters to keep any respawned ice giants from
bothering the Vox group.
