Netktopos Castle is a single-group instanced zone. The only people that are 
going to be in it are people who come in with you, so it's not surprising no 
one was in it when you went in if you went in solo. ;-) Varsoon, on the 
other hand, is an open zone where anyone can enter and multiple groups can 
congregate. Different experience. Varsoon is a fine place to grind and find 
some interesting adventures and quests. Nektropos is where you take a group 
that wants a story and a thrill, along with plenty of challenging and 
rewarding quests. The sad legacy of the Everling family and the fate of 
Maltus's six daughters is one of the more compelling sub plots in the game, 
but, like a lot of EQII, it's best enjoyed with a group.
