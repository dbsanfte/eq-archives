But Verant can ban any playter for whatever reason they want, so it doesn't
matter if they could prove it. Also, I believe we have also given them
permission to scan our hard drives if they want to (*don't quote me on
that).

You can see mobs that won't show up on track and are not visible. You can
see what loot each mob is carrying. You can see exactly where the mob is
while the Ranger is only getting "the firebeetle is directly inn front of
you" (or however the message reads), the accuracy of which is determined by
tracjing skill.

Because the invisible mobs that will agro you and you autotarget are a
different breed than Pain and Suffering. Anyone who hunts in FoB will
quickly learn that some mobs will go beneath the world. These mobs are now
invisible to you but, because they ignore the z-axis, they can agro you and
you will target them as if they were right in front of you; you just can't
fight back. Mobs like Pain and Suffering aren't really mobs in the sense
that you can fight them and gain exp, nor can you track them or see them
with see invis. But because they are zone entities they will show up on
ShowEQ.

Maybe he doesn't want to get banned and therefore won't use ShowEQ.
