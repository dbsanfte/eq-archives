Richard, it appears that some people do not have a problem for some
reason. I don't know if it's due to expansions or models or what that
might cause an increase in traffic for those that do, don't
know.....but I run firmware 1.40.1 and have tried several suggestions
from linksys tech support and I still get disconnects.  I finally took
mine out of the network and use it for a paper weight. If you just
bought yours, take it back and get a Netgear or something.  It's not
worth the trouble, and it will ALWAYs disconnect at the worse possible
moments !
