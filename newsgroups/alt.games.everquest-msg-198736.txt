Well, The Other John, I think you misunderstood his post.  He was
complaining about the possible restrictions on high level spells.  You seem
to be for them.

I agree with YOU 100%.  I pesonally endorse the restrictions for various
reasons mostly to keep lower levels spells and buffs worth something.  Yes,
clarity and the bard's equivalent will still be very important in groups of
similar level players.  My personal preference (I'm not saying I'm right,
it's just my preference :) is to not make power levelling so easy.  I think
players should have to do the same amount of work to achieve similar results
instead of some players twinking and paying for power levelling while others
work their way up.
