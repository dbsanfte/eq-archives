I think it happens if at the exact time they go to create their
character with your name you are link dead or inbetween zones and for
some reason the server does not have you down as existing.
Circumstances must have to be exactly right because it hardly happens.
Of course its far more likely to happen to you, and I hear of it
happening far more, if your name is the correct spelling of a
fictional character. Many a Gandalf, Strider, Drizit or what have you
probably have had this happen to them. If your name is "Fpinglez" or
something else you just made up the odds are pretty astronomical of it
happening unless you have an enemy on your server with a whole lot of
free time and they get very lucky.

Consider yourself lucky if all you can do is not log in because of
this. In the early days of EQ (possibly only the beta) when this
happened they could log in later and BE your character while you were
a level 5 rogue going "WHAT THE HELL?"
