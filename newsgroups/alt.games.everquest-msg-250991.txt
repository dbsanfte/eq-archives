Not at all. Smoking tobacco is legal (only *where* it can be 
smoked is regulated), and it can hardly be said to be encouraged 
at any level, except from the tobacco companies themselves.

/shrug. It happens already with tobacco, but it's hardly a big deal.

There is certainly an ethics issue there, which is, what right 
does the government to regulate the substances I choose to take? 
It most certainly has a right to make sure I don't drive or 
operate heavy machinery under chemical influence, but that's a 
completely separate issue.

For the record, I don't even drink alcohol, so my views on the 
issue are entirely political, not personal.
