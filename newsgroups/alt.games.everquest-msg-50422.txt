Damage from a DoT works if the MoB is rooted or chasing you. Rooting it
allows you to meditate some mana back easier. Root Doting is a great tactic
because after you finish off the MoB you are close to full mana again and
ready to go. Nuke kiting will take the MoB out faster but you will have long
meditate after the fight to get your mana back. Also Nukes tend to be
resisted more in my experience. Specializing in Conjuration is good for DoT
kiting. However Evocation is great for Quad kiting which becomes available
to Druids at level 34 with Lighting Strike. I specialized in Alteration and
have no trouble doing either kinds of kiting or grouping. Specialization is
a little over rated IMHO. Does very little in the way of making more mana
available to you.
