PvP doesnt suck in EQ, its just an acquired taste (imo). Good thing is,
if someone doesnt acquire the taste, they don't have to participate.

The thing about PvP in eq is that a lot of the time the outcome is
situational. Even the terrain can affect PvP in one way or another. And
the risks for PvP (esp. on servers like rz, sz) tend to be very high. A
lot of people have complained about how PvP favours one class or
another, how it favours pk's, how it favours this and that etc etc, but
in reality its the person behind the keyboard thats at fault 99% of the
time.

Some people just dont get it that you should wear PvP gear (resists!!)
when travelling. They don't get it that they are at risk ALL the time.

I have payed the price for being a pk (so much for reputation doesnt
matter), i couldnt join a planar group if i wanted to. I couldnt get a
group in a dungeon if i wanted to. I get attacked by random people far
more than any non-pk. I have to use a mule to buy/sell/trade gear.

Pvp is actually quite in-depth in eq, but most people just dont bother
to learn it. Why arent most sk's running around with those sk-only CH
wands? Ive only found a couple of sk's who even use them, ever. Why
arent people wearing resist gear so that they die MUCH? Why dont they
learn about dot slots and pumice? Why dont they buy eqq shaped pumice or
camp golem wands? Why dont they know how to jboot cast spells? Why dont
they use low delay melee weaps on casters? Why do they just try to jam
their gate button as soon as PvP is initiated? Why dont they learn what
spells are useful and which arent, in PvP (wizards trying to use those
always resisted stun spells come to mind)? Why, why, why? Because they
havent bothered to learn about PvP, and just blame Verant, pk's, server
rules and anything else they dont directly control, in an effort to
escape the blame for their own shortcomings.

I learnt all of that stuff, and strive to learn all I can about PvP.
People who dont do that, lose, if they decide to come to a PvP server.
