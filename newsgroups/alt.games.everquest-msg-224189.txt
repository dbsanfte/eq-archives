I used to keep up on what various high-end guilds were doing, but so
much has changed since Time was breached and LDON came out, and most
of the sites I used to visit seem to be dead.

Fires of Heaven -- Site down
Triton -- No update since fanfair pic
Afterlife -- One good LDON update recently, that's heartening
  http://www.afterlifeguild.org/
H&E -- Killed Quarm late last month, nothing since
  http://www.hneguild.com/

So, where do you go for news of the big doings in EQ? What guilds are
kicking high-end content's collective, virtual butt these days? Does
anyone chronical all of it in one place?
