Say something.  You only split with /split on, and it bites.  It doesn't
do it fairly.  Plus, in PC, you're missing our on Bronze chain armor
which sells for a couple of plat a shot.

Before anything else, you must say something.  If it doesn't change
after that, leave.

Casters have to med during and after fights, and as a result it's
harder to get to bodies, this is an oft heard complaint.

As far as being only healer - this isn't so if another priest is in
camp.  Druids are healers, buffers, nukers, dotters, evaccers.  Their
are many roles you can play.

If you become cash poor, and just need cash (this will not get you
much xp) go to West Karana and find a bandit camp.  At 23 you can
single pull them.  They drop bronze weapons (several GP each) and
bandit sashes (turn them in in Qeynos for cash and a reward you
can sell).  With a druid I'd bind near the bandits (outside of 
aggro range) and use you 19 ports to get to a city to  sell and 
gate back.
