Agree strongly. Starting out, Maik, you'll have plenty on your hands
learning the game mechanics without also learning the magic systems
and other arcane stuff. "Whacking things with a stick" is a pretty
familiar concept, so you won't have to learn what your character does
as well as how to play the game.

It takes a while to get the hang of the game mechanics, but I assure
you it's worth the effort. You can have lots of characters, so any
time you decide to want a wizard or a druid or whatever, you can fire
one up without losing your existing character.

One more thing to add - when starting your first character, don't
choose Human. Unless something has changed, they're pretty much
completely night blind which can be frustrating.

Again, Graefaxe is wise.
