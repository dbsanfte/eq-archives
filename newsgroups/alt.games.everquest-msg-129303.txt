"/serverfilter on" causes the server to perform the filtering out of text
that you don't want, as opposed to having your local machine to that
filtering, so, it does indeed help in reducing the network traffic.  The
only other setting I am aware of is the one already mentioned, which is in
datarate.txt.  I don't claim to know how it is used exactly, just that I
understand that for a broadband connection you want it set differently than
for a modem connection.
