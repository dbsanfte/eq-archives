Done it.

The response wasn't as gratifying as I thought it should have been.

Though one of the best along this line was:

Hanging out in North Ro.
SomeGuy: "Can anyone port me to WC?"
SomeGuy: "Can anyone port me to WC?"
SomeGuy: "Can anyone port me to WC?"
SomeGuy: "Can anyone port me to WC?"
ARandomRespondent: "Why don't you walk?  It's only two zones away, by the
time you get a port, you'll be there."
SomeGuy: "I want a port.  I'm encumbered."
Me: /who SomeGuy = an 18 Paladin.
Me: /who porters in zone = None (myself, at the time too low to carry
passengers)
Me: /who = 20 people, NO anons
AnotherRandomRespondent: "And we want you to stop bothering us with your
shouts."
SomeGuy: "Can anyone port me to WC?"
Me: "If you spent the energy you have in shouting to bother doing a /who,
you would know that there aren't any porters here.  No WALK you lazy
Paladin."
Miscellaneous people in zone responded with various "LOL"s and "Yeah"s, etc.
