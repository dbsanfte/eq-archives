Just to be clear here, the 255 I was speaking of was for the highest of
INT/WIS in order to get skillups.  I have heard of the 252 skill cap, when
counting in +skill% modifying items.  Basically, make a bunch of items that
are just trivial, or barely trivial, and check the success rate.  Compare
that success rate to the most generally accepted formula for success rate,
and deduce from that what the skill cap is.  There is still some
disagreement as to whether it's 252, 254, or 255, but 252 seems to be the
most generally accepted skill cap.
