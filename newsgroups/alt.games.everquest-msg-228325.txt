Not sure I agree with this, completeley.

I would bet (a small amount ;p), that you could buy GOOD quality components,
have a better pc and still save some cash.

Bonus for pre-built ?

Warranty
Customer service
Guarenteed replacement parts for x years for x amount.
No faffing about building the thing...

Bonus for build ya own?

Seperate parts USUALLY have warranty (bust it putting it in, send it back
say it was already borked ;p).
You will know your pc
Cheaper (maybe only slightly, but in comparison to the parts in the
pre-built, quite a bit cheaper)
Better quality and faster.
