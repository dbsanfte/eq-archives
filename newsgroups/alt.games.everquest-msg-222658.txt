Competition would give us:

Lower prices for Microsoft Client/Server licenses for a start.

An internet browser that wasn't a bloatware piece of garbage, one that 
is extremely insecure and unreliable, one that likes to install software 
with only a minimal warning (shockwave? bonzi buddi? gator?) The browser 
alternatives (Mozilla, Opera, Safari are lightyears ahead of IE... but 
still 90%+ use IE because its a Microsoft bundleware.

An email client that doesn't automatically open spam and virii by default.

An OS that doesn't have ports that only a few users need open by 
default, ports that are vulnerable to a self-propogating worm where the 
user only needs to be connected to the internet to be exploited.

And the list goes ever on...



What does interoperability give us:

Interoperability in an actual competitive market would ensure you didn't 
go out of business.

Imagine the car maker that makes a gas guzzling vehicle that is wider 
than the road. Now imagine that company charged a huge price for that 
too? Sure they might move a few units (Hummer H1 anyone?) but they would 
never be able to move a large number of units unless they 
conformed...(and voila we have the much more 'normalized' Hummer H2).
