I'm sure it has, but Dick Correa has about four posts to his entire
usenet career and suddenly seems to be on a holy crusade to answer
every post Bob makes. It was enough to make me wonder what exactly has
Dick's dick in a knot too.

Ah, just what I was just posting about....


> Why are you on your crusade to be the EQ2 stooge?

In other words, you are upset someone is posting EQ2 info in a
newsgroup meant for rpgs?

Who are you again to be telling people what they can or cannot post?

He answered his points elsewhere. I have to agree with Bob, Dick
sounds like a hater, and that's coming from someone who is not seeing
much in the way of positives about EQ2.
