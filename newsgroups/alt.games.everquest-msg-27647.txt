Time out for funny story.

Remember the "aaaaaaaaaaaaas youuuuuuuuuuuuuuu wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish" "oh 
my poor sweet westley!" bit?  where they both go careening down the hill?  
Well, I was on a hike with a couple of friends when they decided to try 
this trick down a hill.

A hill full of cactii.

I almost wet myself when I heard them yelling "aaaaOWaaaaaaaOW 
CACTUSssssss youuOWOWOWuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu OW wiiiiiiiOWiiiiOWshOW!"
