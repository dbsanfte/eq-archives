Power supply was the first thing I thought of until this paragraph.

Just because you clean the CDs doesn't mean the CD-ROM drive magically gets
clean.  It's probably filthy.  You can try a CD-ROM cleaning kit, though the
one and only time I used one my CD player no longer worked at all. :p

Since I'm sure you only allow your kids to use the computer with your
supervision, perhaps it's time to either watch & teach them how to handle
CDs correctly, or ban them from putting them in at all (you do it).
