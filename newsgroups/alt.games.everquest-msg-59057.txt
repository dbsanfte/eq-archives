Please ask how they did it.  I'm serious, always looking for places to
get a quick bit of exp between raids, and it's pretty much on the way
to ToV.

Yeah, assuming our dispell didn't have a pretty lame range, and that
there weren't two of them, and that they didn't have a ton of hit
points and that they seem to be perma-sowed, and that they didn't
summon, they might be doable.  As it is now I'm gonna have to call
bullshit on this one.  Bards are powerful when played well, but we're
not fucking necromancers or anything.  :)  They can't be charmed, and
they're tough to mezz, and have very high MR, so I can't see any way
to kite them, unless it's something really odd like a tash-stick and
fear pants, and a pathing bug.

I think I'll just bring a full group with a porter.  Are you sure your
bard friend wasn't talking about PoM?  That is soloable by a bard,
though it's probably much easier to take a death and a rez than trying
to get another CoH back in.  (At 60 though I'm gonna do the damn NToV
run just to say I've done it.)
