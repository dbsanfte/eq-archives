*chuckle* My point is, Just Jekke, that the luclin models are not gorgeous
women...they are deformed versions of gorgeous women.  What you describe
up there is the ideal...but I'd like to venture that it's more than just
the breast and waist that is involved.  That the curve of the leg...the
grace of how a woman holds herself...the smile in her eyes...heck, a
pretty face...these are just as important.  And these ARE NOT in luclin
models.  IE, the lady who was in charge thought all she had to do was
stick big boobs on some skinny legs and she had males pegged. 

WARNING: Don't read on if you don't like women talking a little crude.

It's demeaning to men...heck, why not stick two bags of jello on a couple
of wooden sticks and a spot where you can rut...that's enough for you
guys, eh?  Sure she's scowling at you all the time (the angry, snotty
expressions on a high elf woman's face would make me shrivel up fast if I
were a guy), that's what those handmade backpacks are for...just slip it
right over her head.

No, I like to give most males a little more credit for their aesthetic
sensibilities.

Naw, no worries.  I may get psycho about things like the S-DMCA, but I'm
fairly content with my own vanity.  Obviously I _am_ vain, becuase I
wouldn't care about this otherwise.

Oh, and in response my husband sarcastically thanks you for calling him a
liar and making judgements on what he thinks without having met him. :P
