I felt sucked in for the first 3 months as there is so much to do and see
but then realized there isnt so much to do other then
kill this, kill that move on to the next thing to kill. The first 10-15
levels was more about discovering your character, your surroundings, and
quests you need to do. Once you get above 15 the quests start to thin out,
you have to pick where to go that fits your level, and you start farming
certain spots to get the needed experience and/or loot.

The skill system is a neat item but since the game has been around so long
it is somewhat optional. There are plenty of vendors that can sell most
items you can make so its a matter of wether you want to spend the time
(alot of time to develop skills such as brewery, tailoring etc.)

Lots of quests but finding ones that suit just your class/race really puts
limits on quests you can do

If you like social type games and can find a steady group to play with its a
blast

I work varied hours and could never really run with the same crowd so I
ended up soloing a lot which ruined the game fast for me

I paid $12.95 in the US

We have evolution in the US which has all 5 expansions (except Lost
Dungeons) for $29.95 - people who started from the beginning have paid well
over $200 for same package so for $30 and 1 free month you cant lose to at
least experience it
