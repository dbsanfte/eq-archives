Someone already answered this, but I'll add that the lich line is also
much more efficient in the amount of HP for mana, but you can't get back
mana as fast as you can with a shaman.

Before he got Torpor he always did it.  I've heard that SOE "recognizes"
and gives their blessing to the dance, and so they may very well set the
mana cost on shaman spells to balance against canni-dancing.  The shaman
that I've met that don't dance are usually one-trick-wonders with slow and
buffs, because that is all they have mana to handle.  A shaman who pushes
themselves can do slow, healing, buffing, nuking/dotting, pulling, and
crowd control.  

Here is a general comment about the class as well.  The shaman is a lot of
work, and in this day and age, the pay-off for the effort is not what it
used to be.  If you want raw killing power for your effort, there are
better classes.  Shaman reign neither in soloing, grouping, nor raids.  
They do OK, they are not at the bottom of the barrel, but the effort to
power ratio is somewhat discouraging.  Part of the reason for this is that
what a shaman does best is endurance fights, and, well, PoP and LDoN are
all about "Kill it fast! Kill it now! Better yet, kill it 5 seconds
ago!".  

However...there *is* one area that a shaman shines like a beacon, where no
other class can beat them yet, and that is duos.  No class can do so much
when you add any other second class to them.  If you like to duo, you'll
be glad you made a shaman. :)
