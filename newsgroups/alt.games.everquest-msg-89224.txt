I managed to get my ranger up to 35.  I went and got my Riposte
(USEFUL!), and my Disarm skill (USELESS!). And that spellbook can kiss
my hairy ass too.  ;-)  

But anyway....

I managed to get my Disarm maxed out, or at least to 55 which is what
the Rangers Glade says is max, and I was just wondering, how much hate
does trying to disarm an NPC generate?  Seems like it might be a nice
skill to use if you have a main tank taunting, just on the off chance
that it will work, unless it will generate so much hate that my ranger
will end up paste.
