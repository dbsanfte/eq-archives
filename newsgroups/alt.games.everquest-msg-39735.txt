Sure does. So why does it suck more for a character able to get
experience from the camp than it would for a high level farmer? At
least the low level *is* getting experience.

These are level-appropriate items, don't forget. There is still higher
level stuff available for sale by higher level players, and the
infinite supply will affect TCC item prices and availability just like
it does everything else.

We're not talking about EQ2. We're talking about the game we're
playing today.

High levels relying on high levels. Or stated more clearly, level-X
characters relying on other level-X characters in the zone. 

I've played on several *new* servers where I was one of the high level
characters, and there wasn't anyone around to "save my bacon". Know
what? The game is still perfectly playable.

Resurrections are *never* required. They are greatly desired, but that
is not at all the same thing.

*Anyone* can find and report a zone bug. Once it's known and/or
corrected, the level of the person who reported it is irrelevant. So
this argument against TCC only applies to the first case.

Agreed. But this isn't precisely a role-playing factor, as
role-playing rests entirely with the player (and damn few of them
bother). It's more of a logical consistency, or immersion factor.

This isn't a problem with the concept of TCC, but rather with the
implementation. The cats shouldn't give you the quest if you're not of
an appropriate level. Agreed, it's a problem, but let's put it in the
proper light.
