I've missed alot of this thread, but just to comment on the AC, I've
never 'camped' him.  I have, however, been known to bind in areas that
had MOBs I wanted and occasionally pop in to have a look, if not
there, wonder off to do other things. I will admit that this does not
usually pay off within hours or even a few days, but over time it
works out.  Especially if you logon and check during 'off' times.
Using this method on the AC has caught him for me 3 times in the last
month.  Killed him the first time, KS'ed the second :( ,  and he
killed my lower level the third....but I'll get him next time.......
