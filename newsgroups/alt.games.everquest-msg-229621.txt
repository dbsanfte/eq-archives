All of that is interesting, but I think the challenge has been made to 
actually name newsgroups (preferably ones in the interest areas you just 
recited) in which a demonstrable preference for top posting is prevalent.

Bizbee's main thrust wasn't that you don't post anywhere else, but 
rather that you haven't presented evidence that indeed, on most of those 
other places you (hypothetically) post, top posting is the norm.

No need to reveal what your identity on those other newgroups is if you 
are reluctant to mix such things (maintaining 8 or 9 addresses tends to 
indicate you care enough about that to make an effort), just naming them 
would be a good start.

Splendid
