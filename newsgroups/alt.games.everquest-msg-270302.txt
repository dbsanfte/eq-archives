But if you don't defeat them all, maybe their remaining friend(s) help
them recover, while if you take them all out you can take the time to
finish them all off.  I'm not sure I really agree that's how it should
work, but it seems a reasonable in-game explanation that achieves the
goal of forcing you to deal with the whole encounter if you want the
reward.

LoY had, I think, two raids (Captain something in Hate's Fury,
Innoruuk in Crypt of Nadox), that's fewer than any other expansion.
It was for mid-level players, mostly, with nothing except frogloks,
dyes, maps etc for those below 30 and little else for those above 60
(except soloers who may have found use for the high-50s mobs, I don't
know).  It didn't seem like people went there much, though, no matter
what level they were, until it became a hot spot.

I really really wish they had done more with faction in EQ2, and EQ1
as well.
