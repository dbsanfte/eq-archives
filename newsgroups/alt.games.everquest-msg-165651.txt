Really?  Let's see, in your other post you stated that the USSR
was an empire because they had "rather an assload of conquered
territory".  Am I to infer from these two posts that it is the
relatively recent conquest by the USSR that distinguishes them
as an empire, in opposition to the earlier conquest and
colonization of the portion of North America that makes up the US?
Not that much more recent tho, we did most of it in the 19th
century.  Seems rather a shallow and arbitrary distinction.
