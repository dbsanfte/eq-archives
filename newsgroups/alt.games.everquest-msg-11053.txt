I have never had this work.  I either sit and camp if I am not aggro, or if I
am, hit DA and /q which will sometimes work

The problem is, sitting will often aggro mobs and DA is 6 seconds shorter than
camp cycle (on purpose I would assume) so as a practical matter, you are
vulnerable 8 seconds or so.  Most often you will get hit in that 8 seconds if
you are going to aggro them by sitting, so DA does no good.  Tthe problem is,
you won't find out really if you are okay until 25 seconds have passed by, and
your chance of doing DA and /q are substantially less.  If you quit out, you
have to outlive tanks who are still fighting and have the quit hit before you
are dead.

So my routine is sit and camp, and if I get stood up, DA and /q.  Sometimes
when I am quite sure I will get hit, I DA and /q immediately.
