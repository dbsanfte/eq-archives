Wurmslayer (25/40) and jagged longsword (16/30). I wear Indicolite
breastplate and boots (hateplane) the rest is crafted. Spider fur belt and
collar, hooded black cloak, 6ac questmask from IC, 6/65 rings, cougar
earrings. Cobalt boots are only slightly better than indi, so Im looking at
gaunts and arms right? Thats 11k. Say i keep longsword for offhand (its
actually better than lammy in offhand) i still have 9k to spend. So, do i
get FBSS or fast 1hander now?
