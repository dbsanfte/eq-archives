Yes, it does, and I'm not sure I like it...

I tried DAoC when it was released, and trust me, I wanted to love it
becuase at the time I was really against EQ.  However I came back and
I have since realized what aspects of EQ I preferred.

One thing that bothers me about EQ2 is the fact that items will wear
out.  In DAoC, this was nothing but a pain in the ass.  Also, DAoC
had items that, if used by too low a character, would not be as
effective or perhaps even break.  This also was a PITA.  I mean,
why would you want to go through hell and back to get your epic
(or some other uberitem) only to have it degrade into useless trash
with nothing you could do about it?

These two concepts are fairly major in the impact they would/will
have on the game.  I hope that Verant does not make the same mistakes
that caused so many DAoC players to return to EQ.

Mike
