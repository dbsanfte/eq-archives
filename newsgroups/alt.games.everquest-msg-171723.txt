Well, an active GM can deal with that be acting as the sole source of
"buyable" scrolls, but yeah that is a real problem.  I had forgotten
about it because my friends and I noticed that stupidity right away
and just shied away from scroll use via UMD.  Heh, it was so absurd
that we rejected it as an "exploit" and promptly forgot about it.

That would be cool, as long as the misfire had a substantial chance of
being lethal even to the 155hp Barbarian trying to abuse the system :)

Shocking how some people just won't get with the program eh?  Next
we'll read about how some philistine out there doesn't think it's
appropriate for a L8 Wizard to have +240 mana and +14/tick mana
regen.
