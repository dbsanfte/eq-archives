As a mage, I like to pretend my elementals don't die -- they just
go back to air, earth, fire or water planes (whichever they came
from).  I like to think that by summoning them, I'm giving them an
exciting and rewarding experience they can take back to share with
other elementals.  And lastly, I like to think I'm giving them xp.
So they go back tougher and can show off to their friends.  :)
