Not sure what Extended Blessing is.

I can say for certain however, that buff extending foci from potime (the
zone its from is generally irrelevant) will increase heal over time
durations, and stacks with both SCR, and SCRM

As long as the limitations on extended blessing are short enough to include
HoT spell durations, yes it would stack. (A lot of the extended buff foci
are for spells like 42 or 48 seconds+ in duration)
