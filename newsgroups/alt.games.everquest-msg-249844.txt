And where do you think any call volume concerning the gaming account
is going to go? To SoE? No.. to the bank.

And you should get no more traffic through this system then you do
from a regular banking system. And banks allready have CS setup to
handle traffic for both accounts and fraud claims. Adapting them to
handle gaming accounts is simply a matter of training the current
personnel to the new requirements.

I do agree they can't do a half-assed job of it and expect it to flow
smoothly. But if they actually design the system and implement it
patiently, it should work rather well.
