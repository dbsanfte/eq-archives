I should say, this particular subthread with DT was about copyright 
violation in particular.

Well, it's about that, and whether or not selling plat is duplicating it. 
:b

As to the legality of selling the plat and items in general, I can't say 
that I am fully convinced that it is ilegal.  Whether or not the click 
through EULA is truly binding has not, to the best of my knowledge, been 
actually tested in court.  Whether it is actually ilegal or not, it does 
clearly violate what each and every player agrees to abide by when they 
play the game.
