I don't like onions because they're crunchy... but I like potato chips.

I don't like tomatoes, because, well... they taste bad. -But I like tomato
sauce and ketchup.

I don't like Snickers candy bars because they're too sweet... but I like Key
Lime pie.

Not everything is rational or logical. I have absolutely -no- rational
opinion as to why I dislike onions, tomatoes, and Snickers bars... in fact,
they're all contradictive. My point? I don't like them... because. <shrug>

Human opinions aren't logical to begin with. So we all respect each other's
limits and tastes... when I go to a friend's house, they all know that I
hate various things for odd reasons, so they don't serve them. When a guest
is over, I ask what they do and don't like before microwaving something for
them (note that I could burn a bowl of cereal). It's a courtesy we all pay.
