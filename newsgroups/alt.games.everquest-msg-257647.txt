I think Ben secretly wants to play the long defunct (if it was ever more 
than a pipe-dream in the first place) Dawn.

Single character server, completely open PvP, and permadeath.

Give players -all- the tools to sort out behaviour problems and see if

FWIW i would very much have liked for someone to make a 'Dawn' game. But 
then I like experimental sociology too ;)
