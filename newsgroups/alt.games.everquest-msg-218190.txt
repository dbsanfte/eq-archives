You really should rethink that one. It really is a pretty dramatic
increase to mana regen for a shaman since we're almost never medding
anyway. Think of it as better than a permanent KEI in outdoor zones. 

Mobility really isn't a problem IME, you can either make a /dismount
hotkey or just click it off. ... and with our insta-click sow it's
trivial to always be running at max speed anyway. 

Obvious upgrades that I can see:
- Kylong Darkmain guantlets and girdle
- Bloodmetal earing
- Death Mask of the Elysians (marginal upgrade) or a new mask dropping
in LDoN (everfrost) that's something like 10ac, 45hp. ... don't
exactly recall stats, I lost my only roll on one. 
- Valorium ring
- Drape of the proud

Honestly though, it looks like good gear for that level, other than a
lizard I don't think I'd worry about equipment too much at this point.
You're at the point where you need to start worrying about spells,
even if you decide to skip malo and torpor and go straight for the lvl
65 versions.
