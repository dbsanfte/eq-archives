I'll go further and say that not only is he 100% unquestionably wrong, 
but that the inverse is 100% unquestionably right. If tradeskills were 
profitable there would be MORE incentive to create macros for it.

As it is, people macro tradeskills because they want to be able to go 
through the work of finding and making high level stuff and macroing can 
relieve some of the tedium. But for all that not that many people really 
care if they personally can make the items... most of us know someone 
who will do the combine for nothing anyways, and be grateful for the 
free components and a chance at the skill up.

But if it were profitable, nearly everyone would have incentive... we 
ALL have a use for plat to some degree. Whether its loading up tribute, 
buying tradeskill components, horses, twink gear, or whatever...

That's only theoretically true. The only games that actually have bots 
than can play as well as the average player are games with small 
accessible problem spaces and simple rulesets (e.g. chess) or the bots 
are cheating grossly, outright playing under relaxed rulesets, to keep 
up. Most Quake bots for example don't have to have you in their field of 
view to "see" you.

While it might be possible that with enough time and skill a bot can be 
made to play any game as well as people playing by the same rules as the 
people, in practice its not a generally solveable problem... we 
apparently don't have enough time or skill to actually do it.

And yes, the devs *are* deliberately ensuring that building useful bots 
requires reasonably high amounts of time and skill ... or at least more 
than a gamepad with autofire. IMO that's a good thing.
