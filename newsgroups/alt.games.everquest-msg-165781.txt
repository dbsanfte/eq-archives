Sanjian was arguing in terms of absolutes.  I looks to me like I made
it pretty clear that that would not get him where he wanted to go.  In
the context of what I was replying to my questions are very relevant.

Well, you've been pretty consistent in your last few answers, but I
suspect you might find yourself very unpleasantly surprised when
the application of absolutes to human affairs is carried to its
logical conclusion.

Well, given that jailors allow non-convicts (visitors, lawyers, police
officers) in and out of the jail on a routine basis your justification
for calling my statement idiotic appears to have evaporated.  Care to
try again?  Or are you prepared to agree that it is a good thing that
jailors discriminate between those people who are to be jailed in
accordance with accepted legal procedure and those who are not?  If
you need just a bit more convincing, one of the nicest things about
being an American, as opposed to let us say an Iraqi, is that I can be
reasonably confident that the jailors here will in fact be aware of
and in compliance with accepted American legal procedures for said
discrimination.

Agreed.  Or, to avoid the foolishness inherent in absolutes, work to
ensure that they have equitable opportunities, since family background
prevents you from guaranteeing equality.  And don't forget to maintain
our existing mandate that they be equal in the eye of the law.

Again, life.  I live in an allegedly liberal and progressive city, in
a state well known for its liberal politicians and social programs.
And yet I find myself surrounded on all sides and in all the social
circles I am or have been part of, by racists mild and extreme.
Racism is ingrained into our culture(s), a few decades of legislation
is hardly sufficient to do more than partially submerge it.  What
sucks is that it is almost completely taboo in public debate, except
for the occasional accusation of racism against particular persons, and
some boilerplate mouthed by politicians in a way that is far more an
observance of ritual than a position of substance.

Well goodie for you.  And, of course, everybody thinks and believes
exactly as you do.  Except for maybe that pack of black kids who
chased me when I was a teenager.  And then there're the crackers
burning down black churches from time to time.  And the comfortable
white suburbanites quietly urging their neighbors who are moving
away to not sell to <those> people.  And the white folk passing
around invented tales of Hmong capturing and eating their neighbors
pets.  And all the kids running around in their racially segregated
packs.  And ...

As for me having no problem with discrimination, I'll wait until
you understand the incompatibility between your assertion that
you have no problem arguing from absolutes, your apparent belief
the "discrimination" (note the total lack of qualifiers, exactly
as you used the word) is wrong, and your agreement with the
assertion that it is proper to discriminate against convicted
felons in the case of permitting ownership of firearms.  Then I'll
be happy to discuss and/or debate that particular topic with you.
Until then it is clear that you do not understand what I've written
well enough to have any clue what I do or do not have a problem with.

Kaev
