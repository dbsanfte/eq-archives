In -all- ways?  Well, heck, next time I better not open it to a roll when 
it becomes an issue. :)

And you're right, next time we won't 'string him along' with lots of exp 
he wouldn't presumably otherwise be getting, and a significantly better 
shot at any chain that might possibly drop, and tell him 'no, sorry, 
guild group' from the get-go.

Of course, that strategy worked horribly in Paludal... Dang rogue hung 
around for an hour hoping we'd change our mind when we saw how much DPS he 
could do, then got all pissed off when we -still- said no.  It probably 
didn't help that our collection of twinks was flying a fairly random 
assortment of guild flags at the time, heh.
