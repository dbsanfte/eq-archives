Shrug. I and my friends have heavily twinked one level 9 and lightly (very
lightly) twinked a few more. We went to level 9 because one is playing
a shaman and, well, living without sow would be horrible.

We're going to explore, experience the moons content at the low levels
we missed cause we were all level 60 already and so on. 

Our mains are staying with our friends and guilds on our normal server,
and we're taking the little kitties to roleplay fool around die horribly
and see if the GM roleplaying is all its cracked up to be.

If someone did this to me on legends OR on terris thule you'd be damned
right in thinking I'd roleplay with them till they had to go do something
else ;) Far too few people bite when I start roleplaying, I'd be treasuring
someone starting off unpromtped.

And no, by roleplaying I dont mean appending "ith" or "Thee" or "thouh"
to every sentence.

"Minest sword is subparith. Can you spare me thous firey defender?" is not
roleplaying. Ugggh.

Sui, who roleplays always and somtimes notices people haven't realised
