yep good point.   in addition to casting ensnare (and re-casting if needs
be) you should always keep on taunting too.

An alternative (or tactic for higher mobs) snare the mob, then let your
boyfriends wizard get big agro (maybe even him casting the snare: atols
spectral shackles) then he runs around, while you chase the mob hitting from
behind.  If you get agro, then he simply re-nukes/re-snares.. you should be
able to fight it, taking little-no damage
