Hall of Testing mobs (what CoV people kill) don't run, unless you count
the ones that can gate.  Two mobs at once can be surviveable (raid-wise)
if one mob doesn't AoE-- moreso if the AoE-caster isn't a cleric.  That
has been my guild's experience.  The raid party's discipline has to be
really good, though.
