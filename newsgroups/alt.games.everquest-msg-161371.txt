The low level mage came down off his high and he was hurting.He ported to
the nexus and sat with the other KEIheads huddling in the close warmth of
the other pain ridden squabble of addicts.The cry of "donation for KEI" was
often and almost obnoxious.Other players walked by almost turning a nose to
the group."They don't know the high" a Druid thought but he didn't speak up
"they never got a free dose of the ambrosia".If they were warriors or monks
One could understand but this one was a Cleric she strolled by like she was
a greater spellcaster for not indulging but was she?The Mage looked at her
and turned his gaze away...maybe she was , he didn't know. All that he knew
is that he needed a hit,he had his 50p and was waiting.Then she came....the
Baroness one doesn't remember her name just that she was a 60th level
Enchantress willing to dose out KEI to all that would pay.They huddled
around her like moths to a flame.The rush of needy magic users was almost
too much to take in.She was the queen bee in this hive of KEIheads. they
rushed in as quick as they rushed out to get to there destination,the place
they chose to get there next level or two.She was at last ,for a time,
unencumbered by the will of others.She then switched to anonymous once
again.And the mage was well again.
