Umm, Ben, thanks for the support and all but you top posted,
replied to Me but were apparantly talking to Faned, and you
quoted everything I said including my quotes of what he said, in
order to make a 4 line post.

This doesn't actually help make my point as good as you might
think.

Then to add "no successful group can do without a cleric" adds
injury to insult, as at least a third (and more likely half) of
all groups I've been in with any class except a cleric have had
no cleric.  Yes, all the ones I was in with my cleric had one,
but thats kind of hard to avoid.

Clerics are good for many things, but outside of POP or a raid,
they are rarely Necessary.

Even I thought about siding with Faned when I read your post!

Then I came to my senses, since we are arguing over a
mathematical certainty, even though he keeps trying his best to
hit that Evade button.
