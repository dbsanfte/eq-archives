I've come back to my main and found i needed a platinum coin of grobb. I couldn't recall which zone I had started that 
in so i tried google. Nada. Tried assorted searched on the quest name, but i couldn't find which zone the coins spawned 
in. I've noticed this with a lot of collection quests, there's often no reasonable way you can deduce where to go to 
finish them.

Does anyone know where the platinum coin spawns? Or at least a decent site for collections?
