Gasoline is required to run a car, does that make it a "physical part"
of the car, and thusly must be included when you sell the car? Go to
your local car dealership and use the logic above to argue how you
should get free gasoline for life. It fits your argument perfectly,
after all...

No, the software isn't "completely useless" without the account.
Contact SOE, and it's likely you can get a key to set up a new account
through them.

Look at it this way: A Playstation is completely useless without
games. Does that mean the games become "directly linked" and I have to
bundle in all the games when I sell the Playstation? Hell no. A CD
player is completely useless without CDs. A DVD player is useless
without DVDs. A computer is useless without software. Need I continue?

Just because an item REQUIRES another to be useful does NOT mean it
becomes a part of that item and must be sold along with it.

Besides, the account is NOT an "item". It is a service. It is SOE's
sole discresion on how or if that service can be transferred.
