I disagree.  I recently had a group with a SHM as the only healer and once
the fight go going, an add came from nowhere and she started shrieking while
myself and the other rogue (no tanks) pulled the first mob off the dying
caster.  She was still near full health when we got the first mob to start
fleeing so the pet could finish it, but boy! did she think she was the
Primadonna in need of protection!

Had she been in any *real* jeopardy, I've have bolted but she needn't be
panicking over a mob that she probably could have soloed when we kept
another group member from an xp-loss.

Later, I asked for a cure poison and she went on about how I'd insisted we
wouldn't need it earlier.  I told her it was the other guy who'd left
earlier who'd said that.  She called me a liar and, fed up, I tossed her
from the group.  18 months of play and it was the first time I ever threw
someone out of a group.
