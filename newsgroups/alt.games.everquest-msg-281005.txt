Very few raids in EQ involve certain death (if you're winning that is). 
Sony actually left the "deathtouch" concept behind, or rather, they made it
something you could strategize past unlike the original implementation of

implementation so that people only get insta-killed if they don't do
whatever is necessary to stop it from happening.
