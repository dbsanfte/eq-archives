I'm a goody, living in Qeynor (sp?).

Currently a 8 Scout, 9 Artisan.  Just made 9 after mading a bed and
dinig room table.  CRAP !  I forgot to buy the level 9 artisan book on
the way out of the crafting rooms.  Poo.

Woudln't know - I'm still in the first city, although I am a citizen
now.          :)

I have to go out for a few hours, but when I go back, I think I'll
head back into the pit, as I've received a few more quests to do in
there.  Then into Qeynos North, to talk to a few people on my list,
incuding the Scout trainer.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
