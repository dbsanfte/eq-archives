GM events...special, yes that is one way to describe them.

A GM will decide to appear as some NPC or other, in a newbie zone and start
some scenario, this can be anything but is normally quite simple like, get
me orc scalps or something like this. Some of the zone will talk to the
NPC/GM, roleplaying to the best of their ability and rush of to do the
quest, perhaps in the hope of some "phat lewtz" but likely just to do
something different and maybe get something unique, even if not uber. While
they go off on their quest the zone will fill up with around 200 players,
and someone will attack the NPC/GM, it will be in vain as the personality
will have invulnerability but this will wreck the rest of the event,
eventually the GM will turn off invulnerability and the masses of bored
"ubers" will take down the NPC/GM. Some low levels will die in various AoE
attacks and there will be much weeping and gnashing of teeth.

Sometimes the event is actually to kill an adversary that has invaded the
zone, these are the only ones that can actually work properly but as the
MOB(s) are usually geared for the 50+ crowd the low levels can't really do
much but die in one hit. I have heard of events like this where a level
limit was enforced, anyone over 30th (if I recall) was unable to attack the
MOB.

GM events are normally ruined by players in pretty short order :ï¿½/

The only other Special events I can think of are the PvP tournys that get
held, referred to as BoTB (Best of the Best) or Test of Tactics (Team/Group
PvP)
