HI everyone, thanks for the suggestions =)
I admit that i might have concluded my research paper too early, but i
guess it is not really a conclusion, that is just a hypothsis to my
research, the reason that i have come up with such a prediction is
because i have read alot of studies before which do support my
argument, hence i would like to take this opportunity to see if it
also happens to the target group that i want to study...

anyhow, thanks for the comments =)
