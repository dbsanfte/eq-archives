Aftermath:

Last Friday afternoon my system locked in game once again, and when I
tried bringing it back up it informed me that my registry was corrupt.
Unfortunately it wouldn't come back up to allow fixing it.

Turns out it had fried the FAT for both Drive C and Drive H (my EQ
drive).  Result was I had to buy a full install version (versus
upgrade version) of Win 98 and do a reinstall.  Now I have to
reinstall everything that had DLLs on C.

Gonna be a long week.

(Oh, when I reconnected to EQ, it started off with a 24 MB download to
replace everything that got damaged.  Painful, over a 56K modem.)

Nifty Note:
/CAMP DESKTOP takes you out to the desktop, after a 30-second wait.
/Q takes you out instantly, but only to server selection.
/CAMP DESKTOP, followed by /Q, takes you out instantly to the desktop.
