It may seem that your melees are being loot hogs when they kill and loot
over and over again.  One of the primary reasons they do loot a lot is for
targeting, with corpses still alying around the fighting area it makes it
hard to target the next "live" mob.
If you feel you are being slighted on loot and still want/need to med, ask
one of the melees to loot for you and just give it to you every so often
(make sure it is someone you trust at least a little)
