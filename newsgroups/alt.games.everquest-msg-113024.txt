Iksar pros: regen, night vision, higher AC
Human pros: faction

Iksar cons: faction, some equipment choices (minor), a 1/2 second delay
after feigning due to iksar feign animation
Human cons: blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, blind, and some other
minor things

All points into STA, any left over into AGI/STR/DEX in that order of
preference is my opinion.
