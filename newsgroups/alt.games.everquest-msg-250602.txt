Exactly. And people should remember it really is a significant amount
of time to do. Memblur doesn't immediately reset after casting, it has
a significant delay. It has no fail message, so knowing whether or not
it works depends on the mob in question and some practice... and it
fails disturbingly regularly. And finally enchanters aren't
particularly great at finessing a mob down to very low hp; the best
way to do memblurring was to have someone else do the actual damage
before the enchanter memblurs, but now you're talking about three
characters instead of two.
