What "same type of mob" are you talking about?  Some claim cats, other 
claim spiders.  I kill them all to be sure =)

What happened when you did the same exact thing without killing the guy in 
the tower, assuming you tried that?

If I can get my DRD bud to help today, and S. Ro is pretty empty, I'll 
charm the tower guy and clear the zone and see if the AC/SG/Hussein/Terror 
cycle starts.  I think they are unrelated ( tower guy - AC table ), because 
it doesn't make any sense why they would be related, unless the tower guy 
is actually in the table himself ( improbable with his static spawn and the 
AC table spawn points being in several spots ).

I don't mind giving your theory a try - it would be easier to disprove it 
than prove it, though, since I can control the tower guy with charm.

Let me know what "same type of mob" you are referring to and I'll follow 
your instructions exactly but without killing the Tower guy to see what I 
can find out.

If you don't feel like wasting bandwidth here, you can send me email at 
beparkerATyahooDOTcom.
