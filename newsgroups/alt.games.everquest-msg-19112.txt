i have level 19 Barbarian warrior and would like to give him
surename when i get to level 20.. Only problem is that i can't see
what kind of surename would fit to Barbarian warrior i had
something like "Frostsword" in mind, but that sounds way
too general i think, but it should be related somehow with
the cold northen lands! Help me out here please!
Any suggestions are welcome!

Maybe i can mix and match them somehow and find
something unique!?
