Pretty funny that a monk is complaining about AA skills when they are 
doing virtually as much damage as rogues these days, and mitigating 
damage as well as a warrior.  The fact that you have managed to get 133 
AA points kinda proves that you're doing pretty well in the soloing 
stakes.  Try being a soloing ranger doing the same thing.. :)
