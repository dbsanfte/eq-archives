Partial Response - (you will need a good bard to answer fully).

You wouldn't want to set up a multisong  hotkey as the you need to keep
flexible for the situation, ie: resists and stuns etc. A single song hotkey
is as follows assuming the top song memorised is the one you want:

/stopsong
/pause 3, cast 1

I have 4 hotkeys made for the top 4 song (spell) memorization slots and just
change the lineup of these song (spell) slots depending on the situation.
The remaining slots are used for utility songs which aren't used in fighting
or twisted, like invis, charisma etc.

The pause 3 is usable on my system which is pretty decent but not top class
on a cable modem (but overseas) so you may need to choose pause 2, 3, or 4
depending on your situation. The more lag the higher the number. Cast 1 will
cast the first spell slot, cast 2 the second, cast 3 the third and so on.

I have not heard of being able to swap instruments merely by one hotkey -
but you can drag your mellee slots to you hot key bar as well as your
instrument bag which allows for quicker swaps. Leave the instrument bag open
all the time. Still some manual mousework needed though.

I have no problems swapping instuments on the fly now as the swapped out
insrument stays "on your cursor" but swapping from instruments to weapons
and back again is more involved because there is 2 weapons.
