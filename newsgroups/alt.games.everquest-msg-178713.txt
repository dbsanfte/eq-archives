Paludal is good up to 23 without touching the bandits.  As far as I know,
for that level range, nothing else comes close in xp per kill.  I have
soloed both my druid and my enchanter up to 23, finishing out on the highest
level fiends, that are not far from the SH zone.  I have soloed my Ranger
there from level 12 to 15, on the shrooms mostly, between SH and
Shadeweavers zones.  My Wizard on Test has been soloing in there since level
8 killing the smaller shrooms.
