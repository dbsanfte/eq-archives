}Back many years ago when I used to play a human mage on Ayonae Ro
}(This was just before Kunark).  My level 12 mage decided to hop on the

Small flaw in your story... The Ayonae Ro server was added after Kunark.  
I /movelogged there from Karana when it opened, and I started playing with 
a version that included Kunark...
