He sounds like some sort of asshole control freak that you're better off not
grouping with anyway.

The easiest way to do this is to cast the buff on yourself or your pet. 
When it wears off, refresh the group.

But this is the ideal situation.

Sometimes you don't notice the buff blinking because you're getting pounded
on, or trying to land a debuff on the mob, or you went AFK to take a leak,
or whatever.

Sometimes you don't WANT everyone's buffs wearing off at the same time,
because recasting them on the whole raid would drain your mana.  So you buff
people when they ask for it to spread the load around.

Don't worry about timing it.  The only thing I use a timer for is for
refreshing my mezzes, and for that I use a stopwatch.
