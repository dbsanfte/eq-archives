Yeah, that occurred to me on the drive home.  "Death" is actually rather
non-lethal for PCs and NPCs alike in EQ.  So your toon falls down for
a little bit, don't worry you'll get back up again.  Too bad they don't
animate you floating up with a harp (or down with a pitchfork, heh)
like the kiddie cartoons.  Maybe folks would lighten up a bit.
