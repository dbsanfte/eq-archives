How about this plan.

If anyone in the group is missing a spell, then the parchment is handed in to that
person's class guy.  If you get lucky, its theirs, NBG.  If, on the other hand,
its a duplicate, its randomed out among the group as a whole.

Since thats a pain, random it to the group as a whole FIRST, but random again
between the "need" casters to see which class it will be handed in for.  The
"whole group" winner loots it, hands it in to the "need" class guy, and contacts
the "need" winner to hook up if he's lucky.

Of course there's a chance the "whole group" winner will be dishonest and keep the
spell even if its the needed one, but then again there's a chance that the person
who claimed they had a "need" actually has a full spell book and just wants the
spell to sell.  If you can't trust each other, than forget NBG and go GBN, this is
-always- fair.
