if you and I play chess and you kick my ass in the first game I am
likely to remember how you did so and be prepared for that the next
time we play chess. In short I  LEARN by playing with you how to beat
you  (eventually I am over simplifying things)in essence using various
input devices (my eyes) to assimilate data and reprogram myself  IMHO
since deep blue can't learn the way we can it's programmers were
merely doing what you and I would do while playing a chess game mano a
mano
