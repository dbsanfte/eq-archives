This is the first time Blizzard's had any real competition breathing down 
their necks. They certainly didn't when they released Warcraft or Diablo, 
and by the time Diablo II and Warcraft III came along, those franchises were 
established (not to mention the dominance of Starcraft both here and in 
Korea). They're newcomers to the MMOG scene with a lot to learn and their 
first product is going up against the sequel to the biggest success story of 
all time in the genre. They're not used to this situation, I'm not surprised 
that they're making unnatural decisions.

Doesn't mean they can't pull it off, it just doesn't surprise me that 
they're changing tactics.
