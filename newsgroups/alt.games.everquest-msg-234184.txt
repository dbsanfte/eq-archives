You can't even call it a manaless dot since you're loosing a lot of
mana regen by meleeing instead of cannibalizing. I find myself
(off)tanking often in my groups but I don't recall the last time I
actually turned on auto-attack.

Agreed. Other than hard LDoN and Daiku in Tactics, I can't really
think of any place where I don't offtank efficiently.

In most groups, I find my rain spells to be the best way of adding
DPS. Our nukes are just too pitiful to contemplate.

I haven't done too many hard LDoNs, mainly because my usual group
doesn't have a good puller for them. In the ones I have done, rains
were still my  main way of doing damage.

Tigir's rocks in regular LDoN! <g>
