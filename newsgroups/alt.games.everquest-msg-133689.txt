    In that case, the best XP groups all have clerics in them: AoE groups.
;-) And note that you didn't say "power XP groups" at first, but merely
"efficient XP groups". Anyone earning the kind of XP CT offers is likely
pretty efficient.

    Depends strongly on the mobs. With a cleric you can handle high damage,
low HP mobs that are much higher level (51-55) than the
shaman-as-only-healer group. One blown slow usually sets a shaman-only group
back unless they're plowing through low blues, like in FG. And most of the
zones like FG that have hordes of those low blues are camped by AoE groups
24/7.
