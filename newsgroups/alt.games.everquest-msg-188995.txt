Generaly higher level monsters have heavier faction hits. Id guess maybe 30
to make you kos at that level. Youll probably be kos through most of the
karanas too. Seems unnecesary to me, plenty of other good things to camp.
Gnolls at splitpaw, and crazed goblins in butcherblock come to mind.
Probably better loot too (goblins especially). Good ol loio will be low dark
blue too, west of the lake.
