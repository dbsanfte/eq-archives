u call me a beggar but i freely give out what buffs i can 
i sit in the newbie area in everfrost and buff and power lev 1-6 levs
for hours at a time

when i was young i was given a set of fine steel swords without asking
so know instead of going to the tunnel and being greedy and sell my old
gear after i buy new gear i go to a newbie area and give it out i have
gone as far as to give a slime coated to a 5th lev shaman when i was
maxed on skill 
yes i ask for buffs but i don't run away when i see someone getting
there ass handed to them by a giant even thou i will probley die
taunting it so they can run to zone

what i am saying is i would rather be called a beggar than greedy
