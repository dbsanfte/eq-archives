Actually, Newport News, but the closest Navy Federal is down on the south
side (grrrr... we've got the dang shipyard up here, and all they give us is
a single ATM ten miles from where we work.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
