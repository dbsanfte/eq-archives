Lvl 31 war and doesn't know where to find info on level caps? Together with
the rest of your questions I assume E-bay, ignorant kid, playing a friends
account or pl-ed by a friend in a matter of days.
Any of these questions should have been answered the second you looked
somewhere for what skills need training and what the hell a skill does.

I'm lvl 41 now with my main, but questions like these I got answered before
my first char hit lvl 10 (around 9 months and 5 characters ago).

If you've really played this game while being totally ignorant of your
surroundings and information, you could at least do a ng-google-search for
the questions you laid down here. All were answered some time ago.
