The only problems I have IN GAME are in Dreadlands where it seems the lag is
almost as bad as PoK around the main bank. My worst lag occurs in the
bazaar, but from what I been hearing from some folks I group with and in the
guild I belong to they also experience the same problem of lag in the
bazaar.

Now, I wasn't having your problem of choosing your character, I was having a
"You have been disconnected" after reaching the server screen to choose your
server.  Which has Never happened before till today.  I have always had "You
are unable to connect to the server at this time please try again shortly"
during patch days.  It's just the "You have been disconnected" part is all
new. Hopefully they will get this fixed ASAP as I am having withdrawl
symptoms and am cruising the casters realm site trying to relax...... LOL
