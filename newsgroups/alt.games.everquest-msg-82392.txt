im on the zerbuxerux(or however its spelled) im board and i think it would
be fun to get a high level tank or two  to wait at the zone edge of the sro
and inauthule swamp, a couple like 20 or so lev.i with sow run through all
the orc camps in sro grass lands and drag them to the two or so tanks.rezone
then help with heal but i think it would be a hoot to watch them be over run
by mobs and they quickly send them on there way.what do you guys think?im a
15 druid i may be killed on the way with the oracles and what not.but ill
try it .it would be a good everlore pic.
