XP for each level remained the same. What they did was inject a level
modifier for xp. The old hell levels 51, 54, 59 still require a large
amout of xp to finish but are given a modifier so that you get more xp
at those levels (Thank you ShowEq). The down side of this that you are
getting penalized at the other levels. Think we would of all been
better off if they had just fixed the 50s to eliminate the killer time
sink but dont bet on it happening.
