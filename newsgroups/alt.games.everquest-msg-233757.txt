Rallic Packs are a good source of income - hunt the Grimling Runner in
Tenebrous (90 min timer) and the Owlbears in Hollowshade. You can have
quite a nice manufacturing chain going - 1 A Rallic pack Token in the
bazaar, one finished bag, one pattern and one runner pouch.

You will also want to look at the quest for the cloak which rangers
and druids can get given in Katta - it has clicky camo on it. There is
also a recharable face invis item in katta. If your server still has
them, the Shield of Bane Warding is a nice little earner, and for
plate classes there is the Katta Loyalist Shield of Honour.

Think of Katta as the Good alligned Wis caster city and Seru as the
evil melee/int caster city (with some exceptions - there are good
quests in both.

Don't worry about your Seru faction too much - after a LOT of questing
for Katta I am still not KOS in Seru - a little Recuso or Thought
leech hunting will fix that too.
