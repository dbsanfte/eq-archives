Mm, and if you don't trust me, you can find another customer. Both
ends are getting something out of the deal, but one or the other has
to take the risk. If he's not willing to take the risk of paying ahead
and willing to walk or look for another port instead, fine. But what
makes you say he has any less right to play it safe than you do? He
has as much right to get snippy about you not wanting to take the risk
as you do to get snippy at him for not wanting to take the risk. Lose
the high horse, it's not very becoming...


Oh, and to the OP... Your comment about coming from a long way to port
someone who asked on the taxi channel for a port then decided he
didn't want it when you asked payment up front... That's why you tell
them you wanna be payed up front BEFORE going out to meet them. Easy,
huh?
