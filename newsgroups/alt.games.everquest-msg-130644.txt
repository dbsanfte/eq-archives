I'm afraid that it may now be in vain.  If you (or anyone else) created a
toon named Curism on that server, I believe that as soon as the new toon was
saved the old one was overwritten.  Backups not withstanding, of course ....
but I bet they backup pretty frequently and only save the past few most
recent.
