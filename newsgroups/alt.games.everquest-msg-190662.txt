You can change the facial features along with hair type and color (/face).
As far as your necro goes, good luck.  Changing the facial feature may fix
what you're seeing but you'll have to live with the big long heads.  With
big brains come big sacrifice......  I wouldn't get to bent out of shape

PS:  Congrats on the PC upgrade!
