    Yup, Fear a Sarnak into the fort then run like crazy. Sit in some safe
area away from the fort and enjoy the faction.

    My enchanter recently found a fun way to get faction in The Warrens
which would work for any pet caster that was crazy enough. Get a pet that's
within aggro range of the mobs in the zone (in terms of level). Pull a mob,
sic the pet, let the mob run. The pet will get adds, which it'll fight on
the spot, which will run, which will take it to more adds.... I was having
great fun. Charm a kobold, watch another attack it, then watch them run into
the distance and the faction messages come a pouring in. When the pet
eventually died, Charm the biggest part of the resulting train and continue.
