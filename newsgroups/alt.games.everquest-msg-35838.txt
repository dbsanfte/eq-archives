70 may have been minimum back when the level cap for Naggy/Vox wasn't
in place, but these days 70 FR/CR/MR against Vox/Naggy is just lag
fodder.

Sacrifice ALL other stats for resists.  Remember, we're talking about
a mob who melees relatively slowly for 255 per pop at most.  Their
main damage output isn't from melee, it's from the AoE.

When all the raiders have resists at 250+ level, you've effectively
removed about 80% of the damage output of those dragons.
