Well, if you're going to go off on a tangent, I hope you'll understand
why I'm picking on you.

Invest can also mean devote time/effort to something. I could invest
my time in charity and never get a return. And, he does get a return,
a character he loves playing, friends he enjoys hanging out with. And,
even if you can't put a price on that, the time he spent playing is
worth more to him than the bill of the game, just like I value the
time I spend  playing beyond the 40 dollars I pay the phone company
every month for my nightly activities.
Should I perhaps try to sell you a berry pie to make sure my invested
time adheres with the definition you're clinging to?

Back to the point: some of us don't give away passwords, and we would
like to know that we *could* react if something somehow should happen
to our characters without being given the boot. As it is, I guess that
if we got hacked, we'd have to reset our passwords (i.e. get the
account back under control) and then set about the task of replacing
gear and any lost exp/faction without saying a word to Verant if we
wanted to keep spending time with in game friends after the incident.
