One thing you have to understand about soloing is that anyone can solo, its
just that some solo better than others. I solo my bard alot, but I work real
well in a group as well. A nec druid and mage can solo real well, with the
nec and mage easily taking mobs a level or two higher than them. The druid
can as well, but not until around level 14 or so. At least that was my
experience.
