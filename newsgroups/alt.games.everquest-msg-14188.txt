New goblins in ButcherBlock come to mind, should con yellow/red to him,
green to you.
Depending on what factions you are worried about you could do the Millers in
QH.  You could also do Shadowmen since they are all over and quick spawns.
Broon and his lvl 25 brother in EK but that is a slow spawn(6 mins)
How about the new Najena, right near the entrance are some new MOBs as long
as he can get a spell to hit, but they are skel's and don't run when low on
HP.
