I knew that post would draw a response from someone. ;-)

I remember reading a survey some time ago that found that while a majority
of folks believed in some sentient being firmly on the good side of the
ledger (whatever one wants to call him/her/it), far fewer believed in a
sentient being working the other side of the street.  I found that
interesting.

If the Christian bible is used as a reference, then there are passages in
both the Old and New Testaments that specifically state an interaction with
demonic-type spirits ... heck, Jesus even had a hoedown with the Devil
himself in Matthew.

To me, it makes sense that if there are undeniably good folks in the world
(like Mother Teresa), and undeniably evil folks in the world (Dahmer, Bundy,
etc.), that the same would exist on some sort of deity level.  Not that one
created the other, but it's kind of hard to have a yin without a yang.

Now, the belief as to whether any of those beings intercede in our daily
existence is up to the individual believer, I suppose.  I know people who
look at everything as "God's will" ... it's a handy way to dismiss things.
I also know people who see the Devil in their lives everytime something bad
happens to them ... one person blamed Satan for causing a fender-bender.
For myself, I tend to hope that my life isn't being micromanaged on a daily
basis.

But then again, to me it makes sense that if some omnipotent being created
the whole universe, he/she/it wouldn't be so short-sighted to only put life
on one teeny-tiny planet.

Maybe the Devil exists ... maybe the Devil doesn't exist.  Insofar as I
know, there's only one way to find out, and that's one research expedition
I'd like to delay for as long as possible.  Given the inability to prove it
one way or the other, it's strikes me that whether God or the Devil exists
is up to the individual's belief system.

It reminds me of my favorite line from Serial Experiments: Lain.  The
opening of the final Layer, where Lain says (and I'm paraphrasing here)
"Where is the true me?  I only exist in people who are aware of my
existence."
