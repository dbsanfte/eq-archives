Since the two undocumented patches I have been getting far more misses when
I melee and my max hits seem to have gone down a bit.  Also the druid
lightening spell which has always held at around 97hps per cast varies
widely now.  Not sure what is going on here but it seems like a lot of
attacks have been quietly nerfed.  I am also getting more fizzles and
resists from even common and very dependable spells like snare and this is
with a level 40 ranger with the needed casting skills maxed.
