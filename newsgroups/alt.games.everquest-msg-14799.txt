Known problem with DirectX and the EQ graphic engine, I think. I remember
something in a recent patch message where they were trying to fix reduce
that. I think it has to do with far-away polygons and how they overlap... I
suspect all video cards are going to be prone to this, it's just a lot of
people don't run with the clipping plane all the way out, and so, they don't
see it.

the card.

Probably a driver bug. Switiching to one of the sixteen gazillion officical
or unofficial nVidia Detonator releases may make this problem better/worse.
I don't play up that high (just 1024x768, same as my desktop), so I've not
seen this.
