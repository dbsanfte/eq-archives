Ok I would like to start fresh with a new character, I have a fungi
tunic and probly close to 50k I can throw to this char.  I am
wondering what yall might reccomend to play, also if need be I have a
friend who will MQ jboots for this char.  I played a warrrior a long
long time ago and got burned out because I could not find groups.  The
classes I was thinking of playing are a warrior, shaman, ranger, monk.
 But I am not sure, anyone have any ideas?  I was leaning towards a
shaman cause they have alot to do, and maybe a warrior cause they are
such good tanks. With this kidna of money and equipment what would you
reccomend to play?

Any help would be appreciated.
