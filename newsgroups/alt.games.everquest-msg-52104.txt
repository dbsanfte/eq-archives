Yep.  That's the answer.  If tradeskill items were as good as the best mob
dropped items, people would do the tradeskills and those that didn't want to
sink a great deal of time into learning tradeskills would buy the items off
of the players who did.  This is an excellent solution.  I wonder though....
What happens after everybody already has all of these great tradeskill
items?  If there is a market for them, then the tradeskillers would be very
happy to produce and sell them.  After everybody has them, wouldn't the
trade skills once again be useless?

There must be a way to solve *that* problem.  <puts thinking cap on>

Best Regards
