A law can be challenged on various grounds.  Congress and various states
have a long history of passing laws that the courts find unconstitutional,
for example, and strike down.

As far as juries go, they can do anything they want, as far as upholding the
law goes, because there is no punishment for failing to uphold the law.
E.g., a jury can believe that you violated a law, but also believe that that
the law is not right, and so declare you not guilty.  In a criminal matter,
the state cannot appeal, so that verdict is final for you.

This is called jury nullification, and is a feature, not a bug--the idea is
that if the state tries to use a law unreasonably (e.g., the district
attorney *wants* to nail you for something (or just doesn't like you) but
cannot get you on anything reasonable, but then finds out that you gave your
wife oral sex, and so charges you under an old sodomy law that is still on
the books), you'll probably get someone on the jury who recognizes that it
would simply not be just to convict you, no matter what the law says.

However, there's a problem with jury nullification, which was recognized by
the people that founded our legal system.  The problem is how to prevent the
jurors from doing this too often.  The solution is that the defense is NOT
allowed to tell the jury about this.  Jurors take an oath to uphold the law,
even if they disagree with this.  The idea is that jurors won't disregard
that oath and acquit the "guilty" except in very exceptional circumstances.

There are some people trying to change it so that jurors are instructed by
the judge on the nullification right.  All the proposals I've seen have been
written by idiots--they included no checks or balances against the
nullification power, and so would make a joke out of many trials, and
greatly *increase* the injustices of the system.
