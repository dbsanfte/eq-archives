How about "Because it's off-topic"?
How about "Because he asked you to"?
How about "Because it's a science-vs.-religion discussion, which
will degrade into a flamewar almost as fast as a Heinlein/gun
control/abortion/Microsoft-vs-Linux/Emacs-vs-Vi discussion"?
How about "Because it's a followup to a spam posting, which no sane
person should ever follow up to, not even to point out the fact that
it is spam, because people with good news providers never see the
actual spam post in the first place, at least until someone follows
up to it, quoting the entire original post"?

None of those good enough?

How about "Because you're cross-posting this"?

That get your attention?

ALWAYS look at the Newsgroups: line before posting, and trim it if
you think there are groups in that line that don't necessarily belong.

Just because of that, rcs, you're not getting my stuff. And I recently
quit, too...
