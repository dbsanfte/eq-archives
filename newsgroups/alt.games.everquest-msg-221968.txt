I have the shovel (worst of the lot, doesn't improve HP only AC)
and Stein.  I think at this point the only way to get any other
ones is going to be to buy them, as the mobs that drop the parts
are green to me, and on FV this means they don't drop magic items
due to the TLC.

I didn't deliberately avoid the torch, mind you, those were the
only two to drop.  I stopped because I didn't care much about 
the torch and could live without the air one, and killing
crocodiles for days on end in Feerrot just wasn't any fun
anymore.  Now I wish I had the torch of course... but facing days
more and a 50% chance of any drop I -do- get being one I already
have?  Ick.

I am particularly chagrined because I've also given up research,
can't even buy the words in bazaar anymore, and it just happens
that I have focus for BOTH pets at 34 and NIETHER pet at 39. 
Bah.
