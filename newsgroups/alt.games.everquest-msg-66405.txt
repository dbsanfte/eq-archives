> No one buys RDRAM, P4s suck.

  While I certainly agree that price/performance wise, Pentium 4's kind of
suck, they are still popular.  Every single PC  I see advertised on TV has a
Pentium 4 in it, so what exactly do you think most people are buying?
Gateway and Dell don't sell AMD processors and will only put Celerons in
their low end setups with other low quality, low performance components.

  So unless you're building yourself or buying from a smaller computer
manufacturer, your new computer probably has a Pentium 4 and probably uses
some flavor of RDRAM.

  P4s may suck, but a lot of people are still "forced" buy RDRAM.
