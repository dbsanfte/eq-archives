So who really is causing a problem here.  The game manufacturer for not
being able to make their game function perfectly in Win2K or the
customers who insist on trying to play games on an OS that even the
producer says is not meant for optimal gaming?  I seem to recall VI
originally saying they had no intention of supporting that OS but the
huge number of folks who complained that they just had to have the
latested Microcludge on their PCs to feel l337 even though it was a
really bad idea led them to make the effort needed to get it to run as
well as it does now.  So is the problem the folks so silly as to insist
on using Win2K for gaming or the gaming company silly enough to worry
about offending them by telling them to screw off?  

Feel free to debate folks <EG>.
