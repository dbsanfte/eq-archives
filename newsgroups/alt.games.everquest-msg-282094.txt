Hey, grats.  =)

My first big purchase on Monual was E-Boots - it took me forever to scrape 
the 8K together, and even then the E-Boots weren't insta-clicky like 
J-Boots.  So I've always harbored a bit of jealously towards those people 
who do have J-Boots.  =)

And they're still useful for outdoor encounters against mobs that debuff. 
So hang on to them and enjoy.

-Richard
