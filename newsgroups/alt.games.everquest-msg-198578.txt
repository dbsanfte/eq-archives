She can install fine. It is the account codes she will need, which you
have already used.

SO yeah, you need to also buy her a gold box edition for her to have
the same expansions. All of the codes are tied to your account,
forever, until the end of time. Even if you cancel your account the
codes are still tied to it making them useless except to be used by
someone in account ownership verification IF they also have your
account.

You might balk at this, but it makes sense. Lets say 9 guys are in
some college house together and they all play eq. If they only needed
one set of software then SOE just sold 8 less sets of software than it
would have if they each needed one, they are all going to buy it to
play the game anyway. It makes good business sense and its why they've
sold upwards of 500,000 (possibly even more, to have 430,000 or more
current subscribers)
