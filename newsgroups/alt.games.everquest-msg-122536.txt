    It happens, especially if I'm between "transfer to alts" times or have
been tradeskilling. Yesterday, when I was making the nine gifts for my
Earring of the Solstice (one gift to go!), I was seeing stuff that I
auto-equipped drop into packs seven and eight. Mind you I'd never go and put
anything from my persona in the trade window if there wasn't a place for it
to drop....
