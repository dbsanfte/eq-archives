 That's because your a mentalist Dan. The mentalist class is broken.
:-)   mentalists desperately need the lullabye instacast mem blur that
bards have along with their charm spells fixed, and possibly the
Bubble spell (maybe self only). 

But what is your downtime? 4 minutes MAX between fights. thats how
long it takes to recover full mana. From empty. 

I do agree though that the exp system loss on death is too high
without options in DAoC. I believe Rezzers should be able to cast ress
on Tombstones (with the same effect as praying to them but with an
added summons of the person), I believe the resses should start off
with 1 con point reduction and 50% exp returrned and step up to 3 con
points recovered and 80-90% exp returned.  I also think in a few
months when the main game population ets in the 30's and 40's we will
see these changes.
