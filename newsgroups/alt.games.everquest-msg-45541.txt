This question was asked by someone just reaching low level raid stages, the
points you mention are for end game, your points are valid for end game, I
suppose but, not for his level. Can't see anyone under 55ish heading to ToV.

Also, look at my point, we all have our preferences (maybe they are server
specific) all I can tell you is I have never been on a guild event, mini
raid, or full raid where the healers used a zone channel. But then again I
only play on one server. Also, I have never been to ToV so I can not address
those issues.
