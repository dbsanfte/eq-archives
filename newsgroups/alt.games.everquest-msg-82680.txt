My wife framed the cloth map for my son.  It is prominently displayed in
his bedroom.  The other day he and I were grouped with my dad and a few
others.  After a little run of bad luck, my boy declared to me that he was
going to quit EQ.  I asked if that meant I could put the map in my office.
He quickly changed his tune.       ;-)      He got over it in a hurry, too, btw.
