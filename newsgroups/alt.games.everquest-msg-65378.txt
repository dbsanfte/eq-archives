Disclaimer: With the release of EQ:SoL it is impossible to say which
video card will be the best over the long term. Due to the published
system requirements (and my intial first impressions after loading
EQ:SoL) I would try to get at least 64mb of onboard video memory to
stay on the safe side, regardless of which card you choose.

NVidia:
There are really no "Bad" NVidia based cards. The major differences
are in 2D quality (eq possible clured text on the desktop) over
1024x768, due to different rf resistors used by the various
manufacturers. 

GOOD NVidia card makers (these have the best reputation for image
quality):
Elsa
VisionTek
LeadTek
Gainward
Hercules
PNY
Asus

By far the best bang-for-the-buck today is the GeForce 3 Ti200 cards.
You can find them online through www.pricewatch.com for @$170.00. That
is a 64mb DDR card with the top of the line NVidia chip. The only
difference between the GF3Ti200 and the GF3-Ti500 is core and memory
clock speeds (thus over-all frames per second). The features and
abilities are identical. (GF3 rankings by speed-->GF3Ti200, GF3,
GF3Ti500) Most Ti200 can be overclocked to meet or exceed a standard
GF3.

One step below the GF3 is the GeForce2 GTS 64mb DDR. (There is a 32mb
version, but with SoL you are better off betting a 64mb card if
possible.) You will also see GF2 MX cards listed. These cards are
"crippled" versions of the standard GTS. They have a restricted
pipeline between the GPU (graphics chip) and the onboard RAM, These
cards cannot take advantage of DDR (double data-rate memory) due to
this limitation. This makes them slower over-all.

GF3Ti200 64mb DDR @$170.00 www.pricewatch.com

GeForce2 MX400 64mb SDR @52.00 www.pricewatch.com

GeForce2 GTS 32mb DDR @$64.00 www.pricewatch.com

GeForce2 GTS 64mb DDR @$94.00 www.pricewatch.com

ATI:

ATI's current flagship card is the Radeon 8500. (That is what I have,
and I love it!) Before that I had the standard Radeon 32DDR LE.

The biggest problem with ATI is the drivers. It is not unusual to wait
a couple of months for a new beta or release driver to fix problems
with some games. (NVidia seems to release a new beta driver every 2-3
weeks on average, as a point of reference) It took ATI most of a year
to sort out issues with the original Radeon, especially in Win2K. I
have never had a problem with EQ, so drivers have never been an issue
for me. With EQ:SoL the future is uncertain though.

I purchased the OEM model known as the Radeon 8500LE (clocked at
250core/250memory), instead of the retail (275/275 ships with games
and demos) This is also a 64mb DDR card and offers similar speed and
more features than the GF3. (It even beats the GF3Ti500 in some
benchmarks)

So why did I pick ATI over NVidia? Image quality!!!!! 2D and 3D color
saturation, "crispness", and clarity are much better than the NVidia
offerings. Also EQ has always run well on my Radeon (SoL looks amazing
on the 8500)

When it comes to price ATI offers some interesting choices.

Radeon 32DDR LE (one generation behind the new Radeon 8500, in the
GeForce 2 GTS class of cards.) @$62.00  www.pricewatch.com

Radeon 8500LE (OEM model) @$189.00  www.pricewatch.com

Radeon 8500 Retail @$225.00 www.pricewatch.com
