If you hadn't told us that we wouldn't know you weren't a native
speaker.  And Yes, Everquest and Usenet are social games which are
international.  But when you post in a language and refuse to use
capitalization and punctuation, you will be flamed.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
