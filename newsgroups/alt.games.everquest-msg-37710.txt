I'll miss it too, a lot.  I always check it and base some of
my in-game plans on it (e.g., I won't travel long distances
to commonly camped spots if the server population is high,
but I will go try my luck if not many people are on).

I also rely on it a lot when I'm having connection problems --
if the server population is still high, then the problem
is probably on my end, if the server population is half
(or less) of its usual value, then I know the problem is
on the Verant server/router end.
