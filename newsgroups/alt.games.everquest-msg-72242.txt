I play a Vah Shir beastlord on Sullon Zek as my main. It's true that
there aren't all that many. SZ probably has the emptiest newbie zones
on Luclin of all the servers. I have never, EVER seen more than 15
people in any of the zones. Well, that' not quite true. When a bunch
of the servers went down about a week ago, a bunch of newbies from the
other servers created chars, but most of them didn't stick around.
Since there are no agnostics on SZ, all the kitties worship Tunare,
she is their only choice for a diety. Thus they are a 100% good race,
the only one that the goods have. The teams still are not balanced
populationwise, but the addition of the kitties has given the good
team a shot in the arm. Plus you don't see nearly as many greenie
ganking griefers up on Luclin as you do in say Crushbone or Everfrost.
I was able to get to level 19 up there with no problem, only being
PKed twice (and both times by the same person, who was level 50+) as
opposed to being disrupted every day, several times a day down on
Norrath. Vah Shir make great rogues, beastlords, shamans and warriors.
The population has fallen low enough so that if you have problems in
one zone, all you have to do is pack up your group and head somewhere
else. Most of the zones are empty, or nearly so. If anyone feels the
need to check out the server, start up a good and come on over.
