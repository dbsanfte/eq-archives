Enchanters have it easy...crowd control with a bard is quite a bit harder
then a enchanter...plus we are limit to the 4..maybe 5 mobs if your quick.
Chanters get to aoe stun/mezz..then relax and mezz each target saving the
healers alot of mana too.

Nerf the Enchanters aoe stun/mezz damn it...Make em work for those mezzes.
Then they can boast about having a "hard" class to play...well hell just
give bards aoe stun/mezz then they chanter can sell crack all day in the
nexus and let us bards show what really mana regen and haste is.
