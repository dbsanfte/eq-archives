My lvl 7 ogre beastlord is looking for a mystic doll from a lizardman
mystic. I've killed loads of them along them in the camps near the river
(Oggok side) and have yet to find one or even see a mystic who looks
like he's holding one. Am I hunting in the wrong place? Do the mystics
in Rathe Mtns drop them more often? or should I just hunt at the other
side of the river? I didn't think they were so rare!

Cheers Watchman :)
