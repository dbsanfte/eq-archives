Thank you!!

I just switched off my virus scanner and firewall, jumped into the 
game...and everything was moving as smoothly as it does on other 
games...and smoother than it used to, as well. I was even able to whip 
all my graphical settings up to maximum (including a 100% clip plane) 
without it impacting the performance at all.

Interestingly the net stat is still showing a ping of 200 on Firiona Vie 
(Though only 75 on Venril Sathir).
