> Halfling with SOW potions wondering if its worth it to buy a horse?

I bought the cheapest horse for my twink enchanter, cost 8399pp.  On
sell back I will loose 780pp should I decide to sell it back.  I have
mixed feelings about it.

Pros:
1.  I can run faster than normal run speed mobs.  This makes charm
soloing much safer.
2.  Medding while standing really adds up.  It is amazing how much
this helps keep the mana bar full.
3.  I can sell it back at a small loss should my main ever need the
plat back.  JBoots or TBoots are yours forever.

Cons:
1.  Run speed is only slightly faster on the horse than off.  This
means you really can't run ahead of a mob, stop, and cast on them
before they catch up.  You don't outdistance them enough.
2.  Targeting is difficult using the mouse to click on mobs.  The head
of the horse fills the bottom center of the screen, so I am always
targeting the horse instead of the mob.  Need to F9 to different
cameras alot.  Looting is almost impossible without flipping to
different camera views.  This is very annoying because I fail to see
the game-play reason behind it.
3.  It takes more than 2 seconds to get up to speed or slow to a stop.
 This gives mobs more of a chance to stun you and keep you stunned
when you are trying to run away.

So what is my conclusion?  Is the cheapest horse worth 8399pp?  Do the
math.  If you used 10 shots of sow potion a day, that much plat could
keep you in potions for more than two years.  Don't buy the horse if
you want to run fast because there are better ways.  The long
acceleration/deceleration time you can get used to.  Is the mana regen
part worth the annoyance caused by targeting issues?  I am starting to
think no, for me it is not.  The 780pp I will loose when I sell the
horse back could have bought almost 80 shots of SoW from a friendly
shammy.
