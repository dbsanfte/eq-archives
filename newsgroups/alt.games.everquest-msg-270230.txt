Yes, that is correct.

But they don't. You said it yourself above. They're in a group. So if you
kill two of the three you *don't get* the two scalps no matter what you do
with the third (unless you kill it too). The other alternative is to seek
out the uncommon "solo" gnoll.

The games mechanics don't give you that option. Say you had to kill 10
gnolls. You could take out a group of 3 by yourself (they'd most likely be
green or grey to you) so you'd need *4* groups of 3 to finish. Or you could
do 3 groups and try to find a solo.

Quite honestly with the system in place I really don't see where "tactics"
come into play. You click the mob and it tells you the con and even whether
it's above the con or significantly above the con (up arrows) and whether
they're linked (group). The only tactics involved are the HOs and I see
them becoming more of a spam extra damage (or buff) than anything else.

What's the difference? It still *plays* like a single player game (the same
could be said about any MMOG out there. It really boils down to the
individuals play style) - only the npc's you'd pick up in a single player
game are replaced by real people. I can do what you describe above in
Baldur's Gate or PS:T or in (most) any other CRPG.

My feeling is they should have implemented level based buffs. A 50 won't be
able to get a buff to stick on a 30. The spell set in EQ2 is *much* smaller
than in EQ. Most spells are "upgrades" of lower level spells. I believe you
should be able to buff within this "upgrade" zone. For example, you get
your nifty uber shield spell at level 10. Your next upgrade is level 15.
You should be able to buff people with the level 10 spell up until they're
15. Not overpowering by any means but also not limiting the players the way
it is now. And BTW Sony shot themselves in the foot with the leveling craze
(in other words it's not just because of buffing). All of the extra content
from post-Luclin on (IMO) is meant for top level raiders. What have they
added (as far as content) for the under 50 crowd since then?

I agree with you here that they should be *played* from 1 to 50+. What I
disagree with are the methods to force you into doing it. My highest
character (in five years) in EQ was only 47. I never made 50. But I had
tons of alts. The lower and mid levels are what made the game to me.
Seeking out new areas and exploring was my bag. For me, there just came a
time when I felt SOE didn't care about the lower level content at all
anymore and they lost me. They lost me with EQ2 even more rapidly when I
discovered the wrapper was prettier than the box. Tear off the wrapper and
you have an ugly brown box (empty).
