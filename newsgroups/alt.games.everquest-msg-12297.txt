Okay, I have a question about the firepots in Td. First of all, what are
the locations that you can port to with each of them, and where in their
respective zones do they drop you? A link to info would be fine. Also, I
realize that you can no long BE BOUND in the room, but is it still
possible to bind yourself there? I have my 14 druid in NRo right now,
and with all the places I think you can go from there, it seems like
it'd be the best place to bind him. What is the best route/strategy to
get there? I have levitate, SoW and Cammo, so hopefully I can just run
over the water to get there. On EQ Atlas, it looks like I can just take
a boat from Oasis to TD, and then run almost due south from there. Would
my little wood elf but be Ogre munchies f I let the boat dock before I
get going? Can I cast on the boat that takes me from Oasis to TD? Are
there any dangers by just running from that first island down to the FP
room? Also according to Eqatlas, there's an underwater entrance to the
FP room. I have Enduring breath, so this shouldn't be a problem, but is
there anything down in the water that would love to have me for a tasty
treat? Thanks for all your help!

Brent
