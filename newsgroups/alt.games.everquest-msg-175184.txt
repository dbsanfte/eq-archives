	A dozen missiles would have no value.  *If* the missiles could actually
bypass defenses (they'd have no way to test them), the aggressor would have a
laughable counterstrike capability.

	In order for a nuclear arsenal to function as a viable deterrent, it has
to be massive.  An aggressor would have to upgrade his entire arsenal to cope
with a missile defense, and if he didn't have a defense of his own, all he'd
accomplish is moving back to MAD.  As for building both a new nuclear arsenal
and ABM at the same time, the Soviets already found out they couldn't beat us
in one arms race.  Two would be out of the question.
