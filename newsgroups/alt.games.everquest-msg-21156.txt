To pull them one at a time cast the spell Numb the Dead (Level 4) on each of
the undead you don't want to come after you.  The problem with this is that
it takes a bone chip and 20 mana to cast.  When I was playing my necro about
a year ago, a great place at level 8 was the chessboard in Butcherblock.  If
necros or the chessboard were nerfed this may no longer work, but back in
the day I was killing yellows and reds easily.  Just make sure you have Numb
the Dead, your level 8 pet, and Ward Undead.  Summon your pet, find a good
pawn to kill (start with yellows, once you get good you can go for the
reds), cast Numb on the other chess pieces around it, cast a DoT on it, sic
your pet once it's out of range of the other pieces, and nuke it as fast as
you can with Ward Undead.  Stick to pawns mostly, be sure not to screw with
bishops, knights, high level rooks, and the King because they are specialty
classes (King is level 15 too) and can take you down quite quickly, until
you're around level 11 or 12 that is.  By then you will be moving on anyway
though.  A great spot after that is sirens in oot, I went from 12-16 or so
in like 8 hours.  There are two groups of sirens, some that give faction
hits and some that don't, overall the ones that don't give faction hits will
level you faster, especially if you can control all of the spawns.
