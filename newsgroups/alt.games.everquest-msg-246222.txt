Halflings get a bonus (5%). 

Barbarians get a slight penalty (10%) but have the advantage of being
a large race, high starting high stamina and good faction. 

Ogres get a slightly higher penalty (15%) but the advantage they are
unstunable from the front and the highest starting stamina.

Iksar and Trolls have natural regen and the highest exp penalty (20%).
