The GUI differences are only apparent in fullscreen mode, not windowed 
mode. Basically you can do pretty much everything you can do in windowed 
mode in fullscreen mode now (check inventory, loot, shop at merchants) plus 
move and resize all the windows for chat, inventory, buffs, etc.

Perhaps you're playing in windowed mode so you aren't seeing anything 
different? Hit F10 a couple of times.

As to the Velious armours, if you don't see them, edit your eqclient.ini 
file and make sure it contains:

LoadVeliousArmor=TRUE
LoadArmor17=TRUE
LoadArmor18=TRUE
LoadArmor19=TRUE
LoadArmor20=TRUE
LoadArmor21=TRUE
LoadArmor22=TRUE
LoadArmor23=TRUE


That should load all the velious armour textures you're missing.
