It is a "feature not a bug".

The puller must be in xp range when mobs die or nobody gets xp. It has 
nothing to do with damage done. (Where puller is defined as 'first 
person on the mobs hate list' not to be confused with 'person who has 
generated the most hate').

Quite frankly I'm not sure if there is a logical reason for this to be 
so. It may be an anti-powerlevelling or anti-exploit code, but given 
what you *can* get away with in terms of PLing etc it seems out of place 
and ineffective on that front. I would be interested here the devs 
response to your question.

As far as mitigating it...you have to 'not be first person the mobs hate 
list'... and this requires you to get the mob to completely forget you, 
leaving someone else first on the list. This can be done via memblur 
[sometimes], zoning, feign death [sometimes] etc can do it, but none of 
these are really viable because they are unreliable/time consuming

Your best bet, afaik, is to just make sure you are in range when it drops.
