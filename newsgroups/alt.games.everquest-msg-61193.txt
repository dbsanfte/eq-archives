With the Damage cap you'll not receive much of a bonus for better weapons,
what you have will see you into your low twenties.

Armour, Large plate normally sells for about 10pp per AC (which I understand
is often at a loss to the maker) They may ask more for large. I'd suggest
trying to get the best AC you can for your plat rather than look for magic
armour, you could possibly afford a DF breast Plate or an enamelled one for
500pp but with no change I have, however seen Giant Woven Vests for 200pp
and less (AC18 +10str +some hp, large race only) if you see one for a
similar price (same or less basically) it'd be a good buy.

Look for someone making FP to order or see if anyone is selling anything in
EC (or whatever your bazaar zone is on your server) Black alloy armour is
also an option (mix and match to replace some banded, better ac than banded
less weight) you could even try going into Runnyeye and auctioning for this,
the people in there are nearly always just farming the boss drops.

If you are going to auction in the bazarr, here's a hint, auction for an
upgrade on banded, mention your race and class and then add that you are not
twinked so please don't offer items amounting to 1000's of plat (or
something like that) This isn't to stop people wasting your time offering
you BE arms for 5k but in the hope that some high level has got "junk" in
the bank or back he was looking to get rid of, the search for a deserving
low level character is often harder than getting their own quest armour ;ï¿½)

Oh and Trolls CAN wear Bronze (large) amour. Are you sure it was large?
