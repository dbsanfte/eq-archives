It continues to be false, even though it was false before when
you said it.  A Cheal that heals to full HP is NOT the same when
it means the tank will last another minute, while the backup tank
healed to full HP is only going to last 30 seconds on it.

And monks no longer have vastly better damage mitigation than
warriors, so no longer is healing them more efficient due to them
taking less damage, even though the raw damage output of the mobs
is the same.  Earlier in the thread you intimated that you were
very aware of this... but suddenly you feign ignorance?

Monks don't take 1K damage while warriors take 2K, they take 2K
damage also... heck, they probably take 3K, with a pool half the
size of the warrior's.  

What we are saying here is that CHealing the warrior once or
twice is one thing, Chealing the ranger three or four times is
another, and that means that a CHeal is NOT a CHeal regardless of
your target; it doesn't last as long on the guy with less HP, and
if he also takes more damage per second from the mob that only
accelerates the degree to which it doesn't last as long.

If you have the mana pool to happily heal a warrior thru a given
pool, do you have 1.5 times that much mana, in order to heal the
ranger you got stuck with instead?  Or 2 times that mana, because
the ranger also takes more DPS?  Or 2.5 times the mana, because
you've lost the warrior's DPS and the ranger is now hitting from
the front so he's lost 15% of his normal damage output?  Wow, 2.5
times as much mana as you expected to need.  But the monk pulled
at "barely enough" (his opinion) because "enough is fine", even
though the cleric looked at the same situation and said "hold
pulls".

No, you did.  I said, quite trivially, that anyone, regardless of
class, might be the best choice of puller in some situation.  You
decided to argue that fact, despite the fact that even you were
able to come up with examples of when it was true that Your
magician was the best puller.  When someone agrees with me AND
tries to deny it, I have a very hard time letting go, too much
logic in my background I'm afraid.

I say the center point is mobile to make it clear that I'm not
fixated on 80M, and you get drawn offtarget into discussion of
how a higher center is even sillier.  Do you even notice the more
cogent point about how to determine where a good center point
is?  No, too busy.

But you're the one who brought up 9 mobs.  I didn't specify a
number of mobs, I specified a mere two or three times normal mana
use fluxuation.   If you normally bring 3 mobs at a time, then 9
mobs would be one way to get to three times normal.  But if the
warrior goes LD and a ranger has to take over, well I just
explained a minute ago in another thread how that could put you
at 2.5 times normal mana usage; dead center in my "two to three
times" window.  I don't even need to be that picky.  I'm saying
the fluxuation happens on a normal distribution curve, sure,
there is a normal range, but actual fluxuation can vary a good
deal more than that, and not on a "every sixth sunday if the moon
is full" basis.

IF there's an immediate benefit or even necessity to pull
something while a LOM but hopefully enough situation exists, then
pulling might be the way to go.  But to set it as policy for no
better reason than "I wanted to get the mission started 5 minutes
sooner" is foolhardy, unless of course your group is so uber that
30M is indeed within the "three times normal fluxuation" range.

Again, you have the idea, where you got it I have NO idea, that
your pace is different from the one I'm suggesting.

I'll try it in all caps

BOTH GROUPS PULL AT EXACTLY PRECISELY THE SAME RATE.

The only, only, only difference is that group B has 80M entering
the dungeon, while group A has 30M entering the dungeon.

I was willing to be more generous and say that group A pulls
faster for the first couple minutes in order to drop their mana
down to 30M, but that seems to only confuse you, because you keep
thinking its something to do with the pace, plus you yourself
keep arguing that entering the dungeon at FM is overly cautious.

If you failed that mission by just a little bit, then perhaps
with 50M more you could have won it; running out of time you
could start overpulling deliberately knowing the cleric has extra
mana to burn (as do the wizard, druid, shaman, necro, or other
manaburners you brought along, presumably all at 30M when you
zoned in)  The instant you either have to med or don't have the
mana to do something out of the ordinary, even if its only "pull
faster, times running out", you find that zoning in LOM actually
COST you time, even though you keep thinking it somehow gained
you time.  At best it gains you non mission time, but it doesn't
help at all against the timer, unless you zone in FM and spend
the mana inside.

If the paladin pulled so slow and steady as to affect your actual
pace, then he wasn't pulling at your normal pace, and so whatever
you did with him is quite the opposite of relevant to this
discussion.
