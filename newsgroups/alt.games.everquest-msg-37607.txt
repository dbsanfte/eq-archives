Do you do a lot of pick-up groups? This could account for your bad
experience. We've gotten to the point where I really don't remember the
last time I typed "looking for group" or "group looking for more". We've
just played steadily for a number of levels with a group of friends from
our guilds and our allied guilds. I'm not sure when was the last time
our cleric had to buy any symbol components with her own money. When we
make runs near gem merchants, she tells me what she needs and I buy
them. Plus, our ever present and faithful rogue seems to show up with
stacks of them after each town run to the point she's had to refuse
them. (He calls it his "entrance fee" he he. But then again, he's just a
really nice guy that way.) Others we play with seem to mysteriously show
up with them as well. As to the looting question, the cleric is 99% of
the time our group leader. We usually do alpha loot if we bother with it
at all, with the cleric calling the loot order and including herself in
the rotation, and always roll on any nice/valuable stuff on a NB4G
basis. Never seeems to be an issue. 
  But yeah, I can see how it could suck in a pick-up group where
everyone isn't really tight, and they don't have a vested interest in
keeping each other happy over the long run.
