Never seen any, anywhere here in the UK. So far as I was told they were
only sold in the USA.

Switch will be what they pick up on....Cirrus and MAestro are US origin,
now international, ATM systems though Im told some places recognise them
for swipes and Link is a building society origin network.

This is where those with Visa Delta cards come up on top (says a man with
Switch cards) as the systems recognise Visa Delta as a Visa system
card....my wife uses hers to order online whereas I have to drag out my
credit card if the place doesnt use Switch (ie isnt UK based)
