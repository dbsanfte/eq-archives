I've suspected that there was a dupe bug - prices on many servers have
skyrocketed on items like ornate molds/patterns.  Gradual increases I 
could see as a result of gradual influx of plat from farming, but these
happened nearly overnight.  A RL friend suddenly sold ornate vambraces
for 300k each, and they sold very quickly.

If they truly tracked it down, I hope they can also track the source of
some of the plat and eliminate the PP.  Yeah, some people who sold stuff
for ungodly amounts will lose out, but that plat has to leave the system
somehow.
