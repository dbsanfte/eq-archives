What is a good area and mob that is social and good for swarm kiting for a
41 bard?  I've tried it in GD with giants and wolves but the swarm did not
all jump on my pet after he started attacking.  Only the mob my pet attacked
returned the attack on my pet.  The others continued chasing me.  This is
after pulling them all with area aggro (running by them) to minimize aggro
so they would attack my pet.

Any ideas?

Thanks!

Rom
