"General mass"?  Thank you so much for deigning to come down to our
level and enlighten us.

Anyway...

>1)soloing is not really important for any class.

Yes, it is VERY important.  It means that a class is not dependant on
others to advance.  You don't have to invest time in getting guildies
together when you want to play to go where the hell ever and hunt.
You aren't gambling on the quality of players you find in a pick up
group.  If you wanna just log in at any random time, you can spend an
hour actually gaining exp without having to muck around.

Soloing is a HUGE advantage to any class.

>2a)Shamans are at least twice as good at soloing for raw exp

Bullshit.  Most of the shammy DoT's I've seen have about the same cast
time as a druids.  Like five or six seconds.  From the time a mob gets
into range and you start to cast to the time the cast ends, six
seconds means it IS going to be hitting you.  Add into the fact that
killing with one DoT is VERY slow, so you'll be using multiples, you
have that same cast time to wait through several times.  Even with
those nice HP buffs that shaman get, at any reasonable level soloing
that way isn't going to happen easily.

But druids can solo ANY mob they can get spells to land on starting at
level 1 and going all the way to 60, with little or no danger.  And
all because of one spell.  Snare.  Any druid.  Worshipping any god.

As much as snare is respected in game, it is indescribably HUGE to a
soloer.

>2b)When was the last time you saw a druid solo a dragon or rumblecrush ?

Never.  So what?  No, a dedicated, played the whole game solo soloer
won't be able to go on raids.  That's not the point.

I'm sorry, but my druid can make more exp quadding in CS at 53 than I
did in a friggin Karnors group at the same level.  And that's without
deaths.
