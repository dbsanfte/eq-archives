The current status of the Drelz camp, in Najena, explains why they
won't leave the fabled mobs up ;) 

Its a reminder of EQ back in the day, where Drelz was camped 24/7 with
people trying to kill steal and on a list for 24 hours in case she
drops the extremely rare jboots (or spawns at all.) 

All of those troubles are the exact reason they turned jboots in the
quest which it now is. Its why these are only temporary content,
they'd never design such new content, which was prone to making people
behave badly. Its a temporary fun thing, to not sweat or not take
seriously, as well as not staying away for 21 hours to try to get an
item.
