In the given example, there was really no reason that the buffs weren't 
given other than the cleric didn't think they were needed. If the caster 
is having a problem with mana or the buff would cause any sort of 
complication (hate creation buffs, for instance) then, sure, there is a 
reason not to cast them.

Don't tell me I can't have a HP buff just because you don't feel I need 
it though.  If I'm willing to reimburse for the components, it's not too 
much to ask. If you refused to cast a buff under these circumstances, one 
of us would be leaving the group, and I wouldn't care which.
