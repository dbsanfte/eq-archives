This has been covered.  However I will point out that any given proc
on jolting blades is, so I was told a few times on the
serverwide.ranger channel, 1/10th as effective as just casting jolt.

Jolt/Cinderjolt: -500 aggro
JBV Proc: -50 aggro

...something like that.

Also note that jolting blades does not stack with the Call of ###
line, so you will not be able to add a proc to your weapons.  Of
course in cases where you would want the extra insurance (public raids
maybe?) you wont want an extra proc anyway.

Personally, I can remember using jolting blades exactly once, and
never again after that.  Besides, it's a damn conjuration spell and it
too me for friggen *ever* to get conjuration up.

Force of nature is also on the CoE line, for all intents and purposes.
 It will not stack with CoE, CotRathe, Warder's Proection, or
Protection of the Wild.

The difference between the spells is that FoN will add a little extra
attack (a good thing) as well as (IIRC) an extra 3 hp per tic.  CoE
will do neither.  I don't recal FoN adding AC.

Anyway, final point is that if you want to maximize your attack
rating:
Outdoors: Wolf form, CoE
Indoors: FoN

The spell you will want that does stack with CoE is Strength of
Nature, and later Stength of Tunare.  These are upgrades to Nature's
Precision.  They add more to the attack rating and *also* add HP. 
However because they add HP, they don't stack with the Brell's line
cast by Paladins (sigh).  You will get frustrated soon, as you find
that every time that damn Pally recasts his group Brell's spell, you
have to click it off and recast SoN.
