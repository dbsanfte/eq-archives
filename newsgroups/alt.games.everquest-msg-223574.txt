Corel Office is feature overkill for the average user. Microsoft Office 
is 5% more useless features, and 10x the price.

OpenOffice is 90% of MS Office at zero acquisition cost, the greatest 
cost of an Office Suite, as maintenance costs of an office suite, beyond 
periodic upgrades (and in Microsofts case 'service packs', and 'critical 
updates'), is neglible.

Explain to me why companies are all loaded up with Office XP? Is 
everybody truly stupid and willfully ignorant? Or is something a little 
more complicated at work here?

Because on the surface of it... Office XP is relative dismal value no 
matter how you slice it... unless you are actually using some of the 
most advanced features available only in the enterprise editions... 
which is but a tiny fraction of MS Office users.
