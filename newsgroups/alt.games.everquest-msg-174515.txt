So the new Gold edition is not available here at all ? I was just
about to send them a message back asking if they could source the
latest version.

Actually I see that the US gold edition is $50 US.....which is around
$100 AUS ..... I can buy the old gold and the PoP expansion both for
$50 each so it's going to cost the same anyway. Still not happy about
the cost of the clients though :)

Anyone want to buy a maxed out UO account full of wealth and decadence
? :)
