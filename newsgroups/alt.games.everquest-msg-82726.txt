Do you have the logs where "GM said .... it was their bad"? Because I'd
love to see them, and personally I think it's BS.

Most likely explanations for this:
First possibility, you /camped and walked away from the computer and
didn't realize you got jumped by something and it killed you before you
cleanly logged out. I'm assuming this was some new ubertwink you just
created, since above level five your corpse wouldn't have decayed in
four days offline. So most anything wandering around in Butcherblock
could gank you pretty easily. Lesson learned: Don't twink pre-level five
characters. You're asking for heartache.

Second, and even more likely since you say the corpse was in a different
area, figure out which of your room-mates, relatives, friends, etc. has
access to your username and password. They probably decided to log on
your character and have fun with you for a bit, then panicked when they
got you killed, logged off, and aren't telling you.

While it's not 100% *completely* impossible that this was the result of
some glitch in the code, the odds of it being so, and thus being
Verant's fault, are slim and none. And slim has his luggage packed and
is at the bus station.
