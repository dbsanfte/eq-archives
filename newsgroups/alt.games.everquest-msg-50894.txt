One way that ensures the price doesnt drop beyond a certain point....
Create a vendor that actually offers sensible prices for items.
The game is so full of shit... trivial loot code, nodrop items, lore items
(ok this makes sense in a *few* cases), and vendors that try to rip you off
to the point that they would go out of business if it were a real world.
On a more general level, static item drops make little sense to me,
especially when the item isnt available elsewhere. Is the mob supposedly
making the item itself? If not, where does it get this item that it always
turns up with.
