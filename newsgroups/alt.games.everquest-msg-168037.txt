I've only just spotted this thread. What is supposed to be the problem with
Matrox G400 and eD glasses? They worked perfectly on my Matrox card. The
problem is that like others here, the novelty of 3D glasses soon wore off,
it all felt a bit naff wearing them ! But hey be fair,the Matrox card was
not the problem.
