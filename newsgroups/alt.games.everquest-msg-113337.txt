OMG it looks like you copied those straight from my log.

Got a good one last night. I am waiting for the spires in DL
to port me to the moon:

d00d: "Hey can you tp me to gd plz?"
Me: "No sorry" << (standard answer, polite and to the point, I 'try' never explain
myself.)
d00d: "Cmon plz? I'll pay"
Me: "No sorry"
d00d: "Why not? I'll pay"
Me: "Because I am waiting for the moon port and I don't want to miss it."
d00d: "but you can port back and catch the next one its only 15 min."
Me: .....
d00d: "Plz"
Me: "look why don't you just spire port up to the moon and then port down to GD?"
d00d: "that would take too long."
Me: "But its only 30min"
d00d:"asshole"
/ignore d00d

This conversation was greatly edited for clarity and reduced. He went on and
on for 10 min while I was sitting in the spires.




As a side note: Why don't all of us druids get together and build a friggin' stone
ring on the moon please! I'll bring the mortar.
