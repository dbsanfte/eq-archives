I saw the Terrorantula once. My Warrior was in his mid 30's farming
spiders in SRo for....well, doesn't really matter what I was farming.
No reason for you to go to SRo and kill all the spiders.

Anyways, I'd just downed another spider and was looking around for my
next victim. I see one and start running towards it. After a few
seconds, I notice that there's something different about this spider.
It seemed awfully....BIG. So I stop and click on it: Terrorantula.
Never heard of it. Cons yellow, ready to attack. For those of you who
don't play Warriors, soloing a yellow con (or a white con for that
matter) is guaranteed suicide so I decided to keep my distance. Just
then, he turns and starts running straight for me. On my way to zone,
I happened past a group who were camping that guy in SRo that everyone
camps and they were happy to take him off my hands. Pretty scary, but
I saw the Terrorantula and lived to tell the tale.
