Nope, easily soloable.  I know someone who got to his 50's primarily
solo'ing, problem was he sucked when it came to grouping.  Just experiement
with what your songs do and what you like doing best.

Bards are typically the least played character on all servers, but for PvP.
They can get really tedious sometimes, but I relieve that by playing my alts
for a few weeks.

If you want a true challange then go for a bard.  Just do all the rest of us
decent bards a favor and do your research.
