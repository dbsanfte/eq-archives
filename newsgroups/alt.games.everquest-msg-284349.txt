When the time comes and there are no-mez adds then the Knights shine.
Snap agro keeps squishies from being pulped.  Unpulped quishies are happy
squishies.  Same thing goes for the healer/slowers etc.  

You should take some time and learn the joys of SK agro/snare/FD pulling
which does come in quite handy in places like the Arena in Kael.

On to Phini from yer later post, he can be single grouped, even back
in pre-Kunark days.  There's a little "cubby" down at the bottom of
phini's pit and if there are no see inviso swirlspines hanging about you
can get your group into that cubby and single pull Phini to there.
Fun fight that way. :)
