Well, it is *precisely* what I've been talking about.

Uh, no, I'm not. Although I do agree with your opinion on that
scenario.

It's not porting for tips. It's just removing the marketing and
haggling from the process. In medieval (sp?) times, if you wanted a
priest to come and bless your home but were dirt poor, you didn't
offer a couple of eggs from one of the ten hens in your hen house for
his trouble. You gave him one of the hens or as close to what you
thought to be a fair offering as you could. Sure, he would probably do
it for free if you had nothing to give, but if you could pay a fair
amount, you did. He didn't walk into your home wearing a sandwich
board listing his rates. As I see it, this is the spirit players
should strive for in the act of porting/being ported, and I believe
this is the way it was envisioned by game designers.

See above.

Yet you still feel the person who under-donated is a cheapskate, or
wrong for offering so little. That is my point. It is wrong to take
advantage when you are perfectly able to pay a fair amount.

Sure. Why not take out one of the last genuine role-playing aspects of
the game? Actually, I'm not suggesting not porting people who *can't*
pay or even people who grossly underpay. I am merely saying that those
who intentionally underpay when they are perfectly capable of paying a
fair amount are committing a dishonest act and are therefore in the
wrong.
