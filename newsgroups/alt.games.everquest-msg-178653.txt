Just picked up one of these for 250pp (thanks to whomever it was that didn't
check their prices.  I'm sure it was meant to be a steal @ 2500pp
considering they tend to go for over 3000pp on Drinal) and can't find
anything relating to the "brass modifier" it possesses.
Anyone here able to enlighten me?

TIA,
Sean...
