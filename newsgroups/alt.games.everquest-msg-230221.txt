True, but don'tcha think it's punishment enough to have spent the time 
required to log out, load up a newsreader, post a message, wait for a 
reply, load up the newsreader again, read the reply, close it, load up EQ 
(apparently interminable loading time), select server (apparently 
interminable loading time), select character (pretty hefty loading time), 
and play?

It's only Pamela that got inconvenienced, by the look of things!

No, I probably haven't got all the facts.

Believe me, I can live with it.
