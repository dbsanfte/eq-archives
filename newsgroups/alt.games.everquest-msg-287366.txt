Nah. I find myself soloing often enough, but there are groups to be
had. As long as you're an appropriate level for the zone you're in,
people will find a use for you. The only time I have a bit of trouble
is when I need to put together a complete group for a specific task,
like my epic or something.

Also, it's about to get a lot easier to play AA catch-up. They're
getting ready to implement an AAxp curve that will give nice bonuses
to AAxp (like double) for those with fewer AA's.

That sounds good but they have done a lot that's hurt the game for me too 
which that wouldn't begin to address. I haven't played for a bit now and it 
seems like each break I return from, the return stay is shorter. :-(

I don't like the damned card game being foisted on players ingame. I don't 
like the damned cards dropping off mobs and the fact that it is little more 
than a way to extract more revenue from players wanting the ingame toys. 
Most who buy cards don't even play the game. They want the mounts and 
familiars and potions, etc. I truly hate all that. Once upon a time 
EverQuest was a entirely an online ROLE PLAYING GAME. Gems was one thing. 
LoN is just a bit much, a lot much. That's how I feel anyway and I know from 
friends I am not alone in my disdain over that move. Smed talks business so 
constantly he forgets about the fact that the entertainment needs to be of 
the very highest possible quality first and the money will flow from that 
accordingly. Say what you will about WoW but that sort of thing is something 
Blizzard would not even consider, just as they reject RMT, etc. By the 
numbers it appears Blizzard must be doing something right whether its one's 
cup of tea or not.

I don't like the ridiculously complex armor that is now battery powered and 
for which you need a calculator to consider the power factor across gear and 
weapons and remove and replace a damned battery all the time which one has 
to run missions to have currency for, else buy it. Battery powered epic 
stats armor. Oh my God...

The game needed more to refine and improve what was always great about it 
from the start and not constantly invent new and needless complexity with 
each new expansion which seems to be the new norm of late. I for one am 
sorry to see that.

I have never wanted to say this but I now see EverQuest as I once loved it 
is gone and the game as a whole is well on the way to fading into a UO-like 
obscurity.

I let my "investment" in my main and my nostalgia for fun, friends and times 
gone by hold me for years but its just not enough while I watch the game go 
to hell in a handbasket.

Such is the end of the road for MMOs I guess, not just EQ but any of them as 
they age, populations dwindle, new ones come along, etc. The world we hoped 
might never go away in mind largely already has. It pains me to say all 
that. I loved EverQuest and I spent more time than I would want to admit to 
in Norrath over some six years. Like someone else said my choices now are 
play alone or grind till I can play with others. Neither is what the game 
was ever meant to be and I guess I am simply not willing to pay those kind 
of dues in terms of time to get to where the fun is.

They'd need to give away copious amounts of XP to fix that and in doing so 
would of course be breaking a lot else. It's too late. It's terminal. :-(
