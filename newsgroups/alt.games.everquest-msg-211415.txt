	No, in the 30s any HP advantage is small, and there is no mitigation
advantage.

	Ranger tanking issues do not begin until the high 40s at the earliest.
That will be put off significantly depending on equipment.  With mostly
Kunark-era gear (significantly Tolan's legs and BP and both epics) and
Velious-era magic I was able to tank in Sebilis in the high 50s with no
significant increase in downtime.  Last time I played (I'm off EQ for a month
while I try SWG...quick review: combination of the worst parts of AC, EQ and
UO) I was able to tank in BoT on a bad pull, but I wouldn't want to do that on
a regular basis.
