[snip]

Shadowbane is a game I wouldn't poke with a sharp pointy stick, let alone
play.  I really, really, really hate PvP.  I had more than my fill of it in
my 30 minute career in Ultima Online.  (During which, I was PKed three
times, once while standing next to a guard.  And the third time, they
killed the cat I was attempting to tame, just for kicks.)  I don't care how
they set it up, random PKing by roving bands of disposable twinks will be
the rule in two months, bet on it.

Anyway, have they even found a publisher yet?  Do they have a release
date?  It's not on the list of "coming attractions" at my local software
store, and that list is optomistic enough to include both Warcraft III and
NeverWinter Nights.  I'll believe ShadowBomb is out about three weeks after
it happens.
