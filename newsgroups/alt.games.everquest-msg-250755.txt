I hadn't heard that armor part.  Grouped I rarely bother with the armor 
because its a pain, can't believe the bag it comes in isn't 100% WR! 
Solo, I generally gear up the pet with everything I can think of though, 
and have a couple Gift bags full of spares on me.   This means going 
back to LDoN's pissy exp, unless perhaps that was just a doldrums from 
55 to 60.  How many points do you get for a success in a level 60 LDoN?

I have the ward, he doesn't seem to proc that stun very often, but he's 
a decent fighter in a group.  Haven't soloed with him yet.  I've found 
water pets in the past to be a good deal of trouble, most situations 
keeping them on the back of mobs is difficult unless the MT is 
cooperating... and most MT's seem to be too lazy to keep that up.  All 
things being equal in the past, I've mostly gone back to Air and given 
up on the BS plan.  How much more impressive is the 62 BS, in terms of DPS?

I have the 61 version of this, haven't seen it proccing much though 
(hmm, have I seen it proc at all?  Maybe I have something turned off so 
I can't see the message...)

I have the 61 belt, haven't been using it in groups though because 250hp 
and some AC doesn't seem to matter much if the pet isn't tanking... and 
because the mobs are hitting for 500 points so if my pet starts getting 
beat on my best response is to back him off and kite the mob till they 
reestablish control.  Didn't remember that it also has Dex, which would 
boost the proc rates.

I do have the muzzle, I'm only at Burnout IV though at the moment.  Hmm, 
considering that, if grouped with an enchanter/shaman are there cast 
hastes that are better than IV?  I seem to be grouping with people from 
60 to 65 these days.

Soloing I heavily relied on healing in the past, coming from a Cleric 
background I strongly believe in keeping things alive instead of having 
to summon (rez) them again and then buff them back up (and in the case 
of pets, gearing them back up too, something my cleric never had to do 
with dead warriors).  I have some kind of 60 pet heal, not sure if its 
one of the HOTs or a real heal though, since I haven't cast any heal at 
all since my return.

I've had this one since my 40s I think, and love it for air pets (which 
I've used a lot) plus see invis mobs in a few places like Velks (one of 
my principle haunts for several levels).  Most of the night blind seem 
to already have vision devices of their own by now, not like the low 
levels where the Heatstone/Coldstone were looked on with such joy.

I have the bracelet, not the bauble, and no MPIV item either, meaning 
that the 61 spells I cast all have to be looked at with that in mind 
when comparing efficiency.

I've always sneered at RC, as reagent costs are low as it stands, and a 
10% chance of lowering them strikes me as a joke.  I guess I'll feel 
differently when COHing whole raids around and so forth... except that 
to be honest, I hardly blinked at Peridot costs as a cleric buffing 
raids with BOA and Virtue (no MGB HOV for me, either) so its hard to 
stint at a few 5pp pearls.  If RC is available as an augment, instead of 
having to sacrifice an actual item slot for it, might be a "why not" 
sort of thing... does the augment drop though or does it cost LDoN 
points?  Not sure I'm willing to work for it!

Spell haste seems to me not only a way to increase DPS over the short 
term, but also to increase mana regen when indoors.  Outdoors, of 
course, I've got my Drogmar to sit upon, so no worries, but indoors, its 
stand, nuke, sit unless aggro is particularly nasty, and shorter cast 
times means less time standing and possibly missing med tics.

I recall thinking the same thing when I read up on these last winter, no

This is a new one to me.  EC via LDoN points, or buy off a vendor in the 
tunnel?  What level is it?  Might go answer those for myself before you 
see this message, of course.
