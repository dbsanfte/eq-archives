Ok, I am now more confused then before. Why is this a exploit? CotH is
supposed to remove agro (if you can get it to land before the cleric gets
summoned and dies), it sounds like they made great use of the tools Verant
gave them to manage agro.

Does being positioned under the bridge somehow prevent the mob from
summoning?
