I was once cussed out because I killed the tower spawn in mid-afternoon.
The guy wanted me to wait till 8pm.  He seemed pretty sure of himself and
even went so far as to complain to my guild.  That part is because I killed
the tower spawn anyway because he wouldn't tell me why I shouldn't.  Anyway,
I figured out why and tried it.  First time the AC spawned later that night
at 5am, but I got ksed.  Second time he never spawned the whole night.
Third time he spawned about 9pm.  So I guess that the tower spawn is a large
part of it.

The second trick I know of is if you can't kill him fast then train him to
the south end of the zone so the ksers can't find him.  By the time they
tracked me down the AC was nearly half gone so they just ended up helping
me.
