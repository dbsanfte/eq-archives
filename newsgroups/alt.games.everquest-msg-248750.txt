I never said I didn't play it. ;) In fact I do organize and lead raids
for my guild. Granted it's a very small guild. We have 30 people max on
a raid if we have FULL HOUSE. But I do enjoy it immensely. Searching a
target and researching it to have a strategy and see it working. It's
great. And I'm thankful for it. But on the other hand I do see people
crashing in PoK when they die. Because their bindpoint is PoK as it has
always been. Trying to login again just to witness the next crash and so
on.
Loosing to a tough mob is one thing. But keep in a good mood facing 
technical obstacles requires iron nerves. Just yesterday we had a fun
"raid" with just 9 people in VP. Shaman couldn't get one of the mobs
slowed because it was in the floor!
I think all of you have experienced the same things. So if SOE doesn't
do something against these annoyances it will loose customers.

P.S.: Oh and OoW is when I make my decision whether to play further or
just sign off. Not that I will by it but just watching what lvl70 does
bring to the table I'll decide.
