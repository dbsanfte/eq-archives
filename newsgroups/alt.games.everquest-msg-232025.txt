The same thing was happening to me in Plane of Disease fighting the
Tsetsian flies last week. I wasn't fearing or snaring but several
times when the mob got to low health it just vanished leaving my pet
standing there wondering where it's dinner had just gone. As I still
had it targetted I could see its health slowly going back up each
time.

It didn't go back to it's spawn point - I know as I was pulling them
all from the same smallish area - and it never did come back and
re-aggro me.
