OH man... I remember camping Dyllin Starsine... popping into the smugglers
den often and repeatedly to see if he's there and uncamped.
First time, I was with a guildie who was *also* after the missing page.  We
killed him, and then my guildie went to log on as his character who needed
it.  The page poofed away in front of my face while the rest of us were
waiting for him to arrive.... seems my guildie had his alt camped much
further away than the rest of us realized.. Doh!!!  The price for trying to
be an honorable guildmate.

So one big faction among the corrupt guards of my home city hit for killing
Dyllian, but no page.  Hope Lt. Dagerok (sp?) doesn't find me....

Then checking back some time later...solo this time... I go up to check, and
I find this druid sitting waiting for Dyllin to pop.  I ask him how long
it's been...how long since the last spawn so I can set my watch for a future
spawn.  Then Dyllian spawns in front of my face.  The druid doesn't move.  I
wave, hail, poke, dance and jig, snap my fingers in front of the druid's
face... no response.  The guy's sitting there asleep, and there's Dyllin,
standing there telling me he has no spare change.  :-)

I wait and wait for the druid to wake up.  I probe my guildies for advice...
they said take Dyllin.  After half an hour or so of agonizing, I decide the
druid's gone nighty-night long term, and won't be back for hours.  With
unease, my cleric followed Dyllin around his walk-about.  When he was
alone...away from his bandit buddies, down by the water, I finally got him.

It was the first blue non-undead mob my cleric had been able to solo for
several levels (I had just gotten and learned to use Holy Might...makes a
big diff!).  Another faction hit, but I had the page.  I run to Qeynos, get
the last page, then TA-DA!  I have the fabled and coveted Testament.  Time
to run back to Highpass to rejoin the Orc Camp so I can level again!

Several hours after that, I noticed the sleeping druid finally left the
zone.  I wonder to this day if he had finally gone LD, or if he woke up and
read all the scrolling text of when I tried to wake him and then later
attacked his camp......
