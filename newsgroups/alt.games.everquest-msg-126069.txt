It's been a LONG time, but I was once told by a GM (not a guide) that
the orcs in Highpass were FFA.  Granted, this was before Kunark, so
even if that were true at the time, it might be changed now.

On an barely tangential note, the Shralok Pack that I got whilst
hunting in Highpass almost three years ago is still marked PENDING
Lore.  Think they forgot about it by now?
