XP here on three machines, all seeing the same problem.

1. after going LD and dropping back to the server login, getting to the 
character selection screen most often causes the crash (would you like 
to send details .....) and then drops to desktop

2. sometimes it lets you choose a character and then crashes 20 seconds 
into the game

3. logging out after long single character sessions sometimes causes the 
dialog and a crash to desktop

All new after the last patch (and very frustrating, considering a 
problem on level3.net's network is causing us to spend some days going 
LD every 5 minutes, today being one of them :(       )
