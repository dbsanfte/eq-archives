	There is a bug (present from Day One) that will sometimes make the corpse
of a player in your group appear on your tracking list if that player does not
re-enter the zone.

	You can't track your own corpse, and you can't normally track corpses at
all.  Logically it would make sense that you could find the tracks the guy
made while he was still alive and follow them to where he died, but Verant
wants corpse tracking to be the province of Bards, Necromancers and
ShadowKnights.  According to the game's web pages at Sony, Tracking has a
magical component to it, so I suppose the logic is that it can only detect
living or psuedo-living (undead, golems, etc.) things.
