If you were as good at determining my intent, gleaning the foundation of 
my words from reading them as you contend Kaev, then you would 
understand this comment rather than being baffled by it.  Considering I 
had no intention of accusing the poster of defending thievery I took 
Dan's comment as an unwarranted attack designed to deviate attention 
from my actual point, similar to the "why do you hate America so much?" 
we've been subjected to in recent months.  As you would clearly see if 
you had such insight into the workings of my mind as you seemed to 
think, this rather perturbs me.

Perhaps this pattern of intelligence and integrity should have led you 
to question your own interpretation a bit more rather than assuming that 
in this case it was a sudden departure on my part.  Certainly my 
insistence to the contrary should have counted for something considering 
that history.

I have control only over what I write, not how others perceive the words 
once they have left my control.  Despite my best intentions and 
application of my language skills, misinterpretation is clearly a 
potential result.  Even if a thousand men told me that is what they read 
in my words it would not change my intent.  Comparisons are odious and I 
clearly was guilty of making one ambiguous enough that it could be 
interpreted as you did, but that crime being admitted still fails to 
render my intent other than to point out the absurdity of a cheating 
program being good for EQ.  Note the first sentence "How absurd.", which 
gives context to the sentence that followed.

Just today I've seen statistic players touting the same theme and I 
remain unchanged in my opinion that cheating programs are bad for 
gaming.  A game developer determines what information is in the players 
hands and what should remain hidden.  This constitutes the rules of a 
given game and going outside that is cheating in my opinion and bad for 
everyone except the cheater perhaps.  No matter what good is claimed to 
come from such efforts it remains at heart a bad thing.  While on an 
individual basis some would claim gains, I contend that the game as a 
whole suffers in the hands of those who reduce everything to numbers, 
despite that being the underlying nature of the game.  Such is what I 
was attempting to express with my poor comparison to thievery being good 
for the economy.  So I was coming down on the poster for supporting 
cheating programs in the name of the good they provide and nothing more.

So you are saying that you'd come to expect me to be a liar?  If you see 
something other than what I intended in my words I can do no more than 
tell you that you are misinterpreting them.  If my word on that subject 
means nothing then my word on any subject means nothing.  Ever wonder 
why I don't post much here (or anywhere on usenet) anymore?  This thread 
is the reason for that.  I mean why bother speaking at all if its 
meaningless?  These days when I consider posting I remind myself of the 
futility inherent in human communication and generally decide on 
silence.  Obviously this post is an exception to that generality.

Yes, as I said in that thread, they do have the fact that I find both 
statements absurd in common.  Other than that they are not equal, but on 
that basis alone they are.  My intent was to expose the illogic of 
saying bad things are good because they produce some good.  To my 
thinking bad things are bad despite any good that comes from them.

Read what I said earlier in this post on the subject of accusations and 
republicans.  Just because you can't understand something doesn't mean 
it doesn't make any sense and just because you do think you understand 
something doesn't mean you do.  I'll leave you with that as a closing 
thought along with an invitation to read the quote below my sig in this 
post, I consider them words to live by.
