No, it's a perspective of what happens when a nonskilled druid takes
on more than they can handle. You know, all those people kiting mobs
all over everyone else in a zone and doing other things that endanger
or hamper other people trying to play there? The whole dr00d
stereotype didn't come from the skilled druids, some of which CAN
handle four large mobs without ruining the fun for others...

*beating myself up for not paying attention last night and going to
see the druid botb when it started during my play hours... it would
have been fun to see that*
