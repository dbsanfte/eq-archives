I've only heard that rumor a couple times, for the most part people seem to
thing that pulse mana happens when the song completes; in particular,
consensus has been that multiple bards singing pulse mana "stack" while
obviously the cantata line for mana regen does not.

Its possible that pulse mana stacks and yet somehow only really gives mana on
the tic; confusing but possible.

If so, then there would be no reason to speed pulse nothing but mana, and
some of the benefits of running cantata/pulse twists would be reduced, but
with the exception of the pure mana one, you'd still want to run much the
same thing;

Cantata, Mana, Mana, Cantata  to keep both pulse and cantata running at full
speed, and so forth.  Not sure how you'd manage to time the casts so you only
come out with a three twist even though recasting when song completes would
run a clean four twist.

Looking forward to the report
