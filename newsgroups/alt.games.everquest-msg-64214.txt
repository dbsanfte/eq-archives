Thats easy.
Theyre gonna repeat the Rivervale mistake, so some kind of pet/slave in 
the Val Shir start village aggro just about everything that get near, 
attack random people after the original aggro maker zone out, and when 
killed give faction hits to everyone in a radius of around 100 meters.

To top it off, they will have messed the faction system off, so 1 
faction hit make you KOS to around 6 random NPCs in the village.

(got random faction hits from not even being near Mangler in Rivervale 
so many times that i couldnt trade)
