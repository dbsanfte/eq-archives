But isnt that the way most people play eq right now?  When I see someone 
else has hit a mob already I back off.  This game just enforces that 'rule'. 
When I used to kill hill giants with my wizard I first started out with a 
huge nuke.  Too often in the middle of casting some warrior would run up and 
tag the giant first.  So I started tagging with my instaclickie mr debuff. 
Was I being rude?
