The problem comes from the fact that Enchanters slows are Magic based. and
the Shamans a dieses based.  There are mobs at higher levels that can not be
slowed by one, but can by the other.  THere was a great list of Non slowable
and Class specific slowable mobs.  SOE did this to make shaman's more
valuable on raids, and to allow the Enchanters to do there other job.  In
the end you need both.

The sulution I would like to see. ( I had this discusion with my guild  we
are PURE DARK - no x-teaming scum alowed)  If they would make it so every
class had atleast one race on each team that could that was allowed.  I
would love to be an Iksar Ranger.  THe problem with this is the diety
requirments of some of the classes.  From the dark prespective all of our
problems stem from Tunare..  As a darky we don't get Bards, DroooDz,Rangers
or Paladins(no need for the last one.  Do lighties realy need them?).  I
think it is time for Miss Gooddy Too Shoes -(Tunare)- to get it on with
Rallos Zek and make us a new Sub-Diety, one that could be a
Ranger/Drood/Bard but hated in but the dark lands.  The bard always had me
wondering, obviously we as darks lack culture, or we would have these
tellers of tales.  And for PvP not having tracking will get you killed, not
to mention the disc. of a ranger.(Weapon Shield.  the best combo agro
builder ever, as long as you have an AoEtaunting Warior)

OK.  I have vented.  I just wish there was a way to actualy talk to the
techies that are responsable for this stuff.
