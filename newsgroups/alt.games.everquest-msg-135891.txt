Number one it is a good book, number two I do not think the US should have
ever gotten involved. I think Europeans should have handled the problem. Hey

Ok shine some light  -tell what you have been reading. I am game for some
more reading always looking for more reading. But the other side Ok - try "
A Just Response" or "Rogue States" by Noam Chomsky. However, I do not agree

You obviously know nothing about African americans so quit pretending. .
