Enraged Amy Knights, at the very top of the pyramid.  The staff is thier
common drop.  The rare is supposedly a very nice mask that our Paladin was
drooling over.  We got two staffs, no masks from killing them. There are
some *very* nice items all over that little area.

The smallest group we ever took up there was a 65 warrior, 63~ish Paladin,
65 Druid and 65 Enchanter (bot).   The kills were not fast, but we defeated
all comers, so to speak. ; )   Adding the 57~ish Rogue  or the 63~ish Rogue,
(or both!) sped up kills drasticly.

Unless they've made the area significantly easier in the last few months,
you should not try it without some form of mez. (Enchanter would be best,
but a high level bard might be able to do it.  Must be able to mez level 60
mobs.)  I very much doubt root parking will be enough, no matter how good
you are.  First, you have very little room to manuver once you start
climbing the pyramid.   Then for added fun, mobs in 4c have two very bad
AE's.   The shaman lizards AE Bane of Thule, which is an unresistable slow
and DoT.    The necromancer lizards AE a poison rain for 3x (several
hundred, I forget exactly how much) damage.  It can be resisted, but not
easily.

Both are significantly harder than your average lizard (which isn't all that
easy.  Very high AC mobs).   If you get both at once...  unless you mez
fast, the AE poison one will kill you, while the AE slow one drops your
melee damage to almost nothing, so neither one ends up dying.
