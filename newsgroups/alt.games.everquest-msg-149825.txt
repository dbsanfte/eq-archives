I have been in Lower Guk for the last week now, either soloing my pally or
duoing with various friends that I have managed to drag into the darkness
from their sunny xp spots in Dreadlands/Jaggedpine etc.
I have been trying to get an SMR for my chanter while I was down there, but
there has been Paladin01 camping the Arch Magus for the whole week, except
for one time when myself and a chanter friend got to the camp early. Man!
was Paladin01 pissed off when he arrived. The AM only popped once in the 5
hours we were there, and didnt drop the robe when he did :(
Last night I was down there with a monk friend, we killed the ritualist on
the way to the basement and were just invising up at the bottom of the
ladder, when we here "Paladin01 shouts: Train to zone, Move it or lose it!".
We sat and watched him run by when we see, bringing up the rear of the
smallish train, the AM. So of course, we grabbed him out, and beat the crap
outta him. He dropped the robe! :)
I sorta felt bad about it afterwards, I mean, this paladin has been camping
the guy for forever, even the monks camping raster felt pity for him.
Once someone calls a train, the train is FFA, right?
