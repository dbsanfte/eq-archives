Visine works by stimulating the sympathic nerve system, making the
little blood vessels in your eyes constrict. The chemical has the
exact same effect on other structures in the body of it reaches them,
but the eye will only absorb a little bit and it'll pretty much be
used up locally. You can get some trouble if you overdose, but it
still won't be in an area designed to absorb stuff, and won't be in an
area with vital organs.
Put a few drops (overdose for eyes)  in the digestive tract, which is
designed to absorb stuff and also has blood vessels leading to much
more interesting areas than the eyes, and you've got trouble.
