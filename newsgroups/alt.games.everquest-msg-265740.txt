Interactivity doesn't have to be lost. In fact showing up to a dungeon 
seeing its occupied and leaving to find an empty one is no better than 
instancing in terms of interactivity.

But how, kill the same stuff I've been killing and hope a better X 
drops. At least the way it is now, I can go -there- to get an upgrade, 
and then -there- to get an upgrade beyond that.

The problem with the way it is now, is that I can skip up to the end-2 
or 3, and skip most of the progressiion... not all of it, but most of 
it.

You are right. LDoN as implemented did allow endless repitition of the 
same simple grind, and it was a terrible thing to do to the game. But 
that isn't instancings fault; its LDoN's. They could have implemented 
2000 cookie cutter non-instanced LDoN dungeons at various levels and it 
would have been just as awful.

Perhaps items that required you to collect flags from the various 
encounters to keep people moving. (Not a 'progression' per se, but 10 
different scripted instances to get a nice item, doable in any order.)

I agree we want to keep people grinding ldon's for 30 levels. But then 
PC is even worse a cesspool good for 20 levels and its non-instanced.

That's where the setting challenges for myself come in.

> when there are people in X you still demand X all to yourself?

Actually, I don't although I do think that people in X shouldn't 
preclude me doing what I want to do in X. (See my micro instanceing 
proposition for that scenario...e.g. a City of Mist like non-instanced 
dungeons, with a micro-instanced encounter for the really contested 
stuff.)

If Y and Z are just as good, but not as convenient. Then they aren't 
just as good. :)

Seriously though, if every interesting encounter in EQ were spliced into 
3 places it would either be 3 times the size, or they'd start over 
lapping stuff. 3 times the size will cost a chunk of money... and if 
they overlap... so that today's X from X, Y from Y, and Z from Z are 
x,y,x from X, xyx from y, and xyz from Z... well then it will lose a lot 
flavour.

That's a bit of a strawman. I agree LDoN is stupid. I don't think LDoN 
is representative of the best that can be accomplished with instancing.

In my vision of a fantasy world there aren't usually heroes that close 
at hand in the heart of a dungeon the band of heroes is seeking to 
cleanse without a very good reason... ie they came with the band of 
heroes.

Beleive it or not, I do like bumping into other people in the world, all 
over the place, I like bumping into them in the plains, in the cities, 
on the beaches of gunthak, and the at the ports and spires and even in 
dungeons... just not at contested spawns.

Its may be more 'worldly' to show up to kill Negafen and find his lair 
empty.... but its certainly not more fun, and I at least don't find that 
experience engaging or immersive.
