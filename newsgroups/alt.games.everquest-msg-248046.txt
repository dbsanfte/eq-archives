One day <??> of experience, but here is what I'm guessing is what
happened, based on what has happened to me. You lost connection which
dropped you back to the server selection screen. Since you were
asleep, you didn't do anything and, after a certain amount of time,
it then booted you back to the login screen.

That's what's been happening to me. I can't be at the character
selection screen for a long time or I get booted back to the login
screen and get that message. I also can't stay on the server selection
screen or I get booted back to the login screen and get that message.
I can, OTOH, be in-game and be afk for the same amount of time and
not get booted out of the game.
