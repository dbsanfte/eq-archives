They should (IMO) have left it unlimited, added decent search/sort UI to it,
and let people take on as much as they like.  I hear the reason they limited
it (late in Beta) was that it was causing lag to search hundreds of quests for
each player in a group that gets a kill to see if there's a match.  

I wish they'd fixed it by letting players deactivate quests as needed, and
reactivate them before actually performing the activity.

I've seen a number of people make this argument, and it's probably true up to
a point.  I know for me, it's painfully slow to solo, and almost impossible to
do most of the quests I find at my current level.  I can do quests that I've
had for a few levels and the mobs are green or light blue, but new
level-challenging quests often require a group or waiting a few levels to do.

I'm also very bored soloing, and it seems that XP gains are about half of what
I get in even a bad 3-person group.  

For me, and what I'd recommend to anyone considering EQ2, soloing is what you
do while looking for a group, or to kill a bit of time when you can't play
long enough to commit to a group.  Oh, and tradeskillers can spend a lot of
solo time.

If you like adventuring and killing, and don't want to group most of the time,
EQ2 likely is not the best game for you.  There are probably exceptions, but
the content design really is group-oriented/solo-possible rather than
group-or-solo-equal.

That's lucky for me, as I strongly prefer to group, both with friends and in
pickup groups.  In a game with easy soloing, it's sometimes hard to make new
friends and find people willing to put effort into coordinating and working
together.

Probably true.  Soloing is not impossible, just less efficient and (for me)
less rewarding.  Obviously, such a judgement depends on what you enjoy about
the game, but if you really don't like grouping I have a hard time believing
that EQ2 is the game for you.

A good duo is far more powerful than soloing.  Healer/tanks are the
core of an EQ group, with everything else optional.  The more the merrier,
but really once you get a fighter and a priest together, you have a group.

>Umm, no use for multiple predators?  How about doing damage? 

From what I've seen (not that much, admittedly), worries about stacking are
mostly unfounded in practice.  Almost everyone has decent DPS when not
engaged in some other role.  Unfortunately, if enough people think
differently, it becomes a problem in the game which is VERY difficult for a
designer to fix.
