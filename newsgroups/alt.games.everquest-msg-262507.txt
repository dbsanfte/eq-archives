No it doesn't.  Oh wait, yeah, it does.  Soon as a democrat gets elected
president and raises my taxes again.   =)

Nobody ever claims to be raising taxes to pay off the debt.  If they do, you
can quickly spot the lie when they start up new programs with the increased
revenue.  Since the debt isn't getting paid off no matter what, I'm all for
no tax increases.

You see, if a president ever actually had the plan to raise taxes in order
to pay off the debt, with a longer range plan of lowering taxes again after
it was paid down, they might actually be worth having as president.  I don't
see it happening within my lifetime.
