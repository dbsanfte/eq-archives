I would have to vehemently agree on the uneven-ness of the sounds.  Of
course I can't seem to wean myself off from the sound as you have.  I've
been in Oasis with my necro, and near the shoreline the waves are simply
deafening.  After fighting crocs by the shore for awhile I joined an orc
group in the alley.  The stupid ocean sound would not stop, even nowhere
near the shore.  I've had some sounds refuse to cease like this.
The sound of my own footsteps varies everytime I play.  I also hear that
bards can hear their instruments when they fire up songs.  My main is a bard
that I've never, ever heard a single instrument with in 41 levels.
