The only one I ever saw was a GM as a DE dragoon attack the auctioners in
the EC tunnel. He didn't last very long and I actually got in a few fire dd
spells myself. There were so many spells going off at once it looked like a
strobe light effect because it chopped the frame rate so far down. Since I
myself didn't die I thought it was all kind of cool. Wouldn't have wanted to
be the first couple of players the 'goon hit though.
