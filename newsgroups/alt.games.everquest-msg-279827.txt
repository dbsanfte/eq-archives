I'm equally sure nobody is suggesting they play with a philosophy of

Personally I doubt it. There aren't likely to be enough members playing 
at the same time at the same level to really be mounting lowbie raids. 
As cool as such a thing might be.

I don't see it running counter to anybody's goals at all. If you want to 
be rich, get rich, buy a horse ... whatever.

the way i'd see it... don't spend the money on what other players are 
selling in the bazzaar or elsewhere... and by extension avoid spending 
the money on stuff other players have dumped on npc merchants. In 
essense... avoid the "screwed-up" player economy, as much as possible.

Outside of that spending is fair game.

Welcome to EQ. The economy is busted. That's a reality. Many raiders 
have oodles of cash and literally nothing to spend it on. At one piont 
in EQs history plat lost all value at the end game... several pieces of 
gear were negotiated primarily by trade. Most tradeskills were 
essentially pointless, the npc vendors sold nothing of value, and the 
players who had items of value already had tons of plat and nothing to 
spend it on... the last thing they needed was more plat.

SOE has added enough plat sinks into the game to mitigate that 
somewhat... but i think the main reason you don't see a lot of items 
being negotiated for trade is that the truly good stuff is all no drop 
anyways.

I disagree. I'd say its reasonably easy. Going much beyond that though 
requires higher level drops... and lots of them :)

Heh... you haven't really thought this through yet have ya? :)

You'd think that but your only looking at it from YOUR perspective. Look 
at it from the perspective of thsoe you are selling too... wait for 
it... wait for it... DOH! Do you see it yet? You just undermined the 
whole reason they joined the guild.

I know it seems draconian but the rule almost has to be: players cannot 
buy gear from other players even within the guild. (Along with strict 
grouping and assistance restrictions between higher and lower level 
players. A bard at 15th level can finish his solro armour with a pair of 
40ths beside him after all... of course he won't have to do even that if 
he's buying acrylia gear from someone else anyways.

Yay for personal accomplishment!)

The only exception might be to establish some pools of tradeskill gear, 
spell research components, etc that players can donate to and draw upon 
if they are of suitable level to get the items themselves. Let the 
enchanters, necros mages etc trade pages and runes etc ...  

I'd also *consider* allowing certain quest drops to be looted and held 
for other members on a case by case basis... lambent stones are needed 
for each piece of the bard solro armour for example...i feel the quest 
was designed with the theory that the bard's guild would be keeping them 
for him... they drop rarely enough that it would be foolish to sell one 
to an npc merchant while a bard is actively seeking them.. I'd stipulate 
that the bard would have to be involved in at least one legitimate kill 
of a hill giant or griffon per stone that he takes. But I'd probably 
leave it to the honor system that he actually do it... players who cheat 
the philosophy are only cheating themselves. 

If they cheat themselves enough to impact the rest of guild enjoyment of 
the concept though then invite them to leave.

Its like taking an oath of poverty. If you take the oath and then look 
for ways to work the system to sneak cash to yourself you're missing the 
point. If you -want- to work the system and get rich then you weren't 
really interested in the whole oath of poverty thing, and had no 
business taking it. 

All that said I think the hardest thing this guild would have to learn 
to deal with is that the 45th level guy coming home from a trip to guk 
with a backpack full of fine steel is going to sell it. He is not going 
to offer it to the poor souls still wielding rusty and bronze. He can 
tell them where to find the IBC or whatever, but he wont give them 
his... even when he outgrows it. He's not being an ass though. The lower 
level players should actively not want it from him. If they've bought 
into the concept then they don't want his. They want to go and kill 
skeletons in Kurns and get their own. 

Ditto the minute a cleric his 40 and gets Temperance. He'll use it on 
his group mates, and maybe the odd time cast it on someone else in 
passing. But he won't offer it up, and lower level players won't ask for 
it. Ditto KEI, V, and so forth as the guild members reach those 
milestones. If your grouping with the guy he buffs you... if you not ... 
be prepared to do without... given the new elixirs, and tribute this 
isn't even that much of a sacrifice.

That's the whole reason they created these characters, after all, wasn't 
it? To discover the joy of doing things on your own gear under your own 
power, to gain the sense of accomplishment that comes by pulling 
yourself up by your own boot straps... 

If your just going to wear another guildies hand-me-downs, castoffs, and 
stuff that they crafted or found but have no use for while wandering 
around at 25th buffed to the hilt by the guild ubers ... what exactly 
was the point of this guild again?

I thought it was to avoid the screwed up EQ economy... not recreate it. 

;)
