flowing thought items regen mana at whatever level they are per tick
(ie, an FT1 item gives you 1 extra mana per tick).  these generally
drop in high-end dungeons, and have a required or recommended level
before the FT kicks in when they're droppable.

necros get self-only mana regen that's better than any enchanter's
buff (and doesn't stack with 'em), but at the cost of their HP.  what
you really need is something with some worn HP regen (fungi type
thing) or clicky heal.
