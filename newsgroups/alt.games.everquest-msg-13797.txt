Absolutely. You raised a valid point, and did so quite politely, which
I appreciate. I hope my reply was satisfactory?

As do I. I mean, I'm sure it's happened - with 300,000+ accounts, it's
almost certain to have at least a few times, but to hear her rabid,
um, rebuttals, you'd think this was a frequent occurrence.

But then, as I've said before, if it happened anywhere near as often
as she implies, we'd be hearing a lot of people screaming at Verant to
make the security more robust.

She hasn't. Though she did repost her own long-winded message on the
topic at least twice. Some kind of grab for attention, I suspect.
