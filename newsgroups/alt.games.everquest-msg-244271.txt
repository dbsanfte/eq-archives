After hunting around for an acceptable amount of people for a 20ish
group we ended up with War(me), Wiz(Newbie), Cle(Newbie), Pal(Newbie),
Mag, and another Cle. Well everything was going well until the leader
had to leave because of lightning storm. Okay down 1 experienced Cle. 

The other one was doing fine. A little while into the game the Mag and
Pal go linkdead at the same time. So I'm there with the two newbies
waiting to see if the Lds come back. 10 mins later nothing. We had the
time, 46 mins to do 16 more collections, so we decided to continue. I
had a temp (me is a temp wmp), so i tried to take the brunt of the
assault. One mob got by and I heard the tell tale sounds of a cle
being beaten on then a spell. The mob that got away didn't. Seems I
underestimated them. We worked our way up to the first named. Killed
one in the room and finished the adventure. I then asked if they
wanted to go after the named. I said it usually drop a magic item. The
answer was yes. I pulled the mob. I hit me with 'horrifying visions'
and sent me spinning while it and a lurker beat on the other two. Once
again I underestimated them as I thought they were goners. They
dropped the lurker and did some damage to the named. I unstunned and
proceeded to beat on it some more. It decided to d the same, more
horrifing visions. I came out of it and we dropped it quite quickly.
The loot was a lupin e belt of some sort with just saving throws. They
rolled and the Cle got it. I said it was time to go and they TL back
to BB and the KL started selling. Now being the War I had no TL so I
have to leg it back. On the way back I found the 'Dark Chest' we past
up. I then made sure of the way back to the entrance, came back and
inspected it. Looked like  a magic trap so I tried to open it. 200dmg
and it took my temp. 1 hit later I was limping toward the entrance
with 46% health and a destroyed chest behind.

I got back to camp, did the split and they asked if we could do it
again. Back to looking. 1/2 later I told them it was a no-go and I was
logging. Probally try it again next weekend. 

So if your on Bertoxx server and have a lvl 20-25 char keep an eye out
for an invite to a Ldon this weekend. :)
