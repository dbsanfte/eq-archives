Yeah, you guessed it, the jester.

OK, so he really sucks. But there's a way to get some benefit out of him 
if you want to go to the trouble.

Besides the illusions, and the bad jokes, and the size changes, he also 
summons you wine and bread, each of which are either poison or a mildly 
beneficial buff.

So the trick is to try what he summons, and take your chances. The 
poison, you throw out, the good stuff, you keep.

But the poison, while mild, is a 30 minute debuff sitting between you 
and your OOC regen timer; something that was when created a mild 
nuisance is now a big hit to your effectiveness unless you never take 
advantage of OOC regen.

Luckily, there are several ways around this.

1) Any class with cure poison can remove the debuff, its 6 counters. If 
you're one yourself, or grouped with one, you can chug/munch, and if you 
get poisoned

2) Drink/Eat in POK/GL/GH... you're protected from the bad effects, 
which don't land on you.

3) This is a tiny bit tricky, but send a cross server tell to a link of 
the item. This won't work, but the error message will tell you the item 
number. If it ends in 29 or 92, its poison.

4) Once you find good wine and bread, put them in your potion belt. 
Then, when you drop the jester's new summons into your inventory, if 
they pop up in your potion belt, they're good, if they don't, they are bad.

SO, all this effort and what do you get? Wine gives you a buff thats 
good for 30 minutes and supplies 3 mana and 3 end per tic. Bread gives 
you a similar buff thats good for 10 hp per tic regen. Each stacks with 
the other and with, as far as I can tell, all other buffs.

Sadly, these are great at low levels, but not terribly noticable at high 
levels. They don't scale with you. SO they're mostly good for an alt, 
but would you put an alt on your vet rewards?

Despite reports, it isn't true that the wine and bread vanish when the 
jester does. I had a stack of good wine for several hours... but it did 
vanish eventually, I think when I died.

More jester notes:

Cast takes a few seconds, you can't do it while running. If its 
interrupted, timer resets and you can cast again.

Conflicts with mount. Kills your horse dead and you can't summon another 
while he's up.

Vanishes when you cross a zone line (easier way to kill him than logging 
out and back in)

There is a rumor that he also occaisionally will CHeal or fully restore 
your mana bar.  I haven't noticed this but its rare I see him in a 
combat situation (or hell, any situation), and my current testing 
consisted only of casting him in the Guild Lobby once, and while running 
accross Marus Seru on the way to Ssraa once.

Still the worst vetreward ever, IMO
