I made sure he called himself one first :)

I don't know if it's 'standard' per se, but my provider (one of the
large cable companies) has crummy news service. As did my last
provider, come to think of it. Since news access is important to me, I
figure it's worth the money.

But yeah, it is kind of sad that the "all-in-one" providers don't seem
to do anything well.

I'm one of several to make that observation.

may turn on you.
