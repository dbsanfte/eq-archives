Two quick things.  A nice fellow bard gave me a weapon that also acts like a
brass instrument.  I like using the discord song with this but it seems to
be resisted easily.  Will CHA help in that department or do I need something
else(besides brass intrument skill) :)  Also I keep seeing this Symphonic
Saber for sale in bazaar with a effect of Symphonic Harmony but no body
knows what it does.  Can someone fill me in please.  Thank for you help my
fellow bards.  Now lvl 24 hehe
