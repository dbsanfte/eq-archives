On my server, you could do all of these combos for under 5k, and all of them
would be a significant upgrade to what you have right now. Very significant.
-Jarsath Trident (11/22 piercer, goes for ~3k on my server because it's not
very rare and it's warrior only) + Cane of the Tranquil (11/25 1hb, ~1k on my
server)
-Iksar Berserker Club (7/18 1hb...about 4k on my server but for some reason
it's hard to sell, so you could prob. find one for ~3.5k) + Cane of the
Tranquil
-Sword of Skyfire (2-3k here, its a 9/22 1hs) + CoT
-Kunzar Ku'juch (8/22 1hs, which procs engulfing darkness [which is a
dot/snare], about 1.5k here) + Whatever (since the Ku'juch is somewhat cheap
you should easily be able to afford any of the other listed items)

The "best" combo is Iksar Berserker Club + Jarsath Trident (the IBC actually
outdamages all the others in primary hand due to its low delay), but obviously
is out of your price range for the moment. It can serve you for a long time,
though. Trident + Skyfire would be another consideration. Mix and match,
according to how you want to look, what the prices on your server are, etc.
Hope I helped!
