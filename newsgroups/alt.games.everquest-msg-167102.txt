}I'm looking to buy some better items for my LV27 (soon to be 28) DE Necro.
}This is my HIGHEST LV character, & I'm not in a guild, so player economy or
}loot is the only way for me to gain coin.  I've got about 500pp left (NOT
}including near 100pp needed to buy my LV29 spells), leaving me about 400pp
}to spend (plus what I may earn from a few more items left to sell).
}
}Here is what I've got: (arms, shoulders, hands, legs, & feet, are all still
}cloth items)

I vote for kobold hide boots if you can get them.  Extended affliciton II 
could make a big difference for you.
