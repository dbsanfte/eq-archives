Because this is piss-poor testing on VI's part.  I understand making
everybody level 24.  That's fine.  But to leave everybody with their
level 5 spells or level 16 spells or level 12 melee skills and patchwork
armor will not end up testing anything but how quick a Pickclaw
lookout can chew through a level 10 warrior with level 24 hps and
paper armor.

Bump the levels (it IS test, after all), but fill in the spell books and
max everybody's skill.  Put some chain on the broke melee folks,
and give 'em a Langseax or a Dragoon Dirk.  Seeing a level 24
rogue killed by a green ghoul because he can't hit him with his steel
dagger while getting his patchwork stiches torn out is pitiful.

Hey, lets test the Tomb of Veeshan, too! Go ahead and bump 'em
to 55 with their level 9 melee skills and send 'em in...
