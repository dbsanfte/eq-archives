No. Dear god I wish it were.

You are describing a more complex scripting language than EQ supports.

What I do, as a druid (and a new chanter) is make a hotkey to say "%T has 
been ensnared!". Then, I cast using Alt-3(snare is ALWAYS in slot 3 for me) 
and if it sticks I let the group know with hotkey 3... So it goes Alt-3, 
then 3. Easy to remember that way.
