Sadly, the change to 65 experience came a bit late for our guild so I
can appreciate your problem with this. I was lucky enough to have a
group of friends in the guild who anticipated our long term goal of
doing this, so we were in SSrae several months before the rest of the
guild getting comm1 and comm2 parts. We didn't grind it out constantly,
just a day or two a week when others were out experience grinding. It's
boring for sure, helping to make Luclin one of the worst expansions ever
for progression but at least it didn't drive me to quit the guild or the
game over it.

I guess I'm lucky here as well, I have a good time grouping with my
guildmates even in the more boring camps, as most of them are mature and
like to joke around a lot, so even though we aren't getting experience,
it's fun. Experience grinding is just the same, other than the
experience part, if you aren't having fun grouping with guildmates,
you're probably in the wrong guild.

No, you misunderstood that part, shissar bane weapons are for the
Emporer, Vex Thal presents a different mob model ( a whole 3 different
models, heh ) of which you kill endless amounts for hours just to get to
the bosses for the phat loot. Again, while some complain about the
boredom, I find it still fun because it's definately not boring playing
a cleric on those runs, when you're pulling 4-8 hard hitting mobs at a
time.
