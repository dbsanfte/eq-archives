Right... you wish to no longer have your words taken to mean anything, I
see.  The way you phrase something is more than just style.  The words you
chose to express your ideas have meaning.  If we are to assume that "Price
gouging has never been an acceptable form of business practice" was not to
be taken to mean that price gouging has never been an acceptable form of
business practice, then what are we meant to assume?

"Ahh, the sky is nice and orange today."
"Actually, it's blue."
"Geeze, are you going to nitpick about how I phrased 'blue'?"
