At least in EQ1, backstab > all.     I haven't had the chance to do much group
playing on my rouge here, but I wouldn't expect it to be much different.   As
long as t he rogue / assassin can stay behind the mob, they can do huge
damage.

If you want big melee damage with some (barely any) tanking ability, scout is
your class.   Swashbuckler, Brigand and especially Assassin should all be very
high damage melee classes.  Ranger should be a very high damage mixed (range /
melee) class.

They should all be higher damage than even a bezerker, but the bezerker
probably can survive being hit on better, and doesn't require a tank to do his
damage, since it can be done from the front as well as the rear.

Or you mentioned casting classes.   All of the casters except the enchanter
type should be very high damage.   But if they get aggro, watch out... they'll
die fast.  Nobody really knows at this point whether casting will end up being
more damage than melee.  Both are possible.
