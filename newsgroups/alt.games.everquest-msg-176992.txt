My assumption was he wanted a rez so he was going to get a cleric.
Perhaps he would have been happy with the paladin ghetto rezzes. If he
was, then I was off on my assumptions. But all of my points were with
having a cleric AND a shaman in the group, and I made that clear.
That's why several of your points weren't valid to what I was saying,
even if they were for what he was.

Now that that is clear....

Evac is not a necessary ingredient except in certain places.

So? They still aren't necessary, and, as you see above given my
assumptions of what he already has, definately not a good trade.

He said he wasn't concerned about them so I didn't factor them in, as
per his choice.

I do not think sacrificing one of the two damage dealing spots in the
unit is worth it for gaining occasional faction help.

Yeah, but I did, and you were responding to ME, not him.

Like I said before any four person group is going to be viable. But
cleric, shaman, and druid is not going to be on the more efficient
side.

You are actually agreeing with me for the most part then. All my
points were under the assumption he wanted a cleric and a shaman.

Okay so best was a bad word. This doesn't invalidate what I was
saying. Four people together can always succeed. But not every four
person group is going to be as good as another, better balanced.

I assumed he meant the good rezzes. In the event that appears to have
been a good assumption since he took a cleric.

How many deaths has the age test group taken now? :-p

*shrug* I think rogue/sk is as good or better than any. It even offers
fearing as a tactic. Rogue sneak will negate the need for invis before
the shaman has it. But any two melees will work.
