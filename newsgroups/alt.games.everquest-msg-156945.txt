Grab a couple of opal-encrusted steins and keep them in
the bank for when you need to go shopping for peridots
(or for spells). +25 CHA each, generally cost 20-40
platinum a piece. They'll pay for themselves fairly quickly.

The CHA won't help much in the bazaar but is very useful
for supplies (and for selling stuff).
