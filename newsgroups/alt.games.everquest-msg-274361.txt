   Via the magic of Google, here is the last list that I had compiled.


 
 Oneiromancer............... March 15, 2005

 Graeme Faelban............. March 20, 2005
 
 Simond..................... April 13, 2005 
 
 James Grahame.............. May 22, 2005

 Kaev....................... June 5, 2005

 Sugarman................... July 1, 2005
 
 Rumbledor.................. August 19, 2005
 
 Pamela Carlton............. October 10, 2005

 Crash86.................... November 1, 2005
 
 Lance Berg................. November 8, 2005

 Celaeno.................... April 1, 2006

 Don Woods.................. April 30, 2006
 
 Annie Benson-Lennaman...... May 16, 2006
 
 Tyas....................... January 14, 2007
 
 Mary Poppins............... Never



      So it looks to me that our winner is... the person that took the
very earliest date!  Oneiromancer, who was off by a mere 35 days, if I
counted right.  Please note that I have turned on the applause sign, and
respond accordingly.  /em clap clap clap!   Oneiromancer, please watch
your mailbox for the delivery of the imaginary VW flower painted van
with the decent radio, as I will be shipping promptly and I'd imagine
that you'll have to sign for it or something.

   But you know what?  That wasn't as, I dunno, as satisfying at it
could be.  Truth be told, when I thought of this pool, I didn't even
think about the Zeks.  Oh, even if I had, I would have still picked far
too late a date.  But these have always been low population servers, and
frankly they probably could have been merged long before WoW and EQII
came along.

   So, in the spirit of "But I want a do over!", I'm going to keep the
pool open for the first merger of the normal rules servers, and Firiona
Vie.  That's right kids, I will send off _another_ imaginary VW Flower
painted van to the person who is closest to guessing the date of the
next server merger.  And this one has, oh, I dunno... how about a cool
black light poster of Led Zeppelin taped to roof, so that you can lay on
the shag rug and stare at it and just dig it all.  

    And I'll accept new entrants as well, and allow the old ones to
change their dates as well.  In the spirit of fairness I will keep my
old date.  And remember, by the rules of the contest everyone must have
a unique date.

   If there are any updates, I will post the updated list in a new
thread.
