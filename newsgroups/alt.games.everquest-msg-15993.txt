As an enchanter, I can walk unscathed through every city in Norrath
except Cabalis.  It just ticks me off that I can't.  Plus, I'm level
60.  Don't have to spend much time XPing these days.

I'm not spending a whole lot of time gathering bone chips.  When
hunting in Karnors or other high level places with skeletons, I ask
the master-looter to slide the bone chips my way if there's no necro
in the party.  Or I level a level one in Paineel.

Ok, I admit it.  This is the main reason I want to raise faction high
enough that I don't have to use the Iksar illusion.
