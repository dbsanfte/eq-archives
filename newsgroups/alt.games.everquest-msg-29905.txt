It'll never go up for your monk but it will feed her; my wood elf
warrior survives nicely on her racial skill of 50. In addition, since
you're an iksar, you get to forage special stuff. Eat roots first
(destroy them when you have food to spare), then fruit/berries, then
bunny meat. Vegetables are the lightest foraged food, but they're only
snacks.

And your ranger's skill won't start rising till she hits level 10, as
the racial cap is higher than her skill cap before then.
