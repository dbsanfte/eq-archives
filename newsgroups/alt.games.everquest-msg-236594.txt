Level 58 Bard here with a brief report on Natimbi...

I hunted in Natimbi for the first time over the weekend.  I chant and
charm kited some of those Cragwalkers near the zone-in by the LDoN
Magus across the river.  The XP in that zone reminds me of PoD XP
against the Tsetsian Flies.  I was getting 1% for every two kills in
Natimbi.  However, these mobs have no where near the amount of hit
points the Tsetsian Flies have.  I would say they have half the hit
points because they went down fast.  I have no idea how hard these
mobs hit because I rarely ever get hit when I solo.  I have heard
reports that some of these mobs quad for 1,000+.  Can anyone confirm
this?

I'm guessing that Natimbi will become the Druid and Wizard quad kiting
zone for Level 50+ characters.
