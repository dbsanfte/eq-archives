Yes, because I really thought you were posting from the future.

Taras, Taras, Taras, the problem is in YOUR HEADER. Your message was
dated as being sent at that time PACIFIC STANDARD TIME. This is not
something set locally. It's you.

See that little -0800?

It actually means something, Slick. Minus eight hours GMT. In other
words, Pacific Standard Time.

Was your message posted at 9:39 am Pacific Standard Time April 2nd
(about eleven hours from now)?

It wasn't? GASP!

Good to see you haven't changed, though. Still totally incapable of
admitting you're wrong. :-)

One should avoid intelligence insults when one is demonstrably and
utterly wrong. You probably feel very stupid now and will stop posting
again.

Irony, thy name is usenet. :-)

Good to have you back, Taras. Nice to have someone even dumber than
@ndrew to kick around.
