If you don't think that you will ever use a 1HS weapon, that you will never
get the epic, well then I would recommend the centi warhammer for starters.
That is the weapon that I used till I was up in my 30's or higher.  But I
would hope that you at least try to get uber.  I used to think the same
thing when I was a lower level, but now that I have found my family (guild)
it is a lot easier to get these so called uber items.  And getting is the
funnest part to it=)  going on high lvl raids is the most fun.  So give it a
thought.. IMO you should do what I did.. get all your weapon skills up..
cause there is also some very nice 2 handers out there that are great for
druids=)

here are the stats on the centi and it ranges in price from about 150pp to
300pp on the bristlebane server.. and might get lucky now that the bazaar is
up=)  http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7145
