Yeah, basic cable around here is about thirty bucks a month two. But
*two* EQ accounts, plus the monthly fee for a second ip address from my
provider brings it up to nearly that. Add in the cost of a second
computer, better graphics cards, more memory, bigger monitors, etc. (all
of which I decided we simply *had* to have for a better EQ experience
<sigh>) and it will take a lot of cable television to parse out as being
cheaper.
/em sighs sadly.
I should really seek help.
