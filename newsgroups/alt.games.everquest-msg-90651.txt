A good royal group will not just have one high chanter it will have 3 . You
dont single target mez (you cant too many people in the way ) . You use aoe
mez and that requires backup. Since chanters are required anyway you may as
well go full blown and use point blank aoe spells and stuns for almost all
pulls.

With that in mind a good group for the overking looks weird :) It can be
done with far less but with 24 it is absolutely trivial while with 12 still
a bit tricky.

3 chanters
5 clerics
4 wizards
2 druids
1 magician
2 monks
2 rogues
2 wariors
1 necro
1 shaman
1 bard
