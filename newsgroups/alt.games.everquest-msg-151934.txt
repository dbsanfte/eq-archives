Greater heal won't cut it, mid 50's.  (The original Ranger Spam Heal (tm))
Superior works good, as does HWOP.  (assuming the right conditions).  The
real winner though is Celestial Clensing.   Takes so little mana that with
any form of clarity, the paladin can re-apply it the second it wears off and
maintain the sameish mana level.    Heals what, 150 a tick or so?   Enough
to keep me alive in a lot of situations.

90 percent rez is 59, as I'm sure you knew ; )   And I still regularly make
fun of people who pass it up and waste valueable exp-gaining time to try for
a puny six percent.   (Must be the same ones that at level 24 were sitting
by thier corpse all 3 hours begging for a rez in Ill Omen.)

Yeah.  Vox and Naggy are a joke.   And staying at 52 to fight them is pretty
silly, IMO.   I'm not sure what kind of guild you are in, but Gore and
Talendor are definitely better options.   We had a very good run with them
for quite a while, and managed to finish all 4 active paladin mains.   That
was before they (Gore especially) became farmed by Team Manaburn though.
Probably a lot harder to get her alone and persuade her to give you a book
now.

Sucks about the Tunare thing.  Believe me I've heard that rant more than
once. ; )    Telkonadar, Narandil? the Wretched and Dain Frostreaver IV are
probably your best shots at a "better than epic" weapon.     Beginning
raiding guilds can take down Telk.  And, although harder to kill, Dain isn't
so tough, once you get the hang of him.   (Of special note since he is
spawnable, and drops his axe damn near every time.)
