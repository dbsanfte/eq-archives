I am a member of a community that, for a fee, passes out the software
and knowledge to do these things. One thing I will say is this...

I always used to be against those that used Macroquest and other
things of that ilk.... But with the way the game has become lately,
With subscribption down and not as many people playing, it almost has
become a tool for those that do not play as much as we would like,
like myself.

So, on the subject of Ghostkilling and Monk Nodelay / Turbomonk...
Once Sony decides to actually do some GM Service and look for these
people and ban them or / suspend them , they will find ways around it
again...and again...and again.... I have already seen it and I only
been a parto f this community that distributes these programs for only
a few months.

You may slow a hacker, but it seems you'll never completly stop them
unless EQ Programmers get off thier ass and seriously crack down, but
we all know they wont, because Everquest has been slowly dying since
Gates of Discord.

So, in essence, The Ghostkillers and Turbomonks are here to stay.
