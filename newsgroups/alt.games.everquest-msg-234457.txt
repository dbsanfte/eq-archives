It wasn't always like this... otherwise we wouldn't have such gems as:

alt.radio-shack.bill-bixby.dead
alt.radio-shack.bill-bixby.dead.dead
alt.radio-shack.bill-bixby.dead.dead.dead
alt.raffaella.carra.sucks
alt.raffaella.carra.sucks.sucks
alt.raffaella.carra.sucks.sucks.sucks

It should be a little easier to make ngs, and a lot easier to get rid
of them.
