Why not set the cost by bidding?  Everyone who wants it tells the person in
charge of loot distribution how much they bid, and he announces the high
bid, but not who made it.  Anyone who wants can up their bid, and new
bidders can jump in.  If the high goes up, the person in charge announces
the new high, and so on, until someone wins.

If you set the cost to "all the winner's points" like you suggest, someone
who has not looted something in a while, and has a high point total, will be
reluctant to loot an OK-but-not-spectacular item.  That doesn't seem right.

Also, if someone spends N points on an item, I don't think those points
should disappear.  Those points should instead be distributed to other
people.  Say, N/2 points get distributed among the people who bid and lost
on the item, in proportion to how many points they bid.  The remaining N/2
points get distributed to the rest of the people on the raid.

(This is loosely based on a system IBM developed to figure out whose turn it
is to drive in a carpool, where some people ride every day, some ride on
just particular days, and some only ride occasionally.  This is not as easy
a problem as it sounds, if you want to be fair.  Say you have a day where
only two people show up.  One has not driven in a long time, but he also
doesn't use the carpool much.  Another drove last week, but takes the
carpool a lot.  Figuring out whose fair turn it is in a situation like that
is tricky.  IBM's solution is clever and fair.  The basic idea is that
everyone has a certain number of rider points.  The driver for a given day
is whoever of the people that day who has the fewest rider points.  When you
drive, you earn 60 rider points, paid for by your passengers.  So, if you
were to end up driving one passenger, you get 60 points, he loses 60 points.
If you drive two pasengers, you get 60, they each lose 30, and so on.  This
system works very well).

It might also be reasonable to combine some of this with rolling when an
item is wanted by many people.  The 2nd and 3rd and 4th place bidders might
be given a chance to match the high bid, and if any do, they all, along with
the original high bidder, roll.

With any point system, one other thing you have to consider is how to handle
new members.  If you start them at 0, if the guild has been around a long
time, everyone might be so far ahead that the newbies will take a very long
time to be able to win anything.  That's probably not good.  Perhaps
reasonable is to list all the point totals for everyone in the guild, and
give the new people enough points to put them somewhere around the 40th
percentile.
