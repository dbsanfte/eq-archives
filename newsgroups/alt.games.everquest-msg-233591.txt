excellent advice, also...we are a plate class, with a decent AC we can 
take a thump or 2 in a pinch so you need to learn to trust your tank to 
get it off you. position is good, try to be close enough to heal but out 
of ae range whenever possible but sometimes you just cant and you have 
to suck up some damage. if your back is against a wall you may not get 
the knockback/interrupt as much *but* make sure it is not a place where 
you can get through the wall agro. when your raid or group leader tells 
you to stay *off* the wall, they usually know what they are talking 
about! and again, th elowest level root is you best friend on many 
occasions, fast and low mana. i keep it and the lowest stun memmed all 
the time.

i would also recommend staying away from paludal, i know it has a good 
zem, but you will not learn good grouping skills there imho. you might 
if possible find a lower level guild, group with them in one of hte old 
world zones where the mobs are more available..if you must do paludal, 
do shiknars and owlbears instead of phlargs and bandits.
