Hm, I wonder if my little Civ citizens were having religious fights over 
predestination vs. free will?

Civ 3 did a great job with cultural assimilation, but not so much with 
the cultural victory thing - I *always* won with culture even though the 
military situation was still up for grabs or, even if I was pretty sure 
I'd lose the fighting. I tried to find some kind of value I could set 
the victory to that would actually be indictive of cultural domination, 
but couldn't find a happy medium.
