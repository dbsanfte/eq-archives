We've been doing them by accident. We're a nonraiding guild but (by and large)
nobody has Vex Thal or better gear.

We had scheduled a casual raid in PoS to get BoT flag parts for some new
recruits and alts. At some point while clearing the Ocean giants someone pulled
the new SK epic 1.5 mob (for non-epic SKs). Someone in the raid, a guest from an
EP-enabled guild, claimed we didn't have the force necessary but we killed it
anyway without too much trouble.

This weekend our primary target was down so we went after Xanamech just for fun.
There were 30 of us, some of whom were lower-level alts. Someone pulled the new
Enchanter epic 1.5 mob which was a BIG surprise. AE blind, AE rampage, hits for
2K+. We killed it anyway. We had only one chanter in the raid, so she hit the
jackpot.

I'm willing to bet we'd wipe if we actually researched and planned these things.
