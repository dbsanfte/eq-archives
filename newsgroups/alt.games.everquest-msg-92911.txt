Because when 5 people reply to the thread and want to intersperse their 
comments with what has been said before, they have to move things around 
into the order they were posted or it makes no sense whatsoever.

Bottom posting has been netiquette standard since the dawn of usenet, top-
posting has only become fashionable with the advent of broken newsreaders 
like Outhouse Excess.
