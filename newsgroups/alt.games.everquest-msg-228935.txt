Spam has been extremely difficult to prosecute for years, requiring 
'special' (and again poorly written) legislation to try and tackle it. 
And even then they are allowed to send 1 message to you...

Yet a clearer case of someone else using my server, my hard disk space, 
and my resources to conduct their business I can't contemplate.

You are being naive if you think it is so cut and dried that trespass is 
occuring.

Further, a journalist or game reviewer who fires up Everquest and 
wanders around a bit is also 'conducting business' is he trespassing as 
well? Or what about a systems consultant paid to optimize the settings 
of everquest... surely he's going to evaluate the results by logging in. 
Is this trespassing too? The mere fact of interacting with EQs servers 
in the course of doing business is not sufficient to call trespass.

Preclude? No. You are quite right, it precludes nothing, but when the 
contract already stipulates the remedy for breach it is more difficult 
to seek additional damages, without extenuating circumstances. And in 
this case I contend that SOE has a weak case for damages in the first 
place against the average plat farmer... maybe against Yantis and his 
'organization'... but against 'joe nobody who exploited the plat bug' 
their isn't much there.

True, but ridiculous. "Lets prosecute the pawnbrokers not the theives."

Poorly written indeed. And fortunately, it only applies to americans. 
I'm still hoping that piece of garbage is repealed/amended.
