This is not true there are many vendor's that sell stat and longer lasting
foods.  Muffins and milkskins only last 15 minutes.  There is a vendor in
West Freeport over by the PoK tunnel by the name of Ping Fizzlecutter.  He
sells a drink called Fuzzlecutter Formula 5000 it lasts atleast 1.5 hours,
may be 2 Hours though.  I use these and Fish Roll's ( 1 bat wing and 1 Fresh
Fish in a spit) to force feed so I don't eat my stat foods.  I have a timer
that sounds ever 44 minutes totell me to force feed.  You can get your skill
ud to make them relably just trying to make them, but it isn't the cheapest
way.  the cheapest way id to get a skinning knofe from someone, and make
bear/cat/wolf filete's.. Everytime one of those creatures drops a meat,
rather then sell it try to make a filete, then sell it. once it says you can
no longere gain any skill, switch to fish rolls. Now you have a cheap(free
if you fish at all) sorce of food and enduring drink.
