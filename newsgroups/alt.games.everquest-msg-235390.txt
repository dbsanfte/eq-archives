For some reason, when I was using this method I needed to root the mob in
question prior to FD to wipe its hatelist of the FD character.  I think it's
because the monk/SK/necro doesn't go off the hatelist until the mob gets
back to its spawn point, and a root for some reason works the same way.

I never did try it in this manner at the spawn point of the mobs in question
to see if that would work without root.

Also, to the OP, don't snare or otherwise dot anything with the SK if you're
wanting to avoid outdamaging the druid.
