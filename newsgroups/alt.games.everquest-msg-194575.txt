i once died *in transit* to the nexus.  was gating to my bind point (i 
keep it there for simplicity's sake, unless i need a more strategic bind 
point) and when i get there, i notice i had lost a level and i couldn't 
see very well.  i then look down, and there is my corpse at my feet.  
tried /petition, never got a reply.  weird stuff indeed.
