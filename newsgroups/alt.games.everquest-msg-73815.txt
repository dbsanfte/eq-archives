As a puller you should be the one telling people what to kill first....(as a
general rule, some people may have had other experiences)

can still give a few licks that may change the battle.

This depends on what other classes you have in the group....if you have
another tank and he's high health, then yes you need to stop fighting(don't
run away) and let the other tank pull him off you...Now if you're the only
take tank in a group of casters, if you back off they might all get
killed....This is something you'll have to judge on a group by group
basis...At level 11, probably even the casters have almost as many HP as
you, and letting them take some hits to keep everyone in the group alive is
not a crime IMO(keeping in mind, they will have problems casting while
getting hit).....
