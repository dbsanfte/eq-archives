From time to time this pops up just before zoning into an LDON adventure:
"Soandso should zone in first to set the level of the dungeon."   In my
experience, normal produces mostly dark blue mobs, and high risk produces
reds and yellows.  However, I have had people argue that "they've tried it
with the same group, and entry order makes a lot of difference."

What is the official word on how this works or lacking official word, what
does a.g.e have to say?

Thanks,
Frank
