Well, let's see... so far I have.....

Phinny's staff.

/sigh

So not that close at all. Last time we tried real VS, we wiped even
though we had 18 people. (Wrong 18 classes, though we've done VS "Light"
with as little as ten, now.) 

We're only just starting to raid Fear now, and I've never even seen the
BG up, so no clue how that fight will go.

I should definitely have it by the time EQ2 has it's first or second
expansion released.
