Naw, I'm thinking back to before there actualy were Muslims...  Im pretty 
sure the concept of 0 and the Arabic numerals were Arabic inventions.  I 
think there were other examples of our famous ancient Greek philosophers 
borrowing from original Arabic sources.

It may be true, it may not.  I haven't seen anyone give any supporting 
evidence for such a statement yet.

Well, what I said was that our universities are eager to recruit Arabic 
students... They are just as eager to, in fact, as any other student.  At 
least in the graduate programs.
