Definitely you need the Coldain version of the weapon to get it to
proc below level 25. I found that out for I had a Velium Greatstaff
which kept saying my will was insufficient...

FYI, a Coldain Velium Greatstaff is a 10/36 (compared to 9/36) weapon
and I got mine in Thurgadin for more than 100 plat from the weapon
vendor. Be sure to pump up your CHA when/if you go to there to
purchase a Coldain weapon for with my nominal (no opal encrusted
steins) CHA (Halfling Druid) he wanted almost 150 plat.

Be sure to have very good DEX (better if  > 100) to get the staff to
proc more often.
