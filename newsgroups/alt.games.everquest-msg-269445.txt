Is that a 9700 Pro or XT card?  If so, and you still have to crank down the 
settings, then the problem is not likely to be your video card, in which 
case, there is little point in getting a new one now.

I run with an XP 3200+, 1GB of PC3200 Dual channel ram, and a 9800 Pro 
128MB card, and use the default settings with little trouble at all.
