Well, this weekend, bored of the usual raiding bullshit and
guild heckling me for refusing to go pro giant I ran my first
HoT raid. Lots of fun, lots of drops, but OH MY GOD, how much sitting
on your butt waiting for pops?

We took about 30 people, WAY overkill, expecting as I was something
more akin to our usual NToV pops and adds. Luckily, some folks had
to leave and after a while we settled into a nice routine, just us
and another guild in the zone occasionally helping each other out
when we got in trouble.

Anyhow, 3 hours in or so, a fair few folk have left owing to the extreme
scarcity of spawns, our shaman is AFK without telling anyone (duh),
our lead cleric has to leave and is ported out, taking one of the 60
druids with him, and the MA goes LD.

"Inc!"

Uh oh. NP. SA! Tank! 

fight fight ifgh tfight... ADD!!

Uh oh.... Fuck it... "IM TAKING AGGRO! HEALS ON ME!"

58 ranger happily tanked (and won! ;-) ) the elder racnar. Of course,
I flushed most of the raids mana into me, but hey, thats what having
funs about ;-) I think we had about 18 people left at that point so
we were still pretty top heavy.

Then, to cap it off, next day I log in to have a word with a friend
meaning to log off and get "Sui, we need your help." Hate raid of
a bunch of friends had gone bad (lower level allied guild), so we
tag along with a 60 SK, 60 Enc, me, 54 Rng and 57 CLR (xp group ;') )
and, 30 minutes in, Vagen, our NToV encrusted SK has to leave...

"Sui is MA!"

WOOP!

So, little ranger suid with a paltry 1130ac and 3750hp spent the
dregs of the weekend tanking Hate after a brief moment of glory in
HoT.

Who says rangers cant tank?

Suid (And what is it with the chain drops in HoT? Every other class
made out and we got TWO chain drops...)

P.S. Buying 200 peridots and 20 coffins as "prep" work stings when
its funded out of your pocket and not guild funds ;-)
