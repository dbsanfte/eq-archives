Why did they make it have to be done this way ? Why can't you just
load up the kit with the right items and just click on combine to make
an item ? Even with ctrl clicking it's still a lot of clicking and
moving that is unnecessary imo. 

You should just be able to load up your kit and then only have to
click combine with say an added delay so you can't just make 1000's of
items very quickly.
