I would love to see what runs through the programmers' minds when they
consider making a change to something that has worked beautifully since
EQ started and required no change. Dark blue cons now use a lighter
shade of blue text in the chat window than the default dark blue that is
also used for messages etc. It is now very hard to distinguish it from
the light blue con text...... Moronic change.

It almost looks like these people have spent way too much time together
to the detriment of fresh ideas. This can often happen in a programming
environment and requires the addition of completely fresh "blood" on a
regular basis to prevent these types of change for change sake kind of
implementations.

Surely there are other pressing matters that need attention other than
con rings, etc. Just how far can dumb go? I tremble at the thought after
this patch!
