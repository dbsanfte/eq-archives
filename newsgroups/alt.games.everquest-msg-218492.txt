No, he said he has complete and utter control over whether or not he 
passes on his genetics to a new generation.  That is quite different from 
what you are implying.  He is not saying he can control which specific 
genes he passes on.  He can control whether or not he passes his genes on 
to another generation at all, and he has chosen not to do so.
