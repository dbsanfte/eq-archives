On my server everyone is seemingly crammed into the upper levels of
the game, and the low end is moribund if not actually dead and
abandoned.  There are also too many "paper characters" who ram-raided
the Monster Mission XP while Sony "accidently" made the xp rewards way
too easy to get AND too plentiful.  Weird how once they had sold
sufficient expansions, they "fixed" that, huh?
