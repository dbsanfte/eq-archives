How can anyone be offended by the name "Wantsomedrinks"?

The mere knowledge that something like that goes on, is enough to offend
some people.

And so the resentment begins to grow and names like Iwanafuq start showing
up.

You mentioned the naming policy, which is in the EULA.  There was nothing
desperate about it, I'm sorry if it hurt you.

I never said my own personal view of you was a VaK, in fact, I kinda like

consider you a VaK.
