It was 7, got changed to 10, and likely, as happens far too often with 
SoE, accidentally got changed back to 7.  I am beginning to suspect that 
they have never heard of source code control systems, or just totally 
lack any clue whatsoever as to how to properly use one.  Mind you, that 
would just be one more thing that they appear to be completely clueless 
about.

Despite all that, I still play their games, as I still find them better 
than the alternatives.
