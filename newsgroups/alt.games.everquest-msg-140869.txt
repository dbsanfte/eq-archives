If you have an item up for what you know is a fair price, and somebody
else is selling one lower, theirs will eventually sell, and yours will
be the "going price" and it will sell also.

If five people are lower than you and seem to be able to restock the
item, then you're probably charging too much and will have a VERY long
wait.
