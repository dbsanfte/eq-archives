When parsing raid mobs (admittedly not too often), a ranger is always in the
top 3-4 of DPS, with the top spot being rogue, and 2-4 being different
combinations of rogue, monk and ranger.  Add to that the utility, nukes,
heals, buffs, root, snare, GOOD range damage (wtf can monks and rogues do
when a mob ae ramp is bigger than its hitbox), SNAP AGRO.. you outtank me,
and remember, tanking is about holding agro as well as withstanding the
blows, your dps with like for like weapons is close to mine, your range
damage far far far suppases mine, by a factor of 200, harmony, innate camo,
huge attack bonuses...  rangers are nowhere near the top for me, in terms of
damaged and broken classes. Not by a long shot.
