That's how Ogre and DE pallies do it (and my Ratonga Illusionist ;), but a
barbarian can start in Qeynos and not have to do the betrayal quest.  It's a
fun quest if you enjoy it for it's own sake, but if you're doing it just
because you have to, I can imagine it would be very annoying.  You need to
kill 500 gnolls, 5 group-required named mobs, and do a lot of running around.  

Take a look at the paladin abilities before deciding you want to be one for
non-RP reasons, too.  It does not have the healing power that an EQ1 pally
has, though it has some.
