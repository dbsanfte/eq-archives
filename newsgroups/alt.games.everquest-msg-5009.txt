Let me get this straight, "psycho God".

You admit you take a video game newsgroup seriously?  Does what I write
<really> provoke emotion?  Does it make your blood pressure rise knowing I'm
here and the only way you'll make me go away is to kill file me (which won't
matter because I'll still be here)?  Is it that, or is it the fact that your
life's been nothing but online discussions since the '70's?  Does it make
you mad that nothing you say or do will stop me from posting?  Are you
taking this video game and its newsgroup so seriously that you're willing to
dismiss everything you are/could be?  There is a life away from your
keyboard and monitor.  Step slowly away from the desk.  That's it.  It's OK,
it'll still be there when you get back.  Now, I want you to walk slowly,
taking "baby steps" toward the front door.  Now open it.  Step outside.  See
the sky?  Smell the air?  See the tree in the front yard?  The green grass?
The road?  The cars passing?  The neighbors waving "hi"?  That's real.
That's the world.  There's more than this newsgroup.

There's nothing wrong with me, since I'm actually able to easily reference
these things.

I hope it sinks in.
