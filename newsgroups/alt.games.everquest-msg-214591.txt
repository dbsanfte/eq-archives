Ack, another parallel with the POJ trials; DPS strategy over all.  I'd hoped a
variety of strategies would work, so half the classes in the game wouldn't turn
into "also ran"

What difficulty did you try, were these all 90 minute ones?  Posters from Beta
indicated that some were 60 minute limit, and seemed to suggest that normal
were 60 minute limit and hard were 90 minute limit, although I think someone
else contradicted that.
