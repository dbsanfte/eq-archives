    PoP pottery has trivials that aren't much higher than 250. The success
rate, even on the elemental stuff, is quite good. Every so often I see a
Stormwatcher's Stone in The Bazaar and convert it into a Ceramic Rod of
Storms for quick cash.

    That was a moronic policy. It just encourages people to find ways to
dodge detection, like grouping with bots or soloing.

    "The guild" is not some separate entity. It is a collection of people.
Each person in that guild can say that they contributed to getting the guild
into the elemental planes, and that the guild wouldn't be there without
them. Certainly if the clerics claimed "without us, the guild would be in
Crushbone" it would be true. As for fairness, all people in the guild that
have access have an equal chance of getting tradeskill drops and equipping
themselves. They just have to be willing to spend the time.

    Our system is this: raid drops go to the guild, to be made into items
for redistribution. Items in XP groups belong to those groups, to do with as
they see fit (including selling them in The Bazaar). Items handed out are
expected to be returned to the guild if a person leaves or upgrades. The
guild had a period of time where they would help fund skill-ups for folks,
but anyone who did that became a "tradeskill bitch". Anyone in guild could
ask them at any time to do a combine for them, and they had to do it free of
charge. Which suited me just fine, as I enjoy helping folks by tailoring
neat items.

    Oddly enough, on Sunday my raid evening was ended early when a group
wizard gated himself, myself, and a monk that actually needed the flag right
after we'd killed Rizlona. I hadn't had dinner yet and it was late, so I
just said "good night".

    I let the officers know if I see something suspicious like that. An
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure!

    Hmm. We usually start killing the mobs while someone kites them out a
passageway. Yeah, you can kite them out of the pit after RZ dies.

    You can petition people for that, by the way. Have the recruit /report
what the guy said to her, since I doubt she just invited anyone she saw
nearby.

    It's a nice item for a cleric. You can skip items like the elemental
boots now, if you like, because for 90%+ of your spells cast you have an
equivalent level of mana preservation. I just got my boots last night, and
I'm loving them. 10% preservation was not good enough!!

    It wouldn't be a flag raid without people zoning into the new zone and
getting themselves killed, would it? ;-)

    Seven ticks, 500 each, for roughly 300 mana with collar and SCM III.
3500 point heals for 300 mana are pretty tough to beat!

    It's called karma. She'll get hers in the end.

    Now this I have to read! I wonder if it can match my board's 58 page
Rallos Zek flamefest, or the dozen large threads on Sephrok the hacker.
