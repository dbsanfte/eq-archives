I've had a similar problem, tried the following:
Got Telco to change/swap all the lines/equip between my computer and
the exchange.
Checked with ISP and they said the disconnects were "normal" ie
initiated by my computer.
Formatted hard drive.
Got compter store to check my hardware.
Listened to line when LD was occurring and there was an unusual
squeaky tone going down the line.

Still go LD. Very frustrating. Once in a while I get a good connection
and can play for hours without going LD. Strange.
