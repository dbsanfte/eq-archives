I wouldn't get your hopes up. :-(
We ran into a case of a guy needing a rez who showed up with a surname
of ganjasmokah.  The cleric petitioned it.  Twice. In two days. Saw him
again last week. Same surname. I would have to concur that, for whatever
reason, the stated intent (as on the homepage) of strict enforcement has
gone the way of the dinosaur.
(Wait... that's a bad analogy. Isn't there a dino in OoT?)
