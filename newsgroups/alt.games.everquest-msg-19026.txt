MY GOD! You are so right...What have I been doing? What have we all been
doing?
Everyone on Bristlebane quit now, I'll be in EC, hand me your equipment and
I'll pass it out to newbies thus making the game pointless to them and
saving them the hardships they will go thru...I am willing to be the Martyr
here and stay a while on EQ just until the last lost sheep leave, I
willingly make this sacrifice. I will not rest until everyone is free (or I
have a full suit of cobalt)

:ï¿½)

Seriously, if EQ wrecked your life then well done for waliking away from it,
I'll stop playing when I stop enjoying it.
Most people leave this planet with nothing to show that they were here.
Enjoy life, if that means playing EQ (or it's ilk) or trying to grow
oversized root vegatables, as long as you're not hurting anyone, who cares?
