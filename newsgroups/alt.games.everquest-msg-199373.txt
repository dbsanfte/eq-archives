Oh and check that they arent correct either - if you measured the downtime
as how long it took you to log back in then you likely are wrong. The
login server gets heavily congested so you not being able to log in may
mean the server is up but you cant reach it - same result for you but
when they check their log they'll clearly be able to say you are
incorrect.
