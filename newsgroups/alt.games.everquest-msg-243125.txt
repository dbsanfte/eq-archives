	Do you have any idea of what it takes to run an actual I/ASP?
Obviously not.  There's a whole lot more than "store and display files".
Customer managment.  Host management.  Network management.  Monitoring.
Just the *billing* software for a large ISP takes an entire department to
write debug and maintain.  I might agree that a large game system is
"more complex" than an ordinary service provider, but how about say 
the software running a silicon FAB?  Including the R&D and simulation 
arrays. If you think tracking a couple of thousand mobs is hard try
25 million transistors.


	Here's some common sense.  Sony has opted for Newfeaturitis 
over network reliability.  They have many single points of failure -
each zone behaves as though it's a single machine - and add new features
without proper verification rather than fixing old problems.  Their
release strategy is very apparently executive rather than technology or
even market driven.  Conjecturing excuses invoking the purported complexity
of their systems is mere apology; there are dozens of examples of complex
systems that are *properly* architected and *properly* maintained to prove
that it is indeed possible to do so.

	Nor do I agree that these systems are that much more complex than
"the usual".  The mechanics of 3D gaming are well understood; if anything
Sony's problem is simply one of quantity rather than quality. If there *is*
such a problem:  since each zone appears to be a seperate machine I don't
see any reason to assume that any single zone is even an order of magnitude
more "complex" than any other 3D game system.

	And asserting that they dont charge enough to pay for service is
likewise rubbish.  Income from only subscription fees is on the order of
60 million per year.  Add in software purchase fees, console ports, 
merchandising, and whatever else.  It's certainly enough to have *two*
switches front ending a cluster, or sufficient multihoming so that when 
someone DDOS's your login servers you can still support your customers.

	Each zone is a seperate machine.  I'll bet there aren't more than
a few hundred objects on any single instance of the EQ server application.
