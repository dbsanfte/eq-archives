You loose the ones you are currently consuming. So if you if have just
eaten/drunk one you
lose it without getting much benefits.

My char auto consume food/drink if you select the drink then
thirsty/eat when hungry option. Even after dieing.

So, if run into some major problems you can consume a whole lot of
food/drink real quick with no major benefits.
