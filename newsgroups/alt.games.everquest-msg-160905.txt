No, my point is, that if you completely eliminate the phase in which the 
corpse is 'open', you completely eliminate the possibility of -anyone- who 
doesn't have PoP being able to loot the corpse ever.  Oops, sorry, I guess 
there's no point raiding with my guild anymore since I don't have pop, so I 
can't get exp, I can't get loot, even if it's a piece of fine steel or 3pp. 
I guess I'm just along for faction and to support my guild.  Joy.  I would 
have no problem with your idea if it was to modify it so raid loot rules 
applied longer, ie, if it's an NPC corpse that lasts half an hour, I can see 
making it raid rules loot only for say, 20 minutes.  And make the short 
lifespan corpses raid only for 5 minutes.  Sure, that'd be peachy, I hate 
ninja-looters too.  But it'd really suck if the piece of uber gear I'd been 
waiting for and raiding for forever finally dropped, and there's no point in 
me even bidding on it because I don't have pop on that account.

I think it would be nerfing a lot more people than just me.
