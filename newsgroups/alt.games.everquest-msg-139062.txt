I'm not an idiot, (contrary to popular belief) doing that would
jeopardize my job. I am correct on that.

All I posted in my original follow-up of the thread " The future of
EQ" was that EQ has a life of 2 years max before Sony/VI ( actually
more Sony) pulls the plugs due to cost , I even went as far a showing
a break down of "ALL" costs. Seems people forget about paying
employees and all the overhead that companies have. And also showed by
numbers that the increase of MMORPG begins to affect the total
population of EQ. Just read the post by TIM SMITH, he's basically say
the same thing I did, Up until now pretty much all MMORPG have been
the same so there really has not been any type of saturation of the
market. But come next year will be a flood of games "ALL" different in
ways from EQ. SWG, HUGE,HUGE fan base. Many  of which are eq players.
Will they stay in Norrath or go to Tattoine.Who knows. Not everybody
can afford 2 accounts or for that matter 2 computers. Also in the
running is "CIty of Heroes" which a few here want to play. Be a
Superhero, another Huge fan base. And of course EQ2 plus the other 10
or so games that will saturate the market.
And just like Mr. Smith said in his post, I don't see anyone that is
new to MMORPG picking up EQ over EQ2 once EQ2 comes out. As a consumer
you wouldn't be getting the bang for your buck out of the game or your
computer if you a new buyer.
Read next line slowly,
As of "this moment", there is no expansion planned after POP. We are
still currently working on POP to make sure it goes out without as
many bugs as possible. People posting that that's not true, yet they
give me a link to a quote which basically said the same thing that
there is no expansion planned after POP.
Once again "at this moment" there is no expansion planned after POP.
And, just like Mr. Smith said , there is the age factor. EQ is old.
If the game last 2 more years it would be a milestone in gaming,
lasting 5 to 6 years is a miracle in gaming, with new software and
hardware moving as fast as it is. 
Right now Online gaming is thinking in Broadband, people that don't
upgrade hardware or software get left behind, that's why it takes some
of you 2+hours to down load a patch. And then when someone asked how
did I know so much I made the mistake of say " I work for Sony and
know how they do business, first in the animation department and then
here".
And that's when the flaming began. 
Funny thing is I never claimed to be a programmer. The morons did.

It's cool V, I don't even really care, like I said I'm on SWG now with
a few other that got the green light. I work with cool people, that
have become friends,. Not like some shut-ins that hate people. No
wonder they don't want EQ to end, it would be the end of their so
called social lives.Funny thing is they claim to make big bucks yet
they are the same ones that say they can't afford a new computer.

Go Figure.
