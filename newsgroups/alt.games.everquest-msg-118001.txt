Ok, I'm level 18 Necro and can summon max level 16 pet that can smack for 20
points.  I have been trying a few different weapons in it's hands and it
seems to not make a whole Hell of a lot of difference, if any.  Am I wrong
here?  Someone put a short sword in it's hands when I was AFK for a bit
today and it never hit for 20 again even though it was before.  Is there any
benefit to putting a weapon in it's hands?  Was the fact that it didn't hit
for 20 again just bad rolls?
Also, I buff myself with Spirit Armor, then pet with SA.  When my icon
starts flashing I recast the buffs on us.  However, if things are slow I
tend to try to stay ahead of it by rebuffing before it expires.  This is
what happens... It refreshes for me, but not pet.  Pet's SA always expires
before mine runs out.  Not by a little bit either.  Can I not rebuff it
before SA runs out?

TIA,
Sean...
