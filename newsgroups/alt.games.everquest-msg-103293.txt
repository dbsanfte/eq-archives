Which, by the way, their site is down now.

Before it was taken down, Boody (an officer) posted this to the news page:


   Yes, OoR IS A GAY, FAG, GIMP GUILD!
   Posted by: Boody on Wednesday.April.3.2002 @ 8:47 AM PST

   Order of Redemption, has come to an end. Put 6ft under by the gay
   leader's Real life brother, Solkunar, and some of his real life
   friends. Was the leader there? We have yet to confirm so I will hold
   all of my comments till I know for sure. But let me tell you this, all
   of my RL friends, and myself, will no longer take part in this gay
   guild. Wakeing the sleeper is for fags. Just look at the people who
   woke him? Bye

   More news later.

   -Boody


Yes yes, all the talk about "gays" and "fags" doesn't reflect too well on 
him either, but that at least this gives some insight into what the other 
people/officers in the guild feel about the act that their own members, 
and possibly even their own leader, took.
