My thought was that they should not allow anyone under level 10 or 15 (my
friend who RP's as my brother suggests 20) to use the books; force players
at low levels to learn their own home areas first before venturin' out. On
Firiona Vie a couple weeks ago, there was a level 5 dwarf grouped with a
level 4 iksar in BBM. At least on the RP server, this would be a good
solution. :)

Bah, I hate that zone line...when I played my druid on the nameless, I would
always end up inadvertently zoning while root/rot/backup/root/rot-again hill
giants or griffins. Back then, I zoned a LONG time, and always faced the
possibility of going link-dead during a zone, so it was very frustrating and
annoying. :P

Where would we get our KEI if PoK no longer existed? :P

I like those ideas; the thing I hated most about the boats was the tedium, t
he fact you could explore the boat while travelling, but...there wasn't
really anything to explore. No spell casting, nothing to see, the
possibility of being knocked off the boat when it passed through a zone line
(see above about long zone times for me back then, lol).

Personally, though, I just see EQ as evolving. Everything evolves, not
everyone likes what the evolution becomes, but that's better than being
static and atrophying. Just my 2cp on that. :)
