The only allusion to masturbation in the Bible is Genesis 38:9, and the
debate is whether the Onan displeased God by masturbating or by disobeying
Judah's instruction.

There is nothing in the Old or New Testament relating to birth control.  The
restriction there is by interpretation, not strict reading of the scripture.
Once people begin interpreting any document, even the Constitution, there
are always grounds for debate.
