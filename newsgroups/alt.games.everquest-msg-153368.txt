    When we did AoW we had an eight cleric CH rotation with 2 second
interval, and two clerics on cover CH (watch each interval, if ever someone
is late by one second cast CH). We were the first to do him on our server,
though, so our gear level was greatly reduced from what folks would have
today. In particular, we had almost no AA's at the time. Today, I think you
could easily substitute druids for the cover clerics. Bet you could also
fiddle with the CH chain, but that one is very robust and should keep one
tank alive all fight barring back-to-back flurries or other oddities. If you
keep one tank alive all fight, you don't need to fuss about with switching -
which is a major hassle here.
