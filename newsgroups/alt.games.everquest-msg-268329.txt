That is what has always been said before....

As to the future who knows...
There is an aweful lot of room for mmorgs to grow. where millions were
online for games like diablo only hundreds of thousands were subscribed to
games like everquest.
I think the more good games that come out there is more growth potential for
the better games.
DaoC lives on. I no longer play that game but i dont think it is at
subsistance levels.
