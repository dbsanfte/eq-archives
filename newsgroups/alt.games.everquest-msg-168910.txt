Of course Instill Doubt works, else why would they put it in the game?  It
works about 1-40 times, so all  you have to do is camp near a zoneline,
Instill Doubt on a wandering MOB, if it works, BS it to death (as in Back
Stab NOT the other kind of BS-although in some cases that works better than
Instill Doubt).  If it doesn't work, run to the zone, then zone back in and
try again.  At this rate you should be able to kill something at least one
in forty attempts and killing something by yourself is THE definition of
soloing after all, PROVING that rogues can solo.  OMG! some people are
soooooo dense, of course rogues can solo.

I myself solo'd a rogue from 1-60 in this way.  I started at around the time
of the Spanish Inquisition (was my punishment for being a witch) and
finished late last night after reading the FABULOUS rogue soloing tips
outlined in this thread.  So put that in your pipe and smoke it you
nannie-baby rogues can't solo weenies!!!!! *sticks out tongue*
