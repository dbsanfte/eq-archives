It actually works, it's just a client side update issue (like the bard
stamina song only in reverse).  If you've got jboots or some other
clicky(or cast a spell), click on them and it will update your mana
bar.  So it just appears to be not working, when it is until you get an
update from the server.

I had a lapse of sanity probably due to patch day and forgot this
momentarily - long enough to post here and say "Doh!"
