Greetings.

Currently have the title Venerable, and was wondering how many aa's (and in 
what area)
I would get the title 'Elder', and then the title 'Ancient'.

I was told 18 aa's in class should get me Elder, but I've well and truly 
passed 18 aa's and not
got the option yet.

Anyone shed any light?
