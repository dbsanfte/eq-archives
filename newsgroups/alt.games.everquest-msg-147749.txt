Hey now, I soloed happily from 44 to 60, getting at least
half my exp from soloing each level!  Cleric nukes are
decent ratio, root and nuke will kill blue cons reliably,
the only non cleric thing you need is a running speed enhancer...
don't Need it but it really helps tremendously.

I also used to solo at lower levels, but didn't get so fanatical
about it.  Do remember fondly the Specters, who happen
to run slower than a non speed enhanced cleric, and of
course are much easier to kill than non-undead mobs.... but
most of my solo career was spent on live stuff, curse Verant
for including so little undead in their little game.
