It's time to move on.  For about $60 if you shop around, or about
$80-$100 if you go to Best Buy or Circuit City or someplace similar,
you can get a GeForce 2 MX 200 or GeForce 2 MX 400.  Either of these
will completely blow away your current card (you'll be able to go to
Warslik's Woods with your clipping plane all the way out!) and will
work well with DirectX 8, and with the new non-EQ games.
