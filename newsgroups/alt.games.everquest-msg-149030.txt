You can run PC1600 and PC2100 in a 333 board, but they won't be
running at 333 (unless you overclock the memory through the Front Side
Bus). For that you would need PC2700, and a processor that can handle
333 (you may have to "unlock" the processor to lower the multiplier in
order to raise the FSB to 333)
