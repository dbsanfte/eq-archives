Zoning and gating is a crutch, as well.  I doubt many of us would to too
well without those crutches, though.  By the fact that Verant put guards in
newbie areas, I would assume that they think that 13 -isn't- to high of a
level to use the guards.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
