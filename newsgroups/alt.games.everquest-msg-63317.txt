EQ's coming down in about an hour until some time tomorrow morning.  Spend
that time looking at www.everquestlive.com to see what they recommend

I wouldn't recommend doing anything at all to your EQ files until EQ is back
online (the problems may fix themselves) but it doesn't hurt to have the
information handy.
