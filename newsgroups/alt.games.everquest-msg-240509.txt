Well congrats and welcome to EQ! Reading the whole thread, I'll
respond to several questions here instead of after each thread.

I think you have a little confusion to the /loc command. This tells
your current location in the zone and not the corpse location. One
good tactic is if you know you are doomed and are all alone, take a
/loc just before you die and jot it down on a piece of paper so when
you get back to the zone, you know where your body will be near.
Learning how to find locations is pretty crucial for many instances -
so its wise to set up a /loc hotkey as well. Some people have problems
finding locations, and its really not hard. What I do is spam myself
with the /loc hotkey and begin to move. Ill rotate myself about until
the numbers start heading in the direction of the location I need to
get to.

However, if you are still under level 10, you dont need to worry about
your body, as you will reappear at your bind point with all of your
equipment.

Also, if you think you are near your body, set up a hotkey with the
/corpse command, this will summon your body to where you are at if you
are very close to it. This will help in case your body fell just under
a hill and you cant quite see it (also good for dragging your body or
anothers with consent to a safer place).

You asked earlier about what to tip necros or someone finding your
body. Necros, Bards and Shadow Knights can cast a spell (or sing a
song for bards) that can point them in the direction of your body if
they are grouped with you. Theres no associated cost with this, but a
little tip of whatever you can afford is considered polite. Be careful
with the bone chipped rods. These are great tools but use them
sparingly. They only have 3 charges I believe and each time you click
to use it, it will use up a charge. If you run out of charges before
you find your body, you've wasted a rod and are back to square one.

Summoning your body is another matter. Necromancers and Shadow Knights
can summon your body with a rather steep cost. Im not sure of the cost
of the coffins for the lesser summon corspe, but the higher level
coffins can cost up to 150 plat (maybe a little bit more).
