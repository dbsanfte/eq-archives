I have seen tow different caps for specialization the one in the Prima book
says 200 and Casters Realm has 250.  Which is correct.

My specialization is Evocation and a friend told me at some skill level you
start to have the possibility of a "double-tap" - double damage.  Is this
true?  If yes, at what skill level?  I am at 191 now and have never seen it.
