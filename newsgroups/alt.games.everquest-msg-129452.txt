You only copied one of the two definitions there.

"a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown
and prob. unknowable"

is the other definition.  Not that that changes the fact that what DT said

Using the second definition (actually first in the dictionary), it is
possible to be an Agnostic Atheist.
