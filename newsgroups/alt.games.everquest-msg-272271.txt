Amazingly, I _was_ surprised.  I thought, "new, different game, they'll
do better this time."  Low and behold, they screwed the pooch moreso 
than in EQL.  EQ2, for the soloer = painful grindfest to get anywhere.

To answer the xp/con question between the two games, an orange con in
EQ2 (one level below "wipe the floor with you") is approximately equal
to light blue cons in EQL.  I was not exaggerating that, at level 20, it
will take about 500 orange cons (solo) to level.

Group con'ed greens (the ^^ variety) were a viable way to grab some xp
at about 1 - 1.5% xp per solo kill (they were by no means easy fights), but 
since they upped their damage output, a soloer is stuck with running 4
or 5 quests over and over, or killing _hard_ orange con mobs for like
25% xp each.

For time invested, in my opinion, you should get ~ the same amount of xp
in a session, regardless of which way you play.  As it stands now, you get 
about 6 or 7 times the xp when grouped for any given amount of time than
you do solo.

Therefore, no more $15/month from me.  A drop in the bucket, but they all
add up.  Maybe I'm just at a point in my life where I want my "fun" to be
FUN, and not "kill the same goddamn-mother-fucking-orange-snake" again, 
and again, and again, and again, ad infinitum....
