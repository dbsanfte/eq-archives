Yup (well, at least under the old resist system...has the new one been
worked out yet?).  For example, a friend was telling me how when they tried
Trak when he was in the low 50's, with resist gear and buffs putting him
will over 300, he got owned.  Later, doing Trak in the high 50's, with
resists in the very low 100's, no problem.

I suppose that's both a good thing and a bad thing.  It's bad because it
basically means that for many encounters, people in the low 50's need to
stay away, even if they otherwise could have been useful.  On the other
hand, it is good because it means you don't have to get your resistances
insanely high, which can be a pain if you don't want to give up all your
other important stats, especially if you are not a hardcore player.
