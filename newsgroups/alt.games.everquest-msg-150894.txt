Bah.  D00d-speak has always annoyed me.  I mean, it's fine for talking
amongst friends and stuff, but if you want something from, ask fully and
politely.  I *like* buffing.  "If it's not too much bother, may I have some
of your cleric buffs, please?" will *always* get a yes from me.   =)

Very unlikely; ebayers buy 50+ characters, not 10th level characters.  More
likely it was someone who was just more inexperienced than you were.
Probably someone higher-up that was power-leveling them, but was trying to
get XP without that upper-level person and was expecting that any random
stranger would continue the power-leveling for them.

D'oh!  I *never* accept un-asked for group invites, and you shouldn't
either.  Personally, I think it's rude to invite someone without first
asking them if they're looking for a group.  You shouldn't feel guilty for
declining out of hand.

> and healing the kobolds as I kill them.

FYI, players cannot heal mobs, so she couldn't possibly be healing them.

This is a *good* thing, as many's the time I've accidentally had a mob
targeted as I cast Complete Heal.  Imagine if that actually *worked*.  "Oh
look, that Tae Ew Spiritcaller just went from 10 percent health to full
health.  Oh well, let's get ready for the corpse run."

That is correct.  If you're in a group, anyone in the group can loot corpses
killed by anyone else in the group.  This is usually a good thing, as the
tanks can concentrate on killing things while a caster can loot the corpse
to clear them out of the way.  Then when the group decides to bring thens to
an end, loot can be divided at that time.

In the old days, you didn't get those "Soandso has looted Uber Weapon_01"
messages, so you had to completely trust your master looter.  With those
messages, everyone is being kept a little more honest.

Normally you can tell the difference between death and zoned.  If your
groupmate's dead, the health bar will be completely empty.  If they've
zoned, their health bar will be full, but very dim.

An interesting experience.  Clearly she's becoming too dependent on outside
help to advance her character.  I believe you're doing it the right way: on
your own, figuring things out as you go along.  That's how I built my
60th-level Cleric.  I was never "twinked" and never had as much as 200 plat
to my name until I was level 20 - which I promptly blew on banded armor and
a Screaming Mace.  I think the journey is much more satisfying if you do it
on your own (not that you should refuse help, but you shouldn't *depend* on
getting help).  And it makes you a better player as well.
