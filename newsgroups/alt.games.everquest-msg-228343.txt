This is a pet peeve of mine. So few players seem to know how to react to
this situation. When we don't have a chanter around I'm the resident ghetto
mezzer and I've even got a macro that spits out "I've ROOT parked %t, please
move/stay away from it". What usually happens is the smart guys will get it
and back off, some combination of players/pets will keep attacking, the
smart guys will then feel compelled to move back in, meanwhile the pets are
pulled back, etc, and everyone is so confused at that point that they wind
up just all going back in and taking damage from both mobs.

I then give my little ghetto mez lecture and and on the next encounter it
results in a different variation on the scenario above. I think this is just
one of those things that guildies and groups of friends probably get better
when people are familiar with each other's play style. But pick up groups,
whew.
