Obviously the solution is to bring multiple Paladins with Soulfire
(5 charges of instacast CHeal) for any really big mobs.  Then you
can stretch your CHeal chain to increase efficiency as all those
instant CHeals can be used to cover flurries and glitches in the
chain.  As a side benefit, when your MA does go down you'll have all
these heavily armored Paladins in melee range of the mob who've been
gaining substantial agro from LHing and CHealing in addition to
taking whacks at the mob, so the mob'll be less likely to decide on
a Ranger/Rogue/Monk/Caster snack while your working at getting agro
onto the next Warrior.  /mourn Sir Lucan
