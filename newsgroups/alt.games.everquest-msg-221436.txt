This is my prefered method of payback in groups. I 2-box a mage with my
cleric so try to get the mage as ML'er makes things easier. I do ask
everyone if they spent anything (other than me for my cats eys or malachite)
for the betterment of the group, I have paid for peoples KEI etc. out of the
split at end. Usually no one cares, though I did get a warrior that said
"You should reimburse me for some of my equipment cost, since it helped you
with adventure" of course he is on ignore and never group with lists........
