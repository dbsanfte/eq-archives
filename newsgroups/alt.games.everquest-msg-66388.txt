Personally, I hate farming greens with a passion. Might be less
annoying when I get a pet, but still...

I have tons and tons of plain silk swatches from my time in
dreadlands, and I let my alts do the cat pelt/ plain silk thing for me
while they hunt for exp. 

Besides, I might get those last two possible quiver points from the
half dozen pelts. Hope springs eternal, you know. As for quivers being
cheaper, I was at skill 80 when I burned 17 HQ pelts for one single
raise, just to clear out my bank (the following week, pelts were
stackable). I did the next point on one cured attempt and then did
some work on low-end crystalline silk. I never had that bad a skillup
streak again.
