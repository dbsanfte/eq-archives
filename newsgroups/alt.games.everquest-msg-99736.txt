I spent seven levels in LoIO, and didn't see a druid ring.  Sure would have
been useful to have one there, too.  Buy a clue.

The druid ring that isn't there?  And there's no reason to meet at the
hypothetical druid ring, since you don't need to be at one to port.  If he
can't tell if the person he's paying is able to do exactly what was
requested (as opposed to a widely accepted substitute), then this is a cheap
lesson.  Hmm, maybe my paladin should start offering ports... she gets asked
for SoW often enough.

And how often is it that a druid wears a robe, vice leather?  Uh-huh.  Seems
like a very good generalization to me.  Now, how often do you see wizards
wearing leather?  Although the orignal poster didn't say, I think it's a
fairly safe assumption that the person that ported him was wearing leather.
Should be a tip-off.
