Great thanks for your help and some much need answers.  We were in WK the
other day doing the scarecrow thing, this was a great thing until the healer
my Cleric wife went link dead (hehehe boy did that suck) anyway.
My next question to any Lord and Lady willing to answer is where is the next
closest range guild from Surefall Glade?  The Karana plains are no the best
place to be lost and travel alone just wondering if a port would be much
easier to another area.
Thanks again for your very helpful assistance.
