My uncle is a chain-letter sender and a "joke of the
day that's been passed around 5 kabillion times"
sender and also a virus-by-accident-while-warning-
you-not-to-open-soandso-virus-email sender.

I don't want to get his email account banned...he's
my uncle! So I went to his house and deleted
my email address from his addressbook without
telling him.

Chances are, if he asked me if I got that joke the
other day, I'd seen it 40 times before anyways...
