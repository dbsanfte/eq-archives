I KNOW thats the reason.

That was a mistake, they have recognized it, and the A3 will have full
auto as an option again.  

Further, 3 round burst is auto enough for most purposes, with the small
size of the round 5.56mm(.223 cal)  its required.

With a 22 lever action firing .22 long rifle, Assuming no jamming, and
20 round capacity,  I can fire 20 rounds in 16 seconds.  Those are aimed
shots.  So 12 people with those 20 rounds would be trivial.

Auto fire.
