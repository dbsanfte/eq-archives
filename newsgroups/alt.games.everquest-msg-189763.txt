Option 3: find a group fighting blue-to-you cons and just taunt their mobs 
without attacking.  IF the tank in their group has been working on taunt, 
their higher taunt combined with the fact that they're actually doing 
damage to the target should add up to you not actually grabbing aggro, but 
having your taunt skill increase anyway.

You also might try taunting corpses.  No idea if that works though.
