A good way to get skillups is to find a shammy buddy that is above 60 
with a compliant pet that is red to you. /duel and thwack on the pet 
until you are bored silly. The shammy buddy pops you heals, haste and 
the like as appropriate as you take on his pet. Did this with a baby 
berzerker alt to top off all my weapons skills. Was the most boring 4 or 
5 hours with only a friends companionship and chatting to make it 
tolerable. Maxed out 2HB, 2HP and 2HS nicely, also maxed out offense, 
defense, and other assorted skills, but only got kick and frenzy to 50.
