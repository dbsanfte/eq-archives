The freeport boat doesn't go to LOIO, it crosses the
Ocean of Tears to Butcherblock, and you can then
wait for the shuttles to Timorous Deep, where you
can catch a boat to Firiona Vie, then run thru that
zone past some spider type mobs that cast root...

Or you can go to oasis, take that raft to Timorous
Deep, and then catch a boat to Overthere, run thru
that zone, and the Frontier Mountains.. well, I
know it -sounds- quicker but I left out the repeated
trips back to loot your corpse.

Here's another alternative:  Oasis raft to TD, swim
to elven outpost, board shuttle to FV boat and
go catch that.  Don't get off when it stops for the
BB shuttle, stay on and you'll go to FV.

But here's the fastest way there: buy an invis potion
in West Freeport (10 pp or so), take Oasis raft to
TD, swim to the firepots, take the Cabalis pot.  Drink
the potion and zone out to LOIO, run past the guards
and you are home free; this puts you into the newbie
area of the zone, keep heading out clockwise till you
reach stuff your level (probably near the mill)

This isn't ideal for you, but if you have a buddy who
can cast invis and bind, the two of you can bind
in Cabalis and walk in and out with near total
impunity... if you end up dead and your buddy
doesn't, he can just gate to you.
