I could ask you the same question. By the way, do you go around holding
steaks in front of lions at the zoo and wonder why they bite your arm
off? Since you've been lurking for a while, I can't imagine that you
really expect to see a "Gee, you know you're right. I really have been a
prick lately." response from him. You have now been placed among the
ranks of all the other trolls in this newsgroup. Congratulations on a
job well done.
