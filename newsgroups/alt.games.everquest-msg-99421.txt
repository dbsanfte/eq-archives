Well they are wrong unfortunately. Testing has shown no
mana saving with the neck piece.

However, The earring has been shown to be the mana reducer
as tests have shown. The earring was originally thought to possibly
reduce aggro but how the hell can you test anything like that.
Someone posted on the mage compendium that they tested
the earring and got 45 spell casts with it and 41 without it. Pretty
clear it saves 10%. That was with a DD spell, Depending on how
many spells it works with this is a damn nice item.

No I don't think it was a bug. I think they just didn't think it through
all the way and didn't realize that it effected ALL component spells
even the enchant spells. Saving a peridot here or there is no big
deal but duplicating Platinum and Velium bars was a huge screw up.
There are several people at Verant going Doh! Doh! Doh! right now.
