I had a friend with a druid kinda stalled at the same level.  I suggested
the Mushroom Temple area in Dawnshroud.  He started soloing there and was
39th level about a week later.  There are also a lot of groups at your level
there, so if you solo'd in that area you could easily be available for group
openings, but stay busy while you wait.
