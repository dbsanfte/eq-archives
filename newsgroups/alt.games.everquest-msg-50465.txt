If I recall correctly DAOC recently announced an upcoming Euro server as
well.

Assuming - just for shits & giggles - that your conspiracy theory is correct
that one game is setting up a Euro server because the other game is, why are
you assuming that it was DAOC's idea or implementation first?  Which company
do you work for that you'd have such impressive inside information.

In other words, shut the fuck up, no one cares about your paranoia.
