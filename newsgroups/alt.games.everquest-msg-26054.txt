What you have to realize is that a sizeable percentage (perhaps even
the majority) of these people are NOT newbies.  They are scumbags who
have realized that they can make a fair amount of money by creating a
level 1 character and standing around looking pathetic.

How do I know this?  Because so many of them have a knowledge of the
game (and in particular the value of items) which no newbie could ever
possibly possess.  Or you'll see the same shout over and over (replete
with the same misspellings usually)....how many newbies do you know
who know how to make a social key or even the use of shift-up-arrow?

Newbies, in my experience, are usually too shy to jump right into a
game and begin BEGGING for stuff from everyone they meet.

As you point out, giving *unsolicited* buffs, items, plat to low
levels you see around is one thing.  Responding to beggars, however,
is quite another, and in my opinion anyone who does so is being played
for a sucker.
