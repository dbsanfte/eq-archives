ROFLMAO

Just take any dye like red dye, dump a lot into the cranberry 
sauce, and when they snarf it down, they will dye their mouth 
incredibly red=) .... like red velvet cake red =)  Just have to 
do it in steps - peel the wrap carefully after the dinner thaws, 
dump and mix dye in thawed liquid cranberry portion, gently 
reseal it again with a touch of some innocuous glue [hot glue 
gun=)] then refreeze.

If no cranberry substance, then slap a layer of black paste dye 
on the underside of the top piece of meat=) then refreeze and 
take merrily to work=)
