Sounds like someting changed the refreshrate you PC is using at 800x600. The
two fixes I can think of off the bat are:

1) Manually resize the screen while in game using your monitors built in
controls.

2) If you are running Win9x of any flavor, while at the desktop, go to
800x600 mode (in the color depth that you play EQ at - 16bit by default,
less you've changed it), and use the display adapters property settings to
bump the refreshrate to something that centers the picture more correctly on
your screen. Refreshrates are stored by colordepth/resolution combination,
and so you must be in the correct colordepth to fix the refreshrate while in
game.
