    DI is OK, since it goes off much more than Death Pact and it heals the
buffed person for a good amount. We use it in the exact same circumstance
that Ben did. Death Pact is back-of-the-book poo. I once buffed an entire
Vox raid with it. Result? The only time I saw the spell go off was on the
Ice Giants that the Ice Giant Priest had buffed with it. And yes, we wiped.
