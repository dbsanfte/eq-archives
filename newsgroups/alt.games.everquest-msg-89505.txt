Not all of us are that godlike. 
I'd like 6500hps (I'm close) and when I get that, 7khps will be my new
goal. There's mobs I want to be part of killing. There is no 'end' or
closing credits in EQ, so without goals, I can't see why I would 'play'
other than to sit at my bind point chatting all day

I assume High Priest, Cursed and Emperor in Ssara are dead to your hand
then? Lord Seru too. The Burrower, new Vulak sequence...

The end game is not a case of 'find enough people'. Not everything in EQ
is zergable, since numbers reach a point where lag becomes more
detrimental than the extra people bring to the encounter.
