My guildmate was just forced to change his name by a GM. Not that I have
anything against the naming policy, but this is the same server on which  I
see Imma Doofus runnng around.

His name was Catinnahat.

I realize there is a copyright issue (kind of - not like it was Catin
Thehat). But I see MUCH worse out there. He's a nice guy and a Dr. Seuss
fan.

Oh well - give a wave to Nahat on Erollisi Marr if you see him.

Drywit <<<=== Top posting till he dies : P
