Plenty.

Some are better and easier or harder to work with. In my experience, a
bigger case is better when it comes to having room to work inside the thing.
Shop arouns and find one that suits you.

Nothing wrong with AMD chips at all, I actually prefer them over Intel. The
fire issue is more due to shoddy motherboards. 2GHz is fine if you can
afford it; you won't have to upgrade for many years.

I'm partial to ASUS boards, myself. Get one that supports DDR RAM and
ATA-100/133 drives

DDR.

Forget the GF4 and go with a GF3 Ti200 64MB. DDR preferably.

The more space the better. ATA-100 or 133 is best. Whichever you find more
affordable.

Suit yourself. Higher speed is better of course.

I'm a SB Live!-er myself, but Turtle Beach makes a good card too.

> Display: Either existing 19", maybe a new 21", or a 17" LCD?

I'd bypass the LCD personally when it comes to gaming. And don't ever pay
retail for a monitor right off the bat. Ask what they have in opened stock
first...you might get a very pleasant suprise. Nothing wrong with the
merchandise, still carries full warranty usually as if it were new and
sealed. The only difference is that it has been purchased and returned for
whatever reason.


> Others: Standard floppy, optical mouse, keyboard, 100Meg ethernet,

Forget the floppy drive and go with a CD burner.

Suit yourself with keyboard and mouse. I prefer standard keyboard and
optical mouse. Logitech makes some decent optical mice that in my opinion
are better and far less expensive than the crapola that Microsoft, et. al.
put out.

Most broadband connections available residentially run on 10BaseT ethernet
standard. Go with a 10mbps net card unless for some reason you need 100mbps
capability on your LAN. Even then, make sure you go with cards that can
autosense both 10BaseT and 100BaseT.

No sense in buying one retail if you can build it yourself(it is painfully
easy most of the time) or have someone who can do it for you. If you shop
around when it comes to parts, you'll also come out on top pricewise.
Additionally, when it comes to upgrading and working inside the machine, you
don't end up running into trouble because of proprietary motherboards and BS
like that which you get from Compaq, Gateway etc.
