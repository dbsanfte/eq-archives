Ok, Quick question!  I just turned 39 and got my TL's. I was under the
impression that I needed a small portal fragment for each cast of a TL.  I
bought one and gave it a test and I still had the fragment.  So my question
is do I or do I not need a fragment for any type of TL. If no then what are
the small portal fragments that little gnome dude in the temple sells.

See ya
