    Eeep!

    Well, you know I don't consider the situation balanced. None of the
priest classes really got what they needed. They got nice stuff, don't get
me wrong, but the core needs that would have "balanced" things didn't get
met with these changes.

    It's an excellent fast heal for bridging gaps in raid healing. It's also
nice as an emergency heal in XP groups. Yeah, the efficiency is the pits.

> 2. I am very glad I never put any AA into healing stuff

    The AA stuff should work on your percentage heals, as it works on my
Complete Heal. And unlike my complete heal (ooh, I went from healing 10500
HPs to 10710!) increases in your heal will actually be useful. Did Verant
give you folks the shaft and exclude the new heal from AA effects?

    You know, I shouldn't make fun of AA effects on CH. We ran the math on
one of our guild warriors, Dachunker. Just by levelling to 65, getting the
"raise STA cap" and "Planar Durability" PoP AA's, and getting the new PoP
HP/STA buffs from guild casters, he'll break the 10500 HP cap on CH. Doesn't
need a single item from PoP to do it. Dachunker tells you, "Stop using
partial heals." You tell Dachunker, "I'm casting CH!"

> 3. I am still debating respec'ing from Alteration to Evocation

    Don't do it. You'll hate yourself in the morning.
