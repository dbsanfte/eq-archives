If you're desperate and creative enough and can find some people to
help you get the adventure flag who don't want to go in with you...but
the dungeon is going to be geared toward however many were in your
group at the time you had the adventure assigned (minimum 4), and
you're not going to be able to achieve the goal of the adventure in
the time given.

Don't understand why people keep asking this, they've said "no" for a
while now...
