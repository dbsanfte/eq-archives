I spent 15 levels or so there as a young ranger and had many a run in
with both of those evil birds. Learned lots of things from them. Like..
being in a building does not save you from aggro or death. That you
*always* keep SoW up and with sufficient time up on the buff to get you
to the nearest zone line (nothing worse than your SoW running out
only halfway to the zone line with The Silver Griffon on your butt).
That The Silver Griffon flies either just at or just above SoW speed
so, if you don't hesitate when you see him, you can beat him to the
zone line. If he hits you once, you're never going to recover. Also
learned that, if you run to the guards in the tower and they get
SG's aggro, keep running for the zone because they can't kill him and
even at 50% health, SG can still slaughter a level 30 ranger.
