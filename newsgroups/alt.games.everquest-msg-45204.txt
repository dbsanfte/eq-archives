1) Go to your guild and buy Lockpicks.

2) While leveling up, take breaks in Befallen occasionally and work
    on Pick Locks until skill is over 125.

3) While leveling up further, work on the door in E. Freeport (why
    here? 200 skill points in Befallen is boring :-) ) until skill is 201
    (must be level 51 by now).

4) Level up to 60, and work on Pick Lock skill at the door to the
    bank vault in N. Freeport (why here? Locking in newbies while
    hidden is a fun way to meet GM's).  Get skill up to 210.

5) Travel to Eastern Wastes and pick the lock.

Viola! You're in!

Alone.
