400K still play after all of the previous "nerfings" mentioned in the
original post. It's obvious that most players can adjust and live with
changes that are made to re-balance the game.

To be honest I don't see 400K people whining about the new changes
that were announced. You may not like them, but you (and I) do not
speak for anyone else.
