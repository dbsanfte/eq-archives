See the election results from 2000 and you will see the percentage is correct. 
As to why, of course no one will ADMIT it has anything to do with welfare or
other giveaway programs, but we know the truth.

Intelligent response.  I guess you must not work, because if you could, you
could do the math.  Heck, I'll give you an example if you can grasp it.  A guy
makes 100k, his income tax is in the 28% bracket, his social security tax is
7.75%.  Gee, there is already 35.5%.  Now, his sales tax if he chooses to buy
anything with what is left is appraoching 8-12% in most areas.  Gee, we're
already up to 43-47% of his income going to taxes.  That doesn't even count the
other dozens of taxes he will pay through property and so on.  So, your
intelligent response is...well IGNORANT.

So is virtually every other program.  Fiscal irresponsibility comes from people
who do not worry over pennies.  Dmes and Repbulicans agree that it should be
reformed, yes, Republicans think it should be lowered while Dems think it
should be expanded.

And who hires them?  I suppose Lazy Joe with 6 kids sucking the welfare in does
that?

There would not be such a gap if not for the fact that half our country
continues to try and improve themselves while the other half chooses not to. 
Don't give me this BS about not having equal opportunity either.  Everyone has
a chance, some choose to have kids they can't afford and buries them into a
life of poverty and others choose to work long hours and make something of
themselves.

Many economists agree that if all the wealth in the US was distributed equally.
a result the Democrats would love, the same people would become wealthy and the
same would be poor because it is their decisions that make wealth, not the
economy, not the President, and not you.

Your entire post shows exactly what the Democratic party is all about.  Taxing
to death the rich and giving it to the poor.  A guy who makes 10 million pays
over 4 milllion in taxes every year, even after the so called loopholes you lke
to whine about, while a guy who makes 10 thousnd a year actually receives money
from the government and pays no taxes, you tell me what is fair and what isnt.
