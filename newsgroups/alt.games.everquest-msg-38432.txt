1.) mapes http://eqatlas.com/
2.) bind is about level 14 but uthers can bind you, if your new i would say
stay where you started you have every thing with in 2 or 3 zones up to about
level 15 to 20, ok kelethin is Gfay zone, kill bees at about level 5 hit orc
hill send a shout every one knows where it is. about 8 or 9 CB is next to
you, i went to 16th there but i say go to oasis about 14 maybe 15.
3.) at your level there maybe a speel quest, umm there should be a BP or
tunic quest to let me get a site, here is a list of Gfay quest may need to
level for some.
P.S. get out and solo kill bees bats orcs, as i said hit orc hill next, you
will more then likelly need a group there. post more if you have any more to
ask
