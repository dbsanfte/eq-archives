Ok, I'll add to the pile of equipment questions.  Character is a 24
cleric, dwarf, deity is Brell Serilis, on Rodcet Nife.  Equip follows
as per magelo except the face, it didn't record that change as I
didn't zone after getting it.  Unfortunately, I do not have Luclin,
and I can not get it at this time due to financial considerations (aka
I'm broke IRL)

Starting stats:

Str: 100 Sta: 95 Dex: 90 Agi: 70
Wis: 118 Int: 60 Cha:45

Maxxed Wis on character creation, rest to Str.

Money on the player: 100 platinum 44 gold 151 silver 211 copper
Money in bank:       27 platinum 5 gold 6 silver 8 copper

I'm not sure if the money is accurate.
