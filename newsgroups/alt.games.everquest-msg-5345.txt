Being a smith from Halas myself, I would recommend running over to Freeport.
All the smithing supplies you will need are available there to get your
smithing up to any level you can afford, just about.  It's a long run, but I
did it without SoW at level 8.  I did get killed by a griffxxx (ene? maybe)
right by the gypsy camp on my first try, but it was otherwise uneventful.
Good luck.
