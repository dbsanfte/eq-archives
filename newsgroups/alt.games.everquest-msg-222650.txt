Fortunately or unfortunately, it works pretty well for me, and trust me, 
I've tried open platforms several times, hoping to find one better. I 
haven't. I don't like the idea of a monopoly either, but it could sure as 
hell be a *lot* worse than it is.

Let's just throw this out there for discussion - why should they *have* 
to be interoperable, anyway? Why is it assumed that you would have a 
better product as a result? Surely you have some idea of what would be 
required of a product to be interoperable with everyone else? How can you 
guarantee that the end result would be better than what MS users 
experience now?

I don't know about Mac users or Linux users, but I know about Windows 
users. We've got it pretty good as it is. You like your Mac or Linux 
workstation, or your Netscape browser? Great. More power to you. Just 
don't buy a BMW sedan and expect to be able to replace a defective 
alternator with the one out of your Honda.
