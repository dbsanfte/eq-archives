<SNIP> A ton of stuff

Well, that was one of the most entertaining flame wars in my mind. Though, I
gotta go with DarkTyger on this one for a number of reasons not the least
being that it is difficult to take someone who goes by the name Boogiepicker
seriously. I think a point that is often skirted around but never touched
directly is that we put a lot of time into our toons. So did a lot of other
people. Even more then that many people are NOT hardcore gamers. My wife
plays, this being the only game she plays in addition to solitaire, and she
doesn't give a plague rat's ass about graphics, etc. She has her friends,
her way of doing things, her EQ. It will take a mass evacuation to get her
off the Drinal server. She loves Star Wars (movies, books, toys etc) and has
absolutely no interest in SWG. None. Her friends, her 51st level bard, her
game is all EQ1. If EQ dies, (and I doubt it will for many years), we will
see a reversal of the server splits that have happened. There simply will be
server combines of the less populated servers until there are just one or
two or 12. And those will go on forever or until Sadam Hussein destroys the
internet. To go back to the original bitch, the Haloween content it is like
an old joke. These two elderly people go to a restaurant and the food is
terrible. Through the whole meal they piss and moan. "The soup is too cold,
the meat has too much salt, it's undercooked, overcooked" Bitch, bitch,
bitch. As they leave, the husband turns to the wife and says, "The worst
part is that the portions were so small" So, to sum up my rant, Dark Tyger
right, Boogiepicker wrong, EQ will live forever or until it no longer
becomes profitable which doesn't look like it's gonna happen anytime soon.
Less profitable, maybe. Unprofitable, I doubt it.

Apikoros 42 Shammy on Drinal who plays cause it's fun and hates all the
pissers and moaners who don't realize it's just a game, even if it is an
absorbing, amazing, time eating hell bent lets enjoy the ride type of thing!
