Killing some more chromodracs in SF, I had occaision to try out
charm tactics some more.  This time I had a cleric partner, so I
was able to be much more cavalier about things.  Several times,
I'd charm a mob (say a drake) and pull another (feaster or
something, lets say) only to get a chromo add on the way back.

While solo, I'd probably have ditched the whole thing right
there, with cleric back up, I'm not so easily dissuaded.  So
several times I stuck it out.  Contrary to my earlier experiment
(single case) charm seemed to break no sooner against a
chromodrac than against any other mob.

I'm thinking that perhaps charm is immune to dispell, or that
charmed pets are in general immune to dispell, or even that pets
in general are immune to dispell.

I'd heard in the past that charming pets is bad when going
against dispelling mobs... this is the first chance I've had to
actually experiment with this.  Is it possible that someone
misunderstood?  Or that its been stealth anti-nerfed?  Or that
only Dragon dispell (which notably works differently than
chromo-dispell) does this?  Or that.. hmm, that Dire Charm (which
is where its been mainly run down) is subject to dispell where
ordinary charm is not?  Or that Bard Charm is immune while other
class charms are not?

Or did I just get extraordinarily lucky 8 times out of ten... and
the two things I'm putting down as typical early breaks were
actually dispells?
