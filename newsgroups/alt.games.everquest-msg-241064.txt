I keep flip-flopping.  On the one hand, I LIKE seeing [level class] Name 
(Race) in the WHO.  It saves people randomly asking me what level and class I 
am and I wanna show off my (admittedly meager so far) levelling 
accomplishments.  But I also wanna make it clear that I /am/ roleplay-y, not 
just some d00d kitty.  I'm not very chatty.

Right now I've got /role on.  I'll probably end up turning it off.  I dunno.
