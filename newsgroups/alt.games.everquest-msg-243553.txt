Hmm, will have to double check, currently running an NVidia FX5200 
without issues.  I do have a newer motherboard that I need to install and 
test out, but I don't recall what it has for an AGP slot off hand.  
Really, I need to break down and upgrade from P3, but, it will be costly, 
as I will have to replace all the ram as well as the processor and 
motherboard.
