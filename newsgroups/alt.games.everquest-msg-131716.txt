I'm anxious to go on my first raid.  I've been playing for 2 years off
and on.  My highest level character is a 26 cleric on Test.  I keep
restarting.  I'm ready to see the rest of the game after two years and I
think I've really found a character and a server I like.  No more
waiting.  I'm ready to take EQ by the horns and see who wins.

I'm a High Elf Cleric.

Well, I was grinding last night in Paludal.  I figured I'd get a couple
more levels there tonight, as the experience there seems absolutely
insane to me.  All the groups were shouting for healers last night, so
I'm not too worried that finding a group will be an issue, but I could
be wrong.  I actually still haven't gotten my level 19 spells yet. (I
was planning on getting those when I log in tonight.)  I didn't want to
stop while the exp was rolling in.

Okay.  Well, I've also got the fact that I've got a little bit more time
to play on Saturday, but I'll use that as buffer room if I don't get
quite as much as I need one night or have bad pulls.
