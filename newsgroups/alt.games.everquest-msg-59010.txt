In his defense, that's not what he says. Even so,
I have a hard time believing his claim, but hey, I
wasn't using Usenet then, so maybe it's true? (Not
the claim that he's been on the net for more than
10 years, but the claim that top-posting was the norm)

By the way, either you or Biz have done something I
think is far worse than cross-posting: You've snipped
an attribution! Who is Biz responding to here? I THINK
it's Darren Christies(sp? Hope I didn't ruin your name),
but I HATE having to rely on my memory for this sort of
thing...

This is the thing most top-posters don't get, I think:
I (and probably you too) like to read posts as conversations,
and conversations flow like you outline below:

Just a quick illustration, to help explain
what Mark is getting at:


1) You're responding to one particular point the OP
made:


TP:

You're wrong! Doody-head!

in article (random string of alnums) Soandso (Fake email address) said:
>Something profound or incredibly dumb
>Some other thing
>Yet more drivel and/or brilliant idea
>Something completely different


BP:

in article (random string of alnums) Soandso (Fake email address) said:
[Snip]
>Some other thing

You're wrong! Doody-head!


Now, which one of these is easiest to read? Which one makes
it easiest to understand just WHERE the OP was wrong?


2) You're responding to several different things the OP
claimed:


TP:

When you say [TP paraphrases OP's statement number 1] you really prove
that you're a doody-head.

Furthermore, claiming that [TP paraphrases OP's statement number 2]
sounds like just the thing a NAZI would say!

And finally, your assertion that [TP paraphrases OP's statement number 4]
is utter lunacy, and is the kind of thing that will lead to the downfall
of our civilization!!!1!

in article (random string of alnums) Soandso (Fake email address) said:
>Statement number 1
>Statement number 2
>Statement number 3
>Statement number 4


BP:

in article (random string of alnums) Soandso (Fake email address) said:
>Statement number 1
Well, that really proves that you're a doody-head!

>Statement number 2
That sounds like just the thing a NAZI would say!

[Snip]

>Statement number 4
This is utter lunacy, and is the kind of thing that will lead to the
downfall of our civilization!!!1!


3) You respond to the article as a whole, summarizing it

This is something I've never seen a top-poster do, and it would look
really silly, but just for argument's sake, I'll include it:


TP:

Hey, that reminds me (tells a similar story)

in article (random string of alnums) Soandso (Fake email address) said:
[Snip: A really cool story about, I don't know, your first Dragon raid
or something]


BP:

in article (random string of alnums) Soandso (Fake email address) said:
[Snip: A really cool story about, I don't know, your first Dragon raid
or something]

Hey, that reminds me (tells a similar story)


This would look insanely silly using top-posting, someone popping in
mid-thread would have to scroll way to the bottom of the top-poster's
story to understand just WHAT it was that reminded him of his story.


4) You respond to the OP AS WELL AS someone the OP is quoting:


TP:

I can't even illustrate this successfully using top-posting, my
fragile widdle brain blue-screens trying to imagine how this would
look...

Woosh!



>Would

Sorry, as much as you'd like to see this thread die,
Godwin's can't be invoked intentionally! =P

>The preceding "rules" of a conversation

>of message content.

What gets me the most about top-posters, is that many
DON'T SNIP, EVER! Snipping is much more important to
me than bottom-posting, YMMV.

And then there's the opposite extreme, those who snip
EVERYTHING, leaving latecomers to scratch their heads,
wondering who the over-zealous snipper just called a
doody-head... /sigh

Bottom-posting, combined with judicious snipping,
addresses both these problems, and makes your article
read like, gasp!, an actual conversation!

What gets me, though, is that the current (whatever it
was 10 or 15 or even 20 years ago) convention is bottom-
posting, and if everyone followed the conventions, Usenet
would be a better place for it.

This is what I tend to do, call me elitist if you want.
I can't be bothered to try to clean up the mess they've
made out of the formatting if they top-post, and I can't
be bothered to connect to my server to download a post
I've already read (but might have forgotten, curse my
bad memory!) if they snip all relevant quotes. As for
people who quote the entire article just to add one or
two lines of drivel, they make a quite satisfactory
sound as they hit the bottom of my killfile...

>Unless you call them a Nazi.

[1]See why top-posting is stupid now?

PS Wow, that became quite a bit longer than I intended...
SORRY FOR THE RAMBLING POST, MY NEWSREADER DOES IT AUTOMATICALLY!
