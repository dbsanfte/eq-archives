Ummm, relax, would be my first words to you.  I never said "might makes
right".  I never said "to be subservent (sic) to the more powerful elements
of the game".  I was merely bringing up the opposite side of the spectrum,
not saying I agree with that side, I just like to play devil's advocate with
my own argument.   Whether you like it or not (and think telling SOE that
you were quitting because of it would help) someone could fairly easily ruin
your reputation.  I said distinictly that "I would probably not have left".
