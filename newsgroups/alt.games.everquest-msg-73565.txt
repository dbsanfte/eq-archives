Well if you don't have luclin have someone that does buy the new lvl
20 DD for you, garrisons mighty mana shock sounds a bit corny but does
142 dmg for 90 mana, and it can be partly resisted, i use both garr
and force shock in OT and they work well, the luclin one is rather
expensive for a lvl 20 spell, for my wizard it costed 31pp with cha 78
:(
