The way I did it (after letting my archery skill to fall by the
wayide) at
level 30, was to find a nice EXP giving blue that didn't hit to hard.
Snare it, beat it to "running" with melee then back off and finish it
with arrows. The goblins in the accursed zone of LoIO worked
especially well.

Remember to use the cheapy store bought arrows (low damaged so you
don't kill too fast)
