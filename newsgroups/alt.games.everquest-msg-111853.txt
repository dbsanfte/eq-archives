Saw this item on allahkazams yesterday and wondered, would a caster with
this item join in melee.

Skull Shaped Wand

Damage 20
Delay 20
+5 to all resists
1hb
Nec, Enc, Wiz, Mage
all races
Proc. Ice Comet (inxs of 1k DD)

It drops of a level 62 mob in AC but would it get used in exp groups or
raids?

Lets say the caster in question got all the cleric buffs he/she could how
much health would a 55= caster have?
3000? Could he/she then (given something like rune to hold off first couple
of hits, maybe) with something like Tolapmuj's robe and Enchanter haste he'd
have about 100% haste (delay would be about 10, 1 swing a second) obviously
lack of offensive and melee skills would make a hit a rare occasion but a
proc does not require a hit to have effect, just a swing. Is a viable option
or is this item just a toy?

CF
/sigh at the waste of another awesome ratio even with out the proc
