That would scare me quite frankly and I get enough of a rush kiting around
something that is within my means, avoiding adds and unlucky resists.  I
just can't understand someone wanting to kite something yellow or red solo,
thinking that exp after an HOUR long kite, outweighs just nuking stuff thats
within your range and basically lets you kill non-stop with little to no
downtime.  I mean, couldn't I earn more exp just kiting around nice con even
or high blue stuff continuoulsy then kiting a yellow or red mob, getting my
ass pounded down to a bubble or 2 of health and most likely *no* mana during
a 20 minute kite??  If not I'll start tracking those yellows and reds
instead =P
