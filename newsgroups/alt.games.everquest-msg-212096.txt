I know this question has been asked a million times before, but thought I'd
ask it again.  What would a newsgroup be without endless repetition right?

With my Beastlord at 53, I'm wondering where the best places to go for
farming plat in the game are.  I know about Rathe Mtns (and due to the fact
that I work nights I get on the game late and have a good chance there) and
the guards in HHK.  Just wondering which of the two give the best return on
plat farming.  Or looking for any suggestions that are better than these two
places.  Not so much looking for places that have rare drops that sell for
10k+ but just a steady source of plat or items that sell well.  Also don't
care so much about xp, just making money.

Also have Brewing at 188, Pottery at 122, and Tailoring at 133, so any ideas
from those would be welcome, though I'd rather just farm it from drops.

Thanks for any suggestions.
