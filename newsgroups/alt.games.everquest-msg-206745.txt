Interesting how many different strategies there are for IV. We always
put 4 tanks, 2 clerics in a group, and had druids/shaman/other clerics
assigned for casting remove curse on the blinded tanks. The tank/cleric
group moved in and got between him and the wall and started attacking
then the rest of the raid would move in behind him. I cant remember
ever clearing the left or right side of the room prior to this.
