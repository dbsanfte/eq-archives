Nope, just checked with my dark elf. Plus in trying to raise her
factions I found out some background on this.

1) BOTH the unkempt preservers and the jagged pine treefolk are
"good" druids in a way. This is why my wood elf druid of tunare was
amiable to both to start. They both just differ politically but have
some similar methods (the jagged pine people actually want you to kill
poachers, etc) The death of either type druid raises the other type.
Treants are sided with jagged pine and raise unkempt when killed.

2) Based on what lindya sowlin (sp) says in west karana, the unkempt
are like a secret society of druids who will kill those who reveal
their location (which is of course, in mountains of rathe) Evidently
that guy who comes and yells about her in the Karanas is one of them.

3) The unkempt preservers still like animals and in fact run around
protecting them in mtns of rathe. They are as close to nature as
regular druids and the animals like them back (this is why you lose
QRGprotected animals, which I believe are the bears of surefall? All
bears? can't really figure this out but some quests in surefall RAISE
it also (qrGprotectedanimals) 

Currently my dark elf cleric is scowl to bears in surefall.. I guess
when I raise the protectors to non kos and the jagged pine above
dubious, so I can do more quests which raise QRGanimals.. I'll see if
that goes up.

4) Therefore since its more of a political thing rather than a druid
thing, both of these druid types are liked by the QRGprotected animals
and both have the same god(s) as far as I can tell, their methods just
differ. Really the unkempt ones might even be called 'closer' to
nature. Both types are moderately millitant though in their methods
which could almost be called "evil" by the other side. So only the
QRGprotected animals are truely "neutral" to the druid types. The
unkempt are more Chaotic neutral and into nature while the Jagged pine
are more neutral good or lawful neutral and allied with the guards of
qeynos (who dislike the unkempt to the point where killing them raises
guards of qeynos) 

The game does not really flesh this whole druid faction thing out much
and it doesn't really give druids a choice of siding with the
preservers since the NK ring is on jagged pine and the preservers
don't really have many quests and no trainers (they have some dumb
solvedi scimitar quest for a drop from a VERY rare mob)
Besides the fact there is really no unkempt druids content/quests,
they are only the druids in that area of mtn rathe and you don't even 
encounter them in the rest of the game.

Except for a qeynos quest where you get a wood chip or something for
killing an unkempt druid assassin, it really has no part in the game.
Its sort of like democrats and republicans, if they killed each other
;) 

Its really a shame that this is not in the game more or that it
doesn't give druids two epic paths, in the way that good and evil
clerics have two epic paths as far as faction (though its still the
same mobs I guess)

I did notice at the planes of power site that there IS an evil treant
on one of the planes or something. I wish this kind of tied into
things and it raised druid factions to kill it but I doubt if it will.
If it was the opposite evil plane of the plane of growth that would be
cool.
