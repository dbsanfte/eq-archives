This sounds alot like my very first EQ experience. I started a human ranger and
began my life in surefall glade, one of the most deserted areas in the game.
I stood around for ten minutes in windowed mode trying to figure out how to
move. I didnt know about the /who command and thought all the NPC's were other
players so i went up to talk to someone, bearing in mind i didnt know how to
open the chat box. Loading Please wait...
Then i couldnt find my way out of the tunnel because it was too dark and after
a few minutes just said "SHIT!!" luckily a passing player heard me and gave me
a fire beetle eye.
After many more mishaps i deleted that character, read the manual, read this
newsgroup and a bunch of websites and though i still know jack shit and still
get confused with the acronyms of places i know enough to play the game and
have alot of fun.
I doubt there are many whose first experience wasnt a bit shit but stick with
it, it gets alot better. I'd give you advice about how to play the game but
there are much more knowledgeable folks here for that.

Btw my first ever character was called Fharen, can anyone else remember their
first?
