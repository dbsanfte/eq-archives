Not a lot of stuff in memory that can be hacked.  Falling damage, yes, but
that's not very useful as how often do you need to fall large distances with
no levitate?  Anything that ShowEQ displays is stored in the client's
memory, yes, but it's not like you can go around hacking mob positions or hp
because the server is the authority on the real data.  Even if you did make
the client believe a mob was somewhere else, the server wouldn't let you
attack it because it would know better.  And of course, even if you could,
having windowed mode disabled would not make it much harder to do so.
