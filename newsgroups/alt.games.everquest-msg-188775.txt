Recently, I was in Half Price books. They had Red Alert 2 for $8 and
Yuri's Revenge for $10. Well... $18 later and I'm through the single
player Allied Game, and 2 from the end of the Soviet spg. I'm about 2
into the Allied Yuri game. :)

And once in awhile, I strill drop in Starfleet Battles II and Sim City
4.
