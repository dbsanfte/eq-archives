I am not falling on either side of this issue but offering perhaps a
perspective. A point of view if you will from a devils advocate.

The playing of EQ can be easily equated to a hobby of sorts. How much money
a person devotes to his hobby and time is up to them. Take fishing for
example, a person can easily spend thousands and thousands of dollars for
the boat, rods, reels, and the latest lures, because it pleases him to do
so, to catch a Bass. A child will get a 10$ fishing kit at the store,
through a worm on it or some cheap ass lure and catch the same fish. Both
are deriving pleasure from the exact same act with varying degrees of
financial implication. The child on the shore with the Bass looking at the
Pro in the Boat with the same Bass does not usually judge the other person
as lame but recognizes that they both enjoy fishing.

If a person decides to spend hundreds of dollars on items and platinum and
enjoy his hobby of playing EQ then great. Telling a person they are lame
for investing in their hobby the way they want is just as lame.

If you do not have the money to play the game as you want then don't spend
it.

I also believe that the EULA specifically prohibits the sale of such items,
but does not say anything about the purchase of such items. ( not accounts,
i am talking about Items)

Just a thought, not an attack...   :)
