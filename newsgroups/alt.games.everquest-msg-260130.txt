Actually, I tend to agree with the cleric here (in my uninformed opinion,
which perhaps will change if / when I ever see the script in action.).

I guess it comes down to "where you draw the line between strategy and
exploits?"  SOE has never been clear or consistant on this.    What you're
doing, clearing aggro so you can med to full and rebuff, sounds not so much
different from what Conquest was banned for, back in the Velious days.   If
I remember correctly, they hid somewhere that the 4'th warder in Sleepers
couldn't reach them while they rebuffed / medded / etc. (1)

You do however bring up... probably the perfect counterexample.  SOE was
even asked about the Dain script, IIRC... and responded on thier official
boards that they did not see that "strategy" as an exploit, because the
bottom of the well "was the only logical place he could be fought."
(Despite the fact that if they ever *really* intemded him to go there, they
would have added pathing for him to get there, rathter than having him warp
because he was stuck with no path to get to the players.)

And if you really wanted to go overboard, I suppose you could take the
(somewhat ridiculous) position that every time you hide from a mob's AE,
you're "circumventing the developer's intent" and making the encounter much
easier on your force.   There is definitely a line though...  which is
something that a lot of people seem not to understand, judging from the
amount of morons we get in here claiming that exploiting pathing bugs and
safe points where a mob can't hit you is "just good strategy."


(1)  There were also charges that they built aggro while down there, by
having the main tank right click a soulfire repeatedly, but this charge was
withdrawn by SOE when they checked the records and saw the tank did not have
that item in his inventory.  They let the banning stand though  based on the
resting / rebuffing / etc.   IMO what really sunk Conquest in that situation
was that SOE had logs of them referring to thier strategies as exploits in
guildchat.  (The guild claimed it was an "in joke" among them.)
