When we tried it, our chanters charm's were breaking *damn* fast, it was
happening so fast they werent even having time to send them in, when they
finally did have them under control they proceeded to attack, broke charm
right quick and of course.. it ended very very fast after that.


We were there to kite glykus around, and get some ornate boots for our
guilds (alliance raid, 2 guilds) and then kill glykus afterwards. there were
maybe 3 groups of us. once we finished that a chanter who normally coulda
done it with just him and a cleric, couldnt get it done, so they added
another chanter, and 2 or 3 more healers as backup.


Eventually we lead a 5 group raid against the bugger and dropped him that
way.. barely though, so maybe we just suck. :(



I know what they actually did, if every mob in the zone has increased
resistance to charm, or if its just once they get within range of overseer
or what. (I guess they also coulda changed it back since, this is from 3-4
months ago)


I suppose it also could have been an incredible run of bad luck, but ive
heard the story from so many sources now I just took it to be true.
