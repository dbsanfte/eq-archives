Yet the amount of time spent is massive. You have to do 400 successful
combines for each skill. (nearly 800 combines total) For a skill like
Jewelry Making or Alchemy it would be worth it as the cost to raise a
skill to that level is, if not a considerable amount of coin, at least
an amount that would be difficult for a low level character to spend.
Though I did to level 54 there for Alchemy, Fletching, and Jewelry
Making. I already had the rest over 54.

Let me give you a suggestion to make the process a little less painful
though.

The way SoE wants you to do it is get a stack of components by asking
the NPC for them. They will not give you another stack until you have
combined all that you have, and given them all back in to the NPC.
(Unstacked please) This breaks the quest up into about 40 distinct
parts. Each request for materials followed by combining then turning
the pieces in. Repeat about 40 times per each skill you intend to
raise. It takes a while.

However if we derail SoE's plans we can use a little efficiency of
scale. Make a hot key to say the quest phrase. Then drop the stuff on
your cursor to the ground. Ask again. Do this about 10 times. (10
Stacks of material on the ground.) Pick them all up. Start to work.
Experiment until you have succeeded once then you can use the new
interface to do the combines. My character with a wisdom of about 230
got all the skill ups in the first stack of material, so I used about
8 1/2 stacks on average to complete the 100 combines the NPC wants.
But those of a lesser WIS or INT might use up nearly the whole 10
stacks. I recommend making 108 combines, for some reason giving the
NPC just 100 would not be enough sometimes. Turn them all in. Say the
quest phrase another 10 times dropping the stuff on the ground. Rinse
and repeat. This makes the whole process take about 1/2 to 1/3 the
time it might otherwise take, due to the efficiency.
