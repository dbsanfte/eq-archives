Vah shir are supposed to be generally neutral from stuff verant has
said. 

Everyone will start with the same faction with them probably (like
thurg dwarves in velious) and its more than likely that vahshir will
be apprehensive or better in all good cities. I bet they are kos to
evil cities though. Vah shir are definately not "evil."
