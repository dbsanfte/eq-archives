I saw in one of these postings someone discussing a problem they were
having with a Cable/DSL router causing a disconnect every 12 to 15
minutes or so.  I am suffering from this same problem.  I know that my
router is causing this problem as it only started happening after I
installed it and it's only happening to EQ (other programs, e.g. DAoC
and UT2003 work without this problem).

I have a LinkSys Cable/DSL router model BEFSR81 version 2.  It's using
firmware version 2.42.7.1 dated Jun 25, 2002.

I remember the person stating they went to an earlier version of
firmware to correct the problem.  Has anyone had a similiar problem
with this specific router and firmware version and what did you do to
fix it?  I would greatly appreciate any help I can get in this regard
as only playing for 15 minutes is really aggravating especially since
I'm trying to explore some of what PoP has to offer.
