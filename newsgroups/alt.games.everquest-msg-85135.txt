You don't have any point to get anywhere. Unless you count showing
yourself to be a selfish prick a "point".


>Stealing an entire dungeon is quite beyond my capabilities.

You suck. Period. A L45 could kill of CB in one spell. You were
already "happily" killing about a third of the spawns.


>There were more than enough mobs to go around.

Oh yeah suuure there was, thats why those evil lowbies were so out of
line for actually wanting to fight something their level.

I wish I was there. I would have logged in MY main and taken every
kill your lowbies tried to get - before they could hit it of course..
Let's call it "faction work"...

You sure sound amused. You're so mad you're spelling two letter words
wrong.

:-)

Why don't you post with your REAL name, coward?

Tommy Five-Tone: "Did I miss anything?"

Hudson Hawk: "Gates tries to blackmail me, you ask me 'Did I miss
anything.' Gates gets killed, you say 'Did I miss anything.' I bet
you went up to Mrs. Lincoln at the Ford Theatre and said 'How was
the show? Did I miss anything?'"
