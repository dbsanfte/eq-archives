Actually, it crashes within 3-5 min of logon.  An error appears "behind" EQ.
Error message reads: Mprexe.exe has caused an invalid page fault in
KRNL386.exe at 0002:0000761b.  This causes an error in EQgame.exe, which
causes an error in Msgsrv.exe that locks up my computer and requires a
reboot. EQ is the only program giving me trouble.

DSL from the local phone company.  Usually a rock solid connection.

None.  That was my first suspect, so nowadays I run on a fresh boot with the
only things running being my DSL connection program and Systray.

Didn't think that was the problem... I'll try that.

Did that... No help.  But when EQ runs, it's bloody beautiful...
> 7. Test EQ for stability

Been doing that since Luclin... Still not stable.  Two things stick out in
my mind...
1. Since EQ seems to be fragging my HD at an alarming rate, and since SOL
was installed after the rest of EQ (with all my other software in between)
would un-installing EQ, defragging, and re-installing EQ cut down on the
frag trouble?

2. It has been suggested more than once to re-format my HD.  Can someone
tell me WHY this would make a difference?  Those who have suggested it in
the past have been unable to answer that question to my satisfaction.

Thanks for the help so far...
