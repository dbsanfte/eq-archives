<snip rants>

Here's my rant. I may have ranted about it in the age channel, or at
least parts of it.

We were grouping in PoV Inner.  I don't recall the group makeup very
well, I know we had a druid to pull, a shaman/pallie duo(who i suspect
were married/living together), my (now) 65 BST friend, and me, a (now)63
necro.  Oh, and a cleric, I think.  My first hint was when my BST friend
/told me his pre-slows weren't getting overwritten by the shamans.  I
inquire about this(via /tells...at first) and get a response that she's
trying, but she's getting resisted.  I knew that was bullshit 'cause I
had spell effect on AND other PC spells, and I never saw her cast, or if
she did, it was at 15% of mob health.  First clue.  Second clue: the
shaman asked me to.....you guessed it, twitch her.  I did some
twitching, all right, mostly about the facial region.  My response was
to canni(Yep, she had full health).  At this point, the pallie sent me a
/tell to back off, and stop harassing the shaman.  Now, I am polite to a
fault.  The BST wanted to replace her, but I lacked the courage to do
so.  The group broke up a short time after.
