I had the tuturial, was the first thing about EQ i tried. And i SO wish 
i hadnt spend that time in the tuturial.
Basically you cound only use the function it wanted to show you at the 
time, so if you werent at the jump part, you couldnt jump, werent at 
attack part you couldnt attack and so on, so i spend a lot of time 
cursing because the keys i set up, and all the commands written in the 
manual didnt work.

Unless they changed that in a later version that i got, im happy they 
removed the tuturial to spare the new players that experience.
