OK, so i see lots and lots of people both here in NG's and on my guild's
boards posting their
Magelo profiles, but i am born a paranoid sceptic to anything that looks and
sounds good :)

So my question on Magelo is this, has it been proven beyond reasonable doubt
that it,
 does not send information to the database that is of danger to your
account's integrity
(IE: sending password and account name) and since it seems to tap into the
datastream to
build database info, is it bannable and/or detectable by VI??
