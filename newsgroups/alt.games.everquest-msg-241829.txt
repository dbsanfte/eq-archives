Suppose some company wants to modernize, but they
suspect that some of their customers won't knowingly go along,
and ,,,,,with no disclosure of future intentions,,,
they offer a long term contract, shortly before they pull the plug
on certain (non-upgrading) customers, who would not necesssarily
know that they must upgrade..or else...... is that ethical?
