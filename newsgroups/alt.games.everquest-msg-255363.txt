I disagree that an alternative path is necessarily an 'easier' one.

Envy? Don't flatter yourself. 

You know what I'd like to see, 'raid gear'. Ie. gear with stats that 
only turn on when your in an 18 or 26 or 48 or 72 person raid. If the 
raiders only need their uber gear becuase they raid, and us single 
groupers and soloers 'don't need that gear' then raiders don't need it 
either when they deign to walk with mortals.

Raiders still have their uber shite when their raiding, and when SOE is 
designing and tuning single group content they don't have to worry about 
massive discrepencies between raiders and other players capabilties.

Designate some zones raid zones, others non-raid zones, so that while 
you can form your raid anywhere, the stats don't amp up until you are in 
a raid zone. Finally stick the raid mobs in their own minizones with 
zone-ins deep inside regular single group zones, or instanced dungeons, 
so that raiders don't get a ridiculous edge when fighting the single 
group content in raid zones. The gear that drops in raid zones off raid 
mobs is the same as regular gear that drops in regular zones, with the 
exception that it has +raid stats... e.g. +10 int +F2 normally, and an 
additional +3 int +FT2 +10vsMagic when part of a raid in a raid zone.

Voila, gear discrepencies are resolved. And now people who don't group 
or raid truly do not need or even really benefit from 'raid gear', yet 
the raiders can still boast having the best gear in the game, and raid 
progression etc can remain intact, without people gearing up in the 
bazaar and then skipping right to joining and endgame raid guild.

That is what I would like to see, I think.

Thoughts?

Individual advancement has always been everything, right from day one. 
There is nothing else in EQ, except maybe an over priced MSN Messenger.
