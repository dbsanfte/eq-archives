If you did not grow up in the warrens as a newbie (many didn't - growing up
in Kelethin and Crushbone I never did) it can be a real pain in the butt
getting a person to guide you out.  I spent about 30min in the warrens
looking for a zoneout. Friggin huge PITA.
I welcome this new stone with open arms.
