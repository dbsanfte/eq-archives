There are a fair few places you can get decent loot at that level, Rygor
orcs in Velious, for example but, it does boil down to you winning the
rolls. I would suggest moving to Velious as there seems to be better
opputinities for mid level characters (Kunark offers great exp but the loot
and plat drops aren't that amazing, actually they're pretty crap)
If it's just some quick plat then I'd have to go along with the Giants in
Rathe, I never used them myself but I found other ways of making money, that
prolly won't interest you.
