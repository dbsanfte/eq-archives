I accept donations but will happily rez for free, if asked I say
whatever you can afford. I love doing driveby rezzes, I've really made
some peoples day that way. Of course guildies are never charged. I'll
happily trade a rez for clarity or other buffs. I dont rez anonymous
people or people who died from dueling (unless you offer me obscene
amounts of plat). Be polite, dont make me wait for you to accept the
rez. I usually throw in a free heal unless you have annoyed me or
promised to pay and didnt'. If I'm grouped it all depends on how the
group is doing, do I have clarity etc. If mana is good and I'm not
going to risk the group I'll rez you, however you must drag to me and
I may ask you to wait until mana comes up, fight is over or something
like that. And if you died doing something stupid and ten minutes
after I rezzed you  you died doing the same thing again dont bother
asking. Its hard to make my no rez list. Training my group will do it.
Getting me to travel halfway across the world to rez your group and
then not paying will do it. Continuing to bother me after I have said
no will do it.
