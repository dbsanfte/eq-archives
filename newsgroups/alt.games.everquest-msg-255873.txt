Sounds like 1-2 enchanters and 4 offtanks then?  Can you tell the mezzable 
from the un?

I don't suppose any of those guys are charmable... :)  Our enchanters are 
bored lately, and wondering what a six-enc group could accomplish. :)

>and you can't kill them. 

Is that as in, you need shissarbane to kill them, or they're totally 
immune to bloody everything and depop when emp dies?  It sounds like, if 
theyconveniently depop when emp dies, it's probably not -worth- trying to 
kill them.
