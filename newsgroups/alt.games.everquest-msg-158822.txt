I'm a little late seeing this, but I think this is slightly wrong. I
believe once you have made the dual wield check the first time
(sucessfully), the offhand weapon makes its own double attack check.
You don't need to double on the primary to get a double on the
secondary. I have seen many many MANY attack rounds like this:

1
1
12

What that is is the secondary hitting twice and the primary only
swinging once. (I used weapons with the same delay as much as
possible)

Another neat thing is the secondary hits are calculated first. So if
your dual wield goes off, it checks the secondary weapon for a double
attack. Then calculates and sends the damage from that. Only then does
it make the double attack roll for the primary, and work out its hits.

Dunno if anyone will even see this in such an old thread, but I got
about 200 levels worth of melees, over three years, and I paid
attention to what was happening pretty closely, and I wanted to share.
:-p
