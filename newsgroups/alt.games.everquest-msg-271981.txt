If this is the Crusader->Paladin 'kill challenging gnolls' quest, I
did it all in about an hour by hanging around Keep of the Ardent
Needle. Solo Sabretooth battlers (blue to me at 19) spawn regularly
there. Just keep away from the group mobs by the tents. There's also a
lot of resource nodes in the area, so you can raise harvesting skills
while you wait for pops.

It seems to me a lot of people take two steps outside of Qeynos and
expect to see a few hundred solo mobs standing in line waiting to be
killed. Before saying "There's nothing there!!!", try exploring a bit.
