Kill anything that resembles a spider and never sell the silks to
vendors. In fact, to be a cagey entrepeneour, if you see any silks *on*
the vendors, buy them up. Grab yourself a small sewing kit and start
combining all the spider silks, two at a time, into silk swatches. They
stack and can be stored easily. Likewise, keep killing spiderling types
and combine all the spiderling silks, again, two at a time, into silk
threads. Tailors and smiths are still in a fair feeding frenzy for this
stuff on many servers because of the Velious shawl quests, and the
rumored upcoming nerfs to tradeskill trivial levels. Auction that you
have them and see what people offer. I wouldn't take less than 2 plat
per swatch (40 PP per stack. Sell them by the stack, not singly) or 1 PP
per thread. (20 PP per stack.) They are light so they store easily, and
you can afford to sit on them until a motivated buyer comes along.

Combining them in the sewing kit never fails and will get your tailoring
skill up to 15? 16? Somewhere in there. If you can get your skill up a
good bit further in the high forties, you can safely start using the
threads that you create to combine with a LQ pelt of most any kind and
make leather paddings. Auctioning these will bring the blacksmiths a
running and paying you some fat plat for them.

All the cats, wolves, and bears *can* drop a LQ pelt, but they seem to
be rare. But if you get yourself a skinning knife (auction to have a
blacksmith make you one... cheap item) and put it in the sewing kit with
a MQ or HQ pelt, it will decrease the quality of the pelt. So, one
combine for a MQ or two combines for an HQ will get you an LQ pelt you
can use for making paddings. These are things where the low level
charcter/tailor can make some serious cash if you are patient in your
/auctioning to sell them. In fact, never do the /auction first. Go to
GFey, or whatever your servers auction zone is, and hang out a bit first
to see if anyone is auctioning to buy them. They will be your motivated
buyers who will drool over the stacks of these items that you
accumulate. 

Great cash at your level.

Of course, if you are on Xev, don't even bother auctioning. Give me a
tell and I'll come to you and buy them up. :-)
