1) its 'he'

2) My usage of universal is meant it along the same lines as the OP who 
initially said it was a universal browser.

3) The point is not 'what browser is most universal'... its what target 
platform should i spec my site too... and the answer should never be 
'IE5 or later + ActiveX' without a very good considered reason. HTML 
4.01 Transitional is a lot more sensible.

A larger segment of the user base supports this platform. That makes it 
'more universal' to use the operating phrase.

/sigh.

1) I didn't use the term first

2) IE is the most common deployed 'brand'. Its not a browser its a whole 
collection of browsers with vast incompatibilities from one to the next. 
Calling IE universal is like calling Windows universal. If you write a 
non-trial program for windows odds are it will still fail on at least 
one version of it.

3) w3c html specs are much more sensible to write against than selecting 
a particular browser brand (and version of that browser) and writing 
against that.

4) from a devs point of view browser is irrelevant. write to the most 
important widely supported spec. let the user choose their own browser. 
that's whe whole point of the spec. The only time its important to the 
devs to actually care about the browser is during debugging...but if the 
browser was up to the spec it wouldn't be an issue.
