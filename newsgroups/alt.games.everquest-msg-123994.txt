[In this post, "day" means when the sun is up, and we'll operate on local
solar time...none of this timezone crap]

It depends on what you think is the more significant event for timekeeping:
sunrise or noon.

If you favor noon, then you see the longer days of summer as due to the sun
rising earlier each day, and setting later.  Clocks should say "12:00" every
day at noon.  Daylight savings time then appears evil, because it makes noon
not coincide with 12:00.

However, a good argument can be made that sunrise is more important than
noon for timekeeping.  To those who favor that point of view, the most
sensible thing would be to make the clocks say "6:00" every day at sunrise.
The longer days of summer are longer then because the sun stays up longer,
rather than rising earlier.

Offhand, I can't think of anything that people do (other than shootouts in
the Old West :-)) that naturally occurs at or ties in with noon.  Plenty of
things tie in with sunrise (or dawn...to which the same arguments apply).

If we did not have accurate clocks, so that the clock needed to be set every
day to stay accurate, my guess is that the sunrise based system would be the
clear winner.  For most of human history, it fit in better than the noon
based system.

However, when you have reasonably accurate clocks, and so don't want to have
to fiddle with the clock every day, basing off noon (or, equivalently, for
purposes of this discussion, midnight) makes sense.  (Well, at least until
alarm clocks are invented...and then you end up having to fiddle with the
alarm time as the sunrise time changes).

I see Daylight Savings Time as being a compromise between the convenience of
a noon based system (no daily clock adjustment required) and the logic of a
sunrise based system (matches human activity better).  Instead of making
daily clock adjustments to match sunrise, we wait until it gets a fair
amount out of whack, and then make one big adjustment.
