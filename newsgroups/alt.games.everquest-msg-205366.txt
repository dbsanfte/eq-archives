Actually, no, you don't.  But, if your STA is under 100 you will slow
down a bit, at which point, if you were barely looking up enough to
stay on surface, you will start to slowly sink.  This is easily
corrected by using mouselook (or a few taps on <Page Up> key) to
adjust your view upwards.  Various of my characters have totalled
hours swimming on the surface without EB and with their stamina bars
wiped, none have drowned.
