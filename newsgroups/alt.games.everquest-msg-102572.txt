I've seen this a few places.  I'm a ranger and use track everywhere, much
easier to get around.  In a few places there will be a gap in the list for
tracking, I'll click on the gap and be able to track whatever it is, I get '
is straight ahead'; ' is to the left' messages.  In Shar Vahl, I tracked one
to the horses that are standing around the town.  Not sure if the unnamed is
the horse or not just that that is where it ended up.  Stopped worrying
about it for a while till I saw the same thing in Lavastorm Mountains.  I
was curious enough to wander around trying to find out what it was.  Ended
up tracking to a pool of lava.  No way am I gonna go into that pool to try
to click on it just for curiousity's sake.  Anybody else seen this strange
gapping on track list?
