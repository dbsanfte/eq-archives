I'v seen these little rat like wolves on occasion running around. I
figured it was just some other classes form spell until I ran up to
the spires in NK in WF and a druid wanted to know how I made myself so
small. My screen showed me to be a full size wolf, but she said I was
small. I clicked off the form and recast, she said I looked as it
should that time. Hmm a graphics bug?
