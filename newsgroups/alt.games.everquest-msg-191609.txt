My brother-in-law is trying to set up a LAN in our house so we can all
make use of a DSL line.

There will be three computers on the line, One new Dell using Windows
XP Home, One using Mellineum and mine using Win98.

We got a hub and got his computer srt up and connected to the hub and
making connection to the bellsouth DSL line... everything working
nicely.

My sister's computer, the one using Millenium, is locking up and
giving a ton of trouble.

Mine is not making the connection thru the hub at all.

Anybody got any advise on what we need to do? Got any URL's to sites
written in plain english for the terminally technology challenged that
might help us get this thing working?
