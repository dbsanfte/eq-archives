I guess they didn't put it in for the lowest resolution because the
screen would get way too crowded. When I open the AA menu (I use the
lowest resolution), the lowest part of the menu overlaps with my chat
window, and a see through inventory would also pretty much invariably
have to overlap with that and other windows.
