}Indeed. More is better :)

Just to provide a bit further information, I just got off the phone with 
a professor specializing in measuring the activity of channel proteins, 
like the ones in our eyes that initiate the action potential that 
eventually gets transmitted to the brain.

He thinks I'm barking up the wrong tree trying to figure out maximum 
useful refresh rate from that, since it probably involves higher-order 
processing of the signal deeper in the brain.  But he did say that the 
signal transduction cascade does take about 100-200 msec to go from photon 
hitting the retina to a signal leaving along a neuron.  Which means right 
at that step, there's a 0.1-0.2 second lag between something happening in 
the real world, and our brain perceiving it. (The travel time of light to 
the eye, and the travel time of the action potential along neurons are 
generally negligible compared to that 100 msec.)

Previous things I've read suggest that 100 msec is pretty much the cap on 
human response time to a visual stimuli.  I'm just suprised to learn that 
that particular chain of chemical events counts for such a large fraction 
of that.

Now, if only I could somehow use that information to help me mezz mobs 
faster... hmm. :)
