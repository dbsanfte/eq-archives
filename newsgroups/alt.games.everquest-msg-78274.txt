Added Umbra line (worked for me..great stuff)  and noticed in the
eqclient.ini file that I have all the models except Troll,Ogre, Halfling,
Gnome and Elemental set to true. (eg,  UseLuclinDarkElfMale:True). Also have
VisitedLuclinOptioins set to true.

not having Luclin, I thought this was all a bit strange ? Weird defaults if
that what they are. Perhaps i should reneder them all false?

Cheers.
