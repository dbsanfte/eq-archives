[45 cleric]

Ok, so I'm wandering around Norrath the other night and end up in
Oasis thinking that surely, by now, I can roast specs.  Heck, I have
the undead fear and the undead DD (585dd +3 casts = 1 dead spec).  
A friend (Shaman) meets me there, single pulls a few and I pretty much
have my way with them.  Heck, they were begging me to stop when not
running away with their robes hiked up.  Decent experience, I'm pretty
happy about the whole thing.  Downright exuberant, to be honest.

So tonight I log on and figure that I should be able to solo these bad
boys. 

One problem:

I can't seem to single pull for beans!  

I tried getting as far from the island as possible, targetting the
closest one, and when just barely within range, casting "Cancel
Magic".  I can't prove it, but I thought that was maybe a 'low aggro'
(whatever the hell that might mean in this context) spell.  Nope,
pulled the entire island.  Led 'em down to S Ro (while /shouting like
a bard), zoned.  Came back, picked off a few straglers.  Not bad, but
the ones I don't pick off go on to terrorize the zone.  Not making me
real popular after the second time.  Yeah, I know - shouldn't have
done it twice, but wanted to try pulling again just in case...

So.  Any thoughts on how I could pull those bad boys off the island 1
or 2 at a time?  What do I have in my spell arsenal that I'm
overlooking?  Root seems to be resisted by them too often to count on
that.
