I need help picking a name for my Beastlord.  Originally I was going to play
him just like I would any alt, but have since decided to use him to make
essence emeralds.  I don't play on Firona Vie, nor am I engaged in any kind
of regular role playing on a day to day basis (other than a distain for
gnomes and halflings on the part of my Necromancer and Cleric).  I do,
however, like for my characters to have good names.  Since my beastlord will
be employed in leveling from 46 to 47 over and over again only to give away
a part of his soul to that others can be resurected, I want his surname to
be related to this purpose.  Sadly, I haven't been able to come up with any
names I care for.  Thus, I turn to the a.g.e community, with its now
abundant roleplay server characters, for assistance.  Anyone care to make
some suggestions?
