That's what the manual says, but it lies.

I did some tests.  They weren't very comprehensive, but I found
that while level 1 corpses do poof pretty fast, level 3-4-5
corpses with stuff on them last FAR, FAR longer than the 30
minutes promised by the manual.  I had one level 4 corpse last
24 hours online.
