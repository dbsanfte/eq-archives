I see that The Sleeper has awakened now on Morell-Thule

http://pub96.ezboard.com/ffurysedge82244frm11.showMessage?topicID=20.topic

How many servers has it been awakened on now?

Anyone care to speculate on what may transpire once the script has run on
all servers?

Anyone else think it sucks that Verant don't repop the warders at least so
that others may battle these beasties? Seems like fun battles to be had let
alone the nice loot drops.

Anyone here from Xegony in a guild that is close to it?
