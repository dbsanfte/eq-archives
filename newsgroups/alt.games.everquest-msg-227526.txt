A few other places to try:
Velks - its not heavily camped these days on Povar at least.  Ground
floor mobs should be decent exp at 55 - it was the main exp spot for
55 to 60 pre whatever came next!  Should be able to collect a healthy
supply of threads for your shawl too.

Kael - hang around the zone & pull to there.  Mobs should be duoable
at 55, again I would DC there at 60 all the way from the arena to the
zone.

Fungus Grove - havn't been there in a while but it used to be pretty
good.  I used to AE group there back in the day & solo it a 60 with
DC.  'Shrooms & Shadel could easily be single pulled but things in the
back had a habit of coming with friends.  Plus it was tricky getting a
dc pet there.

Skyshrine - not so sure about that one.  I used to spend time there
working my faction up & took my druid for company & exp.  He got some
but wouldn't like to say how much.

Maidens Eye - possibly.  Again it was a while ago since I hunted there
& you may have the same problem as DSP.  Any of the shard zones are
going to be ravaged by 65's trying to get them.

Only thing to bear in mind with SoV zones is your faction.  May be
less of an issue today but the faction based quests meant that hours
would be spent adjusting faction one way then another.  If you guild
is raiding WToV, NToV, HoT may be worth avoiding the appropriate SoV
zones.
