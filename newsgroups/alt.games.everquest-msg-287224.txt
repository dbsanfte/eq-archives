With the holidays on their way soon, many people will be beefing up
kitchens to handle the increased demand for 'fit for a king' meals.
Not being a professional Chef shouldn't stop you from being able to
cook like one. But, you'll need the right tools to create those
tantalizing dishes. Read on and find out the five tools that no
kitchen cook should be without.

Mixing Bowls

Make sure that you have a good, quality set of mixing bowls on hand -
the bigger the better! Many dishes need to be beaten, blended or
mixed. You'll be glad you didn't skimp on the mixing bowls when you
need to perform any of those tasks. Most professional chefs prefer to
use stainless steel mixing bowls. However, there are many quality
plastic sets available, like the ones made by OXO. But be aware that
plastic bowls can become hard to clean over time, especially if used
for heavy duty sauces, and may need to be replaced.

Pre-Seasoned Cookware

Cast iron skillets, pots and pans have long been a choice of the pros.
But, cast iron cookware can be a little daunting. Seasoning, pre-
seasoning, re-seasoning, cooking the seasonings in, oils to use, etc.
to ensure your skillet is ready, is a hassle many cooks would rather
not deal with. Now you don't have to. You can buy cast iron cookware
galore - already seasoned - so that you have no fuss and still get the
same great benefits of those using simple cast iron. Lodge is a well
known maker of pre-seasoned cookware and offers many different types
of cast iron cookware. Be aware -soap nor dishwashers should be used
for your prized possessions.
