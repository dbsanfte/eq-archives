If you're starting with everyone unflagged, I don't know how you'd
do them out of order, since he gives you the trial based on how far
along you are (AFAIK).

On that note, my regular group with my BL and Mage replaced by a 65 mage
and 65 'chanter (a bit more aa's than me, but not as nicely geared)
beat the boss yesterday in the sewer trials.  They said he really wasn't
that hard.
