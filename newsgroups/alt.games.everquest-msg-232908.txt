Okey, I have a strange and hard to diagnose problem that's keeping me 
away from EQ, and I hope that maybe the colossal minds in this NG can 
shed some light on the causes.

The story so far:

I have a Mac and a PC on my desk. The PC is for games, the Mac for 
everything else. They share a USB keyboard, mouse, and two monitors (one 
for the Mac only, one shared) They are both connected to the internet 
via a NetGear ADSL router, with no problems whatsoever for the last few 
months. Until a few days ago...

Normally, I have both the PC and the Mac running 24 hours a day, either 
idle or running SETI@home, but recently I started getting some pangs of 
guilt about the wasted energy, and decided to go green. First, I started 
letting the Mac go to Sleep, and found no problems whatsoever, so next I 
tried Standby Mode on the PC. Then, the nightmare started.

Firstly, I wasn't able to actually wake it up, since it seemed unable to 
find the USB keyboard (I'm sharing a USB keyboard and mouse with a KVM 
switch. Works well if I'm careful at boot time), so I reset it. When it 
came back up, it had stopped seeing the router. The OS (Windows XP Home) 
claims there is nothing wrong with the network connection, and it's 
happily reporting zero packets in and zero packets out. There is no 
activity visible on the card itself, the lights are dead, but the 
Hardware Manager tells me that the device is working properly. It cannot 
ping the Mac or the router itself, and I cannot ping it from the Mac *or* 
from the router. The port number on the router is not lit up anymore, 
which means it's not getting any packets at all from the PC, but the 
icon on the PC's system tray is that of a working connection, not the 
red "disconnected" one.

I've pulled out and reset the Ethernet cables, and even connected it to 
a different port in the router, in case that port had died for some 
reason. I've reset the router. I have uninstalled the network card via 
the Hardware manager and let Windows find it again (I haven't physically 
pulled it out yet, though... leaving that for last). I have made sure 
that all the TCP/IP settings are back to their last working 
configuration. I'm out of things to try.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance for all input.
