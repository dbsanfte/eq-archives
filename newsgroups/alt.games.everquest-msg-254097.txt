One thing about Everquest that may be different from other games
you've played is that almost everything drops from mobs.  Want to
tailor - kill spiderlings and spiders for silk, wolves, cats and bears
for hides.  Want to smith - kill orcs (in Crystal Caverns) for velium,
grimlings (in/outside Acrylia caverns) for acrylia. Etc.

The other ways of getting things for tradeskills is foraging
(exclusive to rangers, druids, bards and Iksar), fishing and buying
from vendors.  There are also a very few places where you can find
something on the ground (e.g. mushrooms in Innothule Swamp, some
vegetables in Rivervale).  But mostly, especially at higher levels,
ingredients come from killing monsters and taking their stuff.

The same thing goes for quests - you almost always need to kill
something to get what you need for the quest, though again there are
some exceptions.
