Well, I don't think a logical argument in a game based on
magic is necessarily persuasive... :D

More to the point:  tradeskilling *supposedly* offers the same
advancement as combat.   Greens should be quicker than
high-blues, etc.   Needing to spend 1/2 a power bar on a
level 3 encounter at level 14 doesn't equate well with the
combat system where that level 3 encounter is a one-cast,
~5% power bar success.   *shrug*
