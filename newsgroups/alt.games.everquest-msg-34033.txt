If a mob is of a much lower level than you, it may still scowl but it
will restrain its aggression (to take it out afterwards on the wife and
children, probably). Some other mobs, like Sabertooths and Crag Spiders
will also /con as Scowling, but they are not aggressive.

Oh, one last point... Mobs of a much lower level than you that won't
normally dare to attack you, will jump down your throat as soon as you
sit down for whatever reason. Worth keeping in mind in dungeons.
