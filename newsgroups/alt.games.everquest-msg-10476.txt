you must first have a spirit tome...
create a female human caster in Freeport with a cutsy name like "sugarcakes" or
something...
give your spirit tome to this new char...
go to EC tunnel and auction your tome...
you then get a buyer...
you put tome in trade window, buyer puts in his money and he hits trade...
you hit cancel and walk away...send a few tells saying "thanks!"  "Have fun!"
buyer sends you a tell that you have hit cancel.
you pretend that it was an accident...
put tome of order and discord in trade window...
hopefully, buyer puts money up and hits trade without realizing it is not a
spirit tome...
It's best to have a friend or another account so you can run and transfer the
spirit tome and money to them, camp and delete character...
rinse, repeat


I have not done this myself, however a friend told me about it...Obviously this
will work with lots of items, but is easy with tomes because new characters
come with them...
