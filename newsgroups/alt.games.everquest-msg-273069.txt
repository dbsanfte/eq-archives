It is so much fun with the 16hr downtimes to fix server code that is
beyond repair, with lag so bad and getting worse that Slashdot covered
it (and Penny Arcade revoked its GOTY award to WoW), with server login
queues that are typically 30mins long, but can be over an hour that you
get more fun out of trying to troll a newsgroup with how much fun the
broken game is.

How do I sign up?
