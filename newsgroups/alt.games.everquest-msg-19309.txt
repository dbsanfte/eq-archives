No, it is level 5 or below.  At level 6 you can PK and be PKed.

>2) You can only pk chars that's less than 4 lvl above or below you

No, anyone level 6 and above can PK anyone else level 6 and above that
is not on the same team.  If the person that kills you is not within 5
levels of you, you will not lose XP for being killed.

>3) evil, good and neutral are all subject to pk to each other.

Right.

So far, from what I've seen in the couple of hours I've played there,
and from what people who've played longer have told me, do NOT go
there if you don't want to PK or be PK'ed.  People are taking the PvP
seriously, and defending their team's territory against the other
teams.

It's turning out quite exciting.  It will be very interesting when
people are higher level, and have to do quests that involve mobs or
NPCs deep in another team's territory.
