What skills aren't you learning.  You are a melee class.  Your melee
skills check dex for skill ups not wis/int.  Besides it's not your int
for trade skills, it's the higher of your int/wisdom.  the barbarian is
not a bad rogue at all, and i don't understand why some many people put
them down.

AGAIN it's the higher or your INT/WIS for skill ups.  Most rogue races
in the game have higher wisdom than int anyways.  Get the Testament of
Vaneer, and get a 10 wis boost, get some plat jasper rings for 6 more
wis each.  you can leave the stuff in the bank and pull it out when your
working on tradeskills/poison.
