Since virtually all Israel does is terrorism then virtually
nothing they do is justified.

Since the Israelis support terrorism, indeed they are one
of only two nations who refused to condem state terrorism,
any clam that they hold any high ground is nonsensical.

Is a taxi a military vehicle, is an ambulance?

Blowing up ambulances and killing doctors and paramedics is a
war crime. The Israelis do this frequently.

Problem is that those are the US and Israel.
