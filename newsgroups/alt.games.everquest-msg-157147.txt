A regular char...about level 3 as well.  Twink powerlevel, probably
20-something but I don't think they count.

I think it was Bizbee who claimed over 3 years ago that his char had never
died, and he was over level 10.  I'm pretty sure I politely told him
"bullshit." :)  It might have been some other a.g.e regular though.
