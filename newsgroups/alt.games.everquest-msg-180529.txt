The only people qualified are the execs at Sony who know exactly how
much time and resources are spent testing. Sorry, but as a player you
simply don't have access to the information. Your "impressions" or
"beliefs" based on your playing time are irrelevant.

Time to work on reading comprehension skills. I never said the bugs do
not matter, nor did I say that they tested adaquately. The continued
success of EQ is a clear indication that neither issue matters enough
to make people quit (which is all that matters). If people were
quitting enmass due to lack of testing and the bugs associated (and
the facts show that they are not), then you could make a case against
Sony's practices.

OK, now I see that you are just another anti-Sony/Verant troll. 

If they didn't care, and neglected the game as you suggest it would
have died within months of launch. If you had even the smallest clue
about the challenges involved in deploying software across a user base
as large as EQ, you would not make such ridiculous comments. Of course
they "have to give a f#$%". If people qui,t the game loses money. If
they game loses money, they will be out of a job.

>Why is there no doubt that they have paid testers?  What evidence do you
>have of this?

Where is your evidence that they do not? Don't respond with a laundry
list of previous bugs. The existence of such bugs does nothing to
prove that Sony has no "paid testers".

The programmers themselves are "paid testers". You don't write/change
code and then ship it without testing. Testing is part and parcel to
the job.

>every patch. You are telling me that they do have paid testers, but
>these people just dont test this stuff?

Where is your proof that they do not test? There must be literally
hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of lines of code in EQ. The
game simply would not work if they did no testing. While it may be
true that they do not test every change, only a fool would believe
that they don't test anything.

>What do you think they are testing?

As much as they can with the resources they have on hand.

>As for the money thing, give me a

Wrong again.

400K+ (at $13 a pop) keep playing/paying each month despite the "bugs"
and other problems you find so upsetting. Love it or hate it the
testing/debugging system they have in place now works (or rather works
well enough that no changes are required). 

It has nothing to do with affording more testing or making less money.
You can cry and whine about it all you want, but as long as players
keep playing there is no reason for Sony to change.

The product works and has "outsold" the competition for 4 years now.
That is an incredible achievement for a computer based software
product. It doesn't matter whether or not you "believe" that they are
doing their best to supply a working product. The facts speak for
themselves.
