While hunting Mountain Brownies is Steamfront and almost always finding them
under the surface, I tried a test.  My Ranger has a lvl 15 Targeted AE spell
called Invoke Lightning.  This spell zaps the target and any mobs close to
it.  So I made the target ME.  I got hit with 11-25 HP and so did the
Mountain Brownie, which then either jumped out and started attacking me or
running depending on the DMG.  Now I could target and finished them.  This
doesn't always work as some mobs seem to be deeper than others but I have no
problems with Spiderlings, brownies and even the occasional Mammoth in
Everfrost.

Good Hunting
