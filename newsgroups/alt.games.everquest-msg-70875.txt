It's easier in that you don't HAVE to go back to your body if you don't want
to. So, if you keel over in a spot that you know will lead to more deaths,
you just don't go back. Now, it does hurt your bank account something
fierce. I like EQs death penalty because normally, I don't die in spots I
can't possibly get to again and that means I get to keep my money. :)
