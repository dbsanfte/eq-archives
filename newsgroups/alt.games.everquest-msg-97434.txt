From a post on www.magecompendium.com -

On test the first practical rollout of the spell caster Focus items is 
underway and they are all summoned no_rent mage items. Its worth noting 
that these are NOT the only focus items, but for all intents and purposes 
these will be the easiest to obtain for quite some time until they add in 
better ones to existing drop-tables.

Starting at level 4 and every spell level after that a Mage can summon: 

Choker 4, 24, 50 
Mantle 8, 29, 51 
Bauble (range) 12, 34, 52 
Ring 16, 39, 53 
Bracer 20, 44, 54 

These have lesser, normal, and greater effect versions of : 

Conservation (mana cost reduction?) 
Diuturnity (spell duration) 
Destruction (nuking damage) 
Pernicity (spell casting haste) 
Abatement (lower aggro?)

After being given something *VERY* useful, the mage 
community is reacting true to form by whining that

"Oh, it's just on test, that won't be how people
get them on live servers!"

"Within a month there will be mob dropped ones that
make these worthless."

"Raid leaders will just have you summon these, then
you go back to being a Mod/Trans rod whore"

etc, etc, ad - fucking - nauseum.  I *REALLY* like
my mage, but there are some elements of the  mage 
community who should just *STOP* playing mages, they
give us all a bad name.
