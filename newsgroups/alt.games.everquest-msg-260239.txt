There's no reason to nerf swarm kiting as it's not that good exp, and it
doesn't create the kind of server load AE kiting has. It might be the best
solo exp, post AE kite nerf, at lower levels (note that the might means I'm
not sure if it's actually the case) but at 65 it's not as good as other
solo classes nor as good as chant kiting in Fire or KT. I can't even remember
last time I swarm kited.
