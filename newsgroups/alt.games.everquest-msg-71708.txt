I click on the "Check store availability" link under the picture of
the game, after entering the zip code in the box for zip code, and
selecting the distance from the drop down list.  It gives a list of
the stores within that distance, and tells how many copies they have
in stock, and whether more are on the way.

Well, it does if you catch it in a good mood, anyway.  Much of the
time, it gives a page that says "Service temporarily unavailable". :-)
