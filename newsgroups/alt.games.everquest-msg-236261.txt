I remember asking in /ooc the exact samething back in October '03.

This bug is fairly common. I can't recall the exact command, but
something like /dopropertint on/off usually fixes it.

My initial installation had this problem; being new to the game I
didn't realize that some players, especially rangers, were not being
displayed correctly. The colors finally corrected themselves when I
upgraded to Evolution; it was a big change to see my stoic, fully
clothed female ranger suddenly Britney-fied.

But from time to time I pine for my ranger when she was a beatnik,
showing no skin and wearing a turtleneck :)
