Naw.  Annie posted just about exactly what I was thinking I might get 
around to posting.  And I'm male.  But since she posted it, I won't bother.

Thanks Annie! :)

Oh, except I would've also backed the idea that she could quite easily have 
been a he.  And that her husband could quite easily have been her.  Or 
him.  Of course, I base that on having roleplayed an entire family of 
gnomes for quite some time.  Never bothered to back it with fake photos 
and emails, but I know of many who have...

}Listen up Lonely Guy and for those that want to save your life from the
}clutches of EQ:

Oh, quit trolling.
