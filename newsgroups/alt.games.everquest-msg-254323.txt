    Have you seen the new twist in last names? Now that you can change your
last name once per week, people have been experimenting with what is
possible. Remember how you can edit your .ini file to put non-ASCII
characters into a hotkey? Well, make a hotkey for the /surname command, then
go to work on a last name. I've seen a lot of Greek characters in last
names, and the empty box character being used to make spaces. So, for
example, one person I know is now Soandso King(box)Of(box)Felwithe. From far
away you cannot see the boxes clearly, so it shows simply as Soandso King Of
Felwithe. He had a lot of lower-level players asking how one could become
king - insert Monty Python jokes here.

    I used to be very hardline on naming violations, but I saw something
recently that made me soften my stance. I saw someone named something like
"Miketheking", and was getting ready to report it, when I saw his
adventuring companion was "Uberdad". Seeing a father take the time to game
with his son got me all verklempt, and I let it pass.
