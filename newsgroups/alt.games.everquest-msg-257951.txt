I heard a rumor recently that there's a cap to hp regen.

I'm trying to determine what, if any, cap exists, and how it works.

My current standing hp regen is 41 per tic, sitting starts at 43 per tic 
and grows as I sit longer.

15 points of that is off a self buff which is overwritten by standard 
regen buffs; that means my normal standing regen per race/class/level 
plus my item regen is 26.  I took off the buff and confirmed that that 
was indeed my standing regen.

Then I took off a +1 regen item, and my regen dropped to 25.  Put the 
buff back on and my rate went up to 40.  I'm pretty sure this means I'm 
not yet at the cap, if any.

If there -is- a cap, question is what thing or set of things or sets of 
things are capped, and at what?

For example, does buff regen ever count towards the cap?

How about AA based regen?

How about racial regen (not that I can change races, nor that barbarians 
get anything out of the ordinary as far as regen goes)

Bardsong regen?

Various regenning buffs which don't have stacking issues with normal 
buff regen line?

I think I know the answer, which is that racial, level, AA, and item 
regen all add together to form a base regen rate, and if there's any cap 
it applies only to that.  All other forms of regen are limited simply by 
buff slot conflict; there's literally only so much you can get, but 
whatever you manage to get to stick at the same time all counts.

If I'm right, then I've already determined my current base regen (26) 
and all I need to know is what, if any, my limit is, and whether it 
rises as I level up.
