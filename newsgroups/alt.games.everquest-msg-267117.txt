Yes i most certainly do. That may be the piece of the puzzle many of you 
fine socialists miss.  Lets see work in sweatshop on chair 8 hrs for 5 bucks 
a day. Or go collect dung in fields at 50 cents for the day. This is the 
choice many 3rd world people have. You tell them they can not work at the 
sweatshop because it harms your sensibility and the poor people sit down and 
cry rivers. There is a bloody reason a mcdonalds opens in russia, india, or 
even iraq and they have 12000 applicants who desperately want that dollar an 
hour job. Comfy americans just can not comprehend how most of the world 
lives and historically how all humans have lived. We clawed our way out with 
capitalism and now are biting the hand that fed us.

Any 2 parties should be allowed to enter into willing trade. Goverments only 
purpose is to insure that no unwilling trade goes on. You cannot use force 
or fraud to limit anyone elses life, liberty, or property and thats the only 
rule we need.
