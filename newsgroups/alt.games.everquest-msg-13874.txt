First off, the same thing happened to me and since when it happened to me it
WAS my fault, I'm willing to bet a few plat that it was YOUR fault you got
stuck in there.

Bet ya forgot to patch for the zone, didn't you?

Secondly, it sounds like you copped a seriously bad attitude towards the
guide/gm...at least, if your attitude towards them is anything like the
attitude showed in your post I wouldn't have blamed him at all for sticking
you back in there.
