Downtime and dps are 2 different things. With enchanter and bard you wont
have any downtime, but I dont see a lot of dps. Pretty much all the SK and
BL (unless chanter has DC, or bard starts charming stuff). Druid is a total
waste of time in that group (SK can snare), unless you need sow/evacs. (Bard
can do sow with selo chorus)
