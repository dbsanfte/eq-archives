I don't know about the Erudin quests, but I know from experience with
other race's newbie armor quests that some of the drops are *VERY*
rare. (Pulling my hair out trying to find the right calcified drops
for my DESK's...) Check allakhazam's and see if the quests have been
solved and submitted there already... Might be an issue of the items
just being really rare.
