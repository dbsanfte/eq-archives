They are used to make Acorn Oil (using the Brewing skill), which in
turn is used in tailoring halfling cultural armor.

A fair price is a tough call. It's not as though getting them requires
any effort - they're random ground spawn. That would indicate a low
price, maybe a plat each.

On the other hand, though, the people who are high enough tailoring
skill level to be attempting that kind of armor are probably too high
to find running around Misty Thicket looking for them rewarding. Add
to that the fact they're slightly rare, and you start to get into a
higher price range - pushing the 10 plat mark.

When I'm buying them I never pay more than 5 plat each. If the seller
wants more, he's welcome to find another buyer, and I'll come around
looking some other time.
