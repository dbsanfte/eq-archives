    It really depends on the zone, and what mobs are there. In Butcherblock,
you fly through level one, two, and three with the abundant level 1 spawns
that are all non-aggro. But to clear level 4 usually involves some bone chip
questing, since there aren't many level 2 mobs near Kaladim. Go to Field of
Bone, and you're swarmed by level 2 mobs every time you start a fight (I
think my record was 12 scaled wolf pups in a row), so you go very slowly
through levels one and two, and fly through three and four.
