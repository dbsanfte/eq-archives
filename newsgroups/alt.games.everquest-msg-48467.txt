This is a great quest.  Pay Moodoo 4 gold until you get a jester card,  turn
that in for page 34.  It just has one little problem getting page 30.  To do
that you need to kill Dyllin Starshine who hangs out with the smugglers in
Highhold pass.  Kill him and you get page 30.   Oh and did i mention that
Dylin is on a 6-10 hour spawn and always is camped?  Good luck,  i've wasted
away many an hour waiting for him to pop.
