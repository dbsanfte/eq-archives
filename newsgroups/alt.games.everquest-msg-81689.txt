For this reason alone it should have it's own Nexus pad and a Scion
spouting "dire warnings" to travellers. It would have made more sense
combining the Velious(GD) and Kunark (DreadLands) Nexus pads.

/agree partially

That one time could be a very painful and long corpse recovery. We all
know it is going to happen to someone who didn't read the patch
message, and didn't pay attention in the Nexus (foreign language
player perhaps?). In some respects such a person bears a
responsibility to what happens to them, but you have to admit that
combining pads will lead to these kinds of issues

I knew what I was doing, but with OOC, Shout, group chat, Guild chat,
and about 12 people chain hailing the Scions it was easy to miss the
messages in all the spam.

I think we can agree on most points. I just think it was short-sighted
on Verants part to not include a pad for Velious in the first place,
and then compound the issue by combing the Velious pad with the Odus
one.

Respecfully,

Val
