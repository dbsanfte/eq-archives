    Yeah, I know - I wasn't horribly impressed at first either. But he has
been making an effort to get his new auto-follow buddy some better gear, XP
him up a little, and learn some strategy so he can raid with him. The way he
wants to raid with him is kinda neat, too. Dachunker is the first person to
know when he needs healing, so he uses the bot to cast those early quick
heals to keep himself alive until real heals start landing.
