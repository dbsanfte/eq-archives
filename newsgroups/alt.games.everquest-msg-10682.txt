I suppose you *could* look at it that, TH, but man that seems like a
stretch. The interviewee was given a choice of comparing them, in terms
of soloabiltiy to a necro or a druid. His response of, "I wouldn't
compare them to a druid..." really seems to say it all. I read in that a
definite undertone of, "Oh no! They aren't *that* soloable.... more like
a shadowknight."  If that is the case, and you wanted to emphasize that
the beastmaster wasn't some super soloable class, would you pick the
second most soloable of the two choices to make that distinction, or the
most? Seems pretty obvious to me. But since you find it "interesting"
that I would read it that way, then there's obviously room or two
opinions on it.
