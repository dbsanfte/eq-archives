Lol "infect"?

Apple based OSX on BSD, which meant they had to abide by the BSD 
license. The BSD license only requires that you acknowledge their work 
when you compile/distribute their software. It does not require you to 
keep it open source.

The windows FTP client is from BSD. Have a look at the binaries and you 
will see a reference to BSD in there.
