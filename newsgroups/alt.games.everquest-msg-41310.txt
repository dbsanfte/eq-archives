> What quest?

There's a ranger NPC who stands outside emerald warriors in Kelethin.  You
say a phrase to him, he hands you a pack in which you place 4 pieces of
shark meat.  Combine the pack, and give him the resulting pack, and he gives
you exp, money, and a bronze weapon.  You could also do this from inside the
shop, right next to a vendor, so you never even had to move to sell the
bronze weapons.  The trick was, Mordin's meats in Thurgadin sold unlimited
shark meat.  One haul of 8 backpacks got me one or two yellows at level 23
on my druid (I don't recall exactly, but I dinged a few times doing this
quest).  I would bind in Thurgadin, load up my inventory AND bank with
backpacks full of shark meat, port to BB, and make the short run to
Kelethin.  They shortly removed the shark meat from the vendor, but it was
fun while it lasted.  I was a twink at level 23 (my first EQ character ever)
:)
