I'll add that I'm aware of the fog problem on an nvidia 5200FX, and an 
ati 9800 pro setup, (and a ti4600).

The only thing that's remotely interesting about all these "non-directX 
9 cards having problems with fog" is that despite not supporting 
directX9 they are having the same problems as the directx9 ones.

ergo, once again, directx9 hardware support in your video card is not 
the holy grail for EQ, and if you happen to have a ti4600 or ti4800 your 
probably well advised to hold out until the very latest cards come down 
a bit more in price before you'll get any -real- value out of an 
upgrade.
