   True, dat.  And make no mistake, I've met several
druids that have considerably enhanced my EQ fun, 
and not just by porting me around (actually, I 
very rarely get ported anywheres, I don't mind 
taking the boat).  As I've said, after flipping
through the gamebook which decries the class, 
I picked druid too, as my very first class.  Its
a great class, from what I've heard, up into the 
very high end game, which many, including myself,
will probably never reach.
   So what's the problem?  Well, for me its a
combination of several things.  Too many people
looking for the same druid friendly drops or
great hunting grounds.  A general blandness 
of being "one of the crowd".  Being a member
of a class the many newbie choose, and keep,
because its it so powerful for so many levels,
that they don't have to learn, or care about,
the intricacies of other classes.  There are
jerks playing every single class of EQ.  But
many jerks gravitate to the early "fix" of being
a powerful druid at an early level.
   Druid bashing is easy, and that's not what
I'm trying to do here.  I'm just pointing
out that aside from the very obvious pros
to being a druid, there are subtle, but 
to me anyways, profound reasons NOT to play
one as well.

            on "wanted dead" posters on all
            the druid guilds walls for this.
