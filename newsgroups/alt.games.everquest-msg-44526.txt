A level 40 monk makes 30Kpp by getting their alt up to level 60
and selling their loot to twink their monk.

-IF- you did anything at all that would net you that kind of money,
it would still be almost impossible not for you to accidentally level
up to at least 45 while doing so.  I suppose it would be possible
for you to do it killing greens if you really wanted to, but greens
that drop any sort of cash that wouldn't take you a real life year
to generate that level of wealth?  I can't think of any.

Hmm, another possibility is that the monk dedicated the time to
become a grand master tailor, say, and made cobalt drake armor
to sell.  I know my first cleric was a 186 smith, and could
get a couple Kpp for a full suit of FS plate back in the day,
(about 1Kpp in profit) so making 30 full suits, could I have
found customers and dedicated the time, would have bought
that tunic.

If you are going to trade skill, though, again the reccomendation
would be to do so with an alt, so you can max out wis/int.  Most
trade skills, a level 1 (well, level 6 so an unfortunate death doesn't
wipe you out due to the short body evaporation time) alt can
do as well as a level 60.
