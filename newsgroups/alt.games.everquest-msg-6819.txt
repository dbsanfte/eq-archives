If today is patch day (I'm traveling, and can't run EQ on this POS
laptop), it's likely that the servers still haven't been brought up to
date with the same version that you received in the patch. In other
words, the patch day is still underway.

Just kick back and try again in a few hours. That's almost always the
correct solution for EQ server problems, anyway :)
