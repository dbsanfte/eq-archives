| I have Tab set up as 'Target yourself' and f1 set up as
| 'cycle through nearest mobs'.

Personally I use the [~] key for target nearest so that [F1] remains
as target self and F2 ++ is target group members; and [Tab] remains
the default cycle-last-2-targets.

For BOB (the original poster) I think we should mention that the
target nearest mob tends to be more "target closest mob that happens
to be in the middle of the screen or near it if the client feels like
it" .... lol ... It takes a little practice to use once you get it
setup, and make sure you are in the habbit of CHECKING the target
before attacking... it's all to easy to target a friendly with it.
