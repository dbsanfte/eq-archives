Pauludal (sp?) Caverns is the best EXP in the game 5-27. The zone is
located off of Shadowhaven (Nexus->Bazaar->ShadowHaven), so it is
trivial to get to if you have the expansion. Check out www.eqatlas.com
for maps and details.

Lag (more specifically video lag) in Luclin is determined mostly by
your system specs. Post your hardware specs, and the group should be
able to give you a good idea as to what to expect.

The Bazaar is a nightmare for everyone. Plan on staring at a wall or
the floor in order to have a decent enough framerate to click around
in the interface.
