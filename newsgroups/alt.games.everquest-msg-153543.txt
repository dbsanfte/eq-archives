Excuse me for expressing my opinion and my voice. I pay a monthly fee
just like everyone else, and I am entitled to make my concerns vocal.

The fact that you so vehemently defended Blizzard back during the
Diablo 2 fiasco (read: technical UNsupport) shows that you're willing
to blindly follow nearly anyone.

Strike out on your own, make your own voice vocal. You don't have to
get a hardon and agree with every single thing done by the developers,
especially when they are intentional mistakes.
