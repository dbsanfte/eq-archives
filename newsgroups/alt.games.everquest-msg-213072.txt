    Standard UI, I crashed last night when I hit "Update" on the Bazaar
window. I had performed this operation successfully prior to the crash. I
wrote it off to the usual post-patch bugginess, and assumed it wasn't going
to be a long-term bug. I didn't try it again after I logged in.

    Anyone know what tonight's patch is supposed to fix?
