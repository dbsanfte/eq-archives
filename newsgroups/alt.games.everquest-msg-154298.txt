Not pricing something will make it unavailable for sale, even in a
trader bag.  Well, either that or people are stupid enough not to buy
the '0pp' items off of me ;p.  OTOH you have caught a 'maybe' reason
for his doing this - don't want to eat all the MTPs you're trying to
sell?  Throw in 2 stacks of fish rolls in slots above the MTPs and
price them at 999,999pp.  Ditto Fizzlethorp's drinks if you're selling
stat drinks.
