I know it is a hectic area sometimes, but depending on your
server, splitpaw is always good for that level range.  I play
on prexus and the inside of paw has almost always been
empty when I went there.  As long as you take a group
with you, it's great.

Another idea, though a busier place,would be crystal
caverns.  CC has more people, but the loot is better.

Anywhere you take the groups will be fun. I would
really suggest paw since you can take more than 1 group
and not offend anyone by using OOC or shout to
communicate.

Cheers,
