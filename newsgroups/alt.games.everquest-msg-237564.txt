I have never played Everquest before in my life. A day or two ago I
downloaded the Demo version of "Lords of Everquest". I have enjoyed and
planned to purchase the game. Then someone told me that "Lords of Everquest"
was an expansion pack. Another person told me that "Lords of Everquest" was
a full version but I could not use existing expansion packs with it. I also
noticed that it states that there is no subscription required. This also
confuses me because I have always been told that you have to pay for a
subscription to play the game. So here are my questions. Is "Lords of
Everquest "a full version and if so is it compatible with other Everquest
games and expansion packs? Any assistance would be appreciated.

Thanks
Rodney
