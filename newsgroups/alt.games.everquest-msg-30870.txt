   This happens alot and to lots of people. Especially when the servers
become overloaded at 2k plus inhabitants. What I find works best for me,
that you might try, is just to reboot. This clears the memory on my end and
also allows enough time for my toon to time out on their end so I can log in
again with it. Best of luck.
