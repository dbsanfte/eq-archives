Banded Armour (the player made stuff) is all the same... there's no price
difference for small, medium or large. Just to be on the safe side, tho...
buy a set your SK would wear (medium) and if it's not as good as the stuff
you're already wearing, just dump it in the bank until you need it for the
Scale quests.
