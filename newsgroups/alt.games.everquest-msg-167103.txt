Needleites in Echo Caverns.  Darkness/Tap/Leech them.  Keep your damage
shield and FD up at all times.  You only need ST on the linked pair (far
side of cave and to the right from entrance pairs with central spawn loc).
The Queen spawns in the center of the room.  All drop wings and legs which
sell for 2+ pp ea to vendors and they stack.  Queen drops either a Giant
Wing (back armor) or a stinger (dagger).

Search google for Echo Caverns Needleite (I think that's the spelling) for a
better guide to the room.
