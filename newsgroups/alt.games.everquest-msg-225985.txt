    Cheaper than Solstice? God, no. The only other item that provides mana
that you'll find for cheap is a horse. Everything else, even the stupid
little ranged item that gives FT 1 and maybe 2 WIS/INT, is going to cost you
25 K+. The only reason the Solstice Earring can be obtained cheaply is
because many of the items required for it are skill paths for a given
tradeskill, so they're dumped by the ton in the Bazaar and sell for near
cost. The pieces that aren't skill paths, like the fishing rod and the idol,
are the expensive parts and are priced at a premium. In my server's Bazaar,
there's people that sell complete kits for 5 K or so. Unless you know what
you're doing, that's likely the best bet.
