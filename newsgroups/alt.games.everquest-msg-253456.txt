Heh, he -wanted- to group, very much.  We weren't particularly interested 
in having him, but figured it couldn't hurt.  You are dead right that we 
should have explained loot rules up front.

Our only problems with that would have been, (a) it's not the system we'd 
been using, and (b) then we have to stop and dicker about loot.  It's just 
been easier, given that our group is generally one plate class, one silk 
class, one leather class, and between zero and two chain classes, to let 
the drop roll for us.  Plus, that guarantees that if by some odd chance 
the piece -is- an upgrade, the right person has it.

Well, that's more or less the point.  We -didn't- want to bring some 
unknown person into our group.  But we didn't want to listen to him sit at 
the zoneline whining about how rude we were for not grouping him, either.
We chose what looked like the easy course, and it was messy.  *Shrug*  
Next time, we'll know better.

>>Of course, our system had 3-4 rolls to his one, so odds were in my favor 
>>anyway, heh. 
>Pretty much :>.

The part being overlooked, here, is that our system may well have favored 
random_shammy_01, too.  If by some odd chance chain -had- dropped, he'd 
have had one person to roll against, max.  And knowing Toadwort, the 
rogue, if he'd said 'ooh, that's an upgrade over my Armor of Crappy 
Veliousness', Toad probably woulda passed.

Aye, and that's more or less exactly why I decided to open it to a roll 
when it became an issue.  But annoyingly, I'm gonna twink with them 
instead, and remain poor.  My wizard will be a happy camper when she hits 
60 and the focus effect actually does something though. :)
