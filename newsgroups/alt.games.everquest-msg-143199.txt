Don't sweat it. You did nothing wrong. Sure you could have made your
life easier, but that doesn't mean you were rude or greedy.

As the seller you have control. It is up to the buyer to meet your
price, or beat any offers made by other buyers. Both buyers willingly
engaged in a bidding war. Either one could have made a final "take it
or leave it" offer to save themselves time. If the guy was in such a
rush to get his wife to work, he should have made you an offer you
couldn't refuse (even then it would be a risk to wait for him to come
back when you had another buyer ready and willing to meet your price).
Both decided to haggle, and at that point both should have been
prepared to lose. 

If the buyer walks away (even if he/she says he will return), they are
out of the running. The guy logged off "for 15mins". What if he never
came back or got tied up in RL? Then you would have had no sale and
two people miffed at you. 

Besides you're a cleric. If the guy is smart, he will do his best to
NOT get on your bad side. :-) The next time he needs a res, he will be
your best friend again.

Your reputation is not decided by one incident like the one you
described.

PS Don't put two bidders on the same channel if you can help it. You
have more control if you keep their offers hidden from each other. If
they want to exchange tells between each other that is thier business.
