Ok SoL is suppose to have Horses. Ok here is my questions for any Beta
testers.

 #1 Which is faster a Horse or running with Sow?

 #2 Can a Horse be Sowed?

 #3  When on a Horse are you standing or sitting being that you can fight
from a Horse I assume you are standing can casters cast spells from a
horseback?

 #4 Do you have to buy and carry feed for your Horse, and can Horses carry
any gear?
