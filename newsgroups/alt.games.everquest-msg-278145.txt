That is why I found it annoying. With all the spell level 
changes to under 50 spells, and no current up to date spell 
lists by their new levels, you have to look at the details 
of almost every spell. They also seem to have messed up the 
spells on a few vendors. I have seen Druid only spells on a 
Ranger spell merchant.

I would have liked to see the spell level rather than the 
prices. If you need a spell, you need the spell. If you 
don't have enough plat on your char, you still have to visit 
the bank. Showing the prices means little or nothing to me. 
If I need something for tradeskilling from a merchant, I buy 
it. I couldn't be bothered running around to see if another 
merchant has it slightly cheaper. In most cases, weapons on 
merchants are so overpriced that I skip over them anyways. 
In 5 years I think I have come across about 3 "deals" on 
merchant purchased weapons. The scrolling while holding the 
alt key presents no difficulties to me. I've never had a 
problem identifying which box the popup names apply to.

I agree with the sorting, I do like that. But, from a narrow 
point of view as you've mentioned, and with an abundance of 
casters in my stable, a sort function based on spell levels 
would be very nice addition indeed!

I may come to like it in time, and when the various spell 
lists get sorted out, as they certainly will, but for now it 
is really slowing down that part of the game for me.
