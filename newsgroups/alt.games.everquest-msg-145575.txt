Like I always say, there's not the tiniest difference between
getting your kicks acting like an asshole online, and
actually *being* an asshole.

The same goes for those who think to themselves, "I'm not
really a sociopath, I just play one online" -- I'd be willing
to bet their wives, children, friends, and neighbors might
not agree.  People who enjoy inflicting misery can't just
turn it off when they step away from the keyboard.
