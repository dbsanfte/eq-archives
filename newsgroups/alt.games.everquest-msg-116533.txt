Probably an excerpt from the ESPN article which ran around that time.
Schilling was around level 5 or 6, as was a friend of his on another team.
The friend of his was one of only three people to (if I remember correctly)
hit two home runs off Schilling in one game, and upon being asked how he
accomplished this awesome feat (the other two people were people who are top
hitters, like Mark McGuire), the friend said he was mad because Schilling
got his EQ character killed.

The way the friend told it, they were hunting Aviaks, and Schilling
basically was a coward who ran off to the guards when things got a little
risky, leaving his friend to die.  Schilling told a different tale of that
event, of course. :-)
