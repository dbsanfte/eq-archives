Then you can rest easy, he doesn't.

For the sake of argument, I'll ignore (somewhat) the fact that your numbers
appear to be made up from thin air.  You claim a warrior gets a 40 percent
damage boost from Aggressive.  (Of course, of the two of us, I'm the only
one that has seen aggressive in action, and it sure as hell doesn't look
like 40 percent to me.)  You further claim that this extra "40 percent" is
enough to allow the warrior to outdamage the monk.

Ignoring all that for a moment...  Aggressive lasts for 3 minutes.  (and
cannot be cancelled early, so if you get aggro or have to tank, you'll be
getting hit like a post-nerf monk would).  Aggessive has a recharge time of
30 minutes.

The warrior can be aggressive, and do damage "like a monk" for 10% of the
time.

The other NINETY PERCENT of the time, the monk does much more damage than
the second warrior.

If your warrior is getting to use aggressive in every fight, find a better
group.   I don't care what you're hunting, one kill per 30 minutes is
pathetic experience.
