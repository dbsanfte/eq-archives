ZoneAlarm does not appear to have that option unless it's the Pro version
unless I'm mistaken or there's been a recent update. However there is
another workaround for non Pro users that works fine for me. Before
launching EQ, go to Program Control in Zone Alarm, move the slider to "low"
( learning mode ), then run EQ as normal. Once you are in the game you can
alt tab out and ramp it back up to medium again as it will have "learnt" the
new changes to the exe.

It's a pity EQ has always had the problem that when it is unable to send /
receive data on login etc it appears to cease responding for a fairly
extended period of time and cause a few issues with selecting the Zonealarm
dialog if you're running in fullscreen mode, that sort of thing. However I
find this works ok, and as long as I remember to do this on patch day it's
plain sailing. Sounds like Pro is a bit more useful in this respect.
