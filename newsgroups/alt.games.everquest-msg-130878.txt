All too true.  Yet this is only EQs way of dealing with the fact
that a few days (hours!) after a new quest goes live, the complete
details are published on the web for all to read.  IMNSHO, it just
ain't a quest if all the steps are laid out for you in advance.

Until it is possible to randomize all quests, quest npcs, items
and rewards (huge programming nightmare) this will be standard for
any good MMORPG.  I played DAoC for 3 months and found the newbie
quests to be ridiculously easy with every step written out in the
quest journal.  At level 15 they start becoming more mysterious,
but then these quests suffer from the same problem as EQs.  The
details are published where everybody can read them.  Some players,
of course, will demand just this sort of style.  They like being
able to get the same "uberitem_01" that their friends/rivals have,
and having the quest steps known in advance.  The designers have a
tough job trying to please everybody.  How does AO handle this?

I think quests *should* be difficult and a feeling of great
elation should follow successful completion.  I don't like EQs
methods:  the extremely rare spawn that takes days of camping;
or the common spawn that rarely drops the required item.  But
I haven't yet seen any viable alternative.  I do however, look
forward to seeing how future online RPGs will approach this
problem.
