Pulling back to my pet is no problem.  I can nuke from a distance
and run back to my pet without getting touched.

The hard part is single pulling.  Mages don't have any special
skills, abilities, or spells to help them single pull.  Which
seems almost essential when soloing (unless you're quadding).

And, of course, adds are a BIG problem.

Pets summon at max level now?  I didn't know that.  When did
that happen?

Resummoning after zoning is pretty tedious.  So is summoning
all the gear you intend to play with.  It's nice to be less
gear dependent, but mages definately pay for it with a long
session of summoning every time they login!

Speaking of Gate...it just saved my life.  I tried to single
pull a shadowed man, but three came.  One attacked my pet
and two attacked me.  Fortunately, Gate finally went off on
my 3rd or 4th cast.  Whew!

Unfortunately, I didn't feel like running back where I was,
and resummoning my pet, weapons, armor, and buffs, so here I
am on Usenet instead.  Heh.

By the way, I don't want anyone to get the impression I think
mages are too weak.  I don't think that.  I'm just pointing out
some of the more tedious parts of them (as there probably are
with any class), and also pointing out they aren't really the
soloing gods people think they are.  Toe to toe with any SINGLE
mob, they're quite good.  But that's about it.
