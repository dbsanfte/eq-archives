Hail and well met, all!

My Barbie roguette wants a change scenery as High Hold (at Kithicor
entrance) is either a) empty or b) camped with a full group complete with
waiting list.

Might any of you experienced players have any suggestions as to where she
should point her weapons to find a combination of good grouping potential,
decent xp and loot, please?

Oh, and another question if I may, is my pickpocket skill vital to the
completion of some latter quests or something?  I`ve yet to move beyond the
single point I put in this skill at my guild as I have serious misgivings
about depriving my team mates of any of their share of loot. Maybe because
any player can use the same skill, I feel more comfortable using my begging
skill on mobs.  Are the rewards for begging worse, equal or better than
those of picking a mob`s pockets?

Is there such a thing as a (cough) honest thief or are my moral qualms to be
cast aside?

Dwadfey
