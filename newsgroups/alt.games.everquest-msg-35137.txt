THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was driving me totally *batty* last night! Getting ready for an upcoming
raid, a group of us were in ToFS getting more keys and were working the
library. Inbetween librarian and teacher spawns, I was pulling scholars, etc.
from the right hand row. I kept getting a message "a skeletal hand hits you
for....."  and I hadn't even aggroed anything yet.  I was going nuts looking
around for a skeletal hand similar to the reanimated hand in Unrest.
