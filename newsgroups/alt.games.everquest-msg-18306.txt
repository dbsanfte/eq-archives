Speaking of which, I think it would be interesting if
that were removed, and if /shout and /ooc only extended
as far as an actual shout, and not zone-wide.

Yes, it would make some things much more difficult, but
the RP aspect would go up astronomically.

Imagine having to physically meet somewhere (like a
designated pub in each town) to see who's about to
head out into the wilderness, and find members to join
your adventuring crew.  Imagine your friends heading
off into a dungeon while you stay behind, and you're
unable to learn their fate until they return victorious,
or one comes straggling back naked and bloody, searching
for people to form a rescue party to recover the others.
Etc.
