Str does nothing.  It does not increase your magic number damage, it
does not increase average overall damage.  The best thing str is for
is carrying weight, and this is meaningless to a Monk.

Agility, meanwhile, will grant him AC.  Stamina will grant him hit
points.  Both of which are actually, you know, *useful*.
