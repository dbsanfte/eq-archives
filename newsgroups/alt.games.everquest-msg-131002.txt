I got the "any" earring with a druid friend while we put together her pair, and
while she did the simpler combines, in the end it was several days worth
of harvesting spider silks so she could do the Robe combine over and over
as trade stock and cash source that was the key.  Even though her skill
started out at around 160, so that she was failing 19/20 this still was the
most effective use of our time.  In addition to trade goods, cash for a
couple pairs of Tboots for our alts, and the three robes we kept for our
own earrings, she also saw quite a few skill ups, and I suspect saw them
far cheaper than with more traditional tailoring skill increase venues.  A
skill up where failures cost you 20pp or so, successes cost 300pp but
retail for 5000pp, and all you have to do is farm silks till your poor alts
scream enough?

Hey, we paid the alts in TBoots so they should just hush and go try to
find some silk droppers that are actual exp, now that there's no rush
they won't have to keep working EK.
