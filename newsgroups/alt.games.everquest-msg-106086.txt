Nah, not since the producer said what the stats do. Charisma is only
for vendor prices and bard and chanter mez type spells. My troll sk
with 4 charisma knows that it does not help for fearing. She fears
zero percent better than my cleric who is also around level 39, who
has 85 charisma. Fear is magic resitence.

The best way to tell this is items. If less charisma was better for
necros, guess what all necro gear would have? That's right, minus
charisma. It doesn't. All high end enchanter gear has plus charisma,
especially tov and such armor, yet necro does not have minus charisma.
Boom, there ya go. I in fact used to play a mud where charisma DID
affect fear and the charmies for necros and necros DID have large
minus charisma gear.

Low charisma has zero to do with being a better necro, like anyone
else having it high is the only benefit (charming and vendor prices)

STATS EXPLAINED, APRIL 9, 2000 
Source: Everquest Gameplay Forum.

"...We're posting this for clarification, and because previous
explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not,
however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect
game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking.
Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not
going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after
the game's been out for more than a year. "

"...CHA: affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC merchants,
and how much they will pay you; affects the saving throw on certain
bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular) "
