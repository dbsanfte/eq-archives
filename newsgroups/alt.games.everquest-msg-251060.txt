I am doing okay, I found out how to check. The alt-click mentioned
by Ben.

Servers are Stromm and Zebuxoruk And on Zebuxoruk I found a
chainmail coif/hauberk for around 35 plat. Seems rather expensive...
I've seen it much cheaper in other games, but maybe that price is
more normal in Everquest.

I probably wont be online in Everquest until Thursday night CDT/PDT
time. My job schedule is busy ever other week. I was on about 15
hours last wekend over all 3 days. Thats alot of gaming for me.
