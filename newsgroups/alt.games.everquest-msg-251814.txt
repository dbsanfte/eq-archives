Since my return, I've been vaguely uncomfortable with something not 
seeming to work like I think it does.

Just today, I think I figured out what that is.

I'm standing up against my will, in a way that I don't remember 
happening before.

This morning, I was sitting down thinking about camping, when I decided 
to gate to POK instead.  Now I've spent a great deal of my life on 
drogmarback, so I don't necessarily think "I'm sitting, best stand up", 
like I would have back when I spent most of my life on my butt for the 
meditation benefits.  So I just clicked on the gate icon with my mouse.

Stood up and cast the spell.

Thinking back, I've been getting up at all sorts of odd times, or at 
least so it seems in my memory.

I've been sitting in an LDoN, clicked on my Clay Bracelet (summons Eye 
of Zomm), stood up, cast the spell.  Sit back down, zoomed the eye 
around for a while, when itruns out of steam, suddenly I'm standing up 
and running forward.

I'm pretty sure that if I tried to cast a spell while sitting back 
before I left, nothing happened.  And when my eye ran down, I'd be 
sitting if the body I left behind was sitting; this new way means I have 
to be careful as when it runs out I can get up and go running into aggro 
range of something before I know it.

On the plus side, if this is working, and if it works from commands 
instead of just from clicking, then some macros are going to be a lot 
shorter
