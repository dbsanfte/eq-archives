Grouped here many times and had no troubles mezzing and slowing. Took a
break from exp and went off to do trade skills to bring them up for 5th
shawl and onwards. Back in Velks and I have noticed that the resist to MR is
a lot higher on hunters etc. Cannot slow a hunter at all and the lower
spiders seem to resist that little bit more often. So I think this was
stealthed in on one of the recent patches.

Anyone else notice this?

Any Shamans out there able to slow the hunter class, all those below Shards,
Watchers etc. I can slow.
