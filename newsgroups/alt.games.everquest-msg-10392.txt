There is a point that most of the posters here are missing. Some people do
like to level fast and get nice items quickly for their characters. They are
correct in that almost all the info you could possibly ever want or need is
readily available on the net at castersrealm, allakhazzam's eqlizer et all,
but the fact is that it takes time to actively search for it all. The guys
that sell these guides have probably put quite a substantial amount of time
and effort into gathering all this information together into one location
and in a format which is easily searchable.
It's easy to knock them as money-making scams, but let's be realistic-
that's the point of them- people put them together with the intention of
making a profit!
It all depends on you, and on what you want from the game, that decides
whether or not you buy them. Remember no one actually forces you to buy
them.
If you do decide to go ahead and buy one then first of all see if there's a
good sized sample that you can try for free first.
When you actually part with your money, more than liekly you'll be sent a
URL to a password protected site along with a username and password for
access to the full guide.

Hope that helps you to decide a little more objectively than just slating
them as money-making scams!
