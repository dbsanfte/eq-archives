Years from now, you'll remember places like that, but won't remember where
they were, and that can be annoying.

For example, I've got some neat places I remember being, that were either in
Quake maps I downloaded, or were in the steam tunnels under Caltech.

I've got some memories that are either somewhere in Nektulos in EQ, or a
weekend camping trip my 6th grade class went on about 30 years ago.

There's a snowy forrest I recall that could be winter in the Pacific
Northwest, a level from Medal of Honor, or Yggdra forrest from DAoC.
I remember killing Nazis with my sniper rifle there, so I can deduce
that it was probably from Medal of Honor. :-)

It's going to get worse for me if I ever get a house in real life, because I
think I'll have my house and lot custom designed and landscaped to look just
like my DAoC house and lot.  That should cause some interesting memory
confusion.  :-)
