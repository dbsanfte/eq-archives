Okay...  I have to rant about this, cause I'm getting tired of crap like
this.

Here I am sitting, near Permafrost entrance, working the Ice Giants...  I
get nagged by Green Players to buff them, to heal them, to save them from
mobs.  One person, a Green Rogue/Shaman type Barbarian...  Fairly naked,
first asks out for location of  Permafrost... I'm kind enough to give it
out.  Then the person asks me, once she gets there, for Invis and SoW...  So
I go...  "Why?"

Answer, "So I can get past the goblins."

Now, if I remember correctly, the Ice Goblins inside of Permafrost can see
through Invis, so people can't get around them.

So I tell her this.  She goes, "Well, I wanna see if I can get by them."

At this point, I go, "No."  Her response, /rude and tells me not to be 'a
tigt wad'.

At this point, I have to say...  I am not going to waste mana to buff or
augment a person into an area they are worried about agro, especially if I
am camping Ice Giants.

The next thing is... I don't like being used as a buffing/healing/guard
station to rescue people unless I advertise it.  I have even seen a soloing
rogue approach a grouped Cleric to heal and buff him while on my alt.  When
I solo, I rarely ask for anything unless it is offered, because I know
people are not there for me, they are their for themselves or for their
group members.

This isn't about being a 'tigt wad' like this idiot Barbarian accuses me of,
but priority of things.  I am grinding away at something, on my own time.
Just as anyone is trying to enjoy the game, it does not mean that high level
players are tight wads, or elitest, but we are also not friggin security
blankets for players.

I'm tired of having to bail out players, even newbie ones, in areas they can
see there are heavy duty mobs like the big Red Ice Giants popping up at
static locations.  Tired of having to tell players "Don't do that" or
hearing players expect me to do something for them from their own stupidity.
I even have it on my bio for examination "If I am anon, I am not porting."

Hopefully, people will get it into their head that other players help when
they want to, not just because you ask, but because they want to.  Being
rude to them like the dumb Barbarian mentioned above doesn't help you or
make you look any 'better' than the high level, just makes you equally jack
ass as you accuse the high level.
