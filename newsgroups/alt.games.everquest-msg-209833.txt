For a raid target, sure.  For an XP group, no, I'm afraid not.  Knight 
classes are generally preferred for xp groups due to their superior aggro 
holding ability.  While I won't turn a warrior away, I certainly prefer 
one of the knight classes as the MA, it makes a big difference in when I 
can slow a mob.  With the right equipment a warrior can come close enough 
so as not to really matter, but, a Paladin or SK already has the spells 
to do it.
