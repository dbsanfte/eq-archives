How did you manage to steal a nodrop item off your alt? If it isn't really 
a testament of Vanear, but some other book, go get a testament...

Go to the Karanas. Forage a couple of plains pebbles. Imbue them with the 
level 29 spell (you *did* buy that, didn't you?). Give them to your 
friendly neighbourhood enchanter with a couple of gold bars for some cheap 
4WIS earrings (yes, more WIS than Forest Loops). They have some neg STR, 
but what do you care? And you shouldn't be charged too much just to have a 
couple of gold bars enchanted and a combine button pressed for you.

I would concentrate on getting a full suit of cheap WIS gear just so you're 
wearing *something*, then upgrading it slot-by-slot when you have the cash. 
Some el cheapo stuff is:

Wrists - PBBS (3 WIS, 100pp)
Face - Silver Ruby Veil (4 WIS, 200pp)
Neck - Blackened Iron Medallion (3 WIS, 30pp)
Feet - do the acolyte's anklet quest (2 WIS, quested)
Chest - Foreman's Tunic (3 WIS, 100pp)
Arms - Ulthork Hide Arms (3 WIS, 100pp, or get a group and kill Ulthork 
Hunters yourself)
Legs - not much available here. Maybe you could camp the ancient croc in 
Upper Guk for Gator legs, but that's about all that's available for druids 
before Kromriff military leggings, planar or velious/twilight quest armour 
etc.
Hands - Splitpaw Hide Gloves (2 WIS, often on the vendors in SK for about 
5pp, or go whack some spire gnolls)
Back - Kunzar Cloak, Cloak of the Rygorr Oracles, etc (Kunzar about 200pp 
maybe, 2 WIS)
Fingers - Jasper rings, as good as you can afford (silver/platinum/velium)
Primary - Spend weeks doing the Paw of Opolla quest or get a cheap WIS 
weapon (Velium etched stone mace or something - dirt cheap now that 
everyone has Centi Warhammers since SoL)
Secondary - Testament of Vanear or Charred Guardian Shield
Head - er, savant's cap is 3 WIS iirc, or for a bit more get a runed 
circlet.
Range - 2 WIS player made pottery idol, they should be quite cheap these 
days.
Belt - Crystalline Belt (3 WIS), or find a mana belt (Blood Wolf Harness 
etc - these may be expensive since they're used in the Kromrif leggings 
quest, but a variant of it sometimes drops, a crested blood wolf harness, 
which isn't usable in the quest so is probably quite cheap - AC7 30mana)

Dawnshroud peaks is good for a druid at that level. Since you don't have 
huge amounts of WIS (and hence mana), you could try Zelniaks - they're 
wimps, low hp. Set up by Sanctus Seru zone, pull the zelniaks to the zone 
then fear kite them from there. Pathing near that zone is such that they'll 
turn when hit so you can fear kite without them straying too far and 
running past lots of aggro adds. The zelniaks themselves aren't social, 
they won't help each other.

Another option for xp hunting which may help with the armour situation is 
to go hunt brutes in the cave outside Dalnir in Warsliks Woods. Save all 
the regular and high quality brute hides you get, forage and imbue some 
plains pebbles in the Karanas, and scour the ground in Misty Thicket for 
acorns. Many tailors will do free combines on non-trivial stuff if you 
supply the components, so you could get some vale leather made (since 
you're in range to get xp from the brutes anyway). Just check the forums on 
www.eqtraders.com etc to find a halfling tailor on your server who can make 
the stuff. Not much WIS on it, but better than nothing until you can 
replace it.
