What do you mean in the way the other 4 do?  I know the Singing Short Sword
will give the same bonus to instrument songs that a store bought instrument
would when holding it.  It also gives an 80% bonus to some songs that were
previously only singing skill.   Now that's off of EQdiva.  But I think I
know what you mean in that there is no added % to the song using the SS
sword except for a few singing songs.
