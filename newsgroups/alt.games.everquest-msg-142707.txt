    So the hammer does 1200 DPM, if you're in melee range and casting Yaulp
V. I'll be generous and say that our hammer pet will also be able to do 1200
DPM, if someone is in melee range. If the target is undead, the cleric could
sustain a DoT on it for 1500 DPM. So a cleric should be able to melee a low
blue, undead target (the sort you kill for XP) to death in about two
minutes.

    During that two minutes, the mob will beat the snot out of the cleric.
To mitigate, the cleric will need to be stunning the mob frequently (MoK
won't help - the cleric isn't actually hitting often, the hammer proc is
what's doing the damage). I'll assume damage from stuns offsets damage not
done by melee when casting stuns. The cleric does not med at all during
this, but rather regains mana at the relatively slow rate Yaulp V provides.
At the end, the cleric will need a heal, likely a CH.

    Mana spent during the fight will be 250 for a hammer pet, about 1000 for
doing and re-doing the anti-undead DoT, perhaps 100-odd for MoR, a boatload
for stuns, and 400 for a CH. We've assumed no resists.

    The same cleric can root-nuke using Judgement. Takes about nine casts of
Judgement to kill the same mob, you'll need eight Roots (it always breaks),
and a CE at the end. So 2925 mana for nukes, 100-odd for roots, and 300 for
CE. This cleric can catch some med ticks. We've assumed no resists.

    Conclusion: I can certainly see the new method being more efficient -
any strategy based around melee damage is going to be, usually. The new
method seems to require resists to be low to be efficient - if stuns aren't
working you need to root and back off to heal early, which will also get the
hammer pet killed. Root-nuke already handles bad resists well - I never
assumed a root would hold, and Judgement usually does land for full or
near-full on XP mobs. The new method is also very busy - Yaulp every 24
seconds, Epitaph every 30 seconds, stuns at a high frequency, and no chance
to stop that until the target is dead. New method REALLY relies on
channeling. You also must replace whatever nice mainhand item you have with
the hammer.

    I'd be willing to give it a shot. But I don't feel it will work
long-term. Test clerics reported soloing the entry of Howling Stones and the
entry of Chardok. The entry of Chardok is overcamped as-is. And the entry of
Howling Stones is only going to support one cleric. I don't feel the hunting
areas exist to support a bunch of clerics soloing undead. I'm sure we'll
see, though, since I doubt that the Dev team will NOT implement this on live
servers.
