 Hi:

Some time ago I wanted to disable screen caps so my son wouldn't fill the
drive with em.  I figured out how it was done, and then promptly forgot.
Now I have absolutely no idea how to re-enable them.  Doea anyone out there
know how?  Ive read the doc and txt manual files and looked through
eqclient.ini, but no luck yet.

Thanks
