You should have about 1 buff slot here, and keep haste in it since its 
duration sucks.

In the order I'd swap them out for offensive spells:

SoW lasts 36 minutes post-level 12.  Easily long enough that you can keep 
it unmemmed and pull it up when you need it.  "But this leaves me screwed 
if it drops during a fight!"  Suck it up, you're only level 30.  Death 
doesn't mean that much at this point.  And pay attention to the time.  
Figure out your average time for a kill and keep track of how many you've 
killed since you last SoW'd.

I estimate regen lasts just under 10 minutes for you at level 30.  If 
something is taking 10 minutes to kill, you better be getting _insane_ xp 
per kill.  Otherwise, just refresh it every kill or two or three.  You 
still have your heal up in case it drops, and while less efficient, if 
regen is keeping your health up while fighting at less than one hp per 
second healed, you should be getting like 5 minutes of fighting time out of 
1 greater heal.  The casting time on this is long enough that you'll 
probably have to root the mob to cast anyway, so what's a few more seconds 
to get it memmed?

Quickness should be lasting 6-7 minutes.  It'll be a pain if you have to 
keep memming this one, so I'd make this the default in the buff slot.

PS: http://lucy.fnord.net is a MUCH better resource for looking up stats on 
spells.  About the only thing the spell listings on crgaming are good for 
are looking up where to buy the spells.  And even then it sucks because 
they haven't listed where you can buy 'em in PoK (my druid is looking at 
hitting 44 soon, I got almost all her spells in PoK despite none of them 
being listed as purchaseable there).  Just gotta look out for the ones that 
don't actually exist in the game :)
