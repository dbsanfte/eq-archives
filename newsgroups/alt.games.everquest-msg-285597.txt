Once you've experienced WoW's quests - you'll realize just how
crappy the quests in EQ were.  I'm not talking just rewards (those
are ok to nice) but I'm talking ATMOSPHERE, STORY, just pure FUN.

Once you've experienced a boss encounter in a low level dungeon
with all its scripting and attention to detail, simply sitting in
one spot pulling and hoping a named pops will seem old hat.

And LDoN's?  Those were the ultimate in grinds:  How fast can
we down this so we can get another is about the sole determinant.
