>Does anyone really do these anymore?  I remember making my way into

Every chance I get.  I'm running out of dungeons, though.

I've never been to D. Nec, nor do I know anything about it.  It's on my 
list.

I was out of town this past weekend, but my guild took some people to Kael 
and did a "crawl" through there, not knowing where the camps or anything 
were.  They had a blast, and we're doing it every Saturday morning from now 
on.

We did Howling Stones not too long ago.  We went to Seb to do 4R/Emp but it 
was taken, so we crawled through the other wings we had never been to.  
We're going to take a trip to the bottom of Seb soon and find out what fun 
lurks below that can wipe our group.

If I can convince some others, I'll probably take my BST through the Dalnir 
/ Kaesora / HS / Seb crawls while leveling him up.  He's curently parked in 
LoIO muttering at me under his breath because I leveled my rogue instead of 
him.

Nurga and Drogo seem like fun places so we'll probably be visiting them a 
bit in the near future.
