With 8 slots per server and a whole lot of servers to choose from, I 
think I will have lots to do.

I don't mind it taking a lot longer to solo, as long as I have fun. 
Whether or not the soloing with those classes meets my definition of fun, 
I guess I will wait and see.

I have done a lot of reading on both of those. I have Guild Wars and 
enjoy it, but I also wanted to try EQ. I have some good friends that 
enjoy it and figured what the hell. I have looked at WoW as well, but I 
think that I will wait a while before I pick it up and start it. 

Thanks again. I just installed the Platinum pack, and am waiting for it 
to finish patching before I install the OoW and DoN.
