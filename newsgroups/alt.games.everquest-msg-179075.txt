Run
'Til you find the answer
Time out
For our poor Cassandra
She's fairly safe inside the fire

Inside the fire
Awakes desire
Cruelly admired

They'll torture her soul
And they'll torment her heart
But won't change her mind

Would you like to see me
How I'll cut off
Her head life's a game
A lesson to learn
Don't be shy just blame me
Well, there is no
Need to feel ashamed
Remember the oath
Remember the oath

Wake up
It's time to cross the border
Is it true what they say
About the part you've played?

Enjoy your stay here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse

Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Please understand
It's not in our hands
Barren the land
It's all dead and gone

And still the tyrant's face is red
So witness my glory, my triumph, my fame
It's the sweetest taste

King of terror just stop wining
Hold your breath it won't take long
Realize this is your judgement day
In between the killing carry on

There are no rules here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse

Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Try to understand

You're the artificial enemy
An illusion we all need
For our sake
For our sake

We're not allowed to see beyond that's your skill
Will we ever learn the lesson "We can't fly with broken wings"

Break the chains
Time to change
I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part

It's been nice we now get to the climax
Your destination's unknown
Just get out of my way

Don't mind the blood here
Welcome to the slaughterhouse

Release from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will believe
Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods

Under the ice you will be free
Released from rotten thoughts
No more pain
And no more gods
And no more gods
(No more gods)

I'm afraid to say but you won't play a part
