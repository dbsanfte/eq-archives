Don't have an answer but I DO have a follow-up question...

Is it easy to solo in Hate these days?  If so what would be the
minimum you'd do it in...Say 61 Necro with decent gear, or perhaps a
63 Druid with decent gear.  I have both, and can bot if necessary.

It has been AGES since I was up there and I did it on raids that way
back then were SCARY.  Hehe, a lot has changed...
