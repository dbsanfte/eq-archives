I'm getting lazy and my usual method of taking out greens these days
is '/pet attack'. <g> An Alpha pet with Focus and Haste (and FA if I'm
bored) does a surprisingly good job of mowing through greens.

Problem is, you can't consider it mana free. Those 1500pts of damage
took you at least a minute where you where doing nothing but clicking
your bracer (and medding if you;re on a horse). Compare that to
casting a BoN and cannibalizing the mana back. 

If I had another two spell slots, I'd bag the JBB in a heartbeat. 
 My main problem is that I usually only have one slot for an offensive
spell and that's usually either BoS or BoN. I still find myself using
BoN in preference to Saryn often, Affiction Efficiency and Burning
Affliction 3 still make it an amazingly efficient spell, almost 2k
damage for under 300 mana.

Only if you yell "Space Ghooost" while doing it! :p
