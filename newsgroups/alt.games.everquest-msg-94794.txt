It could be any number of reasons:
Someone pulling, someone running, a druid whose snare didn't stick on the first
cast, etc, unless you talk to the person ( and you didn't?) you will probably
never know.

Different people will react in different ways:
If the person was running - then he probably never saw you, and therefore will
never know to thank you.
If the person was pulling - then he probably still didn't see you , and won't
know who to berate. 

The majority of (sensible) players aren't going to get worked up over an orc in
any case, but there are some who will quite happily petition you for killing
that moss snake they so desperately needed.

For future reference though, next time you might just want to follow and make
sure of their intentions,  click on them and check their health, and if
possible a quick tell "need help" etc, if they do need help it doesn't take
much for them to tap /y, or if they are running, invite them and selo them to
the zone to make sure they gets there.

It's usually in your own best interest to make sure before you get stuck in -
it may sound a little callous but being kind is usually what bites you in the
ass the hardest.
