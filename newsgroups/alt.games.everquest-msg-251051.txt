I agree with you to an extent.  I just didn't care very much for how
you presented your point the first time by telling everyone how
"fcuked up" they are for playing EQ.  Your paragraphs below should
have been the first post.

That aside, I think Sony is being hypocritical as a company by putting
little features into the game like the Timer and putting up their
little disclaimers while at the same time counting on the addiction of
the players to sell new expansions at 30 and 40 dollars a
pop...sometimes twice in the same year.  

It's very easy to get caught up in playing EQ because once you've paid
your month, 3 months, 6 months or year subscription then you can play
all you want.  Most college students don't have a lot of extra money
and their mom's and dad's are pretty much footing the bill for college
so there is no money out of their pocket if they decide to play EQ
instead of going to class.   So, in that respect, I agree with you.
People are sitting around without jobs because they don't really want
to look for one and want to play EQ.  It's more entertaining.  When it
comes time to pay the bills, they either call mom or dad or go get a
loan or pop it on a credit card until the limit runs out.  Not to
mention that is adding a whole new deminsion to their problems.

Now, can Sony really help it if the majority of the public is addicted
to their game?  Not really.  They are raking in the cash.

Could they use some of their earnings to do a little more to help
players be a little more responsible.  Probably.   I think it's a lot
easier to give up the game if you really don't have a lot of friends
who play.  If you have made several permanent friends in the game and
even real life friends, it makes it more difficult because they only
way you mainly get to see them and interact with them is inside the
game.  If someone is in the professional counseling business, I see a
whole new field opening up in helping people deal with situations like
this.  

You have a good point (and I'm sure a lot of others agree with you)
but what exactly can be done about it?  I know some people that have
smashed their CDs to bits but not everyone is willing to do that.
Sony has their consumers right where they want them.  They are sitting
on top of the MMORPG goldmine.
