All quests include talking to an NPC at some point, or at least giving them
something.  The newbie quest is just one of thousands of quests in the game.
Most classes and races have very specific quests that require the player to
collect a variety of items from the hunting grounds around his/her starting
city.  Then the items are combined in a special container that you get from
a particular NPC to make various armor pieces.

A quest can be as simple as turning in a single item, like a Crushbone belt
from an Orc, for experience, a little money and a piece of low end armor.
Or it can be as complex as a quest that requires multiple steps, covers many
zones, requires tradeskills, and an entire raid force to complete.
