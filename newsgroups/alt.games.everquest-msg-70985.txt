So the real point is "I don't know him, he's a smuck for getting
800pp extra on the first hunt."   I assume you'd think he'd be
right for doing a /guildremove and /occ "this guild is full of smucks,
they won't even cover my 'dot costs" if his first hunt with the guild
had resulted in him losing a few hundred in 'dot costs, right?

If you don't expect the cleric to *always* be compensated for
the cost of the Symbols he casts *on each raid/group*, you've
pretty much given up the right to determine he has to break
even on his first group with the guild.  He *might* have come
out ahead;  he *might* have come out even;  he might have
come out behind.   Why is only the one where he comes out
ahead unacceptable?
