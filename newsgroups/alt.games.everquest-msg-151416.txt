One zone I can think of that will help you practice is Lake Rathetear.
Running around the water due to artificial zone lines you'll be forced down
sometimes, causing you to fall.  I know cause taking my cleric there MANY
times to go hunt HG's in Rathe I've fallen for damage before.  And YES the
skill is useful.  My monk has it of course and running around I never have
to worry about taking more than 1-3hps in damage from falling if any at all,
and also going to the frenzied room in LGuk is of course easier, just hari
kari it and drop down.  Oh ouch, 10 pts of damage.  Oh dear!  :P
