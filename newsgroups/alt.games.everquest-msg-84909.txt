Cable modem...hmmm.  @home.com.  *Hmmmmm*.  Verant can't help, because
the problem is probably not at their end.  You can't do anything,
because the problem is probably not at your end.  The problem is in
between, and it's not just getting you, and not just getting EQ
players.  DAoC players on cable have also been getting hit.

Below are some recent posts from Mythic about this, which are just as
applicable to EQ as DAoC.

(Yeah, I mentioned Mythic.  Josh, Ben Sisson, and Drake can go fuck
themselves).

    If you are going LD a lot, the question is: Are you a cable modem
    user?  With @Home going to hell, and a lot of shared networks
    across the country, a lot of cable modem users are having problems
    playing DAOC.  Yes, your internet connection is still on. Yes, you
    can access the web with no problems. The cable network is still
    too shaky to handle our game in some places. Your problems will
    clear up as your provider routes around the areas served by
    now-bankrupt cable modem providers.

    We've looked into it from our end, and we aren't having problems
    with anything that we control. Ironically, people on modems have
    better connections than players on cable right now. We know we
    have a lot of customers who use cable, and we're doing what we can
    to mitigate the effects on those users (splitting some packets,
    etc), but the problem is not us.

    BTW - Worldcomm/UUNet, if you contact them, is going to give you a
    form letter, unless you are direct customer of UUNet. You have to
    complain to your ISP, and pray that someone there knows how to
    move something up the chain.

    There is a peering point (between Qwest and AOL) between those two
    IP addresses. If your traceroute shows you going through either IP
    address, you will have problems staying connected.

    This is in addition to the stuff I posted earlier.

    The person who helped us confirm this posted in the eight page
    thread earlier, FYI. Thanks much =)
