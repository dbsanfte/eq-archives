As far as I know, the only factor other than mob level is the zone
multiplier. Dungeons tend to have higher zone multipliers, therefore
an even con mob in Splitpaw would yield more xp than an even con mob
in South Karana. However, there would be no difference between two
different types of even-con mobs in the same zone. There's no bonus
for the mob being a caster, or whatever.

I don't believe this is the case, unless mob A and mob B are in 
different zones.

Ulthork hunters are low 30s in level, frost giant scouts closer to
mid 30s, so should yield more xp per kill. But -- Frost giants have
very high hitpoints for their level. Ulthork hunters don't. Chances
are that your group was killing the ulthorks at a much higher rate.

For xp production, you want mobs that you can kill fast with as
little downtime as possible between kills *and* that you can
pull as soon as you're ready without having to go scouting.
Best of all, do this in a dungeon for the higher zone multiplier.
