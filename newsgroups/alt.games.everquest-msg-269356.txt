While there are numberous odd ways to raise your begging skill (the one 
I found most incongruous was when you could beg from the mast of the 
ship carrying you across the Ocean of Tears), I can't think of a single 
use for the skill; as a money maker its got to be the least efficient 
thing in the game, if someone with a 200 beg skill can clear a pp an 
hour with it I'd be very surprised; and I can't think of a quest, for 
any class or race, that hinges on a beg success.

Begging -is- useful, but in an odd way.  Failing a beg attempt seems to 
annoy the mob you are begging from.   Thus, failing begging is a taunt.

Unlike every other skill in the game, this one becomes less useful the 
higher your skill; the odds of you failing drops as you get better at 
it, and thus it acts as less of a taunt.

Seems to me you should only use this skill in cases where you are having 
a hard time holding aggro, and you should make a point of not wearing 
your wis/int gear when you do so, in order to minimize the chances of 
skill ups!
