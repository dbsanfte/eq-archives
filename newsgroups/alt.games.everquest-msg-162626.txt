My guess is that you're spending too many practice points on melee skills
and not enough on casting skills.  Remember that the beastlord, though
something of a melee class, also relies massively on spells (at least mine
does).  I would train up your melee skills in combat, putting minimal points
into them, and put most of your points into the skills used for spells that
you don't cast often (not much chance to train) but really need to cast when
you do cast them... like your warder buff spells.

So far I've put about half my points into casting and I have very little
problem with fizzles... Occasionally my spell will fizzle, but mostly it'll
cast just fine.
