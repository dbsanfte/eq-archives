Monks and rogues have two combat buttons: Autoattack and special attack.

Warriors have three: Autoattack, special attack, taunt.

Even if you add in evade/FD as combat abilities, that's not exactly the
"ton" that would make you think "warriors need more options as well".

And out of combat?  Rogues have some decent utility with sneak/hide and
picklocks.  Monks and warriors have nothing.
