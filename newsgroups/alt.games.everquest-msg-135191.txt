Well it depends on the situation I guess.. under water than sure, but even
as a cleric.. at the upper levels you should have a minimum of 100sta

I think your probably right.   I see a massive difference between naked
combat and fully geared combat (a difference of 700 ATk or so) excluding
haste.. and even my naked ATK is double anything a fully geared caster is
likely to have

My cleric is more often than not me on an alt computer, and its too much
effort to keep him in the right position to attack, for the 1dps hes going
to add to the fight :)

Im a firm believer that casters melee is an absolute joke, and only becomes
"ok" when a high procing weapon is used, and is procing a lot.  And even
then, they can do a lot more damage by sitting on their ass, medding, and
doing what they do best (like nuking)

Heres an example. a guild 60 mage posted this -
****
Melee dmg on THO by me : 1,811
Melee proc dmg on THO by me : 12,400
Total dmg :14,211
