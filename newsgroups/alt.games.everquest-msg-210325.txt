What are you talking about, enchanters stack just fine.  Since you are the
highest DPS melee class in the game, there's no need to be shy.  The command is
/pet attack, I know you ditched it thinking that your animations don't listen to
a thing you say, but the secret is that charmed pets do... and charmed pets
outdamage every class out there.

Trouble with enchanters is they tend to get stuck in the rut of thinking that
they are required for CC and hasting and slowing, with no time left over for
charm pet killing... but in a raid sized force, the "leftover" chanters get to
embarass the rest of the guild by outdamaging everyone!

Even in a group, a second chanter can go Charm mode while the lead chanter stays
in the vital CC/slower/buffer" mode.

If you want to complain about not stacking, try being a warrior sometime.
