Here's one for you EQ. Have you ever referred to a dead person by declaring
them "a great friend" or "a really good golfer" or "an upstanding citizen",
etc?  You pick your description.  This person is now dead, so by you're
reasoning they can't be any of those things.  Yet they are still referred to
as "being" those things.  In the same way an individual who was gay while
alive still is gay once dead.  If it makes you feel better, we can argue the
semantics of "was gay" or "was a great golfer" or "was a good friend".
