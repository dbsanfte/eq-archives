Take a look at the thread I cited above from the Shaman's Crucible. Doesn't
look like there's much question about how this works, just the cutoff point
from "Slightly" to "Partial" to "Mostly". I agree, Shamans should be the
best slowers and it looks like they are, from the data I've seen. The log
files parsed (and attached to the message) are pretty revealing (even if
they are a small sample).
