At first, I thought Class Action Lawsuit.  Then, I borrowed a high
powered microscope from my chemistry lab and placed the tab from the
bottom of the Luclin box under it and it reads:

"The use of Everquest: The Shadows of Luclin is subject to acceptance
of certain terms and conditions included inside this box, and the use
of Everquest: The Shadows of Luclin indicates acceptance to such terms
and conditions.  Everquest: The Shadows of Luclin can only be played
when connected to certain online environments, which may require the
acceptance of additional terms and the payment of additional fees."
