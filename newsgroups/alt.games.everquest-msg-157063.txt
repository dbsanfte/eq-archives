I go back to basically day 1, so I had some pretty funny firsts.I remember
buying a bronze helm for 17pp, and proudly showing it off everywhere. People
used to stop me and ask where I got such a thing and to marvel at the
wonderful bird-like shape (I was a wood-elf).

First buff ever cast upon me was SOW. I had no idea what was going on. I
remember the druid casting on me, and I just stood there waiting for
something to happen. She told me to "move", and I did, like the wind. Ever
since, running without SOW or Selo's has been aggrevating.

My first ever night of camping involved my group taking a whole night to
camp for a Cold Iron Morning Star from the Preacher in Permafrost. We must
of spent about 6 hours in there, inching our way closer and closer to the
Preacher Room. It was probably still one of my favorite times in EQ.
