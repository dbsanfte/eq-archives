Summoned water is not very valuable to anyone.  5cp is not very valuable to 
anyone.   Those two examples are obvious, deliberate insults.  If that is 
all you have to give, then just don't give anything, it's less insulting.  
I do agree that people who say "donations" are usually not being completely 
upfront, what they really mean is "what I consider a resonable amount of 
cash or a reasonable item(s)".  There are those out there who really do 
cast for donations, and continue to do so, but, I bet even they would be 
insulted by 5cp or a stack of summoned water.
