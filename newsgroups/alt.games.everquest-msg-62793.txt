  Would help if we knew what you had now. :)  You could get a foreman's
tunic, Zaharn's Coronet, maybe braided ivory cords, a prayer cloth of Tunare
if not, gold jasper earrings, black iron medallion, a mithril frog totem
(nice primary handheld item until you get a Paw of Opolla or something
better)... ect.

  Though, as a druid, equipment isn't really crucial for you.  Druids can be
soloed into the 50's almost naked.

  At 29, you can probably get a lot of the items I mentioned on your own.
If you're willing to do some camping, you can camp the goblin alchemist in
Permafrost in hopes of his nice mammoth hide cloak.  I think I did that camp
around level 40, but I think it's doable at 29.  Good luck. :)
