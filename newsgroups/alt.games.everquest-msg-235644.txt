If your going to let your heart bleed for those starving Indians then
you might as well shoot for pay equity too. Because without it we are
still taking advantage of them. We propping up our massive wealth
disparity. You in fact are doing the one thing that will ensure you
"keep those starving indians in their place".

set up a booth, everybody *should* howl, not just the "socialists".
