I wish I had base 80 strength, If I hadn't just bought EQ when I made my
character I might have 85 strength..... I don't have a higher level
character to twink me with a wurmy or even a few plat when I needed it at
level 9 for my spells.  I'm not blaming anyone, and I'm not a greedy loot
whore, 99% of the time I gotta look at piles of weapons rotting on the
ground cuz I can't carry even one thing, it'll get me even more encumbered.
Just make sure split is on and I'm a little happy.  Just don't play in
Dawnshroud, you gotta make sure you keep track of whoever looted last,
otherwise what little loot that does drop won't get shared.

One last thing Kaev, get a grip, it's a game!
