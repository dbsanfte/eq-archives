Went to the bazaar this morning and sought out BAR BER range slot items 
with all effects; the only thing which seemed to fit the bill was 
something that procs a snare; sort of silly given that I'm a berserker, 
possibly the best "we need a snare right now" class in the game.  But 
they were only 3pp each, what the heck, lets try it out.

Picked one up, put it in range slot with my normal damage axes in ammo 
slot, went into Neth and found a little greenie alien to test on.  Got 
in range, one throw, second throw I'm out of ammo.  Look, and my range 
slot is empty, ammo slot still has its stack of 20 axes.

SO, so much for "even though you are using up the ones in the ammo 
slot"; apparantly thats not necessarily consistent.

Still a nice dream though, so I'll keep an eye out for other proccing 
range items which might work better.
