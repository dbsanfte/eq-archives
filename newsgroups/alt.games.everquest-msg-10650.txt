For any of you who sometimes say things to your group or guild and hit
return before you realize what you just said...

Fighting in Skyfire Mountains, and the Druid I am with got a double
pull by accident. I peel one off, Fear it, and start stacking DoTs on
it to kill it as fast as possible.

I made a comment to my friend about how I "thought I had overcast" on
the first Mob. Anyone remember what a Bottomless Feaster looks like?



I had to threaten to hurt him to stop him from posting a screenshot of
my comment to the EQ websites.
