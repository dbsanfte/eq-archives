Except that the orcs are completely camped on my server, rodcet nife... the
crushbone ones anyway. The ones in east and west commons are up for grabs,
as WC especially is often totally empty now.

I think that they made a mistake with PC, they give you zero incentive to be
anywhere else at that level range in terms of loot and xp, and so the zone
becomes overcrowded and dominated by aggressive types. Simply nerf the xp
rate and people would look at alternatives; either that, or give the xp
bonus to other zones.
