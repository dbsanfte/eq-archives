If you do not plan on going on major raids Guilded or not you really don't
need the Epic. Many may disagree but the Cleric Epic only comes into play
when Resing player after player in a raid where you don't have time to med.
It is very nice to have for its stats alone but not really needed unless on
a raid. Best way to get the res stick is join one of the major guilds on
your server and assist other members in getting there epics. Most guilds put
a high priority on getting the Clerics in the guild a res stick.
