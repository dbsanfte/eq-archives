No they go LD on big raids because of packet flood. It's a connection issue
not a Graphic/CPU one.
The only way system spec can be an issue here is if the modem is software
driven (winmodem) then it requires the CPU to operate and if that is busy
drawing the zone it could cause a disconnect.
Hard drive thrashing sounds a bit worrying but I'd still try other ISP's
first and also confirm that your modem is a hardware one.
