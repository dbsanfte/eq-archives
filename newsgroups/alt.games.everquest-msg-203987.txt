That would be sweet.

Then they could alow access through the sony station stie so that you can 
buy and sell on line out of the game (but requiring an account).

Then they could give us downloadable price tickers so that we can monitor 
the futures market.

Have e-mail alerts when a specific item goes on sale below a specific 
price.

I would love all of this, but I doubt that they will do it :-(
