I ran my cleric to the Deep from GD (crap trip when bound outside luclin)
for a guild raid, cast divine light.. LOADING PLEASE WAIT.

Ah shit..  i said I accidently gated him, so im not bringing him back - he
was only the third cleric there tho, so I didn't really have much choice if
I wanted to see the THO die (not like he drops anything worthwhile, damn
verant and their loot nerfs)
