Hehe sorry couldnt resist it, as Tzen got his a few weeks ago...

To answer your question, before Tzen got his first Epic blade, he had
a Green Jade Broad Sword in the off hand.  11/25 and 8 STR and STA as
well as a few saves.  Not a bad blade.  Main hand was a Centi LS
(14/27 also 8 STA and STR).

I know they say it's best to put your fastest weapon in your main hand
but I got better DPS with the above combo.

In fact, the he only recently upgraded (i.e. last week) to a Lammy in
the main hand.  I don't really notice much extra aggro, as I have been
mostly soloing the last few weeks, or in a "trio" with a fellow ranger
(also with Swifty) and a cleric friend where I'd be the main tank
anyway.
