I got a friend who has always had a pretty crappy connection, relatively
speaking (which means worse than mine).  Anyway, as of the 1/28 patch he
gets booted to the server select screen with no warning.  The lag bar
will be green, no PL, etc then its just wham, server select.  Trying to
log back on immediately gets the standard 1018 at this point.

Its fairly random.  Usually about once an hour, but sometimes he can go
2-3 hours without it happening, and sometimes it will happen within 5
minutes of being on.  Obviously its hell on gameplay.

We have tried a lot of stuff.  Switched ISPs.  Switched phone lines.
Switched modems (no broadband at all where he lives...).  Switched
drivers.  Turned off damn near *everything* in the startup/services/etc.
Nothing has made a diff.

I checked the tech board on the EQLive site and saw that a small handful
of people are having the same problem right around the same time.  The
blue names are no help, and so far none of the people there have
resolved their issues.  The only common thread seems to be the OS.

He runs XP, on a relatively new comp.  Next step is an OS reinstall, but
I just thought I would post here to see if anyone had any suggestions.

Thanks
olaf
