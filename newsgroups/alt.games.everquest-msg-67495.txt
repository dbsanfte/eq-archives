Agreed. A well-planned and well-coordinated raid is unbelievably fun.
Clerics chealing the MA nonstop on a rotation cycle. Adds mezzed or
split tanked depending on the call. Mob strengths and weaknesses
announced and exploited. Everyone fully buffed, and buffs meticulously
maintained by designated casters. 

My guild raided the Halls of Testing in ToV yesterday. The first pull
was a wipeout (3 ancient wurms = bad news). Twelve minutes later we
were pulling again. We took down 46 level 60+ mobs with only a handful
of deaths here and there. Strategy is everything.

OMG yes. Every single time I've heard that my heart has stopped.
Usually what you hear right before that is, "The chanters are down!".
I've got some nice screenshots taken a second or two before I was
killed by some badass ("Yetarr hits YOU for 490 points of damage.")

I've never participated in a dragon raid but I've been hit with the
area fear. ("Oh cool, they're killing Talendor. Let's go get a
screenshot... uh, why am I running away?")

The post-50 game is unbelievably fun, especially if you're in a guild
that does a lot of raiding (Planes, Kael, ToV etc.)
