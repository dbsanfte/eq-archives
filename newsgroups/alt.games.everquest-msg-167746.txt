I tried this with Condemnation, and it Seemed to work, but didn't.  I
refeshed the Condemnation Icon, all right, but was unable to cast the spell
anyway.

What does seem to work is that there are certain spells which prevent
casting of any other spell for a few seconds after cast.  Using an insta
click (I have a spyglass for this) allows me to circumvent this so I can
cast spell one, clicky, spell two... but I can't cast spell one till its
normal refresh timer runs out.

If I could, I could chain cast Divine Aura... 18 minute refresh time!
(fifteen?  too long to chain cast anyway)
