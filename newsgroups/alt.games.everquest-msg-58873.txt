A lot depends on how (or if) Verant deals with the uberloot problem.
They've put a lot of rediculously overpowered items in the game, first
with Kunark and then with Velious.  The situation now is that level 60
players with uberloot are massively better than level 60 players with
ordinary loot.

This makes it hard to design new content.  With Luclin, there will be
a reason for even level 60 people to earn XP.  Now consider what that
means when they, say, want to add a new dungeon for the high level
crowd.  If they make it so that it is a challenge for the uberguilds,
then it will be too hard for the ordinary high level guilds.  If, on
the other hand, they make it reasonable for the ordinary high level
players, the uberguilds will move in and farm it for XP.  Before the
runaway item inflation, you didn't have a vast disparity in power
among most people at a given level, so all you had to do was adjust
the levels of the mobs in a dungeon, and you could get your target
people in there, and keep others out (people too low would get killed,
people too high wouldn't get good XP).  Adjusting mob level doesn't
work when the people you want and the people you don't want in a given
dungeon are the same level!
