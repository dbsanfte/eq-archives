Work your 2hs now you will need it badly later, and if you can find a good
blade at a good price take it and use it if only to keep you skill up to you

you lack the skill to use it properly and will either have a very hard time
advancing your skill or will pay a great deal of money to trainers to get it
up to a dependable level.
