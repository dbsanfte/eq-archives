Okay this is sad, I look at this list and I see that I have the 3 hardest
ones to do.  Of course I also have 1 middle of the road, 1 fairly easy, and
the easiest.  Something tells me that this is going to be a very time
consuming set of pursuits.

The only advantage is that I only have one character that is even remotely
close to being able to do his right now.
