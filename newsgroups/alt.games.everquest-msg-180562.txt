No, he isn't.  I have a tolan bracer.  The arrows are 3 damage, 50
range, magic (*can* hit magic), and of course no rent.

For those of you claiming that the Tolan's bracer isn't all that
important, you haven't hit a level where it becomes an amazing
addition to a pre-level 59, EQ ranger.  They are well worth the prices
people are charing, in part because they are rare and difficult to
get.  (Drops in Sebilis).

I use mine constantly.
