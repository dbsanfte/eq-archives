Yeah, the new crafting system shines an interesting spotlight on the rest of 
the game that we play. Some don't like what they see because it's not what 
they expect, even though it's exactly what they're already doing. As I said 
in the original post, most of the complaints I've heard about this system 
ultimately boil down to that, I have yet to hear anything more substantive 
like "why can't I have schematics so that I can freeze my designs", or "I 
want experimentation so that I can vary the results of my combines". No, all 
I hear are variations on the "stupid and tedious" or "pacman that kills", 
from players who appear to be quite comfortable then going back to the 
combine/autoinventory routine or the button pushing, bar-watching game that 
gets them killed elsewhere.
