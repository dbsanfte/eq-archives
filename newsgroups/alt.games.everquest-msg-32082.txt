I'm an electrician, currently rewiring a school here in Utah. It's the
summer break, but I see the teachers there almost everyday. They have to
clean and reorganize their classrooms, get materials ready, and so on. I was
talking with one the other day and she was telling me about the mandatory
classes and seminars that they are required to attend in their summer
breaks. I also see how their classrooms are littered with stuff that they
buy themselves, with their own money, to aid them in teaching classes.

They make approximately 1/2 what I make, BTW, and there's no way in hell
that I'd use my own money and spare time to do what they do. As far as I'm
concerned teachers salaries should be doubled in most states, at the very
least.
