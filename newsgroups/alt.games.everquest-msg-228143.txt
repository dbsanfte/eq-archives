As a Guild Leader myself, that person's toon(s) would be /guildremove before he
or she could blink.  

Whether that behavior can be traced to your guild is irrelevant, the very fact
that this person knowlingly mispriced an item in order to scam unsuspecting
buyers is proof that they are nobody I would want to associate with.

Mispricings do indeed happen... for example I just sold a pair of Acrylia
(studded?.. I don't remember now) pants for 3pp.  LOL  I believe the more
correct price is closer to 150 pp or something, so someone got a nice little
deal...  My fault for doing that to myself.  So yes, I can see where some of
your officers hold the opinion that it is the fault of the buyer for not being
more aware, but still.

The seller bragging about it is 'proof' to me that they set out to defraud the
consumers in the bazaar and were damn proud when they accomplished it.

/guildremove and be done with him/her.

Just my 2 cents...
