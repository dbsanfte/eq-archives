The opposite opinion from yours on this subject (and yes, I'm going to
keep reminding you that you are expressing an opinion, not some fact
that you alone are privy to) has already been put to you by several
people. In each case, though you claimed to have "opened mind, rejected
argument", you've presented nothing to counter it other than "oh, you're
just whining. The sky is falling." blah blah blah.

I agree with Lokari. I'd be happy to continue to discuss the question if
you actually presented something besides rhetoric to back up your
conclusions. But your responses smack of nothing more than a Pee Wee
Herman voice saying, "I know you are, but what am I?"

It's a risk reward system. Always has been. Second fact is that EQ has
always been an extremely difficult game compared to other MMORPG offered
out there. That's part of the addiction and appeal. Dumbing it down
isn't doing any good in the long run. And there definitely *are* "rites
of passage" for many folks in the game. That's beyond obvious, though I
have no clue who you hang out with in game if this is some mystery to
you. Getting past 35 to lose the spell book is one. Overcoming the hell
levels is another. The hell levels apparently didn't stop *YOU* from
leveling, did they? No. But now it seems you've morphed into some Marvel
Comics superhero swooping in to rescue the future generations of players
who "just can't handle it" and will quit? Good for you. The world needs
more superheros.

And your arguments against the indication of a "slippery slope" (well
know phrase across the world and accepted as an indicator of things that
may come to pass) has been nothing but laughable.

Some of the changes in the upcoming patch look fine to me. VI makes
*MANY* good changes in these patches. They're just dropping the ball in
a big way on a couple of these. You may feel free to continue to be a
VAK and characterise anyone who criticizes individual changes as VI
haters who "complain no matter what they do", but it lends no credence
to your argument.
