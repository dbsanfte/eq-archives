It still made what could have been a difficult encounter for my guild into a
trivial exercise.  The MB wizards got him down to around two bubbles of
health, the rest of the casters/melee took care of the remainder quite
quickly.  The key was RF only getting off one, maybe two AoEs.  Very few
people were feared/DoTed.  I think it was one 49 bard who came to watch, one
56 enchanter, and a few pets, plus maybe one or two others.  The only death
was a different enchanter that chose to sit near RF spawn just before the
dragon form was spawned.  Likely without the MB wizards, we would have been
hit by 4 to 10 AoEs, which would have been much more likely to be
troublesome.
