You don't get an xp penalty for night vision though, its other stuff
that gives a penalty.

Wood elf, half elf, high elf, gnomes and dark elf are all at the same
XP table as human/erud and all have at least infra (dark elf ultra!)

Halfling is -5 penalty so has LESS of a penalty than those, and has
infra (this has always seemed like a mistake to me that verant won't
admit, I mean if you look at their stats they have GREAT stats though
they are small, about the only thing they get reamed on is charisma)

Barbarian is plus  10 percent penalty because has great sta and str to
start, bash even with two hand weapon, etc. Is blind as a human.

Ogre is plus 15 percent penalty for even larger sta and str, can't be
stunned from the front, bash even with two hand weapon, etc. Has
infra.

Troll is plus 20 percent for larger str, sta, bashing with 2 hand
weapon,  but in reality for regen really since that is all iksar is
getting it for. 

Iksar is plus 20 percent for regen, or maybe 100 swimming equals the
troll benefits which is why both are 20? You pretty much think its for
regen mostly in both cases.

So, as you can see, there is no xp penalty for vision at all since a
dark elf with the best vision shares the same xp as a human with one
of the worst and a halfling with infra is 5 percent faster.
