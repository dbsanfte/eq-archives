 Especially considering there are a lot of +STR items out there. The
same can't be said for +STA items. I think I am hitting 190 STR
unbuffed. And that's considering I was never a STR monk to begin with. I
divided my starting points between STA and AGI I think. If I had to do
it over I'd put more in STA but ah well. I'm fairly happy with my stats.
I don't think I would be if I had put the majority of my points into
STR.
