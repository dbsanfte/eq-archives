What ridiculous bullshit. The GPL was not invented to "kill commercial 
software". The GPL was invented to give sofware developers the option of 
releasing their code into public domain without others taking advantage 
of it by making their own changes and releasing it as their own work.

Bullshit. You've been swallowing too much MS propoganda lately.

I don't know about you, but I don't trust an entity which tries its best 
to take the freedom of choice away from the consumer.

You are wrong on one very important fact. If a developer releases his 
code under the GPL, all other development of that code must also be 
released under the GPL. However, the original developer has complete 
freedom in the first place to release his code under whichever license 
he chooses. The fact that his code may be developed to run under Linux, 
or Solaris, or Windows is irrelevent.

Writing applications for Linux does not mean you have to release it 
under the GPL.

They don't have to. Companies which choose to release software under the 
  GPL have the benefit of thousands of skilled programmers bugtesting 
and further developing their code, which the company can make money off 
through documentation, support and distribution.

The problem with the BSD licence is it allows others to rip off your 
code which you have released the source to, then develop their own code 
on top of it without having to release the added development source.

Sure the GPL may not provide for a viable business model, but as I 
pointed out above, a developer does not have to release his code under 
the GPL if he develops his original code for a GPL operating system.
