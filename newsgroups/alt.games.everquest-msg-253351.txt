Update

Up to level 40 Staff of Prosperity did maximum damage in 
the low fourties.
After Dinging 41 it seems as if the "hidden damage cap"
is lifted,maximun damage is now 72 !

Mobs do not last long enough now to deal serious damage,
me hasted with "Robe ofTopulami"(36% haste for 2k),and the
pet wielding 2 "Fists of Ixiblad(sp?)",even 2 rusty daggers
on the pet work well.
Of course this with pet and me properly buffed and mob
debuffed.

Meldur 41 Enchanter,curse of the Underbulks :)
