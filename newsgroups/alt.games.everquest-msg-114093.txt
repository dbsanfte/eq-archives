While I agree with you, if you inspect the news archives (www.google.com, 
for example), you will discover that Verant has always had an issue with 
this.  Most of the newsgroup attendees have come to expect that when a 
large patch is announced, there will be a major patch the same day and 
smaller patches on the next day or two.

If you're going to get this upset about this issue, you have bought the 
wrong game.  Since Verant has not improved over time, I suspect you will 
get angry about every two months or so when new content is released.
