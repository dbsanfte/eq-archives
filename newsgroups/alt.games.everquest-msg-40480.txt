Does the "only one over 200" rule apply to fishing too?  I am not close yet but
my 17th level enchanter's jewelry making skill is at 72 and my fishing skill is
up to 89.  I don't want to ruin my chance at 250 on jewelry skill just because
I spend too much time fishing while waiting for boatsâ€¦

Thanks,
John
