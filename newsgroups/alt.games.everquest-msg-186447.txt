    First step: your friend gets a Glyphed Rune to turn in for a 65 spell
(drops off various minibosses/bosses in Tier II+ zones), and gets lucky and
gets his charm spell.
    Second step: he goes to CoD, charms one particular type of undead, and
hopefully the undead area is clear of other groups/soloists. Three groups
can camp most of the zone without a problem. If the miniboss mob that pops
there is up, he needs to be despawned before you can camp the area for XP.
Despawning him is reasonably dangerous, and cannot be done responsibly with
other people in the zone. If he's despawned in this manner, he stays
despawned for one day.

    When he pulls, if he gets an add (fairly likely) he needs to run around
like a madman until the second mob sticks to his pet. He'll usually use some
advantageous pathing to do this, in one particular area. If charm breaks
when the pet is engaged, he usually has to Feign off the pull and re-charm.
Lord help him if Feign ever fails, as the pet alone can tear him to shreds
in less than two ticks. Most of the mobs there Enrage, so to save the pet
the necromancer must keep Force Shield up and run behind the pull to turn it
around at Enrage. The pet will regen to full when the necro feigns because
it's lost all aggro, and regens to full health like any other mob. It clears
aggro because you usually pick a spawn that's right near where you camp, so
when you feign it goes right back to its spawn point and clears aggro.

    Easy? Based on the number of train stories I've heard, and deaths I've
seen, it isn't easy. Good XP? Best in the game. Sounds like reasonably
balanced effort versus reward for what was the best solo class in the game,
no?
