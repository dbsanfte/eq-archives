Maybe we could put warnings on cars too, driving cars fast can cause
accidents. Or on Burger King, eating lots of these will make you fat. Or on
Pickled Onions, eating these will make your breath smell. I vote that the
warnings must take up 15% of the overall packaging and will be compulsory to
everyone.

My point?? Well if your too dumb to stop doing something when it starts to
effect you you dont deserve to be in the gene pool, goodbye you were the
weakest link!

Sympathy to those who lost loved ones but really, if it hadnt been EQ or FF8
or whatever it probably would have been TV or Pr0n that killed them.
