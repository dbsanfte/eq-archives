The zone I made the most money in giving rezzes was Rathe Mountains
while hunting Hill Giants. Most giant hunters have money, thanks to the
generous nature of the giants. And it's a long walk for anyone, unless
they've bound themself in the Arena or Grobb, and binders there are hard
to come by.

I go /role when working on tradeskills. I find if I just hang around
freeport, I get lots of tells asking me to come wherever and rez.
Sometimes transport is offered. If I have nothing better to do, I'll
take the transport offered and go, but that's rare.

The most anoying zone is Oasis. I have to tell people I'm not rezzing
anyone under 25. For the time it takes me to med up after a rez, they
could have gotten that XP back already. And I'm in Oasis to kill sand
giants- for my own XP. Nobody in Oasis has offered me more than 10pp for
a rez, so it's not worth it to me.

Currently hunting in the City of Mist. I suppose I could hassle the
higher level clerics for rezzes, because there is always at least one in
zone. But I'm not going to.
