The other posts were a bit encumbered.

I never had problems with the greedy Druids issue, farming and kiting
etc...I always pay 30pp or more for a port as it is a great help in my
journeys.

Until now.

Verant has enabled the 8th Prayer Shawl. One ingredient for this is Velium
Hound Fur.

Not a problem you would think. Just go to WW and kill some until you get the
fur you need?

No, because the once empty zone is now full of kiting druids killing (and
KSing) Velium Hounds and trying to charge people doing the quest 1kpp per
bit of fur.

Yup, you need a certain mentality to be a druid and I am glad I am not that
way inclined.

Same bastards even expect me to give them KEI for a sow.... Bollox!
