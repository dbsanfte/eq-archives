I'm still using my Sword Of Pain at 60.  Great little blade...

Sword of Pain
MAGIC ITEM  NO DROP
Slot: PRIMARY
Skill: 1H Slashing  Atk Delay: 25
DMG: 19  AC: 10
MANA: +50
Effect: Grim Aura (Must Equip. Casting Time: Instant)
WT:  5.0    Size: MEDIUM
Class: SHD
Race: HUM ERU DEF TRL OGR GNM IKS


Relatively easy to get in Velk's.  Raid buffed and hasted all you see is a
constant stream of 100+ hits.  The instant click Grim Aura is nice too.
