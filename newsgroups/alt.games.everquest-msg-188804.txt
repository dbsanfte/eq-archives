Coterie/Coterie General armor as a minimum and at the very least a couple
Polished Steel or better Ulaks, the Shissar Ulaks are nice, or you can get
into some extreme Katar's for not too much.

Starting out with some nice Velium-based hitpoint or hitpoint/mana jewellery
is good also, I threw about +180 hp on a beastlord for my 7 year old and she
has little trouble sailing along happily beating everything in her path to a
pulp.

Keep lots of cash ready for spells :)
