    Well, they kept saying it was a completely new graphics engine with SoL.
I'm sure part of the problem is that they had to maintain backwards
compatibility with old zones and the like, but still. I mean it's just
really really bad. Just go into a thick forest in Anarchy Online or Dark Age
of Camelot and you hardly slow down at all. Yet, you go into Luclin and go
through Dawnshroud or Twilight, while not looking better, runs worse. Just
strange is all.
