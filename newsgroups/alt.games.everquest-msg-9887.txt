:>Hmmmm dunnow if +16AC and +200HP will make that much of a difference at

:     You're actually talking 25 or so AC net - the 16 is raw. And if the
: things you fight at level 38 hit for 200 a pop AVERAGE, then maybe you
: should try hunting somewhere else. ;-)

That assumes that a 38 Lvl enchanter, (the original poster), has 1K HP.
I know my 36 Lvl enchanter has nowhere close to that. 

:>And giving up what is in those slots....

:     Will never be that important. Mana regain rate is much more important
: than raw mana pool size. Especially as the ENCH hits higher levels and gets
: ToT, the wonder spell. The JC set does give 50 total MANA, too.

I don't have int gear in those slots, I have charisma gear. Not sure
what happens at high levels, maybe better charisma gear is available, or
better charisma spells, or both and enchanters start beefing up their AC,
would be nice to be able to do. I do try to maximize my AC when I can.
