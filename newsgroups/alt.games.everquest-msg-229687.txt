Sadly, I'm not a little boy any more, but I do have the heart of a small 
boy.  (gratuitous setup for a Robert Block joke)

New posters appear in AGE every now and then.  They may not be aware 
that AGE is not a top posting newsgroup.

Common advice to all people new to the newsgroup scene is to read a 
given group for a while before posting in order to learn what the 
conventions of the group are.

However, some people don't bother doing this, or aren't aware of such 
general practice.

So, when someone top posts, I (and several other regulars) will very 
likely jump in with a quick note that draws attention to the fact that 
they aren't following local convention, for two reasons.  1) in case 
they simply aren't aware, didn't pay attention, and missed the normal 
practice.  2) so that other people reading the newsgroup won't think 
"ah, some people top post, others don't, apparantly there is no norm 
here".

Some groups top post, others don't, each newsgroup has its own local 
customs and practices.

When in rome, do as the romans do.

I could go into the why's and wherefores of whats better about bottom 
posting, but its been done.  And to be honest, I can see (although 
dubiously) whats better about top posting, too.  (just as I can see why 
early HP calculators used "reverse polish notation," easier to code and 
works just as well when you get used to it).  But whats really bad is 
when threads run to a combination of top, bottom, and (the real 
convention of the newsgroup) contextual (which is to say, posting in the 
middle, response to each point under the part where the point is made, 
with liberal snipping of things you aren't responding to) posting: an 
unadulturated mess.

If you could somehow convince every poster here to switch to top 
posting, it wouldn't be so bad.  But since 90% contextual post, and half 
the remainder bottom post, it makes a lot more sense to try and persuade 
the 5% who top post to switch over to the norm, Even if you think top 
posting is a bit better in the long run.

Killfiling the few who can't be persuaded to change helps a bit... but 
only a bit, as some people who don't top post themselves won't KF them, 
and will respond to them so I'll still see the mess, in fact the top 
post itself won't be as bad as the combination of top post and 
contextual post I'll actually be looking at... except where people go to 
the trouble of "fixing" the top posting by moving it down to the bottom, 
or snipping out whatever the top poster replied to.

Splendid
