Well....

I used Ethereal Rings of Metal to get my smithing skill up to 212 raw.  With
my Hammer of the Ironfrost (15% smithing modifier), that worked out to be
about 243 adjusted skill.

I had planned to go back to Shadowscream until my adjusted smithing was in
the 250 range.  But then someone in the Bazaar advertised for the skills of
a GM smith, and I replied.  We went down to Qeynos together, and she fed me
all the ingredient for a Fierce Heraldic Breastplate.  I assembled them, hit
combine - and succeeded.  I tried another FH BP - and succeeded again.  I
succeeded on everything she wanted me to try except two FH Greaves.  A very
satisfying session for us both.  I kept one of the FH BP's as a fee and sold
it a couple days later for 30K.

I never went back to Shadowscream.  I've gone from 212 raw / 243 adjusted to
223 raw / 255+ adjusted doing Heraldic combines, and made a pretty good
living at it.  I now have 120K in the bank that I honestly don't know what
to do with - I'm thinking of buying a lizard mount, although it's hard to
justify the cost just so I can get to raids faster.

I now know that I got pretty lucky with the Random Number Generator.  A
couple weeks later she wanted me to do another series of combines for her,
and I agreed.  I failed the first eight combines I tried before succeeding
on the last three.  Man, that was embarrassing to fail time and time again.

Overall, I think I succeeded about sixty percent of the time to begin with,
and the rate's been climbing.  I think I succeed about seventy-five percent
of the time now - I'm currently on a streak of six successful combines in a
row.  Those aren't really based on any hard numbers, just my guess on how
I've been doing.  It feels right.

People on my server are dying for a DE GM smith; I think you'll have a
pretty good market once you get there, because GM DE smiths seem to be rare.

Make sure to get a Geerlok Automated Hammer, which will add 5% to your
smithing and cost maybe 100pp in the bazaar.  With a hammer, I'd shoot for a
raw skill of 230 before moving on to DE cultural.

Thanks.  =)  I certainly enjoy writing them.
