Well, that's certainly unknown.  Players are forced out of hunting
areas -- at least for purposes of earning XP -- soon after starting
EQ and continuing on until they hit 50+.  At that range, they stopped
moving.  Not because they "shouldn't" or because there weren't places
to go, but because it's safer and easier to hunt there.

IMO, it's "wrong" for someone to make it to Velks at level 50 and
stay there until 60.100 or more.  Just like every other progression
in the game, you stay a few levels, maybe five or six at the most,
and then move on.  They're applying the same logic and requirements
to level 55+ as they are to level 5's.  What's wrong with that?
