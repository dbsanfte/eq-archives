I see everyone downing the wizard for not evacing.  Well, maybe it was 
his first time there.  With only 8 spells to have memmed it sometimes 
takes a while for me to figure out what spells I need to keep memmed.  I 
don't keep succor memmed all the time, I don't have room for it. 
Besides, the only times succor could have helped me, I never have enough 
mana to cast it, I solo too much, hehe.
Quick check for the low level evac--- it's a level 18 luclin spell. If 
the wiz don't check the sites for what spells he can have, he may not 
even have it.  No other spells at that level, it's easy to forget about. 
  I know there are a few druids who don't know about 'lesser succor'.
