    In cazic thule you can stand in certain places and nuke mobs to death
without ever being in any danger of dying . Certain blue to 60th gypsies
just stand still and take it if you nuke or use a bow at extreme range .
Certain guards can not hit you if you are standing on a wall . These are
exploits since you gain a tangible benefit at NO risk .
    In karnors castle there is a place where you can hop hop in the water
and back into the castle and make every mob move through the castle to get
to you . Not only can you thus train every mob around clearing out the pcs
quickly , you also cannot be killed and have enough time to retreat after
doing it . This is an exploited pathing bug that matters.
    Conquest FAILED which means that not only was there risk there was
plenty of it .
