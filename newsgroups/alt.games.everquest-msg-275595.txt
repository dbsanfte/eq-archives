Unless you go out of your way to find craptastic hardware, and/or 
install it with your microwave and ham radio between the base station 
and workstation you'll be just fine.

Bottom line: it works fine. Its still much faster than your cable/dsl/ 
or dialup connection, so it really makes near zero difference. If it 
drops connection more than regular ethernet youve probably accidently 
connected to your neighbors base station accross the street.
