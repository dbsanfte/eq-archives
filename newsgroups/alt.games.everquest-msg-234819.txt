Again, copyrigt has nothing to do with it...

Its intellectual property. And the argument would be whether or not
the player has a vested interest in said IP. Quite a few legal opinons
says "Yes the player does have a  vested and tangible interest", and
that changes things into a whole new ball game. 

Also, Sony says it makes no warranties, neither expressed nor implied
in the product. However, many states disallow these types of
exclusions. So the EULA isn't nearly as rock solid as you may think. 

Seriously, pay attention to Tim and Charles' discussion below, you
might learn something...
