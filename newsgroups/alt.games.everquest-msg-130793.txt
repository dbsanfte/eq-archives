No.  What you are failing to do is distinguish between a 
legitimate "target" and a legitimate *attack.*

For instance, you make a great deal of the fact that the
Liberty was a Naval vessel.  But, in fact, being a military
vessel is *neither* sufficient nor necessary to morally justify
an attack upon it.  That it is not necessary is illustrated
by the fact that it is acceptable to attack merchant ships 
supplying the enemy.  That it is not sufficient *should* be
obvious by inspection, but let me use one simple example.

Let us assume a US Naval vessel is en route from Norfolk to
Qatar and comes across a UK destroyer.  The US Naval vessel
decides, just for shits and giggles, to sink the destroyer and
kill all survivors.  Aha! You say.  This is perfectly OK.
After all the UK vessel is a military vessel and thus a
military target.

Similarly the theoretical capability of causing threat is
not an excuse, as you try to posit in your second point.  There
is no evidence that the Liberty *was* sharing information with
anyone, the Israelis made no suggestion that they were.  Thus,
no such actions were being taken by the US.  In other words,
there was *no* hostile activities being taken by the US
vessel.

Finally, the fact that Pearl Harbor was a legitimate target
in war does not mean that the way the attack was done was
legitimate.  Once again, you fail to distinguish between
a legitimate target and a legitimate act.  Expediency does
not excuse every atrocity.


>War sucks, no doubt about that.

Yes, it does.  And recognizing this is not an excuse for 
atrocity.

I can understand why Stalin killed 25 million kulaks.  That
does not constitute a justification.  The fact is that there
are rules for engagement which are generally agreed upon by
nations.  Israel did not abide by those.  Israel did not, for
instance, tell the US not to put a ship in those waters.  Israel
did not tell the US that such ships were liable for interdiction.
Israel could have demanded that neutral ships leave the area.
Israel did not do this.

And, even if the original attack were justified, there is *no*
justification for attempting to massacre *every single survivor.*
You can't hide behind "legitimate military target" for that.

And this excuses the attempt to murder *every survivor?*  No.
And you are wrong.  It was not a legitimate target.  Had Israel
told the US not to enter the region and the US done so, then
it would have been, though the gross attempt at mass murder
would still have not been justified.  However, Israel did not
do that.  The US was well within all international rights to
be in international waters there.

In fact, we were not in a "war zone."  We were in international waters
not in an area involved in the conflict.  By your reasoning, the Israelis
would also have been "justified" in bombing Laurel, Maryland because
we intercept transmissions there. The fact is that we were 
noncombatants not involved in the conflict.  That the Israelis
found it expedient to attack a noncombatant and murder the survivors
does not make it justified.
