/nod -- nor do I understand their reasoning...  I'm *very* tolerant
of various viewpoints and I have been known to enjoy many a non-
politically correct joke, but these radicals are just way beyond
anything that logic can explain.  They are acting on pure fear
and hatred with NO logic whatsoever, or else they'd see the irony
in their "religous crusade" and give it up.

I feel sorry for the people "over there" who refuse to think for
themselves and instead accept the preachings of a religious
fanatic as truth.

As corny as it sounds, I look forward to the day when I can travel
the world and see the various cultures and enjoy their differences
without worrying about getting killed simply because I come from
the United States.  :^(
