Were 1 mob before Mata Muram (2 guilds are at him so far that I know) so I
can't give you specifics.
You can read Lucy data as good as me, 45 second recast, unresistable,
unavoidable, single target.
What Lucy doesn't tell you if its cast on the MT (current agro person) or if
its a random target AE.  There are many targeted AE's which will randomly
hit any one person on the agro list, without regard for their actual
position on the agro list.

Doubling the chain isnt really a viable solution.  I don't know what he hits
for, but Id start out with a chain of 6 clerics (the default). Leaves 1-2
spares for DI (essential), ramp healing (essential), spam healing, rezzing,
rebuffing.

12 clerics in a raid isnt really seen anymore, and if every single cleric
was in the chain, people would just have to break off it to cast DI/rez so
it wouldnt be a particularly stable chain.
