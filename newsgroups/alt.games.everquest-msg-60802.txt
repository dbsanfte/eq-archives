Necro snare is limited to the primary mob, for exactly the reason
you think it is better... it is a DOT.  Any mob which is DOT'd
cannot be mezed.  Even on the primary mob this is a risk,
arrival of a higher level or more MR mob may require switching
primary target midstream, and any DOT makes the mezing
of the former primary impossible.

As you level up, Mez becomes one of the most important
effects in the arsenal of most parties, and you very often
cannot afford to mess with it in any way, even by removing
an obviously primary mob from the potential Mez list.

Also, DOTs lose a good deal of efficiency in groups, when
the mob dies before the spell runs out that means a lower
damage per mana ratio.  While your darkness may seem
more efficient than a snare and a nuke, if it lasts only
half duration, this can substantially affect that ratio.

Pulling with darkness line also lessens the effect, as while
the mob is moving towards you it does only 2/3rd damage
per tic.

Since you never want a mob to lose snare just as it starts
running, you inevitably lose several tics of DOT when the
mob dies... sometimes a -lot- of them, if the first darkness
has run out.

Necro snare is, under normal circumstances, a distant
secondary option to druid/ranger/wizard snare.  Can be used
in a pinch, can even be more effective in limited circumstances
than regular snare... but in general it is not the prefered snare.
