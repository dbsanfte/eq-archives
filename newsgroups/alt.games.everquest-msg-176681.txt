: Not within EQ.  As mentioned before, you can find some way of
: holding the key for the hotbutton down.

I bought a belkin N50 gamepad and set it up to activate a hot key every so
many seconds.  You can use it macro mode to make it work as an on / off
switch hit it once and it keeps doing it until you hit the button again.

If you have a Fry's electronics around you they have them for under $30.
Not to mention that they are nice for other games.
