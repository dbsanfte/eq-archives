This is a good response... I had certainly forgotten about the slowing
part, even tho I do the tash-slow routine on every mob when I play.
I'm happy with my chanter, just was getting a little worried seeing
all these high-level chanter complaints.  

What I do notice more and more is the overlap with other casters.  For
example, I normally group with a bard who is a superb puller, so it's
pretty rare that I have multiples to mez.  If you add in a shammy
doing slow, there really isn't anything for me to do but tash and act
like an underpowered wizard with blast.  So a lot just depends on the
group composition.

Fortunately the people I play with regularly are very laid back and
more concerned about us getting together than having "the perfect
group".
