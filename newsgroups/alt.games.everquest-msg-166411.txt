   The SF Weekly's column by Matt Smith in the Dec 3 issue points out 
   that there may be some information that John M. and Linda Poindexter 
   of 10 Barrington Fare, Rockville, MD, 20850, may be missing in their 
   pursuit of total information awareness.  He suggests that people with 
   information to offer should phone +1 301 424 6613 to speak with that 
   corrupt official and his wife.  Neighbors Thomas E. Maxwell, 67, at 8 
   Barringon Fare (+1 301 251 1326), James F. Galvin, 56, at 12 (+1 301 
   424 0089), and Sherrill V. Stant (nee Knight) at 6, may also lack some 
   information that would be valuable to them in making decisions -- 
   decisions that could affect the basic civil rights of every American. 

   Some people are suspicious that the degenerate Poindexter's Total 
   Information Awareness system will be used to harass and track the 
   activities of people who some significant fraction of society disagree 
   with.  They fear a replacement of today's general tolerance (and 
   official blindness to one's Bill-of-Rights-protected activities such 
   as speech and association), with specific harassment of those whose 
   names pop up in the database.  Such harassment of people who are not 
   reasonably suspected of criminal activity would destroy much of value 
   in our society, such as the presumption of innocence and the "live and 
   let live" philosophy that encourages diversity.  Offering dissidents 
   "a death of a thousand cuts" by constantly harassing them and denying 
   them the privileges of ordinary life would be far worse than charging 
   them with a (bogus) crime, which they could clear up merely by 
   demonstrating their innocence in court. 

   It would be good to have an early public demonstration of just how bad 
   life could become for such targeted citizens.  While ratfink's system 
   is probably not working yet, and a large part of it is classified, 
   much of it can be manually simulated for demonstration purposes. 
   Public records can be manually searched and then posted to the net by 
   people who happen to be looking there for something else.  Many 
   Internet public records search sites also exist; try searching for 
   "People finder".  (Matt Smith at matt.smith@sfweekly.com has offered 
   to "publish anything that readers can convincingly claim to have 
   obtained legally".)  Photographs and videos of the target, their 
   house, car, family, and associates, can be made and circulated to 
   demonstrate facial recognition techniques. 

   Employees at various businesses and organizations such as airlines, 
   credit card authorizers, rental-car agencies, shops, gyms, schools, 
   tollbooths, garbage services, banks, taxis, honest civil servants and 
   police officers, and restaurants could demonstrate denial of service 
   to such targeted people.  A simple "We won't serve YOUR KIND OF 
   PEOPLE" would do, as was practiced on black people for many decades. 
   More subtle forms of denial of service are possible, such as "You've 
   been 'randomly' selected as a security risk, I'll have to insist that 
   [some degrading thing happen to you]".  Or merely, "I can't seem to 
   get this credit card to work, sir, and those twenties certainly look 
   counterfeit to me." 

   Those with access to DMV and criminal records databases, credit card 
   records, telephone bills, tax records, birth and death and marriage 
   records, medical records, and similar personally identifiable 
   databases could combine their information publicly to assist in the 
   demonstration.  This is how TIA is intended to work -- the government 
   would get privileged access to all these databases, access that the 
   rest of us do not normally have.  But some of us have access to 
   various of these databases today, and can demonstrate how the TIA 
   system might work. 

   People who associated closely with such a targeted individual, such as 
   their families, relatives, friends, neighbors, protective secret 
   service agents, and business associates, might find themselves swept 
   up in the information dragnet.  Such a demonstration would graphically 
   reveal the societal dangers of deploying such systems on a wide scale 
   against a large number of citizens -- preferably early enough that 
   such a deployment could be prevented, rather than reversed after major 
   harm was caused. 

   Even if some of the information that people end up revealing or using 
   about such targeted scumbags is incorrect, such a public demonstration 
   would highlight the damaging effects that incorrect database 
   information can have on innocent peoples' lives, when used to target 
   them for harassment without due process of law.  When this happens to 
   innocents under classified or secret systems such as the No-Fly lists, 
   the public seldom finds out about it. 

   All in all I think such a demonstration would be highly educational, 
   as well as newsworthy and entertaining.
