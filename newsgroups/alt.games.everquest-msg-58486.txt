Why are all those posts about wis being only a mana source? The question was
'which is better'. Now, I'm not sure, but wis is also what is involved in
lerning your skills, not? For a caster I'd always go with more wis (or int
for int casters), if the mana outcome is about the same as a mana item, since
you gain this added plus in learning skills.
