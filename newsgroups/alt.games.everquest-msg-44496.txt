You might also check out the quest for the Short Sword of Morin,  I'm not
sure about the stats on it, but if you can get someone to kill the Ghoul
Messenger in WK (I think it's around 30th level), you can then give the note
it drops to Morin (Shadowbane?) in Kithicor Forest (don't go in there at
night) and get the sword, I believe it's a decent weapon but again,  I can't
remember the stats off the top of my head.
