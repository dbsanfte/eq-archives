In the best trials group I was in - we had a shaman do exactly this.  She
seemed to handle it well.  The thing we lacked was one more really good
damage class.  If I could have found one more 61 mage with his 61 pet and
a horse - I think we could have made it - we were so close so many times.

Also, I had ABYSMAL luck with banishment - just one lucky turn from the
RNG might have gotten me through also.
