An item is "trivial" when it no longer gives you skill-up potential. These
are generally known values, based on experimentation, references, etc.

My question is: when can you first successfully attempt a combine? I've
heard comments to the effect that "You need to be at least 220 skill to
attempt that combine". Is there a formula based on the skill level and the
trivial level? If I am at 180 skill and I set my sights on something that is
240 trivial in order to raise my skills (irrespective of failure issues),
will that work? How can I know?
