Oh it doesnt compare to past guild outings.. the worst being planes bosses.
2-3 hour clearing of PoF,  CT inc, "Serverwide broadast: All servers coming
down immediatly for maintenance. Expected downtime 10 minutes. Please log
out immediatly!"

Oh and PoG.. how could I forget PoG!  Twice we got screwed with this...
average 8 hours clearing the Plane including all her named guardians (pog is
the absofuckinglutely worst zone in EQ to clear just for Tunare loot)
Im sure it could be cleared faster but people lose focus (hell, i wonder
why).. average clearing time is 9-10 hours.. add 30mins onto that should we
wipe on anything..  <3 that zone

Move to engage Tunare.. and shes poofed.  That made even the most laid back
and composed people in the guild to say FUCKING VERANT!!!    !*&*(&

She died to us again last night.. its some comfort seeing her corpse lay on
the ground, ugly green bish!  Loot kinda blew tho :(
