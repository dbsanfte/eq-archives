So Theoretically speaking (Not that anyone would want to do this) You
could go to a plane die, and then death loop yourself somehow, down to
level 6 and get rezzed to the planes, and be a level 6 running around up
there (well til you encountered your first mob which kills you with one
hit that is)?

For the cat is cryptic, and close to Aegyptus, and bearer of tales from
forgotten cities in Meroï¿½ and Ophir. He is the kin of the jungle's
lords, and
        heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister Africa. The Sphinx is
his cousin, and he speaks her language; but he is more ancient than the
Sphinx, and
        remembers that which she hath forgotten.
