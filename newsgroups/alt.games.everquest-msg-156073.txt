I do agree, in principle, but it -is- quite easy to miss things in 
patch messages even if you -do- read them.

And on the blue bar thing... I'm not entirely sure, because I can't 
remember how long ago it was and the patch archives only go back to 
April...  But wasn't the blue bar implemented a week or two before they 
actually bothered to mention it in a patch message?  I remember being 
rather baffled by it myself at first.
