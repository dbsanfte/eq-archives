Careful, or this thread will derail into a world-class bitch session.  You can make some
of the people happy some of the time........

........but some of the people will never be happy, period.

>Could someone tell me if SOE actual take players opinions into account?

During the summer of 2004, SOE held a player/developer summit, wherein they discussed the
direction of EQL at length and took suggestions for improving the game.  Many of those
player suggestions have since appeared in the gameworld, always clearly marked in the
relevant patch message.  In my experience, these customer-driven changes have typically
been positive enhancements.

(I do not know if the farming of opinions and suggestions is an ongoing process.)

SoE has established an official account on at least my class website, and that the owner
checks in occasionally with the community.  I can only assume (or !hope!) that the same
activity is taking place on other class websites.

Best regards,

Tim ==
