Well, crikes, I thought we *were* talking about present circumstances. I 
have no doubt that you could pose hypothetical scenarios in which I 
would be in complete agreement with you.

By the way, that's really a seperate issue - whether they should have 
charged us the additional amount or not - on which I actually agree with 
you. Once they decided to do so, I just have no problem with them 
charging it against my card, the card that I provided them for the very 
purpose of charging me for their services.

That not the same. The practice of serving said burger patty to a 
customer actually does them harm by introducing harmful germs and 
bacteria into their system.

I've not lost track of anything at all. You seem to be debating the 
hypothetical rather than the issue at hand. Sure, in a perfect world, 
they might not charge your card any amount without your expressed 
permission. However, in that same perfect world, everyone would promptly 
provide that permission or promptly pay the bill when it arrives. I see 
not reason to complicate *this particular process* by bothering with a 
bill or the mess of dealing with those who choose not to pay it. 
Insisting them do so is just being difficult for some unknown reason.

Also, for the record, I don't see this particular undercharge as a 
"billing error" that should to be eaten at all. Everyone was in 
agreement on the cost - the customer by virtue of their continued 
subscription. However, suddenly some customers are balking at paying it 
for some reason.

Well, that's where I see it as mere over-sensitivity to the subject. 
There is absolutely no harm in the method they chose.

Again, that's a poor analogy, as $2 hardly compares with the 
inconveniences and additional costs that could be incurred in your 
scenario.
