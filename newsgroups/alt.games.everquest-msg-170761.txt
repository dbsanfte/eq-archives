6 points in the "general" AA skills is required before you can learn "archetype"
(melee/priest/caster) skills, this earns you a "Baron" title.

At 56 you can begin putting points into "archetype" skills.  12 points in the "archetype" AA
is required before you can learn the class specific skills, this earns you another title, for
priest classes, this is "Venerable"

At 59 you can begin putting points into your class specific skills.  Some number of points put
in there earns you a class specific title, and I believe there are at least two of these for
each class, although I've never looked into it.

At 61 you can put points towards two more sorts of AA, but these points don't count for
titles, if you care about that.

You'll find many people take pride in their number of AA points earned, which makes a bit more
sense than the title system, since that doesn't really tell you anything about the post POP
era exp expenditure of the characters.   A 62 cleric with 70 AA may be more powerful (and
certainly has spent more time and energy working on exp) than a 65 cleric with 22 AA
