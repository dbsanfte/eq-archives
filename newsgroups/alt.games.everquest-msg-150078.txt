Actually, Verant nerfed that with their hatred of Half-Elves.  Since we
can't do anything cultural (but we can defend Tunare), I went into
fletching.  Of course, now there are cultural bows.... /rude verant.

Well, it seems like a good idea to have good Wis and Mana gear anyways
(though Paladins have been moved from a three-way tie for second best
healers at high levels to "about as insignificant as a ranger").  /rude

How much of an effect does this have?  With cheap trinkets, I was at 151
Dex.  At a trivial of 163, I was getting one skill up on a stack each of
Silver Tipped arrow ingrediants.  Is that typical?

Thanks for the warning, I'll keep an eye on that.
