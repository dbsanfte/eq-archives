What tells?  He never mentioned any tells?  Why do you keep putting words
into the original post that were not there?

I am not saying a /r hotkey is the best solution.  However, it could work
for what was described.  You then go off an add a bunch of things to the
original post and say a /r will not work because of those thing.  That is
incorrect because the original poster did not say anything other than three
tells over several minutes.  The hot button is then a nice solution, BUT,
like all hot buttons it will not work in every situation.

The /afk hot button does not work when you want to sit or stand because it
does not make you sit or stand.  So trying to equate afk and sitting or
standing is idiotic.  Your comments are slightly less idiotic.  You keep
going off on tangents and saying that the original poster meant this or that
when you simply do not have any information of that sort at all.
