}If you don't want it discussed here you should take it out of your
}signature.  This is a forum about Everquest - why do you have to drag your
}EQ-irrelevant bias and hate into it?

I see no hate here, and very little bias.  The only bias is in singling out 
'men' as opposed to 'men and women'.

If she had said 'Christianity has caused...' or any other specific religion, 
then maybe.  But one could argue in the 'atheistic Socialism/Communism' case, 
that even there, religion is the cause of the misery, in this case by its 
absence... Unless we want to argue about whether atheism is a religion.  
Having known some relatively fanatical atheists, I'd back that notion.

This is a very subjective and thought-provoking statement.  Exactly the kind 
of thing I like to see in a .sig.  There aren't good ways to quantify misery 
(although certain psychological scales for stress measurement may be 
relevant...) and it's very hard to determine for any particular misery 
exactly how attributable to religion it is, or how much of it is so 
attributable.
