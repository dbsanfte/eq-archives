100pp is not enough to buy all your level 24 spells,
so you'll want to get these first:

Skin Like Steel  (upgrade to Skin like Stone)
Creeping Crud    (upgrade to Stinging Swarm)
Wolf Form  (speed like SoW but much longer duration, and ATK boost)


You'll probably also want your personal teleports:

Ring of Feerott
Ring of Lavastorm
Ring of Ro
Ring of Steamfont


The other spells are less important:

Dismiss Summoned is a nice spell if/when you need to fight
elementals, and Resist Fire is certainly useful.

When I was playing a druid I never used Tremor, or Sunbeam, or
Pogonip either, for that matter, so I can't tell you if they
are worthwhile.  But, Spirit of Cheetah is of such short duration
that it's *nearly* useless, and Charm Animals just isn't very
effective; so I wouldn't waste money on these until you're flush
with cash and extremely bored.  ;-)
