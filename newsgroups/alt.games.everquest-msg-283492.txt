Firebolt of Tallon is a Fire based, Evocation DD which requires LOS.
Sun Vortex is a Fire based, Conjuration DD which does not.
So, depending on what you spec'd in, Fbolt or Sun Vortex may be more 
efficient.
Also, Ornate and Elemental Gloves have a focus effect that reduces the mana 
cost of Sun Vortex significantly.
