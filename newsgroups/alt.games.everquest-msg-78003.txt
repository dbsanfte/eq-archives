When activating the skill a window pops up (tracking window) that lists
nearby mobs, npc's and PC's in their respective consider colours.
The range of what shows up (ie. how far away things listed in the window can
be) is defined by you skill-level in tracking.
If range is calculated straight off of skill or is 'rolled' every time i do
not know, someone else might fill that in.

If you choose one entry in the list and press the TRACK button in the
window, the window closes and you will get a text message every few secons
telling you where in relation to where you are that the chosen track object
is in relation to you, See this example from my lvl 8 Ranger:


[Sun Jan 06 15:06:30 2002] You begin tracking Keian.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:30 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:31 2002] Keian tells you, 'Waiting at felwithe bank'
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:32 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:34 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:36 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:38 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:40 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:42 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:43 2002] You told Keian, 'Yep got you on tracking ))'
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:44 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:46 2002] You fail to locate any food nearby.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:46 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:48 2002] Keian is ahead and to the left.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:50 2002] Keian is to the left.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:52 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:54 2002] Keian is to the right.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:56 2002] Keian is straight ahead.
[Sun Jan 06 15:06:58 2002] Keian is ahead and to the right.
[Sun Jan 06 15:07:00 2002] Keian is ahead and to the right.
[Sun Jan 06 15:07:02 2002] Keian is behind and to the left.
[Sun Jan 06 15:07:04 2002] Keian is to the left.
[Sun Jan 06 15:07:06 2002] Keian is ahead and to the left.
[Sun Jan 06 15:07:08 2002] Keian is ahead and to the left.
[Sun Jan 06 15:07:09 2002] Banker Tintal tells you, 'Welcome to my bank!'
[Sun Jan 06 15:07:10 2002] Keian is ahead and to the left.

And if you instead keep the window up and wait for the button to cycle
(become active again) the next press of the button will update the window
with present surroundings, if you have moved or if mobs have moved or gotten
killed or new ones spawned.
