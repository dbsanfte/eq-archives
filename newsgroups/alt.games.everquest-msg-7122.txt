Well, don't know about any new recipes. A bard I know was livid about
his charm song being broken by the patch, and my computer froze up
when I camped to desktop (don't know if that was patch related)
However, there's one unannounced change I really liked: large
tailoring kits are now TEN slot :) (First I wondered if I'd somehow
taken my cultural kit from the bank, then I flipped out :) )
