  Yes, you get instanced versions.  My group
of four level 70's just did an Unrest mission.
(The fact that a group of four non-ubers could
easily complete the mission should give you an
idea of the difficulty).  Was fun, but I doubt the
average high level player will find it rewarding
enough to do a second time.
