This can only be done if the ORIGINAL credit card number on the origin
account matches the one on the destination account, IIRC. It's a
safeguard against doing exactly what you're talking about. Remember,
they don't approve of transferring accounts and, as such, they're not
going to hand you any "securities" to protect from getting ripped off
by someone selling you an account.
