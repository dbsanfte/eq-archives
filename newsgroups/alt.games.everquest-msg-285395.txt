I have access to Allakhazam like most people, and so I can check level
ranges as well as the next guy.

But what I want is some suggestions on FUN zones where a group of 3 to
6 casters (necro's and mages)  in the high teens can go and just have
fun.  Maybe some loot and item drops (we're minimally bazaar geared)
but that's not the focus, nor is XP.

Old timers will recall some of the glory days of BlackBurrow and SolA,
where trains were just part of life but damn they were fun to watch.
And if you could avoid them then all the better.

I realize the days of zone-wide trains are probably gone but it get's
my concept of fun across (I think).  We're about fun, not grinding.

So what's fun these days? 

Thanks.
