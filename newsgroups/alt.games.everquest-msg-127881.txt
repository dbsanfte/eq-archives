 You're still going to run into plenty of "idiots" on Test, however because
there are simply many less people usually playing on Test you won't see as
many.

 What you will see on Test is an agonising amount of crashes, lots of times 
the server just isn't up (in the last week it's been down about 5 entire 
days), XP and item rollbacks, times when entire populations from 24 "live"
servers invade to see the latest new thingie and ultimately crash the Test 
server and many, many versions that don't work quite right. You will have 
a very tough row to hoe leveling up a character on Test if you ask me.
