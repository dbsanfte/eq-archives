Heh. I can't even get the casing on my computer to fit back on
properly; I think it got bent when we put in my new RAM or something.

The next one I buy will do just that.

Heh. I did try turning the TV off yesterday, and the stereo (tiny
thing, no big speakers or anything) and still got the flickers.
However, while they were really really bad the first half hour I
played last night, they went away for the last three hours, and I've
only seen one tiny flicker all afternoon, with the TV on. I've never
seen this before in two years with this tin can, and I'm beginning to
wonder if it suffered from sunspots or something :)

(I have to have the TV or stereo on while I play to distract me from
the sound of the fan in my computer. It bugs me to the extent that
I've had to cover the tower with a folded up blanket. Feel free to run
away screaming :) )
