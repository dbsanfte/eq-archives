Subject: A guide falsely reported me

I have a question, I got falsely reported by a guide. I was curious, how do i
get this false report off my record?

The guide was Guide Fooz on the Tholuxe Paells Server (so bug him if you want
hehe, that would teach him a lesson).

What happened is i got disconnected just as i was about to zone, and my
charecter got killed. So i petitioned to get my experience back, and after i
explained my problem he said i couldnt get my exp back. i asked why and he said
because its not policy blah blah so i asked why isnt it policy, and he said
because i volunteerily logged out of the game.

So at that point, i asked him if he was stupid or something, because anyone
would remember what i said 2 minutes ago and he didnt answer. so i figuered he
was a retard and i said you better not be a retard cuz i hate retards.

Then he said something like "guide harassment is against policy and youre being
reported for harassing a guide" . he never once asked me to go away so i didnt
harass him and i petitioned another guide and told him/her about the situation
and they said they would fix it, but how do i know or sure that this thing is
off my record for the guide faslely reporting me?

Thank u
