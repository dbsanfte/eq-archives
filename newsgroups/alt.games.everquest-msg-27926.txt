Dwarven cultural armor. Imbued enchanted version. Sadly, I don't know
any enchanters high enough to emchant brellium, so I may have to make do
with just the Imbued version.

Hey Rosewhite, anyone in your guild willing to enchant Brellium? May I
send you a tell in game to make arrangements with one if there is? I
won't be on this weekend, but maybe I can make arrangements Wednesday or
Thursday, or when I get back from vacation. (Obviously, I'd pay whatever
they deemed reasonable for their time and mana, and I will supply the
Brellium. Can even arrange an alt to meet them at Lavastorm/Nektolous
border if they need help getting the spell).

Smithing is up to 151, and we've been killing HG in the Bank of Rathe,
so I should be able to afford to get up there to at least try with a
reasonable rate of success. I hope. The rubies are going to be painful,
even with my enchanting mule buying them- 133pp each. Haven't priced the
brellium, and finding Lavarocks is going to be a pain.

But for a dwarven cleric, these are worth it:
