What about a sparkiling shortsword ? They rot all the time . They require
elemental plane flags but not time . 18/18 is a damn fine weapon for a
ranger of that level for when they are not using a buyable elemental bow.

I really dont feel for rangers all that much.While they are certainly not
nearly as powerfull as the top 3 (cleric, bard ,beastlord ) they come in
much nearer the top of balance rather than the bottom.
