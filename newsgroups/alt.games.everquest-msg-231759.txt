Sounds like they should have put street lights in, and made the road 
safer. If everybody excessively speeds on a road for 3 years straight 
that's probably a sign that the speed limit is set too low, not a sign 
that all the drivers in the city are crooks.

Ticketing people on an "empty road" "during the day" every sunday for 3 
years looks to me like cops taking advantage of a stupid situation. I'd 
rather see the town fix the problem, instead of treating it like a tollway.
