I started a barb shammy a week ago and it's time for me to hunt mammy
calfs for the hides.  I spent made a couple of trips to the ramp and
spent an hour or so each time searching.  The adventure camp was empty
most of the time too.  I only saw 1 mammy, a couple of troopers and 1
leopard.  There was nothing at the ramp or across the river. Just
barren snow covered wastes.  Anyone know what happened to the hunting
grounds or where these guys are located now?
