Hi!
After not having much time to play I found some time again to replay my old
chars.
and I noticed somethign very strange. my pally who was level 33 was suddenly
22 and back at his old startig point.
Now grant you it has been a year since -I have been able to play again..

Does anybody have a clue as to what happend?
