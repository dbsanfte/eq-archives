Ive given up on it for now. Maybe ill come back at 62 or 63, but im just
getting way too many resists at 60. I could probably be 62 already if id
been xping instead of doing trials.
Anyway, the rocks are unmezzable, unslowable, unstunnable. Melees just have
to target them first while you mez the nemeses. Stay close to the melees so
you dont pong. Hope the RNG gives you a decent break.
Ive heard aoe is the best way to get through. We tried it and got through
the first wave, but lost a wiz. I was getting stuns resisted a lot (no
rocks). Maybe if I would hit them with winds of tashanian first (and
survive). /shrug
