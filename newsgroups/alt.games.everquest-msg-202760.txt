I still don't get how they divide up the experience because they don't
split it by the number of characters in group.  It's based on the
relative levels of the group members (I thought).  For example, with a
group made up of levels 10, 11, 12, 13, the level 10 would get
10/46ths, level 11 would get 11/46ths, 12 would get 12/46ths and 13
would get 13/46ths.  So it's not that everyone gets 1/4th of the
experience.  Everyone gets a proportional amount of experience based
on their relative level in the group.

Oh, wait! Maybe I do understand it.  If a 6th person joins, he'll get
his proportional level of experience, but the denominator will not
change.  But how do they figure out the demoniator?

For example, a group of level 10, 11, 12, 13, 14  would have a
denominator of 60.  Then if a level 20 joins, does that mean he gets
20/60ths of the experience?

But if the group was 11, 12, 13, 14, 20 to start with, the denominator
would be 70.  So then if the level 10 joins, would he get 10/70ths of
the experience?  That would be a worse deal than when he was in the
original group even though the same players are in the group.  Would
it matter how the group was formed?
