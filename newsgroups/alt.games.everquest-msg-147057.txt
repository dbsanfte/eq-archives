Story #1: you turned around to find one of your mobs beating on
someone.

Story #2: you claimed they were in a bunch when one turned to beat on
someone.

The inconsistency is how sure you were that they were in a bunch when
one started to beat on someone, rather than one of them leaving the
grouping. From yourr first story, you couldn't have known if it was or
not.
