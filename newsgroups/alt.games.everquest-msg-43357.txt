HA ! this assumes that the person in question does not really know what they
want . While this is actually true a depressing amount of the time , it is
not true for me :p

Eq isnt run as a reprensentative goverment either :( One where you actively
recruit the brightest and hardest working minds so that they can do the best
they can for you. I feel as if Eq is really run by Jim and Tammy baker or
maybe beavis and buthead :P
