    The original plan was for certain specific spells to drop in only
certain places. In some cases, that seems to be true - a group of mine in
Fungi King in Seb once got the same druid charm spell three times in a row
off the 'shrooms. Have you varied your hunting areas for post-54 spells, or
has it pretty much been Skyfire?

    If you had the pet, where exactly would YOU use it? They could ALL have
the pet and I'd never know. :P

    One of the changes to Chardok on Test is apparently an upping of the
55-58 spell drop rate deeper in. That might help people fill those spell
books.
