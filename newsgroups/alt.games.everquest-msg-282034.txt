  ...but you can see it from here.
  My account expires June of next year. At this point
it is very unlikely I will renew.
  (No, you can't have my stuff. I'll hold on to the account
in case something happens.)
  Saviours is on hiatus during the holidays. Several
important people have been lost recently, which may
bode ill for our fortunes in the new year. But even
if revived with new recruits, there just seems so little
I can do anymore. Adas has basically reached her limit;
there are no more really transformative AA's to get,
and really huge gear upgrades would require raids
Saviours will never be capable of. Open raids will still
be fun, but only to go places I haven't before, like
higher GoD zones.
  Then there's the collapse of the grouping game in
the era of monster missions. It's all fairy missions all
the time these days. Before that it was all Creator
missions. This is fine for earning AA's, but now I'm
looking to just sit back and enjoy a long term group
somewhere I don't usually go, like RSS. Few of these
are happening now.
  My alts were all created with the idea of providing
options in a rich grouping environment; if someone
needed a cleric or tank or puller I could provide one.
But now they seem so useless. I will play them for
the sheer fun of soloing them up a bit, developing
them through lower levels, up to 50. But they will not
be able to do anything with groups. It's very sad; I
had hoped to use some of them in Sebilis or Chardok.
  I will regret a lot of things missed: NToV, Vex Thal,
Veeshan's Peak, Ssra raids. I've basically missed the
boat on these places.
  WoW will be the future: my priests will be in high
demand, and a warlock will be useful in some places.
Look for me on alt.games.warcraft.
  Off to greener pastures...
