Only four?

I read them the first time when I was 10, I've read them at least 6 times
since.

Other choice selections at that age were ERBs Mars and Pelucidar series, EE
"Doc" Smith's Skylark and Lensmen series, Jack Williamson's Seetee books,
lots of Heinlein, and various John Campbell books.  Oh, and of course, L.
Sprague DeCamp's various Enchanter books.
