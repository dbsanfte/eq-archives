All of those things are pure 'softball' compared to what else
goes on in the business world.

You just hear about it more because Bill Gates and Microsoft are
the Presses current whipping boy. Before Microsoft came
along it was IBM and GM.

Many times I tell stories about my business to people and
they look at me like I just related a fairy tale about giants
and dragons to them. "That doesn't really go on in America does it?"
they say.

Try running a business sometime, or just read some business
newspapers.
