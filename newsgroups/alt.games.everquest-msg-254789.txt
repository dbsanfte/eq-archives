I tried this guy, and he is indeed a major wimp considering he's red to 
me.  His 420 point HT is attention getting, but after that its a long 
time before he's got me zoning out, and there's no panic about doing so, 
just duck into warrens.  My berserk is unfortunately fairly stupid, 
foolish, and clumsy, so he doesn't skill up fast, I got about 5 points 
per run... and a couple BW points each time I healed in the tunnel.

So there I was, happily drudging away on the guy, down to 10% hp for the 
fourth time and considering that its probably about time to zone again when

did you see this coming?



Harm touch refreshed, boom I'm dead!

Piercing skill is at 19, but I'm out some exp.  Which is easily 
replaced, but its embarassing!

I decided to wait a few levels till he's not so red anymore and then 
return.  So I killed him with my 2hs, just to show him he can't kick me 
around, and wandered off in search of adventure, xp, and loot... 
although honestly, is there loot at my level?
