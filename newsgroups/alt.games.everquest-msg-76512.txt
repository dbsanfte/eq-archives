Ten rules for fun, fast advancement in EQ.

1. Never beg, not for money, items, or powerleveling, nor other.
2. Kill stuff, loot everything, sell what you find, save your money,
upgrade your gear.
3. Learn to group early. It's a multiplayer game designed for you to
work with others towards common goals. You'll need to learn your role in
a group early on to do well.
4. Don't be an asshole and ignore those who are.
5. Listen to advice from advanced players, and learn to use various
online resources to research problems. (e.g. www.castersrealm.com and
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/   there are many, many others.)
6. Never beg, not for money, items, or powerleveling, nor other.
7. Never beg, not for money, items, or powerleveling, nor other.
8. Never beg, not for money, items, or powerleveling, nor other.
9. Never beg, not for money, items, or powerleveling, nor other.
10. Never beg, not for money, items, or powerleveling, nor other.
