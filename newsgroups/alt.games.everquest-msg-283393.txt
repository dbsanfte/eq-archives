One of the elements of the recent patch was an upgrade to the map system.

If you look at your map, one of the buttons on the left side says Group.

Push that button, and there's a blue X on the map at the present 
position of each of your group members.  Hover the cursor over an X, and 
you'll get the name of the member.

Despite it being mentioned in the patch notes, only one person in ten 
that I talked to about it had any idea it was even there, and even I 
didn't know about the name part; one of the people I told about it 
discoverd that part.

Its helpful in finding your party, no more "we're camping east" and so 
on, and its even more helpful in trying to tell someone how to get to 
you; you can actually guide them in and tell them when they've missed a 
turn or something.

Of course its only as good as your map, and isn't much good in a 
multilevel dungeon, since it doesn't give Z coordinate info at all, but 
still, handy.
