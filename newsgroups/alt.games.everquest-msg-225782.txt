I dont macro, i sit there and cramp my hand...but then i also read guild 
chat, and chat with friends.
Although with a 200 brewing, it would be great if they would make it 
possible for me to mass brew in stacks something that low to my skill.

Even if it was only in lots of 20 [1 stack finished product, however 
many individual stacks of ingredients] it would be fantastic.
aru
they were selling for 125 per coldain vel temper in bazaar on sol ro. i 
took mine off the market as i didnt want a reseller to buy my 
legitemately made tempers and padding their stolen tempers. when they 
are sold out, i will start selling again. until then, i am building my 
stock of tempers though the cod oil has been selling out fast recently=)
