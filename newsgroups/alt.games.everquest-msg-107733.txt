}Gee, honey, I thought you had a clue with Tiru- every time he dinged 29, 39,
}and 49, within5 seconds, someone sent me a tell "rez plz". Sigh.

Heh, I remember when I dinged 39, I already had my new spells, so I gated 
to ec and started scribing.  I just sat down when I got a tell, 'Excuse 
me, do you have the spell Distill Mana?' As it happened, I did, and was 
able to help make a fleeting quiver within minutes after scribing the 
thing.  I thought the odds I would ever use that spell were vanishingly 
slim. :)

And, in a happy coincidence, the two friends who were with the guy who 
wanted the quiver ended up being two of my bestest in game friends ever.
