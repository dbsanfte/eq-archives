This is the reason I was thinking raid experience wouldn't be the same
amont as group experience. Whats the point of six man groups, which
many if not all encounters are designed for (besides ubermobs) when
you can then make as many people in your group as you want.

I think if they *do* allow experience to be shared by an entire raid,
the experience won't actually amount to as much as it would for just
one group. In your example, perhaps everyone is only getting 1/70th
the experience.

Though its kinda sad to do it, it does make sense. However, I would be
just as happy if experience stays normal for a raid, as long as
everyone really does get experience, something we haven't seen yea or
nay for yet. :-)
