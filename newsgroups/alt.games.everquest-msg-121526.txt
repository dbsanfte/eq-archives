Actually, I'd expect most transfers to get tagged quickly.  I'd guess most
people who transfer do so to be with friends, and so probably get into their
friend's guild very quickly.

The thing to check is the equipment on the Ranger.  Character transfers are
naked except for spells, and so if the Ranger is a transfer, he should
mostly only have stuff his friends gave him, which will all obviously be
droppable.  If the Ranger has much in the way of NO DROP gear, he's probably
not a transfer.
