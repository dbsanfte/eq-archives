Cloak exist on the EQ character model, they tried cloaks during beta.
I red a post from a VI GD (Alan i think) who told they had to turn cloak
display to reduce the greedy 3d process. Few high level mobs have still
their cloack like Maestro.

2 post for similar requests :

Alan said :
With a game like EverQuest, where every item that you see needs to be an
actual 3D model (unlike other games where items are essentially flat
sprites), we have to keep the number of models as small as possible. Each
time you enter a zone the game loads up these models into your video memory.
There is only so much memory there for us to use, especially since we have
to stick to the system requirements for the game as it was released (at
least for basic EverQuest.). It was decided early on that some items
(cloaks, shoulder pads, etc.) just couldn't be displayed. Cloth items, it
was decided, wouldn't be displayed either, also for reasons of these very
same restrictions.
We don't like these restrictions any more than you do. But we just can't
display everything.
Fortunately, we have pushed the technology a bit, and with Velious we've
included more textures. Hopefully in the future we can push your machine
even further.

someon asked :
I would like there to be some no stat robes that could cover over your
regular armor that everyone could wear. I think it would be fun to just walk
around in a cloak as a warrior and have everyone blind to what race and
class you were.

Gordon answer :
Well the issue right now is the number of meshes that we have available.
Robes were only allocated to those races who could be casters to limit the
number of different graphics that could be displayed at any one time in
order to adhere to the system requirements.
We do have some new ideas going forward and you'll see a lot more
interesting things on the characters.
