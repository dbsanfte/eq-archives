Does it seem odd to anyone else that a spell having to do with Karana (the
Rainbringer, IIRC) stops rain? I know, I know: the last thing most people want
in-game is more rain, but from a purely RP standpoint wouldn't it make more
sense if Druids got a spell to make it rain? Then perhaps if they were Karana
worshippers they got some minor boost because they felt closer to their god
when it was raining, or some such?
