Yes, unfortunately I am flagged as a Ubisoft customer.  I got tricked into the 
free download of eq classic they offered a while back which made me a ubisoft 
customer.  I didn't find this out until I tried to order LDON online and found 
out that it wasn't offered to Ubisoft customers.  I had to order from an 
online store and wait for it to be delivered.  Still I don't see how this 
would prevent me from getting to the server selection screen.  As far as I 
know I connect the same way as other accounts.
