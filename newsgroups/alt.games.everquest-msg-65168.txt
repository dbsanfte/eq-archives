You need to add the following programs to the permissions list before
you play:

eqgame.exe	allow local/internet connect and server, changes often
everquest.exe	allow local/internet connect and server, changes often
_verquest.exe	allow local/internet connect, changes often


I recently had another related problem with ZoneAlarm where it
'forgot' permissions that I had granted. I emailed their tech support
and got the following answer which helped with my problem:

=========================

There may be a problem with your TrueVector service. ZoneAlarm is
dependent on its TrueVector service to function properly. You may need
to refresh the files associated with this service, especially after a
networking change, OS change, or ZoneAlarm update.

If the Configure panel is displaying TrueVector driver as loaded and
ZoneAlarm is still not functioning properly, it is possible that some
files have become corrupt. To repair this problem, please follow these
steps. Please note that this will remove your program permissions and
Local Zone settings (so you may want to make note of them), but
re-establishing them is a simple process;  you will be prompted again
for program access for all the applications that you use to access the
local network or Internet.

If any of the steps below does not apply to you, or you are unable to
perform the function listed, please continue to the next step.

1. Open the ZoneAlarm program, go to Configure panel, and make sure
the Load At Startup box is UNchecked.

2. Right-click on your taskbar, select Toolbars, and make sure that
the ZoneAlarm deskband is UNchecked as well (if it is checked, click
on it to uncheck it).

If you cannot highlight the Desk Band by right-clicking on the
toolbar, then highlighting Toolbars, try this: Click on the Configure
button from the ZoneAlarm/ZoneAlarm Pro panel, then look for the "Show
Shell Toolbar" checkbox -- make sure that this box is UNchecked.

3. Reboot. You should now have no ZoneAlarm processes running on your
system.

4. Open the Internet Logs directory (in 95/98/ME this will be
"c:\windows\internet logs", in NT and 2000 it will be
c:\winnt\internet logs), where you will find a file called "iamdb.rdb"
and a file named after your computer with the ".ldb" extension. Delete
both of these files.

5. Reboot your system.

6. You will need to start ZoneAlarm manually. (Click Start, Programs,
Zone Labs, ZoneAlarm). ZoneAlarm will start up again with a fresh
database. Each program should ask for access again if the files were
properly deleted.

7. Be sure to REcheck anything you unchecked earlier.

NOTE: If you received an error message upon deleting the files, the
original programs remain in the Programs list, or if the problem
persists after this, removing the files in Safe Mode will allow you to
delete the files properly.  If you need further help with this, please
reply to this email keeping all text intact as we do not archive
previous emails. 

ORIGINAL MESSAGE:
-----------------

<snip>

Issue:
ZoneAlarm 'forgets' permission settings for recently upgraded programs
(Pegasus Mail4, IE6, Everquest). My PC is set up with an Administrator
signon and a poweruser signon. Most of these programs were first
installed under the admin signon, and since upgraded by the poweruser.
Each time the pc is rebooted, the settings for these 3 apps revert to
'ask'. Once I give permission, it sticks for that session only. I have
tried removing the permission in the poweruser signon, changing to the
admin and granting permission there, then returning to the poweruser,
but they seem to be forgotten each time. Since both the email and
browser are in this list now, it is becomming very frustrating.
