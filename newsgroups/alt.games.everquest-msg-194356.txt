Never claimed it was a usefull charm. The OP said he wanted to find an easy
to obtain charm. Thats the easiest one Im aware of. As for a usefull charm.
For casters thats easy. Go get the one that drops off of the named on the
first boat in Dulak. Improves Int/Wis and I believe Mana based on how good
your specialized magic skills are.
