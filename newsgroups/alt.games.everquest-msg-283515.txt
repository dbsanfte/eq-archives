Using Focus, a pet will apparantly (according to the dev's) come with a 
set of summoned plate armor already on him.

I dug this chart out of a web posting:

Chest-17
Head-10
Legs-10
Hands-9
Arms-8
Feet-8
At least one wrist-7
Empty Waist Slot-0
Empty Face Slot-0
Empty Range Slot-0
Empty Neck Slot-0
Empty Back Slot-0
At least one empty finger slot-0
At least one empty ear slot-0
For a total of 69 AC (possibly 76 if he wears another bracer).

It seems based on some parsing that those "at least one" spots are in 
fact "just one" for some reason; apparantly putting two bracers on a pet 
didn't change its damage taken versus putting just one on.  That could 
be because the pet was low level, maybe at high levels they "dual weild" 
bracers while low levels ones don't.

But for the sake of argument, lets assume they don't.

Now, other tests indicate that a pet will only swap in a new item over 
an old one if its an "improvement" and the criteria for "improvement" 
for armor slots is "Best AC".

Summoning a full set of Callilev jewelry (and ignoring the stats that 
don't matter), we get

Earring: AC 7 HP 45
Neck: AC 9 HP 45
Bracer: AC 9 HP 45
Ring: AC 7 Str 10 HP 45
Shoulder: AC 10 HP 45
(other bracer that apparantly won't help)

The bracelet will replace the one thats already there, so you'll only 
see a 2 AC improvement.  On the other hand, its still 45 more HP.

Putting the jewelry on will net 42 AC and 225 HP

An alternative to the mantle for the shoulder would be elemental 
blanket, which is only AC 1, but +15 fire cold and magic resist, if 
you're having problems with your pet resisting casters.

Now the high levelweapons (66+ weapons are all the same stats, just 
different resist target), 160DD proc, +5 damage, and 75 hp, if you 
aren't high enough level though the proc won't go off and you might want 
to stick to the 61-65 summons, which only have 50 hp but still proc the 
same damage and have the same +damage bonus.

Two weapons (low level pets will only equip one) means 150hp, or 100 for 
the lower level version.  Under level 10, get the bigger one if you can, 
since neither will proc anyway, thats 75 hp, and that boost will mean a 
lot more to  your pet than it will to a high level one anyway.

Muzzle of Mardu goes on Face, no AC or HP but 11% item haste (which 
means stacks with cast haste)

Girdle of Magi'Kot has +15 to several key stats, Str, Dex, Sta, and AGI, 
and 500 hp.  Doesn't have to replace anything on waist, so it will work.

Elemental Defender is secondary slot or back slot, since we don't have 
anything in back this should work there; its AC 10, save versus cold 
magic and fire +5.  Make sure to equip it after giving the two weapons, 
though, as otherwise it will go in secondary slot, and then be discarded 
when the weapon comes in.

I can't think of anything useful for the ammo slot; I use Orb of 
Exploration in mine, which grants plainsight, but no AC.  I used to use 
Coldstone, and when I wore it I got the Ultravision from it, but not the 
5 AC bonus, so  apparantly AC doesn't work from there.

I can't think of anything for Range slot that has any positive effects, 
either, although I'm probably just overlooking something.  If there's 
something that has AC or anything, it should work from this slot, ammo 
is the only one that doesn't AFAIK

So, that comes to a total bonus of 10 more AC, 650 more HP, and 11% 
haste, along with some stat and resist bonuses.

Total improvement by going to all this trouble; 52 AC and 875 HP.  At 
low levels, certainly going to be noticable, at the high end of the 
game, not as much so, but still, thats likely worth the trouble if 
you're soloing... and maybe if your pet gets called on from time to time 
to "off tank".

On the other hand, the majority of the benefit comes from the belt, two 
weapons, and the mask; its a lot easier to just use those, and forgo the 
added niceties, particularly if you use some of the summoned jewelry 
yourself, its a pain to take it off and destroy it, then summon a fresh 
kit, hand to pet, destroy the remaining bracelet, summon again to equip 
yourself?
