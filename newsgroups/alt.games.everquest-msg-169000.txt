LOL. That's why I set it up to used E/D for forward/back and S/F for
left/right. Keeps your left hand in the same position for typing. =)
I hate it when games make me use WASD instead of letting you
re-map the keys. Thankfully most games allow for that now.

I never understood why the people that first set up movement
keys in games used WASD instead of ESDF. I think it may hark
all the way back to the apple when the move keys for 2 players were
set far apart since they both had to use the same keyboard.
