    I wish I could get on early - damned holiday season, too busy. We've
started in on the LDoN raids now. Started slow, the two Elemental ones that
we know of down so far. The other Quarm guild has spoilers for the Valdoon
event, so they kill that one and no others. We have spoilers available for
all the Time-level ones, but we want to learn as much as we can by trial and
error first. Soft players don't learn well when there are no spoilers! For
your reference: we kill Quarm in the place I mentioned we were trying at
first (it was one of three places we looked at, including your spot). We
don't use that spell you mentioned as being important. And our kills are the
definition of ugly - on the first one, at one point there were only 11
people in Time-B. FOR THE HIVE!

    James
