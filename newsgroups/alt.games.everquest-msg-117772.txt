Appearantly you should have spend more time learning to read:

Auction or Sale of Characters, Items and Coin

We have consistently advised all players -- through newsgroup postings 
and otherwise -- that selling items and/or coin is inappropriate 
gameplay. In addition to violating our agreement, selling or auctioning 
accounts, characters, items and/or coin violates our legal rights and 
may constitute misappropriation, interference with our contract with the 
users who quit in frustration, and tarnishes the goodwill in the 
EverQuest name.

The User Agreement and Software License, which you choose to 
affirmatively accept every time you reenter the game, prohibits the sale 
of accounts, characters, items and/or coin -- whether by auction (e.g. 
eBay) or otherwise. The User Agreement, in sections 1 and 7, prohibits 
the transfer of an EverQuest account and software, and in sections 6 and 
10 prohibits, among other things, gameplay which is inappropriate and 
actions which place an unreasonably large load on our infrastructure. 
Sections 7 and 8 of this Agreement provide that we own all property 
rights in the game, subject to your license to play the game.

To further emphasize these points, effective immediately, the following 
language shall be added to the end of section 9 of the User Agreement 
and as a section in the EverQuest rules of conduct:

"You may not sell or auction any EverQuest characters, items, coin or 
copyrighted material."

Just a question, what do you really do with EQ?
You dont have time to play, dont care about guilds, dont care about 
raids, why not just go play Minesweeper or something. You can even cheat 
there without anyone here flaming you.

Err, its not out terms, its Verants terms, which you agree on every time 
you enter the game. If you dont wanna follow them, go play Minesweeper.
