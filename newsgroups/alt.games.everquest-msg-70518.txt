Took my 34 druid to the moon with my 29 warrior friend, killed greens to me
in Marus Seru for 30 minutes, yelled at the warrior who said he was getting
"Mad Exp" because I was getting jack shit.  Went to Sanctus Seru, got the
warrior stuck in the shorty trap, then showed him it wasn't that much of a
trap.

Discovered most of the vendors in Sanctus Seru don't particularly care for
Wood Elf druids.  Went to Dawnshroud Mountains and had my first encounter
with the monster traps, discovered that mushrooms are insanely good exp at
around level 30-35, and hit like small children.

Found a Velium BD bracer on a vendor in Bazaar for 1564pp, bought it, and
foliage shield and Spirit of Eagle on a vendor in Fungus Grove for like 8pp
each.   Sold spells later for 1500, bracer for 2800.

Find out a guildie got a fungi, silver chitin hand wraps and a bunch of
other expensive stuff stolen by someone who wasn't supposed to have gotten
into the guild, loaned him 2k to buy another pair of hand wraps.

Logged off and finished putting my new computer together.

AMD Athlon XP 1500+
GA-7DX mobo
512 MB PC2100 DDRRAM
Voodoo 3 3000 (yes, I know its the bottleneck)
40GB 7200RPM  hard drive (WTF am I going to do with 40GB???)

Ok, so this is actually what I did Sunday, it's the last day I played EQ.

Then Monday, finished setting up new computer and discovered that my
framerate DOESN'T GO DOWN in Counter-Strike, I had over 100 FPS and it
stayed that way for a 2 hour session in which I owned people more than I
have in almost 18 months.  (when I first discovered EQ)

Not to mention, every other FPS game I installed gets freakin awesome
framerates  (Deus Ex, UT, Undying, Serious Sam 2 demo, Half-life and a dozen
mods)

hehe, OK, enough dick waving about my damn awesome new computer.  =P
