Does the LFG tag work that way?  One of the ways I figure out what
instance somebody is in while they are in a zone that has too long of a
name to tell on the map is with /who <name>.  Using that, unless they
are in the same instance as you, it will come back with the nobody
around here by that name error.  We also use to send people into other
instances of FG to see if anybody was LFG since we couldn't tell from
one instance.
