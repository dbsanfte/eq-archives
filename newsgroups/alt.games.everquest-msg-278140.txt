Yes. Immensely. I'd like them to do the bank the same way.

That's your perogative. Somebody probably still prefers the old 'hard 
coded 800x600 UI too. =)

You do realize that vendors sell more than just spells right? And for 
most of those things all you care about is that you've selected the 
right item, and have enough money.

And what about the 99% of items that aren't spells?

Actually eq only supports a few item windows, after you've got a few up 
the new one will replace an old one... so you don't have to keep closing 
them except when your done shopping.

But sure I agree I'd like there to be an option to make certain item 
windows autoclose.

Probably because you have looked at it from the very narrow perspective 
of someone who apparently only buys spells, and further who does so 
without foreknowledge of what it is he supposed to be buying.

If you already know what spells you need, the name & price are 
sufficient, the fact that you can now sort by name further speeds it up 
and allows you to shop at a glance instead of having to click on 80 
boxes to see whats for sale. (Or combine scrolling and the altkey, while 
dealing with popup names that are each offset from the next by an inch.)

It will also dramatically speed up purchasing various tradeskill items 
(spell research pages, runes, etc etc) which all have the same icon. 
(Particularly the ability to now sort them.)

The new way is much cleaner.

My *only* complaints so far is that it seems to lose your place in the 
scroll window when you buy something. I'd also like to see the lines 
numbered so i can see if the merchant is using all 80 slots. But those 
are pretty minor. Most merchants are never full, and most don't require 
me to scroll at all.
