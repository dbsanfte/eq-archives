  That's not for me to figure out.  I just know that as things are right
now, it takes too long for Verant CS to respond to customer concerns.  Too
many busy signals when calling a CS phone number that isn't even toll free,
a Tech Support chat room that isn't even open more than half the time, that
itself is often woefully understaffed, and servers that are staffed by
mostly unpaid volunteers who aren't able to resolve the most serious issues
a player will encounter.

  I'd like to see this change somehow... maybe they could invest the money
in better quality control and other preemptive measures if the increased
cost of subscription isn't enough to pay for the skilled techs or CS guys
that they need.  I've said before that I'd happily pay more for better CS,
though I'm not so hot on paying more for the SAME level of service.

  And that's just what I feel like I'm seeing here.  More of the same... the
only thing that's changing is the amount that a lot of people are paying to
Verant per month.  If the cost of adding these expansions is costing them so
much in server overhead and they aren't recouping the costs of developing
the expansions through retail sales, perhaps that's an indication that they
should slow down on adding content for now and focus on better management
and improving what they already have in place.  They seem to be committed to
doing the exact opposite.

  That's all I'm saying.  I'd rather not see more content for now, I think
we have plenty... I want to see fixed bugs and better CS.  I know a lot of
people see things similarly.  And I know there's a lot of people who are
always hungry for new content and new things to do, and who are either happy
or tolerant of Verant CS and the other issues I'm bothered with.  I guess
there's more people who don't want what I want, or at least that's Verant's
perception.
