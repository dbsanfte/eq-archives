to quote:

"Man, you need to read the patch notes more. They did away with
that bonus like... 8 patches ago (or more)"

You should go back and read what you wrote - you wouldn't contradict
yourself while you thrash.

I notice that all you needed was to have your hand held to find
it.  Now, how about the numbers?

Oh, when you do try to prove that you kill fast enough solo at 58 to
overcome the advantages of the full group bonus and high con bonus,
you should know that I was wrong.

Yep, I said it, we didn't kill 33 an hour in BoT.  We killed 42.

From the moment he says "assist me on" at 08:25:11 to the 
42nd "You gain party experience!!" message at 09:25:13 was 1 hour
and 2 seconds.  This was in no way an elite group - it consisted
of Warrior (65, 70ish AA, 7920 HP group buffed), BL (65, 40ish AA),
Mage (65, 61 AA), Wizard (65, 40 or 50 AA - he replaced his 65,
200 aa ranger with her), Cleric (65, 200 aa) and Druid (65 and dinged
210 in the hour).

So, now to beat it your 58 needs to kill no less than 70 level 43
mobs per hour.

Rereading some of that log made me want to resubscribe.

Just in case you don't believe me :
