My wife used to be an avid Star Wars: Galaxies player and she says
it's the same thing there: entire planets are "ghost towns".  She
loved the game when it was a sort of sandbox where you could pretty
much play as you wanted to. A while back SoE revamped SW:G to try to
make it more like WoW, and that pretty much put the nail in the
coffin.  

It's really too bad, because instead of trying to make SW:G a WoW
clone SoE should have touted the differences and attracted the players
who weren't in to a WoW-style MMO.
