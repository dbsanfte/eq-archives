I suggest saving all the Honeycombs you get.  Get some bags or boxes and put
them in the bank.  Enchanters need them for the Stein of Mogguk quest, and I
pay a plat each for them if I can't find them on vendors.  I hate chasing
down Bixies.  I know about the spawn point by the tower in the wall, but I
never get any combs from them.  The Deputies with their aggro range the size
of West Karana doesn't help, either.

Oddly enough, I found a Honey Jum on the the gal that gives you the Honey
Jum when you give her the 3 honeycombs and 30gp.  I thought it was no-drop.
Assuming it is no-drop, how did she get one?  My only theory is that someone
turned in the combs and cash for the Jum, and then did it again ( it's
lore ), and since it couldn't give the player the Jum, the halfling gal kept
it.  It's a long shot, though.

Any ideas on how she got one?  It's probably pretty obvious, and I'm missing
it.
