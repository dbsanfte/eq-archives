There's 5 flavors of XP:

Consumer (this is the direct Win9X upgrade).
Professional (Win2K pro upgrade).
Server (Win2K server upgrade).
Advanced Server (Win2K advanced server upgrade).
.NET Server (brand spanking new).

That's not even including the IA64 version (64-bit version of XP
running on Intel Itanium systems)....would be funny to have a
"Consumer" version of that one.

Home systems doesn't need Active Directory domain support.
Workstations (which generally are installed in corporate networks)
do...I admit I have a AD set up at home for my LAN, but I tend to
consider my setup somewhat unusual.

It is.
It became viable the moment multimedia hardware vendors started
writing drivers for it.
