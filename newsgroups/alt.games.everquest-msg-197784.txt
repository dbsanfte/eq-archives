I love LoY for xp'ing.  I took my mage from 55 to 58 there and 2 AA's.
Torgiran mines are incredible as well as Dulak.  Gunthak is pretty good for
a little lower level range.  Dulak almost always has all of the ships camped
on my server.  Torgiran is however as slow as you say, there never seems to
be anybody in my way.  I've never been to Hate's Fury and haven't really
done any xp'ing in Nadox although I hear it's good there too.
