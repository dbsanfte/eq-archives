I was actually wondering about this myself.  I thought that after it was
applied in the Warrens and Stonebrunt, part of it was that quest items
aren't affected by TLC (like the heritic heads).  I recently made a monk on
FV (Kaeltos Jr.) who's now level 6.  He's done his first, and abou to start
on his second, headband quest.

Almost all of the things for his newbie armor in Qeynos is on vendors
(except for woven spider silk, which I have yet to find in that area) so I'm
not really worried about that.  What I am worried about, is the fact that
monks have quests all over Norrath that may be in trouble if quest items are
part of TLC.

After reading your post, I'm having horrible visions about trying to find
the cash to port back and forth from Qeynos to Freeport doing quests at
their appropriate level for my epic (which starts at level one for us monks)
while killing enough skellies to get my faction up in Cabillis without going
over the XP giving TLC level so I can start my shackle quests in case I
actually want to try for my whistling fists one day...

Whew..  That hurt my head..
