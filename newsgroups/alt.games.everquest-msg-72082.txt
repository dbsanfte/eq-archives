The other day, in Velks, a 56 monk got killed. 90% rez was available,
but he _needed_ the 96% rez because he'd lose so much exp otherwise.
He tries to find a cleric, spends forever getting ported back when he
can't find one, loots his gear - AND everything else. And had closed
the empty corpse, so it was too late to tell him to /q out.

As nasty as that was, I couldn't help but reflect on the irony of the
thing. (Especially since I believe he could have made up the 6%
difference during the hunting time we lost while he was looking for
the precious 56 cleric and then a port from the moon.)
