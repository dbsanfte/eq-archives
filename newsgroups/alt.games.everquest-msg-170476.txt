It's been steadily driving me mad today.  I know the test server is
intended for testing stuff (duh!), but I think it's reasonable to
expect that stuff at least gets to a candidate release stage before
they open it up to the public.  

So far, my experience with it (on an XP system) has been very poor.
Alt-Enter gets me back to the desktop, but I have to bugger about
trying various other keyboard combinations to get EQ to release the
mouse.  If at any time I accidentally hit the Windows key, it's game
over (and that's with application compatibility for EQ enabled).
Chances are that alt-tab will also kill it, particularly if I have EQ
in full screen at the time.  As someone whose dog occasionally likes
to use 2 accounts with EQW, that's a tough habit to get out of (as is
using the Windows key to get back to the desktop).

But even more annoying than the constant risk of EQ imploding is the
way it's screwed up the graphics.  I use a KVM switch with two other
PCs, and frequently switch between them.  I run all three machines at
1600 x 1200 @ 85Hz, so that the screen settings are constant and I'm
not constantly having to mess around with the monitor's distortion
settings.  All of a sudden, the PC running EQ looks like an egg timer
but claims to be running 1600 x 1200 @ 85Hz, which should be okay.
Infuriating!  They should have just endorsed EQW.

Also today there's something very strange going on with STR - mine has
been up and down like a yoyo for no apparent reason, behaviour
confirmed by other a.g.e. testes.

Still, you play on test, you're asking for trouble I suppose.
