> What a dumbass reply.

well you get what you deserve. He doesnt mention where he is, eg, wether he
is US, Europe or elsewhere, and, geee, lets add one and one together: he
wants a game that is played on the computer or commonly called a (Dr Evil
style) "computer game", oh shock horror!! and that you might be able to get
it from a place that (wait for it) .... sells computer games .... Or do you
think that someone who knows how to use and configure a newsreader of some
type does not know this already?? Anyway I am guessing he is not after a
reference such as http://www.ebworld.com/ but more like www.waresrus.com .
