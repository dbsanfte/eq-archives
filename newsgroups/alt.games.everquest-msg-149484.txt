This works great if cleric is on root "mez" duty, as
it pulls all the adds onto him, so he can run them
to one side, root them, and then run back to the
fight.

Stop wasting your mend.  6 minutes till you get it again, and any time
during that 6 minutes you might be FD barely alive and out of heal
range!  Mend every time it comes up is for low level monks, who
need to do this in order to get the skill up.  When it becomes useful,
you save it.  Whats 25% of a monks HP every 6 minutes, in terms
of mana cost to a cleric or other healer?  Chump Change, thats what.

Make that "poor aggro management..." if there's a class in the
game that has to worry more about this issue I can't think
what it is.

This goes for everyone.  Melee shouldn't be hitting mobs until the
MA says to do so.  One of my favorite memories of this was with
an MA friend who sent me a tell asking me to be ready to use all
my mana healing him next fight.  He tagged a mob off the puller,
it came in, and he started tanking it.  Melee peeled off to rush in
and help... and backed off one after another.  Apparantly all
the guild officers were in on the plan, and were screaming in
tells at anyone that moved... he never called for assist, tanked the
mob to death solo (blowing out all my mana as he predicted), and
then explained once again that THAT is how this is supposed to
work, noone goes in till assist is called.  Whole guild improved
massively after that, and its a lesson I've never forgotten, even
though I'm on a different server, different character, and have
gone thru about five guilds since.

And think about that plan REAL carefully.  AE line is very powerful
for soloing, or for certain group encounters, but 19 times out of 20
its useless in a group or raid...worse than useless, invitation to wipe.

Root the mob and move back.  Kite the mob in circles around the
group.  Neither of these are "like a chicken with its head cut off",
though, they are deliberate tactical plans that require at least a bit
of preparation and skill to use.  Running randomly screaming "get
it off me" is not the same thing.

Oh, and Necros also get Mez line, and quite a few classes can root
things off you, so don't just stick to chanter/bard mez.  If its
root "mez," moving isn't not just not a bad idea, its critical.

This one is soooo hard for some people to figure out.  I love doing this,
do it sometimes even when something IS working.  Maybe doing it
this other way will work even better!

Non Damage roots are great.  Damage roots are less so, resisted more,
break mez, more aggro... but any root is better than "dead if the
chanter dies," so keep one memmed.
