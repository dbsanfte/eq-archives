Shortly after they added Paineel I submitted that bug. They said it wasn't a
bug, but working as intended. I don't know the reason behind it, but it has
been going on for a very long time. The guy outside the bank was added to
sell that stupid newspaper that I don't think anyone reads. He was added
around the time Stonebrunt opened. So in actuality, according to the devs
that made the zone, he is the one that is bugged.
