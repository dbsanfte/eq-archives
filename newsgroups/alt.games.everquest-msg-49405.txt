Yeah. Let me break it down for you.

You, as a quad-kiting wizard, couldn't care less about the casting
time. You don't frequently get dispelled and then have a need to
instantly recast. However, that's exactly what an uber guild needs -
instant casting time. But it's MUCH more efficient to pay 10k for
Jboots than spend 24 hours camping them, for this guild at least.

Not to mention that (for me, anyway) the 1.5 seconds is a big PITA and
I'd probably pay 5k more for instant if that was the only way.
