No, this one is on the first floor.  It is before the back entrance to
the dog area.  The room I am thinking of is a round room, lined with
golems on the outside.  It is the same as the statue room, except on
the other side (turn right instead of left), and has golems instead of
statues.

That is how we beat him down also.  That portal is the second best
thing ever, right behind the working map in LS :P  There really isn't a
need for a full two groups on him except to get as many people through
that step as possible and to beat the 15 minute timer.

I really like the Bastion.  That was really fun :)  It helps if you
have somebody with you who has done it to explain it, otherwise you get
a lot of deaths.

I have run about eight groups through SBD.  It takes me between an hour
and a half and two hours now.  The fact that it works every time (well,
for me - I know one guildie who had problems with the CoB part twice)
makes me enjoy running people through it.
