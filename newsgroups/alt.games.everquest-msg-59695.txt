It's also frowned upon by the user agreement......

....And it's also frowned upon by fellow players who potentially have to
deal with a "Baby Huey" ...a high level character being played by a newbie
who doesn't know which way is up for his class and level.  [Baby Huey was a
cartoon character gigantic baby who did not understand his own strengths and
powers, and often caused massive disasters as he innocently waddled through
life.].

That could get parties in serious danger fast.  The problems are multiplied
when it's done on a PvP server.
