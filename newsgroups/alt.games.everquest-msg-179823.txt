Last night my guild went to Umbral Plains and took down Doomshade.  We
killed many many Dark Assassins then decided that since we had been there a
while we might as well kill the Dark Masters.  After about 45 minutes or so
(wasn't watching the clock) the DM's were back up and we heard the chanting.
We immediately pulled them and killed them again and got the shout about the
darkness coming, etc. etc.  Doomshade spawned and we took him down, although
it was a close call, we had 30 people there in the raid average level was
60.  My question is:  does killing the Dark Masters cause them to respawn
and chant right away?  If so that would seem like the fastest way to get
things going.  Supposedly they chant every 3 hours, I'm just trying to get a
clearer picture, rather then "we did it this way so that must be it" line of
reasoning.

Thanks,
