Ah, and one of the unexpected shortcomings of the leezards comes to
light.
*sigh*
Having gotten my Iksar warrior in full banded fairly cheaply, I've still
been saving money at a nice pace. (The bone chip market near Cabilis is
outstanding, with several regular softskin visitors paying excellent
plat for stacks of chips to do the Trooper Modo quest for faction.) 
This has caused me to begin turning my attention to my sad state of
weaponry. I know that, particularly with post Luclin mudflation, some
very nice "newbie weapons" can be had cheaply on my old play server, and
I'm assuming the same holds true for Innoruuk. 

Within another level or two I anticipate having a good couple hundred
plat in the bank. If I could only make it to GFey to spend a few hours
watching the auctions carefully, I could probably get some decent
weapons. (At least FAR superior to the tarnished skellie drops and one
player crafted 1HS things I'm swinging now.)

Assuming that GFey is the home of all /auction spam on this server, the
trip there is a bit daunting. Trying to go the LoIO to FM to DL route is
obviously the shortest, and the FM leg of it isn't bad if you can avoid
the odd giant on the zone wall. But the LoIO jog and particularly that
HUGE run through DL looks pretty bad for a lvl 12/13 Iksar baby.

I know, I could strip him naked but for a couple throwaway tarnished
blades, stuff everything in the bank, and just go for it. One death of a
naked lost corpse wouldn't shatter my little world at these levels. But
should I even bother? Kunark is a different trip than running naked
level ones around Antonica from what I've seen.

The benefits are great if I manage it. I can port up to Luclin, fill up
my bank with ten slot trader's satchels while I'm there, port down to
GFey to buy my weapons, port back up to bank them, then suicide on a
bazaar warder for the "poor man's teleport" back to FoB.

I'm just rambling now. So many choices. 
*sigh*
