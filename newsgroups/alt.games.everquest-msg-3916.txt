If you can, just save you're whole Everquest directory, it will save you
patch time when you're coming back up.. I have my drive partitioned in to a
C:\ drive, Games drive, Utility drive and Data drive/ When I reformat C, all
my game info is left alone. If you can't save the whole Everquest directory,
your settings are in the files with the extension .opt. Just save all of
those, and the .ini files, copy them back into the main Everquest directory
after you reinstall, and your buttons and interface settings will be saved.

Life is complex, meaning some of it is real, and some of it is imaginary.
