That's the thing about a monopoly; eventually people forget alternatives
existed. A lot of managers genuinely have no idea that there are other
browsers, and when I point out that a web site like www.bigpond.com (for
example) is only really accessible to people using windows, despite the fact
that it's the ISP's home page and should be available to everyone, I'm met
with indifference at best.

I've dealt with quite a few companies that demand you use internet explorer
to be able to update it's products. This is just insane. At least everquest
has refrained from that thus far.
