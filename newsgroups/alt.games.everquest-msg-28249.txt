 A Monk wearing a shield isn't a good thing. You don't get bash so the
only real advantage is more AC while adding the big disadvantage of less
damage output, allowing the critter to live longer thus negating the
additional AC of the shield in the first place. I'm not even sure there
are any shields that are monk equippable but I suppose there could be. I
never really looked.
