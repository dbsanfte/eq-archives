I've done some research and I think the GeForce Pro's and Ti's are a better
value then the 400MX. The 400 can't handle DDR memory properly so you're
getting a RAM bottleneck.  With the PRO and Ti, you can really use DDR
memory which gives you much more speed since you can move data faster.
Otherwise at some point the faster graphics engine could become starved for
data.
