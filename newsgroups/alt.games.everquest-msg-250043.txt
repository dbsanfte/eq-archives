I 'get' rpgs just fine... but the fact I have 5 dollars in my pocket
rather than 10 and a friend hands me 1000 pesos that I switch into
dollars doesn't exactly bring god into the equation. Now.. if 1000
pesos appeared out of nowhere with the note 'use them well - GOD',
then you might have a point. But nobody is automagically inventing
money that does not allready exist and has been worked for.

Assuming the pp truly appeared out of nowhere... that would be the
case. But assuming he paid $200 to purchase 200 credits with which he
traded for 200kpp from another person in that world, it is not. All
items in that chain were worked for and a deal was struck.

Can we just agree that we think differently when it comes to these
things? :>.

Every item in the game uses a method of payment that the *character*
has no conceivable access to. That being the money you paid to
subscribe. No money = no items. For $12.99/month along with
$30/expansion(assuming it just came out) you get access to all the
zones you have registered for and get for your character all the drops
you can accumulate. What is simply being suggested here is for $1 per
currency i'll call Dollarium.. a mystical stone mined by the Wayfarers
on a lost part of Taelosia called Bankia can be yours. Furthermore, if
you turn that currency back in.. you will receive $1 for it minus a
transfer charge. :>. Granted.. i'm no writer of lore but i'm sure
something can be made to introduce a currency that just so happens to
track with money.

That just takes a writer to gloss over with lore. Hell.. the rest of
the game lore makes about as much sense most of the time :>.
