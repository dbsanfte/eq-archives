ADH = alt.dss.hack


There are many people that used to be in this group who enjoyed
attacking my family and my children.

They also would attack ANYONE who would, even remotely, speak out
against their tactics, in an effort to change the thinking of this
group.

That is the text book definition of terrorism modified for USENET...

The GOOD news is I, along with a few others in this group were pretty
successful in chasing them away..
