I'll hop in too :)

Ive never had people round me use lizard and reptile interchangably...so
I really think its a local thing.  Certainly in the UK its drummed into us
(or was) at school that turtles/tortoises had shells, snakes had no legs
except for the slow-worm which was a lizard with no legs, and then crocs
had sideways legs..anything else was a lizard...so the distinction was
made for us...

On the issue of what the heck is a Iksar, I'd lean towards 
saurials...advanced lizardy types probably advanced dinosaurs by an
alternate evolutionary route from them dinos  rather than as a development
of 'modern' lizards. That gives the bipedal nature quite nicely, gives you
a place to put dragons too :) ie no real counterpart in real life other
than an evolutionary  potential cut off in its prime by a sodding great
chunk of rock (allegedly)
