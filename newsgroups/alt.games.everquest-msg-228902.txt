My pet peeve - all the current whining on the various boards!

Monks think they suck.
Warriors think they suck
Mages think they suck
Bards think they suck
.....

I can't find a SINGLE class board that's not full of bitching and moaning
about how everyone else is better off than they are.  If you took the boards
as gospel, you'd think the game is unplayable from level 1 - every single
class is broken beyond repair, useless in groups and raids, etc.  Absor's
right, the classes are pretty much balanced - they're all a waste of time.
Good heavens, how does a level 65 in full elemental sneak out of town past
Orc 1 without being killed by the pawns????

It's a game, people, and it's not perfect.  Nobody's class is as good as
they want it to be, everyone wants improvements.  Get OVER it!!!  Don't
threaten to leave, just DO IT if you're that unhappy!!!
