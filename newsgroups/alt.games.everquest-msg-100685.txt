Hmmm. Using that figure and my  estimate of 3270 hours played in the
last three years, let's see how that stacks up to some of my other
liesure-time activities:

Opera: US$23.33/hr
Movies: US$6.33/hr
Video Rental: US$2.67/hr
Cable TV: US$0.76/hr
Paperback Novel: US$0.46/hr
EverQuest: US$0.15/hr

So, that *whopping* 30% increase brings EverQuest all the way up to
US$0.18/hr[1], still well below every liesure time activity *except*
poker, which is net positive, but has a huge standard deviation.

Luclin made me realize my machine was no longer as state-of-the-art as
I'd been thinking of it as. Of course, if it hadn't something else
would. It's an inevitable part of the upgrade cycle.

If I'd worked all the time I played EverQuest, I'd be up about
US$196,200. I'm sure it would pay for a lovely casket once I worked
myself to death.

[1] Based on the fact that software has cost me US$160.00 or so of the
initial figure of US$485.04.
