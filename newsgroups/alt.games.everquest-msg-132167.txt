That interface, btw, is going into effect later this month.  Taken from 
castersrealm.com:

SCHEDULED PATCH JULY 24

This from the scheduled downtime page: 
On Wednesday, July 24th, at 3AM PDT, (10AM GMT), all EverQuest servers 
will be brought down for a scheduled patch. The estimated downtime is 5 
hours.
- The EverQuest Operations Team 

We asked Alan VanCouvering if this patch would put the new User 
Interface and the Bazaar on the Live Servers. Here was the response: 
Yes - As a part of the rollout for the new interface, Beta Two of the 
new UI and the Bazaar will begin on the Live servers as of the next 
patch.
It's had an excellent few weeks overall on the Test Server and we'll be 
running it on the Live servers in an optional mode until we're satisfied 
with it. We'll give details about how to turn these options on in the 
patch message. 

- Alan 

Should be a great day for EQ'ers if all goes smoothly!
