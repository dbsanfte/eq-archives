Best class to play for those with poor computers and/or connections:

Cleric

Who gets to stare at a wall 98% of the time?  A cleric.  Who gets invited
into groups in spite of being laggy?  A cleric.  Who will the group wait on
and help get places the most?  A cleric.  Who can turn off *all* spam (when
they don't have serverfilter botched up)?  A cleric.

Your friend has a screw loose.

You absolutely want to avoid: Enchanter, bard, monk, magician, necro

You probably want to avoid: Ranger, shaman, solo-wizard, solo-druid

Magician and necro might be a bit easier to deal with in laggy conditions
with the recent pet changes.  At least when you lag your pet won't go out
and bring the whole dungeon back to try and chase away your lag anymore.

Warrior, paladin, SK are all decent choices for slower
connections/computers.
