You don't get any bonus to success for reaching the trivial point on an 
item.  The higher your skill level vs the trivial level of an item, the 
more likely you are to succeed in making the item.  There used to be a 
cap of a 95% success rate on any item, even if you were 200 points over 
the trivial level.  They have changed that part so that massively trivial 
items have a much lower fail rate.

People have made serious amounts of plat from doing tradeskills, even 
with making items with a 50% success rate.

I am a tradeskiller, and, I still make a reasonable profit at it.  
Nothing huge, but for a few minutes a day of work, I bring in a few k 
plat every week from my bazaar mule who I leave up when I am not playing.
