His point is that prior to getting EQ and at least AM2 you'd be doing more
damage with your melee weapons than your bow. Even with the best bows in the
game your damage won't even be close without those two AA skills under your
belt. After 55 you can get some decent damage when Trueshot is available but
other than that melee is the way to go.
As a younger ranger you'll want to keep your archery up for when it becomes
a viable form of combat but beyond that if your bowing when your party is
engaging a mob then your really screwing them over. And if you've decided to
roleplay a stupid character expect others to roleplay that they don't want
you in their groups.

My advice for keeping your archery up is to bow kite from time to time for
skill ups. Personally from about 40th onward I really liked Tarbul
Earthstrider in EK he regens at an incredible rate and he's red up into your
60s so it won't take long to max your archery each level using him for a
target. Don't expect to kill him he regens faster then you can damage him,
But snare will land so you can just kind of lead him about and he can't kill
you either. Be considerate and don't drag him over others and root park his
ass back on the mountain before you bolt out of the zone when you've maxed
your skills.
Other than that use your bow to pull. use it to pull. and ... use it to
pull.

On the original posters question. I don't suggest soloing at all. You'll get
enough of that when your not grouped. However there isn't anything else a
ranger finds more anoying than a piss poor ranger at the upper levels
messing with our rep.
We've had a problem with our reputation since Kurnak and panic animal hasn't
done a damn thing to help it.
You end up with a bunch of rangers with no concept of agro control, and who
isn't familiar with the capabilities of other classes.
This isn't to say not to solo, Just that one should spend plenty of time in
groups.
