Hello

I have seen a lot of your Guildys around and am really struck by the guild
name (reminds me of Pratchett). Does you have a guild website so I can see
what you're all about, membership policies etc. Never grouped with anyone
from your guild but I saw your post in the Runnyeye thread and thought I'd
quickly ask here.

TIA
