Been saying it for well over 5 years:  "If you don't want to get hit by a 
train, don't sit on the tracks!"

Zone in while invisible.  If that's not possible (you can't self-cast and 
can't afford potions) then go in at full health and be prepared to zone 
back.  For god's sakes don't go afk while zoning in.

Don't choose a camp near the zone line.

You're smart enough to figure out there's lots of trains...let's hope you're 
smart enough to adapt.  Unannounced trains are a part of EQ.  Whining about 
them - while perhaps fun - does no one any good.
