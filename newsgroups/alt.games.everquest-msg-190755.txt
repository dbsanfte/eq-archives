Why will I not name the guild? Well, as I've stated several times in this
thread I *know* that the guild name was chosen specifically because it wasn'
t able to be /who alled. They obviously have their reasons for wanting this
kind of anonymity, so I see no reason why I should name them.

My question was regarding finding a guild ID reference, as I'm just curious
to see whether I could in fact /who all them via this means.

Stevie.
