DPB and DPS are the same thing.  If the mob lasts 100 seconds, and you 
do 10 DPS then you do 10x100 or 1000DPB.

Not true.  Take into account that a Paladin has LOH and he'll outlast a 
warrior every single time in a single fight.  Take into account that a 
Paladin stuns the mob and so lowers the mob's DPS and a Paladin will 
take less damage during a fight than a warrior from that point alone 
(assuming the mob can be stunned).

Who cares, you're not soloing.

I have experience.  I'm telling you that in a 6 person group in most 
conditions a Paladin is far better overall than a Warrior.  The minor 
difference between Paladin and Warrior DPS, AC, HP and Skills is nothing 
over the course of a few fights.

When you get into the high 50's, and AA's come to play, then warriors 
become better at soaking up damage, and so your healer has less to do, 
but it doesn't make the warrior put out any more dps, not does it mean 
they'd be a better choice than a paladin.

I've tanked in groups and I've played high-dps classes in a groups, 
Paladin's are generally more useful.

And that's from someone who loves his Dwarven Warrior and first ever 
serious EQ character, and still plays him.
