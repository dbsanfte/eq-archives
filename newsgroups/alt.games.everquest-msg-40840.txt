When I sense impending failure of a website I use, but which has pretty
static content (I use allakhazam for prices mostly), I fire up my copy of
JOC webspider and download the page and burn it to CD.  I have several
saved, including eqdiva, allakhazam, eqatlas, and eq.castersrealm (not that
these are closing down, just that they have good info that I don't want to
have to get on the web to look up)
