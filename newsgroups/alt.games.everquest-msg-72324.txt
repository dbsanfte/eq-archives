Hello Folks,

I have what might be a really stupid question about the EQ inventory 
screen ....

I am running the Ruins of Kunark. When I am playing, I use the "big" 
screen view with the transparent windows. When I go into my inventory, 
my screen swicthes modes and I am put in the "default" screen view, 
then, when I am done, my screen switches back to the transparent view. I 
noticed that a friend of mine was able to open his inventory on the 
transparent screen as opposed to the "default", low resolution view 
where everything looks like stone. I was wondering if anyone knows how 
to make this modification, he claims that he doesn't know how he did 
that. 

I hope I explained this correctly, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Lazarus
