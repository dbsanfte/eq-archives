Ooh, are you talking about the /mcicontrol command? That works to play mp3s,
but it doesnt use your default mp3 player. I'm not sure what it uses... But
I use Winamp all the time, and when the /mcicontrol thing first went in I
tried it out, and it skipped horribly. If only there was some way to control
Winamp while within EQ...

If you're not talking about the /mcicontrol thing (not sure what you mean by
"those directx commands") then I'm no help. :)
