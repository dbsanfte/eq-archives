Why the bork isn't there a "Medium" LDoN setting?

"Normal" is now so stupidly easy for my regular group that I have
*Deliberately* pull hideous trains every so often to keep people *AWAKE*...
and yet "Hard" is so ludicrously hard we haven't even attempted one with our
regular group - only when we get an extra healer and our guild's top
chanter. (in which case we can reliably win but usually have a death or
two).

Somewhere in between would be nice! You could give it the same loot as
normal - sucky, but who cares we're getting points, say 75 of them per
adventure, and give mobs some more HP and have them hit for 700's.

Is there a single reason why this shouldn't be done?

Is there any reason it would be too hard for sony to pull off? I mean what
would have to change?

a) some interface stuff
b) a new points scale on a third category of adventure
c) put up some mob levels on said category

OR if we can't have a "medium", how about upping the points on those kinds
of adventures nobody ever does anymore? I don't know about the rest of yas,
but we tend to not bother with anything bar collect these days, because we
can finish them in 20-40 minutes, and the next-briefest averages twice that.
ouch.

Regards,
James
