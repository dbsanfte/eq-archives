I know, Time Warner (the shit hole I'm at) used to own/run them.

I just don't understand why people expect us to be all scared and fold
to them when they're going to run to a dish.  Instead, they expect us
to give them free service (so either way we don't make money) or send
someone out NOW to make them happy.  AFAIK, a truck trip cost
something like $75, and that doesn't count if you have to call an on
call tech who gets overtime now...

So GO to dish, you twit!  You'll be back.
