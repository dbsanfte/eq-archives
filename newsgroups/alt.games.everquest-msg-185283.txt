On a not-really-related topic our raids now tend to have HoV MGB'ed
then all those that want Blessing and Kazad instead frantically
clicking it off before those are MGB'ed a few minutes later.

Hand of Virtue

Increase Total Hit Points by 1405
Increase Armor Class (AC) by 72

Blessing + Kazad`s Mark

Increase Armor Class (AC) by 33
Increase Total Hit Points by 618 
Increase Total Hit Points by 910
Regeneration for 8000 Mana in 1000 ticks

You could even (Clerics willing, heh) add Ward of Gallantry (+54 AC)
to that and come out ahead on all counts except buff slots.
Disclaimer: I've never seen it cast or asked for so don't even know
if it stacks properly with the two above even though it should.
