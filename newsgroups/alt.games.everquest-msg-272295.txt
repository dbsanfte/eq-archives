Here's a (relatively) quick way to make some cash.

You know all those book quests (in the mage tower in SQ, not sure in 
Freeport) . . . after you complete the quest, which is usually a 10 step 
process of killing stuff that you are probably hunting anyway, you can sell 
the completed book back to a vendor for a really nice price.  I just 
finished 'The Three Keys Part 1" and sold the book back for 1.5G (that's G 
for gold!).  I also finished the two Miner's Guides and sold them for about 
60s each.

Unless you want to keep the book to put on you bookshelf (which no one will 
see and/or care about) sell 'em back!
