Fine, I don't agree with your opinions, can you please stop posting them?  I
think it reflects poorly on the other people in this NG and I don't want to
be associated with it, I know that I can "just not read it", but I think I
have a right to see about getting a satisfactory resolution before I go that
road.

then anyone else can do it to you.  Where does it end?
