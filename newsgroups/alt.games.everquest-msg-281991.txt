Not sure what you mean by 'both'.  My links were both to the same location,
which is a free, Sony-run, trial version of EQ1.

The other link, which I snipped, is a link to a fan-run, unofficial,
quasi-legal 'version' of EQ1 which requires the use of the official client,
but doesn't use any official servers.

The above links demonstrate the exact game you would get if you buy the
boxed set of EQ1 and connect to Sony's servers.  It's free to download the
client, and free to play, but you're limited to level 10.

It should give you a good overview of EQ1, the interface, game-play, and if
it's packed, it might be an indication that lots of people are showing
interest.

EQ1 is a mature game, many of the players have been playing a long time,
but it is by no means dead, and there are new players still starting out.
However, newer games such as EQ2 and World of Warcraft are likely to have a
larger number of new players.

EQ1 and EQ2 are not comparable, they are based on the same mythology, but
they are different games.  Yes, they're both MMORPG's, but they were
designed by different people with different goals, and the gameplay
experience is totally different.

Only you can decide which you want to play - I recommend trying the free
EQ1 trial, and checking out Sony's EQ2 site and seeing if they offer
something similar there.  I also recommend seeing if Blizzard offer a free
trial for World of Warcraft, and indeed if any other MMORPG's are doing
similar.

They are all so varied in terms of gameplay, that different games suit
different people.
