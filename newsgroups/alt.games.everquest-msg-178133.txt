Goin' Through The Motions
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

( - E. Bloom - I. Hunter - )

Too wild to care, you got that animal stare
You got stay anywhere in your eyes
And you're leading me on, but you can be anyone
'Cause I know you'll be gone 'fore I rise

And we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Going through the motions

Staying with you gave us something to do
I almost thought it was true for a while
'Cause there's love in you lies, you senility skies
You couldn't tell right from wrong if you tried

And we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Going through the motions

To thee I dedicate this photograph
I'll even sign it "love to you" again
And when it's faded and forgotten in some book
You'll sometimes look, you'll sometimes look, you'll sometimes look

It's a game, it's a game, no let's call it a shame
'Cause there's no one to blame just to pay
You were a friend for a day, so don't cry if I say
That you got what you want, it's OK

And we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Going through the motions

Yeah, yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Yeah, we're going through the motions
Going through the motions
