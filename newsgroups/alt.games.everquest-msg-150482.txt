From prior experience, *everybody* gets any "new engine" because it's just
too hard for them to support the old one anymore.  That's why windows 95 is
no longer supported, even if all you have is the original game.

The big feature is the ability to port around from city to city with ease. 
No idea on the details, but it sounds like a handy enough feature for most
anybody to want it.
