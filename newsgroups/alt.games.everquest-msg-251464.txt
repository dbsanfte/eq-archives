Update - I got in touch with EQ Tech Support and they had me email some
files from my eq folder so they could check them out.  It seems the only
zone I can't go into is Butcherblock - I tried going in through GFay and by
using the Kaladim stone in POK - I get stuck each time.  No problems with
other zones........weird.

Windows mode is still making my screen go black though.
