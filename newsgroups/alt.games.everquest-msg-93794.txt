Hehe, we were farming all 4 houses when we thought we needed 3rd earring
(and hence 4 of those damn reports) for the Seru key. Grand total of ONE
report in over 100 hours combined farming. A chance /say while waiting
around chatting about it, triggered a nearby NPC to 'join in' the
conversation, and now we know we don't need the reports for a key, heh.

Yttrium we know about, as well as blood, but we don't actually have the
full recipes. Care to share? ):oP

Gonna be a while before Seru anyway, since we have switched focus to Emp
Ssra. Gotta love farming key components for a large guild /sigh
