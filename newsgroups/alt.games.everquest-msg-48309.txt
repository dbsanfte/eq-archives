at times, but the time spent alone wandering in the foggy trees in a
zone with a population of one beats even that pretty BP the cleric
picked up on the last such camp.  Sure it isn't something shiny to show
off or sell  for stacks of coins, but its the part of the game that
keeps it from being merely a strategy game like chess <eg>.
