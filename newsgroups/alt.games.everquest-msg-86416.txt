I have a 12th rogue. I get dual wield at 13. I have been alternating
between
a coldain velium rapier and a tombcarver. Right now my str is 90, dex
133 and piercing is 60 and 1hs is only 21. I have a wakasashi of
frozen skies in my pack waiting for dual weild so i can use it
effectivly. My question is do i have to put it in my primary hand to
get the skill increases? Also, do weapons in off hand proc as much?
Since tombcarver is 17 delay ive been using it mostly because those
extra attacks seem to more than make up for the few procs that the
velium weapon does. But when i hit 20 and the waka starts procing
should i make it my main? I know i should keep a piercing as main if i
wanna use poison but those procs are free. Any advice on what to
expect as a rogue would be greatly appreciated....hopefully from
higher level rogues whove been there and done that but also from other
classes who work with rogues a lot. For example, as a warrior its hard
to keep aggro when one of those lil shredding machines goes to work on
the posterior of the mob im fighting. And the cleric seems to be
casting a lot of heals on the Rogue from mob aggro. Yes, i have taunt
maxed and im using a procing SSOY in one hand and a wakasashi of
frozen skies in other hand but still have a tough time keeping up with
a rogue when it comes to a mobs sheer pissedoffedness. To me the
simple solution would be for the rogue to just stop attacking until
the MA retrieves the aggro.
