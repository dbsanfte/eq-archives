> Seriously, IMHO you should put the AE's away and concentrate on DD

My wizard likes to carry one AE, a targetted one.  (The point blank ones
(a) tend to attract new mobs (sometimes friendly ones like guards!) -- into
the fight, and (b) require that I be too close when I fire them off.  The
PBAE has its uses, but not in most combat.)  The targetted AE is for when
there are adds, and the melees are fighting 2 or more mobs.  Often it's
still best to concentrate damage on a single target and take it out, but
the AE does more total damage for the mana, so it's worth having the
option.

E.g., at level 20 my best nuke (Garrison's Mighty Mana Shock) does about
1.6 damage per mana.  The best AE (Pillar of Fire) does 0.9 damage per
mana to each target, so with 2+ targets it's doing more damage.  Even so,
I'll often not use it unless there are 3-4 targets, because with only 2
it's probably best to stick with killing one thing as fast as possible.
(With 3-4, I'll still be nuking the main target, but I'll throw in the
AE when waiting for the nuke to refresh.  I'm expecting to burn down my
mana bar in an overpull.)

One risk, of course, is that the AE will attract the attention of the
extra mobs.  (The primary target is presumably directing its aggro at
the main tank.)  But (a) if you're far enough away, they might not
come for you, and (b) if they do, at least you're helping pull them
off the tank. :-)
