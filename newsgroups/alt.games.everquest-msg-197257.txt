I had a similar problem as I spent a lot of time fear kiting. My offence and
2HB were maxed out (I used a Staff of Living Sand, very nice weapon) but
defence was too low for my liking.

To improve this go to Iceclad. Snare a cougar drag it to the edge and then
root it. Make sure you cast your Damage Shield and Regen on yourself and
then dot the cougar.

Charge in and start to fight. If you start to lose too many HPs then step
back and let regen restore some of your health. This way you control the
amount of fighting and can keep a careful eye on your mana / health.

Hope that Helps.
