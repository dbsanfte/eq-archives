My chanter is camped with a group outside of Karnors.  Have been for
an hour or two.  Guy soloing pulls over me.  Mob stops and hits me, my
pet engages, guy manages to pull the mob away.  I figure no big deal,
level 39 chanter pet obviously isn't going to KS and nothing I could
do about it anyway.

About 15 minutes later I get a tell from the guy that when he pulled
over me I should have invised and killed my pet, or else "the guy is
gonna think you are trying to steal from him".

Now I'm thinking that in all the years I've played EQ, with all the
self centered jerks I've run into, this could easily be a world's
record.  I'm supposed to kill my pet because it attacked the thing
that he trained on me???
