Vigor stacks with Fo7, so I did not count it in either case.
Boar is 60 STA which would be used rather than Stamina, and, again, 
stacks with Fo7 as well as Kragg/IoS.

As a shaman, I get about 3 HP per stamina, so, 135hp for 45 stamina, or 
540HP for Kragg/IoS.  Slightly less hp than Fo7, and costs an extra slot.

For melee classes (assuming stamina is not already maxxed out with Boar, 
also, STA over 255 gives reduced HP benefit) the HP per STA is higher, 
so, yes, they could end up with higher HP from that combo, depending on 
what their stamina is unbuffed.

The only buff you are bringing to the table HP wise is SV, shaman get 
both Kragg and IoS at a lower level than BLs do.

Casters will prefer BSS to SV, as it's more hp.  Melee will prefer SoT to 
SV as it's more ATK.

Now, for other BL buffs, I love SD.
