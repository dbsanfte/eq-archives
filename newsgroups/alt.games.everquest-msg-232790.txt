A zero-second stun has the same aggro generation as an 8 second stun.  And
any aggro generation is more than a ranger needs - rangers can generate
aggro pretty much at will anyway.

Bards get dual wield.  Rangers get dual wield and double attack and kick.
Rogues have dual-wield and double-attack as well as backstab.  In the same
timeslice a bard can execute 2 attacks, a ranger or rogue can get off five
(assuming same quality of weapons, level, etc., etc.).  Don't be surprised
if you can't hold aggro if a ranger isn't jolting or the rogue's evade
fails!  One little proccy-toy isn't going to make THAT much of a difference.

But for a ranger - who often rides the aggro curve just behind the MT, doing
as much damage as possible without *quite* getting aggro - the aggro spike
of a stun procc can spin a mob.  This goes from irrelevant (XP group, cleric
has plenty of mana) to annoying (XP group, healer is low on mana) to bad
(raid, fifty hasted rogues and monks take riposte damage) to horrible (raid,
fifty hasted rogues and monks take Enrage).

The time to learn how to play a class properly is BEFORE you're on a raid
and can wipe it from being clumsy.
