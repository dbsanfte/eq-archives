I wont' be buying a new card (my NEXT computer will have a Geforce
card) so I'll just twiddle my thumbs till they figure out how to get
voodoo 3 cards working. And if they never do that and instead insist I
get a new card whether or not I actually wanted the upgrade (I will
more than likely never want Luclin graphics no matter what), then I
start ranting and foaming :)
