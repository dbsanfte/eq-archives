No, they don't.  I think you are confusing the law with the current
applications of that law.  Just because the law is only used to
protect gays, lesbians, and bisexuals now does not mean that its
protection does not extend to straights, nor does it mean that it
won't be needed to protect straights from discrimination in the
future.

> But there IS no equality.  That is my point.

You are right, there is no true equality in western societies.  The
best we acheive is an enforcement of equality, usually after the fact.
Your arguement that anti-discrimination laws promote inequality fails
to hold water, no matter how often you repeat it.  The status quo
remains that in our UNequal society such laws are among the few tools
to protect ourselves against discrimination.

No.  That's all I can say, "no".   I don't think you have any
understanding of this issue at all.

laws
> that throw such differences up in our face??

Equality will not be acheived by masking everyone as being "the same".
Equality will be acheived by accepting everyone as being different but
with equal rights.  Anti-discrimination laws simply state that,
despite our differences, we have equal rights under the law.

With few exception we do.  You are the one who insists on seeing them
as UNEQUAL.  They are certainly incomplete in many places, but that is
another issue.

> REASON, you are breaking the law...

Actually that is far from the truth and highlighths your lack of
understanding.  If  you lose a job because your boss doesn't like you,
is that anti-EQ discrimination?  Can you sue?   Was it wrong?   Just
because you feel it was discrimination does not mean a court will
agree.  Unless you are able to show that your boss (a) broke a law, or
(b) went against precedent and/or accepted practices, you are out of
luck.  In a recent case (sorry, I forgot the state) a judge denies
custody on the basis of homosexuality- a LEGAL discrimination in that
state.

> Rich, poor, black, white, gay, straight.. Do you know why the statue

Yes.  Most justice deities (usually female) have been portrayed as
"blind" and thus symbolically objective since pre-historic times.
The scale is an equally old symbol.

No, those barriers already existed.  Anti-discrimination laws are a
tool to use when a barrier acts against you.

> Period??

You keep missing the point.  IT IS UNENFORCABLE.  Most bills/codes of
rights start with a generic statement like yours, but go on to specify
types of discrimination simply because generic statement do not work.
They have existed for a long time yet we still arrived at a need for
specific anti-discrimination statements.  If nothing else that is
testimony to the fact that simple blanket statements are not
sufficient.

You discussed most of this thread with repeated referenced to "the
PC".   You have few grounds to talk about boxing people in!
Seriously, while it was not my intent to label you out of hand, this
sub-thread is about you: your insistent statements that some laws
grant "special rights".  Since it is about your (mistaken) belief,
don't be surprised that it becomes about you now and then.

> I talk about the wonders of equality, because it truly is wonderful.

You talk philosophy, which is great.  I'm talking about the real
world.

Typo, "equality".

Why do you insist on thinking that "groups" are singled out instead of
types of discrimination?  You have it backwards!

Well get the chip off your shoulder.  I don't consider the US all that
enlightened to begin with, but you really shouldn't limit your world
view to a single country, much less a region within that country!   As
I have repeatedly said there are certainly laws that encourage
discrimination and/or that single out "special rights".  They are not
synonymous with ALL anti-discrimination laws.

> Now, if YOU say that all the laws are generic (as you mentioned
above)
> then I say that is a good start..

Not all, but most.   If you read various human rights delcerations
from around the world, the trend is to ban discrimination and grant
equality in all ways (generic statement) followed by some specific
definitons (for the sake of clarity and enforceability) and then a
statement that this list is not meant to be comprehensive (i.e. "and
everu thing else we didn't think to include").

> However, we then fall into the trap of leaving people out..

Which is what higher courts are for- some brave soul spends a lot of
time and money arguing the case, and the courts modify the law or
establish precedent as needed.

> DO you know what THAT says to me??
>

Yes, well, its pretty obvious that you are deliberately reading that
into it.   If you want to take any "you can't" rule to mean everything
else is allowed you will have some serious problems.

> Personally, I feel it's NOT ok to discriminate based on ANYTHING...
>
> But that is just me, I spose..

No, unfotunately many others share your lack of understanding of the
principles at play here.  That is why I de-lurked.  I hope to
understand how some people can be so blind.  Maybe then I will
understand why some people indirectly make my life harder by blocking
laws which could be of immense help to me.

> I am not into this THAT much...  :^)

But vocal people like you make it harder to pass these laws!  Maybe
you are not affected, but I am, so I am "into this".  On taxes alone
we could have saved thousands of dollars a few years ago before some
of your "special rights' come into effect!  Never mind the legal fees
from the powers of attorney.   Oh yeah, have you ever tried to get a
mortgage when you don't fit the lender's definition of "spouse"?

Like I keep saying, you have no understanding of this issue at all.  I
can list DIRECT and PERSONAL benefits to my life in the last ten years
which are directly as a result of anti-discrimination laws.  Get a
clue buddy, your attitude is making other people's lives harder.  Your
philosophy is great, but you know what they say about the road to
hell.
