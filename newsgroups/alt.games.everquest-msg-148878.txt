Well I say destroy because of the fact that you said, it's a game
which you wouldn't be interested in. There simply aren't enough people
who buy characters or would buy characters to keep the game populated
enough that it would be considered a good profit to their respective
company. I mean just look at most of the posts here in response, I'll
admit people who would buy characters most likely don't know enough
about their internet connection that they'd even know newsgroups exist
so they can't fairly represent their opinion here but still the whole
point of playing the game is to build up your
stats/equipment/money/faction whatever while your doing all the
playing. If you could just start out at lvl 60 with all AAs, all the
best equipment, and everything else done for you then there is simply
nothing left to do. You can join in on guild raids for the fun of
sitting there casting spells or hitting the a button and kick button
over and over but in the end you have the best equipment so there is
no need for loot, and you have every ability possibly open to your
character so there is no need to try to build up any experience, so
all you'd go for is the company of people in the guild so basically a
chat room. There are a lot of chat rooms around that don't cost 15
bucks a month. I know there are people who sell characters and start
that way but at some point someone had to work that character up or it
wouldn't be for sale so it wouldn't just be set by the company itself
as the best of everything. I'm just convinced if Verant started just
selling these maxed characters and let them interact with people who
actually worked for their character then most everyone would quit the
game, and after all the people who worked for their stuff are gone
there's no one left for the guys who bought their characters to have
an unfair advantage over therefore they'd quit as well.
