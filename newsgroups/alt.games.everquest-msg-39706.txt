The slowness is a direct result of your low HP.

The other fellow above probably had a very low latency connection.  I know a
monk with the same AGI as me (close enough, anyway).  We were both sowed by
the same druid and he consistently outran me (neither encumbered).  He knows
his connection well enough to know that he has very low latency, while I'm
on 56k in the boondocks and have a high latency.
