been lurking and watching this thread for awhile and thought I 'd put
in my two cents.  Both side have points to the positive.  As far as
the pro sony position.  Yes they did say they were going to up the
rate on a certain date, therefore pay the proper rate. If they screwed
up well shame on them.  On the other hand sony screwed up, take your
lumps and swallow the loss.  The cruel reality of the world is sony
has the money to say screw you all if you don't like it this is what's
going to happen.  As much as I hate that mentality, the corporate
world has the power to get what they want for the most part.  The only
way to force corps to follow the moral path is to hurt them in the
pocket.  The only way to do that is to convince enough people to quit
eq and not buy sony products, to hurt sony's bottom line.  Not gonna
happen, sucks for those of us who care about the moral and ethical
issues but that is the bottom line :(
