Took a while before it worked for me, but I got it pre-ordered last
night. It's 17.95 IIRC, when you pre-order, and will be something like
24 bucks US after the "special" price expires.

Apparently they will be e-mailing you a registration code to enter once
it's ready to go live. Still no sign of it on Test that I could find.
