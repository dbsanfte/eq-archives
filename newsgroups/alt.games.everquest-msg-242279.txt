   That's pretty much how I feel about this.  Yeah, the cleric messed up.  Yes,
he should have had the spells.  But we're talking about a mess up at level 20,
not level 50.  What with the accelerated leveling curve at younger levels, I
feel that level twenty is more like 7 used to be.  Is this a good thing?  Well,
probably not.  But it is the way things now, and shaking your finger at the
current wave of newbies and saying "In my day it took time to get to level 20
and we knew what we were doing when we got there!" isn't going to help things at
all.  

   Of course this is frustrating, and the cleric needed a little wake up call. 
But tearing him a new asshole?  Over a what, 15% or 25% percent rez in the
twenties?  This exp could be made up in 3 or 4 kills.  If I were that guy, I
would have probably put the worst of you on ignore.  Everyone does make
mistakes, and if people can't accept that maybe they shouldn't be playing a
multiplayer game.
