Gawd no man, this applies to all 50 and above (well according to a
highly unreliable sorce...verant)  and without seeing the hard data no
one cant say for sure. 

Common tactic of GMs (or anyone dealing with people) is nerf something
to hell, and when the players uproar reaches the danger point back it
down to somethng better but still nerfed when compared to original.
The sheep will continue to believe they won...the ones that dont...
heh ya didnt want them anyway  :)

Can you say "Bahhhhhh" boys and girls?
