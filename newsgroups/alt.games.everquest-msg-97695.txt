I really don't see the issue here,

If you're in a group where you are main tank and must work hard to maintain
agro, say in a party full of enthusiastic casters, then asking for a med
break is perfectly reasonable. I'd expect such a group is going to be
taking such breaks for one reason or another.

If you're in a group where you have a warrior, or a lot of other melee
characters, then lighten up on the DoT's and let the warrior take the
agro. The warrior can take it and, as you say, they're not exactly huge
damage. On the other hand if you get a bad pull, and can use FD to avoid
bringing it to the party, that's a *massive* gain. In such a case you're
not using FD to split, but to avoid `oops' pulls.

And, personally, some SK's are a little too spell happy anyway. Using
mana and time to cast a spell that's not a whole heap more efficient
than simply taking another wack at the thing.
