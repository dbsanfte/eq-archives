I'm not at all sure what you mean by "RANGE", unless you're reading

something into James' post that I sure don't see.  In fact, what
you suggest above: "the 'base' buy and sell values are separate for
the items", is precisely what James' "built-in min and max price"
refers to.  I mean, James is a tad imprecise in his wording, but I
at least had no difficulty understanding that he was refering to the
min[imum] price a vendor will charge for the item and the max[imum]
price a vendor will pay for the item.  There really doesn't seem to
be any other sensible way to read what he posted.
