hehe...this happens to my DE cleric.  There's not a single DE class that can
SOW.  AND she's only lvl 6, so even if she could, she couldn't. OH, and it
happens to my wood elf bard all the time, even though i'm singing away at
the time, and those little glowing orbs are flying all around.  Makes one
wonder if they even look at what class you are before begging.  *sigh*
