Easiest way?  

Burn/backup his EQ directory and sub-directories to a series of CDs. 
Reformat the machine and install/patch apps - DON'T worry about EQ.
Copy the files from the backup CDs to an everquest directory.
Remove the read-only attributes from these files (since you copied 'em
back from CD they may be marked read-only).
Create a shortcut on his desktop to uh...  I think eqgame.exe or some
similarily named executable.
Play EQ

Granted, that will use a few CDs...

Or, you could grab any .ini files in the EQ dir and stuff from the
\maps \uifiles and \logs directories I suppose.  But then you have to
reload EQ and go through all the patching again.  Patching from
install CDs could take a loooooOOOoooong time.
