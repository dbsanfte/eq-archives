I (mostly) soloed a Warrior to 32 in LOIO (Half Elf, no Haste, no Regen,
BABS and Silver Etched Warhammer were best weapons, Crafted plus Fine
Plate for armor) and I'm pretty sure I could've taken him into his 40s
(in OT) if I were a sufficiently patient masochist.  Possible and
pointless are not mutually exclusive.  The point of my Paladin example
was not that soloing was effective, but rather that he could survive an
add without fleeing.
