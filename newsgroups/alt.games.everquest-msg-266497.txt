I was skeptical myself, being in the SW:G beta and seeing how they utterly
failed to bring a quality game to market. While I only was able to play for
about two hours what I did see impressed me more than being in that beta.
My only complaint so far is the sneaky way they make it seem that the only
option for subscription is the full pass. I think it should be made more
clear that regular subscription options are available by pressing 'No
thanks'.
