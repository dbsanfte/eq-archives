I decided to progress to a second tier to see if
the second shroud went up in power and ability
and desirability (let's face it, the beginning shrouds
at level 70 are pretty lackluster).

I chose undead, mainly because the second shroud
is a zombie, and I thought that might look cool.  I did
the progression as a level 20 shroud (skeleton wizard)
in Scarlet Desert (hot zone) being PL'd by a 70 cleric.
I made 1% of progression for about every 4 kills at the
zoneline from Twilight.  I'd say it took about 6-7 hours
of gameplay (spaced out over several days, man that's boring).
Normally I'm a level 70 character, and after I was done
with this progression through the shroud, I'd made right
around 3 AA's (yes 100% aa exp).  Not as much as I'd
make in the same time through normal play, obviously, but
still better than I'd expected.

So the second undead shroud is a zombie warrior.  Yeah
playing as a zombie is kinda cool.  For about 10 minutes.
Nobody in POK even glanced in my direction as I turned
Run off and shambled around the crowded zone.  Oh well.

As a level 70 shroud, the zombie warrior has about 4900 hps
unbuffed.  Around 1500 AC.  No armor to put on, no weapon
to use.  Barehanded claw attacks seemed to hit for a max around
300 damage.  Had some abilities to use to maintain aggro, but I didn't
attempt to use the monster in a "real" situation.  How could you?  One
draw for this expansion was that you could use these shrouds to
"fill in" a needed class for your group.  Could the above warrior
possibly play as tank for a group of level 70's in MPG or Riftseeker's
or....anywhere?!

The shrouds have some use for people that want to "level down" and
group with a lower level friend, I suppose.  But someone else is
going to have to provide evidence that they have any use at all in
the higher end game, because I sure don't see it.
