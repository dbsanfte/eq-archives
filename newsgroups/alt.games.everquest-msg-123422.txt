Or more likely I was watching the discussion and noticed mention of
something that was impossible and couldn't pass up responding to it. 
Particularly since it involved one of my favorite things to debate, the
goofiness of the Ragefire camp.

Or did you miss the actual point of that statement, that having a
druid/ranger friend was just as good as running showeq for something like
Ragefire?

Umm...  your cleric friend has a druid friend, obviously, but it sounds like
he needs a hella lot more friends if you've had Ragefire spawn on you more
than once.  Only takes once, and the cleric shouldn't have to set foot in
Skyfire ever again if they don't want to.

I'm sorry, you seem to think that you've proven a point.  The only thing
you've proven is the ridiculousness of the camp and the ineptness of your
cleric friend who's managed to get spawned on 4 times before getting
Ragefire (please tell me that the cleric actually *has* gotten Ragefire...).

And did you try and assert that Ragefire didn't spawn for two weeks
straight?  Quite possible, I guess.  I know at one point the spawn was
literally broken, as in it would spawn and poof instantly or maybe just
never spawn.  Lots of mobs are like this for various reasons.  Go check out
the Hollowshade wars and see just how badly Verant can screw up
pathing/scripting.  When a spawn is working, though, it has a pattern.

Yep.  Like all the rest of the mobs in the game.  Once you figure them out.
