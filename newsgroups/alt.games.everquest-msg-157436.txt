I have to admit, this is annoying.

I've been away from the game for about 5-6 months.  Last week, I had some
vacation, so I bought a bunch of parts, built myself a new computer, and
installed EQ, just to see what it would look like with all the fancy
graphics turned on and the new interface.  I kinda liked it, found a new
zone to hunt in, and decided to start playing again.

Monday morning?  Patching.
Monday night?  Patching.  Still, I got SOME play in...

Tuesday morning?  Patching
Tuesday night?  Patching.

I finally got on with just an hour to go before bed, and found out the HARD
way that VI had nerfed one of the few Druid spells remaining that was
actually useful. (Harmony)  I died.  I lost all the experience I had gained
since coming back, and more.

Wednesday morning?  Patching.

So, they're still nerfing anything thing they feel like with no warning
whenever a spell or ability becomes inconvenient to them, with the ultimate
nerf being taking all the servers down because just our playing the GAME is
inconvenient to them.

Why am I paying these people again?
