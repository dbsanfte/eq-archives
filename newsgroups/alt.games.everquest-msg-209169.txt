  Sorry to break it to you, melee damage never causes an additional
check for root breaking. Weapon procs, yes 

  I'm surprised that there's any debate on this subject it's pretty
trivial to see ingame. Group with a fast dual wielder that doesn't
have procing weapons and see how often root breaks compared to just
root parking a mob. Now group with a dual wielder that has procing
weapons. The difference is night and day.
