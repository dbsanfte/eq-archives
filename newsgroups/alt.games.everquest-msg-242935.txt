ROTFLMAO, and Mith Marr is not a seriously *good* diety?

I had killed at last count almost 10k critters in the warrens, every 
time I needed to go to Guthank for whateer reason I would kill my way 
through...any time I had a spare half an hour or so and didnt want to do 
anything particular I would go clear the warrens. Took me 3 months, but 
I am at last amiable=) so it *can* be done. You just have to commit 
genocide=)
