Actually, I think they come across much better than FoH.  They did the two 
months of boring camping to get all the key, make all the weapons, 
whatever.  Now they are going to pharm that fucking snake until someone 
else can get there.  I think a single obscene statement of Wraaaath! is 
merited after completing something like this.
I've always had quite a bit of respect for Triton though, maybe because I 
spent a lot of time in PoM, thanks to their work.
