Hubby played EQ2 at E3 two years ago.  He made a character and got to slay
Nagafen.  But he said it was really more of a tech demo than anything else.
He said it looked absolutely gorgeous and more than likely would go over to
EQ2.  I am curious about EQ2 myself.

Now I'm gonna have to go watch Donnie Darko.  We have the director's cut.
