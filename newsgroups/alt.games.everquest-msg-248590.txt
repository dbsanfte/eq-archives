}The file should be located in folder: 
}      EverQuest\uifiles\default 
}Also the installer on the CD's might be bugged, some versions of the installer
}dropped the files into different folders. Search for more than one instance of
}EverQuest folder. ( Sometimes C:\Prgram Files\Sony\Everquest instead of C:\Program
}Files\EverQuest\ or vice versa )

Hmm, another thought:  this is a file for the UI.  If you have it set to 
use a custom UI, it could be looking for the file in the wrong directory, 
or something...  There's some way to set that in the eqclient.ini or the 
UI_<charname> files as I recall... make sure it's default. :)
