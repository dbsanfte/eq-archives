Ok, so is this thing for real... I just got an invite to San Francisco
from EA... It was an email, saying they were giving me an all expenses
paid trip to san francisco to see their new games.  Apparently the
feature game is Ultima X: Online.  I dont really know anything about
the game, but the flash invite looks cool... So what is the deal with
this thing... Am i just really lucky, or is there some huge catch...
Here is the email, please tell me what you think.


It's my pleasure to invite you, an influential member of 
the online gaming community, to an exclusive preview of a 
groundbreaking new EA game. Ultima X: Odyssey is the next 
evolution of online gaming. We think it is the most 
innovative new MMORPG of the year -- and you can be among 
the first to see it!

This special event will be held in San Francisco on 
August 21-22, 2003.  Domestic airfare and lodging will be 
provided!  The details are confidential until you register. 

To attend, please register at:
