I have that same problem but the only thing we have in common hardware wise
is the sb audigy.

My specs are

P4 2.53 ghz
motherboard is asus p4c800-deluxe
512mb pc2700 ram (single stick)
asus branded geforce2 mx agp-v7100 32mb
sb audigy2 platinum
directx 9.0b

It also just occured to me, looking at your drive.
the drive its installed on is an IBM 60 gig but i also have a 200gb wd in my
system.

I dont think outside software is the culprit in my case, infact i just
assumed it was my outdated video card having to catch up but seeing your
post on a *new* card makes me wonder.

This *RARELY* happens for me, but i have noticed it on occasion, it seems to
happen in pok. and i think it happened once in dulak.
