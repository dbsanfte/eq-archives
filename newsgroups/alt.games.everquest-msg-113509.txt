The original game was given out in a magazine for free, so no I could not
have known that the expansions would have been different - I did not expect
them to be free, but I would have expected that if someone relinquishes
their right to play the game, I should be able to "buy" these rights. To go
back to my example - how would you feel if you were treated the same if you
bought a second hand car ?

Hardly role-play, isn't it ??? somehow I don't see myself shouting in Gfay -
Hey Can I buy the expansions from Ebay ?

which I was not aware.

I am not admitting to anything. I find this system exceedingly clever from
Verant, because it forces players to buy the originals. But that does not
mean it does not contravene with my rights as a consumer to purchase
second-hand goods. And Verant are just doing that.

All in all, the Ebay seller is going to refund the money anyway, and I will
order EQ gold from Amazon - I should be able to keep my character after all.

Thx for your constructive comments !
