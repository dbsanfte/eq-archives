Hmmm...I had a feeling this might be the case, but since bard's mana gets
absolutely no effect from any type of clarity I wasn't sure.  That's the
only group-related song I can think of that I have (so far) that doesn't
have an icon, so it's impossible to measure against.
Anyway, if that's the case, I'm not playing "mana-song only" and avoiding my
typical haste/str/mr....or whatever combination I may be using to help the
rest of the group.  That seems a little much of a deficit to sit back and
jerk off the casters in an otherwise balanced group.
They don't, however, seems to bitch when I play chorus and canatana during a
bit of downtime to pump them up.

Sean...
