That makes your comment about speeding up performance for those with slower
connections more than a little ludicrous, numbnuts.  How fast do you want
your trader to...  sit there?

Or you are too simple minded to figure it out based on the numerous clues,
or to do the *simple* research with someone having a problem to figure out
what they are doing that leads up to that problem.  There are only so many
things you can do while in Bazaar before walking away from your trader for
the day.

Just tossing out a recent example...

Zone crashing.  Not fixed until some people started "spreading the word" so
that everyone knew how to do it.  *Then* it's a problem worth fixing.

The list of exploitable bugs that have been fixed *only* after they get out
to the masses is long.  The zone crashing to get mobs to respawn (or to stop
someone else from getting to a mob) is a recent one that wasn't fixed until
it got out to the masses and became a rampant problem.  The problem itself
had existed for months, and in fact I realized that I myself had probably
crashed zones in the past on accident without realizing that what I was
doing was a guaranteed way to get the zone to crash.
