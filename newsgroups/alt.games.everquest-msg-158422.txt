Well, that's a bit more decent, but the ratio still seems silly to me
when I see how fast I can kill a mob.  Then again, during a higher-end
raid, should I presume that if the mob is alive long enough for me to
do full damage, we're dead? :)  It often seems (when Martin is
providing his play-by-plays in s.age) that once engaged, the whole
fight lasts like, what, a minute?

Okay, I must ask.  Why do they yell at you for the mob turning into a
skelly?  Nice DD btw, but how's the aggro on it?  I stopped using the
poison DD because I almost always got instant aggro, no matter when I
used it.  Haven't used it since I started soloing again but then, who
needs to?  Fear, three dots and a lifetap if my health is suffering
and that sucker is dead while I med.

Not me.  They'll get a nice view of my ass on the way out the door
though :)

Ryou
(doesn't mind twitching during downtime, mind you, but danged if I'm
going to sit there being a mana bitch while everybody else gets to
kill ;p)
