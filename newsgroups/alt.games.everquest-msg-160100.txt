Yeah it's a spell
There is no item. Anyone can do the quest but only an enchanter can use the
resulting spell (which is droppable)

And it's fairly useless... I still am kos to iksar with it up. And I'm not a
goody god enchanter either
They respond as much to religion as appearance, and I don't think you can be
an enchanter that worships Cazic Thule.
I have a cleric of Brell Dwarven Friend that always asks me to bring him
stuff, and when I ask where, he says meet at Cabalis Bank ... he managed to
get non-kos... but it took monstrous effort.
