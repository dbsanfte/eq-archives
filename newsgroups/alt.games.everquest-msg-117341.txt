I soloed the Ghoul Messenger at 28 and he was very tough; he took
me down to one bubble of health.  He might have killed me if he
hadn't stopped punching me to cast Root every so often.

The main problem with this quest is that the Ghoul Messenger
is an infrequent spawn, (West Karana near the North K zone).
You could spend many hours in the area and not see him at all.
I was travelling down the West K shoreline and hitting Track
from time to time as is my habit, when he showed up.  He led
me on a merry chase, (he is QUICK!) and he attacked me when
I got close.

The Short Sword of Morin is 6/22 with no stats - not that great
a weapon.  I used mine for only a level or two before getting
something better.  :-/
