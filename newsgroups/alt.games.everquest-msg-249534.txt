As a former long timer of Vallon Zek all I can say is that your changes
while needed to keep the whole Team PvP concept alive are totally impossible
in light of the way that the PvE is structured in EQ as a whole,
particularly at the high end. The teams are not even close to balanced,
aside from Human team. At the highend game you simply HAVE to have
representation from almost all of the classes, in fact I cant think of a
single class ( aside From Druid Pfft :P ) thats not a must have / REALLY
need class, for taking on the high end content.

And lets not forget why the whole x-teaming started in the first place ( at
least on Vallon.. cant speak to Tallon ). The Dark team was massively
dominate, and the 3 light teams had to band together in order to survive at
all, and once your 3 teaming, its a real small conceptual leap to add in the
4th team.

On top of all this lets not even mention that PvP ( regardless of ruleset )
at the high levels ( 58+ for our worlds to be exact ) is such an utter farce
that its not even funny. There is NO way that a VT / NToV geared person is
going to stand any chance in hell against any of the time geared / "aa's out
the ass" toons that are out there.

No, the sad truth is that the PvP that was implemented in EQ is suffucuently
broken as to be irreparable with out fixing the PvE.
