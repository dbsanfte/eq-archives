My report:
Shanai (the button girl) in Shar Vahl is bugged she doesn't complete
the quest properly. I followed her like I was told, and she never
tells the father I am home. He then glowers at you when you hand him
the buttons even though she is standing right there. It also tells me
faction gets better when I am actually trashing faction.

I decided to kill her and take her nightie but dad was none too
pleased. Ow.
