All my experiencing was done with friends, usually on their own alts. In
the HoH grouping we did we had one of my friend's 65 shamans outside
group buffing and slowing and with ferine avatar on I'd say my dps was
relatively respectable. The other members were 65 war as tank, the war's
then 54 cleric, another 2 friends mid 50's monk and another friend's mid
50's sk.

Actully I wouldn't even want an under 65 warrior in PoV. Unless he was
uber twinked, and even then, he'd be a nasty mana sponge. I've met a mid
60 warrior on my server while leveling an alt who had stopped doing
normal experience to add aa just so they could stand a decent chance at
tanking PoV level mobs. When I was leveling my main, a cleric, in PoV
after PoP came out, the difference between a 62 war and a 65 in a back
caves group was night and day. The only low 60's tanks that did a decent
job back then that I noticed were the ones with 100+ aa of defensive
abilities, which you're unlikely to find lfg in PoV at this point in the
game except for the ones like the previously mentioned warrior who
specifically stopped leveling to gain more. I remember playing with the
same warrior twice in back caves in early PoP, once when he was 62 then
a week later when he was 65. I actually asked him if he'd gotten any
significant gear upgrades in between the time we'd last played together
as his ability to sponge up damage was that noticably better.
