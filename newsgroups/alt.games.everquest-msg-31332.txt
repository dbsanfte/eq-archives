Fun in High Pass tonight.  Being a level 16 chanter, I got in a 16-19
group fighting on the orc side, and we were lucky enough to have all
the orcs to ourselves. After a while, lag deaths descend upon us, and
our numbers are cut by a few, so we get a few more pickups.
   We hunt again, this time without a cleric and my mezzes are now
being broken, left, right and center.  I ask the group if anyone
hasn't worked with a chanter before, my standard line when this
happens. One of the newcomers replies, "personlaly I HATE CHANTERS.
MEZ THIS, MEZ THAT. JUST SHUTUP AND FIGHT".
   I am pissed off by this, understandably.  However, what pissed me
off more was the complete lack of response by anyone else in the
group.  I left pretty quickly.

  Just curious - anyone else out there annoyed by chanters?  Any
chanters get the same reaction in a group? Did I do the right thing?
I now feel guilty about abandoning them..
