Pets do damage based on either their native damage or their weapon, 
whichever is better (the formula for max damage a pet does with a weapon 
is something like Damage*2+1)

At very low levels, this is pretty easy to get, a rusty halberd can be 
purchased for a gold or so, which has a damage rating of ten, this would 
mean the pet will do as much as 20 points a blow; normally a level 4 pet 
might only do 8 points a blow.

Pets completely ignore the delay on a weapon, so a really crappy weapon 
with a delay of 10/50 is no better or worse than a nice one with a 10/20.

Once you hit level 12 or so, you'll find it becomes really expensive to 
raise a pet's damage output any higher than his "native" damage; weapons 
with damage ratings higher than 10 aren't all that common.

For quite a while, then, giving weapons to pets becomes a matter of 
style at best.  Eventually, though, pets become able to dual weild; to 
swing more than one weapon at a time.  For most pets, there's a period 
where they will only do this if they actually have two weapons, so 
giving them a pair will add significantly to their number of swings per 
minute (not doubling it, as they still have to succede with their dual 
weild checks, more on the order of 1/3rd)

Some pets get to the point where they "dual weild" using their "fists" 
or whatever their native gear is, others, like the shaman pets, never 
do.  Its ALWAYS worthwhile to give a shaman pet (over level 40 or so, 
whenever it is that they first start dual weilding) a couple weapons, 
even if its nothing more than two rusty daggers.

Others have mentioned the proccing weapons, and the haste mask.  Other 
things that can help are armor (usually not worth it unless its summoned 
armor which comes cheap)and gear with HP or stats (again, summoned is 
probably the only way to go)  Raise your pet's HP and he'll live longer 
if you're having trouble keeping him healed.  Give him a lot higher AC 
and he'll take less damage. Give him a higher dex and he'll proc his 
weapons more often, so on and so forth.

Think of that summoned gear as permanent buffs that stack with whatever 
you can cast on him.
