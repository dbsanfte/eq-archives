Very interesting observations for me who isn't diving in until next week 
together with my best friend.

Something I had to wonder about while reading this was, are the chat 
channels really very busy with rapidly scrolling text if they include 
the whole server or all instances in a given zone? It seems like that 
would be a problem in prime time.

I have a feeling the grouping gets much better once one gets higher in 
levels. Like you said, how much grouping really goes on EQ1 for the 
first 10 levels, especially if you are constantly trying out new toons, 
etc. You don't have the chance to really get to know anyone yet.

A big concern for me is when I log in, I want to be able to go where my 
friends are, my best friend in particular who is planning to play some 
weeknights with me for a time, while we give this a go. You'd think 
after three years, they'd have recognized the need for this to be easy 
and implemented something that makes it so. I hope they have.

You have some interesting points about the isolation of individuals in 
the game given the factions and instancing in the world. On the other 
hand, doesn't the design of the game mean few servers with very large 
populations so that this balances out to be approximately the same in 
the end as playing on a smaller server, such as in EQ? I think I 
understand what you are saying though. That in this huge world with 
these divisions, making friends and staying in touch with them is 
hindered by the design.

But maybe it just appears this way in the beginning. You'd think an 
MMORPG would facilitate the building of relationships with others as 
desired and not make it difficult or even impossible. Perhaps this is 
yet something else that cannot really be discerned fully until one has 
played to higher levels.

On the other hand, my best friend in EverQuest is someone I met on day 
one in GFay and we've played together on and off and stayed in touch 
ever since. It was day one for him too. We did play those first levels 
together all the time. He's a High Elf Paladin and I a High Elf Cleric, 
so we made a good pair and picked up others here and there as we went. I 
don't know any of the people I met in GFay then anymore all this time 
later but I still know him. I wonder how that would have played out in a 
world like you describe in AO.

Anyway, I am looking forward to seeing for myself next week. I've really 
enjoyed reading the impressions you guys have as you report back to the 
rest of us. Great reading and thanks a lot for sharing all this info.
