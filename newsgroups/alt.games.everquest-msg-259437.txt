This is just as true with DSL.

Just how many megabits do you need to send those commands to dodge and 
punch? Think bout it. Then get a traffic monitor and -measure- it. Its 
not much.

Around here cable has better scalability. In fact I can't get 1 mbps 
upload from the local dsl providers, but I can with cable.

Carved in stone at 1mbps up, and 5 down at the moment. I can live with 
that.

Yeah you can't run the google server out of your basement, and if you 
load kazaa and upload 24x7x365 at full tilt they'll cut you off. Guess 
what, DSL is no different.

Neither company will blink if you host a game of unreal.

Here's that old cable is a giant lan theory again. It was true 5 years 
or more ago. Its not true anymore unless your ISP is running very 
antique infrastructure.
