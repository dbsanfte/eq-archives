Good God, yes.  I gave up after the seventh book.  The first three books
were *so* good.  Then Robert Jordan realized he was riding a cash cow and
slowed the plot progression to an infitesimal crawl.  That's my
interpretation, anyway.

When the series finally comes to an end I may pick it up from the beginning
and read it again.  Then again, I may not.  Right now I'm waiting for George
R.R. Martin's next book - now *there's* a good series.
