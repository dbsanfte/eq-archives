You should forget about the AC, it will matter little to you later, and
beside you shouldnt get hit at all, well very little anyway, and when u do
get hit, the AC will make little change..... = )

Go for WIS items, but you need your most important spells when u level,
remember that. So dont spent all so u cant get your spells at level 24.

If you are in a guild with just a few higher level people, they could run
get you a E Stone Mace form Yaka in Greater Dvide, quite easy to get. When
you get a few levels u can go to FM and try get some Forest Loops, who know
you might be lucky. So i wouldnt spent money on a better weapon or earrings
just now.

I would say best advice is make sure u can get your spells, if this is your
first char you might not be able to get all your spells everytime u level,
so ask someone out before u run buy them. (mainly the Buffs and heal spells,
depending on how u play your char and what u like doing)

You could always do a /w all CLERIC 45 60 (or some othe combination) and
send some one a tell, ask him/her a few questions about what to do.....
Brell Serillis knows we clerics get a lot of tells anyway, just be polite
and i am sure most cleric will help u out. It is in the nature of clerics.

Just an old Vicar of Brell Serillis,
