Well perhaps you would better understand it re-written like this:
The planes are located in another place, not part of the "real" world at
all.
Massive magical forces are required to access them and only wizards have
the patience to master these skills.

OR 

Well perhaps you would better understand it re-written like this:
EQ is a game that is all about grouping.
In order to encourage grouping the "Vision" forces reliance on other
classes and races.

OR

Well perhaps you would better understand it re-written like this:
EQ is not quake where you finish one area then go to the next.
On entering EQ you are expected to immerse yourself in their reality.
Random "magical" requirements are all part of the "suspension of
disbelief"

OR

Well perhaps you would better understand it re-written like this:
If you didn't need a wizard to get to Hate how would a wizard ever find
a group there ?
:-P

I'm sure that I could re-write it a few more ways for you, but I hope
that you get the point.

HTH
