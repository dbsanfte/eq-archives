The fact that SOE has great trouble with this really has me shaking my

Well, patching on Wednesday evening (in Australia) is guaranteed to
ensure the EQ never takes off here. The worst night of the week for
content on free to air TV and SOE always puts on the patch. Heck, I'm

on a new cat. At least it would be more reliable. Open a tin of cat food
and cat magically appears. {:-)
