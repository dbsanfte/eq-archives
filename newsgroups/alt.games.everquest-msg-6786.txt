when fighting tough mobs u want to surround the mod with tanks  and hit from
all sides.  this has  seveal benefits:
-when hitting from the  back u do more damage
-roques do way  more  damage when hitting from  back
-it  tends to keep the monster in one place
-u can  see  who the  monster is aggroed on
-certain mob discs on work  on thos  in  front of them ie riposte type discs
