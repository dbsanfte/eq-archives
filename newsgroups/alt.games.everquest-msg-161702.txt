 Note the part where I put in about the rogues should have
better weapons by then...not many rogues would give
up a Tendonslicer for a Willsapper, especially if they HAVE
to keep their epic for off-hand because they don't have an
equivalent haste item yet or just can't lose the ATK bonus...

I think I send in a /bug report twice a week that Ragebringer
can't go range-slot yet, though...
