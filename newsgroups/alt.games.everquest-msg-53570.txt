Mobs pulled from static points will port back to there spawn location if
they lose aggro/sight in some zones . This is really common for the giants
in the huts in dreadlands.

If you camp out in a spot you are displaced a small amount in the west
direction . If you do this repeatedly and are on a western wall you will
slip completely through the geometry . To keep people from falling through
the geometry and then petitioning anyone who falls through the world is now
sent to the safe location in the zone . What happened was that you fell
through and where ported to the zones safe spot before you actually had
control. this by the way is a often abused bug ( say sploit :p)
