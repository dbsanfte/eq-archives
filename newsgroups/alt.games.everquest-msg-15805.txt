I hope you have luck, as grouping is certainly always better. Particularly for
a tank. But should you get really stuck for grouping options and want to get
out of hell, consider this:  I solo'd my way through 35 in three playing
sessions in Najena on the top floor with my warrior. Just bring a metric
buttload of bandages with you and be prepared to bribe lowbie magicians out in
Lavastorm for more summoned ones. Once you find the four spawn points of the
new quest skeletons you can keep fighting just about nonstop, and the other
mobs on that level of the dungeon won't aggro on you.
  There's some gypsies out in Lavastorm where you can sell you loot, unless
your evil, in which case you can just run up the zone wall to the temple of
Sol Ro and use the merchant up on the balcony. I made a couple hundred plat
that way while leveling.
Good luck.
