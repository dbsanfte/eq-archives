First of all Paladins are only just soloable.  Furthermore it is not only
fair.  If you decide to play a class that is group oriented then that puts
you at a disadvantage to soloing because the class is designed that way.
You will find that most of the classes in EQ that are difficult to solo are
ones that in traditional fantasy did not solo, and the ones that can solo
did in traditional fantasy.  But soloing is only for leveling.  Once you get
to level 60 there is absolutely no reason to solo, apart from perhaps making
cash.  So basically you are saying all soloable classes just because they
can solo should not exist at the end game.  Like where is the logic in that?
Can I remind you this is EVERquest.

How about we give warriors this ability that when they fall below 20% life
they hit for twice the damage, take half the damage the mobs give them, and
their speed increases to jboot speed so they can solo easier, but it only
happens if they are not grouped, and we take away their defensive disc for
raids?  Would all the warriors be happy?  Why not?  It seems to me that in
your opinion if a class was soloable then it shouldn't have to worry about
what their value is at the high end.
