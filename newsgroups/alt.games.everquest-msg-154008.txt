Chicken Little or Troll. I'm not sure which you are. What I don know
is that I now feel so much better about any nerfs, even those
affecting my own classes, now that I see the grief they have given
you. You appear to be nothing more than an easily-excitable, spoiled,
short-sighted person with a hair trigger temper, prone to tantrums
such as this.

The best defense against people like you is to feed the fire until you
burn out, and burn out you will. It's your nature.
