Nope, as you say it's been changed to non-vendor. No one has any information
on it and I frankly suspect that it's not even in the game at the moment. It
will probably be a rare drop from an uber-mob like Illusion Vah Shir or the
result of a quest that you'll never be able to do at anywhere near the level
you'd get the spell like Illusion Iksar.
