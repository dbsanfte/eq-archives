Cept that's not what he meant.  He was talking about where does all the big
plat come from in the first place.  It has to come from Merchants, or fall
from MOBs.  The plat that exchanges hands had to come from somewhere before
it started moving from player to player.  Since most of us don't see that
much actual cash fall off MOBs it must come from Merchant sold items, but
what could generate that much cash, that wouldn't be sold to other players
instead? So the question is a good one.  Where does plat come from?
