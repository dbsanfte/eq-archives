Didn't Verant give out a percentage of how much of the game has
experienced so far?  Something that reflected the percentage of quests
completed, items discovered, recipes completed, and mobs encountered?  I
could have sworn I'd seen it somewhere.  Does anyone know it?  And does
anyone think Verant should start posting these numbers on the web site?
I personally think it might be detrimental to the game but maybe not.
If everyone is running around comparing lists of items and quests and
getting spoilers like they do already and start comparing their numbers
to the numbers VI puts out, maybe avenues to new things would open
faster.  But then it becomes a rat race to discover new cool things.  I
guess it wouldn't matter because they are already people out there who
do just that, i.e. by everything they can, put it in a toolbox and hit
combine until something new pops out.  And those people don't affect the
game play for anyone else, they make the game better for everyone else.
Just a thought I had.
