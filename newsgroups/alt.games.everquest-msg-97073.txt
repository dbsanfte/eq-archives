Actually, none of you worked as hard for your levels as those of us
who started at release - Should I be pissed at every shmuck who comes
along and has a vastly easier time of it due to -

Old server economies
A death penalty that is 1/2 of what it used to be.
A spell book that didn't go away - EVER
a 40% hybrid xp penalty on my bard.

Lots of played time.  The amount of played time to get to
60 isn't gonna go down much.  I started a mage on a new
server a while back, abandoning many characters on my
old server to play with RL friends.  I leveled my mage - 
untwinked - to 20 in about a day played.  30 was 2.5 days.  
50 was 25 days.  They're accelerating levels that are 
INCREDIBLY easy for experienced players.

So, what do you learn in 35 levels of not being able to see during 
combat?  I learned never to make another caster.  I was only able
to practice pet control by standing up, and NOT medding, which reduces
my value to a group.  There are lots of casters who can learn to 
do things like ghetto CC (root parking) by being able to see and be
ivolved in the fight.

Yes, 1-30 will be easier.  BUT, they were already easy.  BUT, people
got them by overcrowding outdoor zones, and never learning dungeon 
hunting skills.  NOW, the way to level faster and easier is to go to
low level dungeons, and learn said skills.

As someone who has played EQ for 3 years, I see mostly positives in
the changes.
