I joined my first few guilds to be close to friends, to have a single
channel to talk to them in.

As I went up in levels, I joined guilds so I could go on raids and be
part of the "end game."

Now that I've watched five or six guilds crumble out from under me,
I'm back to joining guilds for the purpose of being close to my
in-game friends.
