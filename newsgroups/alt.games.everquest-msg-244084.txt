Do a search of the newsgroup on "Everquest and Winxp" (I used "XP"
only) and you should find a thread from 2002 that may have dealt with
your problem.

It was toward the end of the thread. Basically separating the
permissions tree of the EQ folder from the default and giving
administrator-like permissions to the folder and propagating that down
through subfolders and files. Take a look, it was fairly detailed and
might be useful.
