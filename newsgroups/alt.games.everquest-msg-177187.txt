In my wanderings from qeynos i've been looking around North Karana. I
read about the nice deal on killing wisps and giving the moonstones to
the gypsies for good experience and loot.

So i've been doing this and have made a hell of a lot more money than
I ever have before. Though it is a dangerous place, there's lots of
high level creatures wandering around that con red and ready to
attack.

Though they never have .... quite a few times i've been busy fighting
a wisp just to see a hill giant wander past me, or a griffon.... all
con red and "ready to attack", though not a single one of them has
ever even glanced my way.

I though "ready to attack" and them being above your level would make
them come after you if you got close enough ? One time a hill giant
walked past me, he wouldn't have been more than 20 feet from me but he
just kept on walking ?
