I know how well I can heal and how well I could heal before TR was
added. I knew which camps I could do solo heal work for in Velk's. I
also saw far too many morons who didn't even dare camp the back wall
without a cleric. And Sebilis? Spending 2 of my 3 allotted hours /lfg
is not for me.
I figured out that I could solo Chardok after grouping there at 54 and
55, but those were groups with people who were guildies at the time
and whom I haven't wanted to hang out with later due to circumstances.
