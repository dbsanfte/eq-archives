Role as is playing an immersive character who lives in Norrath, not
someone who is there ticket punching.

Don't understand that comment.

Right, the plot line there has no being on events in Freeport. The
Freeport,  Velious, Kunark, and Gunthak plotlines all sit undeveloped
and unmoving. They are abandoned and frozen in time.

Player PP has nothing to do with the world of Norrath. You miss my
point, the player PP should have nothing to do with the economic life
of the town. There still has to be farmers and the like who are not
adventuring, NPCs, and there is no plotline on how they react to the
stones.

Players spending plat in a town should be causing hyperinflation by
now. If you are the only showmaker in Freeport, you now compete with
all the shoe makers in Qeynos. Why would the Cabilis guards not come
streaming through the stone to Neriak, that are right close by? An
invasion would be simple.

There is no role-playing reason to not ruin faction to get what you
want.
