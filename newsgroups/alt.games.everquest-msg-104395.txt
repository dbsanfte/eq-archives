    Whatever is the path which optimizes reward and minimizes time spent,
I'll take it. I'm not into banging my head into the wall. That said, I will
consider intangibles, like learning the layout of a dungeon or how to pull
using proximity aggro, as rewards. I do also value new experiences, although
once I find one I tend to grind it into the ground.

    I used to be close to that with Delores. But now I raid, and have died
six times in one very bad night alone. You expect to die trying new things,
or even doing old things that are tough.

    It's that death is an unavoidable part of the endgame. People find that
out soon enough. If you want to XP grind in safe ways, go ahead - if you
already know how to play in all basic situations then all you need is to get
XP grinding out of the way anyways. But I don't think anyone who raids can
make the "I've only died a few times!" claim.
