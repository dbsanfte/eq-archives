I've just done a total sweep of the member list. The people you see are the 
only people left in this guild. Yes, we need to recruit to keep this puppy 
sailing. If you wish to join back up with GoH let me know. You can reach me 
serveral way the best being email which is: Ced@guardiansofhonor.com or by 
posting in our forums.

It wasn't easy to do but it had to be done. Remember we have an open door 
policy with this guild. If at anytime you wish to return you're free to. 
However, you cannot expect your rank to resemble what it did before you 
left. So, as I always say, HAIL TO ALL MEMBERS OF GUARDIANS OF HONOR!

An Announcement from Fluffy: I have decided after finsing no suitable guild 
for myself, I will be starting up a GoH Everquest 2 branch, I'm going to 
test the waters and see what I can rustle up. Hopefully I can be succesful 
like it looks like you guys are. So Again, HAIL TO ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE 
MEMBERS OF GUARDIANS OF HONOR!
