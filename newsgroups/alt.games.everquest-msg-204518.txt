You don't really "dye" anything. You tint the slot, with a color
overlay. This is the same way that SOE made rubicite and such, the
underlying silver armor texture has a red tint applied to it and the
under texture color still shows through.

So if you tint your chest slot some rgb value of blue, with a silver
breastplate texture under it, that tint will tint any texture under it
but THE ORIGINAL TEXTURE COLORS WILL SHOW THROUGH AND BE TINTED.
So if the original color is light silver the  blue color will be
brigher, if it is a darker texture darker.

So if you tint your chest slot then switch from a silver breastplate
texture item to a chainmail item, the tint color will appear darker
since the chainmail texture is darker.

So a light brown leather texture lends itself to being tinted green
more than it does tinted yellow. 

Picking a particular color value, then applying it to each slot does
not reall work for this reason, unless all your underlying textures
were the same. My druid is kind of a mess with leather and chain
textures of various types, so if I picked the same color value it
would look different on the chain and leather pieces. So I tinted one
piece then slid the sliders until the other pieces matched.
