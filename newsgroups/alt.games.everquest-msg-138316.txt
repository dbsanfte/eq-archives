> South Karana: I'm  too low

Depends on what you hunt there.  The Aviaks should be ok because they do not
aggro and they span several levels. You are also close to a zone if you get
into trouble.  Also, right near the entrance to Lake Rathe (from SK) three
gnolls spawn that I think were dark blue at around 24th level for my shaman.
You might need some help breaking the spawn, but I think this might be a
good place to solo.

What about druids? Anyone? I have a level 24 necro that I wanted to start
killing druids and Treants with.
