It's just a bit more subtle than that.  I believe, and intended to
imply, that if we become so disrespectful of foreign peoples that
we no longer attempt to explain and justify our actions to them it
will be inevitable that a degree of hostility certain to lead in turn
to war will follow as night follows day.  Not being actively psychic
I won't presume to claim to know who would start shooting the bug guns
first.
