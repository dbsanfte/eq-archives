But then again, there's more than one person working on quests.  There's the
fact that some NPCs use correct spelling & grammar, too, but that only
proves that quest programmer JobBob knows how to spell...it says nothing
about JimBob, the other quest programmer.

Unless Verant speaks up it's pretty academic, we're just debating for
debating's sake.  Hell, I agree that it's probably not an exploit in
Verant's opinion.
