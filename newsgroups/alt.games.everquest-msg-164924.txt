   Hey, I was trying to help!  At least the first thought that popped
into my head wasn't one of encouraging you to take a long, hot bath with
an electrical device!  And I never said you had to pretend you were a
full party or anything, so you wouldn't have to do different voices.  
   So give it some thought.
