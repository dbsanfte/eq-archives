This is unacceptable.  We're going to have to teach you how to behave 
properly when kiting.  First, practice picking up stuff that runs at 
different speeds.  Then find the nearest group recovering from a tough 
fight and run your ragged kite over them, getting them in trouble.  
Then, when they manage to recover from *that*, come back and start 
swearing at them and insisting that you had it under control and they 
KSd and you've already petitioned them and they better stop stealing 
your mobs because you've been in the game since beta and you know Brad 
personally and if they don't stop KSing you're going to call him over so 
he can beat them up and nerf all their spells.
