  Basically, like someone said you run like heck. Trick is to go through the
center of the opening (just to be safe). Run till you get to the hill that
divides the zone. Your safe there barring the Guards coming out because of
someone else.
  If you can get a bind in the Tunnel/hall that leads up to it. Beats
running back from Erudin if you die in there (and you will, unless your
really really careful).
  The loot is OK and neat looking but the best thing about it is that it
sells to NPC merchants for allot. Save for a few items you can easily make
about 30 or 40 plat in an hour if your good. I've made more but that is a
good starting point for reference purposes.
  WARNING: The Trains in the Warrens are murderous. I've been overwhelmed by
obscene amounts of Kobolds out of nowhere chasing some poor bastard. Make a
hotkey for the trains you'll make and pay attention to other shouts. Some
people sit in the entrance waiting for the trains so they can pick them off.
Also, the only exit is often highly populated and Its not uncommon to Zone
into a slew of Kobolds.  And if it weren't obvious.... The Kobolds con lower
than what they are.
