I was discussing this fact at lunch today with a friend.  I have not set
foot in Gunthak since I got my Blood of Nadox spell, however, I can't hardly
live without the extra bank slots or the in game maps that came with the
expansion.   I 2-box, and 1 of my accounts does not have LoY, and I can
really tell the difference when I happen to be only on that account and hit
the map key and nothing happens, or fill up my bank.  Of course, I haven't
missed it enough to enable it on both accounts yet, either :)
