 Err... no. Exactly the opposite... The EULA states that children under 18 MUST
use their parents account, it's actually right up there on top of that annoying
EULA screen in which we all have to click "ACCEPT" to play. I can tell you
really have been paying attention there....

 EVERQUEST(R) USER AGREEMENT AND SOFTWARE LICENSE

1. Accounts are available only to adults or, in their discretion, their minor
child.  If you are a minor, your parent(s) or guardian(s) must complete the
registration process, in which case they will take full responsibility for all
obligations under this Agreement. By clicking the "I Accept" button and
providing us with a credit card number, you represent that you are an adult and
are either accepting this Agreement on behalf of yourself or your child. You may
not transfer or share your Account with anyone, except that if you are a parent
or guardian, you may permit one child to use the Account instead of you (in
which case you may not use that Account). You are liable for all activities
conducted through the Account, and parents or guardians are liable for the
activities of their child. Corporations and other entities are not eligible to
procure Accounts.
