Sorry I meant Crafted, There is no Carved for the Claidhmore, think that is
only for the Brawl Stick. Anyway, it is 30/36 as I said.
The better one is the Exquisite Velium Claidhmore which is 32/36 but this is
far rarer and the price normally shows this (at least on Bristlebane)
Allakhazams shows the Tempered one as 32/35 but I am certain it is actually
32/40...becuase I had one.

Argent Protector is 42/49 +10AC. Much more damage in the hands of a 50+ (or
even 40+) but not so hot to a low 20's character.

CF
