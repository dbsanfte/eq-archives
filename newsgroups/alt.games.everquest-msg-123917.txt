They are, unfortunately, representative of the typical person
you'll find in this newsgroup and to a *slightly* lesser
extent, in EQ.

Just FYI -- I have an Athlon 1600+, GF3 Ti200, 1Gb RAM and
I run EQ with full details and view distance.  I do not,
however run the Luclin models because they increased the
zone times incredibly (why, I cannot fathom...) and I think
they generally are not that great.

Anyway, you should be fine with that system.

Mike
