There won't be. They've tried this before and due to the low uptake of 
broadband in Australia they run at a loss. A lot of the people who do 
sign up do it to sap all the bandwidth they can by downloading "Linux 
ISO's" *cough*warez*cough* in excess. So, what few customers the ISP's 
do have are sucking their network dry, and they're running at a loss.

This is even happening on 56k dialup modem accounts too.

I was extremely annoyed when the 3GB cap was first introduced, but these 
days I find I never go over the limit anyway, and this is with 3 people 
sharing the one account. The files library at games.telstra.net helps a 
lot too.

Still, if Optus cable is available to your residence get that instead. I 
wish I could.

Its annoying, but still worth it IMHO.

BTW, have you noticed this special offer?

I'm sure Bigpond love EQ, since Bigpond can charge for all the EQ 
traffic, including patches, as opposed to those annoying Quakers using 
the local server for free. ;)
