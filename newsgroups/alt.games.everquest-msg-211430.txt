Bah, you beat me to it, was gonna say the same. My level 56 monk got 
around 40-42 DPS, with the Crit AA at level 1 (can see gear on magelo), 
you should just owrk on getting level 60, youll get a new dmg table and 
triple attack then, a guild monk told me he had a VERY noticeable 
increase in DPS at level 60. Just go level, youll be rewarded at 60.
