Yes, that's the party line, we've heard it thousands of times, so what?
Human "cultural" smithing is just as open to a Necro or SK following
Bertox or Inny as it is to a Cleric or Paladin following Rodcet Nife
or Karana (Bertox's enemies) or either of the Marr twins (Inny's foes).
You're telling me that these vicious centuries-long blood feuds (don't
forget that Bertox "killed" Karana not all that long ago) are set aside
as utterly unimportant when it comes down to what truly matters:
excluding Half-Elves from performing (not using mind you, performing!)
Human cultural smithing?  That rationalization is just as pathetic as
the crap you hear from players whining about being suspended/banned for
"sploits".  If the stuff is so fucking secret and special why is it
that Half-Elves can make nothing but can wear damned near everything.
It's just a bullshit slap at Half-Elf tradeskillers, nothing else.
Tell my why it is that Half-Elves can wear Brellium, for instance.
