 Howling Stones. I don't go there anymore so I don't mind if it gets
crowded. :P

 The zone in and basement are good at 60. You'll have some light blues
but should average 75% dark blues. Mobs aren't social at 60 in those
areas. You can fear them off and wait for them to come back if you want.
I don't know if a pet would change things though. I'm guessing mobs
would aggro on a pet if you tried fear kiting down there. I don't
recommend fearing zone in mobs though. They path east and those stairs
are fake and you will pick up social aggro since the mobs there are
higher level.
