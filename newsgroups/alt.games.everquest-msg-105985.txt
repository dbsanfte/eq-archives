afaik, the size listed only factors into what kind of bags the
item will fit into, and has no bearing on class/race restrictions, as those
are handled by the Class and Race restriction fields.

your half elf druid cannot wear it because it does not say Half Elf under
races.
Likewise, vah shir, ogres, trolls can wear it, because they are listed under
Races.

the small refers to the bag it will fit in, in this case you can put the
cloak into
any bag with capacity: small or bigger.
