Good luck .. I camped him twice .. lost the items the first time ( quest was
broken ) then he didnt pop for 3 months before verant realized the mob was
broken ( which they nerfed his spawn ) .. then finally did 100 hours
straight before I got both items .. needless to say after being fried,
toasted and burned out , I quit for 4 months .. best of luck friend ,
