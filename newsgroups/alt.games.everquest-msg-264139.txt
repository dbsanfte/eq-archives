Unless you want to figure it out by yourself read on. I try to point out
the locations of the missing parts.
The only hard to find piece is the one in the sea imho. I literally
stumbled over the other two. So lets make this short. One piece is at
the roots of the chieftain tree house. This side of the tree isn't even
guarded. 

The second piece is a bit harder to explain. There are two ways to reach
the goblin encampment. (Actually there is a third one by swimming
through the lake and going up the stairs but I leave this out.) One way
goes over a bridge. And in this shallow creek there is the second part.
You might stumble over it when you flee from the goblins and jump down
into the lake.

That leaves the last part. It is buried in the sea. When you've talked
to the gnome just stand at the shore and face the open sea. There are a
few isles. Between the rightmost one and the adjoining one there you
should find the last part. It's a bit tricky to find the first time. But
afterwards it really is easy. There are aggro sharks around so either do
it in group or wait until lvl5.

I hope my directions do make sense. Good luck in finding the parts. ;)
