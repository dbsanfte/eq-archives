That's not a lot of memory. Memory is cheap these days, so get more. EQ
wants a lot of it anyway. Try http://www.crucial.com/ for good cheap
memory. I have 512 Mb in my machine and it's "ok". I put a gig of it in
my wife's new machine and it runs like wildfire.

Not all Motherboards and systems can handle that much, though, so check
and see how much yours can take first, and max it out.
