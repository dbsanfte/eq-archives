	Speaking from your extensive experience with the server?

	I've found that the people on Stormhammer are pretty much the same as the
people everywhere else in the game.

	FWIW, the Jaggedpine zone did go live on Stormhammer in this patch.  For
some reason the zone files were patched to all users; probably they forgot to
flag them as Legends-only.  (If you check the patcher, there is a checkbox to
select Legends files, just like optional and expansion files.)  I took a look
with my 24 Ranger and got killed by a 50something Gnoll that got pulled to the
zonein area and replicated itself a few times.  A few minutes later I received
an unsolicited CS res whilst running back from the Nexus.
