You will not evade me, "Jim Quinn" <dontexist@hotmail.com>:

You're being paranoid.

I can imagine you were getting on his nerves too.

You should.
If you die, it's usually taken as a sign that you can't hold a spawn.
A lot of people would take it and not let you have it back.

That's right, you weren't there. Why shouldn't he take it? For all he
knew, you'd just run out an errand...

I believe you're now stereotyped as a d00d n3cr0 with quite a few
people now, though.

It's also ruder to go off on them the way you did.

I wouldn't be too surprised if he warns his guild about you.

This other guy was waiting for you to get done, he gave you the camp
back once after being accused of making you go link dead, you
vanished. He had every right to assume you were done after all and had
just forgotten to tell him, and would probably not be favorably
disposed to the high level camping baby stuff and yelling at him.

Go kill treants instead, and learn to control your temper with camping
issues. You overreacted at both instances and chose the wrong way to
express your opinion.
