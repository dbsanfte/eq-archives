Existing shields would be more useful (even a wooden one) since
they could be used to Bash and/or Parry, something you couldn't
do without them.  And it's a reasonably certain guess that some
shields would get modifiers on them, both existing ones and new
drops, probably at all levels.

The hammer, though, is pretty stupid, unless they tune some of the
higher-end *common* drops to be better.  After all, what class
gets any summoned item that's better than a dropped item?

Personally that effect on my Pebble Crusher would make me happy,
other than the whole stupidity of expecting clerics to melee blues.
