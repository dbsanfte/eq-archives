This theme you are working on is quite the hoot.  You have leapt from
Phillip to Horselover to Likespotatos, which I know you feel is
sufficient, but to really complete the analogy you need to leap from
Likespotatos to an ancient and honorable name (like Phillip meaning
Horselover) and then show that such a name is not allowed.  If you can
provide such a name which equates to Likespotatos then you have
completed your work, otherwise you are just masturbating in a text
mode.  Still its fun to watch.  Does that make me a perv, or is it the
fact that I'm a perv that makes it fun to watch?
