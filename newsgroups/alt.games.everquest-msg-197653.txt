No, he's in a guild that is anti-fealty.  EQ is a game, not a war,
not a desperate struggle for personal survival where death and
enslavement are real, it's a game.  For that matter, do you take
that attitude IRL?  Do you spend all your free time tutoring
children who are falling behind in school?  Obviously not, you
play EQ.  And yet there are opportunities out there for you to
help real people through real trials in real life, fellow citizens
whose lives could be made better by you.  So where the hell is YOUR
loyalty you hypocritical asshole?
