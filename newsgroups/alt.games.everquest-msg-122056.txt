Then either:
1. There was a recent stealth nerf or bug coded in.
2. You were bugged.
3. You missed a message, client didn't pick it up due to lag, etc.
4. You were fighting some low level mob I never heard of that can see
through a feign.

I can assure you beyond any doubt, at least as of a couple months back,
I had my necro (couple levels higher than yours, but not much, so same
ballpark) successfully feigned with *two* dotted mobs in the area who
stayed away so long as I didn't stand up until the dots wore off.
