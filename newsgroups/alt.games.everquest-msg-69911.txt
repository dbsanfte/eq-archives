Have you tried standing right at the zone in and doing a /corpse?
Allegedly (and I haven't done this myself yet) as of a recent patch, any
corpse stuck in the wall will come to you at the zone line if you do the
/corpse command from there.

Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
That just gave me the most EVIL freaking idea. Let me know what you guys
think.

This weekend we had a small party doing some xp grinding in the Hole.
The entrance mobs down to the balcony were going down too fast, so we
decided to move down and take the courtyard. Went fine for a while, but
then we got the inevitable adds at one point, chanter went down, and we
lost the druid before an evac could be gotten off. TPW except we got the
cleric camped out in time.

I happen to have a level 1 CR rogue stationed there, so I logged him on,
got consent from everyone, and pulled all the corpses up to the ditch
just before the drop-off ledge. (As far back as they can be pulled.) I
noticed, that as I dropped them there, they were partly to mostly stuck
in the curving wall of the ditch at the top of that ramp, though still
visible enough for the cleric to rez them. So now this post has me
wondering... what if I had dragged them all to there, dumped them partly
in the wall, then we'd all just zoned in naked to the entry pool and did
a /corpse? Would they have come to the zone line where we could then
drag them up out of the wate to loot?

Anybody happen to have tried this yet?
