Would you mind restating it?  Since it's apparently one of the messages I
skipped, and the thread is now over 150 posts long.

Because, really, this is the interesting part of the thread, and the issue
keeps getting distracted by other petty bullshit.

Innocent until proven guilty means you assume he didn't do the act until you
can prove that he did.   It doesn't mean that you assume every side ruling
will go his way, the search will be declared illegal and the evidence thrown
out, so therefore you have to assume he's innocent despite the evidence in
hand.

I don't give a shit about the plat selling scum, but I think that the
position you're using to excuse the theft would set a very bad precedent.
It would be used as a basis for defense in any future case of virtual theft
in an online game.  If I, or anyone else who was not a plat selling scum was
hacked and stolen from, I would not want the person getting off on the basis
of "Sorry, not theft, SOE owns it" and all the other stupid arguments that
have been trotted out here.   And as emotionally satisfying as Sean's
"solution" of taking a baseball bat to the hackers head (and then hoping the
police can't find _you_) may sound, I'd very much prefer to have a legal
remedy available.

Personally, as I mentioned before, I think we should have a secondary
ownership interest in our accounts, and the virtual property contained
therein.  Such would protect the account owner by offering protection under
destruction of property and theft laws.   SOE would have to retain a primary
ownership interest, obviously, since we can't have a situation where the
game company becomes beholden to the players due to threat of lawsuit.
They must retain the control which would allow their business to function,
such as the ability to ban accounts, nerf formerly valuable items, and to
shut down a server (destroying all of the property), without giving basis to
possible lawsuits.   This would also allow Sony to decide if they were
granting players permission to resell their accounts or any part thereof, as
a policy decision.

Do I think we'll ever see such a solution?   Probably not.   It's quite a
bit more complicated than simply declaring one person or the other the sole
owner of the property, and I don't think your average judge on the bench
would understand the need for it enough that they would be willing to make
such a specialized distinction.  Unless for some reason they were intimately
familiar with the online gaming market.
