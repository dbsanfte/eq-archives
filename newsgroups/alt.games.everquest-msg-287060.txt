Its a dream come true.  Works on mobs, works on your own body.  On mobs 
its of limited use, since most mobs are still dropping a mix of good and 
junk items (all page/rune/word are now junk, for instance) but on your 
own body its fantastic.  It loads your stuff in roughly a second; not 
instantly but in the time it would have taken to click two or three 
items.  One caveat, wait a second before clicking the loot all button, 
as it takes a little while to load that much loot on your body when you 
open it; click it too soon and you'll end up leaving some of your bags.

If you do that, you can still loot again, of course, but its simpler to 
open, wait, loot all.

There's a confirm window when you loot all, so hopefully there won't be 
too many incedents of people loot/all-ing raid mobs with no trade items.

I don't know if there's an additional confirm if you try to loot a no 
trade item, or if the loot all dialog is the only one you get.

This is probably the intent, I just would prefer to see more 
differentiation between the classes; I think plate classes should be 
more able to take a beating than chain and so on down the line; these 
mobs -should- vaporize silk wearers.  Not Getting Hit should be their 
class byword.

I don't know about the underlying mitigation tables, but I did see my 
dodge and parry caps go up, so maybe they didn't monkey with the tables 
at all.  A mage friend reported that his displayed AC went up by 250 
points, which was just shy of a 25% improvement.

I'd have made it opt in instead of opt out; as you say, it turns out the 
  fix is messing people up, and only a minority of the people needed any 
fix at all, and there was already a working one in place that wasn't 
bugged.  They didn't make it available, they made it the default, 
putting a bandaid over a problem that for most people wasn't a problem.

I'd have offered it as an alternative bandaid instead.

Oh, and I'd have tested it to see if it was bugged before releasing it, 
but wait, this is SOE, thats against company policy.

There have been times... but my SK bought 10 coffins when he hit 60 a 
year ago, and two days ago when we went to Sky had to buy some more.  At 
that point, he had 5 coffins despite never having bought another.

Times are few and far between, these days.

The new spell recipe thing is confounding at the moment, but I'm 
guessing in the long run it will be an improvement, right now we're 
living thru a time when the new stuff hasn't been discovered and 
propagated to the online websites.

The 68 buff Rune of Decay is exactly the same as the 64 one, except that 
it lasts an hour and has a much shorter refresh time.  Previous buffs 
you pretty much had to dedicate a spell slot to in order to keep the pet 
hasted, this one you can swap in as needed; and odds are he'll die 
before refresh time anyway.

Without some vast improvement in pet survival vs AE and AE ramp (I don't 
ask him to be able to withstand melee damage) he's of marginal interest 
most of the time unless I'm soloing.  But I was annoyed that they 
applied some sort of improvement to necro pet haste and not to SK, which 
is essentially the same thing.  (If they did, after all, I haven't 
tested, perhaps they improved SK too but forgot to say so)

Yes, every 5 levels or so, lowbie SK get another HT AA.  The new HT is 
substantially bigger than the old one for most people; apparantly it 
works as if  you had the best focus item and were running Unholy Aura 
disc.  A level 52 friend reports a 5x improvement in his damage since he 
had neither; mine roughly doubled.  Its also unresistable now, reportedly.

Its still a sick joke.  Lets say it refreshes once per hour and does 6K 
damage.  Thats 100 damage per minute, 10 Damage per tic, 1 DPS, if you 
use it each and every time as soon as it pops up.

Best news is they took UA off of it, and promise sometime to give us a 
disc to replace UA, which was always a groaner.

They did not move or clone the NPC to POK.  For the non combine people, 
I thought it might be a trick to force them to buy anniversary edition 
or the new expansion (which comes with all previous expansions in the 
bundle.)  For Combine people I thought it might be deliberate, keeping 
us a little more primative than the latest and greatest, as it were. 
But one of the Dev's reportedly said he would put a guy in POK for us, 
if so, then it was an oversight and not a plan after all.

Yeah I'd think you would want to do that.  Plus, this way you could have 
one upgraded bracer and one normal one, one upgraded earring and one 
normal one.  Or maybe you couldn't, I haven't looked too closely into it 
since we can't do the upgrade on Combine anyway.

Its sure better than carrying around a partial set of gears taking up 
inventory space, though.
