No no no. My *sneak* won't work often.  But around the time I dinged 6 it 
started working about 1 out of every 10 attempts, so I was selling like 
normal last night.

I practice it as I run.  Got it and hide doubled up with sense heading.  
I hit 'hide' when I'm sitting (yes I know skill ain't going up yet but SH 
skill is and it gets me used to practicing it for when it WILL go up) and 
'sneak' when I'm hunting.

Oh really?  That makes up for the fact that I can't carry anymore than my  
poor wussy monk can carry? ;)  Hmmm time to start up the old trade skills 
again...
