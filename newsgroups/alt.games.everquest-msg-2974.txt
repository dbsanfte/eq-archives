I'm pretty sure that Verant isn't lazy and type "u" for "you."  Well, it
does sound like something a critter no smarter than an ogre would say, so I
could be wrong.

Turning off the nodrop message is certainly an option but the first time you
loot something while grouped that was a good nodrop item that someone else
wanted you're going to be in deep shit.
