They actually did make Dalnir a hotzone for a while.

The problem with your suggestion that deserted zones mean there's
always someplace to explore and hunt, is that that only works for
people who have a group (or can solo).  The advantage of the old
overcrowded zones was that you could go there and be sure there'd
be other players available to form groups with.  There might not
be groups with open spots, or enough mobs to go around, but there'd
be players.  Now, if I want to go explore Dalnir, I'd better have
some friends to bring, or be high enough level that I can solo it,
which tends to make it less exciting.

But I think that's sort of why they added hotzones, and why Dalnir
isn't one any more.  They realised they don't have enough players
at all levels to keep all the zones populated, so they use hotzones
as a way of drawing players in various level ranges.  Back when
Dalnir was a hotzone, you COULD actually go there and have a good
chance of finding a pickup group.  Now it's deserted again, but
there's someplace new for players to find pickup groups at that
level.  By shifting the hotzones around they can give players new
places to explore, and take advantage of all that content you were
writing about.

And meanwhile, of course, those players lucky enough to HAVE a
regular group, can go off and explore the world in whatever order
and at whatever rate suits them.
