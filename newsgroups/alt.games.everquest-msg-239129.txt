Ok I might be mixed up here on my terms so bear with me and you'll get
the jist.
I'm now a magician in my 50's dinging and unding from 51 to 52
depending on the weather.

I decided yesterday to finally take the PoT portal from PoK.
PoT is a Beautiful zone, and looks like nice place to fish, but I was
here to explore.

I found each and every portal to the "Higher Planes" but everyone I
tried to enter claimed I wasn't ready yet.

I have a buddy in my guild who is now 56 or 57 and plays in PoN all
the time, he told me that he was able to enter PoN at lvl 50-51 If he
recalled correctly but he wasn't quite sure anymore because it's been
awhile.

I went to Allakhazhams and found out the "Planar Progression" is the
one quest he is so incredibly vague on that I really can't follow it.

So why can't I enter any of the planes other than PoT and PoK?

What is going on here?

Do I need to do a quest?  If so who do I talk to, or what do I need to
do?
Do I need to kill a mob in PoT that drops a key or something? (Guildy
said he never had to kill anything or do a quest that he was aware of
but he did do alot of the PoK quests for fun, and he just walked right
on into PoN)
Do I just need to wait to be a higher level?  Or is it something else
I am missing here?
