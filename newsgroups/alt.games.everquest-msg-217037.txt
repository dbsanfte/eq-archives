It says something for how balanced LDoN is that there's so many
different ways to pull, often depending on group makup. My groups
almost always have a cleric and about the only time we pacify is
around the boss mob for assassinate missions. We've done the pacify
thing and it worked (albeit a bit slower but maybe it's just a matter
of practice). In the end though, it just isn't as much fun for me
compared to the chaos of dealing with 3-4 mob pulls.   <g> 

Group makeup probably has a lot to do with that, I tend to always have
a cleric and usually a druid along (a matter of what friends are
online) which means there's an excess of healing if you need it. That
also means there's only 3 slots left over for tank and pure DPS
classes which makes it hard to fit in a chanter. 

I am starting to gain a healthy respect for the good druids in LDoN,
their ability to switch between decent DPS, crowd control and healing
at a moment's notice is nice. Plus, tracking is a nice perk to have
when checking for named mobs at the end of the adventure.

I've sold out since LDoN came out, I'm actually buying KEI now!
