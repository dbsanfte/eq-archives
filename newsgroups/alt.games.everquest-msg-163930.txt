Well, there is a trick I found out. It workes. Reason I had to do it this
way is because in Europe PoP is ^$$%&*((&^!! stil not on sale. A friend of
mine in the US bought PoP for me and e-mailed me the product  key. Shipping
was too much of a fuss.

Required:
- a valid, non used code.
- some time.

First copy a file called LPATCH.EXE to PPATCH.EXE in your EQ-drectory . Now
the installer thinks you have PoP installed. If you trie to patch, the
patcher will notice you want to patch to much files. It will log stose in
Eqmissingfiles.txt or something. There you see which files you are missing
(about 150). Those can be downloaded directly from the patch-server. They
all have the extention.gz

Example:
http://patch.everquest.com:7000/patch/everquest/planesofpower/codecay.mp3.gz

Download all the files in a separate directory and unzip them in your
EQ-directory. Finished!!

I myself downloaded it with DaP and un-gz it all with WinRar. Both programs
used so I didn't had to point each file individually.

As a reminder, of course you have to have somebody to actually buy a copy of
PoP for you, so he or she can give you a working (non-used) code. But you
already know that.

Good luck, Harry
