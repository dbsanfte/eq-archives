Maybe this is their first character to make it that far?  My highest is 51
and I still have to ask questions.  There are many aspects of this game that
make it fairly complex, such as faction, spell stacking, etc. and no-one
will ever know everything.

Plus how could we ever stay on top of things like patch messages if they
weren't posted here 7 or 8 times every patch day?
