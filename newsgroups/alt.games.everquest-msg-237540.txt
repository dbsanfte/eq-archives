Nope.

Copyrights on things like Win2003 get renewed every year.  (EQ, put
out in '99, still has a current copyright ((C) 1999-2004, or however
they write it).  They would only stop renewing when they felt that the
payoff (new purchases) no longer balance the effort of getting the
copyright renewed.  Nobody could simply "wait out the 5 years" because
it's going to be renewed year to year until the company's tired of
supporting it.  And then people will *still* have to wait the 5 years.

So, using Win98 for example, it just stopped being supported, what,
last year?  It wouldn't go PD until 2008, but had steady sales *and
profits* all the way from '97 to last year, and they could still sell
off copies for the next 5 years.
