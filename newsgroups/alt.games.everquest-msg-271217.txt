I've seen almost no publications in scientific or technical journals or 
conference proceedings from Apple.  There's plenty from Microsoft.  Some 
of the top people in various areas of mathematics and computer science 
are at MS Research.  Who is at Apple Research?  Answer: no one--they 
were all laid off many many years ago.  What Apple has now is simply 
solid engineering combined with good industrial design and style.  But 
innovative, at least in the sense of actually advancing human knowledge 
with new ideas?  Nope.

Sounds like AAC/Fairplay.  Let's compare: WMA is compatible with almost 
every portable player except iPod.  AAC/Fairplay is compatible with just 
iPod.

Too bad music from the iTunes Music Store won't play on Linux, unless 
you track down a hack to get past Apple's proprietary copy protection.
