Planes suck at the level I was posting at.  Level 50 people don't kill 
level 60 stuff like you are talking about fast enough to get anywhere at 
all.  This isn't my first character in the planes, I have a 57 bard, a 
52 shaman, and a 65 cleric that all did substantial POP work.

You are correct, PoD courtyard (and castle, which you don't mention) is 
good exp, PON over the river or into the caves is good, as is just about 
anything tier two.

I don't think of normal POI crawling as good exp, though, Factory is, 
and I don't know the spot you are talking about thru a door... but 
regular POI mobs I've done many times with many charaters and many 
different groups, and have always found them dissapointing, far more so 
since the POP exp nerf (yes I know, they called it a solo nerf... but it 
was a group boost and POP nerf combined, the net effect of which is that 
while POP full group exp got a small boost, outside POP full group exp 
got a Big boost)

Pre Pop nerf, doing POD normal mobs was pretty decent solo, but with the 
drammatic reduction in exp, I've found pretty much any "normal" tier one 
mobs to be worse exp over time than working elsewhere where mobs hit 
less hard and have fewer hp, particularly without using charm as a tool.

LDoN exp, in contrast, was fabulous up till around 55, and scaled as I 
leveled; I was always grouped with people around my level (as LDoN 
forces that) and yet I'd get exp without having to hunt for new "sweet 
spots" and worry over whether they are contested.  At 55 I hit a wall, 
but at this level its quite possible to get in groups around my level 
that can kill mobs high enough to get the "near your level" bonus, which 
means a double whammy in terms of the POP to LDoN comparison; suddenly 
instead of LDoN being 5 times the exp per hour that POP is, the 
situation has reversed.

If your kills per hour (on mobs of a given level) are the same in POP as 
somewhere else, then your exp per hour is going to be much better, as 
POP has a 1.19 ZEM, compared to most outdoor zones with .75 ZEM, or most 
indoor zones with .85 or so ZEM, around half as much per kill.  Trouble 
is, at low levels, getting that "same number of kills per hour" thing 
going on.
