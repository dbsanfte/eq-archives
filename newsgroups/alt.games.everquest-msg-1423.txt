Another problem, you also have to contend with rolling on items... so when
something good DOES drop you only have a 1/6 chance of getting it.  I
haven't won a roll on one piece of gear since I was level 30 in Cazic Thule
when I rolled to win my Ravenscale Coif.  I'm now almost level 50 and have
lost on at least 20 high-priced drops.  

These days, anything you are able to solo hardly ever drops anything that
someone is willing to pay reasonable money for.
