Invis or camo is the only way; the Erudite guards HATE trolls and ogres.
Even getting through Paineel will be pretty difficult.

EASY WAY: Scrape together the cash and find a wizard or druid to port you
all to Toxxulia (on Xev, going rate is about 10pp each.) From the druid
ring, Kerra Isle is north west (head west to the beach, then north to the
docks. You will have to swim west.) The entrance to Paineel is in the
center of the south wall; head south then move along the wall to axis 0.
Look for a covered portico with no guards (the one with guards is the
entrance to Erudin.)
