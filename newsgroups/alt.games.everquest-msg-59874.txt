It's a bug that happened to me this weekend and happened to one of my party 
members twice recently.  If you camp and log back in, it goes to where it 
belongs ( it did for me ).

Before I dinged, my party member told me about the bug and that he had it 
happen severel days before that, and he dinged twice since then, both times 
getting thrown to the desktop right after the ding.  That's why I camped to 
fix mine, I didn't want to chance getting tossed out of the game in the 
middle of a pull.
