Which is why the price varies so wildly,  Once you have the one you
need, you can't get another till it's  used up, at which point, you want
another, ASAP.  

My suggestion, would be to pick an asking price, make it solid, or pick
a higher one, and have a negotiate bottom limit.  Auction periodically,
someone will want it,  I wouldn't suggest hanging out in EC, unless you
have plenty of time to burn.
