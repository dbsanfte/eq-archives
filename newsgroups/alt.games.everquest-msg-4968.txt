Indeed I have done so, even though its half the spell slots... still,
when it absolutely positively has to be shut down completely, having
that 4th stun up to fill in a resist or fizzle slot is mighty handy.  Too,
that fourth one is what, a 200 pointer?  The DD actually starts
to be appreciable when you consider that your principle chain
stun targets tend to be casters.

At 24th, I"m afraid he can't even load 3... so choosing which 2
of the three, or four, (or 3 of four) to load isn't really an issue yet.

For that matter my new cleric is only 27... will be another week
or two before I hit 34 and can worry about it!
