I think it rocks. Not just for raids (and man, this will hopefully help
people like the ones we have in our guild who can never get chat
channels to work) but for certain smaller instances. 

For example, when we are camping King or Juggs in Seb, we *usually* have
two groups there. And one invariably get's no xp, etc.  The same for
faction raids in the areana.  We can hold a side of the arena with six
people, but we often have a "few extra" there fixing their faction.
There are more examples.

The faction thing will be good for most people. Of course, for people
like me, it sucks. ;-p

Example: We cleared Hate last night. It took six hours. The silly fools
let *me* make the groups. MUA HA HA!

Just kidding. But the way it worked out, I was the only wizard there and
the only rogue was in my group. We got the xp on probably  75% of the
kills. My wife was in the group also and reported getting over 2 blue of
xp in level 55 just on the raid.

The raid systems changes are very good.
