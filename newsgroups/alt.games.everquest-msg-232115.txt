Im not sure of the level of your existing equipment - but here are
some real easy ones you can solo:

Testament of Vanear - East quest that yields a +10wis +10 mana (with a
focus effect that will probably be useless at your level)

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=144

Or the Paw of Oppolla (AC: +9 Sta: +5 Cha: -5 Wis: +9 Agi: +9 Disease
Resist: -5 Mana: +5)

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=386

Theres a series of quests that ends with an item with a clicky root
(usefull actually)

Warden Symbol of Tunare (assuming you are a tunare worshipper) AC: +7
Cha: +2 Wis: +3 Mana: +15  Effect: Grasping Roots
Classes: Cleric Druid Beastlord  (Neck slot)

Its the third in a series of quests

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1254


If you are looking for harder quests here are a few (you will probably
need help with these):
Cloak of the Wise (back slot)
AC: +7 Sta: +7 Cha: +7 Wis: +7 Int: +7 HP: +45 Mana: +45

Parts drop in most Tier 1 PoP zones - although I know for a fact all
the pieces can be found in Plane of Nightmares

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2222



Shield of Bane Warding
AC: +25 Cha: +8 Wis: +20 Magic Resist: +12 

You could probably solo most of it - but the final battle you will
need help with.
