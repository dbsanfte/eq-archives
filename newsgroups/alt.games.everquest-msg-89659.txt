Well, first things first, you have to know enough about their class to
judge.  If you're new to the game and a meleer, there's no way in hell you'd
know if most enchanters, wizards, clerics, necros, mages, etc are pulling
their weight.

What's your background?  How long have you been playing, and what classes
are your level 10+ characters?  What class was the lazy person?

But in answer to your question, if you have experience playing their class
and you know without a shadow of a doubt that they aren't pulling their
weight, don't group with them.
