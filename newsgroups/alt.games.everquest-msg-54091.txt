God yeah, that would be cake for you. Those mobs are low. My 52 druid
was there a while back and though it did not get into trouble and the
imp guy was already up there so I got that sac dagger, nothing that
hard is around there and it would be a ton easier for you with a pet.
Its more or less the initial very low trash, then the graveyard. You
could even invis until the graveyard and casually make a pet behind
that building where the solusek row invis guy is, then start the beat
down from there.
