Genesis 9: 7 - 17

7) And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the =
earth, and multiply therein.=20

8) And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

9) And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed =
after you;

10) And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the =
cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out =
of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

11) And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh =
be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any =
more be a flood to destroy the earth.

12) And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between =
me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual =
generations:

13) I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a =
covenant between me and the earth.

14) And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that =
the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

15) And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and =
every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become =
a flood to destroy all flesh.=20

16) And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I =
may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living =
creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

17) And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I =
have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.

I don't expect to see a rainbow in this area for quite some time,=20

any culture that promotes men socially who are indoctrinated into a life =
of meaningless repetitive labor without due reward deserves to be =
punished

Any culture that promotes women socially that put radioactive chemicals =
in their breasts, which are supposed to be the glands used to feed =
babies, and not possess the wisdom to know that is what causes autism, =
deserves to destroyed

The day of the Lord is upon us!!! BE VIGILANT!!!
