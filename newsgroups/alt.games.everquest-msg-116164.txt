There was a pen and paper RP game on the market called "Toon" (perhaps
it's still out there?).  In this game characters (referred to as toons,
incredibly enough) could not be killed and thereby removed from play as
in your typical RP game.  Rather characters could instead be made to
"fall down" for a while, after which your avatar would get up and
continue play (sound familiar?).  I find toon to be a wonderfully apt
descriptive term for our unkillable EQ characters.

Kaev
who dislikes:  plz, hun, bro, pally, lammie, & quite a few other bits of
common EQ slang at least as much as you others dislike "toon".  OTOH, I
don't mind "prolly" in the least, since it is after all a word (common
usage in a living language trumps any attempt to claim otherwise).
