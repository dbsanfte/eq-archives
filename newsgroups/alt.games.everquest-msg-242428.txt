Hehe!

Since DX9 has arrived.

My Ogre has bounced off open doors, rocks and trees. That is when he is 
not climbing the door and putting his head through the roof while he was 
trying to walk through said door.

While my Halfling has played ping pong with the PoK stones and bounced 
off the hills in Steamfont.
Also  zoned into an AFK character in PoK and got stuck. Followed the 
/ooc advice of duck and jab finally got me free!

Finally my Dark Elf was rather surprised at being rebuffed by the 
vendors in PoK some of whom sent him flying backwards, in one case off 
the platform for 8 points damage. All I said was "do you want to buy"
