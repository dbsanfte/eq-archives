Pros: right-clicking would list the items you have in the bank.
Cons: It would occupy an inventory slot

It's got a little easier now that the alt key shows up labels - open a
container in your bank vault, move the cursor over it and hold down alt
- you now have nice list of everything in that container. OK, you have
to do it 8 times, but its better than it used to be (no labels, no
moving stuff around until you'd swapped the pack out into your general
inventory etc).

And if that's not good enough, well, you could always write it down in a
notebook next to your computer :)
