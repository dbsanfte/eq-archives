Nope... 2 weeks ago...  My company's block was without power from 6am to
8am...  No mention of it in the news.  Reason:  Pre-existing warning to
people in that area of a power outage for 2 hours.  Unless it was a major
outage, like a good several blocks and for more than a couple of hours...
It will be in the news, but usually in the evening or late evening news.
