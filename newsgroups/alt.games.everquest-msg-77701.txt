Repeat:  UMBRA HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VIDEO CARD.

There's no such thing as an Umbra-enabled video card, or
a video card "without Umbra".

Umbra is a software algorithm which Verant bought and
added to their game engine.  Period.

The "UseUmbra=" line in the eqclint.ini file simply
tells the game engine whether or not to apply the Umbra
polygon-culling algorithm (*in software*) to the
zone data before passing it to the video card for rendering.
