Well to be honest no trade skill is really paying. Of course you can make
some money - once your tailoring and jewelry are at 220+ or soemthing.
The gems and metals to get just to 50 or so on jewellry will cost 
you hundreds if not thousands of pp.

Your characters (18 and 26 in level) are prolly not even close to the money
you need to do jewelcraft, especially with your probably low skill (you
didn't mention the chanters level). Get off the idea that tradeskills
are a way to make some easy newbie money, just go hunt things. Money
starts at about level 20, gets a bit speedier at 40 and the heaps come 
later through finding good items.

The easiest you can do is sit on the bum in EC and do the buy low -
sell high game for a few weeks.
