    I think my guild has. We've had episodes where half of the zone will
suddenly come plowing into us in CoD while we do an event there. And I'd be
using Pacification before the raid when we're doing XP.

    I think they mean a charmed mob was able to attack mezzed mobs. You can
imagine the problems this could cause an enchanter.

    Lots more. Before, at level 3, it was a 650 point rune (this is an AA
ability, not a spell). Now, at level 3, it's 1500. Forget what the earlier
levels used to be, but now they're 500/1000. Awesome upgrade.

    It changes a lot. ;-)

> What alternate methods?

    They're talking quests versus raids. Every plane is supposed to have two
ways to reach it: a raid (eg. "Kill Aerin'Dar to gain access to Halls of
Honor"), and a single-group method (eg. "go all around these tier one
planes, collecting these rarish-drop items, then hand them once combined to
these rarish-pop NPCs to gain access to the Halls of Honor"). Some of the
single-group methods are just being discovered now.

    Trials is the single-group method. Nobody has yet found the raid method
of getting the PoV/PoS flags.
