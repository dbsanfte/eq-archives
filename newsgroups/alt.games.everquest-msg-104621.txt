> Is there any "all-over" armour that would be worth questing for??

You could go for cultural armor. This requires a high smithing skill
so it'll take you a long time and loads of plat, but you can do it at
lvl 35. Still very decent gear and good looking.

Thurgadin armour requires you to hunt in Kael, but doing Kael at lvl
35 is optimistic ;). Never seen this, don't know the looks.

Wait untill you reach lvl 46 and join every Fear raid possible and get
a nice pale blue set of Valorium. The slightly better Righteous pieces
drop on Hate but only on 2nd floor and few random raid head there.

Also you can buy Deepwater stuff (DW drop in Sebilis and Karnors ie.
way out of reach for a lvl 36). Helmet, Gauntlets, Boots and Arms are
not that expensive. Legging, BP and Bracers are hard to find and often
very pricey. AC is great, other stats are very limited, and you'll not
benefit from right-click effect untill after lvl 45. Great looking.
Expensive for a lvl 35 but an investment.
