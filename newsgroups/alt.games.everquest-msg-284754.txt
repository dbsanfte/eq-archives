I just slaughtered in the Warrens(especially the named MOBS).  I got to
the point where I was no longer KOS to the main Paineel factions (con
the skel guards in the newbie yard) but tired of killing greenies and
couldn't get the key to paineel yet from the guard.  I didn't bother
with the tooth hand in quest since if you do it for Paineel then you
hurt Erudin faction.

A friend made a throw away paineel erudite, let me into the city and I
bought from the vendor without worry of being jumped.  I just gated out
from there.

It didn't take too long to faction beyond KoS...I just spend way more
time because I did want to be able to get into Paineel on my own...but
questing and wanting to kill in the Hole urged me to take a shortcut.
