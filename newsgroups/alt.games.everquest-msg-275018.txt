Ok. But your criticism fails on both points: First they -are- charging 
us a monthly fee so they have a revenue model to bill us for gradual 
content updates. (And it would be good for the long term survival of the 
game to do so.)

And 2nd its ridiculous to criticize the idea of zone revamps just 
because sony has done a lousy job of it. There is *no* reason whatsoever 
that a zone revamp can't be as good as a new expansion zone. (And don't 
bother arguing that if the zone revamps were so good nobody would buy 
expansions because 1) that isn't true, and 2) there are trivial ways of 
tying the zone revamps to new content so that you need the latest 
expansion anyway to really benefit from them. (And we all know sony 
isn't above doing that.)
