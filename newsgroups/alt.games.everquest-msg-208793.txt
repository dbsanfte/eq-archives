I know casting my JBB at Tier 2 mobs is but a nuisance to them,
however I've seen in some posts that we can get 500+ damage out of
them if we train AA crit and that's 100% of the time.  Is this true?

How many AA's for crit?  I would think this a nice thing for us, after
investing much time or PP in getting this item initially.

On those same posts, some have argued the item damage should not
increase, since it is an item and not a spell.  I say our mastery of
the item can very well account for increased damage, the same as a
warrior gets using his sword as he increases in proficiency of that
item.

So... JBB 500+ damage 100% of the time?  I'm running home immediately
if this is true! :)
