 *blink*??  What is your reference?  To my understanding, and I *could* be
completely wrong, the word "Yahweh" came out of an attempt to pronounce a
word that was not designed to -be- pronounced...  composed of the Hebrew
letters Yud Heh Vahv Heh...  When those letters are seen, people say
"Adonai", instead...  Yahweh doesn't -mean- anything, let alone
'Eternal'.... It's just a derivation of the name for the Judeo-Christian
deity.  Now, the word Leolahm means Eternal, or Forever...
