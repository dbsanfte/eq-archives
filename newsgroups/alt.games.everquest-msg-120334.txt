The guard fun tactic is fraught with peril as well. Total Death is also known as

Wipe; when not just one person in your group dies, but everyone does.   In
a normal camp, you occaisionally lose someone.  In a AOE group, if any
one element fails, you usually lose everyone very quickly... while a failure
to keep Mez on properly in a regular camp means two or three mobs, a
failure in mezing 30+ mobs results in ten or more out of control.  Chanters
die -extremely- rapidly and shortly after that so do everyone else.

There is an interval of relative safety -from the guard-   However the mob you
brought over to fight can easily break away from the guard to pursue you, if you

don't exercise some care in controlling the fight.  Too, the guard (like a mob
that broke charm) is coming right for you if your root fails or breaks, as soon
as you aggro him he no longer gives a fig for the fleeing target you brought
him.  And talk about bringing buddies, if its real "gaurds" you are using they
tend to have some of the highest Frenzy factors.

OK, so you only object to my plan when its real guards, not the more general
tactic of deliberately using mob mutual hatred against them.

The roaming guards?  Any time I've ever relied on guards it was stationary
ones in my newbie zones.  The roamers were a hazard, as they could never
be relied on when I needed them, but -could- be counted on to show up
out of nowhere to KS me, and no petition to Verant was ever going to stop
them.  Particularly obnoxious are the guards in Qeynos Hills and in...
Nektulous.

Show of hands, everyone still slogging thru this thread, how many people
think lighties aren't supposed to kill roaming DE guards, and for that matter
that Evils arent' supposed to kill the roaming QH guards?

As I say, I've never seen them as anything but a hazard to be avoided when
on their "side" and as my natural enemies when playing a race aligned against
them.  Certain guards should be left alone out of respect for newbies needing
protection (heck, I won't even touch the tollbooth guards in WC and killing them

is a time honored tradition for most evils) but to me roamers are not only fair
game, but a badge of honor and a source of pride.

Your final sentence doesn't seem to derive from the rest of the paragraph.
The tactic that I describe is not usuable only on nominal "guards;" as I've
said many times, I used the term too losely as shorthand for "any mob that
doesn't hate me and does hate my victim..." although the tactic can also
be used on mobs that -do- hate me but don't aggro out to atone range.  At
the same time, its -not- just my cleric that preys upon nominal guards... and
frankly this sort of guard use is far less damaging to the guard population
than the normal guard slaughter.  Root and Atone is the "catch and release"
plan of guard usage!

Women should stay at home, cook,  clean, and occaisionally have babies.
After all, they have the tools necessary to do so.  Ignore the fact that they
also have the tools to do almost every other job, and the brains and varying
personalities to make some of them want to do other things.

Clerics should get groups, buff, med, heal, med, heal, med and occaisionally
rez someone.  For sixty levels.  After all, they have the tools necessary to do
so.  Ignore the fact that they also have the tools to do almost every other job,

and the brains and varying personalities to make some of them want to do
other things.

Do you play a cleric?   While there are some players for whom a steady diet
of nothing but healing works, more often you'll see clerics abandoned as the
boredom of the SIT plan sets in, and then occaisionally you'll see people
like me for whom the widely varied tactical options available to the class
are -all- to be used, and for whom the class is a constant source of unexpected
fun.  "What is this spell usuable for" is one of the principle tennants of my
approach to EQ, as is "how can I do -that- with my cleric?"
