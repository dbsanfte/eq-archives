Although I think it would be a great idea, could you imagine the effect on
table top gaming :ï¿½)
No seriously, if you had the ability to run a server for friends create new
content (to a degree) and quests wouldn't you?
Using the original graphic engine (the one that ran well after DX8.1 but
before Luclin) I would imagine plenty of modellers and skinners would be
able to create new looks and creatures. Writing in new, NPC driven, quests
would be more difficult, I would think.
It won't happen though, even after Verant does shuts down the last EQ server
there would be too much oppotunity for someone else to make money on it,
charging people to log in.

Still, nice thought.
