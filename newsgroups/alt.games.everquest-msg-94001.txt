> West wing and the entry area between the wings is on CoV faction.

West wing is where armour drops that is quested in kael (giant allied
people)

> East wing is factionless and KoS to all

East - HoT - is armour pieces that you quest in skyshrine

> North wing is on some faction that is KoS to all but also lowers CoV when

CoV and GoV

As far as I can see, GoV is a 1 way faction that you can't raise.. nor does
it matter since you start kos anyway
