Well in terms of advancement, I don't just mean gear, but AA's too.  If you
are going to spend 100k pp, you can exp for Spell casting subtlety too.

I know this doesnt always strictly apply for twinks, but for a mage main
with a high quality of gear/mana, they would likely be with a similar
equipped tank (i.e better agro, allowing more dps from the mage without
drawing agro).

I don't know how my mages gear compares to you (needs a little rethinking
now too, since he got the mana pres 4 neck, has it on his (crappy starts)
arms.. and has a banked ft 3 neck

http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=230325

But hes over 4k mana/hp also with buffs... and when I exp with him, I sure
spend a lot of time mod-rodding, and spam-clicking his mana robe, to have
enough mana for the kind of exp rate for whats normal to him.  Im sure the
group makeup plays a bigger part for the huge differences between me and you
(directly), but it still proves the point, mages benefit from more and
better gear

Well i partly agree here, in the same way any naked caster could kill a
mob... but a naked melee won't be killing anything naked.

It depends whats acceptable to you though, im not the kindof person who can
play a character thats OOM after 2 nukes :)

You may well recall when I picked my mage back up from the shelf, and posted
his magelo here.. his gear was pretty poor, before that it was even poorer
(raw silk at 53 rar!).. compared to his magelo now, his gear has came along
bounds and leaps.  Each major stage of upgrade has also made very noticable
difference to his ability to exp, id even go as far as saying the kill rate
is twice as fast nowadays, than before i made effort to upgrade him.

So whilst gear isn't required to [cast a nuke], imo its still damned well
required for the class to be a viable source of DPS

Price is server specific of course.. if you played on my server, you'd see
all class spells for 1-5k, regardless of class

You could say mez is very situational, which of course is true, but you
can't say its useless.  In the places it can be used, its amazingly
powerful.  Black steel - you had a hardon for this nuke before the beast
exists, another not useless spell.  Blade of the kedge is a good pet
enhancement. Child of Ro is allegadly decent if used with suspend minion (to
get an insta-fm pet).. never decent for me tho heh.  Sinia is insanely
useful in exp and raids, Jewelry bag is good for lazy peeps like me (and
means no quest, to get the dot bracer!).
Destroy summoned.. well the whole line is a joke really :)  Girdle of
magi'kot, again another sweet pet weapon. Maelstrom of thunder finds a lot
of use on my mage.. if all waves hit, its a great nuke.

Whilst its very situational, its retardedly powerful (read: overpowered) in
places it can be used.
I know you don't rate Rathe's son very highly, and if it costs 20-30k then
maybe that goes some way to explain why.. it didn't cost me anything though,
and its found its way into my memmed spell slot (on occasion).. I've grouped
with guild mages who use it on occasion too.. so I wouldn't really call it a
waste of time

Lol 120k and 300k.. the only real point i will concede here is, its easier
to buy uber melee gear than uber caster gear.. and by uber I mean with real
useful foci, whilst regaining solid stats.. if a pet focus item was for sale
for 150k, say something on a par with Vexthal, it would be different.

As it stands though, you can get droppable melee weapons in easy farmable
places, from easy mobs, that are as good as the toughest mobs in SSRA, and
casters can't.

Depends if you think flowing thought is work sacrificing your HP, Mana and
other stats for.  Whilst ft2 20-40hp/mana items won't break the bank.. if
rather not lose 80 hp and mana per item, to gain a few flowing thought.  FT
items with uber stats is where its at! (ldon augs make a nice difference
here)

5-6k hp could mean a big difference, yes.  Afterall, you arent TANKING the
mobs.. you just need to survive a blow or 2 after drawing agro (and
hopefully your tank doesn't take all day in getting it back)

Comparing hp to mana, melees and hybrids to casters is apples and oranges,
but they still have uses

On tight fights, where everybody has been smacked, half the group is dead,
which albeit dont happen often (or [shouldnt] at least!), your surviving
being 1 rounded, your better mana pool to burn a mob beyond normal speeds
etc could be the only difference between a semi and full wipe.

Not sure if i still have it, I will dig around when I have some free time..
but picture the following.  AoW raid, the entire raid has died minus 1
person. After a summon and smack, the last remaining caster manages to a)
live through the round of melee and b)channel their nuke c) Kill AoW and
prevent a blown spawn/lost loot.

Not the norm, but it happens! :)

Raid more, I'd agree with. But thats because caster gear of the same quality
as melee just isn't available to be farmed, or even looted yourself for the
most part, outside of raids

So whilst comparing hybrids and pure casters, (or slow casters versus
non-slowing casters) is pretty meaningless in the very first place.. I do
think the point shows any character, including a magician, will show
improvement with gear upgrades.  Maybe not noticable individually, but then
do you think any one piece of armour is keeping your warrior alive, or
tanking more, when he goes up 30-100hp?  Of course not.. but it all adds up
:)
