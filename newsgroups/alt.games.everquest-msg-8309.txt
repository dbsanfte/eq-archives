Like? What are you talking about?

If you are referring to the end of the list, I pointed out
that these things were already added, which USED to
be on the list. I left them in to point out to certain mindless
Verant bashers that Verant does indeed listen to and implement
suggestions from users. If they didn't I would have stopped playing
a long time ago.

This EQ game is a far far much better game today than it
was 2 years ago. I can't even imagine going back and playing
back then. The people that have stated playing just recently
have no idea how much better the game is now.
