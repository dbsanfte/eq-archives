/continues to have only a level 24 twink cleric

Perhaps when I actually *care* what the respawn time is, I'll figure it out. 
Like I have done with every other mob that I have had a *reason* to figure
out the spawn time for.

Sorry, but proving to random usenet flamers that a mob in the game acts like
the other thousands of mobs just isn't enough enticement to get me to do the
footwork.  I believe I actually said that already.  :)

Now, do you actually have anything to add to *this* discussion?  Or was that
a not-so-subtle admission that you couldn't come up with anything on-topic?
