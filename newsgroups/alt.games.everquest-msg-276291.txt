Question: If you could live forever, would you and why? Answer: I would not
live forever, because we should not live forever, because if we were
supposed to live forever, then we would live forever, but we cannot live
forever, which is why I would not live forever.
-Miss Alabama, in the 1994 Miss Universe contest
