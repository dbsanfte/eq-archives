I didnt see any mage pet buff spells on the LDoN merchant list =(

There is an augment with an effect called summoners boon from Takish
merchant though which is probably what you're thinking about. 760 points.

Every 10 missions in a theme = 2hp/mna

I think you need at least 70 missions completed in all dungeons to max out
the stone.
