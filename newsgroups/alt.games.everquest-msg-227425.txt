Ack, cut off in the middle of a paragraph!

...or who is willing to claim things are an upgrade that they will 
really sell, or even to those who rapidly powerleveled up to high levels 
without upgrading gear, knowing they could then expect to take advantage 
of groups who will suffer the consequences of their reduced 
effectiveness while at the same time giving the lion's share of the loot 
to them because they are the least well geared.

This stuff doesn't even have to be deliberately intended as a ripoff, 
most of it can be done relatively casually and innocently, you don't 
even have to think of it as ripping people off, you can just think of it 
as educated self interest.

Why hit targets where nothing drops you can use, when there are plenty 
of things you can go after that -can- benefit you?

Why turn down having gear automatically given to you when you can use 
it... or at least nobody else in the group can, and heck, you can sell 
it for a real upgrade?

Sooo easy to be a self centered jerk, especially when all your group 
mates think they are being noble by giving you the drop instead of 
rolling on it.

Splendid
