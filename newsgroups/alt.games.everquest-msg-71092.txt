Get ac instead and then plus mana wis if you can. Forest loops are
good example. If you can't afford forest loops get the player made 3
ac diseas res earring which I think are pretty cheap. The 3 ac on each
ear will do more for you than 3 wis on each ear.
A cleric is going to be getting hit at some time.. and low you are
going to be soloing anyway for a bit probably.


>two velium Jasper rings 7 WIS

Ditto on any kind of AC rings instead, then maybe switch to
the 7 wis later when grouped. Later on after that ac will always be
more of a concern. Most clerics I know eventually switch to the 6 ac
65 hp hit point rings instead of wis ones. When low level, you might
consider the 4 ac 45 hp rings. These are going to help you a LOT more
when low than the mana you get from 14 wis. I know that it will seem
to you to go "wis wis wis wis wis" as a cleric but that is not always
best. There are also some GOOD rings from a skyshrine quest, chamelon
rings, which are 3 ac and 4 wis.. really a lot better than having just
7 wis on a finger.


>Black alloy medallion 6AC 6 INT  6 WIS

Quite an excellent choice, thats really a great item now.
This is kind of the whole cleric idea.. the best AC/wis/man and to a
certain extent hp you can get on pieces.


>Platinum Ruby Veil 7STR 7 WIS

Nice, later getting some kind of ac/wis face would be nice. The thing
is these are WAY overpriced.


>Silver threaded bandana (compliments of werewolf invasion) 2AC 1STA 2WIS
>5 Mana

Fun, low ac though. All those stats are so low as to not matter much
either. For probably 200 plat or less you can get the venerable
standby skull shaped barbute. I think its something like 10 ac or more
and 35 hp, making it one serious amount of bang for you buck. Plus HP
is really going to help you when low (well and even when high to an
extent) more than plus wis or mana.


>Bracer of the Revenant 9AC 5 WIS (the only piece of Cleric armor worth
>getting!)

yes those are quite good.


>Gauntlets of the Black 15AC 4STR 3WIS

Ditto, my twinked cleric at 38 has those, VERY good item, the ac is
GREAT.


>Platinum armband 3STR 3WIS

Great for a druid, try to get some ac arms instead.

>Polished bone bracer 2AC 3WIS 3INT

Nice until another rev bracer.

>Adamite Epaulets 9AC 7WIS

Ye old cleric standby! wearing those on a twink too.


>Chestplate of the Constant 20AC 8STA 5SvMagic

Nice until better, 25 ac enamelled bp can often be had cheap.
Not much diff though. I've seen clerics wearing constant bp until they
get their planes one ;)


>Mammoth Hide Cloak 7AC 4WIS 5SvCold

Ver nice. I was wearing this until just recently I got a cotiere
general cloak with 8 ac and 40 hp which I tend to wear most of the
time now.

>Fine Steel Girdle 9AC

Does that crystal caverns belt with 3 wis fit dwarf clerics? I think
its all all. Those are moderately common and have Ac AND wis so if you
can get one of those its a better deal really (especially if you go to
ac in other slots like ears and rings) Having like 2 or 3 ac in each
ear and 4 or more ac in the ring slots then 3 or more ac in a belt
slot is better and gives you MORE ac than say having just 15 ac in a
belt spot.


>Gatorscale leggings 7AC 4WIS 15 HP

Fine for now, later as cleric would go for higher ac legs even if no
wis.


>Boots of the Reliant 11AC 6SvDisease
>Springwood Club 5WIS 5STR 5INT (who cares what the dam/del ratio is- I'm

>Testament of Vanear 10WIS 10 Mana

Get a charred guardian shield with ac and 9 wis. I don't think those
cost very much anymore.

Nah, at level 1 wis 198 is way too much. You'd be WAY better off
getting ac and hp into quite a few of those slots while still having
reasonable wis. 

Ahah its worse than I thought.. your base wis as a dwarf is max of
118, so i assume you did that since the only other stat you need is
agil of a least 75 and maybe a lil more (for your ac)

http://eq.castersrealm.com/misc/manacalc/manacalc_wis.asp

Your Current Level Is: 1
 
The Base Wisdom For Your Char Is: 118
 
Your Base Mana At This Level Is: 25
 
Your Modified Wisdom Is Now: 198
 
Your Modified Mana At This Level Is: 41
 
Extra Mana As A Result Of Modifiers Is: 16
 
--------------------------

You have 16 extra mana as a result of going from 118 to 198 wis....
---------------------------
At level 19 in same gear...
---------------------------
Based on the information you entered, we have calculated the
folllowing.

Your Current Level Is: 19
 
The Base Wisdom For Your Char Is: 118
 
Your Base Mana At This Level Is: 486
 
Your Modified Wisdom Is Now: 198
 
Your Modified Mana At This Level Is: 790
 
Extra Mana As A Result Of Modifiers Is: 304
-------------------------------------------------------------- 

For example, saying adding more hp and ac you have 175 wis instead:

Your Current Level Is: 19
 
The Base Wisdom For Your Char Is: 118
 
Your Base Mana At This Level Is: 486
 
Your Modified Wisdom Is Now: 175
 
Your Modified Mana At This Level Is: 703
 
Extra Mana As A Result Of Modifiers Is: 217
 
---------------------------------------------------------------

At 19 you have 703 modiefied mana instead of the 790 modified mana
you'd have at 198. The thing is though lets see where that extra wis
went and what you got for it:

7 wis per fingers, conservatively and cheaply changed to the 5 ac 55
hp rings (and you could save the 7 wis ones or sell them to finance
the change) later of course.. or if you could afford to now.. you'd
get the 6 ac 65 hp ones.

So thats minus 14 wis, with a gain of 110 hp and over 10 ac.

Head, Skull shaped barbute, 13 ac, plus 35 hp, plus 10 res magic.

So thats minus 2 wis with a gain of 35 hp and a gain of 11 ac in your
head slot. (now at minus 16 wis total)

Earrings you'd want the forest loops which is same wis but over 4 ac
(since 2 ac you previously did not have in ears) but lets say you
saved some money and got those 3 ac dis res player made earrings that
I think are under 100 plat a pair. Or lets say ORC FANG which are 3 ac
and plus 15 hp each. These are cheap now and it adds 30 hp which again
you are getting more use out of than some extra mana this low.

so minus 6 wis (now at minus 22 wis total)

Okay now lets say you sold off the plat armbands and got at least fine
steel arms which are cheap, so minus 3 wis but plus 10 ac,
or you might even get ulthrok hide arms 8 ac 3 wis and probably 300
plat or less. If someone is selling the cleric quest arms (also usualy
cheap) they are 11 ac.
(now at minus 25 wis total, if not ulthrok) 

So just right there, selling off some of the stuff you might basically
break even or perhaps spend a little more while losing 25 wis or less
so putting you at 173 wis and not that big of a mana loss even at
level 19 (and totally moot before that) while adding a total of:

39 more raw ac, which will translate to higher ac than 39 since you
had no ac in ring or ear or arm slots previously.

175 more hp, even AT LEVEL ONE. Thats assuming you go with the skull
shaped barbute, at least the 55 hp rings and orc fang earrings.

All that at a cost of about 90 mana at level 19 and much less before
that.

Wis is great but by around the time you should possibly have 200 you'd
be getting planes drops which are such insane wis (like 12 wis on the
cleric bp alone) that you'll get there without worrying about it. More
hp and ac is going to help you more before that.

This is kind of the way that I think about it on my cleric level 38
twink, twink her so her wis stays about what the average 38 cleric
might have their wis at but twink her so her ac and hp are more near
what a level 50 cleric might have because clerics are going to get hit
so its going to matter more than the extra mana. Shes at 805 ac with
177 wis and plus 241 hp (at least, forgot some stuff), unbuffed. By
the time shes doing the planes with my guild just 2 items which she'll
probably get by default (the hate bp and legs) will put her at 198 wis
with the same ac about but minus 50 hp and she'll probably get those
right after turning 46.
