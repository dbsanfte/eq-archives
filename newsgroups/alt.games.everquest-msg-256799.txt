If you have MGB EE / SoTW you might fare a little better.

We usually have the MT gain immediate aggro and try to keep Xanamech
facing away from the majority of the raid force (AE stun in the cone). 
Cleric / Druid casts MGB EE / SoTW at the start of the fight and at
50%.

The rest of the fight is a combination of quick heals on the MT and a
periodic group HoT to keep people alive until the end.  The problem
with the CHC during the Xana fight is that you will invariably get
interrupted.

Some people call quick heals, and I guess it depends on your healer
channel preferences.  I don't usually call the quicks.
