All my really rare 'woo woo noone else has this I'm leet wicked dood' 
stuff went poofies when they equip wiped test server.

But I can see rare 'junk' doing things like that. Example:
Recently concluded (August 8th) was 'Summerfest' in Final Fantasy 
online. During summerfest, several rare and unusual things were 
obtainable from the various cute quests:
Yukata (a robe), which is nodrop.
Hand fans, marked with characters for 'festival' or 'summer'. Use them, 
they appear in your hand for 30 seconds or so.
Ghost masks, similar to the hand fans
Paper scoops for scooping goldfish (one of the events)
the goldfish themselves. (only usable to turn in to get things from the 
event npc's)
Several items aquired on a 'spooky cave' type event which could be 
turned in to get Yukata, an upgraded yukata, and then fans, fireworks, 
etc. Otherwise completely useless.
Goldfish bowls (needed to scoop goldfish)

During the event, things like the fans, masks, and scoops were selling 
for 200 gil. Now I see people with fans in their bazaar for upwards of 
1000 gil a piece. I also see fans and masks actually being sold on the 
Auction house for 1000 gil or more. Why? They are firework type items 
that last a handful of seconds and then go away. Because they are now 
impossible to get. At least until next summer, assuming they run the 
same summerfest.
Ah wait, scoops... scoops scoop goldfish. Which are now useless except 
to Mithra, who can eat raw fish. (Yum!) But the stats the fish give are 
the same as common fish, so that's pointless except for the ego trip 
(I'm eatting a fish you can't get anymore! woo!). I'm not even sure you 
can scoop fish anymore.. they may have taken the ability to get goldfish 
back out (it was limited to areas where you could see the big fireworks 
at night.)

Ah well, Halloween will be soon. I hope I can get the pumkin head hat 
they gave out last year, or something similar. It will go well with my 
(light purple) yukata and green worker's pants.
