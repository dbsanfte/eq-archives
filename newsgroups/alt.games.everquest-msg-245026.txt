I'd like to hear some opinions on these two types of distributing raid loot.
I'm currently in a LC type guild. Reason for doing LC is that it's a family
type guild, sporting the "real life > all" approach, which I certainly
understand and respect. Also, raids are not mandatory. If you're online,
you're not required to raid.
HOWEVER, as we're approaching elemental planes (currently only RZtW away),
things have gotten a little more spicy.
We have been raiding a lot more, and it has come to a point, where we have
to cancel certain backflagging raids, because ppl. who already have the flag
in question, will log off or simply stay away, leaving a lot of others
hanging out to dry. It has proven to be the same core of ppl. who will stay
behind again and again.
Personally, I have a nearly 100% raid attendance, simply because it's fun to
raid! If I wanted to exp., a guild wasn't necessary.
The problem, as I see it, is that those ppl. not coming to a lot of raids
will still get awarded the "phat lewtz", simply because it's a big upgrade.
So, is DKP > LC? Or is there another way to assure more ppl. showing up for
raids?

Another point, I was having a little "discussion" with some members of the
LC recently. Nothing heated. Just an exchange of views. It was said that you
shouldn't ask for all drops that you can use, cause it wasn't "good style",
and would put you in bad standing with the LC, and make them hold out on
rewarding you loot for even longer.
As much as I can respect this view, I still somehow feel I'm entitled to ask
for any upgrade from a mob I helped kill? Or am I way off? It's then up to
the LC to award the item to someone else, fair and square. But I just can't
seem to grasp what's so terribly wrong about asking?
I can gather from some of Monual's stories that he sometimes don't ask for
loot for extended periods, simply to be put in a better position when his
dream item drops.
Is this really necessary?

Anyway, I'd like to hear some views on the 2 different approaches to loot
distribution. :-)
