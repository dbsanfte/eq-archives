Ugh.  I would hate that also.  I know you didn't respond to my post, but I would like
to stress that when the higher level group recruited me I stressed to them that I was
below their limit, and when I played, I made damned  sure I did my job to the best of
my abilities.  Now, alot of times the cleric can do things in real life w/o really
affecting their game play.  But I wouldn't really recommend trying this while in a
place where you are in over your level, pretending to be stronger than you are, to a
group that took you in in good faith.

Annie <--- Likes to think she's a really competent cleric, or at least tries to be.
