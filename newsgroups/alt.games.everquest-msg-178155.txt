Excellent, you've identified your problem and the solution to it
in just two lines of text!  You believe that a system designed for
financial transactions, where very strict accuracy and uptime
requirements combine with very simple applications to make updates
exceedingly rare events (which are quite properly viewed with fear
and loathing due to risk involved), is equivalent to a system
designed to play a game, where fairly strict uptime requirements
pose a steady challenge to the service provider due to the very
frequent updates to a moderately complex client application and
its similarly complex server that are required to sustain customer
interest and participation.  So the solution is for you to go
play Visa, or Mastercard, or Amex, or Discover, or some other
exciting financial transaction "game".

Just in case the above was too difficult for you to understand, I'll
summarize for you:  Your comparison demonstrates beyond a reasonable
doubt that you are an idiot.
