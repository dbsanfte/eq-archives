Because they prefer to remember Central America while ignoring Japan
and Europe.  Because our government is still being absurdly vindictive
towards Cuba (we have better relations with the Hanoi, which seems
pretty incredible given that bit o'history).  Because they are opposed
politically to the US for various reasons, some valid and others totally
bogus, and so they highlight the bad and ignore the good.  Because, in
other words, they're fairly typical human beings engaged in partisan
squabbling that's not different in any meaningful way from our domestic
politics (or theirs, for that matter).

And, IMO, both of these threats are and have been more real and
immediate than Iraq.  It was Saudi money that financed 9/11.  While
we are be allied with the Saudi government, there are powerful and
wealthy factions in Saudi Arabia (not least of them bin Laden
himself!) that are supporting and sponsoring terrorist attacks
throughout the world.

Ok, semantics.  I don't see any reason to limit the definition of
a military threat to the capability to invade (or at least bomb)
US soil.  Otherwise what would be the point of allying with us?
Iraq does threaten some of our allies militarily, and if those
alliances are to have any meaning that threat has to be treated as
a threat against us.

It might increase the risk.  Alternatively forcibly removing him from
power might increase the risk (short term anyway).  I don't think that
argument has a whole lot of force as far as dealing with SH goes.  I
just don't see him posing a substantial threat in that manner.  I am
frankly a lot more worried about extremist Saudi factions, like the
one that destroyed the WTC on 9/11.

I disagree.  I cannot imagine China giving Korea nuclear weapons.
In fact, given the massive conservative bent of Chinese culture and
recent Chinese regimes I am surprised that they did not try to stop
North Korea from developing nuclear weapons (or maybe they did and
we just never heard about it).

I'm willing to accept that as your intent.  It is not at all what
you said tho.  Your words were "If you think oil is a factor...".
The government cannot admit that oil is a factor, because then
they would lose face, so they deny it and open themselves up to
accusations of dishonesty.  Of course, most opposition politicians
avoid making the accusations themselves, because then their own
"lies by omission" would become fair game, so you have important
issues being raised by people who appear naive and/or crackpot,
which the ruling faction then points out in an attempt to bolster
their position by deflecting attention from the lies themselves.
And that's just the top level of the machinations going on, kinda
sickening when you stop to think that this sort of bullshit may
well lead to tens of thousands of deaths, and all parties are
complicit in these deaths at some level (tho some, like SH, are
rather obviously far more responsible than others for the mess).

Could be.
