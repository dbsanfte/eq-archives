Squire is a title, like knight, king, queen, Lord etc. Therefore its
basically forbidden by the name rules. Or at least it was in the past.

In any event someone got a bit overzealous in bothering to change that
name when I see people running around with names like Nekro Filliac.

9: "Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to:
The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon,
Lordeagle, Mothermaggy, Darksister). "

Squire basically is similar.


"For categories 3 through 11, the member of the Customer Service Team
will contact you either in game or via email to notify you of the
character's name change. After your name is changed, any corpses
currently in the world will no longer be accessible. Please inform a
Customer Service Team member if you have a current corpse prior to the
name change"


So someone should have contacted you. If not I'd keep pushing the
issue.
