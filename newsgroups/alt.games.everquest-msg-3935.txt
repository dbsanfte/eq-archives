OK, you are a cynic.  When I tell someone to Make an offer (which is
pretty rare) it is usually because the item isnt high demand or doesnt
have a large market.  The Helm of Rile is a good example.  I know that
it may take a while to get it, but the helm itself is worth between
700pp and 1k.  When I was taking offers, I wasnt hoping to find
someone that wanted to give me 2k for it, I honestly didnt really know
what I wanted for it, there were days you could have offered me 400pp
and I might have taken it and other days I probably wouldnt take any
less than 800pp.  It had nothing to do with "suckering" anyone.  Then
again maybe I am an exception.  I doubt it.
