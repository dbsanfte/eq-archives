Actually, from personal experience it does.  Those in my guild (thankfully
most) that wanted to keep up with flags, even ones that initially lagged
behind, were taken care of because they put in the effort.  There are, of
course, a few that don't put in any effort at all and then complain that
they're being left behind.  To those I respond, well duh.

Yeah...  so you're saying that you should be allowed to solo Vulak?

/ooc Emperor is camped!
/reply No you can't join me.  I'm soloing!

Sometimes I wonder if people like you actually think about what you're
saying.  Then I read it again and realize that no actual thought went into
it at all.
