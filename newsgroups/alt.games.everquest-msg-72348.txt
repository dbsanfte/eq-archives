It's also clear what "sow plz" means. It means, simulataneously,
"Would you please cast Spirt of Wolf on me?" and "I'm too much of a
dipwad to ask properly".

As long as people who can't be bothered to communicate clearly and/or
observe the accepted conventions of the communications forum get what
they want *despite* their laziness and/or self-appointed L337-ness,
they won't have any motivation to act differently.
