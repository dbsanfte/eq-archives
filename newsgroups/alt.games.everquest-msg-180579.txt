Fact is, you're not worrying about the high end game with five people,
so your options are more open. I see lots of folks reccomending Warrior
as one of your five. Pshaw. If they know their shit and you get them
some decent gear for their level, an SK tanks as well as a warrior up
into the forties and brings a lot more to the table. (Excellent aggro
holding ability with spells, snare, the list goes on.) You could also
stick a Pally or Ranger in that slot, with each bringing a nice add to
the group's abilities, but personally I'd prefer an SK.

Don't cheap out on the healer. Go with a cleric. You'll get all the
rezzes at the earliest possible level, some kick ass buffs, and they are
more durable in a tough fight than trying to use another class that's
already over burdened with colateral duties and drawing aggro.

There's a lot of crossover between enchanters and shaman, but later on
the things that do make them unique are vital. Plus they *can* share
some duties and do backup if somebody is absent of just gets smacked
down in a fight. So the third and fourth slots, IMO, to to Chanter
Shammy. This also gives you SoW at a very early level and crowd control
and mana enhancement early on.

For the last slot, the group above simply needs more damage. Many
classes can do a lot of damage, but as it has always been, Monks and
Rogues have those special things you'll need for certain situations
while pouring on the DPS. There's a few places you must have a rogue to
pick locks, and they are *great* at CR, but there are so many more
places that a good FD puller is required to split spawns, etc. that I'd
go with the monk.

With that powerhouse of a group, besides, you can always just annouce
your'e looking for a pickup rogue to round out your group and they'll be
jumping at the chance to join you.

Yes, this leaves you without a porter, but if you all have PoP, is that
really such a big deal anymore?
