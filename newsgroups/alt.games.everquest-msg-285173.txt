Cleric?  Sure, if your dream is to have everyone killing the MT.

I didn't say puller, I said Main Assist; that is, the guy who, at any 
moment in the battle, if you assist him, you get the target you're 
supposed to be killing.

If your guild has so many clerics you can spare one to the MA position, 
well, thats an interesting guild.

I think I've narrowed it down to tank #4; someone with the AC and HP to 
survive some ancillary damage, but who hopefully won't be getting aggro 
and dying.  Particularly if he understands the importance of the MA 
position, so that he makes a particular effort to avoid aggro, even if 
it means reducing his DPS.

Since he's a Tank (which is to say Warrior, SK, or Paladin) his DPS 
isn't all that huge anyway, and sacrificing some of it won't be as bad 
as sacrifing that of a DPS class.

Following that logic further, it also shouldnt' be a paladin, who might 
actually have useful spot heals and buffs... so we're down to SK and 
Warrior.  Anything useful an SK is going to do, he's going to do it to 
the mob itself.  And if he gets aggro, he can FD or HS, not my normal 
response to trouble, but assuming the MT or anyone else further up the 
food chain is still alive, this shouldnt' be a problem.

Meanwhile, warriors, at least on combine at the moment, are fairly rare 
on the ground, so the odds aren't too good there will be a spare... but 
it seems to me they'd also be a good option for the job.

Discovering, quite by accident, another role for the class I'm currently 
playing, is not a bad thing.  Currently I'm usually MT or ST, so I won't 
actually fit the role, but its something for the future.
