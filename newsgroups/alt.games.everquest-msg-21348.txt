All very true.

I play using cable in Australia and average 300-400ms ping times also which
is completely usable. Regularily logging on when only 600 people are
connected is a pretty big advantage too...

*huge grin*

Packet loss brings me to my knee's sometimes - that's when I head to town
and catch up on non-combat and tradeskills. If the worst comes to worse -
there is also the option of ripping myself away from the screen for long
enough to see whether the girlfirend still exists, and whether the cat is
still alive etc...
