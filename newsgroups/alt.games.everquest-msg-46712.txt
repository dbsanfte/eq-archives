While I agree that the 51 to 60 game has radically altered the role
of many classes (and not usually for the better) I don't think you
can look at this as a nerf per se.  That 50 mage of yours has
all the abilities he did two years ago (more or less)... its just that
the abilities he has added as he goes up thru the fifties don't keep
pace with those of other classes, or of the mobs he faces.

To be Nerfed, an actual ability has to be taken away from you,
not simply not added at higher levels.  IMNSHO of course
