Well.. I really have never put anyone on an ignore list in my 3+ years of
playing, and if I did it was because they were spamming the zone in which
case I just put them on until I left the zone.  However something happened
to me a few nights ago that really pissed me off to the extent that I still
have this person on my list.
     I was in BB trying to get a LDoN group when I get a msg from a cleric
asking if I want to form one with him.  I accept the invitation and the two
of us try to gather more.  Maybe 30 min go by and we finally get the last
member of out party. I was in no real hurry, and neither was he so we took
our time and got a solid group together.  The last member was a ranger that
he had grouped with before and wanted in the group again.  So he, a cleric,
stays behind to get a mission while me and the others head for LF. Upon
zoning into LF the cleric realizes that the ranger is out of my level range
(too low) and announces that the only fair thing to do is for me and him to
roll to see who gets to stay.  I more or less exploded, something else I
have never done in a group.  I told him, in group, that if he was going to
do that after I had set with him from the beginning trying to form up a
group..while the ranger had been looking all the way of 30 secs before his
invite, then I would just leave.  Maybe I shouldn't have left but I had the
feeling that it could only get worse from there.  I added the cleric to my
ignore list because I certainly did not want to group with this person
again...especially if later down the road he asked me to help form a group
with him without me remembering who he is.
