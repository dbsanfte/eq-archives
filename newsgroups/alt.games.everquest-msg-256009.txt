Ok, here is what the difference of "casual" vs. "raider" started from
and where it was at the time of PoP.  I'm just going to compare war
BPs since I'm lazy and also look only at HP and AC on them.

Indicolite BP (Raid)
AC 35 HP 0           

Crafted BP (1 Group)
AC 22 HP 25

Enameled Black BP (1 Group)
AC 25 HP 0

The % difference is raid vs. "casual" done by (raid-casual)/raid for each is

Indicolite 
AC   0%
HP   0%

Crafted
AC 37%
HP well heh infintely better. :)

EBBP
AC 28%

Now for PoP stats
Kizrak's BP
AC 64
HP 115

Raex
AC 100
HP 250

And %'s
Kizrak
AC 36%
HP 54%

Heh didn't come out quite as expected but there seems to be a trend in at
least AC that's semi-consisted.  That being raid vs. non-raid is about a
35% difference.  The big one however is the HP delta.  Pre-Kunark we see there
was really effectively 0 difference in raid BP HP vs. non-raid BP HP.  Now
there is a bigass difference.  

I didn't include effects or stats here but I'd imagine that the difference in
those are more in line with the HP difference than the AC one.
