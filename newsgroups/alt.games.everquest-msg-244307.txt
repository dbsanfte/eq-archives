Honestly, the in-game functionality bugs me. I more often find myself 
looking for recipes of items I need to make to gain skill than those that 
are trivial. Therefore, I wind up hitting EQTraders more often than not 
anyway. Does anyone really experiment with different unknown recipes 
anymore?

It *is* nice when I do need to do some trivial combines, though.
