its just an opinion, but in the higher levels the announcement to the
group about the assist is not needed (it should be a given)...
BUT,   <<there it is....   on the younger side of the game, not all
are versed in the ways of the group.  I find that the group
announcements help out the Newbie, to learn who to assist on, etc.
I remember my first days, and know I was extremely clueless.  The
messages put out by the groups I was in, were EXTREAMLY helpful.
but that could be due to the fact that I'm a little dense sometimes. 
: )

good hunting.
