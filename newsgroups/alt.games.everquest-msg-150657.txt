Sure it can. Hell mines 450 with 16mb graph, and I managed to start a Cat.
Had no major frame rate issue at all with clip plane on minimum ;) It must
look so different to those who can see past their nose... for me its quite

One day when I upgrade I'll go back and have a look at the place for the 1st
