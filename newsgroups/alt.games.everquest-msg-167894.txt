There use dto be more. And they all re-popped in about 10 min IIRC. They
were intentioanlly nerfed to keep people from doing what you are saying. The
Gobs were put there for the Paly Ghoulbane quest, and they turned out to be
the perfect 30ish quad target. So all the low level Palys got to sit around
and watch higher level characters come into the newbie zone and camp their
quest mobs.
