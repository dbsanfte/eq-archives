AT&T promised that "former Mediaone customers are not affected" by the
excite bankruptcy. Former Mediaone customers critically needing
internet connectivity were actively dissuaded by AT&T from seeking an
alternative since the Excite bankruptcy was announced. If you are a
disconnected Mediaone customer, I suggest you contact your state's
attorney general.
