    Five: the slower...

    But wait, slower classes ALL fit into other categories too! Chanter and
to a (much) lesser extent, shammies are also CC! Shammies can also heal
(arguably)! Beastlords can also kinda tank and are definitely DPS. (other
classes can kinda slow but leaving them out for now)

    I really like your approach, but you can't leave slows out, they are as
important as heals, (I can actually tank higher level slowed mobs without a
healer than unslowed mobs with one)

    I think at the end of the day balance is about group and raid
desirability, and some classes come out far, far ahead of others, and that
is a valid issue for those on the receiving end, who may have invested five
years of their spare time *and* a thousand dollars into their character.

    An example of this is the chanter, who is the best the best crowd
control by far, is an extremely close second in slows and until recently was
arguably the best DPS class as well. They are compulsory on raids and in
many group situations, and can solo their entire career better than most
other classes. An example of a class that does not do so well is perhaps the
Shadowknight (trying to speak of only what I know here), who is arguably a
distant third best tank, isn't second, third, or fourth best at any of the
other major functions, has far less group desireability, almost no raid
desirability, and cannot realistically solo above their mid 50's.

    Yes you are dead right in asserting that if you set out to ignore this
kind of crap and have fun, you are more likely to enjoy your game than if
you complain about what you see is wrong, but the same can be said of all
sorts of things in life that probably should *not* be put up with.

    It also depends on your play style. If you put effort into your
character with a competitive spirit and a view to advancement, it's a little
harder to ignore these things than if you're more the roleplayer, the
quester, or the casual groupoid.
