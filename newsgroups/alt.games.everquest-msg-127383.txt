The most important 2 things for backstab numbers are
(1) your backstab skill, and (2) the base damage of the
weapon that you're using.

While at level 60 a Locustlure (8/17) might outdamage
a Slime Coated Harpoon (10/25) due to the damage
modifier, you'll NEVER see higher backstabs with the
LL as opposed to the SCH because the base damage
of the first is worse.

Heck, if I had a 40/200 piercer I could use I'd go crazy
with it in W. FP on fire beetles and such, just to get the
cute 5000 damage screenshots, but I'd never use the
thing in a "real" fight.

Finding a good balance between your damage bonus
and your backstab numbers can be tricky, but if ALL
you're interested in is the higher backstab, get a higher
damage piercer.

Period.
