I'm pretty sure that Ben is right. I know I've lost items that the GM
wouldn't replace because (according to the GM) there was no record of
my character owning them. I lost them when the bazaar went down while
I was doing a transfer and they were items that I'd just gotten as
drops about an hour before. The items that I'd had longer (at least a
couple of days) were replaced at that time. 

Rgds, Frank
