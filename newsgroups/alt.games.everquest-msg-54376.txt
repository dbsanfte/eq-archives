This is probably the best reason for leaving the message on I've seen.

Since we all agree that the player developed manners system in place
in EQ makes unasked inspection rude, getting that message does
identify someone as not participating in that manners system.

Unfortunately, that person might be an actual newcommer to the game
who doesn't know that its rude; after all, the mechanism is there, and
there's no build in hotkey to ask first with.  But getting snubbed a few
times, and then having the principle explained to you gently with a
brickbat, should rapidly teach the newcommer what the consensus
is on the issue.

Since I don't really care about being inspected, I'm leaving my message
off, I'm too lazy to be a part of passing on this little quirk of the
body politic.  I'll have to find out how rude some people are in
other ways... not like there aren't plenty of em!

ps; if verant put in a filter, like the adult language filter, that automatically
turned plz into please, and thx into thanks, would you use it?
