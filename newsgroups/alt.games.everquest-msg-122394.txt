You need to help one side win.
By saying you need owl bear pelts then I take it the Owl bear caves are
under the control of either sonic wolves or grimlings. Go to whichever
location is still held by the other side and wait for the defenders to spawn
outside, then kill them. Warning, they hit pretty hard for their level and
will summon but seem to be rooted to the spot so you can normally take one
at a time.
Once one side controls the zone go to the trading outpost near Big Kitty
City and look out for a named spawn of the winning race, kill him and the
sides all reset.
