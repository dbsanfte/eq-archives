While you do have that power, and a warning should be sufficient, issuing
the warning is a bad idea.  While there is no way to prove that someone
trained you or KS'd you or anything like that by looking at logs, its a simple
matter to report the ten lines in which you issued your warning.  If for
any reason the people you warned subsequently get wiped, they can
easily send in that report and then claim that the dead bodies are the
result of your making good on the threat.  The combination of threat and
a pile of dead bodies is going to look awful bad for you.  Just as there is
no way to prove that you trained them, there's no way for you to prove
that you didn't.
