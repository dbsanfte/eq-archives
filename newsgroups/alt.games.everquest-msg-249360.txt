Aware? Yes. As the evening entertainment? No.

Does the public have a right to know? Yes. Does the public deserve to 
have its basest carnal lust for a perpetual freak show of sex and death 
pandered to? Also, sadly, yes.

Does that make it a 'good thing'? No.

This is a tangent... but the media *is* a profit oriented business, not 
an altruistic news reporting organization. They cover whatever the most 
people will watch because the higher the ratings get the better the ad 
revenue. Period.

Responsible journalists would interview lawyers for holes in the case, 
processes that weren't observed, and report other issues pertinent to 
the fact that the society is about to collectively kill someone.

Instead we're bombarded with interviews with a victim's family with 
pointless questions like: 'Have you forgiven him?' 'What would you like 
to say to him?' and 'Do you think he deserves to die?' like some hick 
who lost their kid facing the imminent death of the killer is likely to 
be in an objective frame of mind.

Then they report what the man selected to eat for his last meal. They 
show clips of him getting shuttled around with ominous voice overs 
spouting drivel on par with Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous... "and 
here he walks down the last hallway... where 145 violent offenders 
walked before him...joining such company as <insert recent headline 
murderer> who also had strawberries and whip cream for dessert..." Pure 
drivel.
