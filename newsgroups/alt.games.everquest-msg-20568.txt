WoW, you guys are tough on the personal attacks. I  have no lack of self
worth, and do not depend on the attention of others, altho it is attention I
seek. Attention to sway others to my point of view, which I think I can do
without namecalling, cussing, or comments on ones self image . I do not
"gangsta rap", frag people, nor am I a "dood" I have spent many hours in
roleplay games, I know what roleplay is, and I also know that roleplay means
YOU playing YOUR character how YOU think it should be played. Ok EQ has
rules, thats fine, I am NOT promoting breaking rules, I am promoting change.
