All of my characters are female except my warrior.  I honestly think a *male
barbarian* warrior is more likely to get chosen for a group than a *female
barbarian* warrior.  (But, since he/she usually gets invited using the /lfg
tool the inviter rarely even knows what he/she is getting until I show up).  
And I'm a little uncomfortable trying to remember to behave like a man... you
know... running up to the half naked female druid sitting in POK and saying
things like: "scuse me perty lady... me big slow dumb warrior, you please give
me SoW for donation??"  Then bowing and thanking her profusely.... (I kinda get
a kick out of this tactic).
Or, even worse, turning to the *male* paladin in the group and accidentally
calling him *hun* because it's easier to type than Bigburlyscythecarrier.  I'm
sure *that* really made an impression coming from a male barbarian.
EEKK!! Then there was the female chanter that kept sending me /tells coming
onto me in a LDON group.  (She probably WAS a guy.... hehe.... ) 
That kind of thing....  Ok everyone reading this... try to see the humor in it
:))
