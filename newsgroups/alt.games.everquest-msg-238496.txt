I'm not particularly adept at writing compelling narative, so I'll spare you
the story.  The item I worked the longest for and subsequently has been the
most rewarding is my Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl.  I was new to the world
of tradeskilling when I began that massive quest.  Many friends, guild
mates, and total strangers helped me along the way..  When I did the combine
for the 7th shawl, I sat in PoK for over an hour just looking at it.  When I
finished the battle for the 8th shawl, I was so excited and proud and happy
and... it was a great feeling.  The prayer shawl quest was the most
rewarding for me because it had the perfect balance of solo and group
content.  The brunt to the work was simple self-reliance with tradeskill
skill ups and gathering components, but the rarer and more exotic components
required me to draw upon my friends and work as a team.  Subsequent in game
rewarding moments have been mostly centered around guild team work.  When we
beat Emp with 31 people or finally killing RZtW on our 6th try after
slaughtering all the lesser PoP gods on our first.  I love my guild mates,
but earning my prayer shawl back in the 50s was really my greatest personal
victory, and it had an oh so sweet reward.
