Allow me to share my experiences quadkiting. I hunted wyverns from 49
to 55 and otters til 60 in Cobalt Scar.

Level 57 took me one week.
Level 58 took me one week.
Level 59 took me 8 days.

On their own merits I'm sure shamans do extremely well soloing. If you
factor in Cobalt Scar, I find it difficult to imagine anyone being
able to level faster than a druid from 49 to 60.
