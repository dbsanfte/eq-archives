Good to hear.  I'll put him on our radar.

She's way out of our league for now, it seems.  Thanks for the 
confirmation.

We took out triggered Fay in no time at all, so if Talendor isn't that much 
harder, we should be ok, assuming he doesn't romp on top of us as we buff 
up.

Are Juggs charmable?  Rootable?  Casters?  I know our 62 RNG has been to 
Juggs, but I don't think anyone else has.

We're mainly mid-50s.  We have a 60 LC, 62 RNG, 60 RNG, 60 Shm, 59 Pal.  
Highest warrior is one level short of /disc defensive.

Thanks for the reply, it's very helpful.
