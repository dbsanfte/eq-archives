It would sort of put a huge dent in the viability of shaman in that 
expansion.  Anything else we can do aside from slowing is much better 
done by others.  Clerics would still be the premier healers, even without 
CH, so I don't see a big problem there.  Realistically, they'd have to 
throw us shaman something that makes us at least semi useful in such an 
expansion.  I'm not saying there is nothing we could do in such an 
expansion as it is, just that we would be highly undesirable as part of a 
group, and would be practically unable to solo.  Groups would still want 
a cleric or a druid as the healer, as they do now, and be much less 
likely to settle for a shaman in that role if the mobs are unslowable and 
tuned for cleric/druid healing.
