If you just some easy +int earrings and are into questing, sell the ring for PP
then go to the Qeynos Aqueducts and do the Lucia's Dress quest.  The reward is
a +3 int earring.  It is a very nice lower end quest that is pretty easy if
your level 8 or higher.  The Allakhazam page is:

Hope that helps.
