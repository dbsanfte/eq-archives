As long as you do even one point of damage to the mob, then you can
get credit for the kill.  However, its quite possible to get a DS so 
large that it will kill a mob so fast that you, with your lowbie skill 
levels, end up not hitting the mob even once.

The even con and yellow con mobs have more hp, meaning they live longer, 
and that gives you more opportunities to get that minimum of one hit in.

A very effective way to use a high DS, as a lowbie, to get exp very 
quickly, is to aggro large numbers of mobs and allow the DS to do the 
killing; thing is, you still need to damage each mob at least once, so 
you end up spinning around like mad trying to change targets and wait 
for a hit... or you can use spells which do damage to all mobs near you, 
or you can pull the mobs with something that does damage (archery, 
throwing, a DD spell); anyway, point is, the few mobs you end up missing 
while doing this will each poof giving you no exp and no loot.
