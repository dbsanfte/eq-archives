I have toolbox in one of my slots.  It is weighs 3.0, holds 8
items, 0% weight reduction, and holds GIANT items.

Inside I have 3 things - Birthday cake, flasks of water, fish rolls.

When I click on it (put it on my pointer), my stats have the following
changes.

   AC  +30
   AC  +2
   STA +5
   AGI +5
   DEX +5

My weight does not change.

Why would picking up the toolbox (which has no stat enhancers and
is holding no stat enhancers) result in all those changes?
