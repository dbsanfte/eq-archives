Before Verant took away server numbers, there were as many as 2400 people
playing in American Prime Time (midnight - 4am GMT)...and yet, like someone
else mentioned, it's possible you can go into a zone and be the only one
there.  GOOD zones, too!

Dak is obviously a powergamer.  If that's what you are, listen to him.  If
you're in it for the ADVENTURE, ignore him.
