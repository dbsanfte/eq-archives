The explanation that makes the most sense, considering that all the
official documentation stated that *humans* got an XP bonus, and
considering that, I believe, Verant even insisted that humans did get an
XP bonus and that halflings did not, right up until people with ShowEQ
proved them wrong, is that it is a bug.  Note that "halfling" and
"human" are next to each in alphabetical order, so if someone simply
swapped entries in a table somewhere, it could introduce this bug.

They did not fix it because changing the XP tables for the two races
would have changed some people's levels, which they do not want to do.
They could have done a retroactive adjustment, but they are very
reluctant to make offline changes to the player database.

Eventually, they figured out that changes to the XP table could be made
without changing the database and without affecting existing levels by
adding multipliers to XP changes.  That was how they eliminated class
penalties.  E.g., INT casters used to have a 10% XP penalty, which was
implemented in their class XP tables.  Rather than change the tables to
get rid of the penalty, they simply made it so anything that gives XP
gives a 10% bonus to INT casters, and anything that takes XP away takes
an extra 10% away from INT casters.  They could fix the halfling bonus
that way if they wanted, and give humans the bonus instead.
