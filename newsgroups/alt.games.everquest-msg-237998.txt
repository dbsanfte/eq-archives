I understand your view, but we met just as I described.  I remember, since I
was new to the game, I was trying that damned jboots quest, at OOT camping
that AC a couple months later.  I would log on at 2 or 3AM and within 5 damn
mins of logging in, I would hear from her.  "Whatcha doin?  Where you goin?"
She would look for me at first.  Once she had me interested, she became
aloof.  I brought this behavior up to her recently, before the husband
confrontation.  Conversation went something like this:

ME:  You know, there used to be a time when you would bother me a few
minutes after I logged on.  Now, you've relegated me to the position of EQ
stalker, instead of telling me what it is you want.
SHE:  I know.

And that was it!  LOL.   Like I said in reply to another post, I should have
left her shortly after I met her.  Yup, I'm thick-headed I guess.  I just
couldn't believe that the person I knew through the game would begin to
treat me the way she did.  But she did, and that's that.
