They all stack... some are more useful than others though.  When doing
Elysians in Umbral, I use


1) Epic Wrath of Nature (clickable)
2) Drones of Doom (Off Bracer, clickable)
3) Winged Death
4) Creeping Doom


Can also stack the "Fire type DOTS" but of no use on Elysians cause they
fizzle too much (even for a 61 Druid) and they are resisted often, at least
by Elysians.



The short of it, they stack, all of em.


Hope that helps...
