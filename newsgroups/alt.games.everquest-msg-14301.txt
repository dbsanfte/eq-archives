You're talking seantics. Let me be explicit, then :)

EQ initially was fun for the learning and
challenge and RP - the exploration. Then, once I knew the world and
game system pretty good it was fun for the pretty new effects and
toys I got as I went up. Then once I'd been playing a while it was
fun because I'd made lots of GOOD friends whos company I enjoyed. thats
why I play now - my friends.

If my character got nuked and I had to start again I wouldnt find the
exploration fun - I already know whats going to happen. I wouldnt
enjoy the mechanisms, I've worked them before. I wouldnt be ABLE to play
with my friends, they're too high level.

I have "spent", if you prefer the term to "invested", a significant amount
of time in Norrath and what I've achieved there means something to me,
Sui, the person behind the keyboard ;) ;)

I dont want someone to pay me for that - the pleasure I get with my friends
in game is my return on that investment. I do care that I can safeguard it
and continue to enjoy it :) ;)

Thats all I was saying, its really quite simple ;)

Sui
