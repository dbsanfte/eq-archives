Well I was only half serious, and I certainly won't contribute to any Reso
vs. FnF trash-talking here, I get enough of that in game! To be fair, in
many people's eyes they would probably be considered top dog since they've
killed Quarm and we are still working on it. I have friends in both guilds
and even group with some FnF still from time to time. It's funny, we're like
soldiers meeting on neutral ground, sharing some good times for a few
moments and then heading back out on the battlefield to shoot at each other
