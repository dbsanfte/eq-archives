I agree. Maybe it was just a bug of some kind. It wasn't your
ordinary "looks like a tiny bag until you pick it up" item.
That's what I would expect this "oblong bottle", that the
previous poster mentioned, to look like. It was around 3-4
times the size of an ordinary bag and it wouldn't respond to
any sort of interaction. It appeared to be part of the
ground in the same way that the boards and stuff lying around
Freeport are part of the background. It could be the
spawn point for the bottle and it wasn't "alive" because
no-one had activated the quest recently.

One of those unexplained mysteries, I guess.
