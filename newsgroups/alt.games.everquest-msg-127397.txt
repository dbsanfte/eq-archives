Grats.. but when are you ever in a group where everyone wants PoTG?
Real question is, whats the point at which its cheaper to have clerics, wizards,
and anyone else who'd rather keep their self buff on move away from
cast range?

If (as I've often seen) its just you and the hybrid who want PoTG effects,
isn't it handy to have that single target version available?  Or when buffing up
the dead guy?  I sure wish Heroism was overwritten by Heroic Bonds,
the savings is significant but its a pain to get people to drop it when its
time to refresh group.
