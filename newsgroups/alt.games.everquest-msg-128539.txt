Note, however, that the MQ has to be done in the Plane of Air.

Our guildleader is a mage and had spent weeks looking for
the cloak with no luck, so when a few of us guildies were
hanging around SK about to go into Splitpaw for a mini-raid,
we jumped on Quillmane when we saw her go by.

The cloak dropped, and one of my guildmates looted it
for our guildleader -- with her level 24 Ranger alt that
she doesn't play very often...

She "eeked" when I looked up the quest and told her that
in order to do the MQ for our guildleader, she was going
to have to get to at least planes-level with that character.
