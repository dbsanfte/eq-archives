We will see. My gut feeling tells me that the game that releases
second will gain the "this isn't as good as I hoped" crowd which for
mmorpgs is a very sizable proportion of the playerbase. The one that
releases first will get hammered with "this needed more testing" word
of mouth.

Most people may only have time to play one or the other but they will
still *try* both. Will they go back to the first?
