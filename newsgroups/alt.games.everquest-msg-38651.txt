The best part of it looks to be the fast-paced action.  I've been waiting
for a long
time for a game that had action like Diablo 1&2, that was an MMORPGDTIALA.
They say there will be very little downtime, and the graphics are very good
so
far.  Between this and SW:G  I won't have time to do anything.
But since they're not coming out for years and years, I guess I better go
back
to playing my Enchanter.
