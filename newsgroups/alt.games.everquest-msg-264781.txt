This sounds very interesting actually, if I can set it to voiceover 
ONCE, and the various music volumes off... I don't mind the noises, its 
the repetition that gets to me.

Clever line = fun.  Clever line for the third time = boring.  Clever 
line 50 times later?  Camo paint and Exlax Tipped blowgun darts ready, 
I'm off to seek revenge on whoever did that damn voiceover, the author 
of the lines, and every SOE employee who could have had it stopped but 
didn't... including the janitor who could have passed a large 
electromagnet over the storage media.
