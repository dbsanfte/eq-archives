Hehe.. they DO exist tho, but are rare as hell :P

Well.. to say it like this.. If you see anyone below level 10 that is in the
bazaar, it is 90 percent sure it is not a "new" player indeed! Yes it has
become very easy to travel now with pop, but there are major amounts of "I
need just 1000 plat for a new item.. plz!!" doodes.. aargh..

But.. That said i wanna share once i met a true noob..

We were gathering up just inside WFreeport zoneline for a lucan kill.. Was
about 4-5 peeps i think, and buffed up and such.. Suddenly this lvl 2
warrior came up to us and looked at us. Said something like "Hi".. and not
much really..
So.. She said "Are you from the same group or something.. You all have the
same name under your names?" (Referring to our guildtag..). Explained that
and she asked what we were doing.. Told her what we were doing and she goes
"oh wow"..

So.. next our monk had to grab a rr break, and like all monks he goes FD
when he leaves.. The n00b suddenly goes "WOW.. he died! What did you do to
him?" We all had to laugh and figured.. this gotta be a REAL one.. indeed..
a REAL one :)
We all tossed in som plat's and all the stuff we could spare, buffed her and
what we could.. She was just "Wooow.. thank you very much.. you guys are
great!! wow" and so on :)

Truly a happy moment..
