FYI, there is a bug on recommended level weapons.  All the stats are
lower indeed, but the Damage is still the full damage possible, not
the recommended damage for your level.  This is a bug that has been
there from day one of the recommended level weapons.
Oh, yes it will do the full damage unless you have a damage cap.  
i.e. damage cap up to 10 is 20 its damage, 10 -19 is 30, and I believe
the cap is removed at level 20.

Good luck.
