I quit about a week ago just prior to them beginning to
charge the monthly fee.

I gave it a good shot hoping I'd find something worth staying 
for and was willing to put up with all the bugs and technical
problems running the game. However it became apparent
to me that the game at it's very core is very shallow, and the
gameplay repetitive and boring.

In games such as UO and EQ, there are repetitive actions which
we have to go through in order to advance, but the difference is
there's a carrot we chase, and a reward when we catch it. In AO
there is the illusion of a carrot with an unsatisfying reward.

Where I believe funcom went wrong, is they tried to take various
features from games such as The Realm, UO, EQ and AC, refine 
and in some cases improve upon those features, and combine 
them into a single game naively thinking that alone would produce 
a winner.

Unfortunately all they took were the esthetics, mechanics and 
execution but forgot the raison d'ï¿½tre. It's a cold game with no
heart or soul. All style--no substance.
