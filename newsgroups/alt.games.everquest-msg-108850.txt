riiiiiiight.  In the GAME, I'll kill just about anything that moves if it'll
give me XP and not totally screw me over faction-wise (unless I can easily
fix it).

In real life, I will catch a spider and take it outside and release it
because I don't want to kill it.

Guess I'm an enigma, eh?

It's a game.  they're pixels. zeros and ones.  they don't have feelings,
they don't have a soul, hell, they're not even AWARE (although some will
probably argue that point, and to a VERY VERY limited point, they are
"aware" but that is a whole different discussion - see next sentence).
They're a script running on a piece of machinery, set to perform certain
actions when certain conditions are met. nothing more, nothing less. they
are there for entertainment purposes. it's not good, it's not evil, it's
entertainment.
