Wrong, strike one.  Don't fall for the partisan spin, Ed.

Bush's business history has been put under the microscope
countless times now, and even the summaries written by
his staunchest opponents don't document anything
even remotely resembling his being "a lousy businessman".

On the contrary, he managed to long keep afloat an oil
exploration business during a period (known in the
industry as the "oil crunch") when major corporations
were falling.  That takes real savvy.  I've been in
the "awl bidness" myself for twenty years; many of
our clients vanished on us, including those which
used to own twenty-story buildings in major cities.
No dummy could keep an exploration company solvent
during those grim times.  (Sample industry joke:
"Q: How do you get an oil manager out of a tree? 
 A: Cut the rope.")

Was he helped by his family connections?  Sure.
But if you think that's unusual, or a sign of someone
who couldn't make it any other way, you're clearly
ignorant of what business is really like.  Only
a "lousy businessman" would fail to make the most
of the connections he had.  But you're grossly
misrepresenting the situation when you say that he
succeeded "only" because of "family" money.  His
actual "family" invested a minor amount of money
into his businesses, and it was hardly enough to
make a make-or-break difference.  Do you have
any idea how much money it takes to operate
even a small business year after year?

And you seem to have "forgotten" to credit him
with personally brokering the deal for the purchase
of the Texas Rangers and the building of their
stadium, and his hands-on management of that
franchise which turned a $46 million purchase
into a business which was eventually worth
(and sold for) $250 million.  Bush was, by
all accounts, the central figure in that success.

From Richard Greene, former mayor of Arlington
(the home of the Rangers):

   "The fact is that the signatures on the master
   agreement between the city and the Rangers
   describing the deal to build The Ballpark in
   Arlington include mine and Bush's. It wasn't
   Bush's father who negotiated the contract.
   It was George W. -- in a leadership role as managing
   partner with Rusty Rose and Tom Schieffer -- who
   was the responsible party. So, when the governor
   says The Ballpark project is an example of his
   business acumen, he is speaking the truth. No amount
   of spin or retelling the tale by ballpark
   adversaries is going to change that."

Some "lousy businessman", eh?

Strike two.  I live in Texas, I know better.

Check out the actual results of national testing, Ed:
http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/states/profile.asp?state=TX&submit=Go

Gosh, Texas scores went *up*.  I regret to inform you
that your Democrat propagandists have been lying to you.

Not only were national test scores up, but so were the
statewide TAAS test results, and dropout rates declined
significantly, and minority test scores were especially
improved:

http://www.educationreview.homestead.com/TexasMiracle.html

And from www.negp.gov, the federal National Education
Goals Panel report for 1999 (under Clinton, I might add)
Texas was ranked "Highest Performing" on 4 measures of
progress, "Most Improved" in 2 measures, and demonstrated
12 "Areas of Improvement".  Under the "Areas of Decline"
category, it said simply, "There are no measures of progress
where Texasï¿½ performance has declined."

Ed, the Democrats cynically lied to you, and you swallowed
it.  Check out:

> and the state achieved the dubious honor of "most
>polluted state in the United States".

Ah, that happy horseshit...   Strike three, Ed.

And you can't even get the Democrats' propaganda right,
it's that *Houston* was the "most polluted city in
the country".  Even the Democrats couldn't stretch
the data far enough to claim all of Texas as #1,
so they never actually said that it was
(But they wanted to leave the *impression* that
Texas as a whole was poisoned by Bush, and you
swallowed it hook, line, and sinker.)

So how did they manage to claim that Houston was #1
in air pollution?  By being dishonest, of course.

Gore issued a 10/8/00 press release which tried to smear
Bush as a poisoner of the air by insinuating that
Houston was the most polluted city in the country.
However, as Clinton would say, that depends on
the meaning of the word "most".

It's true that in 2000 Houston had more "bad ozone"
days than any other major city -- these are the
number of days in the year when the ozone level
has, at some point during the day, exceeded the
level that the EPA sets as "acceptable".

But if you read the fine print in Gore's "most
polluted blah blah blah" press release, you'll
see that they carefully admit (knowing that the
press would overlook the qualifier) that they
were only referring to *ozone*:

   "October is the final month of the smog season 
   and Houston is ahead of Los Angeles with 42 
   unhealthy air days compared to 39 for Los Angeles,
   which was No. 1 for decades with unhealthy air days
   as indicated by the amount of ozone," 

But the bigger print in the press release tried
to give a more general impression:

   "Air quality officials will gladly concede the nation's
   smoggiest city title to Houston, which is poised to
   take the dishonor for a second consecutive year," 

Now wait a minute, was Houston actually the "nation's
smoggiest city", period?  Hell no.

Air pollution reports cover far, far more than just ozone.
And while ozone (a three-atom form of oxygen) can be
irritating, causing irritated throats in high concentrations,
it's the most benign of all the substances the EPA tracks
for air pollution.  That list includes Carbon Monoxide,
Nitrogen Dioxide, Lead, Particulate Matter, and Sulfur Dioxide,
all of which are more health-threatening than ozone.

So how did Houston fare in *those* categories?  Very
clean, as a matter of fact, thank you for asking.  Houston
just sometimes gets ozone peaks because we have a shitload
of cars on the road.  (And as an interesting sidebar,
most of Houston's ozone quickly blows out into the Gulf
of Mexico, it doesn't stay and stagnate -- or wash over
some other city -- as is the case for other high-ozone
metropolises.)

In *overall* pollution, not just the "ozone champ" category --
you know, the stuff that can actually poison people --
Houston had a clean bill of health.  Gore "forgot" to
mention that.

Al Gore's own Knoxville, Tennessee had 62 days in the
year when the air was "unacceptable".  Houston only had
54.  And Knoxville's violations were for the hardier,
smellier, more health-threatening chemicals, not the
ozone that made up Houston's violations.

What was the actual #1 city for 2000 overall air violations,
according to the Clinton-Gore EPA?   The Riverside-San Bernadino,
California, area topped the list, with 97 days where air quality
was rated unhealthy -- 80% more than Houston.  And the amount
of violation (i.e., how far the standards were exceeded on those
days) were higher on average than for Houston's "bad" days
as well.

So which city is really the #1 US air pollution champ?

Ed, do you believe every lie the Democrats tell you?


>George W. "Forrest Gump" Bush.

All three of your "stick to the facts" were wrong, Ed.
Three strikes and you're out, Ed "Whiffle Ball" Jensen.

Now would you like to admit that you've been
dishonestly mislead by the media, or are you going to
stick to your position even though your "facts" are
actually exposed as empty propaganda?
