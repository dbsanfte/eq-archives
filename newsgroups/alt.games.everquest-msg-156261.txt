I was just wondering if the LvL cap for Bind Wounds was raised recently?

I am a druid and was Kiting in GD last night when I found myself OOM &
almost dead, so after fight I started to Bind Wounds and noticed I got a
point in it and now my bind wounds is 201, I was told & I also read that
everyone's BW was capped at 200  or Lower even after LvL 51 except Monks &
Rogues.
