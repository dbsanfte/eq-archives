Yes, there are a few quick quests you can do to improve your faction
with the various residents of Neriak.

In the Neriak Third Gate zone, in the library, there is an NPC
named Lokar To'Biath.  Give him Red Wine to raise faction with the
merchants and guards.  Red Wine can be purchased at most any tavern.

In the Neriak Commons zone, give Rat Whiskers to the Exterminator
(I forget his name) to raise faction with merchants, guards, and
the Warrior guild.  You can get Rat Whiskers by killing rats, or
by browsing through merchants in hopes that someone else sold
them some Whiskers.  Concentrate on merchants in or near newbie
zones that have rats.

Depending on how badly you screwed your faction, though, it might
take dozens or even hundreds of these quests to fix.  If your
character is fairly low level, say less than 5, it might be easier
just to make a new character.
