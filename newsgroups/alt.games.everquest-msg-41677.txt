Unfortunately what has happened is the United States of America, of which i am
member of, and proud to live here, even if I don't always agree with government
policies, put both Saddam and the Taliban into power by "supporting Freedom
Fighters".  Esp with the Taliban, they were the people the us backed in ousting
the old government that was allowing the Soviet Union to move communism in etc. 
Our policies of "Freedom and Good" meddling in other countries governments, etc,
have caused us more problems than it's worth.  We put Saddam in power and
bolstered his military because we disaggreed with Iran.  We put noriega in
charge of Panama, we put the Taliban in charge of Afghanistan.  I don't think we
deserved what happened, but frankly if we didn't try to make everyone share our
views all the time and practiced a more isolationist world policy, We probably
wouldn't be viewed so poorly by other nations.  I also think that if we are
careful in how we deal with this we can possibly get a coalition to eliminate
bin Laden much like we did when Saddam invaded kuwait.  I agree we need to do
something to punish those responsible for this attack, however all these "bomb
the fuck out of them" rants don't do much to show the World that America is not
the "Great Satan".  No matter what we do to bin Laden he will be replaced within
a few hours by someone just like him.  Great Britain and her allies in World War
II helped to establish Israel, which is in fact the homeland of the "nation of
israel" mentioned in the bible.  The only problem with that was there were other
decendants of the original people there, who didn't practice Judaism anymore. 
My personal feeling on the middle east is the people there have been fighting
over the same god, worshipped in different ways for thousands of years.  No
matter what the US does by trying to support ANY of the involved parties, not
just israel, isn't gonna make a bit of difference.  If these people want to kill
each other, by all means let them.  Why should we be involved, or better yet,
why just back one side.  We are after all a nation of capitalists, lets sell
arms to both sides.  Maybe if they both kill each other off, we won't have to
worry about them any more.

What happened is a horrible tragedy that will continue to affect the rest of the
world for some time.  I feel we need to take some action against those
responsible.  Personally I think killing them will just server to Martyr them. 
I would rather see them kept in prison forever.  I am not talking some country
club either.  I mean a hard lockdown where if he (bin laden is the leading
suspect) spouts the crap he has been, people will seriously fuck his shit up. 
he won't be seen as a Martyr to his followers etc.  Keep him in prison so that
he can die at his own hand or of old age, possibly make him watch tapes of
witnesses etc over and over again, but keep him alive so that he can't "die for
islam" and won't be guaraneed his place in heavan.
