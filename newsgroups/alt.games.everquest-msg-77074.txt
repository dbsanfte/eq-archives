imho, enchanters are not the most challenging class... one of the easiest.
have a 60 chanter... very easy stuff. ppl adds, i clear my target, i ae
stun, the mob that hits me is the one thats is not on puller, hit mez. stand
up a little while longer and re-mez.  click snake on ppl for haste, give out
c2.  you want a challenge, play a bard in the role of a chanter.  chanters
dont really come into their own till 40+ imo. mostly because crowd control
is our main purpose... since most common hunting grounds till 40+ are
outside, adds are not too common... even if you do get adds, all the noobs
just break mez anyhow.
