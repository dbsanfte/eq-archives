Lucy.  Now part of Allakhazam's at http://lucy.allakhazam.com/ 
It's a database of parsed files on the EQ client and data gathered by players
running a data-capture program (not showeq or anything like it, no cheating
involved).

For instance, Desolate Deeds shows "increase disease counter by 24", so 6
casts of the low-level "cure disease" or one cast of "abolish disease" is
needed.  

It doesn't show some things though, and some things aren't curable at all
using "cure" spells, but require dispell magic or AAs like radiant cure.

>What cures malo? cure desease, poison or magic?

Time.  Or Radiant cure.  Dispelling magic enough times will get it, but then
you're buffless.


>What cures Tash? is it only AA's RC's or RGC or Cure desease?

Poison.  One counter for all tash spells.

>What cures Chaos claws?

Poison.  9 counters.
