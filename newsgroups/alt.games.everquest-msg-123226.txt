So far, other than pure faction or xp quests, I have done two quests that
yielded items that were very much worth the effort.  Testament of Vanear,
and Shield of Bane Warding.  Well, add in a few key quests too to get into
some nifty zones.  As a ranger, I'm not quite sure about what quests yield a
really worthwhile item to you at your level.
