Right-click on the chat screen, and one of the options is to open another
chat window.  You can have several chat windows open.  So, get a couple
windows open, and then right click again on one of them, and you'll find an
option there to set filters or something like that (I forget the exact
command name).  That will give you a dialog to control what goes to that
window.

When you set something for a given window, it stops going to the other
windows, so you can make a new window for messages to you and battle info,
and set it for those, and they will stop going to the original window.

One nice touch: when you change the settings for a chat window, it is
retroactive.  E.g., if you make a new window and set it for tells to you,
all tells to you from your other windows get moved to that window, so it is
basically like you had set it up that way from the beginning.

Note that if you close one of these windows, it is like most other
windows--it still logically exists, but you simply do not see it.  So, if
you close your "tells and battle info" window, that data will NOT start
showing up in the other window.  If you aren't careful, you could have an
important category of chat going somewhere you can't see.
