Makes you think that if they made the next expansion JUST bug fixes, quest
solutions, recipe formulas and they could probably double the content.

Also, fixing some of those old armor quests to make the stuff worth questing
again.  My toon was in Scarlet Desert and finding items for the Twilight Sea
Armor quests.  Looking up some of that stuff and I had to laugh how
pointless it was to do the quests.  In fact, most of the quest items in the
lower end of the game (lvl 50 and below) are so much junk.

While their at it, change the prices of the vendor bought armor and weapons,
simply changing the prices from plat to gold or even silver and the new
players would actually buy some of that stuff.  There is still the old Light
Healing potion available for 10pp.  Its so dumb to have all those merchants
and not have anything worth buying.

Also, they should add Hint Sheets to drops.  Give you short cuts on quests,
recipes, mob tactics.

Example:
Quest:  Allow you to skip a step in an Epic quest.
Recipe: Allow you an extra 10% success rate on one recipe
Mob Tactic: Allow you an extra 10% damage rate on a type of mob, lions,
skeletons, fish, etc.

Then limit the number of hints in each category that you can learn.
