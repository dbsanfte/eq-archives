Yeah, in a way. The hybrid had a 40 percent xp penalty, so it got a 40
percent larger share of the xp the group was getting or something. So
with a hybrid you did not level way slower than the buddies you
grouped with, but they'd level a bit slower than if they just grabbed
a warrior. 

It was something they never really thought out when they gave them a
40 percent minus on their xp table. If they then did not give them an
extra group share, you'd have a hybrid who always grouped with friends
who also only grouped with him yet the friends would be level 35 while
the hybrid was level like level 21. So in a way, everyone got
penalized as long as the hybrid was grouping while if the hybrid
soloed only he got penalized.

They did not explain this fully, either. Likely they knew it would
cause people to not want to group with hybrids. Instead players
gradually figured it out by comparing an xp group with a hybrid
to one with a regular tank. A lot of us did not really care though,
the group did not really level THAT much slower.

The fix, since they long claimed they could not change the xp
table(which is where the hybrid  -40 percent was), was to simply make
it so the hybrid still gets 40 percent more xp but that xp comes from
thin air instead of the share of the groups xp. This was done by
making the hybrid's share multiplied by 1.4 whether it was grouping or
soloing (effectively eliminating the 40 percent difference.)

It all started because of the assumption that hybrids were far better
than a regular warrior otherwise, back when the levels ended at 50 and
there were no AA. They really were better for the most part back then,
since a warrior would not be any more tanky than a hybrid. They got
wise when they upped the level limit to 60, giving the warrior more
melee power, adding AA eventually and doing other stuff that now made
a 40 percent penalty for hybrids moot when the warrior became super
tank and the rogue super duper insane damage dealer.

No, that never happened(unless it was some very short lived bug.) I
played a bard way early and heal only healed me. I think the bug was
the mana song or whatever BENEFICIAL songs helped other players
outside the group in the area. They did nothing to monsters unless
they were a damage/debuff song. So players would hang around a bard
some even if the bard was soloing ;)  Last time I played the area
effect bard mana songs still worked on people outside the group.
