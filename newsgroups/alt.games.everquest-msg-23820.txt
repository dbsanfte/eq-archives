I always enjoyed the Earthsea triliogy by Ursula K LeGuinn. 
There were one or two added after the original three, but
they weren't nearly as good in my opinion.

Fritz Leiber's books about Llankhmar, which feature Fafhard
and Greymouser were some I also enjoyed, but I have talked
with others who never cared for them.

Possibly out of print, slightly more adult themed, and
sometimes offensive to people was the Gor series by John
Norman.  I believe the first was Tarnsman of Gor.
A search on amazon.com looks like they started reprinting
these January of this year.

Not quite Swords and Sorcery but with some amazing EQ
parallels is Cavern of Socrates by Dennis McKiernan.
