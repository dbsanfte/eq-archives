Just  hit 40 with my halfling druid, and he's never once been in a group
(not that I'm antisocial ... just wanted to see if it could be done <g>).
From 35 to 37 or so I quadded (well, tripled) the crazed gobs in
Butcherblock.  When they played out, I went to FV and quadded drolvargs
until 39, then moved over to the Forest Giants ... less dangerous, and
there's always the possibility of that rare Forest Loop.  Now at 40 I'm
quadding spirocs in Tim Deep, which can be dangerous as anything ... those
macaws can backstrab for 300 a pop! :-)

Hope this helps!
