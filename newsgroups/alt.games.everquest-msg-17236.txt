lol that sounds like me, i think that i save and loot save and loot
but i never seems to get any money, i wan't to buy a new staff but
i haven't found one for sale, it will cost around 300pp

I deleted my shadow knight last night and gave an almost full suit of
leather armour to a lvl 2 guy(sk) felt good since he had only the
thing you get when signing in, money i will not give, mostly because
i don't have that much and i prefer to save for my spells and book of
darkbinding.
