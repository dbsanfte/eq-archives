Oddly enough, that's one of my favorite memories in all of Everquest. I 
was playing my first "main" who was a human monk out of Qeynos. My wife 
had started an alt for the first time, a dwarven cleric. Remember, this 
was back in early 2000 I guess, long before spires or PoK books and 
there was no shared bank.

We had some piece of priceless treasure.. (it was probably a piece of 
player made fine steel armor) which we wanted to "twink" the new cleric 
with. With great trepidation, I stripped my monk naked (I was too low 
level for feign death) and deposited the precious item in the bank, and 
began the run. I ran, unbuffed and clueless, from Qeynos to the dwarven 
city, including the frightening boat ride. (I'd never done it before, 
and it was exciting as all hell.) I crouched my way into the dwarven 
bank, gave the cleric the item, and used the "suicide port" back home by 
attacking one of the guards.

I don't know why you brought that to mind just now, but that might 
possibly have been the most fun I ever had in Everquest.
