I think it -was- good, and assume that 75% of the people here don't
read replies down deep in  a thread.  Most of the time, that doen't
make my deathless prose worth exerpting, but here, I was staring
at an aside paragraph that I thought worthy of its own thread.

Just goes to show you the power of the asinine throwaway line...

It was, I assure you, a joke, not meant to denigrate anyone but
the people who don't think Bill Mahr is funny.

Euros' don't drive on either side of the road, since those Limey
bastiches are technically European just as are the Frogs across
the channel.  They've formed a single country, a collective
of states (see also United States of America, Estados Unidos
du Brasil, et al) yet they haven't hashed out simple details like
which side of the road to drive on.

If (and I say if) we all trained left and med right, we'd have
a perfectly workable situation.  Bloody Aussies wouldn't
have much punch to it.  Then again, they'd probably
(warning, obligatory anti-Oz dig) zone back across the
same side they came in on.

Should I remake the post (third time I'd be putting up this
slice of cut and paste) without the joke at the end in the
hopes that the central point could be discussed instead
of my "oops, went over your head" little dig?
