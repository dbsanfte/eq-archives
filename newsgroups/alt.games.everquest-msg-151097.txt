Give me the 'priests are balanced' song and dance and I'll charm a
velium hound and sic it on you :p Yes, it is an upgrade, but it isn't
anywhere near balancing, nor are the PoP spells. It just means:
1. Nature's Touch gets relegated to the back of my spellbook as I
almost didn't buy it in the first place and have only used it for slow
bulk healing
2. I am very glad I never put any AA into healing stuff
3. I am still debating respec'ing from Alteration to Evocation
