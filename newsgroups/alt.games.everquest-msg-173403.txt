Yep.  American Democrats still beat that drum from time to time, but
independent recounts by various media organizations showed that Bush would
have beaten Gore even if the Florida State Supreme Court's ruling had not

sufferred in November last year, largely because of Bush's efforts and
popularity, did much to silence the left's claim that Bush has no mandate
from the people.
