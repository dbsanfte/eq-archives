There is a cap on how much xp you can get from a single kill, but
the cap is fairly big; something like half a yellow bubble.  It's
not anything you'd have to worry about in a normal situation.

The cap is there to prevent extreme powerleveling -- getting a 50th
level mob down to 10 hit points and memblurring/atoning it, then
having your 1st level twink necro lifetap it for the remaining 10
hits and gaining a dozen levels immediately.

Like I said, it's not anything to worry about in anything resembling
a normal grouping situation.
