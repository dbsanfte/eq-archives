You're level 27, so in not too many more levels it will start to change
for you. The post 30 game begins to get interesting in terms of some
occasional loot that's pretty valuable.  The post 40 game, much more so. I
didn't have 5K in the bank until after I hit 40.  Hang in there and keep
moving up to harder and harder zones as you're able. The plat will come.
