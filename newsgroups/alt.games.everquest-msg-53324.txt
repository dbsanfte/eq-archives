Don't get discouraged...the ones that jump levels play 12-24 hours a day and
don't have a life!  I have found a paladin levels nicely and can solo on
their own pretty well.  The first 8 lvls are tough until you get healing
spells, but if you start using bandage skills right away, you can usually
fight at half health most of the time.  Get a good amount of hit points too.
Not sure where you've fought, but my usual exp route is..local area till
about 4-5, then just outside local area till about 7.  I then move to west
commons where exp is good, loot is good (wisps, tons of wisps), and most
folks are willing to help if you help in return.  At about 12, I hit oasis
until about 17-18, the head off to lake of ill omen.  There you can get to
30 or so solo (I did with a previous paladin), and even find good groups to
tank for if you seek company.  30-35 hit frontier mountains and overthere,
and once 35 or so, head to velious and don't look back until about 45+.
Can't help you past that, as never been higher than 46 (which I made in
velious).  Been playing since the beginning and have been a 29 cleric, 39
cleric, 34 enchanter, 14 wizard, 46 paladin, 24 cleric, 23 paladin, and
currently a 17 cleric.  All I have left is the 17 cleric and 23 paladin and
the cleric is currently my main.  When I get tired of the support role, I
swap equipment and play the paladin and vice versa....oh yeah, almost forgot
I had a 34 druid in there somewhere, but still went back to the
paladin/cleric  (guess I'm just a do gooder at heart)....be safe and see you
Lake of Ill Omen (if on Drinal).....
