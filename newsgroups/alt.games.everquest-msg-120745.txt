I'll need a patch to fix my problem.
I play at 800x600 res,on the clear window view.Since this patch,my spell
casting icons wich are usually on the left hand side of screen,no longer are
visible.I don't use Tex.caching,but i did go ahead and delete the TXC file.
Still no icons.I can see the icons if i play in tunnel view,but don't like
it.
