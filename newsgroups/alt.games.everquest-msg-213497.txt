Cant speak to the Mage rain spells but for the druid rain spells,
specifically the level 61 Rain, Winters Storm, is a devestating Nuke when
grouped. As long as the tank has good aggro ( pallies are wonderfull for
this )  winters storm can be a quick 2550 pts of damage for 500 mana if all
3 waves land.  In my experience the waves are only slightly more resisted
than our other normal spells, and LESS resisted than our roots that have a
damage component to them.

( On a side note you have NO Idea how happy this druid was once Savage Roots
was scribed in the books!! Long lasting, and FAR less resisted than any of
our other Long lasting roots )
