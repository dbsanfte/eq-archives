Most rogues just throw it in with the other skills they have to raise 
anyway :p  I have two hotkeys set up.  One without PP (I replace it with 
evade).  One with PP.  If I get into a group where one or two people are 
looting before the corpse hits the floor, I just PP until I get 
something off the mob.  Weird thing, though.  Some mobs tattle, others 
don't.  It's weird.

Well, I've heard tell you USED to be able to PP the fungi ... ;)

Fear kite?  That's what amused me about the third comment I listed - 
before the second rogue came along, we were doing quite well.  When he 
came in he insisted it'd never work.  It took about 2 mobs for him to 
change his mind. ;p  The only REALLY annoying thing about fear is the 
directional change when DD is done.  I don't get as many BSs in as I 
would in a regular group.
