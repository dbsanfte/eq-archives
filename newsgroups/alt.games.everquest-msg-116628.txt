Wow.  That is one difficult-to-read article.  And I've got to say I'm
disappointed.  He grudgingly mentions EQ's positive effects (in that it's a
social game), but his third paragraph overshadowed all that, and the
"positives" are clearly intended as little more than a nudge and a wink
mickey-take.  "EverQuest offers families a way of staying together by
slaying together" pretty much says it all, I think.

And quite why this single case of a depressed youth committing suicide had
to be included in the article I don't know.  The link with EQ was tenuous at
best.  Yes, EverQuest players commit suicide sometimes.  So do tennis
players, golf players, musicians and mime artists.  But because it's a
computer game, and everyone knows computer games are the stuff of the Devil,
the suicide has to be blamed on EQ, rather than the depression itself or any
one of a million other possible causes.  And that's before you consider that
the condition of depression usually renders rational analysis impossible in
any case.  Shaun Woolley's mother plans to sue Sony because that's the
mentality of the world we live in.  A tragedy must always be followed by a
lawsuit.  Someone has to be sued, for something - anything.  Never mind the
fact that all entertainment products in every genre and medium are designed
to be as "addictive as possible", Mrs Woolley's got an attorney in - and
that attorney is going to do everything he can to put a set-figure price on
her son's life.

I'll stop before this turns into an anti-lawsuit rant (or at least more than
it is).  I don't expect any article except an advert to unconditionally
expound the sheer delight of the game - it has its faults and it causes its
problems.  I just think it's cheap and lazy journalism to run to the
reliable old bogeyman of video games simply because you can't be bothered to
do any proper research.
