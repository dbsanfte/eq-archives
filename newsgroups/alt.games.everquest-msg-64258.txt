I got mine at noon cst.  Didn't bother to install it until 3:00PM
cst.  Still haven't tried to log in, knew it would never be up and
running on time. I don't know anything about programming and other
computer related stuff, but as a line-tech in a huge spice plant I
know that any tim engineers design a new line and the mechanics put
it together it takes about 2 days (4 - 8 hour shifts) or close to
that to get the line running the way it should (smoothly with no
more than average down-time).  I figure I will try it in about 3
more hours.  It may be going by then.  But I honestly expect late
tonight early tomorrow for the emergency patches to be done
(mostly).
