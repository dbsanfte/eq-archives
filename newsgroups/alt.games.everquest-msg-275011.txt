Ah, that's right, forgot about Hogger in Westfall. However, most
classes can solo him just 2 or 3 levels above him. The quests that
have you kill single elite mobs are actually quite soloable, just it's
going to be a harder fight. Like I said, it's the instanced quests
that are really not reasonably soloable.
