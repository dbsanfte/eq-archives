I went onto the blizzard website and poked around to see if they had
any recent "x million players" announcements and didn't see any, but
that doesn't prove anything one way or the other.

As far as BC, this is the first I've heard about the new stuff being a
grind.  I suppose it's how you treat it... I've really enjoyed the
ride from 60 to 70, but I'm also not too worried about having to build
up X reputation with group Y to get item Z, so I don't see much of the
grind part.
