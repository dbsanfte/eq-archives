Unless both machines are the exact same except for the OS, I wouldn't blame
XP professional.  I use it on 3 of my computers, and haven't had any
problems that I could attribute to it (many problems I could attribute to
other stuff, though).  The machine running professional may have driver
issues (graphics, sound, chipset (VIA causes some big problems if you don't
have the latest version, btw).  Or even your install of professional might
have been currupted.  I'm pretty sure if you put the windows xp cd back into
your cdrom, one of the options is 'repair' or something similar, maybe you
can run through some of the utilities and make sure you don't have any
currupt files.  Just some thoughts.
