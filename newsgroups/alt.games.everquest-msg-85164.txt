   Heh.  There was a discussion about this in EFP 
/ooc about 2 or 3am this morning.  I'm getting
some serious sense of deja vu right about now, I
tell you what.
   Yeah, Bait's name sounds like a historical
figure's.  Verant is run by a bunch of hypocrites.
Because of Mr. Masterson's existence, you 
should be able to name yourself Leser Maddox.
   You've won the thread.  Please step forward
to claim your prize.

           Maddox, btw.
