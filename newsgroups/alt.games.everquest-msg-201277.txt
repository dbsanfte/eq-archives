He certainly has all the signs of a person with a sick mind.  Writing
a series of books with so many characters on so many worlds was an
evil thing to do to the reader - even with the time line and cast of
characters in the back of each book, it was extremely difficult to
keep track of what the hell was going on.

BTW, there is no significance to me choosing the most evil character
in the book as an avatar name.  I had to think of a name in a hurry,
and Banneth was the first thing in my head.  In retrospect, perhaps he
should have been a shadow knight rather than a bard.

Banneth on Bristlebane
