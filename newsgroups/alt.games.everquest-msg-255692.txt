Better to measure success by house, but not nearly as easy to describe.  =)

Very, very, very few are solo, and even more rarely are the solo ones very
successful.

I have never once met a "successful" (in comparison to his peers)
consultant.  I'm sure there must be exceptions, but for the most part you
either sacrifice some freedom or you sacrifice some pay.  I've never even
heard of a solo financial planner existing.  =)

I was referencing movie stars, singers, etc.  Even most sports superstars
don't qualify as solo.

And that is an argument against what I said how?  If you're trying to
compare that to an EQ group, we can only be thankful that EQ is a little bit
more egalitarian.

My personal definition of success probably only applies to me, and I'm not
there yet.  But I accept that I have to give up some personal freedom and be
a part of "something bigger" to have a hope of achieving that success.
