Swarm kiting is great fun and very fast xp.  The downside to that is if
we ever have to melee we're spanked unless you take a break every level
or 3 to work on melee skills.  I won't go into details of the kiting
process as other already did, if you want to learn more on bards, try
www.eqdiva.com or www.dotnetdiva.com

Sadly yes, you are (as were all my other toons) inadequate to handle
this volume of mobs solo, but tanks excel in many other areas.  I
created a bard as I mainly solo and play at off times, works well.
