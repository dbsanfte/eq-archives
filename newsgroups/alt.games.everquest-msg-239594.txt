are you aware of what the word "ignorance" means?  it means you do something
you are not supposed to, not because you want to go against the grain, but
simply because you don't know that it is wrong.  a baby touching a stove is
ignorant because the baby does not know that a stove is hot, and therefore
should not be touched.  how, then, is someone ignorant when they know what
they're doing is wrong and they do it anyway?  i think that you are ignorant
because you do not realize that literary art is still an art, not only in
its "story telling," but also in its visual appearance.  it is therefore an
art technique to capitalize only when putting emphasis on a word or phrase.
it is in the aesthetics of one's everyday writing that their true artistic
nature and creativity in the literary arts is revealed.  this is the reason
that a poet will arrange his words on the page in a way that is both
appealing to the eye, and also gives more meaning to the poem.  so, while
you find my capitalization techniques unpleasing, i find the way most of the
people here write to be stereotypical, bland, lacking in imagination and
skill, ordinary, and furthermore boring.  although, as an artist, all i wish
is for people to look at and acknowledge my work, whether their opinion be
that it is wonderful or that it is utterly atrocious.

also, why the hell is everyone so focused on everyone else's gramer?
