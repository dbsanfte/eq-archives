It is a different EXE file in the main EQ directory
(testeverquest.exe). 

When you run the EXE, the patcher downloads the files that are
newer/different on the test server. The next time you run the regular
EXE, the files will be replaced with the correct ones for normal
servers. If you hop between regular and test a lot, then it is highly
recommended that you copy your entire EQ folder to a second location.
(assuming you have enough HDD space) That way you won't have to keep
repatching all the time.
