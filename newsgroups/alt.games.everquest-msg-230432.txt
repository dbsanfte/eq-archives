I've concluded that it isn't. I am about to get a 36% worn haste item via
LDoN points, and I can cast a 50% slow for which the mana cost is pretty
trivial. And besides, that slow is irrelevant anytime I'm in a group that
includes a shaman, chanter or a necro if we're hunting undead -- I am the
slower no more than 1/3 the time, and 5% better slow wouldn't change that.

So the epic effects are a bit better than what I have without it, but only a
bit -- not enough to make the time and effort of doing the epic really
worthwhile.
