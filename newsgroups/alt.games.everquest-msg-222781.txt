And how much effort/time was WASTED on this nonsense? How many bugs went
unfixed while this was added.... /boggle

Damn! Was hoping against hope they'd start new chars with 200K plat in
the bank, now I have to wait for another patch to start creating chars!

They also forgot Fiskar Handholder, the NPC that runs you to level 50
