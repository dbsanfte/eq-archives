Well that's a lot of HP compared to my puny DE warrior but damn! His armour
must of sucked, what was he wearing? Crafted and swinging Yaks?

These weapons have names?
What, Droppable, 1hder has 22/28 stats and is usable by a DW class other
than a Bard? Closest I can think of to those stats is the Longsword of
Freedom but as that is No Drop it isn't that.

Just so you know, standing toe2toe with a mob only Monks and Rangers
outdamage Warriors. If you out put out more damage and mitigated damage
better it was due to him having sub standard equipment...VERY Sub standard
equipment.

You want to play with a Rogue as tank, you do that...I don't care, I never
liked the roles enforced on characters in EQ anyway...You just push the
boundaries of disbelief with your story of out tanking a 55 Warrior and
wielding a 22/28 weapon, once it comes up for sale.
