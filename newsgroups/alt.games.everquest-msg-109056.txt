1. Collect runes and you will get plenty. buy rare ones if necessary or buy
the completed spells use bank boxes - it gets confusing. the runes stack.
also they will turn up in mobs
2. I never did the practice thing and my research is like 142.
3. Research ends at level 49 - you will likely buy ice comet before you make
it.
4. Most wizzie spells you research will end up not used - lev and ice comet
exceptions.
5. These may be bought in kitty city --- not sure - - Have heard yes for
chanter research spells.
6. Sometimes you will get these spells for free - if in guild with 50s etc
and sometimes you will have to pay 1k --- Ice comet is worth 1k. rend is
purchased if necessary to compensate.
7. Your research skill will come up fast and yes you will blow a few
precious runes. oh well.
8. I have only been turned down one time for runes or pages - so when you
join a group announce you are looking for the runes - - - some MLs actually
destroy them - all will help resaerch
9. Have fun a nice part of the game.
