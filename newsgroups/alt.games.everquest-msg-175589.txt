Being as I often group without an enchanter it falls on me to handle the
haste.  Sure, if there is an enchanter, barring a complete lack of mana, the
enchanter casts the haste.  I guess next time I play I will just have to
inform them how crappy it is, and that I thus won't be casting it, I mean,
what use is 50% haste for a mere 16 minutes?  I am sure I will last long in
that group, and gain a reputation as a great shaman to have along in a
group.
