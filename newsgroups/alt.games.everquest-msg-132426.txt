What -really- works well, is both.  Of course, then I'm just there to c2 
the druid, mostly.

It's good in theory, but has some major drawbacks.  Like that mem blur is 
annoying in that it works maybe 40-50% of the time, and you can't always 
tell if it worked.  Usually, when I PL, I prefer to copy the druid 
technique.  Feedback, Haste, and Berz Str for heal.

Depends a lot on the situation, though.
