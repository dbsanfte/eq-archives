I just got a third line installed into my house so I can play my two
accounts at once on the second and third lines.  In about 2 weeks I am
getting a one way cable modem.  It downloads from 1.5-3meg a second, and
uses my modem to upload.  I was wondering how these work, so if anyone uses
one of these I would very much appreciate your views on it.  I love playing,
but the lag kills me.  I wish I could get two way modem, but one way is all
that is available in my area, but I'll get a free upgrade to two way when
they get it, at least.

Thanks for any replies,
