Any

In your EQ folder, find the text file entitled "UIErrors" and open it (it
will open with the default text editor, usually Notepad). This will list the
dates and times of the particular errors with your custom UI, along with the
particular element that the game was looking for, and the window (xml file)
that is the culprit.

Now you have 2 choices:

a) you can ignore the warnings (likely without any drawbacks, but that
depends on your particular UI) and just continue to recieve them.

OR

b) you can replace the culprit window in your custom UI file with a copy
from the default UI file (or just delete it from the custom file, as the
game should search the default file for the window in question), which
should stop the spamming of the error message.

Likely, your problem is similar to mine: I use a custom group window that
was created before the LFG button was added to that xml file, and since the
game can't locate that part of the xml file, it deems that window
"incompatible". There is no other drawback, if you want to call it that,
other than the fact that I do not have the LFG button on my group window...
it still works perfectly well in every other aspect, and I can still use the
LFG tool (just not that button). It's really just a matter of whether or not
you want to get rid of the error messages (at the expense of loosing your
custom UI until it's updated)...
