I only recently stopped carrying two extra pairs of pants and a tunic
around (only carry one pair of pants). I carry with me, in my bags, a
shield and an earring for tradeskilling; a stein for shopping; a
necklace, an earring, two rings, three bracers, a mask, a pair of
leggings and a pair of pants as resist gear, a mushy old fire beetle
eye, some peridots, fish scales, batwings, fishing pole, food and
water, pickled drake for tradeskilling, wild cabbages for luck, white
chocolate cookies for giving away, and the odd tradeskill or quest
piece. I also have a fletching kit, a coldain tanner's kit, and a
mortar and pestle.

There's a bloody good reason resists are the first thing I look at
when considering upgrades nowadays.
