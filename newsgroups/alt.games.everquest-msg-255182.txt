I recently bought the Radeon 9800 Pro 128MB version and have been pleased 
with it. CoH looked just *incredible* compared to other lesser cards I 
saw it run on.

It does bother me a bit to see the nVidia logo on practically every game 
I pick up, though (EQ included). At the time, the ATI was the best card 
for the money, IMO, and it doesn't necessarily seem to fall short in any 
of those same games.
