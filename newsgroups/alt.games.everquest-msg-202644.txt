Flags are not an object that you would turn in.  I would expect that 
completing flags post change will not add AAXP, although they may well 
raise the effects of the charm slot item.  They did state that the 
flagging mechanisms will still exist, this is what will allow a character 
too low for one of the zones to enter regardless.  I guess we will know 
soon exactly how it is going to work.
