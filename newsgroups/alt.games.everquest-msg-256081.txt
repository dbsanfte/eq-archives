As a 65 cleric having done hundreds of LDON's, I always bind at the local
camp soulbinder before a mission.... and in the event of a wipe or death of
myself, the groups are forever grateful I do it.  I've even had a few
private tells saying "thanks for binding near camp, I wish more clerics did
it" etc
Imagine my horror once when upon completing a Hard Guk LDON I cast gate and
ended up at my previous bind point just outside the entrance to Seb!!  It
appears that I must have mis-spelt the bind my soul message or somesuch.
Freaky!! Glad I didn't die on that mission!!
