Dan, I agree. Parts of the book AND the movie were boring! What I DID like
was seeing how much EQ has taken from it! (besides Legolas, which we won't
go into here again, I think everyone in the NG knows what I feel about THAT)
It's been so long since I read the series (and I read it from Hobbit to the
end) that I had *forgotten* how close, in some instances the book actually
IS to EQ. I think Gandaalf was a p*ss poor wizzie, for instance, but since I
haven't read the book in 20 years and don't recall, maybe Tolkien wrote him
that way! (comments anyone?)
