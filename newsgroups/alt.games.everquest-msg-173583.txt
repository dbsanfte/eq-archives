Will you be at tomorrow's raid?  Maybe?  Will PlayerA?  Yes.
Will you be at Saturday's raid?  Maybe?  Will PlayerA?  Yes.
Will you be at Sunday's raid?  Maybe?  Will PlayerA?  Yes.

Am I calling you undependable?  Yes.

I'm not saying it as an insult.  Some people have busier lives or stranger
work schedules, etc.  It doesn't change the fact that yes, you are in fact
undependable.

When it comes to loot there are no easy answers.  The best you can hope for
is to be fair.

Open raids are a whole nother story.  I still play my sub-53 characters for
Naggy/Vox raids sometimes, purely for the fun of it.  I enjoy it *because*
of the utter chaos and predictable loot squabbles.  :)

There are raids that fall into that category, no doubt.  Gearing up is an
important aspect of the high end game.

I agree with you, to a point.  You're not dealing with the realities of the
game though.  Mobs have multiple drops.  Sometimes you kill a mob that has 5
possible drops and he drops two of the one that really sucks.  Sometimes you
do that 9 raids in a row.  :)  So when you show up on the *one* time that
the item drops that the other guy has been trying for 9 raids previously,
why shouldn't he get it first?

That's a system I've seen used before.  Painfully annoying to me, but if you
can talk a guild into using it, it has some merit.
