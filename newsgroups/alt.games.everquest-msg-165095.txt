My cleric is finally getting up there in levels (not uber high yet, but the
highest level character I own, so seems high to me) and my 1hb skill is 69
right now.  My other melee skills are below 10 I think and can't remember
what my offense skill is.

My question is, in the endgame HOW necessary is melee for a cleric?  I keep
reading about the damage output possible at that end (54+) and I'm wondering
if I am totally screwing myself by doing the typical sit, stand, cast, sit
cycle.  If so is there another way to practice the skill aside from meleeing
in a group?  I always feel like I'm wasting my group's time if I do that
since it means a bit more downtime for medding back up.  I do pickup groups
mostly, though there is a 51 Ranger I have been grouping with almost
constantly.  I know I can't skillup on greens (or can I?) but are there any
mobs that you would know of that would be light blue to me at this level and
not waste me if I were to try and melee them?  I've thought about trying to
fight things near a zone line, basically run in and melee till I'm in a
danger spot on health and run and zone, go heal, come back and repeat
hopefully getting skillups along the way.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  I want to be the best cleric I can
be, so don't want to be slacking on something that will hurt me and my guild
in the endgame.
