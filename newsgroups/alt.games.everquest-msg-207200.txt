Constant pulls, no mana regen spell on me.  It's a 10% difference in 
haste for the added benefit of much less casting time than hasting 4 
people individually, and 75% of the mana to haste them individually.  
Giving one person more haste would mean the mana cost is now the same as 
the group haste.  The MA, a shadowknight, had zero problems holding agro.  
I also had to keep myself with a fair amount of mana handy, our cleric 
was having connectivity problems, and I had to take over as healer for a 
while a couple of times.
