	In a more perfect world, any Ranger raising Kromrif/Kromzek faction would
lose his spellcasting ability, or at least go KOS to his home factions.

	Those guys are at war with Tunare.  If you're a Ranger, Tunare is either
your goddess, or allied to your god.  Now, what's the word we use for aiding
and abetting the enemy in time of war?

	Of course, if you're Chaotic Greedy, you only care about what gives the
most plusses.
