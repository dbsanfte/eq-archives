Thats almost entirely right, but what I actually meant was 'addable
attack', via Strength or Vengeance/Aura (+attack) items. 

Interestingly, items which add to accuracy (plane of time+) don't
increase displayed ATK, which makes me think that rather than being
a composite number it is *solely* your to-damage number. I realise
it increases as weapon skill increases, but weapon skill increases
both to-hit and to-damage. I think we're only seeing the visible
to-damage increase.
