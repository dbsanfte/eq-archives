There are a handful of new zones, and a few quests have been added, but
I'd say most of the action has been in Kunark and Velious. I don't hear
Altunic Jartin spamming all of the East Commons regularly anymore, but
then again, even if he is, it's probably drowned in the auctioning
hubbub in the zone.

Other than that, business as usual in the Old World.
