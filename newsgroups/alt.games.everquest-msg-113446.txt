Since the last major patch (yes....i assume verant is always at fault)
I have been getting some sever lag spikes. What happens is that I run
along normally then the lag-o-meter starts counting down to 100%
packet loss. It turns from green to yellow to red and the right side
disappears completely. This happens about every 2 to 5 minutes but i
never go LD, I just get a refresh on what has happened over the last
few seconds. Sometimes it can be as short as 2 or 3 seconds and
sometimes as long as 10. I am currently playing a cleric so I dont
even need to go into how bad it affects my ability to contribute to a
group. Last night I log on and everything is fine again! No lag
spikes, good latency ..... and a happy group that can guarantee a
gheal landing on time. Has anyone else experienced this and had it
fixed last night? My comp hasnt changed (except for me turning
serverfilter on and setting datarate to 3 last sunday.....but it still
was spiky until last night. I called my ISP to see if they have
anything different and the tech said no. Since so much stuff can
happen downstream I wonder if there was anything I could do to
alleviate the situation. Then again, its convenient to just blame
verant. hehehe
