LOL, Who knew you were a clinical psychologist ? I certainly didn't. I
really am impressed with your extensive use of the "F" word as always. Guess
it makes you feel all bad and stuff. Of course, you knew I would say that
being the genius you are. Kinda funny how I get on your nerves though.

 Now, evaluate this: If its so bad, why you reading it?
LOL, First you fail as a clinical psychologist , then as pretending to have
any sort of vocabulary, and probably suck at EQ too. I am on Drinal, come
prove it NG commando. I'll do you like I did Lokari. You'll spend your
nights running scared from a game you only think you know.  Stick to
checkers son, cause just like masturbation, your probably good at it.

Have a Nice Day !!!!
