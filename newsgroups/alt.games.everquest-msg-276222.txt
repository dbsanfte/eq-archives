And, once again, anyone who thinks that the opinions expressed in a
game's own forums are a reflection of the overall feel of the all the
players is either naive or stupid. Forums are always HEAVILY skewed
toward the negative. If the views on forums indicated the overall
opinion of the players, not one single MMO out there would have lasted
through its first year.
