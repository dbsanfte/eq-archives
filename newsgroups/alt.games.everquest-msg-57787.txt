Weird experience, but I don't know if it's a bug I should report, or jus
the way things are programmed.

I've been happily killing the Sisters in OoT for a couple of levels. One
nice thing is that they always drop rusty halbards. (Dmg=10). Well, this
morning I succeeded in casting my firt even con, level sixteen pet with
my new spell. I handed him a halbard, and he would not equip it. (Didn't
offer to give it back or pay for it either, greedy bastard.) I gave him
two, and the same results.

Later, using the same spell, I cast a couple of either lvl 14 or 15 pets
and they took the weapons just fine, but not the sixteen. I checked on
necro.eqclasses.com pet information list, but it just says that my pet
get's kick at 16 which shouldn't affect his ability or willingness to
equip a weapon.

Yet another mystery.
