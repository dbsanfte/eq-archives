You have already proven that you are COMPLETELY clueless about EQ, and
none of the "information" you have posted previously is new or worth
reading.

Even if you do come up with a Sony IP, it doesn't mean you work with
or on EQ. Sony is a large corporation, and they have thousands of
employees that have nothing to do with EQ directly.

You really are nothing more than a sad little troll with too much time
on his hands.
