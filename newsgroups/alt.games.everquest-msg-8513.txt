Legions of Cabalis goes up very sloooowly.    I'm a 53 necro and have been
fighting sarnaks forever in OT and Burning Woods and I'm still threatening
to them.

Outpost faction is raised by turning in 4 sarnak warbraids (from sarnak
berzerkers in OT) to the Captain Rottgrime in OT.   It takes quite a few of
those to raise faction too, but not nearly as much as the Cabalis faction.
