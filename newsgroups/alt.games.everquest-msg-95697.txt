Actually, I *think* that a heal while they're feigned it's fine.  It's the 
heal as they're about to feign that's the problem.  If you heal before the 
monk feigns the mob sees you healing them, then the monk drops off the 
hate list, but that meddling caster is still there and looks like a much 
easier target, especially since that monk went down with only one punch.  
:)  Monks, SKs, and Necros, feel free to correct me if I'm on the pipe 
here.
