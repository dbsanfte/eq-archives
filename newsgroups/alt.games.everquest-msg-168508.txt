Lance never really worked on the Rude skill, I don't think. Go piss off DT 
or bizbee if you want rude. :)

}Your body lasts 7 days, while its only rezable for 3 hours.  This leaves 6 days

}despite what you may have felt.

Another factor to consider:  I believe you said you got killed near where 
you go if you zone with low hit points?  That's probably the succor point 
in WW, which is about 30 feet from the end of the zone tunnel to SG.  
Probably wouldn't even have needed a necro, just a /corpse hotkey and quick 
feets. :)
