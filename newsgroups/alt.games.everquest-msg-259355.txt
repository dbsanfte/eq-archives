I recently picked up a copy of EverQuest Platinum for $30. 7 of 8 expansions
for $30 is a great deal. Anyways, I installed game and played it for a few
hours and it worked fine. The next day I get on and get hit by some hard lag
spikes that just eventually get me with "You Have Been Disconnected" after
this happens my "ready" light on my dsl modem (Westell WireSpeed unsure of
model #) starts blinking and has even turned red at times. If I wait a few
minutes the ready light will stop blinking and my connection resumes.
Sometimes I have to restart my connection by typing "launchmodem" in my
browser and using the interface there. I called BellSouth and they said my
modem was actually a router and that the NAT servers could be messing up the
game. I play a ton of other online games and have never had a problem like
this before. I get on and can play for 5 minutes to an hour it all
depends...but I eventually do get disconnected. I was really thinking about
switching to cable to try that out if this issue does not resolve. If anyone
is using BellSouth with this same modem pleeease help out if you've had the
same problem. I'm open for any suggestions though.
