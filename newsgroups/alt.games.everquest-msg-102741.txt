Best response I've seen from a druid to request for unnecessary SoW:
"Why?  Where are you going?"

If you're not the puller, and your group isn't travelling, and either
there is no real risk of TPW or it's impossible or unreasonable to run
for the zone when things go bad, you don't need SoW.  So even tho the
mana cost is small, why annoy the druid/shaman/ranger with a pointless
request?

Same goes for STR, it makes almost zero difference to your damage
output, so unless there's a fair amount of sitting around waiting
for a spawn (or whatever) and the caster is offerring buffs just for
something to do there's no point in asking for it.

Who long ago outgrew his addiction to SoW.
