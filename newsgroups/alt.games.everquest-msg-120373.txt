It's possible that you got slimed by a retailer who took a
returned box and sold it as "new".  I was in Jerkit City,
uhh, I mean Circuit City the other day and some guy was
returning an open EQ box.  They are supposed to "defect"
it and return it to the manufacturer for credit, but often
times the grunt behind the counter just chucks it back on
the shelf.

Were there any signs that you copy had been previously
opened?
