Recent posts here have stressed the point that a lot of people claim to
know some EQ fact or other, when really they only *think* they know.  How
agro and taunt work, ldon dungeon levels, etc.

While I was cruising through lucy.fnord.net, it occurred to me that, in
fact, I really have *no* idea what poison, disease, and curse counters
are, how they work or how they go away. I've blithely assumed that they
have something to do with spell duration, and how tough they are to cure,
but otherwise I'm in the dark.

Is there anyone here who can shed some light? or at least point to a web
site that can? Thanks!
