If you are going to do it manually you better use a slow 2H weapon.
Dual weilding and/or fast weapons will make it far more difficult to
calculate.  Offhand attacks make it difficult to analyze.  And if you
hit fast enough you won't know whether or not that was a successful
double attack or two attacks stamped with the same time (since the log
only records data by the second).

Come to think of it, if you set it up right why couldn't you just turn
on autoattack and watch the "You must click on a target" messages.
They fire off every time you would have attacked, no?
