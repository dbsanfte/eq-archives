  I doubt it's a FV alignment specific problem.  I've had this sort of
thing happen to me.  Verant just hasn't gotten around to fixing all
the grouping related bugs yet.  Usually camping and re-entering the
game will fix most of these annoying issues.

  Or does this happen to you consistently or every time you try?  If
so, I'd do a /bug and a /petition to try to get it sorted out.
