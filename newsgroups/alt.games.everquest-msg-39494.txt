Well, stamina will translate to more hp; stamina over 100 will negate
the penalty to combat when your stamina bar is empty. Strength, based
upon months of statistical analysis by many in the warrior and shaman
community, has a very small impact on your max damage (which you will
only hit very rarely anyway) and average damage (since we are talking
about SK's here, we don't need to worry about the more noticeable
effects strength may have on rogue backstab or monk attacks). I
certainly don't see it adding 10-20 points per hit (are you thinking of
the damage bonus or something?). Damn, I can't find my link to Ruatha's
analysis thread on the old Shaman's Crucible; anyone else have it handy?
I think you'll find it enlightening.

Could you provide the statistical analysis which leads to this
conclusion, please?
