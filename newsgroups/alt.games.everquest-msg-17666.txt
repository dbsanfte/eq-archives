Color Shift is an AoE stun, like color flux. Mesmerisation isn't a stun,
its an AoE Mezz, different thing entirely.

Stun will temporarily stun a critter, same as if you've bashed him with
a shield or something. This only lasts a short time, but it can be
enough to get another spell off without the mob getting a hit in to
interrupt you, which is when you cast a mezz on them. The mezz puts them
to sleep completely, so they just stand there staring into space, and
they don't wake up until they get hit, get a damaging spell cast on
them, or the spell wears off (generally a lot longer duration, 48
seconds or something for Mesmerisation, as opposed to a couple of
seconds for stun).

Now, mesmerisation is pretty much the same as mesmerize or enthrall
except it affects multiple targets - this is the one where you first
start being able to mezz yourself if you're standing in the wrong place
:)
