Both of these are good reasons for inspections and the main reason I say
inspections should be allowed or disallowed by the player. If the player is
selling gear he is wearing the he can enable himself to be inspected. If it
means more to you the kind of gear he wears than his playing skill or
personality then ask to see his gear when he joins the group. Are you gonna
kick him out if he is under geared but has great skill? Or maybe you are
gonna not let him join because his gear suggests he is twink and you do not
like twinks...even though his gear will make your group a lot stronger and
therefore you would get XP faster?

I would love to be able to turn off people inspecting me in EC tunnel
because I never sell gear I am wearing and it would help stop the additional
spam of people offering to buy my gear or begging in that already spam
ridden zone. Being able to turn off inspections would also stop people from
judging a book by his cover and prejudicing them from joining a group just
because of his gear and not his other traits.

Nuf Sed!
