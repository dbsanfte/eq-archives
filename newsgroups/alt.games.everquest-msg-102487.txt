Hiya y'all,

I'm not really naked.... *grinz* - but I will have about 1100pp (when I 
*do* go naked) to purchase equipment. I'm a BAR/WAR....

I dont know what I should be getting and how much I should be spending 
on it-

I took a look at the "EQ Prices" website and wrote down a list of the 
equipment that I felt looked interesting for my character, but as far as 
prices and all the rest of it go- I realise its not the greatest source.

I'll put in my list- any advice and/or price checks, best places to pick 
up the various items, etc, etc. on the items (or other suggestions) 
would be greatly appreciated.

Weapon: Axe of the Iron Back
Range: Dragoon Dirk
Wrists: Braces of Erollisi (x2)
Shoulders: crafted pouldron
Neck: Ry`Gorr Chain Collar
Legs: Blackend Alloy Legplates
Gead: Skull Shaped Babute
Hand: Ulthork Hide Gloves
Finger: Jagged Band (x2)
Feet: Blood Cruster Leather Boots
Ears: Orc Fang Earring (x2)
Chest: Chitlin Shell Armor
Back: Cloak of the Ice Bear
Arms: Blackend Alloy Armplates
Face: Fine Plate Visor

Thanks,
