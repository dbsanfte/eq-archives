Killed the Undead Cyclops in SK today, and it had a very very
pronounced AFI range... in fact that range is only slightly further
than max cast range for Combust.  If I moved too far ahead,
the thing would turn and walk out of range before my spell went
off!  If I closed back in, it would turn back around and start
sauntering over towards me again, with its reach, coming perilously
close to melee range before the nuke went off.

Unfortunately for my Static versus Wandering theory, the UC
is certainly a wanderer.

Think its a behavior flag like frenzy, AFI range.
