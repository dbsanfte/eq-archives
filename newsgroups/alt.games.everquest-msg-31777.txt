No. This applies to people that think they can pick and choose which
rules they are going to follow, inspite of agreeing to follow them.

This is true. You choose how you can deal with things you don't like.  If there
is a system in place to try and change things, by all means use it.  If the thing
you are trying to change is a violation of something, then you are within your
rights to do so.  Of course in the section this is in reply to, you are being a
hypocrit.  You could just ignore that some folks petition stupid names
and go on with your life instead of complaining about it like a puss...
