There was some discussion recently about whether being dispelled by
a mob always removes your "top" buffs (i.e., the ones listed first
in your buff window).  The original thread was a derail in the topic
"An unbiassed look at the Cleric OoW spells :p".  General opinion
seemed to be that maybe it used to work that way, but some people
thought they'd recently seen other buff slots being dispelled.

Well, I was hunting sirens last night, so I got dispelled several
times.  The first time, it did indeed hit my first few slots.  But
on a later battle, I noticed it hit my 4th and 5th.  I'm sure the
slots were dispelled (not expired) because I'd just recast those
buffs before that battle.  (One of them was Everlasting Breath, not
something you want to see go away when fighting sirens. :-)

My top five slots, in order, were:
- Resist Magic
- Skin Like Nature
- Form of the Great Wolf
- Levitation
- Everlasting Breath

From my logs, it looks like both Lev and EB got dispelled by a
single dispel.

Also, in an earlier battle dispels had removed both SLN and FotGW,
in separate dispels, so it's not as though the siren dispel was
"too weak" to remove those and thus had skipped them to remove
later buffs.  (As an aside, losing wolf form (and thus sow) in the
middle of a battle is almost as annoying as losing EB.  Maybe I'll
rethink the merits of a druid buying Run3. :-)

Another aside, apropos the current necro side thread of using mounts
to get mana regen while pet-tanking: I may revisit getting my druid
a mount as well, because I assume it would let me get mana regen
while root-rotting casters.  (Currently I have to run out of their
range to med, and finding my way back underwater can sometimes be
awkward.)
