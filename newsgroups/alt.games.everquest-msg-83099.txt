No, they look for classes they *think* will serve them better in an
exp group. The thing is, most players never *think* about AE, or know
what it can do.

Yep. Because anytime a wizard gets in a group people say crap like:

"use an AE spell and you're out"

So naturally, stripped of their most effective spell line, the wizard
looks inferior compared to other classes. If players would instead use
group strategies that abuse the strength of the wizard class, they
would see the  real power of a wiz.

It's how you and your dull ilk play 99% of the game. That doesn't mean
it's the only way to play, or even that it is the best way to play.
All it means is that that is how the herd wants to play.

Nope. You don't seem to understand how ridiculously powerful and mana
efficient the AE spells can be.

Nor can you put on your "wizards suck" blinders and say they have
nothing to contribute to groups.
