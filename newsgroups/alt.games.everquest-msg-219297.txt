Based on personal experience, I disagree. Just dropping malo and slow
on 3 mobs will eat up half of my mana bar. A big pull will usually see
me going from 80m to 10-20m (and back up 80m by the time all of them
are dead).

Yup

No, but when that druid nukes does affect the efficiency of the group
and he'll have a lot more flexibility if he's normally running at 80m
instead of 40m.

Sure it is, one person was just too stubborn to admit it <g>.

I'm biased because my main is a shaman but I just can't agree with
that. Then again, I've never had a very large mana pool, I don't think
I broke 150 Wis till I hit 60th lvl and even at 65 my mana pool is
only sitting at around 3600. If I had a larger mana pool (a bigger
margin for error) I might feel differently but I've always been of the
opinion that any caster who cruises at 30m over an hour or so is
screwing up and nothing I've seen in the recent threads on the subject
have caused me to reconsider that opinion.  The good ones know when to
build up a reserve and when to use it up. 

I do agree that size of mana pool is pretty irrelevent in almost all
situations and has nothing to do with efficiency.
