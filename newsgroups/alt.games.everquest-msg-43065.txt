My son's Iksar Warrior hit 20 last night in Oasis, and now needs to move on.
Question is, where?

Obviously somewhere he stands a good chance of getting a bind.

Access to a merchant is reasonably necessary if he is to make any money,
though food/drink can be foraged.

Bank not important, he has managed up until now without one.

Lake of Ill Omen is front runner, I just question how easily he will find an
Iksar to re-bind him in Cabalis. This also solves the merchant and bank
issue. He will get Guild help with the journey!

Other possibilities are:

S Karana (bind in N Karana or Arena)
 - access to merchants? Guards on the NK-SK bridge?

High Hold Pass (bind in the pass near the Kith zone, or stay bound in WFP)
 - roaming guards and access to merchants?

Any other suggestions?
