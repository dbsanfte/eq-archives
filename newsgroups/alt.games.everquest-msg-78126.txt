DSL by itself isnt the problem. DSL is a perm connection to the internet, IE
when your machine is on, its connected. Unless you disable the networking.

So yes a firewall is a must.

Zone Alarm is popular but I find t flawed, so I use Tiny Firewall (don't let
the name fool you) its free for home use and can be downloaded from
http://www.tinysoftware.com/

Very easy to use, and very stable. Been using it for years. Best of al it
works fine with EQ ;)
