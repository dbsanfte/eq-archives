Not bad, but lacks imagination.  Going for the 'sex' angle is too
easy.  I give it 4.

If they are excluding you from thier raid solely because of your
class, I'm sorry, but they're assholes.

No, my guild doesn't keep ANYBODY out of a raid, reguardless of class,
or even if possible, level.  Might only be shooting for a 12 man raid,
but if we have 25 people show up, the more the merrier, even if it's
another 8 druids, a level 20 monk, and bunch of beastmasters.  

My guild has this wacky idea that we're ALL here to help each other
and, most importantly, have a good time.  That means excluding
somebody just because of the class is a no no.
