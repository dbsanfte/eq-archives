  today was the landfall of all time worst party member!!! I was playing the
role of primary healer as a lvl 35 shaman while a druid was our backup healer.
Now the puller pulls two sabertoothed tigers which are huge mana hogs imo..and
i went oom..asked the druid please heal im oom...puller at 1/2
health....please...heal!!!! puller near 1/4 health and panics..starts running
...DAMN YOU HEAL IM OOM!!!!! puller falls down...the other memebers start
trying like mad to kill this beast and he goes down after most of the party
looses a good amount of their health...i scroll up to see if maybe the druid
stated afk...nope...after abou 5 mins or so and im back to FM....i asked the
druid his mana status...no responce...i boot him frim the group...after a good
hour hes back and boy is he pissed!!!! Start yelling and asking to come
back....what a outrage!...I have a new idea for groups to keep things going
110%...its called survivor style group! Every hour the is a vote on whom gets
the boot...hehe maybe that will keep members intuned
