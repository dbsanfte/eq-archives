can happen for a couple reasons. one thing that commonly happens , is if you
are adjacent to other traders someone might accidently click on you when
they were intending on clickin on someone else. another thing that commonly
happens is when some1 camps for the night and logs on the next day , if they
spawned on top of you or really close to you , and use the right mouse
button to look around, they might have accidently clicked on you in the
process. you can compare that to how sometimes ppl will accidently inspect
you in a battle. finally , yes , sometimes ppl window shop, mainly to check
and see if some1 accidently put the wrong price on an item , so always check
your prices to insure a window shopper doesnt get something that was suppose
to have an extra zero on the end of it , lol. well hope this helps ya out
and gives ya an idea on why that happens. GL to ya . -DoC

I have bought many many bazaar bargains that I am guessing were mistakes,
including a Bladestopper for 75pp (but without any charges).
