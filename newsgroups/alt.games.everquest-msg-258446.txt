Actually, I was thinking the same as you, until I got to the very last line.
Permanent see invisible sounds damn nice to me at the moment.   Now that I
upgraded my earrings to the point where my Fingerbone Hoop is no longer worn
permanently.   I have to swap it in to follow people, and I keep forgetting
to swap it out.   It's also created some problems, when I couldn't see
another group that was invisble, and they ended up training us.

Convenience AA, yeah.  But again, sounds nice to me.  I don't have EB on any
of the gear I normally wear.   I have a choice between EB neck, 41% haste
100 hp neck, and 250 hp neck with 15 atk.

I wouldn't mind never having to put on the no stats EB neck again. ; )   But
I doubt I'll buy it.  I'm guessing they'll make all the "lung capacity" AA's
from the previous expansions prerequisits.

Ah, but you forget quests.   Especially ones where you have to spend a great
deal of time farming rare drop components in a hard to reach place, in order
to attempt a combine with a trivial over 250.    I would also be suprised if
they *didn't* add more quests with OOW, which have such high trivials that
these AA's are the only way to reasonably complete them.

Not sure.   Another round of Planar Power.   *shrug*

I have.  All sorts of things you can do when your resists are GoD level.
Mostly in terms of one grouping old raid content.

I hadn't heard that resists were ever capped though.

Buff slots.   You can have 15 buffs in effect on you, plus 1 for each level
of this AA.

Hah.   Might be nice, I suppose... but in the days where 1000 hitters are
considered low damage mobs, 500 hp of unconsious won't go very far, I'm
thinking.   A lot farther than the 10'ish? points we have now... but not as
far as you'd think.

My warrior sometimes does.   As a pre-elemental warrior, trying to hold
aggro off a few time+ melees... I get to use my Incite taunting move a
*lot*.   Throw in any kind of an unexpected situation where I have to use a
defensive discipline, and suddenly I'm pretty low and in danger of running
out.

I don't have the GoD AA for endurance regen though.

Yeah, but stacked on top of all the "more crits" AA's that have been
available, suddenly it's sounding pretty nice.    Still eye candy more than
anything, but a fun AA.

I never bought the finishing blows either.  This is still going to be one of
the last AA's I get.   Killing a mob thats already made it to run mode, and
therefore won't be doing you any more damage...  woo?

Who cares, more defensive AA's!  : D

Maxing out the PoP ones seemed  (yes, I know, possible placebo effect) to
make a huge difference in lowering the damage I take.   More, more!

Heh.  Just look at it overall.   They're most likely going to double the FT
cap, 30 per person.   Or about double KEI.

And easier to not get aggro from your tank when nuking / debuffing / healing
damage from aforementioned 1k+ hitters.  (Likely much more than just 1000 a
swing with OOW.)

Yeah, but here you get the increase just for buying the AA.   With the mana
regen one, getting the AA is only part of the equation.  You then have to
find gear with 15 more Flowing Thought on it!

It will be the same as healing adept type things.

Since LoY, rare post 60 spells have been available through research, for
those that don't do the raids to get them.

Who knows, maybe they'll make the level 70 spells researched.

No.  Illusions are generally 30 minutes.    This sounds to me like they're
giving the enchanter Permanent Illusion AA to everyone, for use with either
masks, or project illusion cast on them from an enchanter.

Although, this could just be a bard / rogue AA, since they get the most
masks.   I'm sure not all of these generals are going to everyone.   And a
lot of duplicates only get mentioned for the first class that gets them.
(I see below warriors only have 3 AA"s listed.   I'm sure many of the others
above they'll get too, to make it a decent number.)

Double that.   It's a 2% increase in DPS, and a 2% decrease in mob DPS.

I've liked the strikethrough AA very much on my warrior.

And actually, I'm wondering how many levels of this they'll offer.   Sounds
like they might be trying to clear up the imbalance with dual wielding where
mobs riposte tanks using them more.

There already is.   However it's already overbalanced in two handers favor
at the moment, and it will be getting even more so.   With mob damage going
through the roof, one extra riposte, just one, means 1000 to 2000 extra
damage.    Damage shields at level 70 will be up to what, 60 points per hit?
Then factor in that one handed weapons are twice as fast, and you're using
two, so 4 times as many attacks as a two hander.   You're talking about a
whole shitload more damage there.
