Please correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you saying that trivial loot code
is a bad idea because high levels won't care about it anyway?

Doesn't sound like much of an argument to me.

"Trivial loot su><><0rz maan...not like I'd go there anyway!"

And if a high level player wanted to start farming that zone ("Hey, I pays
my $10/mo, I have a fucking RIGHT to farm that shit away from your n00bie
azz.  Who gives a SHIT if you'd get expo, and theses bitzes were green to me
20 levels ago!  I PAY $10/MO, THEREFORE I AM A G0D SO FUCK OFF") then that
would be a reason FOR the code.

Now, if you'd like to explain why it's bad for characters of appropriate
range for that zone, please explain why.  If you did already, it wasn't
clear to me, so please reword it.
