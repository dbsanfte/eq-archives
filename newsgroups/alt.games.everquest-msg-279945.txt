> Try some other online games first. EQ didnt lose over half its players for
no reason.

Actually I am a very seasoned MMORPG player (currently Playing WoW with
a 60 Warrior / 40 Rogue / 20 Priest). I could list off all the MMOs
that I have played but it would take me a while to do so..hehe
EQ left a very good taste in my mouth because it feels like no other
game that I have played before. WoW is a great game but its lack of
Support and horrible community (infested with imature kiddies) is
ruining the whole experience for me.
