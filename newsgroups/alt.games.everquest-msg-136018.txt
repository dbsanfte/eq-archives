That level 40 paladin has higher melee skills than you'll
ever have, double attack, and riposte all at (or near) their
max to level 50.  They're also going to have comparable
strength since their armor is either likely to have the same
stats (they're a plate/WIS class too, obviously) plus they'll
have the benefit of never really needing to neglect STR in
favor of WIS and they've probably put more points into STR
at creation as well.  It's a rare cleric who doesn't max WIS
at creation;  paladins get the typical STR and STA choice
with the rest thrown at WIS.

And paladins share the melee damage table with warriors at
that level anyway, a distinct advantage over a priest and
their "well, they do have to be able to melee and kill a
level 10 mob at 60" damage table...

And they're going to get a damage bonus you don't that
means they'll out-damage out you even without the other
advantages.

Then you're missing some reports.  The *only* reliable way
to parse damage is to have the individual doing the damage
parse their own logs.  That'll happen if you have to sit
back to med, for instance, and I'm not sure you get the
damage reports from Riposte anyway.  (I got rid of the
Other Damage spam quite a long time ago...)

The *only* way you outdamaged a paladin after level 20 (when
they get double attack) is by having a FAR superior weapon.
By 30 (when they get Riposte) you'd have to be wielding an
"end game" weapon to stay close to a moderately well-equipped
paladin.  By 40 when their skills are at max there's no way
unless the paladin is wielding fine steel or rusty weapons.
Their ATK is going to be substantially higher, they're on a
better damage table, they have a damage bonus for their
weapons, and they get double attack and riposte so you're not
even getting a one-to-one swing ratio with the same weapon.

Neither is fantastic enough to account for what you're saying.
The first (and I think the 2nd now) are both even paladin
weapons too and there's *no* way you can keep up with a
paladin wielding the same weapon.  You couldn't out-damage
a 40th paladin *at 60* wielding that same weapon, in fact.
