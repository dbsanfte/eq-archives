Hey man, that was supposed to be a joke :)

But really, if the OP were to take me seriously, all that would happen would
be he'd die once very near where he started, and lose maybe 30 seconds of
game time and no exp or gear... after that I assume he would realize I was
talking out my ass and ignore my helpful advice :)  I wouldn't give advice
like that if it would actually hurt anyone, you know me, I'm a nice guy...
