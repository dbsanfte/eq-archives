No-no-no :) The main point of an enchanter PLing is mem blur. The 
levelee (or whatever you call that) just has to throw in the last hit or 
two.
works especially nice on casters -- they get to throw one nuke per 
fight, and their hurting skills don't really matter. Ones that matter 
are trivial to cap in safe conditions
