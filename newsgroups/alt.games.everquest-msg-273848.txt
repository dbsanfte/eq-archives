   And endearing name for a girl?!?  How old is that dictionary?  Ok, I
don't doubt that an online dictionary might say that, but come on!  If
anyone ever said "Hi, pussy" to me I wouldn't get the warm fuzzies.  And
your cut n'paste left out the biggest meaning of the word as it is used
in American English today.  Namely, the word "Pussy" means "Vagina", and
is often used as an attack to insinuate that someone isn't brave or a
man in some manner.

    From the Merriam-Webster On-line dictionary:

http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=fuck

Main Entry: fuck 
Pronunciation: 'f&k
Function: verb
Etymology: akin to Dutch fokken to breed (cattle), Swedish dialect fokka
to copulate
intransitive senses
1 usually obscene : COPULATE -- sometimes used in the present participle
as a meaningless intensive
2 usually vulgar : MESS 3 -- used with with
transitive senses
1 usually obscene : to engage in coitus with -- sometimes used
interjectionally with an object (as a personal or reflexive pronoun) to
express anger, contempt, or disgust
2 usually vulgar : to deal with unfairly or harshly : CHEAT, SCREW   

  Hey, *that* word is in the dictionary too!  I should be able to use it
freely in the MMORPG's that I play! Oh, and since I have
Merriam-Websters up, let's see what those fine folk think the word
"pussy" means.  Ah, here it is, under the second definition of the
word...

Main Entry: 2pus�sy 
Pronunciation: 'pu-sE
Function: noun
Inflected Form(s): plural pussies
Etymology: perhaps of Low German or Scandinavian origin; akin to Old
Norse puss pocket, pouch, Low German puse vulva, Old English pusa bag
1 usually vulgar : VULVA
2 a usually vulgar : SEXUAL INTERCOURSE b usually vulgar : the female
partner in sexual intercourse   


  Hmmmm... Vulva and not vagina?  Guess I learned something then.  Great
tools, dictionaries.

  Holy cow, that *is* some leet speak.  Man oh man!  Maybe you got
suspended for that, instead.  Maybe you broke some poor GM's mind as he
or she tried to wrap their head around that.

    Side question to the members of both newsgroups.  Is there allot of
leet speak going on in WoW?  I know that the members of the Blizzard
community have a reputation for being the types that go for this sort of
thing, but I would think that there are allot of people who are new to
Blizzard that might not be like that.  So I'm just curious as to the
usage of real English that is in use in the game.

   Patience, eh?  That sound unreasonably optimistic.

   May be given a warning.  May be suspended, also.  Even if that isn't
spelled out, which I don't know since you may have very well used
selective cut and pasting.  Not saying that you did, but it is a
possibility.  Anyways, the "may" in the EULA above does give them a bit
of breathing room.

  It all depends on context, my friend.  

  "Look at the cool artwork on that bush over there, next to the big
tree!"

  "Nice to meet you Teapray.  I'd sure love to trim your bush."

   Guess what.  One of these can earn you a suspension, and one almost
certainly won't.

    More optimism!

    Interesting argument.  "Leet Speak isn't English, therefore it
doesn't count."  Not being sarcastic here, I really do think that this
is an interesting angle.  But I don't think it holds water.  Leet, and
it is hard for me to say this, is English.   Really badly mangled and
annoying English.  It is geared to be understood by English speakers. 
True, not all English speakers might have picked up on what you typed.  
But the people who would have understood it are the ones that speak
English.

    You might be thirty year old.  But mature?  Nope, not at all.

   Well, they are still thanking you, but not paying lip service to your

     Pussy is a reference to human anatomy.  If you say to someone,
"You're a pussy" what you are actually saying is "You're a vulva", and
the implication from the analogy is that they are womanly, in a bad
way.  Since the stereotype of women is that we are weak willed and
easily frightened, this meaning is carried over to your target.  But
just because you only mean "You're a wimp" doesn't mean you aren't using
a word that refers to genitalia.

   I would bet that a manager has already seen them.   And is laughing
his or her head off.

    Ya for EQII!  Really, this threat isn't going to make them think "Oh
no!  We're going to loose $15 a month!"  No, they are going to think
"Ya!  We're losing a troublemaker.  Our biggest competitor is gaining a
jerk that will likely drive away players from them, and some will
probably come to us!"

    If anyone at Blizzard has any sense of humor at all, I hope they
tell you on Monday "Ok, whatever.  We'll end the ban.  Happy?"

    Well done, though.   My opinion of the folks at Blizzard has risen
considerably from you posting of this exchange.
