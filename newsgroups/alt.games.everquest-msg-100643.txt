Don't over-estimate how much they made on those expansions. If you
paid $40 for one, it's pretty likely that Verant only saw $10 of it.

Yes. Count how many zones were in the original world sometime. Then
count how many in each expansion. The math is pretty straightforward.

If it was *just* players, you might be partially right. But the game
has to keep track of each zone, who is in each zone, what NPCs are in
each zone, what loot the NPCs have allocated, what the vendors have in
their inventory, and so on. A zone doesn't cease to exist if no one is
in it, and it still requires machine resources.

Inflation over that time has been something like 8.3 percent.

Yes, hardware-per-power costs have gone down, but utilities like
electricity and bandwidth have gone up. And of course with more
machines to maintain, you need more people, and the cost of each
employee has gone up over three years as well.

>So I have some trouble buying the "due to increased costs" argument. 

Yes, well, you're not the one running the business, so I think it's
fair to say you're not exactly an expert on it.
