Well.. i've been gone from the game for a bit now and just got back
on. Figured there wouldn't be anyone on my friends list and that
everyone would be gone. Lo and behold, the usual suspects are still
online, still play, and really... i don't notice much change since I
left, except for the fact my friends have progressed... and some have
passed me in the time since i've been gone. A couple have ebayed over
time because they needed the cash, but that rollover always tends to
happen. The only noticeable difference is its a bit easier to get
trader up in offhours... and I don't find that a bad thing. There are
something like 6 guilds in Time now so its camped up the kazoo. Quite
a bit of GoD raiding seems to be going on as well.

Kind of glad i missed the majority of the dx9 and collison bugs, nice
how that worked out.
