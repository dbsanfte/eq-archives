ok here's the deal....
I had a box of old parts kicking around so I re-built my OOOLLLLDDDD PII
333 to just use as a web surfer when playing EQ. This system I 
originally used for playing EQ until, I think, Lucilin came out. Just 
for kicks I tried to play EQ on it the other day so I loaded new GeForce 
drivers, etc...and fired it up. To my surprise I could play pretty well 
with all models off.

Then I tried to play again the next day and as soon as the EULA screen 
popped up the system froze, and froze again each time I tried.... until 
I went into the EQ folder and and deleted the eqmain.dll and 
exgfx_dx8.dll, then when I fired it up it loaded fine.

I was just curious if there is anything people could think is causing 
the problem, and please no "it's the system" as I know it's under 
powered but like I said if I do the steps I mentioned it played fine for 
5 hours. I also tried many versions of GeForce drivers ( from 2000 to 
current version ) just to make sure drivers were good.

many thanks for any info
