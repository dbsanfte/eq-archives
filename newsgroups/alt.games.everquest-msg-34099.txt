Anyone who was the age of that woman, who doesn't know that
the lids don't stay on the cups for shit, and is still dumb
enough to stick the cup of coffee between their legs,
deserves whatever burns they recieve.  Kinda like the
opening monologue on Leno last night talking about the
schools of sharks coming into shore in Florida.  I guess
there were idiots that went out to try to "pet" the sharks. 
As Leno puts it, more power to them, cleans up our gene pool
so the human race can move forward.

Cthulhu Loves Me

Cthulhu loves me, this I know
For the High Priests tell me so
He won't eat me, no not yet
He's our Lord, all dank and wet
