Before the coup, oops, I meant election, it was said of W that the greatest 
favor he could do for his father would be to get elected because then his 
father would become only the second stupidist man to occupy the White Houe.

The Bush Administration's policies are easily defined:

Domestic:
1. Enrich the rich;
2. Trash the Constitution.

Foreign:
1. Kill Iraqis;
2. Israel can do no wrong.

Anybody watch that so-caled press conference last night? The guy talked like 
a simperinmg undertaker, and every question got the same answer, like a 
broken record. No matter what the subject of the question, it got virtually 
the same speech, not answer, in return.  Didn't change any minds in thnis 
household.
