Hopefully you won't find a /report waiting for you when you next log on,
if only for generally looking foolish. Let's just look at what happened,
shall we? You arranged the details of the trade and put the wurmy in the
trade window. Now, the guy "steps up close waits a couple seconds". Gee,
you don't suppose he was examining the item you were offering to make
sure that it was what you said and not one of a million other things
with the same in-game graphic, huh? And then possibly fishing around in
his inventory for the item to give you? 

Now, on to his next terrible crime. "and then cancels the trade". So. he
cancelled the trade. Suppose he'd clicked on something in *his*
inventory that shouldn't be part of the deal by accident? Or maybe he
couldn't locate the item in his inventory quickly enough and didn't want
to keep you waiting all that time? Or maybe he accidentally clicked on
the cancel button. Or maybe he just decided he didn't want to do the
deal? So what? Hitting cancel on a trade is nothing petitionable and
could be explained by a million other things.

So what does this mastermind of evil do next? "For the next 10
seconds I get to watch them do the "twitch" and move around my feet
(like you see people doing when they drop something)"

Yeah. Right. Also like people do when they are suddenly hit with
tremedous lag and can't type anything or can't click on anything for a
minute. Or are having a lockup. Or a million other things.

Next? "Then I get a tell "Sorry, here", and the item I was trading for
is placed in a trade window. We finish the trade, and the scammer
immediately /quits and goes [LD]."

Oh My God! That EVIL BASTARD! He actually had the nerve to re-open the
trade window, put the item YOU *agreed* to trade the wurmy for in, and
hit the trade button before you even put up your wurmy? What a clever
plot. Truly a scammer to be admired by criminals everywhere. And if the
deal was done as per both party's agreement, WHY WOULD HE BOTHER
QUITTING? Gee.. ya think maybe he *was* having connection problems
earlier in the trade and finally his connection crapped out entirely?

But wait, let's see what our intrepid hero does in response to the
evildoer's clever plan:
"Needless to say my WS was well protected by an open inventory slot and
the scammer wasted thier time. I got the item I was looking for, and
actually made a profit on the deal. I am guessing that the scammer
finished the trade to avoid a /report."

Oh, obviously. </sarcasm> Either that, or he just finished the trade
both of you agreed to and was having some connection problems on his
end. You're here whinging about this why, again? Did you lose something
in this deal? Oh, wait... no. You said you made a profit.
