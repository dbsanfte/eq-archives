We just need a better quest engine.

None of this camp Bill until bills head drops. If Bill spawns but is 
missing his head I don't see why he needs me to kill him!!!

If they want to drag the quest on a bit... add more stuff, not rare 
stuff. Kill Bill, Bob, and Gary.

And if they want me to kill the same sort of mob 20 times then tell me 
to bring back 20 white goblin shamen eyes (which drop of every single 
white goblin shamen.) Not bring me back one goblin shamen eye, which 
averages about 1 in 20 white goblins... but you might kill 300 before 
you see one if you are spectacularly unlucky.

Yup... only a fresh start (EQ2 if we are extraordinarily lucky) will 
solve that mess.
