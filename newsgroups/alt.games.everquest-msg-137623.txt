I have one hotkey devoted to my pet.  When I'm grouping with my shaman, I
don't find myself needing a bunch of pet commands, particularly now with the
implementation of pets not attacking mezzed mobs.  If my pet is attacking a
rooted mob that hit me, I find that back off doesn't generally work anyway.
With my Enchanter, well, I guess, when I charm something I have pet commands
that work.
