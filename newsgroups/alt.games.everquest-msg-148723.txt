Yes.  Had a 60 druid friend just find that out.  She'd known
about it, too, but apparantly had only bought 4 of the 5 specializations,
spending 2 points in one by mistake.

So then, despite my careful instructions, she goes and buys the
last skill, and promptly goes back to hunting, it isn't until a couple
days later she mentions that she had accidentally gotten Alteration
up over 50 first, and had to go back and do the "reset" quest!
