I think this is the "article" Kevin was referring to, I did wonder why you
never responded to it.

In retrospect, though, I'll add that an "ie" or "y" nickname is very often
used as a diminuative, not in the sense that it shortens a name, but in that
it implies a youth or lower power position, or familiarity.  Mom is more
mature than Mommy, Barb is more mature than Barbie, so on and so forth.  A
Wizard is a powerful and mysterious thing... a Wizzie is a little manaslinging
nuker.  And I'd think you'd prefer the term to "nuker" in that "nuke" is
clearly an artifact of a far more technological age.  Now if we'd call them
"grenadiers" perhaps you'd appreciate it more, or "petards"... and those who
accidentally include themselves in a GFlux radius could be "autohoists"...
