Was able to login both accounts earlier this morning just fine. Got a
wierd bug and decided to try to camp to desktop and back in. Now can't
hit the login server. Other account is still connected to the same
server and running just fine.

/sigh

Well, if they are recompiling the dowhatsahickie or whatever, and it has
to be done, I guess that's fine. Wish they'd dont it on a weekday,
though. Lower population to annoy then.
