I use em together.  It's VERY easy to miss stuff in zones sometimes if
you don't have a loc - IE a friend of mine swam around TD for a good
hour the other day because he was having trouble using loc, and all he
had was a vague idea of where the firepot spires are.  And when it's
raining out, you'll NEVER find them unless you happen to swim into
one.
