Five wizards. One cleric. Wizard one manaburns. Wizards 2,3, and 4 chain
cast sunstrike. Dragon pingpongs between them while the cleric chain
casts fast heals on whoever gets aggro that moment. 59 seconds later,
wizard 5 Manaburns. Dragon dies.

Watch for this announcement in the next patch message. :-)

"We're sorry. We've made another terrible mistake. After today's patch,
all wizards will be removed and replaced with mages. And none of you get
any more damned mod rods.  Ever.  Thanks for playing."
