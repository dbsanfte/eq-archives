  Windows 98 SE only costs $20 if you are buying the Windows 98 to
Windows 98 SE "update pack".  If you are upgrading from Windows 95 to
Windows 98, you're probably going to spend a minimum of $40 for an OEM
"license pack"... that's for first edition Windows 98 and no media and
it's useless to anybody who doesn't already have a Windows 98 cd.

  For most people, the more realistic price of upgrading from Windows
95 to 98+ is closer to $75 for the Windows Me upgrade.  And it seems
like every other person has something bad to say about Windows Me, so
I personally decided to avoid it and bought 98 instead... which, oddly
enough, tends to be more expensive.

  Just thought I'd clear that up.  A few people have been throwing
around the $20 to upgrade to Win98 when that's not really accurate.
Probably someone just went to pricewatch.com, clicked Operating
Systems and saw that the "best price" for Windows 98 is listed at $26
and didn't bother to check the details any further.  If somebody DOES
know of a place where you can buy either the full version of Windows
98 or better for $20, or an upgrade that will work for Windows 95,
please let me know.  I already blew $90 on Windows 98 myself, but if I
can save someone else $60-70, that's great.
