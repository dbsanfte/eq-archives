I'm not trolling so please dont flame me :)

I need a break. I'm not going to complain about the exp nerf (My
cleric will do ok but my Necro is out of luck). I also won't complain
about the fact I've spent 12 hours waiting for a GM to help with a
gear recovery after I found my corpse naked after the patch.
Hmmmm.....maybe I just complained a little.

I'm just going to smile and take an EQ vacation for a month or so.

I have played AO and DAoC. I cancelled both account prior to the free
period ending and never gave either game a fair chance because it
wasn't EQ.

I'm considering AC but have heard that hacking is a big problem in the
game.


Anyone have any experience with the above games? I play late at night
so the ability to solo or 2box would be great.
