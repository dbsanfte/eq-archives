Pretty much my thoughts.   This isn't dumbing anything down, because it's
not a real change.   It's one of the worst kept secrets that the official
party line on lost corpses is 100% pure bullshit.

GM's would always help you before your corpse rotted, and almost always
reimburse anything that did disappear.   Because a lost corpse is probably
the closest thing to a "game ending event" that I can think of.   If theres
one thing that would make a person over level 20 quit, it would be that.
Especially once getting equipped starts meaning months of time spent on end
game raiding.

All this does is automate the process.
