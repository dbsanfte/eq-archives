**I am guessing that this message would be for all ATI cards because of
ATI's bad driver problems (i love their cards but wish they would get their
drivers together )

My original problem is that the "large" boats graphics are really messed
up when i ride on them.  I have tride riding both the boat from Timorous
Deep to Overthere and Butcher Bock to Firiona Vie.  When the boat stops
or i approach it everything looks fine.  however, when i get on the boat
the graphics become "skewed".  It appears as if i am standing on water
or as if there are walls in front of me that aren't, or as if the boat
has been contorted into a new shape.  I have attached some pictures of
this so you can see.
