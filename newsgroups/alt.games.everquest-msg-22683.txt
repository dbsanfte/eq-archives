You are making the same mistake again. Just because something is a synonym
or a noun, does not mean it cannot be used as an adjective.

"Human" in the phrase "human man" would indeed be an adjective, this
tautology implies that there are other kinds of men that are non-human. (As
a sidenote, I have just finished reading a book that talks of "augmented
men, artificial men", where the phrase "human men" would not be out of place
at all).

I see the phrase kitty cat as referring to a kitten, rather than a full
grown cat.
