I disagree.

I am the way I am, I enjoy what I enjoy.  Your advice is similar to 
telling gay men that if they just shut up and had sex with women even 
though its not what they like, they'd be better off.

Heck, if what I liked in life was sitting around watching network 
television, I'd be happier doing that than playing EQ at all.  As it 
happens, I like playing RPGs and CRPGs and I've learned to live within 
the confines of EQ for most of that; its not the best thing I can 
imagine, but its the best that seems to exist at the moment.

I like leveling.  What can I tell you?  Some people like trade skills, 
some like getting gear, some like seeing new parts of the world, some 
like getting fellow players angry at them... or getting their respect.

I like some of those things too, but in particular I like leveling, and 
on the four occaisions when I've capped out a level (cleric hit 50, when 
that was as far as it went, second cleric hit 60 when that was as far as 
it went... but soon enough the cap was moved to 65, so same character 
when hitting 65, and now as a mage hitting 65) I've felt the same let 
down, the same "well he's never going to level again, now what"

When you say "what it is-- a game", you aren't really saying anything. 
A game, like a toy, is good for what we make of it.  There are a hundred 
ways to enjoy a little rubber ball, there are a hundred ways to enjoy 
EQ.  Of the ways, I like leveling.  Shoot me.

Splendid One, Done Leveling
Grage, berzerker, leveled ten times yesterday alone!
