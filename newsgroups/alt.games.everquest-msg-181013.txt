Reading your example, I don't think SOE takes the selling of accounts
as that serious a matter anymore.  Maybe the way they figure it is if
the account remains active, when it would not be otherwise, it's not
worth the hassle to go after those accounts.  I also think they aren't
as concerned with the assault on the game's integrity as seriously as
they once did with regards to account sales. So if that's the case,
they're not going to jump right on it to ban someone who purchased an
account.

Also, GMs may sometimes think that petitions similar to yours are the
product of a vendetta, rather than genuine concern over the EULA
violation, and they don't take them seriously no matter what evidence
you provide.  I know that a phrase like "how did you come by all this
information?" can demonstrate that the GM questions the validity of
your motives in reporting something like this.

But one thing no one's mentioned:  I don't know how it is on other
servers, but on my server, a conservative estimate of the number of
name changes under their new "$50 for a name change" policy that are
E-bayed characters changing their names after the transfer is greater
than 90%.  I'd be highly skeptical of any claim that SOE was not aware
of this.  I mean, do they seriously think that someone's going to wake
up, decide after 3 years that they want to be named Legolaz instead of
Llleggolasss and pay them 50 bucks to do it?  50 bucks is a lot of
money for a whim like that.  It's not a lot though, when you've spent
$1000 on a character and would like to avoid all those uncomfortable
tells from the friends of the person who owned the character before
you.

Anyway, getting back more ontopic, I wouldn't say that your example
shows that they wouldn't do something in this instance.  I can see how
something like this could strike a bigger blow to the game's integrity
and overall health than accounts sales would, and that's the sort of
thing SOE would be concerned about.
