Well, that was a fun couple days of flamage. TSIA...

As I've stated before, I've been pretty big on only equipping myself
with what I can legitemately earn - a play style choice and not a
commentary on others play style choices - but as my main approaches 50
it's been becoming abundantly clear the game is no longer really
playable this way. I would, in fact, go so far as to claim an epiphany
of sorts that the game really no longer is reasonably playable after 20
without equipment from zones and mobs well outside my capability
purchased from the bazaar. Indeed, the Experts armor I was so proud of
working towards, the Journeymans armor I was so proud of having
created, and the dreadscale I worked so hard to acquire have all become
laughing-stock gear. Especially frustrating since I haven't even
completed the Experts yet.

This was further punctuated as I recently started playing two of my
alts more regularly - an enchanter and a ranger - and discovered that
even at this low end, the newbie items and the new PoK neutral quest
newbie items were not only considerably superior to anything I had thus
far acquired, but considered pity loot provided by sony to true n00bz
who could not otherwise afford decent gear.

This was not a happy realization on my part, but in the interest of
both keeping myself enjoying the game and keeping my characters at
least marginally desireable to the odd group, I turn to you for
suggestions. What do you do to keep yourself viable without wading into
twink/munchkin territory, or has the twink/munchkin become the game on
Norrath?

Alternatively, I would also be interested in the ramblings of others
who prefer a more RP, struggling type of game experience who have also
come to this conclusion.

Xiphos - Also, realising this is probably not the best forum and
blatantly off topic, anyone here have any experience with development
packages such as Crystal Space?
