How fast do you type? 10 words per minute? How much longer can it possibly
take you to type "please" instead of "plz"?  I certainly don't think it
takes a typing qualification to type normal English sentences.  How is the
word typo less tolerable to you than any other abbreviation that isn't even
in the dictionary?  What is the difference between "typo" and "plz"?
Hypocrisy at its finest, is that not?  "A busy class"?  What class has to do
with being busy I don't understand, and that doesn't give you an excuse on
usenet.
