Well, I guess it's an extension of that canned ramble he has whenever
he goes off about how <whoever> is stalking him even though he has
them killfiled. I could probably find at least a dozen virtually
identical rambles after posts by <whoever> on my machine right now,
and I purged my archives recently.
I mean, we've all heard he has a bunch of people killfiled and that
they still flame him and that he can't understand why and uses that as
an excuse to flame them again while pretending it's some elaborate way
of ignoring them. If he's ignoring them, why does he have to whine
about it over and over and over again?

And this pinhead obsession looks unhealthy. Repressed feelings for an
acupuncturer, you think?
