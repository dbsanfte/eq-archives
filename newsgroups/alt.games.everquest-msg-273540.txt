Interesting.  If they're patching Tasks, I wonder if the "sathirian
protectors" now exist in DL.  I had a task that called for killing
10 of them, but I ran a circuit that I was confident covered the
entire zone (including caves off the edges) within my tracking range,
and found no such mob.  (And it's not listed on Alla, either.)  I asked
a guide, and was told to /bug it, which I did.

Too bad I already ditched that task so I could work on a different one.
