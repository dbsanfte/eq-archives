This is not the place to get into it, but I've read a lot of
the original discussions that went into the creation of
the electoral college system, and a number of studies
on the mathematical dynamics of it, and I'm comfortable
that it's not "broken", it's working exactly as
intended, and that's a *good* thing.

The short form is that simple "nationwide popular vote"
systems are far more likely to produce candidates
who pander only to the majority factions, *period*.
(And for the same reason, they encourage the development
of what we see in a number of European countries,
where the two major "parties" are barely distinguishable
from each other -- as they both aim for the votes of
the largest segment of the population -- leaving no
viable opposition.)

In contrast, electoral college type systems (in which
the winner in certain regions -- states in our system --
takes all the votes for that region) cause the
candidates to have to care about offering something
even to smaller minority factions.

The full implications are even more interesting,
but the point is that an electoral college system
contains valuable checks and balances that a
"popular vote" system does not.
