You really do have too much time on your hands, don't you? You should
invest some of it in education. Why, in either scenario, would you not
want to be able to do the maximum damage to help out your "side" in the
battle?

Unless you're on a PvP server, you're competing against all the MOB's,
Tigger. That's why you want the gear and the DPS. Not for some sort of
fashion show.
