I don't have the expansion and I don't really feel the need to style my 
character, but I can understand anyone that does.

After all, your char is supposed to be an extension of yourself that 
lives someplace virtual, so you might just as well make him look as 
close to the way you want him to look as you can. Or maybe people just 
want to look purdy :)

And think of allt he diversity it creates. Yay!
