You can give no-drop items to quest NPCs. In fact, you're often required
to. What's to stop you from giving a no-drop item to a decaying
skeleton? I'm sure this was thought of in the first five minutes of EQ's
release and prevented. I'm just wondering what the mechanism is that
stops it. Never even occurred to me, but it seem like that would have
been a really cheesy way to get around the problem. Somebody loots a
no-drop item you need, you hand it to the skelly, they immediately kill
it, and loot it.
