I am using the drivers from the manufacturer of my card.  I have these
problems:  the flames and steam showing black panels / PCs and NPCs standing
above the ground (myself included) until you get near them / characters and
object winking in and out of view depending upon the angle/distance from
them.  Some zones I get too much fog when it rains...others I get none.

I can get around the "floating" people by opening/closing the inventory
screen.  It's the same way I get around the problem that blanks out the
border around my screen whenever I zone in certain areas.

I have DX8.0 installed, Elsa Razorx2 32MB GeForce2 card, patched, dx8 and 32
(don't recall the parameter name...was set to 16) set in the eqclient.ini
file.
