Ok there was last year an "exploit" - selling fish rolls or something like
that. I read it posted here and it seemed so boring I kept killing rats etc
etc.

Now when you log on you get a warning about using macros etc. Tech TV just
reported that there is some exploit to make "millions" of plat. This is
automated and sounded part of why so many Jewelers etc are "broken"? My 105
chanter jeweler can't give stuff away - no kidding (Vazaelle). I have no
desire to make millions and get banned. I was curious what others on the
newsgroup think the possible exploit is. Also do not use it!! - when
leveling my alt I grouped with someone who was banned (They made an ogre to
sit in the door to some bank (doh)). Thanks for input.
