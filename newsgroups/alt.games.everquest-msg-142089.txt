Some of the chats are quieter than others. For example eqdruids and druidsgrove 
can be fairly quiet, the first moreso than the latter. They're good sources of 
information when you have a question though, especially regarding druids. The 
other class channels are similar. Eqtraders gets more chat going, but for 
questions about tradeskills it's even better. Never go to the bazaar channels, 
they're worthless in my experience. I initially thought it might be a good place 
to get a price check or something, but it's actually just one more venue for 
people to spam what they're selling (as if bazaar search, ooc, auction, and shout 
weren't enough).
