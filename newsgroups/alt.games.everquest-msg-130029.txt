Not really, once you get your guild outfitted in Sleepers/NToV/Ssra/VT
quality loots with lots of +hp.

Once everybody's hit the soft cap ac is meaningless.

Isn't that the same as the Meditate skill that they share with all casters
and hybrids?  (Hi, warriors don't get block sir!)

One-trick pony, like Victor said, neat.  Of course that's better than
druids, who don't even have one trick, but that's a separate post.

Hah, wizards and mages both have higher burst dps than warriors, which is a
bit more useful on a lot of single-target high-end raids, especially if the
mage is using a pet (not common, but still available).

The problem is that it's usually *not* "a blow or 3", it's usually 4 or 6
(if flurry), or else some BIG double hits.

In otherwords the first person banished to the pit is a cleric, then the
monk tanks?
