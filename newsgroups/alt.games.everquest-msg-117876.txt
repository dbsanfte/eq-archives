Hi everyone:

All through my Wizard's life I've soloed, it's something I enjoy. I've
soloed static spawns such as Cynthia, the Hermit, the Cargo Clockwork and
Icefang. My question is, now that I'm level 57 I'm searching for a static
*blue* mob spawn that doesn't give a faction hit that will totally ruin my
play, for instance I would never have soloed Halv. Can someone give me a few
pointers as to where a blue spawn to a 57 Wizard might be found .. there may
not even be one ..

As always, thanks for your time .. safe hunting ...

Stevie.
