Even so these people evidently take golf way more seriously than you, 
("their own carts") and probably wouldn't be much company.

Of course.

My SK is 51 and wearing auged darkforge. Some of the sentient would be a 
marginal upgrade...and I'm nearly 20 levels up on you. I'm still having 
lots of fun, have little trouble grouping, and MT in LDoNs and elsewhere 
without undue difficulty.

fwiw, I got turned down for a group at level 5 because I didn't want to 
go to pok to get a temp. To this day I don't regret not grouping with 
them.

I never said there weren't asshats in the game. That's no reason to 
pander to them though. :)
