And also a very naive solution that simply doesn't work.

Rather than try to explain why it wouldn't work, I'll invent a
hypothetical situation and you can think about how the same "just
don't use them" solution would apply.

Pretend the UI has a "level up" button that dings you, as well as
increasing your skills appropriately, and next to that, a "gear up"
button, which upgrades you with level appropriate gear.

Now then.  You have no cause to complain about those features being
part of the game, right?  Because you can just avoid using them.  "A
simple solution really."

Now think about why that solution is naive and wouldn't work.

The same thing applies to the PoK books.
