How many comma values do you want for health percentage? I'll code it into
the game next patch.

I.e.

an_orc_pawn_01 has 10000 hps and is classed at 100% health.
At 5000hps he has 50% health.
At 100hps he has 1% health.
At 50hps he has 0.5% health (whether EQ uses standard math rules or just
round it down to 0% is beyond me).
At 10hps he has 0.1% health but there isn't a comma value for health
percentages so it's classed as 0% obviously for simplicity. At this point
the mob still has a positive hitpoint value but is infact at 0% health.

You should really post something worthwile like "i quit", "we need more phat
lewts", "i want everything", "where to hunt for pp", "best duo combo" or
just do as I do and shout out:
