Haven't tested it recently (I'll have to go crushbone) but It was 4 last
time I checked.  I remember when they made the change from as many as
were in the AE to a maximum of 4.  I've seen it mez 5 if you include
yourself.  I don't think it counts the tank if you target them either,
but it's been so long since I used it...

If it has been changed to 36 this will make a huge difference. I'll
definately test it out next time I get the chance, and post on it.
