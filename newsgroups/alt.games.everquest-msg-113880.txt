Wrong and wrong.

The racial XP penalty does not effect AAXP. It effects the total
number of points you need for level.

The regen AAXP stacks with racial regen. If you have 4 points of
racial regen, the AAXP regen adds four more points. There was a bug
where Iksar and Trolls were getting eight additional points of regen
for AAXP for a total of 12.
