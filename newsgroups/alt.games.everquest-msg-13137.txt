Yes I know!  That's why I dunno about it... I'm so damn talkative in the
game, I'll get an entire zone (like Ill Omen for example) in a discussion on
whether or not Jerry was really the evil one in the old "Tom & Jerry"
cartoons (which to this day I still say Jerry is the evil bad guy).
However my guild would probably love it if I did become Marcel Marceau... it
sure would keep their chat window clean. :)
