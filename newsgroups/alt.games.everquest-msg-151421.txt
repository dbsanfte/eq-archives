My tips for safe fall...

Early on, I practiced in Oasis... run up the side of one of the pillars...
then, while still facing the pillar, run BACKWARDS down to the water. By
going backwards, you're not taking as much damage (because you're not going
fast enough to fall too far).

Once the skill-ups began to slow down, I moved to South Karana and the Aviak
tree... the ramp there is perfect for SF training because you can pick the
height you fall from... and by the time you hit a skill of about 60, you can
drop from the 2nd corner without damage, or from the Penthouse to any of the
huts (walk off the platform right next to a hanging chain) and then down to
the ground.

WARNING... check your weight before jumping... if you're loaded down with
loot and overweight, you take a lot more damage than normal.
