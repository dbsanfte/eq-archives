I've been told that I'm off base here and that I should just accept
things the way they are, but it just doesn't make any sense.

I have a level 18 wizard, and although I enjoy playing him immensely,
there is one downside that has been there the whole time: wizards
don't get to loot.  All the melee and hybrid chars are right there
when the mob falls, and even when they pause for a moment out of
common courtesy, I don't have enough time to get to the loot before
one of them decides no one else wants it this turn.

What I would like to hear is any suggestion anyone might have to deal
with this diplomatically.  I don't want to be greedy or piss anyone
off, but I would like an equal share in the loot without having to
spout off in group. Though I would be justified in voicing my
complaint, no matter how diplomatic, I always look like a whiner.  The
simple fact is I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BRING IT UP AT ALL!

Any advice from experienced players would be greatly appreciated.
