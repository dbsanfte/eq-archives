Seems to be this way, or atleast i have experienced it this way;
If all group members are within the limits (1.5*lowest lvl in group) all get
xp for every kill
according to division rules. But if you are unbalanced, lets say a group
consisting of members ranging
from lvl 10 to 16, if you kill a mob lt. blue or above con. all but the lvl
10 gets xp. but if you kill a
mob green to the lvl 16 but above green to the lvl 10 then the lvl 10 will
get xp share and the lvl 16
 ofcourse not, as it is green to him.
Just my experience, take it for what you want :)
