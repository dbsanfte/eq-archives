Yep, Octane workstation, connected to a server with 8 processors.  I think 
at this point I've used IRIX more than any other *nix.

Heh.  It's taken me quite a while to get used to a computer that doesn't 
randomly bluescreen for no apparent reason, and that I don't have to 
reboot just to install software. :)
