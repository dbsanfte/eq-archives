Worst case:  L9 Half-Elf Paladin with no points into wis and no
wis or mana items has ((65 / 5) + 2) * 9 = 135 mana.
Any Paladin that can afford to use bandages is likely to have
over 200 mana, quite possibly over 300 if a twink, at L9.
But this isn't particularly important, if you have the bandages
BW is ok for now (at L9), because you don't have Meditate yet.

L15 Paladin can easily have 350-450 mana (less if Half-Elf, more
if twinked or devoted to questing and using the bazaar to maximize
gear).  The minimum, assuming Half Elf with no gear (and even the
newbie quest gear gives some wis/mana):  ((65 / 5) + 2) * 15 = 225

Hmmm, let's see here... If I walk my bicycle to the halfway point of
my trip, cycling the reminder will be much faster than cycling the
entire trip, of course this ignores the time it took me to walk
halfway.

Bind Wounds is so nearly worthless for priests and Paladins that I
simply cannot imagine wasting my time with it for those four classes.

I don't know about you, but my Paladin found it far more effective to
manage his mana so that he could cast Cure Poison and/or Cure Disease
as necessary when the fight ended.  Aside:  Any L20+ Paladin I see
casting Yaulp when there's no Cleric in the group or when fighting
casters is immediately classified as terminally clueless.
