This is what scares me about LDoN, I love the concept of a group adventure,
but the minute you put a timer on it my stress levels rise (hey - I am a
nutcase), and heck, I play games to unwind not stress out. For those who
play on Fironia whatchmacallit (the roleplay server) do you still find that
LDoN groups are dedicated to beating the time limit for maximum reward or do
peeps kinda chill out a bit and pretend it is a actual adventure?
