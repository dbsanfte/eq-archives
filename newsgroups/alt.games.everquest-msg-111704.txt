hmmmm... why didn't they update the game to keep up with the
competition?  Could it have been because they were putting all their
resources into the "new game" while ignoring the one that everyone loved
and letting it far behind the curve?  This in combination with a lack of
understanding of the community by new ownership is what brought AW
down.  I see something similar going on now I think.

but don't take my word for it, ask some AW'ers, and I mean AW'ers that
would know like those that were deeply into the game(scenarios and such)

perfect description of the RR arena, that wasn't the real AW, sorry you
missed it, the real AW was about skill... and(don't miss this one now)

sure the basic structure is the same but strategies change and

no, there's just no reason to bring all the crap up, you just want to
deflect the discussion now, if you want to believe you have "won" on
this point then go ahead and believe that.
