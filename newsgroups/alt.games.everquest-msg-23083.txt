    Spell effect, yes. Although "Hug" off those quest dolls in the Plane of
Mischief also seems like fun. As far as fun spells, check this one out
(lucky mages):

    Free root seems nice. It could be used for easy aggro control in groups,
without using a spell slot (and without requiring you to sit and swap, a
luxury you may not have if aggro control is needed). I can't see it being
used for a druid rotting, though - I imagine the casting time is too long to
get it off "when needed".

    That would require her to re-do the quests. You lose the old necklace
when you get the next one in the series, like the Coldain rings. The Tunare
Disciple's symbol has a nice effect, though - a self-only 15 DR/PR buff that
stacks against other resist buffs.

    You don't need no skinny finger-wriggler who blows his nose on his
armour to get a fine drink! You're a cleric - you can summon drink just
fine. ;-)

    The exact name of the beverage is "Brell's Blessed Stout". Which also
refers to the dwarf cleric drinking it, coincidentally.
