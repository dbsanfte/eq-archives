Information on the subject is available on the Internet,
though as usual, you have to be careful to weed out the
unreputable sites.  Am I going to do that legwork for you?
No.

Also, dog and cat intelligence depends heavily on which
breeds you're talking about.

However, even to the layperson, it should be fairly obvious.
Dogs are trained in literally hundreds of incredibly advanced
ways. Seeing eye dogs, hunting, fetching, herding, sniffing
for bombs, for people, for controlled substances, protection,
sledding, police work, competition (such as navigation of
obstacle courses), etc. etc. etc.

Also, feel free to look up information on the anatomy of a
cat brain vs. a dog brain.

Honestly, though, this subject is beginning to disinterest
me.  If you want to think cats are more intelligent with
some ridiculous logic like, "The cat is smarter because it
does what it wants, not what you want," be my guest.  Knock
yourself out.  Your cats are Einstein and dogs are morons
because some exhibit a few odd behaviors like enjoying the
cat's litterbox.

It's amazing how much weight people put into tiny bits of
personal anecdotal evidence.  Critical thinking skills are
becoming such a rare thing...  *sigh*
