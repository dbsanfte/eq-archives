You can play EQ for free, by downloading a free Client from Sony and
playing on their new freebie server, which is far better than some
Quasi-legal option mentioned above, IMO.

Not sure why the hell you think sending someone to a server which has a
completely different ruleset, player base and culture is going to let
someone know if EQ is for them, is beyond me.

http://escapetonorrath.station.sony.com/ is free, is legitimate and doesn't
cost a single penny (other than your bandwidth) to try out.  I recommend
giving it a go.  Limits you to level 10 but will at least give you a feel
for the game, the user interface, and the style.
