Yes, it is considered a dungeon, indoors, can't bind (yourself) there, and
exp bonus, not one of the high tier 'unused/dangerous' bonuses a'la Kedge or
the Hole, but it is there.

Oddly, I found the spiders and orcs easier than the spikes and fishes, yeah,
they're social, but spiders are easy to single pull and break, as are orcs,
and for that matter spikes.  Back when I was 40 or so, I was there with a 36
enchanter and a 38 warrior, kept enchanter on his toes with "inc lots"
regularly on spiders, but chewed through them still, but if we killed a
spike the enchanter had to slow it or it ate my mana too fast on healing
since the spikes seemed to have higher/faster melee than the "a crystal
crawler" spiders, the spiderlings were green and the warrior just soloed
them while pulling, the webmasters were better exp, but hit just slightly
harder and less common spawns.

Then we made a train from hell, moved to the queen room (fully popped) and
were medding to break it when a spider wandered down, agroed the enchanter,
and pulled the room on us.  I ran out of mana to evac, so we ran like hell
to the zone out, when we zoned back in about 15 minutes later, the
monk/cleric duoing the geonids were still shouting about how massive a train
that was, apparently took them that long to clean it up.
