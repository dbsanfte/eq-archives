Does no one play the original game anymore?  I have been away
from the game for about a year and just started playing again.  I
just loaded the original game and started a new character to get
back into the swing of things, but Norrath has certainly changed
since I left.  After being distracted for a while by the new user
interface changes and game play changes (not having to retrieve
corpse for the first nine levels, among others), I finally began
noticing that there is really no one around any more.  After
leaving Misty Thicket, I first went to HHP to check out the orc
action and found no one camping the orcs.  So I go to West
commons thinking to get some action there.  Empty except for
people around the druid rings.  Head into East Commons thinking
surely there's some orc killing going on here -- nope.  Both orc
camps fully spawned and ignored.  Same in N Ro -- Dervs are
unmolested.  Oasis has a few people in it, but most are soloing
crocs or being killed by Dry Bones Skellys.  Can't get a group to
save my life.  End up soloing lions and spiders and bears, oh my.
I understand why the N Ro EC tunnel is empty, but man is it
lonely in there.

Where is everyone?
