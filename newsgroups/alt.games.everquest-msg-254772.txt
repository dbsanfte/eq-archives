Whoa!  Seriously?  There's NPCs that I can attack without risking
getting killed?  Maybe I should send my wizard there to train up
his little-used (but sometimes still needed) melee skills.

I try sometimes to do some melee when I'm confident that the battle
is going well enough.  But (a) if it's going that well, typically
it's over before I get to swing more than a couple times, and (b)
even if one battle is going well, I usually want to be medding so
I'll have more mana for the next mob.

But it's really annoying to be running across a zone to meet up
with a group or something, and some annoying green or light blue
mob agros on me, and I have to spend mana knocking it down instead
because it takes forever to smack it with my awesome melee skills.
So I'd love to find a place to raise them up.  (And apropos of
another thread, I'm saving my training points for Spell Research.)

p.s.: I assume Katta in general is KOS to Iksar?  Or is it safe,
like most of Luclin?  Else it could be a way for my monk to skill
up his 2HB, too.  Heck, maybe I should start with that, and figure
if the NPCs aren't really safe to whack on I can feign death until
they calm down. :-)
