You have to have an ISP that allows you to access Newsgroups first off...
Most of em I've seen do, although when I was using my college ISP I had a
VERY limited selection of newsgroups...

Provided your ISP provides it, you just run through the Outlook Express set
up and go to Newsgroups and search for this one.

Then just subscribe...

That's prolly not as helpful as you need, I'm sorry...  I'm not very good at
explaining things like this...  Just check with you ISP to see if you get
the ngs first...  :o)
