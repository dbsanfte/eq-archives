Thank you for your kind invitation, but my sexual proclivities are not
fodder for this newsgroup.  Poor Connie would have a fit if we started
discussing that.  Still nice of you to extend the invite.

As for your pitiful argument, the answer is quite simple.  Rules is
rules.  I pay the same as you, I play by the same rules as you.  What
you are proposing is that anyone can do as they please so long as they
pay.  I for one would not play such a game and neither would a large
percentage of paying customers.  VI recognizing that has set down some
rules which ALL players must follow.  Those who can't follow them can
expect issues to arise and must accept full blame for any such issues as
they could have avoided them by following the rules.

Assuming by "<thread over>" you meant you were running off with your
tail 'tween your legs, cause it ain't over just cause you say so:  buh
bye now!
