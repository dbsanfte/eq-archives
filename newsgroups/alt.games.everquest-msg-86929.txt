Fantastic point, and one that I don't think many people realize. EQ is/has
become a time dependent game. Everything you have is pretty much dependent
upon the amount of time you have spent playing the game. Want to be uber?
Just devote your life to EQ for a few months and you will be. There are some
'skills' you learn adventuring, and I use that term rather loosely. But
mostly your character is a reflection of the days you have whiled away
infront of a computer screen
