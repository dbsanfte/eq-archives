Yes, but erudite SKs have _style_ :)

Actually, you probably won't be KOS in most of Erudin (just dubious).
You will  be KOS in the various temples and Erudin palace though.

Going by memory, you'll be KOS in Qeynos (but not the sewers), Halas,
Surefall Glade, High Hold, Rivervale, Oggok, Grobb, most of Faydwer and
Cabilis.

You won't be KOS in Qeynos Sewers, Freeport, Neriak or the Overthere.
Um, better make that 'most of Neriak' - I think some of the foreign
quarter NPCs won't like you, and the ghoul guardians of the SK & necro
guild in the 3rd gate KOS all non-inkies. But if/when you can get past
them, you should be able to train in the guild itself.

I have no idea about Velious.
