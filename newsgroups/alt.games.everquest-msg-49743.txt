Hiya All,

First off, I would like to introduce myself, I play a half elf bard ( just
dinged 31! WOOT ) on the seventh hammer server - I have been watching this
group with interest over the past few months (call me a lurker if you like),
and have found your information very helpful, which is why I decided to post
you all this question:

Is it just me or do all guilds suck?

This is my story...

During my newbie years I loved the game - the fighting unknown mobs, the
comraderie with other 'noobs', the willingness to loose that little bit of
exp if it meant your new found friends would make it out alive. In short,
everything.

As time went by, you gain more levels, get more armour, find new mobs and
quests. Finally you get to the point where you know what items you want, you
know how to get it, but you along with your usual group of friends just isnt
quite enough to get the kill without a major CR. What do you do?

My first thought was to join a guild - "yeah a guild is what I need to help
me camp those nasty-<insert nasty mob here>, and in return I am willing to
spend my precious leveling time to help them do something!" So without
further a do, I find myself enlisted (wont bad mouth them just in case they
are watching ;o).

A few months down the line I am begining to wonder why I had bothered. There
never seems to be enough people to make a full group, let alone a group of
my level, on all at the same times as me (admitedly, I live in UK without
the great playerbase the US has, but I cant be the only european player who
has this problem? and I also play sometimes late at night, and during the
day makes no difference). Other people in the guild almost twice my level
are asking me 'what does this do, where does that drop, where do I hand this
in for that item, etc'. When I ask for help on quests, no one seems to know
anything. On the very few times I have asked the guild for a hand to do
something I cant handle alone, or for advice, guess what? I get absolutely
no response. And from what I hear, my guild isnt the only one like that....

Does this mean I just hve to get everyone on my friends list to play at the
same time just so I can get a little help? THE GAME USED TO BE SOME MUCH
FUN, UNTIL EVERYONE BECAME SO CONCERNED ABOUT UBER ITEMS AND EXPERIENCE THAT
THEY CANT SPARE THE TIME OR ENERGY TO HELP OUT SOMEONE ELSE!

Two of my online friends are quiting EQ for the very same reasons, but I am
not ready to throw in the towel just yet. Therefore I am hoping someone
reading this, has the same feelings as me, and is willing to help do
something about it...

I want to start my own guild, but with a few differences in the general
setup.

1.    NO LEVEL RESTRICTIONS!
2.    Mainly, but not exclusively european time players.
3.    The Guild lives EQ together! hunts together, plays together, works
together - this has to be the most important aspect of the guild, so that no
matter what class or race, you always have a group you can turn to whenever
you need it.

If anyones interested in helping me set something like this up, or even if
you cant and think this is a good idea, or just the rantings of someone who
should just give it up, please post back - ALL feedback is greatly
appreciated. It will be the answers from you guys that decide whether I
stick it out, and make it to raid material, or just chuck in the towel - my
fate rests in your hands )

PS - apologies for the long post, and if you have managed to get this far
through it, thank you for the time taken to at least listen )
