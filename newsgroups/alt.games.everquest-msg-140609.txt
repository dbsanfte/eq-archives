Latest Change is a the ability for porting classes to now port to Luclin
from Norrath as well as much needed added ports to Luclin zones..but if you
left around Luclin time you won't truly appreciate this.

Boats, where broken have a Gnome on the dock, hail him tell him where you
want to go and he'll zone you there instead of the boat ride..Be Warned, you
will zone onto the Docks of said location.

When the Bazaar opened on Bristlebane it topped 500 people, it's down to the
high 300's now.
