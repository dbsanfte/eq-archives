Of course. I'm not sure I follow why your making this point.

Sure. But it highlights the error of using the definition of human being 
in a semantic argument, that is the error you made.

I should hope not.

Biologicaly, the classification of species comes down to genetics. A 
zygote has a complete set of genes. A biologist would look at the 
various stages and say: that's a human zygote, or a human fetus, or a 
human infant, or a human adult, or even a human corpse.

After all a deceased human is still biologically a human. Fortunately 
you can't kill them, so we don't have to argue about whether or not 
doing so is murder. (unless they start rising as undead...although I've 
seen some really well done law&order episodes that highlight the problem 
of even defining what a 'dead human being' is.)

The legal system merely decides the stages at which we have various 
rights, be it the right to live, or the right to vote, it doesn't really 
decide when something is human. Biologists have that covered. (And even 
there, the amount of genetic deviation allowed before a human is a 
nonhuman a bit grey.)

I wish you were right. I doubt it strongly though.

You can't be serious. You just made the same mistake you made the first 
go-round.

The current regional legality of various stage abortions is not relevant 
to the semantics. And it is fallacious to invoke it.

Consider the case of capital punishment. It is also the willful 
execution of one human being by another. A great many people beleive it 
is -murder-.

You can't disprove their opinion by stating they are "factually 
incorrect", that "Capital punishment is legal, therefore it cannot be 
murder." Obviously someone who expresses the opinion that capital 
punishment is wrong, and that its murder is making the implicit 
statement that it should be illegal too.

No there wasn't, see the argument above -- and below. :)

And unfinished. What is your conclusion? How did you get there?

This 'proof' makes absolutely no sense at all. For you to move anywhere 
would presuppose that we take r as a premise. And surely you are not 
going to suggest we take "termination is legal" as an assumed blanket 
truth!!

Perhaps you meant to phrase r as 'termination of fetuses is legal' (lets 
call this rprime). And for this more limited case I'd have to agree that 
it was in fact true, and that would, on the surface, start to get you 
somewhere. 

However, I would find the introduction of rprime to be completely 
unacceptable. Why? Because your pushing the cart before the horse.

rprime doesn't stand on its own. *Assuming fetuses aren't human in the 
first place* is necessary to the truth of rprime. Thus rprime derives 
from the assumption: ~p.

Do you seriously think otherwise? If the law recognized fetuses as human 
beings (with all the protections and rights that entails) do you really 
think it would be legal to terminate them?

Of course NOT!

So rprime derives from ~p. But the OP asserted p. And once again we have 
a fundamental disagreement on the truth and ultimately the semantics of 
p.

And again, we're at the crux of it. The truth of p depends on the 
definition of "human beings". 

You can't prove or disprove anything about his statement by invoking the 
very definition that is being contested. And invoking definitions that 
are derived from the contested definition is the same mistake just 
further down the line.

**Obviously: someone who thinks terminating fetuses is murder, intends 
to extend the consequences of that definition to include making 
terminating fetuses illegal** And this dovetails nicely with my capital 
punishment argument way back at the top.

It is fallacious to try to manufacture this loophole.

---------------------
An aside:
For completeness, and if you wish to further this discussion. I should 
add that my assertion p->q is incomplete. It should be: p<->q or p->q & 
q->p. (There were some logical artifacts that cropped up by not 
specifying both directions.)

It was really more of hypothetical clinging. I never actually said you 
clung to it. But indeed, somone still clinging to it would be a twit.
