We posted here originally with the best of intentions.  Some received
us very nicely, others decided that it was there obligation to put us
in our place.  We thanked those that welcomed us greatly and defended
ourselves against those who attacked us.  We weren't dumping shit
anywhere till we were graced with the assinine responses of a few
select individuals.  I know you're trying to continue your crusade
against web forums, but I fail to see how you came to the conclusion
that the majority of web forum posters are children.  Are you telling
me this is not the case on the newsgroup?
