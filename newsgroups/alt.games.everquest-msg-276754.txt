I swung past my Tribute Master last night and tried offering my
Conqueror's Cape (attuned but unaugmented).  She wouldn't take it.
I was also offered nothing for it from an NPC vendor.

Of course, it's possible that that Cape couldn't be sold or given
as tribute even before I attuned it.  (I have to admit I never
tried. :-)  If someone out there has an unattuned Conqueror's Cape,
could you please do the experiment to see if a merchant and/or your
tribute master is willing to make an offer for it?  If they ARE,
then it will be pretty clear that the act of attuning the item is
what makes it unable to be sold or tributed, just like any other
No Drop item.
