If you're presuming good terrain for the duo you have to compare it
to good terrain for the soloer.  Anyplace the Wiz could quad the
Paladin would be a hindrance.

Irrelevant.  Solo wiz doesn't need healing.

Play-style issue, but important none-the-less.

Heh, _any_ duo is better than a solo Paladin (high level Paladin
with uber gear and lots of AAs in KC basement excepted).  But, if
it's down to "can kill tougher mobs than a solo Paladin", you still
have to come up with zones/mobs that make this better for the Wiz
than soloing.

As for Rogue+Wizard, I didn't think of agro-kiting until after I hit
send.  I always hated chasing mobs as a melee so I never spent any
time fear- or agro-kiting, which must be why I didn't think of it
right away.  Comes down to play-style, but I imagine most Rogues are
more than willing to chase a mob around poking it in the back.
