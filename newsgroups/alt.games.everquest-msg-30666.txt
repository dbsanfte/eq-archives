Ask your group to leave kills for you, or to hand you a few pricier things that
drop (pearls and higher gems, fine steel, etc.) to make up for coin you're not
getting.  (Actually the gems are great for monks, since they never loot,
either.)  If they don't...bitch at 'em.  :)

That, or when they need a heal sometime, you can say, "Sorry, oom, I had to sit
and furiously right click on that last frog corpse so I could try and recoup the
cost of some of the symbols I've been laying on you."

Okay, maybe the second is just screwing yourself, but you could always just
scare 'em with it. :)
