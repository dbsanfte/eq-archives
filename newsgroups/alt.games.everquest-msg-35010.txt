Weeell, a yellow mob generally has similar hit points to a blue mob of
the same type - and it doesn't matter how much harder it would hit you
since the point is to have it *not* hit you - you're nibbling away at it
from a distance. The problem with kiting the tougher mobs is one of
resists - may need to cast a couple of times to get snare or root or a
dot or whatever to stick. I often kite reds solo, but only when they're
low-reds, I know I can handle them, and there's nothing easier of
whatever I'm hunting nearby. This is because I would probably be doing
this for quest drops rather than xp grinding - anything you need to kite
around for 20min isn't xp-efficient, and I'm just as likely to get some
frost giant toes from this blue giant over here as I am for the yellow
one over there.
