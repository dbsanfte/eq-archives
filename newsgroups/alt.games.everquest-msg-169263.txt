}When I was studying creative writing, we were taught that to imply an
}accent, speech impediment, regional dialect, etc. that we should add an
}_occasional_ misspelling, usually at the end of a phrase.

}For example, Rhett Butler's dialog might be written as: "I don't think
}that's exactly role playing, Suh." rather than "Ah don' thin thas zackly
}role playin', Suh."

} A little goes a long way. You get the "flavor" without becoming
}unintelligible. Works pretty good in EQ as well, I think.

Hey.  That's bloody clever.  Thanks for the tip. :)
