 Umm.. right.

 I have a broadband connection and I rarely, if ever go LD. Is it just you or
is the entire zone/game/server going down. If it's not the server, it's you
and your connection. I have a GOOD connection. There are ways however, I can
make MY connection bad on my end such as poor equipment, incorrect settings
in the TCP/IP section of Network Properties and/or registry settings.
 
 I seriously suggest you troubleshoot your own hardware setup before you go
off half-cocked to the CEO of Sony (who in my opinion will never see your 
letter let alone read it).

 Your LD is not their fault. When it IS their fault they know it and respond
quickly and efficiently. I've seen it happen many, many times.

 It is, and they have.

 Huh? GMs are PAID employees, Guides are volunteers.
