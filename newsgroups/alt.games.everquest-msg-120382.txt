I don't condone the act of 'taking advantage' of people.  I have no
problem if, when given the option, people pay what they think a port
is worth.

Or, if the porters in question keep asking for donations, and the
people donating keep giving say, 5 plat a pop, the price will drop
from the 'common knowledge' norm of 10 plat.  Same result.

Yes, the point seems to be that you would rather attack me than attack
my point.

You are taking advantage of people who are ASKING you to take
advantage of them.  I'm sorry, I don't have a lot of sympathy for
people who lay down in front of a door with WELCOME written on their
chest and then complain about people wiping their feet on them.

The fact that I've played a porting class for better than 3 years
though might give me some insight into the matter of Porting Do's And
