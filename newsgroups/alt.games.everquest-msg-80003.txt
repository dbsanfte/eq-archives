They say wizards get locate corpse....

They say a necro can stand chatting, while his pet wipes out city guards...

They say SK's need Wis...

They say bards should use weapons in their hands when traveliing across
lands, instead of drums etc to run fast. (if your runnin through and not
intending to fight.. would u rather stand and try fighting, or run too fast
to be catched?)

I haven't looked in my book for a long long time, but their inaccuracies
extend from cover to cover.
