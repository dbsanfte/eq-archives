    One of the best methods of PL'ing in the game today is partially
restricted by this bit of code, so I doubt they'll change it. Which is too
bad - it works on raid XP too, and it's annoying to lose raid XP because a
rogue went to pull a corpse or the puller is pulling from far away before
moving the raid.
