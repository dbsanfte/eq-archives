    Pretty much would have to.  I deleted 
a level 9 Half Elf ranger because of the
way she looked in leather.  I figured it
didn't bode very well for the future.  
When she sat down a (juvenile, I assume)
party member exclaimed "Yellow panties!"
He was crass, but truthful.
   OTOH, I really liked how my Barn Shaman
looked in leather, sans the stupid polar 
bear head hat.  And banded looked good
on her too.
