    Even some top guilds roll on items - look at Afterlife's points system
for an example. If we had two enchanters with similar raid attendance who
both needed C3, the easiest way to award it without causing any hurt
feelings would be a roll.

    I felt for my guild leader the other night. We went to Cazic Thule at
the end of the raid day, and we got one of those Lizard Bone Earrings:

Wt 0.10. +2 AC, +10 Sta, +6 Agi, +6 Dex, +5 Cha, +5 vsPos, +5 vsDis, +70 HP,
+35 Mana, all/all.

    There wasn't a single person on the raid who wouldn't be improved by
that earring. EVERYONE sent a tell asking for it. I'd never seen my guild
leader struggle so much with deciding who got loot. Eventually he awarded it
to a warrior who's at everything we do and who hadn't got a drop in recent
memory. Immediately, a full group's worth of people had to port out because
"it was getting late". Every time the PH for the earring mob popped and it
wasn't the named, more people "got tired". I'd never seen my guild act so
openly greedy about a drop before. I wish we'd rolled, because then there
would have been no hard feelings.

    James

PS. Yes, we're going back to try and get more. It's droppable now, too,
level limit of 50 - can you imagine what this would sell for in EC?
