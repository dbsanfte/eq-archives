Well from what we can tell, the spell or possible item involves crafting 9
high-leved tradeskill items (meaning they are not considered "trivial" by
people in the 150+ tradeskill ranges) and offering them to the gods. (These
items were discovered by translating 9 books written in languages like
orcish. combine and gnoll. I did two myself and took almost 2 hours each.)

That is a VERY simplified overview. No one has completed it yet due to the
tradeskill complexity. Check out eqtraders.com for more info.
