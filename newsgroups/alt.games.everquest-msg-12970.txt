Usually when I go out I actually go out.
If i'm playing EQ im playing EQ. I dont have any inhibitions about telling
people that I play the game but I'm not as addicted as some. Sure some
weekends I spend about 20 hours playing but others I dont :)
I run a guild and am actively leveling my charachter. It is possible to play
EQ and have fun in RL too! And have a job! Dont know about time for wife and
kids though, i'll deal with that hurdle when I come to it.
