Surely verant log this stuff? It would of course take some time for one of
them to go through the logs and verify that there is a mistake. I daresay a
lot (not all) of these complaints are mistaken. This makes it unappealing
for verant to chek into these claims.

The way this is handled by many organizations, is to pay them to check it
out for you, and if it turns out your claim is correct, then the money is
refunded. This keeps verant happy as they arnt wasting their money chasing
false claims, and keeps the customer happy, as server mistakes (such as
yours) can be checked out promptly.

To simply say "we know of no bugs" and then refuse to look into it... well
you can imagine how long an employee programmer with that attitude would
last.
