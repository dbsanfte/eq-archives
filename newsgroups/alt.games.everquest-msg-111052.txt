SoW takes 8 seconds to cast and recycle.  So, best case, 200 seconds to cast
25 sows, I would think 225 to 250 seconds is more likely.

25x8=200

You recover mana at 1 per tick, while standing.  If you sat down at all
during the casting, then your mana regen rate is higher.

200/6=33

So in the time it takes you to cast 25 sows, you recover a minimum of 33
mana if you are standing the whole time.  More likely around 40 mana, given
a small delay for you to react between casts, but basically, enough mana for
one more cast.

32*(2+124/5)=857.6 or 858 mana

858+33=891

Do you have any mana gear at all that you are wearing?

What did you specialize in?  Even if not Alteration, if your Alteration
specialization is at 50, it has a chance to fire off, and will reduce the
mana cost when it does.  I have found no information regarding how much the
mana reduction is, or what the chance of the specialization working is.  All
I have found regarding specialization says that if the specialization roll
is successful, your chance of fizzling will be lower, and the mana cost will
be lower.  The skill level in the particular specialization will affect the
likelihood of it's success, and will affect the amount of mana reduction.  I
would guess that, at most, specialization would account for one, or two more
casts of SoW, but I don't know.

A better test of the formula would be to have a character under level 30, so
there is no specialization coming into play, and with no mana gear, or at
least documented mana gear.
