The beastlord pet is not summoned by spell, its
created via an ability.  This ability is attained
without training at level 9, never seems to
fail or go up in skill.

"casting" a pet is a click ability, with a timer,
costs no mana, recycles immediately, so you
could chain the little buggers if you wanted to...
and I think at low levels this may be a viable
strategy, especially with a rooting partner.

Interestingly, when your pet is up, you have a
buff icon that reads "Summon pet" (or somethign
like that) and looks like a summon spell.  Click
on that and the pet goes away immediately.  No
questing for your earthen boots or other subterfuge,
when the pet needs to go away, it goes.

At level 9, my summoned pet was cyan, did max 8 damage,
was easily defeated by a mage water pet with a mage summoned
staff... which isn't exactly a fair comparison, but the mage
was about to log and we tested what we could.

Cast a special spell on it (seem to get one each spell level)
and it says "ding" and its level changes.  At level 9,
the one cast I got in before sever went down brought
pet to even con.

In addition to that, I have Inner Fire to buff it, and a special
pet only heal similar to the mage and necro pet only heals.
