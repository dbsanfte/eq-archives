Of course that was 3-4 hitpoints at level *1*, naked.  Granted, that may be
where you spend the majority of your time on this server.

That margin gets bigger with every level too, obviously.

This also ignores the benefits that warriors have from level 1, such as 4%
melee mitigation (I assume in effect on Discord) and no penalty to
attack/movement for low health.

Have you ever used track on a level 1 ranger at a skill of 1?  If you see
them on track, you can *see* them.  :P

Yeah, you showed that it was only a 50% advantage at level 1 instead of a
100% advantage.  The ranger is sure to win now!  :P

Everybody is playing at "base" ability.  There's no twinking, most of the
best twink stuff doesn't even exist on that server.  Hell, even the good old
world stuff will probably never be achieved.  Warriors at low levels with
nobody having any equipment advantage would actually be fairly tough to
kill, particularly by another melee class.  The true over-achievers of
Discord that actually acquire armor can expand on this advantage (right up
til they get ganked by the level 25).

It had nothing to do with ranger defense being capped at 200 and the need
for jolt, which were the "pre-Kunark ranger issues".  It's most definitely
your failing that you thought any discussion of low levels would somehow
reference stuff that never became an issue til the 40s.
