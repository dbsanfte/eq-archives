You would prefer that once someone from a family is president, nobody else
from that family can ever be president again?  Rather bizarre and arbitrary
limitation isn't it?

Goodbye FDR, was nice knowing you, the only president liked enough to be
elected for three terms who actually inspired the two-term limit.

> Out of curiosity was #6 also a moron?

Without him, we wouldn't (necessarily) have many of the western states.

The Monroe Doctrine, widely regarded as one of the more important aspects of
American history was authored by him (among others) under the president that
preceded him (can you guess that president's name?).

He helped push for the creation of the Smithsonian Institution as a national
scientific intelligence respository.

He was in favor of rights and protections for blacks and indians.

Coincidentally, he wasn't a popular president and lost in his attempt for a
second term because of those convictions.

So yeah, utter moron.  He didn't base his convictions on polls and such,
preferring instead to comprehend the meaning of the word "conviction" and
stick to what he believed.

Also coincidentally, and the reason you should have at least heard of the
guy, is that he was the *other* president that won without receiving a
majority of the popular vote.

Thank you.  =)
