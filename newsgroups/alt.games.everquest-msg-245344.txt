Well ok, then rogues are the only ones that offer something unique that is
detrimental to a mob.  And even then, they need someone else to help them do it.
Monks do have their FD on the run, single target pac, mend.  Warriors do have
their higher HP, AC, defensive abilities.  But higher AC, HP, defensive
abilities isn't really detrimental to the mob.  So monks and warriors in the
same boat by that reasoning.
