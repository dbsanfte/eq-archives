>>And I seriously want to know how one goes about "breaking" a CD anyway.<<

It's difficult, but not impossible. I'm in the military, and we have a parts
catalog that comes monthly on CD. When we get the new one, we have to
destroy the old one. I got to the point where I could snap one on the first
try, usually shooting a shard or two half-way across the office.

Bottom line, you have to *really* try to break a CD. It's virtually
impossible to "accidentally" break one.
