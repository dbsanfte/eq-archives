Yup, that about covers it.

Bah.  I started new on Atlantic nearly 4 years in.  Of course, that server
was one of the first to get the first publish of vet rewards so I was able
to sell a few for several million gold each.

I want *that* house----right there, the big one kthx.

Heard they fixed that.  After I canceled for the last time anyway so who
cares =)

Yeah, while PvP might not be EQ's forte, 2 necro's squaring off in EQ PvP
are pretty much down to a battle of skill in the fight.  I know that between
EQ on a 56k and in recent months on cable modem, main diff I notice is zone
times.  In UO PvP now days, if you're anything less than T3/Cable/xDSL - 'u
r fuxxored' as they say in UO.  They should just have players go to some
free speed test like DSL reports, take turns running the speed tests, then
the Granddaddybadass PvPer is the one that tests highest.  Save alot of
monthly subscription fees that way heh.

Nah. Nuh uh.

Not a problem, I wear everything I need at the time, packs take care of the
rest.  Really my bank just holds the piles and piles of plat that would
otherwise encumber me *cough*

Unlike UO and some other games, getting around in EQ doesn't really suck -
ie. sights to see, things to kill, people to talk to.  YMMV.

You're too used to gate/recall/mark - which was the other extreme from EQ.
So was I.  EQ will break you of that YIELD, YIELD I SAY!

Made it 40 levels now and looking back; some guy came in the first time I
went looking for Starsine.  I came back later that evening and killed the
bastard and got me ToV.  I guess that's supposed to be camped.  My only camp
in 40 levels - didn't leave me feeling shafted, again YMMV.

Amen.  Beta'd EQ on a P233 MMX with 64MB of ram and a 8mb Voodoo2.  Ugh.

I was an Ultima series fan.  I like crazy Dick Garriot, always have.  But
yeah, the latest UO extravaganza has them rehashing all of MacFarlanes
art/model work from UO:2 and releasing it as an expansion to UO.  Black
Thorn's revenge or some such stupid shit.  Crazy what competition and
desperation will drive a company too.

Definitely.  With the free game time these games offer, you really can't go
too wrong with the box purchase and that free month to try it out.
