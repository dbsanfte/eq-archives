Actually im on a p2 400, tnt 16 meg ram card, 575 meg ram, windows 98
and I don't have these graphical problems or slow down but I DON'T
have useumbra=false. The thing is with an nvidia card and a pentium
proc umbra being on is probably helping you, it does for me a lot
especially in freeport where clipping kind of does not work.

I have all the models on, social animations on, textures set to low
(biggest ram saver right there, far more than turning off luclin
models for me), perm swap of 700 meg on a seperate partition which is
fat 16 (better for swapping.. only file there anyway) vcache max of 32
meg since more than that really won't help with EQ but win 98 will use
a ton of sys ram for vcache during EQ otherwise eating ups  system
memory and possibly making you run out of memory addresses.
texture cache is on.

Oh, one other thing, I DON'T have the new old world textures installed
that came with Luclin. If you do, it could be part of the reason for
slowdown in north freeport since those textures are definately larger
and more detailed.

If you already have 512 meg of ram with your system, throwing more meg
of ram at it is kind of a waste. With my system above I have pretty
much the same performance at 575 meg as I had at 384 meg of ram,
though cacheman shows that during EQ I do indeed use all 575 meg of
system ram (or often only about up to 565 meg of it and 485 meg of use
of my 700 meg swap file)

Get this:

Cacheman.

It has some very nice presets for things you may have not thought of,
such as the max vcache setting. As I say above its also useful because
after you are done playing EQ you can pull it up and see exactly how
high your use of your swap file was during EQ as well as your system
ram use to try and gauge. I was always using ALL of my system ram at
384 meg of it while at 575 meg I often only use 560 or so in EQ when
done playing which means throwing more ram at it would not help and
for me otherthings are probably my bottleneck such as my graphics card
and cpu (probably in that order)

If you have Luclin, a good way to test if Umbra is working for you to
is to go to a zone like shadow haven WITHOUT the UseUmbra=False line
in your eqclient.ini. Turn clipping all the way up, you should be
fairly graphically lagged in that zone even with a great system ( I
get 3 - 4 FPS with clipping all the way up there.. ouch) Then go into
a room with a door and four walls (and a roof) If its working, as it
does for me, your graphics lag will disappear. I go from 4 fps to my
regular 30 or so I'm at with clipping all the way down and not very
many polygons around me. I then had the line UseUmbra=false in my
eqclient.ini (after getting all the way out of EQ and restarting it),
THEN with clipping all the way up I had 4 fps in that room also
because its STILL rendering the stuff outside the room which I can't
see. I then made some tests in areas like freeport even with clipping
out at my regular quarter of an inch or less and still notice a marked
improvement since they patched umbra so it works (specifically DPVS,
and the file of the same name)
