From an anthropological viewpoint, there have been civilizations in the past
that have decayed, and lost their original religions, reverting into a more
primitive form of society than before (Easter Island IRL, for example).  The
Barbarians forgetting their link to the Marr Twins may be just such a
Norrathian version.

The Tribunal is also known as the Six Hammers....even though a Tribunal by
definition has Three members, for some reason the Norrathian Tribunal has
Six members, with a rumored shaddowy Seventh member who dispenses vigilante
style justice, and is followed by the Rogues of the White Rose.  To my
knowledge, no one knows the names of the Six/Seven members of the Tribunal.

On servers with alignments (Sullon Zek and Firionia Vie), the Tribunal is
listed as Neutral (not Good nor Evil).  [On Sullon Zek, Barbarian warriors
and shamen can choose to follow Mithaniel Marr and be Good....don't know
about FV server.]

Most Shamen (Ogres, Trolls, Kunarkians...err....Iksar, I mean) are Evil.
That explains the 'evil' based spells.  It just happens that the 'neutral'
Barbarian shamen can also use them.  Maybe the Tribunal has the mentality
that the 'ends justify the means' when it comes to dispensing Justice?

On the Combine Empire.....my impression is that it wasn't just Barbarians,
but all Norrathian races combined into one unified, peaceful empire.  Either
an incredibly powerful War among the Empire's Wizards, or political factions
and strife (led by Dark Elves??) caused the Combine Empire to collapse
(accounts I have read and stories from NPC's in-game seem to paint a fuzzy
and somewhat contradictory story.)

The Wizards seem to have lost much power after the collapse of the Combine
Empire, and Wizard spell research in-game seems to be an effort on their
part to regain some of that lost knowledge.
