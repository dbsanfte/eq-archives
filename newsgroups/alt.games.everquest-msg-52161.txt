Head to highpass for the orcs. You'll get snapped up for a group in a
heartbeat. Couple levels later you can head in to the keep which will
take you to 30 easily if you want to hang around that long.

Nice alternate: Get a good damage dealing partner and go to OoT and hunt
gargoyles. Great money.

Unrest would be a nice option, inside the mansion. Again, you'd likely
get a group easily. That place usually draws a lot of players and
clerics are always in demand.

Same with Najena, but that's most always BYOG. But with all the undead
in the entry part of the zone, you might even be able to solo there.

Of course, there's always Lake of Ill Manners if you can figure out how
to shut off all the chat channels except /group.
