FWIW, I did stop using it.  I started learning how to cross the zone by
myself - and found that it wasn't that bad if you knew where you were going
and didn't stop.  Only once did I have to DA to get across.

All told I used it about a dozen times, each time justifying it to myself
with "I'm not getting XP or loot from doing this."  In the end the
rationalization fell through because, ultimately, I *was* using it to get XP
and loot - getting across SG without dying enabled me to get access to
places where I could get those things.

I also subsequently read that SOE is aware of the exploit but doesn't even
consider it worth a warning.  So, on the list of EQ crimes, using this
exploit is ranked quite close to the bottom, something not even worth so
much as the raise of a bored eyebrow from a Guide.

I still stopped using it.
