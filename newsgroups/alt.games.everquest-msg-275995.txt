You're right, and I understood that he meant that I should cancel my
subscription, let it run out, then start it up again with the same EQ2

But what happened was that Sony started in a situation where if I did
nothing, I kept paying them money every month, and ended up in a
situation where if I did nothing, my account vanished.  That's a bad
move.
