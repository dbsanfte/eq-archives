Bitterness would be hyperbole.  EQ is a leisure activity, not
the sort of thing to become bitter over.  Anoyance, that fades
with time and is overwhelmed by memories of the good times, is
far more accurate.  Have your 60ish Ranger tell me how awesome
PoV has been since 55 though and you'll quickly find your way
onto my "don't group with this horse's ass" list.  Pickup
group tanking makes me cranky at times, and I don't feel bad
about it.  :-p
