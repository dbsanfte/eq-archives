Question's been answered, I'll answer a few others that you haven't asked
yet.

No, they aren't pets.  They will not fight for you.  They cannot be killed
by melee or targeted spells (I believe they can be killed with AE spells)
and there's no reason to kill them besides their annoying
flap-flap-flap-flapping (argh!!) noise.

Supposedly (haven't seen it backed up anywhere yet, but I haven't been
looking) they help wizards with mana regen, and is supposed to cut down on
fizzles.

Regarding fizzles it's ironic because wizards need the conjuration skill to
summon them and my level 40 wizard had a ZERO conjuration skill until SoL
came out because wizards don't USE conjuration (I believe there's a summon
wisp spell that human and erudites might use...not sure, I haven't
remembered to go buy the spell yet).  So it took me 4 full bars of mana due
to fizzles to summon a creature that'll help with mana regen and fizzles. :p

Familiars zone with you and camp with you.  They do not aggro monsters so
except for the annoying sound there's no reason a group will require you to
kill him (he follows no /pet commands except /pet get lost).  As of a few
patches ago they still suicide if you go invis, though that's supposedly a
bug.
