I've got a radeon 9700 pro, and when I got it it's drivers (the latest
catalyst) were messing eq up something terrible, weird things like when
autorun was on, you couldn't use arrow keys, as well as when you pressed
buttons it was like you were holding shift as well, so you would get the
shift - button of whatever you were pushing.. anyways, I was wondering if
anyone who remembers this bug can tell me if its safe to get the newest
drivers now, as I would definately would like to have them running.
