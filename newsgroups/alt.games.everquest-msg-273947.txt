Well thank goodness terms like that are something of the past - I certainly
don't find the term endearing.

Back to the OP's point though - I agree with his suspension for a few days.
Is arguing with a GM going to change their minds?  Not likely - If anything
I think it reinforced that they made the right decision.

You may ask what if it happened to me....well should it ever happen and I
get banned for a few days I would take my medicine...I wouldn't post in a
bunch of  newsgroups not directly related to the game I'm playing looking
for sympathy.

I think you have to put some thought into what you post in-game given the
differing ages of players.
