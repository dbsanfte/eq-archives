Nobody drowns in EQ unless you go too deep or leave the keyboard. No
matter how bad your swim skill is. At level 17 you can get your skill up
to around 85 which should be fine. I'd suggest, if you are going to get
it yourself, that you just go swim around in a safe area until you max
it out, then ride the boat to near the zone, jump off, swim after the
boat until you hit the zone line and dive. You'll find it. I've swum all
over OoT and you'll be surprised at how shallow the water is. Just make
sure you have a /corpse hotkey set up.

An easier method, of course, is to purchase a coffin and ask a friendly
necro to summon it to dry land for you.
