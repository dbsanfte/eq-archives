Now -that- is a very interesting question indeed.

I remember from my psychology class a very inteesting result.  I can't 
remember the details of the experient, other than it all seemed to check 
out and made sense to me.  The upshot was, that whereas we would normally 
think that we plan all our actions in advance, ie, if I want to move my 
arm 10 degrees, first I would think somewhere in my lttle brain "move arm 
10 degreees starboard", this doesn't in fact happen.  And what our brain 
very cleverly does, is largely a matter of acting first, and then 
rationalizing our actions to us so quickly that we -think- we planned it.

Which doesn't mean that we -can't- plan actions in advance.  Just that the 
majority of what we do was -not- consciously planned.

I still don't think even that is a valid excuse for profanity in 
specifically declared "no profanity" venues.  Yes, it is possible that you 
have a hard-coded "swear in these circumstances" response in you 
somewhere.  But if that is the case, it is -your- responsibility to either 
change your programming, or suffer the consequences.  And if you cannot 
or will not change your programming, I'm sorry to say that EQ just may not 
be the game for you.

It's really easy.  Just convince yourself that "fuck" is properly spelled 
"fudge" or "fooey", and similarly for "shoot", "darn", etc.  Sure, you'll 
sound goofy, and people will laugh at you, but would you rather have 
soulmarks?  Didn't think so.
