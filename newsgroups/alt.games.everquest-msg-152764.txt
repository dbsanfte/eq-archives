Hum,
First, your thinking is a little screwed, which seems to show a bit of
immaturity.
EQ is for entertainment.  When you go to the movies you spend, what about
$7.50 to $8.00 for 2 hours of entertainment.  You pay your cable bill for
movies and TV shows and spend time watching and being entertained.

How many hours do you spend playing EQ being entertained and enjoying your
time? I spend quite a bit of time on EQ and enjoy it.  It helps me unwind
after a days work.  Sure, I could be entertained by watching TV, but gaming
is a bit different, in that I'm interacting.  Sure I could play a free
internet based game, but their usually not as involving and robust as EQ.

The cost of this entertainment is very marginal for the time and pleasure
you get for having the pleasure to play EQ.  Paying for the service allows
them to maintain the servers and the technical expertise needed to keep the
game operational.

Just the short time I've played has shown major changes to the user
interface and other add ons which you probably wouldn't get if the service
was free.  They continually upgrade and add enhancements.  These changes are
due to the fact that they are able to pay for experienced programmers out of
the monthly fees the received from us gamers.  Thus this increases our
enjoyment of the game.

Yes, I disagree with your statement.  It is more than fair paying for this
service.  I'm just surprised they have upped it to $20.00 a month.  Which, I
would still pay.

Anyway, this message caught my attention and I felt like adding my 2-cents.
I can only say that you have the right not to play the game and a right to
your opinion, as do I.
