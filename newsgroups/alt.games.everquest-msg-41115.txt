What kind of sick piece of shit comes to a NG hiding under some anonymous
tag like the fucking pussy that he his to harp on the tragedy of 10's of
thousands of human lives?

Yeah...you're real fucking cool there buddy...keep hiding behind that
keyboard you little pussy...

I'll show you giggling...how bout you email me your address so I can post it
up on the net along with your little message?

Let's see you giggle after that...when several hundred thousand people show
up on your doorstep to take a piece of your ass home in a small jar as a
souvenier...

Flamewar over a world wide tragedy...get a fucking life...crawl back under
your rock...maybe the next time you guys have a civil disobedience we won't
be there to save your pathetic asses.

Fucking moron...
