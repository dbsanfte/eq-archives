I believe him when he says that he was just trying to flatter Strom.  I
don't think Lott is a racist.  However, his statement may have done an
immense amount of damage to the Republican party.  In two years, every
democrat will replay that line, every "unbiased" news agency will find a way
to work it into a major story or ten.  One can not afford to be so careless
at that stage of the game.  I think it would be best for the party if he
were to fall on his sword.
