Bullshit. Homophobe is a euphemism made popular and used by 
homosexuals in order to label anyone not lining up behind them a 
bigot. It was intentionally implemented in order to terrorize the politically 
correct into keeping their mouth's shut. When comparing those strictly
heterosexual with those who aren't, there is no aspect of misnomer
through the use of homosexual, unless you are worried about sheep 
lovers feeling abused by inclusion.

And as far as Alberta is concerned, those several experts can take
a leap.

And Alberta could give a fuck about any sympathy, especially from the pricks 
in Ontario who through another Liberal asshole, [ PET ] raped the West for
billions of dollars with the NEP.

There has been no establishment of any constitutional  law making the denial
of same sex marriages in contravention of the constitution. There has been a
provincial decision which means jack. Provincial courts do not establish 
constitutional law but merely interpret it rightly or wrongly.

As a matter of fact I do, and if you want to provide a link to it I'll
be happy to read it and point out exactly where it's bullshit. I've
yet to see a politically motivated report which can't be destroyed,
so I have no fear whatever with respect to this one..if it exists.


>Enlightening you should be no problem, if you open your eyes.  

Gee, it must be hard being the beacon of reason. Maybe you should stick
your attitude up your ass. If you don't want to do that, I could find you a 
hamster.

I admire your stellar character, it only took me 10 fucking years to pay off 
mine instead of defaulting. And to use how liars and cheats can beat the 
system in order to support your position is pretty lame.

 the government could not have gone after my spouse's assets.
>Get the picture?

I assume you mean your boyfriend as you didn't have a spouse. But that aside, 
no one could see the picture you are presenting because it's bullshit. Yes 
there are some instances when the government would save money by allowing
same sex marriages, but the exceptions do not negate the overall result which
would be diminished revenue for the government and increased cost to the 
private sector.

I never said ' every last law should benefit every Canadian '.  But there's
a hell of a difference between passing a law benefiting 4% of the population 
at the expense of the rest with no compelling reason or benefit except
to make the higher purpose people and politically correct feel all warm and 
fuzzy inside.

>Have the balls to voice your opinion, man!

Keep your mind off my balls and stay on topic. I think the notion of same sex 
marriages is nuts. I think it is simply one more step in the ' normalization ' 
of homosexuality. I don't believe it's in the best interest of society in the
long run to legalize it. I also believe given the direction western societies
are headed, it is inevitable. Time will tell whether it was a good idea or 
not. Having said that, I could really give a fat rat's ass as we're going down 
the toilet anyway as a result of more important problems.
