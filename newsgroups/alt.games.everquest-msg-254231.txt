The tutorial is a very good thing.  I have taken 3 different toons thru it.
A few hours of time = lvl 4-5 plus a nice charm in a slot that will stay
empty if you skip it.
If you stay till lvl 5 you will see greens, but most will be dark blue.
Great xp and you are not stuck in your home newbie zone.

The only real problem with it is the background noise when talking to the
NPCs.  I have to turn the volume down so I never hear the voice telling me
what to do, (no big loss, I just read the text).
