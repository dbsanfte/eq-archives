Tonight my ranger hit level 9. I had already purchased my first heal spell
and used it a few times before visiting my guild to train points in spell
skills, including 1 point in channelling.
As soon as I'd trained my points, I healed myself again & got two messages :
you have become better at alteration (10)
you have become better at channelling (29) !!

OK I was aware that putting 1 point in a skill at level 9 would actually put
9 points in that skill, but can anyone tell me why channelling started at
28?
