He's on the roleplay server and named his character 'Datatroi'?
*boggle*

I think he's on the FV server for the wrong reason, too. (I remember
it as a very, very quiet place) You should get him to try your server
and show him the ropes, see if he likes it better there. You two might
also want to read up on some of the quests on Allakhazam, and maybe
reconsider him playing a warrior.

He's right, there is no plot to the game, at least not unless you make
it yourself. I play it because I like the world and the friends I have
in it, not to 'complete/win' the game one day.

If the game doesn't suit him after he's gotten a bit further, I'd just
accept that.
