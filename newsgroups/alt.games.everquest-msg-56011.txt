Looking through this, you will see that while the original everquest does
not mention win2k, both expansions do.  I would wager that this has more to
do with the fact that win2k did not exist when eq originally came out than
anything else.  So, from this, we could surmise that Win2k is supported.  I
can't answer for what the Trilogy box says on it, but being as it includes
both expansions, then according to the website, Win2k is supported.
