Venril Sathir (UBI)

Playable on: by both UBI and SOE customers
Population: low
Player range: mainly high level
Play style: mainly raiding
Economy: cheap, with notable high end spiking by a few
CS: comparatively very good
Guild progression: see http://www.lodan.co.uk/guilds.htm
Unofficial messageboard: www.venrilsathir.com

Note that if you transfer to VS you will become a UBISoft customer
and lose access to, among other things, certain billing options, use of
the access all areas pass, value added services from SOE, and the
ability to transfer back off the server. Starting a new character there
leaves you as a SOE customer and will not subject you to these
problems, but any characters you make there will not be moveable
to a SOE server.
