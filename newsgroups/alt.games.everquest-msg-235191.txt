And, by the way...if the name wasn't in violation of any rules, the GM
wouldn't change it. The simple fact that the names were OBVIOUS,
BLATANT violations of specific terms in the policy were why I
petitioned them. No "bad mood" needed. The names were against the
rules, they got petitioned, and they fucking well deserved it. The
rules are there. Follow them or get the fuck off their servers.
