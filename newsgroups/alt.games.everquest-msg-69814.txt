really?  It only took about 2 minutes for them to reactivate mine.  I played
for about a month and quit so I could finish school.  6 months later when
classes were done all it took was one phone call.  Hell, I wasn't even on
hold for more than 30 seconds.  Everyone slams their customer support, so
either I called on a good day, or I actually got ahold of someone who knows
what they are doing!
