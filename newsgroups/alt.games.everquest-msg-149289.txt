IMHO, not being in an ubAr guild or anything, Paladins are your stun
class.  Backup healing is damned nice, but get a caster mob and get a
couple of pallies beating on it with their various stun spells can
save way, way more damage than they can heal.

At high levels, no arrows = moron ranger.  At lower levels, it's just
aggro management.  Don't get aggro and beat on the mob.  Also, if you
got a ranger, he should probably be the one doing the snaring rather
than the druid.  That's not a biggie though.
