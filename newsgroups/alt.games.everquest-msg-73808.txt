If you are the main puller, "YOU" dictate which mob the group fights.
Also make sure that everyone in the group understands that all casting
mobs are to be killed first.

The next time you get in a group make sure all the other members make
a hotkey with the macro "/assist <main tank's name>". Then make SURE
they use it! When you reach the mid-upper levels this is a MUST.
Everyone needs to learn how to do this early on in their career.

As you noticed you couldn't "jump out of melee". If you have agro (the
mobs beating on you), and no one else is attacking it or building agro
by healing you, then you are most likely going to take a beat down
whether you stand or run. As you level up you will see more and more
instances where some members of your group (or even yourself) will get
hit so hard and so fast they die before anyone can help them. Most of
these deaths can be avoided by simply going over a plan with the group
before starting to fight.

I would suggest making a hot-key that quickly tells the group you are
in trouble...

/g Help %t is killing me
/g All attack %t (if you are group leader or main tank)
/g All assist me (if you are group leader or main tank)

Cheers
