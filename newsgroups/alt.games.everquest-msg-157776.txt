Personally, I wouldn't be part of any guild with an authoritarian tone, but
that's just me.  Maybe it's because I get enough of that at work to last me
several lifetimes.

Anyways, that being said, that is the way your guild operates.  It had it's
own tone and culture before you joined.  Take it with a grain of salt and
keep going.  If you find that ruins the game for you, then move elsewhere.
