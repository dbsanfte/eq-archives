Let's not get carried away. Admittedly we may be talking several
months, or maybe years, worth of "character building", that's not much
different than saying "going to the movies and paying $15 dollars for
two people to see a 2 hour movie is an incredible waste of time", or
"going to a decent restaurant and paying $50 for a nice meal is an
incredible waste of time".

EQ is a game, a form of entertainment, and some would even call the
playing of it an incredible waste of time. But I'd walk away from it
to something else if that something else was better than what EQ
offers me. And I would not consider my 3 years with EQ to be a waste
of time, I'd call it months and months and months of great
entertainment that finally was surpassed by something better (which
has yet to be seen).
