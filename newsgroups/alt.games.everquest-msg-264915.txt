In one of Bob Perez's recent posts he posted the irony in the fact that the
beta was running much better on an ATI card than an nVidia even though
nVidia is a partner in the game. Given that the game is now on track for a
November 8th release I am wondering what the status is on this. Is there any
new word from Sony or have there been improvements on nVidia performance?

I am going to buy the game, no doubt even if only just to try it, but am
planning to hold off until a few post-release patches are out. However being
an nVidia user I am willing to hold off a lot longer until I hear it runs as
well or at least around as good as an ATI card regardless of fixes/content
patches.

Thanks for any info.
