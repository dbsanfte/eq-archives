Oh, that'll be simple. Check back later for exact quotes. ;)

"flaming asshole" .. Since when? About the only time I've really ever flamed
someone was when Avenger got on my nerves a few too many times.

And why is it that every time someone disagrees with you, (or any troll,
idiot, etc.) we're all of a sudden "defending" Bizbee, DT, and Lokari? Just
because we don't see it your way does NOT mean we completely agree with
their views. That hardly makes us "lackeys" of Bizbee, it just means we
don't agree with you.

Yes, Bizbee flames. Yes, he's an asshole at times. But you know what? He's a
hell of a lot more RIGHT about MANY things than the people he flames, which
almost ALWAYS start the flaming. Maybe I've missed something, but when I
read this newsgroup I search for posts containing my name, and posts by
Bizbee. I've been reading every single one of his posts for the last year
and a half, and I've yet to see him START flaming someone. *Maybe* in a few
cases with older people like Red Celt, Mad Bomma, P&H, etc., he started the
flaming, but in my opinion, they had kept it going.

I've seen a few helpful posts from you. I've seen several flames from you.
So far, the flames outnumber the helpful posts. If you want to keep to a
point of not getting flamed, try to reduce the flames.
