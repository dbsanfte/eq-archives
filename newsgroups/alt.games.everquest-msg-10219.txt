Perhaps he missed the bit about where someone died and appointed
you emperor of the newsgroup.

It's one thing to kindly ask people to post elsewhere and say
"please" while you're doing it.

It's another thing entirely to call someone a "fuckwit" for
choosing not to abide by your personal decree.

That's the same sort of behavior that you're (with some
justification) blasting Bizbee for.
