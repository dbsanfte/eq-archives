Part of the problem really, is that they gave Evil territory where they
started out with clear control over their own newbie areas, then made Good
and Neutral fight for control against each other for their newbie areas, and
arranged things so that Neutral had the advantage in most of these contested
newbie zones.

That made it so that Evil could level unmolested fairly quickly, while Good
and Neutral would be fighting each other from the start.  This had the
effect of making the Neutral team combat-hardened, and the Good team wearied
and wiped off the map from Neutral's genocidal pogroms.

If they reset the server, they'd need to give the Good team some of the same
privileges as the other two teams....such as home cities and racial
languages exclusively their own.  Either that, or make only two teams.

I think Sullon would have worked much much better if Verant had waited until
after Luclin before they released it.
