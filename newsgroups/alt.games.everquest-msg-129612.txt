Killing 1000+ palestinians is meaningless, as it is out of context.  You
keep leaving one detail out.  Isreal is killing enemy combatants.  That is
not only justified, Mr. Sharon would be negligent in not doing so.

Oh, but there is.  That's part of war.  People die in war, that's why it
sucks.  Are you saying one party in a war should do nothing to defend
itself?

Every time Isreal tries to stop, they find the Palestinians only step up the

I don't ignore the deaths.  It's as tragic as the germans who lost their
lives in WWII.  Still doesn't make it wrong.
