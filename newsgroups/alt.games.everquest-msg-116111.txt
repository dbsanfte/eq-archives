Except they weren't, I asked them if they were doing reavers, and since the
first reply I got was "sorry, what did you say?  I was blinded", I said, "I
guess so", one of my druid friends was planning on bringing some people out
there to get her a reaver (the zone was empty 15 minutes earlier when I came
in, and I suggested that she come get a reaver), after talking to the farmer
for a few minutes, I mentioned that, which was immediately replied by "If
your friend wants, we'll hold the first reaver for her to buy for 15k".
They were NOT farming it for a friend/twink/guildie, they were simply doing
it for the money.

So you're saying that you can keep all of the spawns in the arena area
killed before repops?  Including the PoZ and prophets?

Ripping people off by selling epic MQs is about as low as you can get IMO.

But you aren't farming them for pure profit, you're there for exp(which it
really isn't worth doing for) and to help your friends.
