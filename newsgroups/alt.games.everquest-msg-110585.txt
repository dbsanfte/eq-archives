Go for regen. Being a int caster your bind wounds skill is capped
at 100 I believe. Which means you only get 25 hp per bandage.
You would be better off regening and meditating I think. Plus the
regen is on all the time, sitting, medding, running, casting. All the time.
regen3 is 30 hit points every minute.
