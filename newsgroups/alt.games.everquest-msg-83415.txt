How about casting thunder strike on a high elf, and knocking them off
a ledge so that they die from falling damage.

How about running alongside the boat in OOT, with lev on, and pk'ing
people sitting inside the boat.

Or for that matter, just beating someone down on the boat using melee,
since spells can't be cast.

Evil is taking out fully healed high elves with one cast of Ice comet.

Evil is pk'ing as a chanter, with the victim mezzed, and waiting for
your next nuke, with nothing they can do about it.

Evil is camping out while the chanter that mezzed you screws around
and casts every debuff they have before actually doing any damage.

Getting double backstabbed while medding is evil.
