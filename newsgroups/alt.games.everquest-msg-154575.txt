Early estimates are 53 dead including a lot of Australians, but worse still,
a lot of dirt poor Balinese staff members.

For the geographically impaired Bali is an island paradise which sticks out
like a sore thumb in the Indonesian Archipeligo because they predominantly
Hindu when the rest of Indonesia is predominatly Moslem. The Balinese are
some of the friendliest, nicest, down to earth people you will meet. This
has long made them a thorn in the side of the ratbag set amongst the
Indonesion Moslems as they cast such a strong contrast against their own
socially fucked up shit holes.

I think this is one of the uglier attacks of lates, because it wasn't just
motivated by a hatred of Westerners but also by sheer jealousy of the well
functioning Balinese society whose only "crime" has to show by example how
ugly other surrounding islands were <socially>.
