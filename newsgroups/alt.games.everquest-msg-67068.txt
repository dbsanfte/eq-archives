Bind is weird as it is primarily an out of character issue relating to
their corpse recovery and death system. You wan to have something to
discourage dying, xp penalty is one thing the binding system another.

The issue then becomes one of balance. Casters get more and easier
bind...I have no problem with that. I'd like to see that distinction
remain. So giving rangers bind immediately means you'd have to give all 
hybrids bind for balance..and suddenly all bar rogue, mnk, warrior and
possibly (I dont know the class well enough) get bind..thats silly to
exclude those. Now having a binding person able to bind you in a very
useful loc in city zones or the tranist areas (NK gypsies etc)  can be
tactically useful and that should remain player driven.

I would suggest that either the system has to remain as is, or there
should be guildhouse located casters who will bind on request to those on
sufficient faction much lie the free unending heals given by the
Leatherfoot medic in Nek Forest. You locate the 'NPC bind' casters only in
cities, only in the depths to discourage dying a little (OK one zone line
worth tops) and so someone can move about city by city if they arent a
caster yet casters keep that gate/death/evac advantage for having the
spell. May stop people plaguing casters for a basic out of character
spell, and allowing the really have good justification for charging for
casting a sensible amont for a 'tactical' bind eg those Ikkys wanting
binds on zone edges so the medding priest has to wander to them etc.

SoW used to be at lvl 39 for rangers we got it down to 30 so Im happy to
consider myself lucky. Frankly you dont have to move that far as a ranger
to lvl 10, unless you are a tourist (like me) and even then binding is
easy enough to get that SoW loses a lot of the appeal. 30 is fine.
