Well I managed to buy EQ (Kunark) from my recently opened branch of Game
today in the UK.

I think I was pretty lucky though as I had previously emailed most of the
online shops (electronic boutique, simply games , gameplay etc) and either
got an email saying their supplier could no longer get this item, or their
site already labelled it as no longer available.

All is not lost though as if you check on www.dvdboxoffice.com you will find
the Everquest Trilogy for ï¿½25 pounds in their game section. Even better is
that this price included p&p to the UK - which takes about one and a half
weeks in my experience ordering DVD's from them. They're a good company -
although it can take them a while to get items in stock occasionally -
although that might just be because a lot of the DVDs I order aren't so easy
to get hold of.

I would have gone with this but I couldn't wait lol - so now I'll have to
buy velious seperately. ;)
