conspiratorially whispered:

>It's rather curious, though...Lonely Guy and Hotwizard have the same
>quick-posting habits, and the coincidence that Lonely Guy disappears right
>before Hotwizard takes the stage is pretty big...BUT, you notice that
>their attitudes are different?  Lonely Guy was sort of...upbeat and
>self-apologetic, often saying things like "I know I also did some things
>wrong, BUT..." (and a bit of a spazz).  Hotwizard is openly insulting of
>folks from the start.  If it's a sock puppet, it's someone who is very,
>erm (how to say it...), flexible in their personality. Border-line
>multiple-personalities, so to speak.
