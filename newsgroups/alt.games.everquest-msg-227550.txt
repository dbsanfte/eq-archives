Well, technically, as the founder, he does have the power to do that.  He 
can always petition SoE to get back the GL tag, and then do anything 
within the power of a GL.

There is one valid reason for doing this, if he wants to form a new 
guild, he first has to remove the old guild, a person cannot be the 
founder of more than one existing guild.  That being said, when the issue 
came up with my previous guild, a GM was petitioned, a meeting time 
arranged, and the GM created a new guild, deleted the old, gave the new 
guild the same name, but with a different founder, and all was good.  The 
old GL was now free to form a new guild, the old guild still existed.
