Since you have posed many questions let me answer them one at a time:

Not to prevent players from prevailing, to prevent them from using
exploits.  Prevailing through accepted tactics is fine, its the
exploiting that is wrong and should rightfully be stopped.  So the point
is two fold, one to stop the current exploitation and two to act as a
deterrent to future exploiters.

Sorry, but enforcing game integrity is not rigging anything against
anyone.  The more important question would be how many would be stupid
enough to pay a monthly fee to play a game that has been exploited?  How
about one where the developers didn't care about exploiters enough to
stop them from exploiting the biggest encounters in the game?

No, games are designed to be played.  Beating a game is about as silly
as you can get, no joy, no fun, end of game.  Playing on the other hand
has unlimited potential for enjoyment.  You should try it some time.

You can not beat the game in any fashion, but even overlooking that
foolishness, you can not do anything legitimately if you have to use an
exploit to do it.  The two are not compatible in any way shape or form
and any act carried out via exploit is rendered illegitimate by the very
exploit that allows you to carry it out.  For someone claiming to be
smarter than a programmer you sure don't do very well with logic, a
skill programmers know a bit about.  Personally I think an eye for an
eye is the answer, cheat and be cheated, exploit and be exploited.  The
good will bought with the real players of the game by perma killing
exploiters would make good fiscal sense and best of all act as a
deterrent to others stupid enough to think that exploitation is a means
to "winning".  Sure those who want to use exploits to "beat" the game
will quit, but with them gone civilized folks might be encouraged to
play the game more and at the least those that already do will enjoy it
more.
