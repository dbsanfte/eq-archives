It's definitely not impossible to train.  I logged in the other day, with
the intent of getting the last shark I needed for that shark killing quest
on the Isle of Refuge.  As I stood on one of the rocks in the middle of the
lake, someone ran up with a shark on their tail.  I noticed the encounter
was not locked, but before I could do anything like cast a heal on them,
they died, and the shark started attacking me.  I killed it to finish my
quest.  It was quite convenient. :-)

I've also trained people accidently.
