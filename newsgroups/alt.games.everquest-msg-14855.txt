Speak for yourself, bucko.

}Mass.,  MA, and Massachusetts are pronounced identically.

I say, "Boston, Mass" all the time.  Strangely, everyone knows exactly 
what I'm talking about.  There is no way to argue that Mass. is an 
acronym, so give it up.

}CIA is not pronounced Central Intelligence Agency.
}NASA is Not pronounce National Aeronautics and Space Administration)}

I was recently a member of the National Association of Graduate and 
Professional Students (NAGPS).  This is pronounced "nags".

The Executive Council of my school's Grad Student Association has an 
ex-officio member whose title is Graduate Student Assistant to the Dean 
and Chancellor (GSADAC).  We also pronounce this, it sounds like "gadack".

}tx, Tks, thks, thx, and Thanks are pronounced Identically.

Maybe in your world.  I would pronounce all five of those differently from 
each other.  One of them is actually a word expressing gratitude.  The 
other four are particles, possibly arguably abbreviations, but to me they 
express gratitude with a connotation of impatience and/or disrespect.

This is a role-playing game.  Can you really imagine Gandalf saying "Tks"?
Bilbo would probably throw him right out of the hobbithole before he even 
got to explain about his destiny.
