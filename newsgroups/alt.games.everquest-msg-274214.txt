If you want to play a game with ultimate class balance I suggest EQ2 ( a sad 
name since the games are so different ). Choose a fighter mage priest or 
scout and you will be the exact same thing as any of the four classes no 
matter the different choices you make along the way. Any healer can heal as 
well as any other -any fighter can fight or tank as well as any other - it 
just doesnt matter. The game has 4 classes and it just doesnt matter how 
many choices you get along the way you will never heal better - fight 
better - etc as any other in the same class.

Class balance just sucks - imo - ive seen it in EQ2 and if thats what you 
want go there. In EQ1 just play the class you enjoy and if you are into - 
must get to the end game ( which doesnt exist - the end game is a moving 
target ) - roll a class you "think" is the most coveted.

From what Ive seen of the edges of the end game - or I should say the edges 
of high end game - know your class, play it well and you will be welcomed 
anywhere.

This is from the perspective of a Druid - a human Druid at that. I know my 
role and play it well and dont have a problem at high levels.
