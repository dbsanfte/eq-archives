clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.



Job.35
[1] Elihu spake moreover, and said,
[2] Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is
more than God's?
[3] For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit
shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
[4] I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
[5] Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher
than thou.
[6] If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions
be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
[7] If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of
thine hand?
[8] Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may
profit the son of man.
[9] By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to
cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.



[10] But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;



[11] Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser
than the fowls of heaven?



[12] There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil
men.



[13] Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.



[14] Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before
him; therefore trust thou in him.



[15] But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he
knoweth it not in great extremity:



[16] Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without
knowledge.



Job.36
[1] Elihu also proceeded, and said,



[2] Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on
God's behalf.



[3] I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to
my Maker.



[4] For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge
is with thee.



[5] Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength
and wisdom.



[6] He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.



[7] He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they
on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.



[8] And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;



[9] Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have
exceeded.



[10] He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they
return from iniquity.



[11] If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity,
and their years in pleasures.



[12] But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall
die without knowledge.



[13] But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth
them.



[14] They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.



[15] He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in
oppression.



[16] Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad
place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy
table should be full of fatness.



[17] But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and
justice take hold on thee.



[18] Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke:
then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.



[19] Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
strength.



[20] Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.



[21] Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than
affliction.



[22] Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?



[23] Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought
iniquity?



[24] Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.



[25] Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.



[26] Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of
his years be searched out.



[27] For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according
to the vapour thereof:



[28] Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.



[29] Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of
his tabernacle?



[30] Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the
sea.



[31] For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.



[32] With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by
the cloud that cometh betwixt.



[33] The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the
vapour.



Job.37
[1] At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.



[2] Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of
his mouth.



[3] He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends
of the earth.



[4] After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.



[5] God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which
we cannot comprehend.



[6] For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small
rain, and to the great rain of his strength.



[7] He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.



[8] Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.



[9] Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.



[10] By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is
straitened.
