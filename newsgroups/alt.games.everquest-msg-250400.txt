Which you can still very much do, last time I checked. If the 
fact that your friends don't need you like they used to irks you 
to that extent, you picked the wrong class. The job description 
of a Druid extends well beyond "port whore", you know.

How come we never hear Shaman complain about JBoots and TBoots 
being a SoW nerf? Hell, how come Wizards don't bitch about the 
PoK books anywhere as much as Druids do, being a much more 
limited character class?

So are you in principle opposed to Alchemy and Tinkering as well? 
They also remove a lot of the utility Druids (and, somewhat, 
Magicians) provide.

The funny thing is, I dislike the PoK books and I'm on the record 
saying as much, but not because they make Druid ports less 
useful; in fact, Druid ports have always been part of the 
problem: I'd much rather they were all self-only, to help 
preserve the size of the world (that's a different topic, though, 
and I'm well aware that EQ has evolved in a different direction).
