I'm running with Win ME, Athlon 1.0 ghz, 512mb memory, ATI 9600,
Directx 9.0c.  I have virtually all the settings turned to maximum
performance.  Works ok if there are very few players around.  In the
cities it turns into a slide show (maybe one screen update every 2-3
seconds) and is pretty much unplayable.  However, zoning actually
seems pretty reasonable, at least no worse than zoning in EQ1.

Based on the comments of lots of folks here I have 1 gb of memory on
order and am hoping that it makes the cities at least playable, or
else I guess I'm back to EQ 1 until I get the plat for a new comp :(
