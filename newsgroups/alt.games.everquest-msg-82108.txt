Ok.. read this post and all the replies to it at this time.
Here is my 2cp's

I have a 29 Bst now and I have played pet class for a long time.. I
also have a 53 mage. I know how to control pet, been doing it a LONG
time with mage... but as one poster said, warder are just plain dumb
and dense.

I don't like using the /pet attack command with warder.. I never know
where he is gonna run off to and what he is gonna attack..
He seems to attack the nearest mob.. regardless of what I have
targeted when I issuse attack command.
GAWD... can't imagine how it will be in a zone crowded with mobs like
Dreadlands
... 
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
TAUNTING.... MASTER!
OMG... he's taunting the whole FRIGGING zone!!

Warder is CONSTANTLY switching targets.. each new mob that hits him or
me.. he turns and attacks it.
I find my myself pounding on the back off hotkey till I am blue in the
face.  I am constantly using warder like a enchanter pet.. especially
if its more then one mob.. I let warder choose the target and I just
hit assist.

I have pissed a few chanters myself.. but just don't wanna kill off
warder, he is just poweful for me to do that.
He is stronger then mage or necro pet of same level.
And with the DD/taunt procs and our heals for them.. (hehe, healing
will be much better when I hit 30), warder is just plain awesome.


Let be known that warders are much harder to control then necro or
mage pets. So even with the control issue I don't wanna get rid of it.
Also their pathing REEKS!!
They get stuck at walls and corners worse then I ever saw any of my
mage pets do.
I think work on the warders isn't quite finished and VI needs to work
out the bugs on them.

Because I don't wanna get rid of warder in fights.. I may be facing a
"group  invite" issue at later levels.
What can I say... Beastlords and warders are just 2  parts of a
whole!! Hehe.. VI designed that way.
