Well, personally i can sometimes be a little irritated over the japanese 
part of my server.

Problems with japanese (or korean) so far:
Needed to do the Kromriff Military Leggings quest 2 times because some 
japanese people didnt understand the "doing quest now, leave broodmother 
nad the 2 named giants alone" shout.
KSed by a japanese guy after camping Gynok for 9 hours, because he sat 
at entrance to Befallen, ignored all my sayings that the area was camped 
and Gynok would spawn there, he ended up killing Gynok when he of course 
aggroed.

Both times they finally said they didnt understand english.


The funny part of it is that the same japanese players (wrote down the 
names) dont have any problems understanding english when you trade with 
them, or they need a favor or a port. I had conversations with 2 of the 
morons from giant fort before a port, and they didnt have any problems 
talking english then.

And after losing over 10 hours of work to people that can only talk 
english they it fit their purposes, and claim they cant when they do 
something that ruin quests or camps for other people i am actually 
getting a little tired of the japanese players.
And yes, i do know that most of them can talk english and are good 
players, it just bothers me that they use languages as an excuse for 
their behaviour.

Oh, and as a side note, when you enter the game, the english EULA come 
up. Is the EULA in japanese in japan, or how does it work? If not, how 
can you legally play the game if you dont understand the EULA?
