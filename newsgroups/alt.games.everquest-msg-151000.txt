Your point is lost on anyone with actual experience. Bards never replace 
Enchanters and vice-versa. They fill different roles. They overlap in 
some areas, but so do a lot of classes. I certainly wouldn't dump an 
Enchanter for a Bard; even when you're lucky enough to get a Bard that 
knows what they're doing, what they can sing at any given time is 
limited, as is their range.

Get what you need for your group.
