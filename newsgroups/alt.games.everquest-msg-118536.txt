My response wasn't in reference to FoH/AL or anyone specifically. It was
in rebuttle to the assumption that I, and everyone else who plays the EQ
endgame, is a pastyfaced spotty teenaged loser with no
job/life/prospects, financed by absent parents in his basement hovel,
and who's last contact with female genitalia was birth

So what if a couple of FoH's more vocal members happen to have
tourettes. If they were nuclear scientists if wouldn't make me one too,
just because I choose to put the time into playing EQ. 

BTW, most high end guilds have about 100 fully active members at most.
More than that becomes un-manageable. If everyone wanted to log on for
the first kill of a non keyed mob, once you get over 80 people at a
raid, numbers become detrimental. Telling guildie03 why he has to leave
but guildie07 can stay isn't something that I would want to get into...
