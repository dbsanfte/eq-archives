I am trying to make a macro that will let me stand, cast superior heal, and
then sit me back down again with book open.  I am near 35 so soon I will
just need to sit down without book.  Here's what I have tried so far to no
avail.

/sit off
/cast 7
/pause 40
/book 1

As it is casting superior healing I get the message that I cant use that
command while casting...

Frustrated

Thanks
