Perhaps you mean the Purified Crystal Dagger, which results from this 
quest:

http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1282

When done with a Crystalized Shadow Dagger from ToFS.  It isn't listed as 
a possible reward, despite me emailing Allakhazam a picture of it a few 
days ago. :)

Note, not to be confused with the Purified Dagger resulting from the 
Fading Shadow Dagger...

For the truly devoted:  Man, Valley Spiritling Stones are a pain in the 
butt to camp!  Darned TLC...
