38 Pally and 37 Cleric duo and we've been spending some time on the 2nd floor
of TOFS.  Last night  we finally got the Angry Librarian to spawn and got the
key to the third floor.  My main question is do you think the two of us will be
able to handle the third floor?  We didn't have too much trouble on the 2nd
floor even though it was tough to soothe mobs because they were always around
the corner of a bookshelf or something that made it difficult to cast on them
before they saw you.  Is it possible to single pull on the third floor?  From
looking at the map at EQatlas it looks like it should be easier to single pull
since the room isn't so wide open.  Any tips and or suggestions greatly
appreciated.  TIA.
