Yeah, _The Business_ was a bit weak (although worth reading if only for the 
"encoded message" part... :). _Inversions_ is actually part of the 
"Culture" series of SF novels, even if the Culture itself is never 
mentioned by name. It will become obvious if you find and read a few other 
of his novels. As for non-SF, try to find _The Bridge_, and avoid _Canal 
Dreams_ and _A Song of Stone_ until you are already a fan.
