Probably more like one in twenty, most people seem to prefer being
sheep.

Not true where I was reading.

A more accurate read on Paladins than my poor rants here would be
the activity on the PoN Class Balancing forum.  Or so it seems to
me anyway.

The EQ2 Beta has been announced, I see no reason for me to not
abandon EQ (original) entirely.  This makes it pretty pointless
for me to continue arguing about EQ (original).  It's just as
well.  EQ's a far different game in a number of ways from when
I started, and I'm not fond at all of some of those changes.

This seems like as good a time as any to move on...
