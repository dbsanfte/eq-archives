The design flaw in EQ is simple. Priests are more or less chain casting
healing spells from the time they login to the time they logoff, especially
in zones like KT+, MPG and RS zones. They hardly have time to cast any other
spell during the course of a battle in EQ. The funny part is that you could
probably remove every spell a 70 lvl cleric has in his spellbook and just
have the level 39 Complete Healing and nobody would even notice... ROFL ;)

In good RPG designs, the priests healing spells are basically only used
during the aftermath of a battle. In the battle itself, the priest is
casting a variety of defensive and offensive spells. When the battle is
over, he helps the group heal up so they can procede to the next battle /
adventure. This is much like how D&D has always worked, and it sure is alot
more fun for play that type of priest than how healers are forced to play
their roles at level 70 in EQ. The game dynamics in EQ changed so much after
level 40 that the tanks need a heal incoming nearly 100% of the time during
the course of 1 mob, so the priest needs to med during battle, causing your
priest to be just sitting and medding, casting CH when the tank needs it and
nothing more.

Everquest(tm) How many times does you want to cast Complete Healing today?
