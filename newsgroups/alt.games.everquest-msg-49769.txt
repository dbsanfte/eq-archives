I dont know anything about #1 but I can answer #2:
You can make money by doing many things. You can loot corpses and sell the
items they drop, you can become a blacksmith and make armor/weapons/etc or a
tailor or any of the other trade skills and make money from the things you
sell, you can take donations for casting spells on others, ... there are
many ways to make money in the game. Look around the web for strategy
guides, read through them and decide what you enjoy doing. If you like to
hack and slash then do that, if you enjoy fulfilling quests do that (there
are a lot of quest lists out there on the web), .. the game is what you make
of it.

There are a lot of quests in the game. They are initiated by various NPCs
around the world. I'd start with your guild. Hail all the NPCs there. If
they have any words in what they say surrounded by [ ] then ask them about
those words. i.e.
An NPC Says, "Hello there Kaelgrim. Will you help us [fight for truth]"
You Say, "I will help fight for truth"
and then the NPC will continue the story and may tell you to bring them
various items.  This is normally how quests originate. Just search around
and you will find them.

Have fun,
