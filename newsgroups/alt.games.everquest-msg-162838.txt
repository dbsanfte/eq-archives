Honestly speaking, I think it's an excellent idea - which is precisely why
it will never, ever happen. You see implementing that idea requires
creativity and initiative, also, it would actually benefit the player. We
can't have that, now can we?

For fun, I suppose you could /feedback it, sacrifice a few Firiona Vie
figurines to Lord Homacrothes, our pagan-goat-god, and let fate take its
course...
