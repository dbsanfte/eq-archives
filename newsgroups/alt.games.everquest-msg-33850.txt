Further, I noticed, when looking at these two bodies in NK, that my
animations were bugged, such that when I sat down, my perspective stayed the
same.  My Druid pet reported that, to her, I had not appeared to sit...
though my "sit" button did change to "stand" and I could not move (I was
sitting, just didn't look it).
    My druid pet was able to sit normally.
    Both bodies, and myself, were human and male.  My druid pet was
half-elven and female.
