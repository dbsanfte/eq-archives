Are all druids weird? Are all druids very picky about NOT sowing?

I just wonder.. I have followed the posts upwards, and it seems like some of
the druids that post here are "just a little" oversensitive when it comes to
this..

YES! i agree that a d00d coming up in mid fight with a "sow plz" is waaaay
of target..
YES! i agree that a d00d coming up with a "sow plz" and you have something
else to do, should take NO for an answer without being rude.

There is no reason for being rude if you ask a question and get no.. i
totally agree to that.

BUT! There is some limits in this.. it seems like some of the druids here
are type of "nah.. i wont give this d00d sow.. cos i dont feel like it right
now.. it is my RIGHT to not "feel" like giving a sow now.." Why?
If you are sitting on your arse waiting for a friend that is 3 zones away,
and a d00d comes up asking "sow plz".. WHY cant you just do it? Why say
"no", then get in to an argument with the d00d, then putting him on the
ignore list.. Seems to me that your complaints about "people cant even take
the time to write "please"" kind of response is waaay off, cos it certainly
takes a lot less time sowing the d00d and let him go off with it than doing
a lot more work arguing over it..

That is just MY thoughts.. but take a good look at some of the answers in
the different threads here.. and tell me from the bottom of your hearts that
"some" of the dr00ds here.. are just a "little-tiny-bit" off.. :)

Btw.. I can cast sow.. and i am not a druid or shaman.. who am i? (Must be
why i am not that much harassed about it as well..)
