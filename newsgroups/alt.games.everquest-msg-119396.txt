Create a LV1 alt, doesn't matter race & class, though one with sneak would
be nice (hide too if you can).

Go to a Luclin portal nearest you.

Port to Luclin.

Go to Shadow Haven, a zone next to Nexus (where you port into Luclin at).

Get a bind from the soulbinder right near the zone (I think he is to your
left, or North, when you port into it).

Return to Nexus and take the port to the Great Divide, a Velious zone.

Explore it just for some fun, & if you die, you're only LV1, and bound just
a zone away (2 actually, but just minutes).  Maybe come up with some nice
desktop wallpaper images.
