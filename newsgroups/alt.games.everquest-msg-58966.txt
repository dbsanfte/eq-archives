It's true, but on Test only.  Before you can be an MPC (monster player
character) you just have to create a real character (assuming you don't
already have one), log it on, then camp it.  After you do that then the tiny
"monster" button will work for you.

You can attack and you can move.  If you're a caster you can mem and cast
spells (though I've found that not ALL of them work).

You will be a random level 1-14 critter.  You don't get to pick.  If you die
or try to zone you'll drop back to the character screen and can hit the
Monster button again.

Yup, if you found it mildly interesting then it'll be fun for at least a few
times before you get bored with it.  I do it a few times every week or so,
whenever I'm bored or whenever I remember it's there. :)   No word at all
when it'll be live...they're working on issues with MPCs.
