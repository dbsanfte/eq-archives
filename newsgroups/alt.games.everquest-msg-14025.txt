Verant should have fixed the bug then not ban the people . Could care less
if one guild managed to get 4 uber items of mass destruction . It is far
more likely they would get cloth caps anyway . If its a farming sistuation
just announce the general lowering of the zone in 5 mins and keep it down
untill you get a chance to recode it .

It looks to me like conquest was probably exploiting a bug . Then verant
reacted as something other than a buisness which is their main fault . Its
not fair we are not winning is not really an ok attitude for a buisness .
Tactics is really a dirty word to verant and it wasnt always that way . They
just try and take the lazy way out .
