From the relatively little I have seen of the game and read
on this newsgroup it des appear though that a little planning
is required.  For instance I sometimes play for relative short
periods because that is all I can fit into my schedule so I 
need to able to solo to a relatively high level.  I hate 
running around after mobs, firing of a nice little Burst of 
Flame or similar to get their attention is much easier :-).
So I am thinking Druid or Shaman.  Of course I do`nt know
enough about the setup at higher levels to know which is best
when you get there.

At the moment I like my Wood Elf Druid because EverFrost is not 
by a long way my favorite place :-))
