I had the same problem and I tried all the stuff you did myself.

I loaded my default skin. I did the /dopropertinting on and zoned.

I then logged off, deleted the two target ring files, and repatched. 

When I got on again, I got my rings. I havent checked every character,
but I quit using the custom UI, and I use the default one.
