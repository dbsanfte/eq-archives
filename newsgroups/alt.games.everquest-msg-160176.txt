No, it fits the mould of the fantasy world....if you accept the concept of
cultural smithing at all then the half elf stance that is taken in EQ is
reasonable. THey have typically in fantasy games been portrayed as being
stuck on the periphery of society not accepted by one side or the
other...Tolkein was actually one of the moderates in this in some ways and
one of the extremists in others...because his half elves could be fully
accepted into either society but had to give up everything of the other
essentially. Some authors make the point in assorted pulp fiction to have
half elves called half-men by the elves. To have halfelves as being partly
in each society but not fully is a fairly standard societal view of the
race in games. Its not the only possiblity but it is common - and its
pretty much a bit of social commentary.

Halfelves retaining enough of the blood/build/characteristic of choice to
fit a wide variety cultural armours yet not being able to be taught to
make it is not unreasonable given the setup of EQ...irritating yes,
particularly to tradeskillers - but it is also game balanced by their
ability to wear a wide range of cultural armours.

If you are to attack the setup of halfelves in the cultural tradeskill
setup there are two lines I can see you take - first that although
reasonable in game terms and balanced its sufficiently annoying to many
that it might be worth considering a change to an alternate system (which
is different to saying its simply not fair) or you have to suggest the
entire cultural tradeskill system is unreasonable and should be changed -
an argument thats rather different but certainly has some legs...change
the cultural skills to being 'traditions' and allow one person to only
access one tradition per tradeskill is oe way of doing it...we already
have race specific and tradeskill specific trainers in the game adding a
faction limit of ally to this for training skill X should not be difficult
and this then allows you to get into whatever specialist tradeskill you
want with the right work (assuming faction is at all possible), then you
at least remove the fixed nature of race by race setups and give an
element of player choice in what they make without losing the balance of
one specialist area per tradeskill per person. Againhalfelves could either
get their own tradeskill at that point, or get access to the right
traditino at the ight faction or remain as the outcast unable to
make but able to use a variety of armours..possibly put a faction limit on
the armour so that they have to selet their 'ancestry' to dwarf, man, or
the flavour of elf in question - all those options at least requires the
half elf to try and make himself acceptable to a given culture to get the
armour in some way which fit the roleplaying mode (roleplaying and eq
hmmmmm.....have I sworn :)
