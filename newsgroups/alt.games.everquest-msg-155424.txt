This is not correct.

There are six Cabilis factions:
Legion of Cabilis (most guards and the warriors)
Crusaders of Greenmist (remaining guards and SKs)
Swift Tails (monks)
Cabilis Residents (merchants and bank)
Brood of Kotiz (necros)
Scaled Mystics (shamans, and at least one guard in FOB)

You do get a faction benefit, but the benefit is not enough with SOME
Cabilis factions to get above KOS.

You will be able to bank and shop, but stay away from the Shaman and SK
guilds.

The problem is that the one guard in FOB (Crusader Quarg) is on Shaman
faction, not SK faction, and he hangs around at the zone.  So if you pop up
the illusion and head on in, he'll attack you if he sees you.  So will the
Furscale twins in the building near the Shaman guild.

Just cast the illusion and invis, then make sure to put invis back on again
after banking and shopping, and you'll be fine.
