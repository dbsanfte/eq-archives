Cirocco is a lvl 35 druid and yes, she went against all good advice and 
enjoyed whacking critters with magic so much that she didn't melee as 
needed.  Now, she wants to remedy her mistakes with as little pain as 
possible (wouldn't we all?).

I know she should be going after light blues or lower dark blues, but just 
wondering which mobs in your experience do not deal out as much damage.  
Getting hit by a blue sarnak in the Overthere results in half of her 
hitpoints gone before she runs off and finishes them off with magic.  Is 
that the only way?  Again, she's just trying to work on this before it gets 
totally out of hand.

Thanks for any advice,


rbeez
