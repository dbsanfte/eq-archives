    This is exactly what you said to start all this:

"DL has a ZEM? I wonder what they thought it was about this exceedingly
easy zone that made them decide to give it a zem."

    You didn't talk about some generic experience modifier, you referenced
the ZEM. As the OP pointed out to you, duh, of COURSE it has a ZEM as EVERY
zone has a ZEM. You didn't know that because you didn't know what a ZEM
really was.

    Do I have to quote your own words back at you until it sinks in? You
didn't know what a ZEM was. You. Just. Did. Not. Know.

    A ZEM doesn't make mobs give more experience, it makes them give
experience period. A zero ZEM, as has already been pointed out to you, would
imply mobs gave no XP at all.

> At no time did I claim I knew the formula

    "I'm fully aware of what a ZEM means." ZEM is DEFINED BY THE FORMULA.

    You are such a fucking moron it defies logic. The formula defines what
ZEM means, so how the fuck could you know what it meant if you didn't either
know the formula or how it fit into the formula? And don't spin me the same
bullshit line about "I knew it was a modifier..." because as your DL comment
shows, you had no clue whatsoever.

"DL has a ZEM? I wonder what they thought it was about this exceedingly
easy zone that made them decide to give it a zem."

    Nothing there asking what a ZEM is, just a statement expressing surprise
that DL has one. Had you instead said, "Wait, ZEMs just enhance XP, don't
they? Why would an easy zone like DL have one?" we wouldn't be having this
thread. That would have expressed some question about what a ZEM is,
something your statement does not.

 "DL has a ZEM? I wonder what they thought it was about this exceedingly
easy zone that made them decide to give it a zem."

    Where's the question about the formula?

    Nope, I'm just trying to do the impossible: get you to say "I was wrong,
I didn't know what a ZEM was, I should not have claimed to know even after
my error was pointed out." I doubt it'll work, but you never know!
