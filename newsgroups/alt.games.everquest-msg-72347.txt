They play it like working in a factory, get the job done ASAP. It
really doesn't take that long with the right tools such as a chanter
and or cleric and what not to do the atone type stuff. None of them
got to 60 on a vah shir yet just "playing" it from 1 - 60. There has
not been enough time. There is probably less played time on their 60
vah shir than on a level 25 character of yours.
