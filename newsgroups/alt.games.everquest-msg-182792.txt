I want to enjoy playing EQ.  I really do.  The problem is that there
are a few things about the game that just ruin it for me.  My sole
character is a level 16 warrior.  

Succumbing to death doesn't really mean that much.  You get killed and
get to immediately come back to life sans some experience points and
your stuff.  You then go hunt down your own corpse and retrieve your
stuff.  The whole process seems silly at best.  At least back in the
day playing Dungeons and Dragons death meant death.  You got killed
and you had to go sit on the sofa and watch TV while everyone else
still got to play.  In EQ you just go loot your own corpse and go on
like nothing happened.  Doesn't this process bother anyone?

Also, much of the game is simply running around right mouse clicking
creatures and if they "con" Blue or White, you attack them.  Heal and
repeat.  Heal and repeat.  It doesn't matter what level you are, the
process is the same.

What am I missing?
