OK, so I've often said I don't care much about the 10pp 5 gp it
costs to cast Aego (or marzin or naltron for that matter)

And I really don't care much, just operating expenses.

But I'm often approached by people asking me to Aego them...
"I'll give you a peridot" or "here's 10pp"

That 20% of my mana bar.  Or for the lowbies, thats about 50% of
my mana bar plus two peridot.

If they offered the peridot plus 100pp, I still wouldn't be
interested particularly, but at least it would show some respect
for what they are asking.  At "a peridot" or "10 pp" (seriously
the only offers I ever get) they are saying my mana, my time, is
worth nothing at all, or less.

For the record, no, I won't aego you if you give me a peridot.
Maybe for a smile, but not for a peridot.
