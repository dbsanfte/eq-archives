Humm I wonder where you were then.
Where did you go from the entrance ?

At 7th I would just hunt round the entrance area.
There should not be too many Legos there, baring trains.

I *think* a full group of 7th coul take trainer hill.
If it wasn't camped.
If you could break the spawn a bit.
and if you were a little lucky.
Of course it has been a long time since I was there.

One thing to remember in lots of zones.
You see a train, you run.

HTH,

Jim
