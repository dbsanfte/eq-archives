What, did you expect to learn anything about the different classes or have
any kind of different feel to the classes after playing to (Oh my god ur
uber!) !!12th!! level??

Yup, lag can suck.  That's why you don't play the game with a 486 using the
motherboard graphics :)

And your point is?  In case you hadn't noticed this is an everquest
newsgroup, which might imply that we're all still playing the game, and that
in turn ought to clue you in to the fact that nobody here is likely to say,
"Uh-huh, guys, he's right you know, I hadn't looked at it that way, but now
that he mentions it, if he wasn't having enough fun by the time he'd gotten
his char all the way to lvl 12 this game must suck ass!"
