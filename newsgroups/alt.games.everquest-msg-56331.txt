The best one is the one you'll enjoy playing the most.  Gnomes start with
either the worst or the 2nd worst stats but it's the only pure caster I'd
ever consider playing.  Why?  Doesn't matter, it's not like I'm going to try
to talk you into it. :)

INT and CHA are both important but both are fairly easily raised by buffs &
items.

Don't be a powergamer...don't be a stat hound...pick the race you'd most
prefer to play.  BTW, I don't believe there's any connection between
tinkering & jewelcraft, though it'd be cool if there was. :)
