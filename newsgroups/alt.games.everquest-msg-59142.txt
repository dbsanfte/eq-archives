Ummm, maybe you need a better guild.  I log on, run from Kael (bards
travel fast), zone into ToV, and then immediately kill non-stop for 4
hours.  I guess if I were to log on 2 hours earlier I could wait
around, but that's why we post start times.  If I were to log on 2
hours early, it certainly wouldn't be a hassle, just go to Velks Lab,
get some mindless exp hanging out with friends, then run to the GD
circle for the port.  Wah, I had to run for 2 minutes.

Huh?  Granted a TPW can take a bit of time, but I've yet to see an
hour CR in ToV, but maybe you mean NToV, haven't done a lot there yet.
Enough to know that a camp-out cleric will turn an hour CR into a 10
minute CR, just enough time to nuke some snacks and hit the john.  Our
60 clerics have had to start timing Aego.

Explain where you do this.  I know that this is how you do boss mobs,
if they happen to be in a zone with no other mobs around.  I guess Sev
counts, BFD, 1 outdoor dragon.  Hunting dragons in WW should be almost
constant pulls, at least a dozen an hour.  Haven't done VP or ST yet,
but from what I can see of VP (wil have 24 with keys this week) you
have to be able to move fast and rebuff on the fly.
One of the best raids I've ever done was a Trak raid that took 3
tries.  Last try with 18 people from zone-in to dead Trak in 45
minutes, including fighting our way through every possible mob on the
way.

Have you found in every level appropriate zone?  When's the last time
you and a partner took out Estrella just to say you could?  Or you
solod an entire camp of stuff that used to eat you for lunch just
because they still give exp?

Well, if I had a 55 enchanter, and I was tired of clicking my snake, I
would probably go to Seb and drag a group to Juggs, or at least to
King.  Or maybe I'd go to SS/Kael/Icewell and form a group.  Or maybe
go to SG or DN and get those nifty chanter drops there.  Hell, maybe
go to CoM and solo the goos just because I can.  Or maybe stop whining
and go on raids where enchanters charming mobs is part of the
strategy.

How many days /played do you have on your EQ account?  How many days
/played do you have on your DAoC account?  When they're equal see how
you feel about them.
