The bard in our group needs armor upgrades.  He's level 43, as of last 
night.  It's safe to say he pretty much has worse than Lambent in every 
slot.  He has banded arms and boots, so when I am in Sol A. this weekend, I 
am going to try to grab the items for those lambent quests.

Our group won't be grouping FRI-SUN, so he is going to use that time to 
work on his lambent quests.

If you know of any items that are easier / cheaper / better to get than 
lambent for him, please let me know what they are and I will pass it along.

I told him about the Dusty Breastplate that drops from Dustback in FM.  If 
you know anything about the spawn ( time, PHs, etc ), I'd love to hear it.
