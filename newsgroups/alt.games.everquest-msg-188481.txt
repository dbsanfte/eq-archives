I can only compare these two.  My information on AC2 is now over a month 
out of date; some things will likely have improved.

AC2 has a branching skill system, reminiscent of Diablo 2, whereas EQ 
has a linear skill system.  Despite the better presentation of AC2's 
system, I didn't really find it to be superior, but my understanding is 
that it gets more interesting at levels higher than I stuck around for.

AC2's crafting system is much more accessible at low levels than EQ's 
crafting system.  However, AC2's crafted items were (at the time I 
played) generally inferior to dropped items once cost was factored in, 
so there was little reason to craft past the lowest levels.  

AC2's interface is more arcadey, with a default behind-the-character 
view and a radar that potentially shows you everything around you, 
whether or not it's in line of site or not.  EQ looks more like a 
traditional RPG, and the only real handholding part of the interface now 
are the maps (which I was using offline anyways, so don't mind).

EQ runs immeasurably better on my machine than AC2.  Even when I got AC2 
to a smooth framerate, it would hiccup due to its no-zone way of 
handling the world.  Basically, it was constantly loading in 
information, so would sometimes have to pause until everything came over 
the wire.  This is on an Athlon 2100+ with a Geforce4 Ti4600, 1G of RAM 
and a good broadband connection.  EQ's zones are less immersive, I 
suppose, but framerate's generally even (and usually smooth, aside from 
in a few select areas on Luclin).

AC2's chat capabilities were more or less nonexistent (earshot only, a 
la "say" in EQ), but they were working on global channels.  Because of 
the lack of chat, you couldn't find groups, unless you were lucky enough 
to bump into a group of people hanging out in front of some dungeon 
somewhere.  I also had zero sense of player community for the same 
reason.

AC2 has a much better handle on its backstory than EQ.  The backstory 
actually seems to play some part in the main game.  EQ is more a series 
of curiosities, where a backstory occasionally rears its head if someone 
needs some NPC text.  Note that EQ's gotten better since the tabletop 
RPG (and atlas) came out in that regard, but it still doesn't really 
play much part in the game.

EQ has a lot more people playing.  AC2 felt barren.

AC2 had better music.

That's about it.  I guess the clincher is that I'm paying for EQ again, 
and AC2 got booted off my box within two months.
