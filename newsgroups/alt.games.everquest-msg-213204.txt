Someone said the problem cleared up for them when they enabled WinXP's
native firewalling. It's been suggested to grab Zone Alarm or some
other such firewall software and also run a full virus scan. The
person who suggested it to the one having the problem didn't get a
chance to find out if it was effective or not, though.

Seems puzzling to me, though, that a virus, worm, or some such would
prevent you from logging into certain EQ characters, but I guess it's
worth a shot.

I do not think witchcraft is a religion, and I do not think it is in any 
way appropriate for the U.S. military to promote it.
-- George W. Bush, October 15, 2000 
(Notice how Bush does away with the Wiccan's right to religious liberty
by redefining Wicca as not a religion and further denigrating it with 
the term witchcraft.)
