I have to agree with you on one point. I don't understand why people get 
so worked up about the occasional new rpg spam. Heck, I typically go 
check 'em out myself. I'm always on the lookout for another good one.

Many of us could certainly use a reminder to keep things in perspective. 
Thanks for that.

As far as the CoH posts go, however, I find them to be quite interesting. 
Though I wasn't much interested in the game at first, the more I read 
about it, the more the idea of a super hero mmorpg is growing on me.

Richard posted his first installment merely to share a taste of the game 
- a personal and credible review, if you will - here with friends and 
with the promise that he wouldn't make a habit of it. He has since been 
asked to give us more and has done so. I personally appreciate his taking 
the time, though I can see where some might find it not only OT, but also 
uninteresting.

I'm sure that if/when an alt.games.coh ever does materialize, it will all 
be directed there. Until then, we always have the option of not reading 
it.

Btw, if all CoH discussion does move elsewhere, I would appreciate 
notification of its new home posted in this group. :)
