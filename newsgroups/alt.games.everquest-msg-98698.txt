Geez, that made me laugh.
It reminded me of a BIG mistake i made of snaring someone elses pull, an
innocent mistake, and having some towering barbarian running up to me (a
shorty halfling) and screaming WHAT ARE YOU A NOOB?? And after reading that,
the comparison is obvious.
The weirder thing about that particular situation was he felt it more
important to remind me of my n00b status than the fact of that goblin
getting free hits at his back.
Sure enough..2 min later
