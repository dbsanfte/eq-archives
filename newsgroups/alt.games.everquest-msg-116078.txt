I've heard many stories of LV1 players running from Qeynos to Freeport or
reverse.  Never actually tried it at that LV, but have at LV8 or so
(actually from Halas to Freeport).  Though I think the biggest challenge
would be the same run, but through South Karana and Rathe Mountains, though
Ogre and Troll lands, then through the desert, for a good race at LV1.  Has
anyone done this?  If so, have many done it?
