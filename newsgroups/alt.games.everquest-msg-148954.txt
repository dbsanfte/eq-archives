Killing guards is an entertaining pastime.  It is also lucrative both
monetarily, and xp-wise, depending on which guards, and what level you are.
It also raises factions that you may be interested in, while lowering ones
you don't care about.  I am not talking about newbie guards there to protect
the newbies, I am talking about guards inside the cities.  Freeport was fun,
I got myself to ally with the paladins in NFP by killing the evil, corrupt
Freeport Militia within the city, and turning in their helmets.  I also made
a nice chunk of change, and xp.  In Neriak, I had a great time, made great
xp at levels 52, 53, and 54, and made a very nice chunk of change, killing
guards that already hated me.  BTW, I did not start on the Freeport Militia
until they already hated me as well.  If an NPC feels the need to attack me
on sight, I have no compunction whatsoever about going in, and exterminating
them.
