I suspect any class would have a difficult time taking aggro away from
a wizard equipped with the Staff of Temperate Flux.  Even when the
wizard is oom.  The exception would be the mobs that base aggro on
proximity - we all know tissue paper doesn't make good tank armor. 
Oh, another exception would be a similarly-equipped wiz.
