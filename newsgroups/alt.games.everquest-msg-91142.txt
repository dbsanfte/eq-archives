Had bad lag last night and alot of spikes..now this is not uncommon after a
patch .  But, what if the powers that be at Verant decided that they didnt
want to put the resources into their regular customers paying 10 bucks a
month while they really pushed the 40 dollars a month EQ.  So basically
we...being the 10 dollar a month crowd are now second class citizens and get
scraps...this game has been out a while so theyve made their money on
it...and maybe we are going the way of Diable and Ultima Online..with lag
and weird bugs galore...
     They do have a few games working in the background with Star Wars
etc... so maybe they figured concentrate on the smaller number at 40 dollars
a month..you have a base that has 1/4 of the people paying so you have that
less hassle of handling that many on your servers.  Maybe they are thinning
the herd...now this is wild speculation but what if they figure that with
the popularity at the original release they can take care of less people
with more money while their initial release of new games will bring in a new
glut of the old customers...but hey theyve had a good run with a very good
customer base for 2 years plus...now we can get used to getting second class
service  like Diablo and Ultima Online...
