I'm a recent convert to its utility. Boat death with one chr; was
transported to the top of the mast when zoning into OOT and then slammed to
the deck. /consent to my bard with DMF and locating lyric running. When the
boat left the zone, my corpse was shoved all the way to the northern part of
the zone vs being dropped on the boat route.

Ran around the zone over the water until the corpse was located, then drug
it to an isle.
