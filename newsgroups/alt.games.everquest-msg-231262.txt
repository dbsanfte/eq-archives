Just goes to show how pissy RZ and Co. really are..

Tunare has been putting up with intruders in PoG for ages now...
Does she bitch and moan? Nope, she usually just smacks us around a

And Inny in PoH? Well, he hates everyone already, but still...

Sheesh...you'd think the God of War would be a little more
