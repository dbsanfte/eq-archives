Except that the left has a stronger hold over the mass media, while the
right has talk radio, FNC, and the editorial pages of the Wall Street
Journal.  Granted, that just means they've got a stronger army in the
mud-slinging battle... doesn't really bother me, except when they sit there
with their smug looks, claiming to be above it all.

True, but they would be eaten alive.  We saw how Ashcroft fared when he
refused to sling mud at Jean Carnahan (SP?).  Not engaging in politics when
you're a politician is somewhat akin to the French in WWII.

Partisanship is not neccessarily bad, unless you let it move you from your
true stance on the issue.  Take the issue of the war with Iraq.  Regardless
of what you think about it's merits, it should at least strike you as a
little odd that the same people who were all for it when Clinton was trying
to dodge some issue or another are also the ones who are screaming the
loudest about Bush and corruption now.  Bombing Iraq isn't the issue, _Bush_
bombing Iraq is (for the record, when Clinton did so, my response was "Right
answer, wrong reason.")

Congressman from OK fourth district.  Very principled man who's gone against
the republican majority when he feels it proper.  I may not always agree
with him, but I do hold him in the highest regard.

Yet we, as voters, tolerate said brawl.

It's very much the "you have the right to free speech, if you can find an
audiance" thing.  They can push as much as any other party, within the
boundaries of the first ammendment.

I don't think it will really go that far.  I'd just like to have the same
rights as everyone else.

Who really goes beyond criticism?  Granted, I've heard alot of disparaging
remarks, but no real condemnation.

We're two people (three, since Kaev is usually well reasoned) discussing
ideas.  We pick at those we disagree with, and praise those we do.  That's
not thought police.  None of us have tried to get someone banned (as if it
was possible on an unmoderated group) or tried to fillibuster or anything
else.  The worst it's gotten is that I'm completely ignoring Taras in this
thread because he can't engage in a civil debate.  Granted, it may be a bit
overboard, but I'm not required to put up with his scheist, so I won't.

Well, capitalism checked by the government keeps three interests in play.
Tends to keep the sheet nice and stretched out.  Take away the interest of
the companies (and therefore capitalism), and you get a two-way tug of war
between the gvt and the people.  It's only a matter of time before the gvt
hogs the blanket.  In essence, the gvt absorbs the interest and the power of
the companies.  That's like letting an IRS agent conduct his own audit.

I'll grant you that some liberals believe it, but I've got to object to
left-wingers.  Fair 'nuff?

There's a balance to be met.  A company can't make something to the point
where there is no margin for profit, nor can they completely rip off their
customers.  That's the reason why Toyota is the nation's biggest automotive
manufacturer.  Sure, there are companies, like GPX that make crap-ola, but
they're also priced appropriately.  If you want a radio _now_, you can
always go get a GPX brand and understand it'll be dead in a month.  Or, you
can save up, and get an Onkiyo... your choice.

> Then there's the tobacco companies...

They make a product that the people want.  Now, if you want to get into the
fact that they lied about their product, then that's an issue of fraud,
which is something completely removed from the question of capitalism.
Hammering people who commit fraud is something I would be perfectly willing
to consider a proper function of government.
