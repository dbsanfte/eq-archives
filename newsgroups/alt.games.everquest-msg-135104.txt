    Affliction is back to the way it was post-patch. That is to say, an
Extended Affliction item also works on roots, slows, mezzes, etc. When I
rooted some annoying mob and my Bone-Clasped Girdle shimmered I was VERY
happy. Paralyzing Earth lasts forever now. =)

    *cough* *sputter* Um, Bone-Clasped Girdle sucks? 75 HP/MANA? It's not a
Velious king-level belt, but it's VERY nice. And since it drops from PoF
demis it's relatively easy to get compared with the other items you listed.

    CH is specifically excluded from a lot of foci, even if it doesn't
really make sense, because they never want to make CH better than it is.
Ever.

    It looks lame, but sad as it is it's one of the better cleric bracers in
the game until Skyshrine/Kael/the new smithed stuff. Bracers are a real weak
spot for clerics.

    It has Sv. F, no Sv. M, the same WIS as your cleric gold bracer. ;-)

    You get the message when you're in the range where you couldn't hit the
target without the bracer. It's great for Remedy, not so noticeable for
other heals. Classes that kite love this spell, and classes with bolts can
do some absolutely broken things with it (like nuke from outside pursuit
range on Kunark mobs, killing them without them even attempting to come
after you).

    The Obulus Death Shroud isn't so bad a shoulder item, and unless all you
cast is CH the mana savings from MP III > mana gained from FT 2 on the
eighth prayer shawl. (They're equal if you're using 20 mana per tick, and
considering your base sitting med rate is higher than that I would ASSUME
you're using more mana per tick.)

    Swap it in, cast buff_with_reagent, swap it out.

    I have spell haste II on my Necklace of Superiority. Faster DA/DB, and
faster Gate. Yummy!
