Nay, I'm willing to bet the farm that they can't be druids.  Looking at
another post, it was mentioned that Vermiculated is not VAH capable, while
ES is.  So I took a look at my Umbral BP and see the listed races as TRL OGR
DEF HUM ERU.  Then I look at my Bloodember BP and it includes the previous
mentioned races, as well as GNO, HLF, HEF, HIE, DWF, ELF.  Judging by these
2 comparisons, it would seem that Kunark armor, ie Elder Spiritualist, uses
the rae list from the armor set it's derived from, IE Blood Ember lists all
plate races and ES lists all leather races (ES uses leather coding despite
looking like chain, likewise Myro uses chain coding despite being plate)
Meanwhile the Planar armor sets, Umbral and Vermiculated use specific coding
so that only races which can be the class, can wear it.  This explains why
ES lists VAH under race and Verm doesn't.
