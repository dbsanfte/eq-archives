I'm regularly told I tank better than pickup group paladins or shadowknights
and I've even been in groups with 65 warriors where I have been the
preferred tank.

I have all tanking and DPS AA now (including, amazingly, double
riposte) and 7800hp full buffed though, so I guess I'm not typical.

Point being, a ranger will never tank as well as a 'tank' at the same
stage of the game, but can, at *all* stages of the game, bar high end
raiding, become a 'good enough' tank. I've tanked NToV with a single
group 'raid', for example. For fun, of course ;) The drops were twink
fodder by that stage.
