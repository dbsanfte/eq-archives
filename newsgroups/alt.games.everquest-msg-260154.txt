That's as may be, but you still didn't snip the part of the post you 
weren't responding to, ie, everything -below- your one-line comment.  

And we didn't flame the first poster who top posted and didn't snip, 
because you aggroed him first.  Grats!  

Your skill at flaming topposters has increased! (1).
