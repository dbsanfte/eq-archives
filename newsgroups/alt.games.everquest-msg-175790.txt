I'm not a prophet in the classic biblical sense in that a lot of things I
have written are pretty loony, inaccurate, affected by Satanic influence,
etc.

There is only one main concept that I would say was spiritually divined and
that was the fact that the last 7 years has begun, my eyes opened the night
of the 31st as though I was being called into action like someone who had
been asleep and was just awakened.

Soon after that I learned that Ribera died and read the article and it
seemed to make decent sense that he was probably the antichrist since he had
the headwound and he changed his name which I would have to assume must fit
some numeralogical formula for 666 which I don't know about or care to know
about.

Maybe Sidney Omarr is the False Prophet? it said in the article that he had
changed his name too.

Everything else I have said much of which was written while in a manic
psychotic state is mostly speculation and much of it seriously tampered by
Satan who has been constantly attacking me since I began doing this. I did
actually have a brief vision of seeing the cloud cover but I doubt it would
appear in one year, probably not until the 7 years is over. I have also had
a brief vision of a jeep with a white cross on the back driving towards
Washington State which I had about 7 years ago.

I don't have any direct power to control the weather, I do believe that God
has power over the weather and uses it as a kind of feedback to show us if
he is angry or not, and probably will use it to avenge me if I am harmed in
some way during this period and not allowed to complete my 3.5 years of
prophetic revelation and constant annoying written behavior (breathing fire
out of my mouth to burn my enemies) as it says in Revelations Chap. 11. So
based on that, I would have to assume that I will not be in prison assuming
I don't do anything really stupid as I would not be able to complete my
testimony to the world as I am supposed to

I think it says in Acts or something that no one in the modern age Christian
church would ever be given the full gift of prophecy as it wasn't needed
anymore. I do believe that I have some minor prophetic abilities though and
I would say that many of my speculations will happen especially the ones
based on fairly conservative and agreed upon prophetic concepts like the
mid-trib rapture

The two prophets could actually be representative of two independent cells
as there is someone out there who I don't know making sure that what I write
ends up on Usenet.
