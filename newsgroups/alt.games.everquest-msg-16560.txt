Why are you trying to get bound in FV?  Here are the places you can be
bound in Kunark:

1. FV.  This is the outpost for *good* races.  With a lot of faction
work, you can get them to like you (I know a Dark Elf Cleric who used to
hang out there a lot), but it is a lot of work.

2. OT.  This is the outpost for *evil* races.  Ogres are evil.  Until
you start doing certain Kunark dungeons which screw your OT faction,
this is your safe spot in Kunark for banking and stuff.

3. Cabilis.  Iksar won't like you, but with a lot of faction work, you
can get in.

4. There's a place in Frontier Mountains you can bind.

5. In the runins in Field of Bone around the Keasora entrance you can be
bound.
