The one I read mentioned the Erudites had a civil wars of sorts between the
good guys and the new-as-then necromancer types. The battles were mostly
magic based - and during one confrontation an apocolyptic mistake/accident
caused the formation of the hole and ceased the overt conflict. After that -
fear of mutually assured destruction kept the relative peace (cold war type
of peace) between the two factions. The necromancers then used the hole to
build their city off.

Of course - if there was a city of Kerrans stuck in no mans land between the
two armed camps they would not have fared to well ~ especially if each camp
feared the Kerrans would side with the other camp... Or maybe both armed
camps decided it was impossible to conduct a proper war with Kobolds chasing
Kerrans all over the island.....=P

Either way - genocide is not something that you boast about to your
grandkids, plus Erudites are not renown for their humble frankness...
