Thinking of taking our regular small gathering to CoM for a change of
pace and some faster xp than we've been getting regularly. (Two players
in hell, me about to go back into next hell.)  I've tried researching it
all I can, but there isn't a ton of strategy advice online for it that
I've found.
  Group of myself (44, nearly 45 warrior) 40 cleric, 40 rogue, with the
occasional possible addition of a 40 shaman from time to time, but
usually the three of us.  Thinking of just trying to stick a toe in near
the zone line and pull from the yard, not going deep in.
  Biting off more than I can chew?  Or a potentially good spot? Also, I
hear getting across EJ can be a bit of a bitch. Thoughts?
