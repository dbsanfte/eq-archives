 Three-Four months? Possibly longer or forever. Visit monkly-business
and look around, there are a few threads in there. Basically if you are
soloing and need to feign, it will work. The 'bug' comes into play when
you're grouped and there are multiple players on the mobs hate list. It
will ignore a successful feign and continue beating on you even while
you con indifferent.

 The mend bug has also been there 3-4 months. I just wait at least
thirty seconds before using it once it becomes active.
