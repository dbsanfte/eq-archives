...as well as maintain aggro

Comparably equiped, of course.  But then you keep forgetting that
taking damage is only half the job of a tank.

Groups of level ~57 will not fight level 66 mobs for experience.  If
they want to, and want to have a chance, they will get a warrior to
tank.  That is beside the point.  Meanwhile most experience groups
don't fight mobs almost ten levels higher.  Idealy, they fight mobs at
or just above their level.

You keep laughing at people and using an all-knowing tone on this
matter so I no longer will feel bad for telling you like it is.

You are clueless.

You won't be tanking anything near level 66 in PoP zones at 60.
