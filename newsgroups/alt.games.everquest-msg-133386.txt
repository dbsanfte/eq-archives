Ok...I think I see what the problem was.

Yes, I already had both the ore (from farming salts) and
the gem (from AAxping drolvargs), so I dropped 500 pp on
my CR mule in the Hole and then did the turn in...

Since this was done recently, I figured that's what you were
asking...but I've had the components on myself for a long
while so I had no idea about the durn things not dropping.

'Luck to you!
