Does anyone know of a good resource, particularly a sort of cheet
sheet for what stacks with what? I'm getting a depressing amount of
"Your spell would not have taken hold..." messages lately...
Particularly with people who have high level buffs from PoK on them.
As a Shammy I feel kinda useless when I can't buff people. :)
