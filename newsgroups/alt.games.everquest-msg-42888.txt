Any spell becomes a lot less useful when it wears out. What is your point?

I've been to the WC portal many times. I have yet to be attacked by any
dark elves. And yes, my character is KOS to them.

There are 3 classes who can cast SoW, one that has a group-only version
that is faster than SoW, 4 clickable items that raise running speed, and
buyable SoW potions.

Only wizards can port to the planes.

I'd have to label you as an idiot who doesn't know that you can't SoW jack
shit indoors.

Outside of velious, I'd say something like 80%. Maybe higher.

Your arguements would be more persuasive if they actually made any kind of
sense.

Thus the labeling of the category "When-the-shit-hits-the-fan". Are you not
a native english speaker?

Common items perhaps...only one I can think of at the moment is paladins
and the deepwater helm, and I only do that because pretty much every
paladin I've seen above level 40 wears one. Other ratings based on items
(such as epic weapons) are specified in a second rating that this applies
to when the class posses a given item. Velious PoG/Quest robes are not one
of them.

How the fuck would I know? Why don't you go ask some warriors, instead of
expecting me to be inside the head of 20,000+ people?

When you get above level 35, come back and apologize for your rank
stupidity.

For clarification (again), since you apparently lack sufficient brain
matter to read plainly constructed english sentences: THESE RATINGS ARE
BASED ON LEVEL 60 CHARACTERS. If you want to construct a rating system for
all classes every 4-5 levels or so, be my guest. If you aren't willing or
able to do that, kindly shut the fuck up.
