Buy +5int rings.
Buy 2 gold jade bracelets, 15mana/hp each and 2 ac each.  change them out
later with polished bone bracelets with 2ac 3int on them from evil eyes when
the mana from 3 int is more than the mana from the jade.  Also get some
10mana earrings while you're there in Xorbb (polished bone hoop).
Buy a velium Sapphire necklace, 8 str/int (useful also for the str)
If you don't want to dump money on him, 2 +2int rings, and the gold jade
bracelets are cheap.

Get a level 19-20 alt over to the warrens to farm Prince Bragnar for a cloak
of the forlorn with 3int on it
Get your group together and take out the snake titan in SB for a Mantle of
the Elder Serpent (4int)
Farm the kobold camps in SB with a  20-22 alt for a Forlord totem for 2 int
in either hand. (or just vendor check)

There's also the Skull of Jhen'tra from the gnolls in Lake Rathe, 20mana 3sv
magic.

Hell, even just do the SolRo shadowbound armor quests, get a Robe of
enshroudment, ShadowBound gloves and boots, 4int on robe, 3 on gloves,
15hp/mana on boots.  Plus semi-high int caster AC and some other nice stats.
Also, the Harvester quest in SolRo, great stuff for a human/erudite necro to
get rid of that damn
night-blindness and 5int in offhand

Weapon wise, if you cant find an Int staff, if he's erudite, go get the
Noclin's Femur from Paineel easy (on the necro, everything of the quest is
easy and no drop)  otherwise just go get a Crystal Grinder, for the AC
primarily, if you cant kill the guy in CC, just wait, one will rot =P (and
grab him a 25% WR herbalist pack while your at it, int casters have
notoriously bad STR)

Hope this helps!
