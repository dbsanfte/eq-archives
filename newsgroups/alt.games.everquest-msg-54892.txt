 I also came across the blood reaver....my lvl 24 shaman was heading to
sk..unknowly that the rathe mts..was now the nightfall haunting. I kind of knew
there was problems since the huge amount of corpses. I said to myself what the
hell...sure i cant even touch any of these...but if i can make it thorugh the
zone it would be a feat in itself.  After rounding the  corner by the gypies
and walking on eggshells the whole time....BOOM 500 damage....LOADING......hmm
welcome to lvl 23. I figure musta been a fluke..ill try again. during this time
there were numerous /ooc's shouts ect BR to LR zone..hmm BR whats that? I round
the coner again i make it past the gypies...and i begin to scale the wall i see
the zone!!!! Full of bodies and a few players getting beaten on...hmm...nows my
chance...run for the zone you stoopid troll!!!...BOOOOM....LOADING... hmm ok
its AOE im not going to get past him. I sneak up and watch from a distance as
this horiffic vile beast kills  each and every challenger...after watching for
some 30mins in pure terror...a group of finely tunned killers march into the 
zone line and begin the onslought....WOW they going to kill him OMG thier going
to do it!!!. he had about 1/3 health left...when he gains a full recharge of
health...WHOA!!! instantly i hear BR TO ZONE. Hmm not good..not only is this
beast almost un beatable....but he's using my corpse along with the 30+ others
as a foot rest on the zone line...After about 11/2 hours of watching this i did
end up getting my body after some careful swift movements...and actully
redinged to 34 wooohoo....it may not had been a kill fest for me..but i did
enjoy the being tactful and cautious in a area which i normally wouldnt have
any problems running through. Great Job Verant!!
