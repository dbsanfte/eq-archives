So Yaulp V has a 25% haste on it.  Chanter and shammy haste
spells, and bard songs, all stack with it, at least insofar as I
get both icons.

I also get the stat boosts from both YV and the various other
haste buffs that have side effects... but I'm familiar with non
stacking haste from bard songs which still lay on icon and lay on
side effects.

So what I'm wondering is, has anyone checked to see if YV haste
stacks with shaman/chanter (and normal bard song) haste, and if
if does, does it also stack with the special boosting bard song
haste?

One thought I have is that it could be using that high level bard
song slot, which would let it stack with most hastes and be
better effect than the bard song hastes.
