> >     <ticks "strongly dissagree">

    Just an aside note I'll run some tests with my pally friend when we get
a chance and see what we come up with... I'm intrigued now, because when I
first powerlevelled somebody I *had* assumed it went on damage, but based on
what I saw and posts others have made on the subject (almost ironic that PL
posts I was accused of not having read made me think this) that the game
doesn't have a clue who did what damage and stored but one thing with mobs -
the hate list. Just what I thought. If I'm wrong ill be happier, when I
first 'realised' that was the case I was rather discusted at the laziness of
it all.

    Agro could work in the same example. You remove the pet [removing any
record of the pet's agro], mob agros you, but the cleric nukes the mob
down - the [fatal] damage he does out-agros the fact that you happened to be
near enough for the mob to attack you.

    Once again [annoyingly] agro could work in this example. Your pet might
be holding agro but the mob will beat on the nearest player regardless.

    I appreciate the link and the quote both however I took it with a grain
of salt being that if Sony had done the whole thing based on the hate list
they probably wouldn't say "group with the highest aggregate hate gets the
kill" for a number of reasons, and would be happy to substitute "damage" for
"hate"

    I'm not suggesting that anyone do that, and I really would have to be
insane to expect people to :)
