Thanks everyone for the help on this one, I had always wondered about
this and it should make travel easier, though part of me is still
looking forward to doing the traditional run from Qeynos to Freeport
on foot :-)

However Qeynos and Qeynos Hills is my favorite newbie hunting grounds,
and I'd like my Froglok (if there's a PoK entrance near Gukta) and a
few of my lesser newbie characters (the ones I don't play much, just
experimenting with) to be able to train up there in familiar territory
:-)
