Hi There

Basically Lords of Everquest is a gather resources, build towns then 
build an army finally go and beat up an opponents army. Then in the 
jargon. Wash, rinse, repeat until someone wins the entire world.

Think Bush and you wont go to far wrong.

Either play online or (Single player computer generated opponent not 
sure on this part)

So you get to be a lord/king/commander of a country/state/city

It's only connection with EQ is the World it's set in.

There was a rumour that you could use the same names for your 
King/Commander/General as the one you have in EQ but as the characters 
are totally different and not interchangeable.

I think from memory its also set in a different time period to EQ but 
not sure on that either.

Anyway any interest I might have had in LoE has been totally lost thanks 
to that irritating Advert  (I live in the UK) So that when it does hit 
our shores I for one will be not buying it.

Yours
