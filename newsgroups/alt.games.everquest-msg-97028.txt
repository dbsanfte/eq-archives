What ever refresh rate your desktop is at, under settings display, for
a particular resolution is what refresh a direct x game will be at.

So if when you change the res to 1024 x 768 you are at 100 hz and it
works fine, the game will be at 100 hz.

That is assuming you don't have some outside problem that the
utilities the other people are talking about fix.
