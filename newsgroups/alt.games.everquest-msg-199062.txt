My problem with that is that I switch hotkey banks all the time... so in
order for this to work, Sense Heading has to be in the same hotkey in all my
banks.  And that's a waste.

It's not as bad as you might think... whenever I level up, I just pound the
Sense Heading hotkey as I'm walking.  Takes far less time then you might
realize to max each level - only need five skill-ups, after all.  I do the
same with taunt - just pound my taunt hotkey as I'm fighting a monster.
Taunt goes up quick.

The only annoying skill to get up is Bind Wound, because each attempt takes
so long.  Fortunately this one goes up *very* quickly - as in every other
attempt - so all I have to do is wait until I fall below 50% health.

The key to all of this is to not get too far behind - do a little work after
each level-up to max out your skills.  Then it won't seem like so much of a
chore.  Spending five minutes to get Evocation from 95 to 100 is much less
annoying then spending an hour getting it from 9 to 100.

Alas, weapon skills are the one thing I cannot just simply spend a few
minutes maxing out each level.  Although I may try the trick of attacking a
yellow, getting it down to below 20 percent, then switching to a low-damage
weapon and constantly have it regen, run back, attack, let it run, regen,
run back, attack, etc.
