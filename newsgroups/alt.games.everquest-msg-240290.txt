I was not run out of the newsgroup Sisson ... I chose to leave because
idiots like you attacked me for simply asking the question why this
newsgroup out of all those that I use is the only one that canes top
posters.

You give true meaning to what the other Comonwealth countries think of
Canadians "Just Americans without brains".

No will uncloak .. the reason I cloaked in the first place was to help
people by email out of the 25 replies I have made to people only one
has got through.  Sad indictment on the fact that people cannot even
use emails that can be resolved ... including the leader of the Emarr
forum btw.

So Sisson, Dark Tyger and Bizbee you will now see my name again because
I want to help people unlike you.
