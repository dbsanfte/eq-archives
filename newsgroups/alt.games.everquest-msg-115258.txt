Still in the old world zones? Don't you get bored with that old world
kiting?

That would really require me to care now wouldnt it?  Yeah, as a warrior I
get so tired of people wanting me to play my class, taunt? kick? bash?  Why
cant I just play healer and bind wounds all day?

Yeah I agree its pretty silly to argue over that crappy Thurg quest armor.
Maybe kite some more and makre it to the higher level game, you might enjoy
it more.  4 friends? Sweet, can I join your fan club?

We have obviously clashed, its called a differance of opinion, you really
need to learn how to deal with other peoples opinions.  Maybe your kiting
too much? Ive heard EQ is a social game, maybe try grouping once and a
while?
