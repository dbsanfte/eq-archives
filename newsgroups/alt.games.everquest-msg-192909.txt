	For some reason, Qeynos Rangers get leather texture for their armor.
Everyone else gets their class texture: puntlings and Kelethin Rangers get
chain, Warriors get plate, etc.  But we get leather.  Tried complaining about
it to no use.

	If you were paying attention to the quest text, you'd have learned that
you need to sharpen the sword, and bring it back with certain other items to
get the finished Pine Scout Longsword.
