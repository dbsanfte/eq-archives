I know you are, I was trying to explain to all the Iksar, DE and other
Elves what it is like to be Mr Magoo after dark.

I strongly disagree (level 60 Human Ranger here BTW) that being
nightblind for a new character isn't a BIG hardship.  Its *nowhere*
near as bad since they upgraded the graphics a while back and made
everything "lighter" but when I was running some ATI piece of crap in
1999-2000 with the original engine a Greater Lightstone very often
made things only *just* playable in really dark places.  A Fire Beetle
eye just gave what little I could see a horrible yellowish tinge.

I'm talking at creation time: very ho-hum stats and nightblind for
Humans compared to the Elves who have ho-hum stats BUT racial
Infravision.

Helm of the Tracker is the [in]famous one, Tunare only with no Karana
equivalent.  Verant just added some race limited Bows and for no
discernable reason Karana worshippers get the shaft yet again.

Oh wait perhaps Verant is punishing them for worshipping the Rain
B*tch (anyone who ever levelled in any of the Karanas knows what I
mean here).  Forget what I said. :]
