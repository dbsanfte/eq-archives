I have never seen evidence that your kick skill affects ID and have in fact
only found evidence to the contrary.  Despite my having a kick skill of
about 40, when ID does actually do the kick, it lands most of the time,
probably 70%.  If I actually used kick in combat it would not land nearly
that often.  Also, I have seen my ID skill go up two times with only one
use, once after the first ID animation, and once after the kick.  It seems
to me that if the kick skill was actually being used for the second part of
ID, the kick skill would have gone up, not ID.  The kick animation has
tricked a lot of people into thinking the opposite.

Another thing I have noticed with ID is that it seems not to matter whether
or not you have used your special attack.  Unless there was some kind of odd
lag that made it appear differently, I have had ID successfully land with a
special attack greyed out.  This may have been an old bug that was stealth
fixed.
