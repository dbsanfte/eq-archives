Well... most of the ways to raise faction do hurt indigo brotherhood 
faction, as you noticed.  But they are mostly small hits (exception: 
helping a druid with the epic step in EK.  That was a big hit.  Ouch.)

So one thing you could do is raise your IB faction first, then go 
slaughter orcs.  Best way to do that is with the halfling raider helm 
quest.  You can monitor your IB faction by conning the DEs in Lesser Fay 
periodically.  Once you get up to dubious with wood elf warriors, you 
should be able to turn in shark meat in the emerald wariors guild.  I know 
this is a small hit to IB, as I turned in several stacks of shark meat 
without changing my IB faction once.

You might also try turning in muffins to pandos in freeport.  You're KoS 
to him, but maybe you can do it with sneak?  That only hurts crushbone 
orcs.
