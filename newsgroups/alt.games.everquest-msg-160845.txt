If you solo much beyond 39, you'll use mana up and have down time.
Fortunately, it takes a while, and I just try and be smarter with chant
kites as I get lower in mana. Really depends on your mana pool (which is INT
based BTW), and whether you have an FT items or not.

Dirge - the 43 song - can be considered to use up your entire mana pool in
one shot unless you have one heck of an INT. The song is a whopping 800 mana
pop, and so there's a reason why it's called the "Desparate" dirge. Only
time I use it is when I'm factioning on lower stuff or just passing by a
group of lower things and fell like having fun. For example, I have been
known to screw up my Qeynos faction, so I'll sometimes run by the bandits in
WK and drop 4 of them instantaneously with dirge (killing them is good
Qeynos faction) and loot their red sashs for turn in. Wastes the mana pool,
but it comes back before I'm doing anything serious anyway.
