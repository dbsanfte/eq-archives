I have a 27 paladin, and that subclass (follows from crusader 
class) appears to be rather strong for solo-ability. Among other 
benefits, paladins at level 20 get a summonable horse which serves 
as a sort of permanent SOW for escaping a losing fight.

Two things:

1) Decide early on to be a regular participant in the 
tradeskilling economy, which is far more robust than in EQ1. You 
can either decide to become a tradeskiller, or decide to become a 
serious harvester who supplies the tradeskillers. (I did the 
latter). In either case, this becomes a productive solo activity 
which you can do when you only have a half-hour to play or 
whatever. And in either case it can provide you a healthy cashflow 
in-game, and make you very popular in your guild if you join one. 
Your crafter/harvester level can keep pace nicely with your 
adventuring level, so that for example when you graduate to "Tier 
III" zones your harvesting skills are also graduating to "Tier 
III" harvests, etc.

2) Constantly get quests, bunching them in whatever zone(s) you 
are mainly hunting in at any given level range. You can easily 
have things such that basically any mob you kill counts towards 
some quest or other. This allows you to be flexible about joining 
groups (people will advertise that they are building a group to 
kill a certain type of mob or do a certain quest). That in turn 
makes finding a good group fast and easy.
