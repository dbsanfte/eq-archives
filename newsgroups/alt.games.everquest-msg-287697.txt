Raids buffs, debuffs, and auras stacking have been revamped, please
check this post for more information and our raid composition
simulation tool to see how it works now.
All TBC raid monsters will have their health reduced by about 30%.
(see this post)
The standard melee damage output will be reduced as well.
Boss abilities remain unchanged, except for Illidan who won't use
Shear anymore.

And the items has got changed:
+Healing and +Spell damage stats are being merged into a single +Spell
power stat. Healers' talents and spells have been updated accordingly
to compensate this change.
Items with magic school-specific damage like +shadow or +nature have
been converted to +spell power as well. This include most of the TBC
items except for some enchantments like Sunfire or Soulfrost.
Protection Paladin and Tanking Warrior sets to reflect changes on the
new mechanics. A lot of non set items are also being changed. See this
post.
