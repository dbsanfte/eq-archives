Subject: What the heck was this weapon I saw?

I was at one of the Wizzy spires, getting ready to take a trip to the Nexus. At
the spires was a player with a sword I've never seen before (1-hander, because
they were dual wielding; Centi Short Sword in the other hand): it looked like
it had electricity arching across the blade.

What was that weapon? I've never seen it before. I know it wasn't a Claw Of
Lightning (which I've never seen either), because the player wasn't a Rogue.
