Shrug.. its just a fact.   The intended progression route is get all 5 SolRo
mini flags, talk to the seer and the named drake outside PoF.

These 5 mini flags enable access into Solusek Ro's chamber, which (upon
killing him) enables access to Plane of Fire.

If you use 85% rule to get into SolRo's chamber tho, you no longer need the
mini flags.  Cuz mini flagged or not, you can zone into PoFire np.

Well this does seem specific to SolRo and PoFire.
I do agree with you, in general about missed flags, though.
