No offense, but I'm not sure why you're working your panties into a bunch.
Those dreadful RPers you're so worried about, wearing the level appropriate
gear of 3 years ago are also busy fighting the level appropriate mobs of
3 years ago. That rp'ing 22 warrior in banded+bronze is fighting aviaks
in SK just like they did in Ye Olden Days. You've no doubt got your 22
warrior in Fierce Heraldic Plate camping Trakanon or other that has the
"significant risk" factor you blather on so about. You'll never meet. Why
does it bother you so that there are folks out there having fun while
playing in the non-kaev approved way?
