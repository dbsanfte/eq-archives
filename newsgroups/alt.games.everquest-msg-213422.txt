Whats hard about a shaman spam curing the MA, whether its nToV or PoEB
warlord
Its something I've done more than once, I know how "difficult" it is

Who cares if its not optimal mana usage; when a mob is trivial you hardly
care.  When we use wizards, mages, clerics as the MA on 1k+ hitting mobs,
its because the fight is gimp anyway and people want to liven it up

Well this was early Luclin, so you can half that 8k..

Shrug who cares for 1 mob.  You don't need mana when its dead.. and most old
world content, clerics mana regen keeps up pretty good that they have a
surpless at the end of the fight anyway

If it doesn't result in a wipe I couldn't care less who wants to tank the
named on 3am 3-4 group vt clears

Oh and when the mage tanked ahr, there were 3 clerics present - feel the
zerg omfg!
