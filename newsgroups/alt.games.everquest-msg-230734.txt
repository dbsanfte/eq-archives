Nukes aren't interchangeable like that - I'm frequently in a position 
where my best nuke, Black Steel, is useless and I have to fall
back on SoFB.  If I had Sun Vortex, there would likewise be many 
places where it was useless.  FoT is situational - where I need
High DPS, Mana isn't a concern, and I have clear LOS on non-walled
mobs - it is the bomb :).  Oh, and FoT is vendor bought, and actually
more expensive than the ep spells now.
