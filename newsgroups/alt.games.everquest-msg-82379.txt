Mm'kay, a little more here... While I agree that the person in
question was being rather anal... To me, the "darker side of human
interaction" would be knowingly violating the rules of the game
they're playing, not trying to keep the playing field clean. Anal
player writing names down or not, if you break the rules and get
punished for it, it's your own damn fault. NOBODY else's.
