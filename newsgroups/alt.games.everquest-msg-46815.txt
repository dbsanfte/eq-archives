When you pass the PoD, go over the bridge, pass through the large up/down
gate, then you turn left through a smaller gate to approach the Down
Under --- do you know that spot?  THAT smaller gate is exactly where I
crash, multiple times.  The first couple of times, I thought it was my
system or something, but it's that spot.  I can go around through the water
to the docks and approach around the 'back' of the zone.  I've also had it
once or twice coming from 3rd Gate, right at the exit to the zone-in
hallway.
My problem is that as a HEF Rogue with MoD, I'm still KoS to the guards
(very friendly with mask) so I've got to be pretty darn quick with that Hide
button upon logging back in!
