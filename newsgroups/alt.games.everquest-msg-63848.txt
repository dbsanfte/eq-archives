The name violates none of the rules.  I think valleys and red wine are 
perfectly legitimate Norrathian images.  Especially given that the 
character in question is a master brewer with Alcohol Tolerance 200. :)

I feel that it comes far closer to violating the letter of the rules than 
the spirit.  But you are welcome to your own opinion, of course.  It is 
impossible to choose a name that will bother absolutely no one... I'm sure 
there are those players who don't understand why anyone would choose a 
name that is -not- in dewdspeak.  Which is why there are rules, to 
distinguish the gripes that Verant chooses to legitimize from those they 
do not.

I'm sorry if it disturbs you, but I'm keeping it. :)
