Heck, you could even make it a requirement for a guild to have a hall.  Have
a certain capacity, and every member must have a bed.  In exchange, you
could have things that can only be done at a hall, like certain tradeskills,
or improvements to tradeskills.  Heck, you could even have a construction
tradeskill.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
