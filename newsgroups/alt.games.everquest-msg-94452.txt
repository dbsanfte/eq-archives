Most "Exploration Teams" rely on Tanks (eg War, SKs, Pal), Healers
(Clr, Dru, Sha), Crowd Control (Enchanter, Bard), Damage
Dealers/Corpse Recovers (Rogue, Monk), and Evac'ers (Dru, Wiz).

Why are Rangers or Druids "key" classes to an exploration team?

Tracking (Ran, Dru, Brd):
Tracking is nice, but you have to know what is in the zone to make use
of it, It can give you a rough idea of mob density and level, but is
is not essential to exploring. Tracking will not tell you agro ranges,
or mob type (war, wiz, SK, necro, etc), and it will not tell you if a
mob can be mezzed, slowed, or if it gates/summons.

Evacuation (Dru):
Also nice when exploring, but Wizards can evac as well.

SoW:
Nice to have, but not required to explore.

Camo:
Most other classes can Invis through items, spells or potions.

No one has said that there were no Rangers or Druids in the
"exploration teams". Just because they were not singled out for
special mention, doesn't mean they were not there. Even if niether
class was represented, the outcome would most likely have been the
same. From initial reports the new CT is as tough as some of the
hardest zones in Velious and SoL.
