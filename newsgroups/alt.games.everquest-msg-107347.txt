I put symbol on the MA, the chanter, and maybe, maybe, on myself, 90% of
the
time.  Its not the cash, or the slots wasted, its the sheer mana expense
to cast
a buff that -should- be unneccessary.  Usually groups want to form up, get
in
there, and get moving, in short order.  They also don't really want to
take long
breaks midstream.

On the MA, that symbol pays for itself in mana spent every single time I
slap
a  CHeal on... I get that much more healing out of the thing.

On the chanter... well, anything, anything at all, I can do to keep the
chanter
alive, I'm for it.  And they are so very fragile, HB plus symbol can
double
their HP totals.

So I'm keeping two or three symbols on for several hours, I've blown what,

a hundred PP all told?  At level 44 when peridot first were needed for
symbol, this was serious enough money.  By my 50s though, its entirely
chump change.  I don't count symbols cast, and when people ask how many
I've cast I mock them for it.  Doing so (like turning down money for Rez
most
of the time) gives me far more pleasure than the PP would.  Thats a
personal
choice though, 90% of groups immediately offer to reimburse my peridot
expenses before splitting loot, and I seriously doubt the other 10% of the

groups I've been in would have blinked if I'd asked for it.

Given that I'm a dwarven cleric (current CHA a whopping 50 due to some
plus CHA gear) I'd rather be given actual peridot than cash, but cash is
the
simplest thing to pull out of the split.  Makes almost no sense to give me

gem drops, I'm surely the person who will get the -least- cash for them,
instead have the chanter/bard fire up faction/race/cha to the wall and do
the selling for the group, splitting cash instead.
