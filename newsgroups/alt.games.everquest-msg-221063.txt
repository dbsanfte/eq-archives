    It's more than that. I've seen responsible wizards in my XP groups get
summoned mid-fight because they got a big crit, something they cannot
control. The wizards also can't control how many times a warrior's aggro
crutch weapons proc. Put yourself in the wizard's shoes. In fight one
against mob type X, you cast twice after two minutes and get no aggro.
Second fight, you do the exact same thing and get a few rounds of smacking
for it. Third fight, you do the exact same thing and the warrior can't get
it off you with a crowbar. So how do you determine when to nuke and how
often? Why bother with this warrior stuff when the paladin you're with
generates most of his hate in precise amounts at precise times, making
determining a nuking schedule easy?

    The problem is that the class of people they don't group well with is
"those who do damage with spells".
