Hmm, if you want to seperate the two, I think I've seen deliberate KSing 
  only four or five times, and camp jumping another four or five 
times... outside of some more recent experience in Paladul where people 
would come into a camp and start taking half the mobs.  Forced sharing, 
it seemed, had become a norm on the Luclin server at B1.  They didn't 
try to kick anyone out, mind you, they just assumed that they could 
share with you, without asking.  And they were right, the official rules 
call for that as the solution, not the lists or claims that players 
generally recognize elsewhere in the game.

I don't think the EQ2 locking solution offers any respite from camp 
jumping, and precious little for forced camp sharing, does it?
