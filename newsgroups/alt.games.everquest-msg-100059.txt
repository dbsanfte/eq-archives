It is a bit of both.
There is a limit of range (which is dependent on your skill level)
If a mob is in range, then it is sorted by spawn time.

For example if my druid zones into WW and I hit track it only lists
about 3 or 4 mobs since the distance fromthe zone in to the nearest mobs
path is quite a long way.

The order of those 3 or 4 mobs is by spawn time.

HTH,
