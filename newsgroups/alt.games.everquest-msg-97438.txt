This has been debated on the beastlord forums - without a 
pet your damage output is dramatically lessened (like a 
mage's).  With a shaman there, your spells are less than
useful, so you end up being a melee with damage output a
bit under a SK or Pally.  I understand why pets aren't allowed
in many raid situations.  I couldn't use one in DN, because
of the mob who DT's in there.  (apparently the pet and some
illusions get you on his hate list - I didn't try.)  Also,
many raid leaders won't let you use them in Hate (pathing),
and ToV (ae from other mobs causes the pet to charge off, and
cause a train on the group - /pet hold will fix that, but
that is a *LOONG* way off.)  Also, with the confirmation of the
4 pet limit per mob, if there are 4 pet casters with more
effective pets at the raid, you will probably not get to use
it.  For the sake of Mages, Necros and Beastlords, these issues
really need to be addressed.

OTOH - BL's bring a lot to an XP group, able to fill in slowing
duty when a shammy isn't there, or the chanter/bard can't carry
it.  This in addition to great damage output (BL + pet).
