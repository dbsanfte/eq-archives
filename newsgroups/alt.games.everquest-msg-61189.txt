I doubt it's been nerfed. Just a run of bad luck. I leveled my necro
from 5 to 12 in EC/WC just like you. I wasn't specifically hunting
wisps, but I nailed them when they wandered by and were blue. I got two
backpacks of GLS just randomly hitting them. Seemed normal drop rate to
me. 

I thought the same thing about the gargoyle eye drop rate in OoT a few
days ago, but I logged on there last night and got five in the first
seven gargs. Just that whacky random number generator thingy, I'm
guessing.
