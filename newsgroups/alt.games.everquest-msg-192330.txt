Introduction
1. Where is this guide from? � My 3 years hand playing experience
This almost 70 pages guide is from my first-hand, 3 years experience
playing Everquest. Following this guide, you should easily level from
1 to 30 in 2 weeks, or from 1 to 40 in 3 weeks. Meanwhile, you will
earn substantial amount of money to buy your dream equipments. I have
11,000 pp in bank when my first player was level 40, after spending
thousands on equipments. You can do better than me with this guide. By
the end of your first month Everquest subscription, you will travel
around with a much respected/admired mid to high 40s character with
shining armor and powerful weapons.

You think you are leveling too slowly and you are poor. With this
essential guide, you will be able level and get rich at the fastest
pace possible. All these techniques are very practical and I have done
them many times to verify.

special guides organized in a well-defined copy-righted electronic

leveling & platinum making guide, you get all the other guides free.
You can't find other guides even similar to the first 6 guides. Why,
because these are hard earned first hand playing experience.

2. Guide on tons of general Everquest playing tips, many of them are
