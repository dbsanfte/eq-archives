Having found this out the hard way, I can tell you that they eat them. I
have to make periodic runs to SH to stock up on stacks of iron rations
to keep in the top inventory slots so he wont' "eat up all the profits"
of the 10 lb. Halas Pies and the Truffles.

However, since we're not selling any beverages, I'm currently letting
the poor bastard wither away from dehydration.

I should note, by the way, that these aren't my baking products, but my
wife's.  But I have to deal with the mule enough that I get to
experiment with all these little things. She's making about a 400%
profit margin on her baking skillup wares, and that's selling cheaper
than I've seen anyone else sell them for. Last night she made just over
1K PP on items that it cost her 250 plat to bake up. A 750 plat profit
while you are sleeping ain't too shabby. Plus, when she woke up, she
found some 59 or 60 necro spell for sale for 750 plat in an amazing
deal, so the baking nearly paid for that! (Lich or Demi-lich or somesuch
thing. Used to sell for a LOT more in the /auction channel, pre-bazaar
days.)
