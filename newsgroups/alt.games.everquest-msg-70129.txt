I had this flickering problem in the med screen for ages.  It turned out to be
caused by an Audio program for my Sound Blaster Live!. If you are using that
card, there are two ways to fix it:

1) Shut that program down.  The icon is in the lower right hand end of the task bar.
    Right-click it and select "Exit".  That program is not needed for sound.

2) Install the latest software for the SB Live! card from www.creative.com.

I don't know for sure if 2) fixes it, but I haven't had the problem since I did that.
(however the sound program is currently shut off, so I don't recall for sure if I ran
EQ with it on)

Anyway, I hope this helps.  The flickering in the med screen is quite annoying and
made me feel oddly nauseated.
