Twinking only takes a player so far.  Far more important is the experience that
comes with having played several characters of various types up through the
levels, and fought in most of the zones, and knowing all the "sweet spots" for
leveling, and the few useful quests for cash and xp.
  Starting out fresh, but knowing nobody, you'll still be basically alone until
you start making lots of friends and allies. You'll still be the low level
character with the tattered armor and rusty weapons for a while. Everyone has to
go through it. It's just part of the process.
  However, you can rest assured that people from other servers with all that
expereince are already planning to go there and start out a new character. They
will be ready to start grouping together immediately, playing insane amounts of
time, and racing to get to the top first.
  I predice that the new RP server will have an upberguild inside of six weeks.
Two months tops.
