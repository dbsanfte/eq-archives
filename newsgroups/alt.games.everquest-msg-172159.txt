 I've thought about this too but couldn't never think of a way that it
could be visualised that either didn't look crowded on the screen or created
too much lag (how cool would residual graphics effects on the mob be?
crawling roots around the feet for root and snare for the duration of the
spell, etc).

 One thing I did /feedback on the other night as I was awaiting a train/pull
from our hyper tank was this: similar to the links that we can do in chat
now, it would be a nice feature to add to the %T macro such that when the
viewer saw it the expansion of that macro (i.e. "a Seafury Cyclops") would
be colored the appropriate /con color for the viewer.

 For instance, puller hotkeys "/g incoming %T"
 Group sees "Puller tells the group, 'incoming Mountain Giant Craig'"
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 The words "Mountain Giant Craig" could be blue to one group member but
white or yellow to another depending on their level. Something simple like
this would help in the decision making process for some groups and raids,
speeding them up and simplifying spell choices, camping calls, etc.

 Just a thought and one I took some time to send in as /feedback so maybe,
just maybe... :-)
