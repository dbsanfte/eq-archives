Heh, lucky cat. Well, I wouldn't go as far as to say that you got the 
"better card", the 6800 Ultra is a sweet videocard and generally performs 
better than the 9800 Pro in most of the reports I've seen. But when it comes 
to EQ2, you're absoultely right, it's the "better card". At least, today. 
Hopefully these guys will get their act together. SOE says they are working 
hard with nVidia on the problems and have asked people to stop posting on it 
already hehe.
