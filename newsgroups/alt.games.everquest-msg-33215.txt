On a can of Peanuts:

"Caution: MAY contain peanuts."

On a can of mixed nuts:
"Caution: This product MAY contain nuts.  This product is produced in a
facility which also processes peanuts."

on that same can:
"Ingredients: ... peanuts, ... "

Wow, that must be efficient, processing peanuts in the same facility that
produces a can in which a quantity of peanuts are placed.

I understand that of all food allergies, peanuts is the most deadly... but
uh, if you're allergic to peanuts, are you going to buy ANYTHING that has a
giant spectacled peanut for a logo?  Nevermind has a 54point white on blue
type label which reads "PEANUTS."  Unless, of course you are warned by that
6point type caution that advises you that there may be peanuts in that can
of peanuts.
