Leveling is a slow process as most people on this thread have mentioned.  I
usually don't rush to level as I like to explore.  The only caveat I throw
out, as alot of people will also probably agree is that I generally make
ingame friends while leveling.  I like to group with them, but if I'm off
putzing around while they are leveling, at some point they are too high to
group with.  Some of my friends are laid back levelers, so we generally keep
up.  Well, on the flip side, you get to meet and make new friends

I wouldn't say they deserver respect in that they are great players.  They
have just played that character longer.  There is no advanced gameplay skill
required to level high... you just play learn the nuances of your character
and continue doing what you have been doing.  Most average non-twinked
characters will take many RL months to reach high levels... and if you want
to obtain lvl 60, well that tends to really take a long time.
