Heck I have played 3 classes past 50 and 3 others past 40, I still don't
assume I know everything about any class.  A "why?" as opposed to an
arbitrary "no" on things I don't agree with is my tactic.  There just
may be a dang good reason why this person wants something I don't think
makes sense.  By at least hearing them out I have either an opportunity
to explain why I still don't agree or to understand something that makes
me agree.  That's not only an immediate advantage but I may well come
away with knowledge I can use in the future.
