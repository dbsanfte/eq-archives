Yep.  I certainly won't claim that the cleric epic is the worst, not
by any stretch.  It was certainly 'epic enough' for me, a casual
player, however!

That's kind of my plan - avoidance.  I may be back for some GW farming
though.  We're keeping an eye on this whole int casters can make wis
caster spells development.  Our 58 shaman is especially excited.

In hindsight, the Chardok encounter seems to sum up the cleric epic,
doesn't it?  The other stuff is all "do-able" by a small/casual guild.

Hmm.. that's not really true either.  My guild couldn't have done it 6
months ago, but we've all leveled a bit.

Hehe - good, I'm not the only one then!  OH - and I hit something last
night with it.  New record for Darken, a 51pt hit.  Lol!

Oh yes.  I was grouping with a warrior, druid and wizard last night in
one of them new zones whose name won't stick in my brain.  Warrior
crumbled *just* as the CH landed (ain't that almost always the way?).
Druid rooted the mob as I was already clicking the rez.  Warrior was
back in 40 seconds - and I'm not out the mana.  I'm going to love this
thing!
