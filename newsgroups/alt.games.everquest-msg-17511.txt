If a mob can be slowed, it ain't uber.
Shamans are needed for two things:  Buffs and Malo.  And the latter is
largely optional (and most of the time useless).

If you could get Turgur to stick on some of the uber mobs, those uber
mobs would become a joke.

They changed Cazic Thule specifically to have him resist Turgur
because prior to that, even the "buffed" CT was a joke once you got
Turgur on him.
