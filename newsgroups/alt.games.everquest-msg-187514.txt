With a cleric, I'd play a Shadow Knight.  Many of the abilities of a Paladin
will be overwritten by the Cleric, so you end up significantly wasting a
good portion of a Paladin's worth (which isn't much anyways).  Unless you're
fighting undead, melee is the only part of paladinhood that will stack with
the cleric.

OTOH, A shadow knight brings many toys to the table that a cleric doesn't
override, with their DoT's and debuffs.  The overlap isn't as large, and the
SK's abilities don't end up going to waste.

Paladins have their place, but a cleric is just to similar to get the
maximum benefit out of the class.  For a paladin, try grouping with a shammy
or dr...dru.... ach, I can't say it.  Better yet, go with an enchanter or
Bard, and you have almost no overlap at all, plus crowd control, plus slow,
and even a snare with the bard (works well with ranger and paladin pair,
too... I've had alot of fun with that duo), and your heals all of the
sudden, aren't "also rans."
