DE Necros are not KOS in East or West Freeport.  Don't try going to North
till you've killed a bunch of DF orcs though.  It's pretty hard to get
around Faydwer though as you will be KOS to all elves, dwarves, and I
believe gnomes but I'm not positive about that.  I'm also pretty sure you're
KOS to (non-corrupt) Qeynos guards but that's not a problem since they're
easy to avoid (except in Qeynos obviously).  You're also not at any
disadvantages to other races in Kunark, at least at lower levels.  Basically
it's not a problem at all once you learn what will kill you.  It's very easy
to avoid things that don't like you.  I'm not sure about weapons.
