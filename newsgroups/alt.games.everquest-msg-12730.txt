I'm saying that I did just fine without SoW until I got the spell for
myself, and my non-druids that reached higher levels than 14 did just fine
without the buff.

I'm saying that anyone who thinks they should ask for a spell that I KNOW
they don't need are beggars.  Using the loosest possible definition of
"need" meaning "HAVING to run 3+ zones" (as opposed to "WANTING" to run
them, such as a level 5 gnome WANTING to run to Freeport/NRo to hunt when
there's perfectly good places much closer).

At higher levels running 3+ zones are too often necessary.  Even then SoW
isn't needed, but as long as someone isn't a jerk about it they'll get SoW
from me if they ask.
