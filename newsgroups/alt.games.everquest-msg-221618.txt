Hello DTyger,

You are told this by people who want to exploit your services in order
that
they may achieve their desired drops from the planes and flaggings.

Look, people want want want want.  Peolpe in the game are VERY
COMPULSIVE and
will do just about anything to "keep up with the jones's".

LDON is DAMN fantastic AA exp.  On a slaughter mission "NORMAL" I earn
70 PCT AA in about 45 min!  PLANES DON'T DO THAT!   On a "Hard"
mission the exp is about 1 AA in about 70 min!  PLANES DON'T DO THAT!

After we sell gems, and other dropped items and split plat, my share
runs 200pp - 600pp every 45 min ... again PLANES DON'T DO THAT!  Sorry
Charlie, the PLANES don't do that!

In about 2 months of playing LDON, I have earned 80 AAs, over 50k pp +
over 100k pp selling LDON dropped items.

Also,  I have all the top armor and focus effects from the Adventure
merchants.  I also have a couple of No Drop "Hard Setting" drops that
puts the Planar drops to to shame!

Sorry I am not going to be a slave to a few greedy self-centered, ass
hole, guild leaders/officers/lame-O-guildies ... no no no no NO!  I
can stand on my own abilities and not have to "merge" my talents with
others who frankly don't give a damn about anyone except themselves!

LDON is salvation! I recommend it to all EQ'ers!

Ted.

P.s. lately I sure see alot of HIGH END UBER GUILD types playing LDON
... I wonder why?  Shouldn't you bastards be up in PoT where all the
pretty people play? HAHAHAHAHAHA ... we know the reason!  :)
