 Raid XP is way lower than it needs to be. Try having just two groups in
raid and you'll notice it. Those people who are 65 definitely did not
get there by being in raid groups.

 Oh they thought of it because they fucked us from levelling just about
anywhere else. Once you hit 61 a lot of the mobs that were dark blue go
green or light blue. I'm sure Cazic Thule is probably blue. Deep
Chardok. Ssra. Add in VP and VT if you have the keys and you've just
about covered them all. Even zones like Disease and Innovation go light
blue at 62-63 although you can find higher levels deeper in. It's
ridiculous that ANY mob in a PoP zone will go light blue to a level 65
player.

 
 People are rushing through 65 because levels > all. It's always been
like that. Plus once they get the levels out of the way they can work on
AA and take it easy. PoP zones are only going to get more and more
crowded as the number of people who can XP outside of PoP decreases.
