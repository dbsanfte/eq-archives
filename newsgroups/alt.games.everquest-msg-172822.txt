I sent an email to this persons server at abuse@alt.net

They have a whacky confirm you are not a spammer reply message, but,
maybe someone will get tired of the complaints and shut this whacko's

It's not the message, it's the flood based nature of the spam that
bugs me. People are entitled to their whacky opinions...
