    Ayup. In our case rods didn't run out so much as rods were placed in bad
spots. If the clerics aren't tightly clumped around their mage, then the
mage moves to cleric A to drop a rod in front of him. Cleric B sees a rod in
front of A, needs a rod, goes and takes A's rod. Now A is running around
looking for the rod in front of cleric C. And so on.

    Five? Last Emperor run our first main tank blew through two full pods on
incoming. Glad they're cheap to recharge, or I'd never see the outside of
Fungus Grove come XP time.

    Proximity. We had one warrior during our practice runs tank him through
several de-aggro procs just because he was closest by a fair margin. Poo and
proximity = one Emperor glued to you.

    Unequip weapons. Even our paladins have to do that because of how slow
those darned things regen.

    Was it Evasive? Some of our warriors have been experimenting with that
as per the guidelines on Steel Warrior. So far, the results have been
mixed - we've seen some good saves when a /disc cycles faster but we've also
been hit with the "bad rounds" that don't happen when you use Defensive. I
think it might be better in situations where defensive is being used not
because the tank will die without out, but just to save healer mana. Like on
the high HP trash mobs we'll be seeing in VT soon. =)

    We had 80 of ours, and 55 from one of the two other Ssra guilds. It will
never get any better, I'm afraid.

    Today should be interesting. The guild that used to be number one on our
server, Vis Maior, has asked for a shot at Emperor today. And without
prompting, they've offered to give us whatever drops off Blood in order to
get that shot. They recently lost over a dozen of their best-equipped
members to a new guild, so it should be interesting to see first-hand how
they do and how they approach the fight (we'll have people in the room to
loot). We THINK they're a lot further back than they do - they just
discovered the line-of-sight room-wide aggro, for instance - but we'll see!
