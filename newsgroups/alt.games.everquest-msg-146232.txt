Last night, at about 9PM Mountain time, once again, our epicless rogue
handed in her book, or whatever it is she hands in, and, no General.  This
is getting pretty fucking ludicrous.  This makes zero for two now.
Petitioned again, and I guess, so far, no results from the petition.

On the bright side, we did get to see what shaman wear under their kilts.
In kithicor, maybe elsewhere, if a shaman cast bearform, then clicked it
off, he would appear with no clothes but skintight boxer shorts on.  If he
cast greater bear form and clicked it off, he would appear wearing a really
cool, ok, over the top tacky, outfit.  I'll have to see about posting a link
to some pictures.
