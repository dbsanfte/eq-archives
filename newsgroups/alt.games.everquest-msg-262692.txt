One of the reasons we carved out Israel and continue to support the
Israeli's is to cultivate instability in the Middle East, my opinion
only here.  If they are allowed to focus their efforts outside of the
region, terrorism may very well be the least of our worries.

Sure it has something to do with oil, you can boil down probably all
of histories wars to greed in some fashion.  As long as our economy
runs on it our government will do what it thinks necessary to secure
it.  Good or bad that's the way it is and it's true for every
politician, except maybe Carter.  I thought he was one of the worst
President's we ever had but maybe the best man the position has ever
seen.
