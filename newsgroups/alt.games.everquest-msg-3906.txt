Oh, now there's a "fix" in search of a problem. Meanwhile, NPCs can attack
you through walls and floors and teleport to you if you manage to run where
they can't follow in a straight line. REAL bugs get ignored (or provoke some
lame cop-out response -- as if teleporting orcs is really part of
the"vision", yeah, right), but instead they spend their time playing
three-card monte with the spell components and arbitrarily changing how long
food lasts and how heavy containers are.

Don't expect Verant to tell you. Hey, they might, but I'll be surprised if
they do. You and I, the players, are at the bottom of their list of
priorities.
