I realize that it's really pathetic to follow up to one of your own
posts, but is the progression of pathetic after that geometric or
exponential?  

Anyway, reasons I shouldn't be allowed to have money, part 153.  After
a horrible night of grouping and remembering why I prefer soloing, I
run Atticus back to the bazaar.  I managed to sell some stuff on my
vendor mule and I have a guildie transfer the roughly 2200pp to Att.
It's late (about 4am Arizona time) and I'm going to log, but first I
decide to /baz and see what's up.

Yes, I'm a dumbass.

I see lots of neat stuff that I can't afford, naturally.  Can't afford
that CoF.  Can't afford that PoP bow somebody is selling for 250,000pp
(40/34 and more stats than I wanna think about).  Looking at weapons I
see a Defenders Lightblade
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=17200) selling for
1800pp.

So, now I'm poor again.  Now the reason I'm writing this, other than
extreme sleep deprivation, is what should I keep in the main hand?

I have a Defiance
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4318) and the Jade
Mace (9/18 no stats so you don't get a link), and a Venomous Axe of
the Velium Brood
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6285) which is more
than likely getting given to my vendor mule.

With my crappy 22% haste, the Jade Mace and the Defiance are both
going to be about 9/15ish by my calculations, and the Lightblade is
going to be 20/27 for Att since he's only 51.  That makes the
Lightblade look better since the ratio is like .74 (will jump to .84
when I get 56) and the ratio on the Defiance (my preference for AC and
stats) is only .6.  But when you through the damage bonus (8 for all
my 1h weapons) in on top of that is when I get all fucked up.

So, what's better?  Defiance in the main hand and Lightblade in the
off hand?  Lightblade in the main and Defiance in the off?  Or should
I just try and turn the Lightblade around and sell it for a profit
because I shouldn't have bought it in the first place?  And finally,
who invented liquid soap and why? (Name the movie and when nothing at
all.)

Thank you and blog bless.
