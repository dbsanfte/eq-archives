While looking at the Monkly Business
(http://www.monkly-business.com) message boards, I came upon
a "community interview" with several EQ game designers
answering questions about the upcoming Shadows of Luclin (I
tracked down the official transcript at EQStratics at
http://eq.stratics.com/content/irc/eqhoc_oct022001.shtml).
Yakatizma, aka Dan Enright, answered the following question:

***** QUOTE *****
AnnaT:  Are beastlord casters, tanks, meele casters? What
are their stregths?

Yakatizma:  Beastlords are a melee/shaman hybrid with the
melee aspect leaning more towards a monk than a warrior.
They have some of the special properties of a monk such as
an unencumbered armor class bonus, better ac bonus for high
agility and are second only to monks in unarmed combat
damage. Like a monk they will have to rely on tanks or their
pet to soak up a large percentage of the damage that would
otherwise be directed at them.. In addition to their pet
enhancement spells they will also receive some unique
non-pet oriented beastlord spells and spells from their
Shaman parent class. You can think of them as primitive
spiritual warriors with close ties to the wild and the
shamanistic cultures they emerge from.
***** END QUOTE *****

Of particular interest is where one of the chief game
designers stated that, LIKE MONKS, Beastmasters will have
"better ac bonus for high agility", thus proving once and
for all that AGI is more important to monks than it is for
any other class by improving armor class. Most telling is
that not one of the other game designers and producers
involved in the forum contradicted Yakatizma.

So, anyone on Xev interested in Wu's Fighting Armor? Each
piece has 1 to 4 AGI and I have three nearly full suits in
stock at the moment (just look for Rosewhite Blossom or any
other member of the Povar-Tarew Artisans guild.)
