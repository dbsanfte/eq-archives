Not really good by 65 standards, no, but i figured it completes the set

There's quite a variety of mobs in there.  The fire giants are fun. 
Guild raided to the Fireback Queen once too.  She is untargetable until 
you kill the waves of spiders that spawn once you kill the 4 spiders 
initially in the room with her.  Think it was around 30 spiders before 
she could be targeted (she is lvl 68).  The fire giants used to path 
rather poorly, giving our monk puller 3-4 that he had trouble splitting. 
  Now, the pathing is much better and even when a pacification was 
resisted my cleric only got one :)

The crawl thru is fun.  There are assorted goo's, imps, bugs, and demon 
looking types (Fireborn Master, etc).  My war has been collecting bits 
for the haste cloak quest (no luck last night on getting the bit he 
needs from spiders).  It is very similar to a CoF in stats and is 
tradable.

I tracked down a ranger friends sk-alt's corpse in solb.  Was funny cuz 
after him go left, me's found him corpse in rightmost lava tunnel...

PS Sorry for delay responding, I seem to multitask very poorly lately, I 
always seem to be last in guildchat to pipe up with a hiya :(  Bugs me.
