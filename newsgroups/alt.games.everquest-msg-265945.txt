    Why do you assume that I have no experience in playing online games and
computer games in general?
    As for your second tactic of "Look folks, his opinion is worthless
because other people like it."  Poor trolling form.

    Well, EverQuest is 5 years running.  An impressive showing on stamina
over suck-factor.  That means they have found their core audience and will
keep it until the "Boredom Factor" is too much.  Like, oh I don't know,
camping for hours waiting for a boss monster to be toting some imaginary
trinket of great value.  Yawn.  The suck-factor on "Asheron's Call" was a
lot lower than "NeverFun", but they never fixed the serious gameplay bugs
promptly.

    By the way, your disagreement with my opinion is noted.
    And frankly, since you have tried 2 weakass debating tactics already my
opinion of you has dropped.
    Does the little baby cry so loud because someone else DARES have an
opinion differing from poor little baby?

    So now, bored with attacking me for a second, the bawling infant attacks
the information posted and the person that created that information.
    The POINT of the clip was to note that, "Golly an angry subscriber base
usually won't likely become customers again."

    So... are you defending a prized toy or are you attempting to do
"marketing containment" of a severely dissatisfied customer of Verant's
hostile incompetence?  I suspect that some Sony shills are lurking here
trying to figure out what "City of Heroes" is doing right that they are not
(have yet to read 100's upon 100's of angry customers posting here like they
did in the EverQuest newsgroup daily when I was reading it).  Simply put,
COH has a dramatically lower suck-factor in exchange for less content.
Granted, there isn't the joyless tedium of crafting (a way to kill time
between suck-waits in camping in NeverFun), but COH has worked to remove the
suck-factor as much as workable.

    Again, an attack on my assumed lack of knowledge and experience and now
an attack on a fellow that has observed a number of online game marketing
models and player retention concepts and assume that he also must be
ignorant because HE DISAGREES WITH YOU.

    Hey crying baby, other people have opinions so get used to it.

    It honestly looks like they changed their business model and are more
promptly responding to legitimate complaints of their customers now that I
review the EverQuest newsgroup today.  Good for them.  Perhaps Sony will
become a legitimate business once again after the shame of being exposed for
using FAKE PAID SHILL REVIEWERS for their products and movies.

|
| Of course. But not to the extent you have claimed.


    Finally a glimmer of humility.
    When I played it, the game had "anti-cheat" crap code that allowed
monsters to strike through walls and enter buildings without pause (to
correct the "exploit" of going inside a safe room and shutting the door
while a Damage Over Time spell killed the monster.  This code meant that
there were no "perching exploits" like walking in a dungeon and getting
killed by an untargetable monster 5 floors beneath you that aggro'ed you.

    Then we add in fun stuff like vendors stuck on roofs constantly.  Crowds
of severely bored players waiting for monsters to spawn because the next
zone out was insanely deadly and the zone before that was useless.  So
there'd be 20 players all standing around waiting for a monster to spawn
just so they'd have SOMETHING to do.  And the jolly quests which required a
KEYWORD, but often had a different keyword required than highlighted.

    Lanterns that were perfectly useless in the nightime zones because
triangles of ground patches would not increase brightness on adjoining
triangle sections.  And then we add in the ever-tedious "Where's my dead
body?" minigame... SUCK.

    Any of this stupid crap fixed YET?!?

    BTW --- I just used GOOGLE to review my posts over NeverFun while I
played it...
    Wow, I really should check up on some of the more interesting people
from that time.


| >    [continuing the article -- but skipping over signifigant observations
| >why Ultima has a better design]
|
| Ah so you are snipping the inherent bias of the author? Figures.
|
| Time for you to go back to your cave, noob.

    Fine... since you assume me ignorant, I shall consider you dimwitted.
    NeverFun set my personal standard of poor business practices in action,
Microsoft cemented that outlook.


    My QUIT POST for NeverFun is below, by the way (sheesh, it only took me
30 days to get sick of it... I thought it was much longer for the pure suck
of it).  When I first started playing I wanted to see the vast world and
experience the flavor of the game.  I played a Necromancer Gnome, a Wizard,
a Dark Elf, a Erudite, and a Barbarian.  The cities were pretty (big
frickken' poly objects in review of my memory now), but hollow of character.
The backstory seemed less interactive than clicking a plaque and reading it.
Frankly, I stuck around on the EverQuest newsgroup purely because I was
HOPING that Verant would pull their heads out of their asses and fix the
game rather than keep adding in more hackwork "patches" and class-nerfing.
When I gave up on that, I simply blacklisted EverQuest from ever being worth
consideration in my mind.  That is why I still consider it "NeverFun" ---
because in that game, I honestly never left happy from one play session to
the next.  It was one long empty tedious grind.

    So yeah.  I moved onto "Asheron's Call" and played other computer games
at the time.  I waited for "Asheron's Call" to fix the distance-rendering
bugs and crazy aiming bugs and the screwed up teaming aspects.  They never
did while I was there so I left after a while.  At the moment I view "City
of Heroes" to have the best staying power (it works with a variety of play
styles and has a suck-factor so minimal that it is as simple as a game of
Checkers or Tic-Tac-Toe to get back into from day to day).  Sure, the
backstory needs work being fleshed out and it needs a larger "Dollhouse"
factor (which should arrive in "City of Villains").

    "City of Heroes" has enough interaction that boredom isn't an issue.  It
has enough action to give a sense of purpose (although there needs to be an
improvement on the NPC citizen tracks and perhaps patrolling outdoor foes).
It isn't so complicated that a thick book is required for play and not so
simple as to dull the mind.  The punishments for failure are simply a
slowdown and there is no "being knocked 2 days back" upon a death.  There is
the ability to emotionally invest in the game, but not enough trauma to
cause a person to obsess over it.

    Simply put, at the moment "City of Heroes" has ample happiness-factor to
keep me coming back.
    Yeah, it is repetitive, but I'm not bored of it and I certainly have no
lasting frustration or anger after a session of gameplay.
    "City of Heroes" makes me happy, so I keep coming back for more.
    My secondary desires aside, it is simply a very enjoyable game.

Time to put this game in a yard sale.

    I've played the game for about a month (96 hours or 4 days total time)
and I'm tired of it.  I'm tired of the tedium, I'm tired of the boredom, and
sick of having no fun in it.  It is a game of vast scope.  And I
congratulate the work put into it.  But it just isn't enjoyable and I can't
deceive myself any longer that it will be "if I just keep playing".  I've
met some nice people and some jerks.  I'd like to travel more in the game
(why I originally chose the Wizard class) and that has brought no more
enjoyment.

    I am mature enough to realize a game is not the source of happiness
alone, but this game lacks a fun factor.  This is more like being in a
repetitious dead-end job than anything else.  I've made attempts to add
humor to the game, but it hasn't helped get past the tedious hack & slash
gameplay.

    I fault nobody if they find this game enjoyable.  Heck, I was looking
for an escape from the Quake clones and other boring shooters myself.

    I did try other classes and races, but leveling up to a decent play
level takes too long to try too many combinations.  And I've gotten sick of
the corpse hunt. So R.I.P. Amatrix L9 Wizard on Erollisi Marr.
