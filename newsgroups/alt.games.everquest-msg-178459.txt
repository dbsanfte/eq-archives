Well, the best soloer is the Necro.  Druids and Wizards are very solid,
however.

The fact is, you can viably solo any class other than a warrior and a rogue
(and even then, with the right gear).  As gimped as Paladins are throughout
most of the game, I did levels 33-51 almost exclusively solo (maybe a full
level's worth of grouping over that entire range), and she's my main so
there's no twinking involved, other than the Tizmak Tunic and Leggings she
wore until Luclin came out and destroyed her lovely outfit ;_;

I use my bard for soloing when I want to feel relevent, and she's amazing.
I still haven't tried swarm kiting, but I'm looking forward to it.  Though,
my baby barbie beastie is alot of fun.  Honestly, I'd recommend a Barbie or
Kittie beastlord for soloing.  They're easier to play than a bard, no
faction issues with good races, can melee and not get slaughtered like an
int caster, and aren't a druid.  About the only thing they're missing is
Gate.
