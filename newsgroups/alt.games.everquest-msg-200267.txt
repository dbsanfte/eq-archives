You should do fine at that lvl on the first floor. There's a nice long
corridor at zone in so you don't need snare, although with the recent
pathing changes you might need to root occasionally. One thing you
will need are invis potions to get in and out. There tend to be too
many mobs around to fight your way in and the paladin won't have the
option to gate out when you're done. Fun zone though, usually empty
and nice exp.
