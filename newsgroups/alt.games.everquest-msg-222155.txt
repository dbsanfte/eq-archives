Well - I dual box with my 65 mage, so let me throw my 2cents in :)

First off, I have two computers but they share keyboard/monitor/mouse
through a KVM.  Still not quite as limiting as 2 instances on one machine,
but not as easy to run two people as 2 seperate setups.

To alleviate some of the disadvantages of this - I have programmable 
keypads attached to each comp, so I can cast spells, hit hotkeys and
do a couple other things without switching to the other comp.  Second,
I use EQ Watcher to give me audible alerts to events on the computers,
from tells to pet buffs wearing off to resists and fizzles.

Obviously, in a 1 box setup the seperate keypads wouldn't benefit you,
but you could use EQ Watcher to watch one of the characters log files
for important events.

On to classes.  The first character I 'botted was a cleric - easy to PL
because he can heal himself, take hits, root runners so his DS can finish
them.  Since he has nukes you can switch to the "Pet takes mob to a couple
percent, then reclaim pet - cleric nukes to finish" approach.  BTW - this
is far more effective than having the cleric atone IME.  At 39 I had the
cleric buffing my 57 earth pet and CH'ing him.  I was able to obliterate
shissar in The Gray - they hit fast, and you can chain pull them onto the
pet, since they go for what's hitting their buddy over the puller who hit
them for 5 pts of damage.

Enchanter - a bit harder to PL, since you have to give up the DS and tank
route far sooner.  Benefits - well, extra mana regen and slows/cripple make
killing fast and easy.  If you're fsat enough at switching characters and
a decent enchanter already you get some CC as well.

Beastlord - I love this combo.  A bit of extra mana regen that stacks with
KEI and XPG, light heals to take care of the damage I take occasionally
while pulling, slows, buffs, looking forward to attack buffs and the like,
a little CC - It's pretty easy to get an add on the BL pet, and dps from
the added pet. 

I find that, when duoing with the beastlord he is a pet cleric/nuker and
I primarily play the mage and 'bot the BL.  In a group, however, I 'bot
the mage and play the BL as an in your face melee.  Something I haven't
gotten to do since my bard on Povar :)

The cleric is 65 with 100+ aa now (and some nice gear for our level).  The
Enchanter is 53 and the Beastlord just dinged 53 yesterday. 

I realize you might already get a BL in your groups from Tea and Lenny's
2box.  But the hands off nature of pet classes also recommends a necro as
a good 2nd box.
