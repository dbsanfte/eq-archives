Nice, but I do wish their entire body were encased in flame...and the
boundery where the body ends were more of a fade out than an end.
Still one of the better ones they gave.

I think the fire elemtal should turn into a rotating sphere of fire when the
player is sitting.

Great, about the same as fire.  I like it and again just wish they could
make the body fade to non existence, maybe have a little steam/smoke/air
vapors rising from the upper part of the body (just barely, like about the
thickness of a staff or club).

I think a cooler/better looking design for when the player is sitting would
be to turn into a miniature cloud of wind that moves/spirals/rotates around
similar to that of a tornado, hurricane, small whirl wind.

I REALLY think this one could have been different.  My ONE more disliking of
the 4 elementals (others could have had more work, not sure how this version
of DX would support it though).  My idea would be for the entire body to be
more like a wattery mass, bubble like object.
    Does anybody remember the Nintendo64 game "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina
of Time"?  If you have played and remember that blob like thing that adult
Link fights at the end of the Water Temple (the thing that comes out of that
pool of water and looks like some kind of worm made out of water), this is
the type of texture I think the water elementals have, and I know Luclin is
far superior to the graphics/hardware capabilities of the Nintendo64 and a
1998 release game (that didn't even use the N64 memory upgrade at the time).
The body should be more transparent, or at least the base of it should be.

For sitting possition I think they should have them liquify down into a
perfectly round sphere of water, hoovering slightly above the ground.
Another idea would be to liquify down into a puddle of water maybe with a
little fountain effect bubbling out of the center of it (just to help show
there is something other than a pool of water there).

I personally think the water elementals look too closely (the part holding
the body anyway) like the sparkle effect you get when casting some spells.

Another good one.  Really not much to be said here, great work/idea.

As for a sitting position, I think something similar in the way a "rock
dervish" (of Lavastorm Mountains) looks would be nice. (spinning and
rotating clumps of dirt).
