As a berserker, I use two different types of throwing axe a great deal, 
on the order of 5 of each per kill.

This means I have to keep an eye on consumption, and I'm playing around 
a bit with better ways to do that.

My high ratio axes are used for throwing, honestly I could stop using 
them for most fights and never notice a difference, but I'm trying to 
get the skill up, and find that I can get in five throws per pull on 
average, skill is slowly going up.  I also do an average of 5% damage to 
a mob while using them for target practice on incoming like this, so its 
not a total waste of time... and I've found that I can do enough damage 
to mobs that are chasing me around that my regen rate outpaces theirs, 
so if I get in real trouble I can kite till I've got the advantage 
again, then close and finish them off.

My special berserk abilities require a different axe, one that has a 
much worse ratio and a longer delay (which would mean even if I only 
wanted the skill ups I still would want the better axe so as to get more 
shots off on incoming).  Both snare and stun axes make a large 
difference in each fight, so having these axes on hand is very important.

I've tried putting the two types of axes in my range and ammo slots, and 
discovered that putting the ability component axe in range, I still use 
the high ratio axe out of my ammo slot first when hitting the range 
button.

Further, I don't use the range slot axes until my inventory is otherwise 
empty of them.

Trouble is, when I run out of high ratio axes in my ammo slot, I start 
using my ability component axes for range attacks.

I've gone back to putting high ratio axes back into both ammo and 
ranged, and started putting a stack of Ability axes into the upper left 
slot in my inventory, not in a bag.

Now I find that I use both the ammo and ranged slot axes (getting both 
stacks low before either is emptied), but I don't use the number one 
slot ability axes until all my other ability axes are gone.  In the end, 
thats probably for the best, I can drag that inventory slot over to my 
hotkeys bar and have a visual confirmation that I have more than 20, or 
am down to my last few and have a count of that.

What confuses me is that I'd have though the only way to get that count 
would be to put the ability axes in the bottom right corner, not the 
upper left one
