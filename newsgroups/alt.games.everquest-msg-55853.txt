Well, I own now several chars, one a Shaman up to 50 and now started a
Shadowknight ('SK') and he's 22 now. I can solo him easily still at 22,
but that's due to him being a hard twink, which means he has lots of
expensive and rare items, which allow the soloing. I doubt it is possible
without such gear, unless you try fear kiting, which SK's can do (you can
slow the enemy's walking speed with darkness spells and then cast fear on
him to make him run away slowly and hit him in the back). However, that is
pretty mana intensive on an SK, which don't have too much intelligence
(basis for your mana pool) and you will have lots of downtime, apart from
the fact that fear is a pretty slow casting spell and you will get hit
and thus interrupted in casting often if you wear newbie gear. That
will be your start, as you will be very far off able to afford the gear
my SK currently has.

As for hard to play, it is not. It is, like others said, a basic melee class,
the second best tank in game if it comes to HP and AC (sharing that with the
paladin), and (in my opinion) the best tank any experience group up
to 60 can have, since we nearly match warriors in HP and AC, we do 3/4th
of a warrios damage (well, tanks are not about damage, we're about taking
damage anyway .. leave dealing damage to monks and rogues etc), and we
are FAR better taunters than warriors, because some of our spells cause
the mob to really hate us. Every caster in your group will eventually learn
to love Shadowknights, if you play it right. And oh yes, the others are right,
that you will be hated about everywhere. Buy enough food and your spells in
advance if you plan long trips into nowhere.

: advanced tactics like most)?  I basically want to play a fun class thats
: mostly melee with some spells and I need to be able to play solo for awhile

Then SK is the ideal class for you. You can consider a Pally, but they are
(in just my opinion) inferior to SK's in most things. They eventually get
powerful ressurection and heal spells though, but are as limited as SK's
with them because of the mana pool. The small utility spells an SK gets
are far more worth the mana, IMHO.
