I'm not interested in buying OOW yet, but I figure I will want to
eventually, and in any case I'd like to listen to the voice files
(out of game!), so I want to download the files in advance.  I got
the impression there was something I could do that would make the
patcher download a few of the files each time I start the game?
I tried looking at Advanced download options and found a checkbox
for OOW, but it seemed to be trying to download everything.

Is it still possible to do the download across several sessions,
or was that something that was available only during pre-order?
If it's still possible, how do I do it?
