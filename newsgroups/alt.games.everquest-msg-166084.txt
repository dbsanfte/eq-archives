That would not be surprising.

What surprises me are some of the strings that aren't baned.  I had a
character named "showeq" once.  That came about because I had just heard of
the bug (now fixed) where if you made a female character of certain races,
and tried to name it "verant" or "sony", after the name was rejected and you
got back to the screen that showed the character model, the camera was moved
forward some, so that her breasts were in your face, and not covered.

I wondered if that was an easter egg, or if it would happen for any rejected
name, and the first word that came to mind as something that would obviously
be banned was "showeq".

They probably should also ban names that aren't bad but that would be bad if
they had an "x" appended, so that they won't have problems with server
transfers, or restores from backup.  E.g., while there is nothing wrong with
"Boyse", they probably don't want "Boysex" running around. :-)
