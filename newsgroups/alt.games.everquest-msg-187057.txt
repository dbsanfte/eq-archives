Nevermind that LA is one of the largest cities in the US. 50 isn't
that many, even out of only half of LA. Besides, you'd need more than
one city's phone book for a valid analysis of how rare a name is.

Now, compare the 50 Zappas to how many Jones, Smiths, or, less
extreme, Mills's you'll find in the same phone book.
