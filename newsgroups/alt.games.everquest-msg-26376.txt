Sometimes, Some of us learn from observation, vs doing.  Having a friend
of mine with 1 kid at 13, and another at 16, helped open my eyes. 
Further, having a wide variety of people "preaching" to me about the
virtues of Chastity, etc.  Helped.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
