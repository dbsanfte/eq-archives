 Well I admit I was tired when I read it. Allow me to try again... Are
you saying that since there's usually limited ways to go about defeating
a mob that others shouldn't have to learn those encounters because it's
like "reinventing the wheel"? If so that's even worse and pure laziness.
If I'm still missing the boat please fill me in on what you mean.

 Listen, EQ is not rocket science. How to beat any encounter: You take
the mobs abilities, add in any environmental variables, add in the
abilities brought to the encounter by your raid and if you can't figure
out how to kill something on your own you're not trying very hard. To
say that everyone relies on leet beta infoz, sharing of strategies or
copying everyone else is plain stupid.
