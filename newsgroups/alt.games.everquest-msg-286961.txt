Saw this, so I figured I'd bring it up here.  Looking at the forums,
there's quite a bit of masochism going on, but I figure there are some
here who'd like to see this happen.

They're working on an emulated EQ server that will be "EQ Classic",
just original, Kunark and Velious.  None of the new stuff.  No hot
zones, no kitties.  The return on hell levels and staring at the
spellbook (/cry).

Interesting concept.  It's also interesting to see how strongly
nostalgic some folks are.  Obviously, it's my own assumption, but the
phrase "You can't go home again" keeps popping in my head.
