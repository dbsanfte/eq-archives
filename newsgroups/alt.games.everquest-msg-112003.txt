Lol :)

Well it was somewhat funny...  I'd first met him in Velks, when over a
spider dispute (i love that zone!) he kindly informed me how much he and his
guild hated me..

Anyway after he took a DT in PoF, the abuse tells suddenly changed to..
"will you drag me please!".. heh I must of got a /tell from everybody in his
guild who wereonline... "hi.. i was wondering if you can do me a big favour
please?" .... "a guildie is stuck and really needs a drag"....  "his name
is...."

A chanter friend of mine, who'd came to help on the C.R (and really is one
of the nicest guys on my server) was sooo enraged by what the monk did, he
begged me to drag the body some place evil, lol :)

Anyway a month or so ago, I get a random tell from him... "hey man.. would
you sponsor me to join PDF?"  I enquire what happened to his hatred of my
guild.. and all the other bs he was spouting in ooc/shout/tells at the
time.. he gives some crap about fcfs/velk, he was just a noob back then
(like 2months prior...), he was mature now and wanted to make up.. heh.

I politely told him to go forth and multiply... or words to that effect.
