Why yes annie did help me place lenny (ogers) points but as far a lenny (troll) goes he
has maxed weapon skills in all but hand to hand.  My troll is master both makeing and
useing arrows and can hit with any weaopon allowed

I made a war with maxed Stam for hps never made it past lvl 9 my dwarf max str. after a
troll never again.
