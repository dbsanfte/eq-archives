Or anyone else in beta

When I logged on earlier, I noticed the trader on the Refugee Isle had
some new tools for harversting - pick, fiching rod, etc.  I could
still harvest without them, so wondered what difference they made -
speed/quality/quantity ?

I didn't ahve the spare cash to buy one, so would be grateful if you
could clear up the mystery.

Also, after killing a bunch of Goblins, I was told my character had
received some sort of Goblin killing promotion - is this new ?  And
what's the point ?  Just for fun, or does it build up to some sort of
bonus ?

Thanks.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
