My Paladin has only died once in his last four LDs during combat.
All occurred in LGuk.  The three I survived included two where I
was in the middle of getting multiple mobs rooted so I could run
for the zone.  The one I died I was also trying to set up an
escape but it was pretty hopeless so the only thing that surprised
me was that I was beginning to expect LD to make me invincible. :)
If it wasn't such a small sample I'd complain about it happening
in bad crcumstances most of the time.

Kaev <--- who is a Paladin, <not> a pally   :-p
