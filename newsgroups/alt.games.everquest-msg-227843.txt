I have turned it off in the options but that stupid popup keeps on
happening! No I don't want to report to SOE. No. No means no! Aaaargh. I
sometimes wonder if it's the popup that causes the issue. Certainly the fact
that they say it doesn't contain information like a traceroute makes me
wonder what the point is.. surely diagnostic info and a list of other
programs and a snapshot of the free memory etc would be required to debug
the problem e.g. EQ crashes if you have a certain firewall, so warn people
about it, or you could be informed that you are crashing because of
insufficient ram at that point in time...

although i tend to crash in the bazaar and i suspect that would be a server
side issue; I stay connected in JP for long periods.
