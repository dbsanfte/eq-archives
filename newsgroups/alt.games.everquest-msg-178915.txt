WOW! Sounds a bit harsh to me.  I can't imagine all the stuff that I take
for granted in the game that would be missing, and not just the most recent
stuff like the Bazaar and POP porting capabilities. Just think, NO epics, NO
post 50 spells, NO Iksars, NO Vah Shirs, NO Skyshrine or Kael Armor, NO AA
points and no Beastlords. What about all the gear that would no longer be
available and where would everyone go once a large number of people hit 50th
level? Might get some takers, but it wouldn't be me.
