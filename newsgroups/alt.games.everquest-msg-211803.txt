If your STA stat is 100 or higher the only effect that running your
yellow stamina bar down has is that you cannot jump.  This has been
tested and documented by many players (including myself) over the
last 2-3 years.  So, unless your gear leaves you encumbered (or
nearly encumbered) due to low STR, or you are a Monk and lose a lot
of AC when your weight passes an arbitrary threshold (14 I believe,
I think it goes up after L50), the weight of weapons does not mean
a whole lot.

This is normal behavior, for those classes that can dual wield.  One
of the requirements of tanking, the very first one in fact, is the
ability to hold agro.  If you can't keep the mob swinging at you then
it does not matter how much AC/HP you have.

You get to be a first class damage dealer, they get to tank.  LH and
HT aren't worth half what Ranger Tracking is worth, hell they aren't
worth one tenth of it.  They are minor aspects of the knight classes,
their strength is in using their spells to magnify their tanking and
pulling abilities.  A Ranger's strengths, long term, are outdoor
pulling, doing damage without getting hurt (this is #1), finding
specific mobs (also knowing when they're up), and situational tanking.
(Foxeye seems determined to arrange to tank in the majority of the
situations she finds herself in, most Rangers treat tanking like
cleaning the bathroom: dont do it unless there's nobody else.)

You can make far far more cash via intelligent use of Ranger Tracking
than a boatload of SKs could make fearkiting mobs that drop FS in ten
times the playtime.

You're seeing only a tiny fraction of the functionality of those
classes, and only at extremely low level.  At level 30 you are
only just starting to play the game.  Seriously.  For nearly all
players in EQ the time spent playing a character below level 30
is only a tiny fraction of the time spent playing the game.

A few months from now you will see the classes in a whole different
light, if you keep playing.  If not, well, your continued ignorance
could be used as fuel for many more rants, if that's what floats
your boat.
