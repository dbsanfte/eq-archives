Well, that depends on your personal religious and moral Basis,  I have a
friend who felt that It would be innappropriate to indulge in such
displays of affection until he was married.  He is now happily married
and has been for quite a while.  He married at 31, as a virgin.

learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
