i was doing 'tents' yesterday, and after pulling the dogs in the main room,
and the first 2 gargs, I was umm.. very surprised that the next 4 gargs were
not up.

They are in between the first 2 gargs, and the 2 big sentinels, so I don't
see how anybody had killed just those 4

Last time i was in tents, the mobs were popping, then "falling through" the
ground, gm said they were running off the map, and re-popped the zone

shrug.. pos coding?
