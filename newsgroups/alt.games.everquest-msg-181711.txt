Mm? I'm a gamer, I've played original D&D, and I don't hold that
stereotype about bards. The fact someone mentions the stereotype is
because of a picture in the original D&D book leads me to beleive that
it's held by people who don't get out enough, since no one I've ever
gamed with holds such a stereotype.
