Yes, *sigh*
There are two other conjuration spells available at my level. One, of
course, is Eye of Zomm, and the other is Halo of Light. The problem with
both of these is that they can't be chain cast. The Eye has to be
dispelled, killed, etc. before you can cast again, and the whole process
takes a long time to cast once. The Halo is, I believe, Lore and it
won't let you cast it again until you destroy the one you currently
have.

Yes, I know damn well that this is just laziness on my part, but all my
other spell types can be practiced with some hot keys that I use. They
just have the correct delays built in, and cast a level 1 or 4 spell
each cycles until I run out of mana or max out those skills. There is no
conjuration spell for wizards that you can do this with, AFAIK. So I can
log in some saturday and spend my WHOLE fucking day in the bazarre
casting a stupid light hat and destroying it, over and over and over and
over again just to get the ability up that I have to have for my
familiar.

Nice going, Verant. Oh, and even after you *do* get conjuration up to a
respectable level (I finally flushed enough points and practice casts in
to get it over 100) this spell STILL fizzles a ton more than any other
in that line. This whole conjuration/familiar debacle is one of the
sickest things VI has put in the game in a while.
