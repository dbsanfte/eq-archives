Here's a copy/paste of a power brewing guide I posted not too long ago.  It
will get brewing mastered in no time and faitly cheaply.

<---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------->
Ah, brewing was one of the more fun skills I mastered.  When you start out,
Freeport is a great location. The brew merchant is right next to the NFP
zone in WFP, and it's a short jaunt to the barrel outside the Hogcaller's
inn.  Now if you, like me, are a non-forager, then you have a more limited
option in skilling up, so I'll post my guide for non-foragers.

When you start, kill many snakes, or just grab snake scales from the
merchants in the FP newbie zone.  This will be for your first ware, Bog
Juice.

in a Brew Barrel combine:
1 water, 1 snake scale, 1 bottle
Yield 1 bog juice
Trivial 21

Now you can move up to Ale.  Purchase barley and malt from the brew
merchant.
in a Brew Barrel combine:
1 barley, 1 malt, 1 water, 1 cask
Yield 3 Ales
Trivial 68

Now you have 2 options.  If you feel like killing some rats for ears, and
spiders for legs, do so, and when you've filled up a backpack of each, buy
some rice form the brew merchant and head back to the barrel.
in a Brew Barrel combine:
1 rice, 1 spider legs, 1 rat ears, 1 bottle
Yield 2 Gnomish Spirits
Trivial 102

My preference was to skip this step and move on to Ol' Tuljim's Fierce Brew.
Grab some barley, hops, yeast, and  malt from the brew merchant.
in a Brew Barrel combine:
1 barley, 1 hops, 1 yeast, 1 malt, 1 cask
Yield 2 Ol' Tuljim's Fierce Brew
Trivial 135 (if you skipped the previous step like I did, you will see many
many failures at this stage but don't lose hope.  This will also earn you
friendship with Rogues who need the brew for their Burning Rapier quest.)

Very few go past Ol' Tujim's, but I'm nuts, so I went to 200 with my skill.
It's time for you to pack up and leave Freeport, and run to Highpass.
You're looking for the Lion's Roar, or soemthing like that, tavern.  You'll
know it if you see an NPC named something The Just.  She's near the Brew
Barrel.  There is also a bar tender who will have casks and mead to sell
you.  Behind this merchant is a stairway which leads to the top floor, where
you'll see a (secret?) merchant who sells drinks you could only normally get
in  their respective towns, elven wine, gnomish spirits, dwarven ale.  Buy a
few stacks of these three.

in a Brew Barrel combine:
1 elven wine, 1 gnomish spirits, 1 dwarven ale, 1 mead, 1 cask
Yield 1 Faydwer Shaker and 4 empty bottles (hold onto the bottles, if you're
like me and make heady kiolas for tailoring)
Trivial 188

By now, you have arthritis, or your hands are numb, but we're not done yet.
Head back to freeport and lets play with the Minotaur Hero's Brew

in a Brew Barrel combine:
3 malt, 1 yeast, 2 flask water, 2 short beer, 1 cask
Yield 1 Minotaur Hero's Brew and 2 empty bottles
Not trivial at 200

I hope that helps. Bottoms up!
