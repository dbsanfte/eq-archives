Yes, Focus level II effects work on spells from level 1 to 44, which includes
your level 5 spell, whatever it may be.

There is a quasi exception to this; spell haste items.  Curiously, spell haste
I works on spells with a duration of 1.0 or higher, while spell haste II works
on spells with a duration of 2.0 or higher, so there will be some low level
spells with a duration of at least 1.0 but less than 2.0 which aren't affected
by the spell haste II item but would be if you also had a spell haste I item.

Another exception is that certain items affect only some types of spells, for
example Haste of Mithaniel hastes only heals and buffs, not detrimental
spells, so you may not want to replace a Spell Haste IV item with the Haste of
Mithaniel item; they do coexist, so that your buffs and heals will cast faster
with the HOM item on, and items that don't get that speed boost will at least
get the lesser bonus of the SHIV item.

As a general rule of thumb, though, if you have a better focus item you can
discard the lesser item who's effect it duplicates, since the effects merely
coexist, they don't actually stack.
