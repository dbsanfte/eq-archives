I'm running an AMD XP3200 with an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro.  Runs great, never 
overheats.  I did go a bit overboard on cooling though just to be safe.  
I have two case fans (3 if you count the power supply), and I bought an 
overkill CPU cooling system instead of using the stock one that comes 
with the AMD processor.  The ATI cooling seems to be adequate with the 
stock setup with one of the case fans blowing air right over the card.  I 
always keep the system monitor running to warn me if I ever do have a 
problem with temperature or a fan too.
