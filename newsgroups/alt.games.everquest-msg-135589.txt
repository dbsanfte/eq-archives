    First problem. You NEED four offtanks to get aggro on those things fast.
What chews casters up is when untanked mobs see a cleric CH, so they warp
over to him and kill him, then they're in the middle of the casters and
ping-ponging around while tanks try to find what's killing everyone. At
least if they're glued to a tank people can spam heals on that tank, trying
to keep him alive, and other tanks can be right there building aggro for
when the first tank bites it.

    If you're really worried have the main tanks use Evasive on them.
Refreshes faster than Defensive, actually prevents more damage against mobs
with low damage intervals (see Steel Warrior for the whole math breakdown).
By the time you've cleared the last Rhags and set up your aggro correctly
for AL, they should have cycled.

    Only if you were the only person on the hate list. I generally find that
tanks can build more aggro than the aggro from one CH in the 18 seconds a DA
buys me. If you are the only person on the list (how that happens in a room
filled with KOS people baffles me, but it does happen) then a /say "Untanked
mob here" followed by a /y will get it off you.

    Heh - did he use AoE taunt? Even our 7500 HP warrior gets wiped when he
forgets and uses that instead of regular taunt. The only other way he'd get
all four would be if he got low health aggro early on.

    Oddly enough, it's the damn guards/offtank mobs/etc. that give the most
trouble to people. Yesterday we killed Arch Lich and High Priest - both were
zero-death kills. BUT... pulling the High Priest's guards to set up
offtanking, we lost people, and when trying to leave the HP room to go back
to the offtanking room afterwards we lost people. /chuckle
