I don't know to what extent groups are safer than soloing... The few
times I've grouped my druid, we've been close to wipeout on more than
one occasion. Bear in mind that being in a big group tempts you into
tackling stuff you wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole when on your own.
Exciting, challenging and very social, but I'd see that on average, more
dangerous too.

Of course, this is only applies to the natural soloing classes, Druid,
Necro and Mage. For the rest, there is indeed safety in numbers.
