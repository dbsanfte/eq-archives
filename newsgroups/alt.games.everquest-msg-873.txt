I was the primary healer in an orc highway group with my shaman a
while back.  Seeing as how I was <19th, there was no way to keep
up with the serious hurt an overpull, especially one with an 'A' orc
warrior in it, could lay on our warrior.  Situations like these you have
to use your mana a bit differently - Slow the 'A', TB each 'an' back
up and root park it, repeat until all non casters are out of the fight.
Overall that did a lot more to keep our warrior alive than all the
lesser heals I could muster.  Most of the day I did have a pally
or a druid as backup fortunately.  The only thing marring that was
a stupid rogue who, every time we had an opening pestered me
with "get a cleric, we need a cleric."  Well, there weren't any
available, so I just filled the slot with the next person.  Finally, the
warrior got so fed up with it he told the rogue to shut up, that I'd
kept us alive through trains and overpulls all day.  That made
my day.
