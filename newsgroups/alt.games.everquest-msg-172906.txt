Fix coldain faction without becoming KOS to giants?  Fix Giant  factions
without becoming KOS to coldains?

I suppose its possible, but I have no idea how to do either of these little
chores.

Then again, I haven't spent any time thinking about it really, other than
"hey, look, I'm dubious on both ends, cool!"
 and "hmm, wonder if I can bypass faction work here with charm"

Having done faction work in Kael in order to get non KOS with my cleric, and
to repair damaged COV faction, I'm aware that it certainly takes longer than
ten minutes, which is about the net time the subject has spent on my "things
to think about" shelf.

I'm thinking about it even now as an intellectual curiousity, without actually
having any MQ pieces available to even make the question truely interesting.

Is it possible to raise both coldain and giant factions?  I'm completely
willing to hose COV faction to do so.  Killed in SS quite a bit now with nary
a move in my "dubious" status to either frost or storm giants... been dubious
forever it seems.
