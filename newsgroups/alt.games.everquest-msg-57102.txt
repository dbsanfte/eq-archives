XP working fine here, with one slight problem...

Sometimes when I log on to Character Selection, I don't
have a mouse cursor.  I can't push any buttons, so I
have to CTRL-ALT-DEL ("windows" key disabled
in the registry ;-)  ) out, quit game, restart the game
(OS does fine), and that fixes it.

Not really much to complain about at all...sound
and graphics are great!
