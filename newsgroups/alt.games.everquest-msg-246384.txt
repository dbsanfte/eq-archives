I presume on raids? In most of the groups I've been in, sitting has been
safe or unavoidable (eg dungeons, so no steeds allowed) but i've heard in
some zones mobs will aggro on anyone sitting, so a clicky heal like that is
not to be scoffed at.

I remember seeing a troll warrior soloing freeport guards many years ago,
sitting at a zone line. I have never fought them and assume it's just the
ones near the gate that are undercons. Anyway, I'm sure he would have
appreciated this change.

It has made my monk marginally more effective but I can see situations and
classes where it would be powerful, especially if the max rgen rate is
highest for the high level warriors.

For those classes/levels without complete heal, it's a great boon to be able
to get the tank to sit and bind while you med, heal them 70 ->100 %, and
then have more mana for nuking!
