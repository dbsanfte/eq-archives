I've tried doing searches on the various items lists but I keep thinking
that something is being left out.  Is there a decent/popular regen item for
melee types in their 20's or 30's?  Thanks.

Come to think of it, what are the popular choices for mana regen amongst the
low-end casters?  Thanks again.

Clayton
