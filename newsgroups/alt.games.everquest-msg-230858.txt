Which will prove what?   He's saying the increase in proc rate from higher
dexterity is minimal.   Which pretty much matches my experience.

What you're doing is akin to saying 'Increasing agility by 60 points
increases your armor class by 3 points!.    Ask any warrior if armor class
is important to what they do.  Therefore you should increase agility at the
expense of stamina.'

Seems to.   Uh uh.

And as we all know, skill ups need no real help.

Useful, sure.   More useful than hit points or stamina, not even close.
