Wow, I didn't catch that other guys total ignorance.

If there can be said there is any beauty to the HIV virus, is that it
mutates VERY efficiently (ironically, proof of evolution), and a "cocktail
mixture" of which there about 12 different kinds, will only stave off the
virus for so long, before it mutates again, becomes resistant, and then they
have to take another one of the mixtures.
