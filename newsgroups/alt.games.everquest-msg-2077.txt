I had that experience at the Chessboard over the weekend. I was wanting to
solo undead pawns with my level 10 mage (and do household chores while I
medded). The night before I had shared the camp with a level 20-ish Paladin
and it worked out pretty well. I get there and there is a level 14 druid
/shouting that the chessboard was camped. I sent her a tell asking her to
let me know when she was done. She sent a really snotty reply back that it
had been hers for 2 hours, she was going to be there a long time, tough
luck, etc. She also said "Watch out, you're standing right where I'm gonna
kite this pawn." So, I moved out of the way and watched this level 14 take a
real long time to kill something I could have easily handled with my 10 mage
and earth pet (blue to me).

After seeing how long it took her to kill one, and how long she had to med
afterwards, I asked her to share. She was *really* rude at first saying she
wouldn't share with anyone. I thought to myself, well if I decide to
petition, there's a quote that the GM might like to see. By that time 3
undead pawns had popped, and she was still medding. I figgered there was NO
way she'd keep up with the spawn so I sent another /tell saying that she was
supposed to share if asked, and that I could petition if necessary. There
was a long pause (I think she was checking with a higher level that was
camping that dwarf near there). She came back and said that I could have the
back of the board. Now, was that SO hard? :-)  Then she offered to heal me
if I got in trouble. (???) The two of us couldn't even keep up with the
spawn.

But, here's where it got kinda silly.. I noticed that I was barely getting
1/2 blue bubble per pawn (even outdamaging my pet). After killing two I
realized that this was not the place for me to get to 11 at. So I said good
bye to the "nice" druid and headed to CB.  How much exp could she be getting
at 14? Didn't make much sense to me.. did tell me one thing though.. kiting
is just not something I'm interested in doing. I think I'm more of a nuker!
