I am the one you just quoted and I have something to say in MY defense.
This writer and I spoke for 1/2 hour to 45 mins.  Most of our discussion was
very neutral and positive.  My EXACT quotes that he combined were:

"If you have a bad day in RL, you can always go 'in' and most times is a
totally different situation.  People are there to group and help each other,
most of the time."

"If someone lacks the social skills to be successful in RL situations, they
could POSSIBLY be more successful in EQ due to the fact of  non face-to-face
encounter."

"You can spend $9.99 a month , stay home, play EQ, talk to hundreds of
people
or you can go to a bar and  pay $20.00-$50.00 per night and talk to 10
people."

I got misquoted or he chose to paraphrase my thoughts incorrectly

Calm Down Jazz

PS  There is no such thing as "normal."   Normal means a different thing to
each person.  It's SUBJECTIVE.    So you ARE normal.....if you believe you
are.......in whichever situation you are in.
