Just an FYI for everyone. SI Entertainment is currently offering free web
space for fans to make a Everquest web site or any collectible, comics,
game, or movie site. You get 3GB data transfer per month and 15MB disk
space. We are not doing this to make money that is why it is free. We are
simply doing this to get more users to our site. If you are interested or
just want to check us out go to http://www.southernisland.com. Note our site
is currently not Netscape friendly. We are working on this but use Explorer
or compatible until it is fixed.
