I've said it before and I'll say it again, Druid/Necro is a way
fucking powerful duo.

Necros bring INSANE amounts of damage.

Druids bring a nice LONG fixed duration snare, DoTs that stack with
Necros and Regen/Chloro.  And Regen/Chloro plus the Necro canabalize
spell means that the Necro will never, EVER run out of mana.
