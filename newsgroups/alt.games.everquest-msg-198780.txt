Hmmm some would say SZ is not good Pvp, RZ (no teams anyone within
range can attack anyone else) is the only true way to PvP, how much
challenge is it for a lvl 65 to grief a lvl 10 after all? Makes SZ a
bad choice to get started on. OTOH RZ means never having a dropable
item of value in most slots. Have died so fast was unable to bag
anything much less that Crusty breastplate lol (Dam SKs and wizzies).
Makes being a melee kinda tough, casters (as usual) have it easier.

For that matter all the zeks are a mess due to SoEs attitude on PvP.
Cant really recommend any of them but do enjoy it once in a while.

Having thought it out a bit for the OP ,  on the 3 classes perhaps
melee isnt the way to go at all. Maybe 2 necros and a druid, would be
tough to beat that bunch post lvl 29 (boil blood, nice pets, good
nukes, good healing, shadowstep, sow, evac, snare, root, tracking,
equipment needs are slim, animal and undead charm, and all could be
human or shorty on TZ or SZ).

Think I will sell that new Rigid Armor on my bard and go back to my
inky necro lol. My carpal tunnel thinks so.
