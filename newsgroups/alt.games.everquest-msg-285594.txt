Bah.  Almost all the stuff about old EQ is what I liked best.  If I
wanted to play solo I'd play Dungeon Siege or Empire III or whatever.
The best part of an MMORPG is the damned MM.  Otherwise what's the
point?

Everything I've heard about WoW (no I've not played it, only seen it
and talked with others who have) it appeals to the dirty masses.
People who think MUD is water and dirt, people who have never even
heard of Merdian59 (isn't that that new rock group from Russia?), the
little kids with no patience or sense of accomplishment (1 to 60 in 3
weeks?  gimme a break).
All I've heard about WoW leads me to believe it blows goats.  But hey,
some people like goats.

Give me boats, even if I do zone and the boat is a mile ahead of me
and I drop in the water.  Give me CR's, even if I have to pay a necro
to summon my corpse or wait for it to be non-rezable in the graveyard.
Give me trains in Black Burrow, the East Commons bazaar,  faction that
matters, no PoK, classes that have unique skills and abilities (what
story *anywhere* leads people to believe shaman's can summon you to
your corpse?!), give me people who are not afraid to try something
that may get them wiped even if it costs 3 hours of play time.
