Did you try fear kiting them?  I think the frogs are animals...

I soloed undead in POV with my cleric, figure if a cleric can solo something
surely a ranger with a slower handy can do the same?

Other than that, I don't really know.  But I do have a question.

How can you duo and have the LFG flag up at the same time?  I solo and LFG at
the same time a lot, of course, but add a buddy and suddenly instead of LFG to
anyone doing a who all, I'm at best advertising our LFG status to just the
zone I'm in via /ooc...
