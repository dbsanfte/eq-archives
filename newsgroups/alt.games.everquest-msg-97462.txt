To a point, I disagree. As I mentioned to Ben, I think the spellbook
does make the life of a caster harder. *Particularly* in dungeon
grouping situations. Removing it early on makes it easier, and IMO only,
dumbs the game down to a certain degree. "How Much" harder, is open for
debate, obviously. Soloists who med in safe spots have chimed in here
and said they have died "maybe five times in thirtyfour levels" because
of the book, so obvioulsy it's a smaller impact. But still, five CR's
and the possibility of five doses of lost xp (if it was after level
five) did make the game harder.

I'll fully agree with that. But fact is, it *WAS* in the game. For three
years. So it became part of the game. I hated it too (and still do) but
I deal with it and look forward to the reward I'll get at 35 when I
finally "outgrow" it. Or did, anyway. Since it's going away tomorrow,
the whole point is nothing more than an interesting debate of opinions
on the merits at this stage of the game.

Please go back and show me where I ever said that people who "hate the
spellbook" are in the minority. I think very nearly EVERYONE hates it.
I'll even go so far as to say that people who still think it should be
left in the game for the reasons I stated are in the *minortity*. But
that doesn't mean it's not a valid opinion to have.
