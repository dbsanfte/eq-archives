I can add that in GFay at least, the Mystic Voice are just south of the 
Scion. Cant be targetted normally, but if you give it something (found 
out by accident, wanted to drop some foraged stuff on the ground), you 
have it in the target box afterwards.
Spend a little time trying to meelee it (hehe, druid with 141 1hs), 
couldnt hit, but stopped after it appearantly riposted, and hit me for 
134 dmg.
