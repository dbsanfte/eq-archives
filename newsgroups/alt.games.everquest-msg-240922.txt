If you mostly single group and dont raid (as you say you dont), I would go
Divine Arb 3 / Celestial Regen 3.  These are very useful AA for single
groups.

The healing AA are nice, but it is rare (at the level I am currentley
playing at anyway) that a crit will actually heal for its stated amount, is
nice to crit on spam heals though.

MGB I would leave till after, although I understand your reasons for getting
it, it would be no more than a toy for you until you get into a raiding
guild (if that is what you want in the future etc).

I do not play a cleric myself (well, a 33 cleric, but that hardly counts),
so any other 'real' clerics feel free to correct me :)

In the end get them all, choose a few AA that you know will improve your
character, and go for them, then go for the next, I like to max AA ranks
before going onto the next.

For example I did Combat Agility 3 followed up by Lightning Reflexes 5 for
max avoidance (plus physical enhancement).

The lower ranks in multi-tiered AA's are generally crap, SCF1, ND1 etc
provide only small boosts, but the third level in these make a fairly
significant difference.
