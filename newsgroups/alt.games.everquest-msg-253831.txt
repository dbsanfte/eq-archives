I'm not saying it can't affect gameplay, I'm saying it's not something
to highlight because unless it breaks, (almost) noone cares about
backend changes until they start doing something with it.

Patch messages are usually about what actually changes about gameplay,
not any change that could cause bugs (which is pretty much all changes
of any kind).

This is not to say I don't think it's a good thing to mention they're
changing the AA back end code, just that it's not something that
necessarily has to be included in the "highlights" of a patch.

Well, in theory, this is what they have testing for, and this time it
sounds like they're actually testing.  And an important difference
between this change and the DX9 change is that it's a lot easier to
test (since it runs on the server) and is not expected to break
anything (which the DX9 patch was, for those without DX9 drivers).
