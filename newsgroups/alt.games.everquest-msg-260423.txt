They aren't Dire Charm pets. DC pets don't quad-400 :>. Command of
Druzzil is the straight level 65 enchanter charm that was used. And...
where is your snarer in that core? With a full-on charm pet.. High
Guardian of Justice... with mage pet items.. and VQ.. they took off
15% a round(or roughly 1.6k-2k) on the mob and would have levelled the
chanter in short order on a break without a snare. Could be done if
the chanter had twitch reflexes.. but there aint much room to run and
he'd have to be perfect. Mobs would drop in less than 10 seconds.
Hardest part was the minute and a half wait between waves :>. On an
off note.. it actually was very decent group leadership experience.
