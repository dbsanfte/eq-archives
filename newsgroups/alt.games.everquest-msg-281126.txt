Warriors can make mobs refuse to run, but they will continue to fight, and
they are not rooted (i.e. they will still move around if you move around).
This basically turns all 'runners' into undead-style stayers.  Short
duration, and reasonably short re-use.

Snaring classes, SK's, Necro's, Rangers, Druids, Wizards, Beastlords
(pet/AA), Monks (AA), Berserker

Rooting classes, Clerics, Mages (pet), Shaman, Wizards, Rangers, Druids,
Necro's, Enchanters, Paladins

So, add warriors to the list of 13 classes which can stop mobs running.

>-It appears that Wizards will be able to prevent mobs from gating.

Not just wizards if I recall, longish re-use, very short duration, so you
probably only get one shot at it per mob, or per 2 mobs.  The duration and
re-use should keep it in check.  It's already trivial to stop any mob which
gates and can be mezzed from gating anyway, so I'm not sure it's
game-breaking.
