OK so I been in KC now a few levels (50-54 now!) and have gotten to know
most of the upper parts of the zone farely well. Lmoat, Live, RCY, LCY,
Dead, Hands/WL and Basement are no strangers to my vocabulary!

So I figured out that if no one wants you in a group, then make your own,
and before you know it, you'll be moving into a camp. I spotted a L50 monk
LFG, so asked him to join up.

He responded by saying he was waiting to get into a group that was camping
the Skellie Warlord (for the Tranquil Staff). I said, that the LCY and RCY
groups would both be pulling from the area where he spawns, and that either
group would suit him fine.

He then tells me that, "No I want to just camp the courtyard, and don't want
the LCY or RCY camps". Needless to say this was boggling my mind because
since my time in KC, I have never-ever seen anyone just attempt to camp the
hall between LCY and RCY, although I suppose it could be done.

I tried to explain on three seperate occasions that RCY and LCY where both
the groups he needed to camp the Skellie Warlord, and that he should join us
(now in RCY) so we could try and get him.

He the repeated that he just wanted to camp "the courtyard" for the skellie
warlord. Hmmm....

I was being a nice guy and tried to explain to him, that camp has never
existed (least since I been slummin in KC) and he should and would be
welcome at either LCY or RCY.   The whole time he was shouting "L50 monk
wants to join CY group"...groupmates asked to get the monk, and all I could
do is explain his confusion and hear their laughs.

So after being so ignored I did what any helpful soul does and shouted
"Don't get monk cause he's an idiot!" I mean seriously, he's gonna train
whoever he gets grouped with for sure!

LOL, dumb_monk_01 then told me that I was reported and I would be in
trouble!! I laughed and said I was trying to help, but he was not listening,
and that I would gladly welcome any comments the GM had for me!

Oh well...aint KC a blast?
