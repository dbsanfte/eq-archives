I think the common thing in all the stories in this thread is there are a
bunch of EXTREMELY lazy people in the game, to some of whom the idea of a
cooperative game is one where everyone else helps you, no two way
street...

I mean if you stand in PoK and listen to someone at lvl 45 bleat for a
port to Stonebrunt for 20minutes solid there has to be something wrong
there....you have to be pretty lazy for the saving of 5 minutes from now
to be enough that you'll hang on just another 30secs in case you get that
port. And extend it from there.
