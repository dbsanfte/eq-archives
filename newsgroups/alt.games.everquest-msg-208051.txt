Yep, charm type stuff in general -mostly for enchanters.

Lull also has a charisma check. First it has a resist check, if the
mob resists the lull then it rolls against your charisma to see if it
will then attack. So it is a two step check.

They've also said that for charms, a class like enchanter is a lot
more affected by having high charisma than a class like a necromancer.
Masters of the undead are not really supposed to be charismatic.

Many druids also can't really see much difference in higher charisma,
as far as charming animals.

There is no bonus to anything for having low charisma.
