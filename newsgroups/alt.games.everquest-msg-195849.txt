Aye, I've been playing as a solo shaman, Slow, DoT, Tank quite
successfully; the "hell" part is that level 9 30 point heal which didn't
get upgraded at 14; heck at this point the mobs that I'm fighting hit for
up to 30 points in one blow!  No big deal soloing, since all I have to do
is not fight mobs that do enough damage to kill me before they die, and
heal up after (like a warrior with bandages, only I can go to full) but
sucks in a group where I'm expected to play healer, and will suck worse
as I get up to 18th.

Well its a case of know your limitations, I suppose, or more likely a
case of "doctor it hurts if I do this"

I did halflings till 9th (yay SOW), then moved to Kurns.  Hit 14 last
night, probably going back to halflings to do step two of the quest now,
when I hit 16 I'll doubtless figure out some way to MQ step three.

I'm using a Smouldering Brand as a weapon, 9/22 procs 14DD from level
one, lists for around 100pp in the bazaar since its so common on Hole
raids, although I picked mine up on one of those raids myself.  At any
rate, I find it makes an ideal twink weapon, good ratio, below the damage
cap, helpful proc, and all/all, so it moves from one twink to the next
quite smoothly.  At 9/22, its hard to replace without spending
substantially more cash.
