Yep, skipped the Hole entirely, I'm a solo/small group shaman, been there done that as far as getting raids together to do things for
me, and have no plan to do it again if it can be avoided.  Since COM is decent exp, I soloed the stables area for several levels,
collected the drops and did the paperwork run repeatedly.

95% of the shaman epic is about faction, and while its possible to do every step just once and get to the right faction level, its just
as possible to repeat earlier steps for the same result.

As a cleric I've done the Rak thing with one mage, one shaman (dead) and one cleric, all in our 50s, long before POP release.  I
suppose nowadays you'd need a rogue since they nerfed grav flux, but originally we'd have the mage go in via grav elevator and then
open the door to let the other two in.  Also, I've done it with a group, which made getting to Rak easier... but the Rak kill was again
just me and the mage's pet.

Rak is a Kunark Era mob, he's really not much of a threat other than his massive AE nuke.  Fire pets are immune to that nuke, so all
you have to do is keep the pet alive long enough to kill him.  Shaman can throw stat buff up the fire pet and throw in some heals, but
really its all CHeal and pet damage + DS.  I've seen a second mage, that helps a lot, a second cleric too... but that was before the
day of the shaman Incomplete heal, I wager with that you'd have even less to worry about.  Still, increasing DPS (second mage, higher
level mage) or increasing healing (second cleric, some kind of cleric substitute) work out all right.  I've also seen rangers chime in
with bow damage, which is ok, great even, if you can be very sure of not getting aggro.  In the end, the question is, does the mob die
before the pet dies, get there any way you like.

I prefered the times when we pulled lord Rak outside the temple so we could be add free, and amusingly enough I've seen the shaman live
thru that, by going into the water while the mage pet grabs aggro.  Indoors, there's not really anywhere to run out of AE range before
the shaman dies, and you sure don't want him running towards the kill team, if the pet fails to get aggro or the kill team gets hit by
that AE its over pretty quick.

I hear that post POP this is even more trivial, after all, the AE is only 2k hp, meaning that the mob is really tankable by standard
means by people with 8k hp and running HOTs and so forth.  Dunno, haven't done the mob in ages, all the shaman I knew already had their
epics.
