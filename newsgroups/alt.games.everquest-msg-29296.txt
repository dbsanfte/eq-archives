Your best bet at this point is probably to look for a port to West
Commonlands and head over to East commons and listen to all the auctions. I
hear tailors trying to sell the Wu's armor all the time, and the price is
coming down. You probably wont' get anywhere near a full suit with the money
you have, but you can get some of the good pieces to improve your AC.

> I have terrible armor and am fighting with my hands.

Everybody's first character has terrible armor at lvl 14, don't worry. Just
hang in there. Later on the money will come and you'll get better stuff. As
to fighting with your hands, that is the monk's bread and butter. Many will
say you need to be doing 1HB as well, and it's never a bad idea to keep all
your skills maxed, but you need your hand to hand also. My monk went 25
levels with never picking up a 1HB weapon.

> I am also looking for those lightweight fighting batons.

You may as well forget it for now. They are grossly out of your price range,
first of all. (If you found a pair for under 900 plat you'd have had a
*very* lucky day.) And second, you can't hunt for them. They drop on the 3rd
floor of Dalnir. You can't even think of stepping foot in that dungeon at
your level. Sorry, but again, be patient. That will come later.

You're doing shockingly well. I don't think I broke 100 plat before level 20
with any of my characters.

Keep your mend maxed and hang in there until you hit level 17 and get Feign
Death. This will change the whole game for you, and open up options for
soloing that will be much harder before then (should you choose to solo.)
Concentrate on getting in groups, though.  That will take you where you will
eventually need to go, and good grouping skills are vital. Someday you will
be looked for by many higher level groups for your pulling ability after you
get FD.  If you go to the Freeport area, you can nicely hunt either in W.
Commonlands or Oasis for several levels to come. And by all means get your
butt far away from Qeynos. That whole area is a waste of time after BB
starts greening out. (opinions expressed are only mine, of course, and your
mileage may vary.)
