That is an acceptable analogy but that just shows that the leadhead,
as you put it, is a very very very very VERY bad player.

As a good player (or even marginally more intelligent than eggplant
one) he will tank for you, but you aren't ENTITLED to him doing
anything.

Keep this in perspective. I am reasonable. I give everyone the buffs
they need without prompting like clarity and haste and I slow the mobs
if there's no shaman. I have a ton of mana and can afford to do a lot
of things. But don't ask me for things that are just going to annoy me
when you *don't need them*.
