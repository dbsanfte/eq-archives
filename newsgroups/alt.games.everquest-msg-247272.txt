    Aw... poor Richard!  I hate seeing you so fustrated, so I made you a
sig myself, right after I read it.  I remember a while back you said you
wanted to be in white, beat up looking armor, and to be wielding your
epic.  I forgot what else you wanted though, so I just sort of winged it.

   You might want to buy a brown horse, if you don't have one already, so
you match your sig.  The artwork is gratis, and I am sure you will agree
that it is worth it.   You can see/grab it at

Enjoy.
