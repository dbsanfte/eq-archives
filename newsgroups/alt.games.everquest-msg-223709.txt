Grummus is a straight up main tank fight witha nasty aoe that will kill
everyone. MGB Heal over times make him trivial.

Terris thule is a whack till she does something nasty , handle the nasty
then start rewhacking fight. Been awhile but i sem to recall her doing a
summon a million faeries to eat the healers at 75%, a mass dispelling of all
buffs at 50% , and something else nasty at 25% . Basic method is to kill the
adds when they add (chanter stuns usefull here ) , not be there when she
mass group debuffs , and otherwise grind her into the dirt :)
