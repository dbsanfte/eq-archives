It's been posted since Friday.

How long have you been playing? You're just NOW figuring this out? If
you play EQ, you will rely on the players for not only ninety nine point
nine percent of your information, but for the fixes to the majority of
the bugs, too.

They posted system wide messages about the changed date and the patch.
At least they did on both Innoruuk and Xev. Not sure about your server.
*shrug*.

You really don't read this group much, so you? Just joined us to bitch
because you couldn't log in?

Good point. Maybe I've just joined the ranks of all the regular readers
of this forum who get sick and tired of EVERY FUCKING PATCH DAY having
one hundred idiots coming here to say, "WTF??? I CAN'T PLAY! VERANT
SUXX0RZ!"

Some of their service is excellent. Other areas, particularly in
customer service, could use considerable improvement. Both, however, are
beyond my (or your) ability to influence.

I already did. Mine at least has a point. Yours, however, still comes
down to you whinging that you can't log in, your flame of VI for not
posting information which they *did* post, but you failed to read, and
... (yet AGAIN) the fact that your post was pointless drivel. The
servers are down. They are doing a major eight hour patch. You can't
play. Go feed your cat. it's probably very hungry by now.
