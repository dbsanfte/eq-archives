Hmm... care to elaborate what the weaknesses of dual wield vs. 2 handers
are?

The only weakness I'm aware of is that dual wielding one handers gives the
mob more chances to do riposte damage to you.   For a ranger this shouldn't
be much of an issue as they're not normally attacking from the front.

And warriors can get a fair amount of strikethrough from AA to somewhat
mitigate that weakness.
