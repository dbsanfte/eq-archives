Stonebrunt is also good at 37.  Follow the stream north and pull to the wall
on the right.  The animals sometimes drop gems.  No faction hits for animals
except for the rare named animals who occasionally appear.  However, they
will be indifferent to you and con red at 37 so you will be leaving them
alone anyway.  Avoid wolf form near the Kejekan people.  At 40 you'll need
to move on.  The baslisks in Jaggedpine are good to about 42.  Another
option is to port to Twilight Sea, zone into Katta, succor over to the other
side and hunt in Tenebrous Mtns at the Katta zone line.  Here you will kill
sonic wolves and bats.  Very safe with zone a few feet away.

As for Nedaria, I did read elsewhere that no experience was gained there.
Not sure if it's a bug or as intended.

In Jaggedpine the wolves, bears, and cats do have faction.  Someone can
correct me, but this is the only zone I can think of where you do take a
faction hit for killing animals.  No need to worry about it elsewhere.
