}I believe on the item description when right-clicking on the actual

}5% less chance of failure. That's how I would interpret it anyway.

Yes, adds 5% to -skill- not chance of success.  Note also that there'sa 
bug in the new UI where the '%' symbol is not displayed.  Verant has 
confirmed that it's a display bug, and your geerlok is stil +5%, not +5.
