While it's nice to make a gesture in memory of 9/11, some of us still find
the wound really raw. I do not wish to be reminded any more than I am
already.

And others of us just get really fucking ticked off with HTML posts that
include moving images and SOUND. Some newsreaders are just not built for
that, and others have crappy dialup connections or worse. So please avoid
posts like this in future. Or I'll really flame ya, dicknose.
