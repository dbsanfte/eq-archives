Dropped in dungeon.

Alt-V brings up the Adventure Window. All info is there.

Many drops in dungeon.

You are given 30 minutes from acceptance of adventure to get to the dungeon
start point. Once in you have either 60 minutes for hard (only did one hard
so not positive on that) or 90 minutes on normal (did many of them) to
finish.  Once the time is up you have another 30 minutes to bang around in
the dungeon if you wish to before getting booted out.  When you are asking
for an Adventure, you decide whether you want 'normal' or 'hard' as well as
what type (i.e. collecting things, rescue, assassination..)


Hope that helps!
