Well, it finally happened.  Ran into a major pack of assholes
on the E. Marr server last night while finishing up a piece of
my alt rogue's epic.

Kedge Keep.  Logged on in the Dreadlands to a guildee
asking if anybody wanted to help do Kedge.  Some guild
friends and some others wanted to take a couple of groups
and take down the tainted/corrupted room for druids and
maybe get the ground spawn from Phinny's room.

Then Phinny popped.  We called in some reinforcements,
and started pulling Guardians.  We were really stretching
it close, but a 56 monk was doing the pulling and we had
settled into a rhythm.  We had all but 4 guardians and
Phinny left when some folks started OOC'ing at the zone.

I'd already been promised the robe (only rogue in the zone,
and had been helping before Phinny was even around),
paladin had already been promised the fingerbone, and
we had a couple of casters/bards along that were rolling
for their pieces.  Folks show up at the zone were all
level 60, and after a kedge robe for the rogue's friend
(who was level 47, I know him) who wasn't even online
at the time.  The rogue was giving me nasty tells about
how they could "help" and if his group got the kill they
were taking the robe.  Several of our group petitioned,
and while still pulling Guardians the 60 monk said, "Here,
why wait?" and pulled all the guardians and Phinny.

Total wipeout.  14 people dead, his party was still sitting
at zone, and the monk was feigned in the Tainted room.

I think it ended up with 9 people /reporting him at the
same time, and the GM told us about 5 minutes later
that all 4 accounts had been suspended for 3 months,
with the monk's account banned for good.

I HATE doing something like that.  But I also still have a
hard time believing that somebody would deliberately be
such an asshole.  Worst thing was, that by the time we
got the corpses back (thank you rangers for camo/EB...
can't sneak in Kedge :-)  ), most of us had to log and
Phinny was still up.  Started the night thinking I just
might luck into my robe, and ended up seriously
pissed at an entire guild of shitheads and 4 people
in particular.

Some people...
