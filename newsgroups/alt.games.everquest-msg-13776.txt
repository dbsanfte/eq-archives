I generally just tolerate it when people inspect me, since I can't
stop them from doing it anyway; I don't get all defensive about it any
more; I figure there are a lot worse things somebody can do than
inspect me, like KS me or run their trains on top of me!  Plus, you
never know, it might not necessarily be some rude person who does it,
it might be some nice high-level player who wants to see what you
have, thinks you need something better and will give you something
really nice!     

I think I have had *one* person ask me first if they could inspect me,
after which I thanked them for asking me first and then gave them a
SOW.

It's funny, when I was brand new at this game, I didn't know what
inspecting was, and I used to think "so and so is looking at your
equipment" was some goofy pickup line or something!
