You know, this is how I have leveled my bard from level 27 to 46.  My
largest group I have successfully kited was 8 frost giants in about 15
minutes.  I've heard stories of other bards charm kiting 15 mobs.  I
tried 12 once and a few kept coming after me.

So, are Bards the most overpowered class in Everquest between levels
27-50?  Can Necro's or Druids solo better than Bards at these levels? 
I know playing a Bard requires a little more dexterity with the
keyboard and mouse than a lot of other classes, but even a piss-poor
Quake 3 player can handle the dexterity required to play a Bard.

I love playing the Bard class.  They are very effective soloer's and
they can offer a lot to a group depending on the group make-up.
