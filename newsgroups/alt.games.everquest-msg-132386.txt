Well since you asked...

I would say druid was the easiest to level into the 50s, though it beat
the shaman mostly because of the lower levels.  The druid was easy to
solo from level one while the shaman was a bit tougher in the late
teens, then came on strong in mid 20s.  The cleric was quite difficult
for the first 30 levels or so, the paladins a real challenge, though
personally I find the boredom of  playing a necro or a wizard to be the
absolute hardest classes for me.

btw, that druid I am referring to is my "hardship" druid.  Half Elf,
under 100 wis into  his 40s, poorly equipped, almost entirely soloed. 
Not able to quad anything but greens for faction.  Still the easiest to
50s by far.  That is why he wasn't an ubertwink halfling, had to do
something to make it a challenge or what is the point? <EG>
