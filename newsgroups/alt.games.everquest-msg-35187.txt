I have reached the part where I need the Jade Reaver, and would like to hear
of other's experience they have had with this.  I understand you need a 51+
rogue to pick a lock, and that the black reavers are like 95% MR, but what
worked good for you?  And how often does the Jade Reaver drop?

TIA, Danny
