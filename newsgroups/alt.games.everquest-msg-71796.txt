Long term strategic play is *why* some people want to zoom past the
low levels.  After you've played one or two characters to high level,
and played around with many others at low level, you reach a point
where low level characters are completely boring.  At new spell
levels, it does not take you long at all to learn to use your new
spells, and then it is an extremely boring time grinding out XP until
the next spell level.

It's not just your characters that level in this game.  *You* get
better, too, and at some point the low level game greens out to you.
