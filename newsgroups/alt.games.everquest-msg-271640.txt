I do know what the new regen and bandaging does, I've soloed him a few 
times in Crystal Caverns since those changes, and the difference is huge.  
I have had Aego a couple times from a friend, so I do know what effect 
this type of buff has as well.  Last time I soloed him was shortly after 
the regen change.
