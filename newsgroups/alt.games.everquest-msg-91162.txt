I once spent ten hours waiting for a ferry boat to arrive (in real 
life!). They kept stringing out the passengers claiming it was due in an 
hour, in another hour, etc. so people kept waiting even though each 
supposed arrival time came and went. The staff could have easily rung up 
/ radioed the boat to ask when it was due but apparantly they thought it 
better to invent arrival times out of thin air.

In the end the boat finally turned up but so late that they cancelled 
the sailing. The waiting passengers were furious by then and the police 
had to be called to protect the ferry staff. It was a total disaster for 
the operators since they managed to turn an entire boatful of customers 
against them *and* ended up giving refunds anyway. It could have been 
avoided simply by telling the passengers the truth in the first place 
instead of stringing them along or giving out no information at all.

The moral of this story is its always better PR to be honest than to 
lie, bullshit or say nothing when things go wrong. Most people will 
accept an apology if accompanied by a reasonable explanation for a 
delay. Saying nothing at all makes you look cold, indifferent and 
incompetant.
