Lol. The first i don't know much about... I thought it was an archery 
item. (??) 

The 2nd won't do squat. It will increase your chance at making a double 
attack everytime EQ checks to see if you made one. Since, as a cleric 
you don't have the ability, EQ never checks, and thus never increases 
your chances.
