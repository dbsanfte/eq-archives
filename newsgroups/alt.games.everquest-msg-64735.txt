yeah that would work.. if it is your HDD low on room, try this to speed up
EQ even more.
Get your new HDD...
instead of putting EQ on the new drive, reinstall other stuff to the new
one, EQ should run fastest on the HDD with the OS, assuming its not a slow
drive.
I think 7200rpm is the fastest IDE drive
