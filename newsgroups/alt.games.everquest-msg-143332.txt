I've only verified variable pricing on a few vendors.  Race does
affect pricing for some vendors tho, even when indifferent or better.
Easy test of this, if you care, is to make two paladins to Mith Marr
in NFP, one half-elven and one human, leave both with default 85 CHA.
Now check prices with various NFP vendors, including those in both
temples and those in the Office of the People (all human, all should
be indiff or better), and the half-elven vendors near the bank (the
Greenglades).
Never seen or heard of any vendor who cares about faction better than
indifferent (I mentioned that both chars were amiable to make it clear
that faction wasn't an issue).
