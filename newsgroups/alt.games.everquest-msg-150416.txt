I never ran into Linvarwen, but I'm seriously wondering if he switched 
servers.

Today in Oasis I was hanging out soloing next to two guildies, one of 
whom was semi-PLing another.  This guy runs up and hails the lower level 
and asks if he can rejoin the group, and she points out that there is no 
group, and goes back to being PL'd.  Guy then turns to the PLer and asks 
(constantly in d00d speak, btw) if he can join the group and if he can 
join the guild.  At this moment, things go horribly wrong and our poor 
PL'd girl dies badly.  I and the PLer slap things around until they're 
dead.  I sit down, completely oom, and the poor guilt-laden PLer sets 
about finding the dead girl a rez.  He runs off to take the body to a 
cleric, so the d00d-speaker turns to me, hails me, and asks *me* if he 
can join the guild.  Twitching and trying to ignore the many "plz"s I 
say I'm not an officer.  "Cn u chk if ny r on?"

::twitch::

I check officers and point out that this person in Oasis wants an 
invite.  Then I gate to firepots, run to HHK (and bind myself there - !
@#$!#$@ moron that I am ><) and camp for work.

Four hours later I come back, find myself a group, and get a tell from 
this guy that I'd exchanged all of five words conversation with.  He 
tries to chat me up and I tell him I'm very busy - the GR room is 
tending toward "let's all pop on them at once" strategies, and with no 
enchanter, we can't spread them out any.  We're doing okay, it's just 
that once I get into battle, there's absolutely no room for anything 
else.  I miss a lot of /g say, /guild I'm not even paying attention to, 
and the occasional illiterate tell I get from him is... weird.  I 
finally ask him to lay off when he comes out with "a/s/l?" and he starts 
ranting at me about how he's just trying to be friends and I'm not very 
friendly.  I ignore him and continue playing.  Later I get more tells 
from him.  I answer with short replies, discouraging conversation.  He 
doesn't get the hint, and rants again.  Finally I tell him to try /guild 
chat if he wants to be social, and he jumps into guild chat, says one 
thing, then complains that nobody will talk to him (remember, at this 
point, he's been in the guild all of six hours) and how this guild is 
just like his last guild (hmm...) and he's just going to kill himself 
and people are mean.  More tells in my direction lead me to tell him in 
guild chat that I'm putting him on ignore, and to back off NOW.  I throw 
him on ignore for 5 minutes, then take him off (hey, ignore is limited, 
and they usually get the hint).

Oh, did I mention?  While all this was going on he asked that someone 
lead him from West Freeport to Surefall Glade.  A VERY 50-something nice 
warrior agreed to do it, and soon regretted it.  The kid kept wandering 
off and getting lost, and the warrior was getting more and more jumpy as 
he was KOS in the Karanas.  Still, he was admirably patient, and didn't 
give up until West Karanas, when the kid exploded at him and stalked off 
to sit under a tree and sulk, and disbanded himself from the guild.  
Apparently, after that he went from blaming the guild to himself to 
threatening to kill himself to saying he wasn't going to kill himself to 
saying it was his parent's fault for buying him a computer and EQ to get 
rid of him to ... ready?

Ask the warrior if he was an officer, because he wanted to be invited 
back into the guild.

MEANWHILE... he's also sending tells to yet ANOTHER guildie who tried to 
talk to him about what was wrong, and getting worse and worse, until 
this poor guildie, who apparently has not ignored anyone in the two 
years they've played EQ ('wow' is all I can say...) finally puts the kid 
on ignore.

The warrior is getting frustrated enough to contemplate killing a few 
guards to mess with the kid's faction *g*  The kid quits the group and 
storms off in a huff and sits under a tree somewhere in the middle of 
WK.

One hour later, the guild is still stunned and discussing the wierdness, 
and the kid is now in a new guild.  I'm still wondering what his last 
guild was.  Now I'm curious as to how long he's been pulling this stunt. 
:)
