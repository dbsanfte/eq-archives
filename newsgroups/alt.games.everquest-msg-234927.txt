Problem is, the majority of their long-term players are hard-core full
timers. I've been playing for nearly 5 years now, and have had a lot
of time to invest. There are still a lot of zones I've never seen.
Just because a zone is there doesn't mean you HAVE to try to get to
it.

By the way, when was Befallen ever popular? :p Maybe pre-Kunark, but I
can't recall any time after that it was ever really popular...
