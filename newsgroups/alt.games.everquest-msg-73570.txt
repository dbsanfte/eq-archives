D&D, as originally envisioned by Gary Gygax and his crew, was cut from
hole cloth straight out of the Lord of the Rings. Of course, once you
get past the books and into the mechanics of having to come up with a
gaming system with a variety of classes, you have to start reserving
various skills, strong points, etc. for certain classes and restricting
them from others. Hence the wizards had most of their melee abilities
taken away and given to the fighting types. In the book, however,
Gandalph and his circle of Wizzy buddies were pretty much the do all/end
all of power.
