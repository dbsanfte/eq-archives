Yes it does . Yesterday at consorts a full group including chanter(me) ,
cleric, monk , magician , wizard, and warrior where frequently ksed by Duran
our clerics main ranger who was sitting out of group just firing arrows. He
was outdammaging a full group that included 2 melee and 2 good offensive
casters. Duran is of course a hunter at 65 with 100 or so aa .

Archery dammage is way above monk dammage and frequently above rogue
dammage. I dont really care since we need the most dammage we can scrounge
but even hinting that the monk nerf was in some way required for balance is
just laughable. Monks are now broken badly .
