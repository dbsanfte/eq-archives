Well, that explains everything - you're speaking some crazy moon
language that looks and sounds like English. I didn't have that
conversation. Annie may have had it, you may have read it, but I submit
that both of you are getting newsfeeds from an alternate universe if
that is the case.

Anyway, for the record - I did not undermine any "pretense" of not
wanting to offend. I abandoned the desire to not offend. There was no
pretense - I didn't want to offend. I didn't want to do anything to
offend. However, given Annie's inexplicable response (and your
inexplicable interpretation of events), I have to assume you're working
by rules you make up as you go along.

And if that's the case, or if you disagree with my interpretation, the
best solution for you - for any of you who care to defend Annie's
implausibly thin skin - is to filter my address and not try to respond
to me.

Jesus Christ, next time I see someone about to step into a bear trap,
I'll seriously consider whether to let them know where they're about to
put their foot.

Hey, you're the one who said:

"Speaking of adults who are arrogant: take a look in a mirror."

Most of us outgrew that kind of comeback in the 5th grade.
