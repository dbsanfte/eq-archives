I completely understand what you are saying, and I agree it could
happen. I just don't feel that it's anything that is too difficult to
avoid. Put all your items for sale in their own containers, simple as
that. What if that's not an option? Then you're aware of the risk.
Don't show containers and items together. I'm not gonna argue the
point, it's really quite simple. If you are wanting to sell something,
you make it convenient for the prospective buyer. If you don't, you
end up looking like you're trying to hide something or just being
difficult.

That's commendable. I wish I could feel confident that EVERYONE lists
all "pertinent" info in the auction (keeping in mind that pertinent is
a subjective term). I would never ask to see anything if that were the
case. However, we both know that most people leave something out.

If you feel that the risk of losing your items is so great that you
don't want to take a chance SHOWING it to anyone, you should probably
investigate a more reliable connection. I DID lose two full bags of
rather expensive items on a cancelled trade once. No LD, just a little
lag and poof. A GM got them back for me. Never had any trouble aside
from that incident, and I don't feel it necessary to be too paranoid
about it.
