What would also be nice would be if once you reached grand master (or
250) you could specialise. Say a smith specialised in AC, all his armour
would get +1 AC to the stats. Or a brewer could specialise in stamina or
a Jeweler in SvP. This would make the player made items by masters more
unique.

Having said this balancing it could be fun :-/

Perhaps you could do it like AA skills, every combine after reaching 250
skill gets a chance of specialise fireing or increasing (perhaps only on
stats that the manufactured item would have).

Say I'm a 250 skill master smith and I'm trying to make Fancy imbubed
plate pants (AC 50 STR+10 STA+10 SvP+20) Trivial at over 250. Each time
I try the specialisations for AC STR STA and SvP are checked for sucess
and raise in addition to the normal checks e.g. :

You have suceeded in making something new !
You have failed in your attempt to improve the AC
You have succeeded in your attempt to improve the STR
You have failed in your attempt to improve the STA
You have got better at Smithing(STA) (11)
You have Suceeded in your attempt to improve the SvP
You have got better at Smithing(SvP) (18)

Resulting item :
AC 50 STR+11 STA+10 SvP+30 Made by GM Follon

Now that would be sweet.

Humm PoP has new "planar" Trade skills stuff ...
