Actually it was 9 last time, and typically goes to 12.

For me it's one day out of 5, since I can only play in the mornings on
weekdays.  If it were every week it'd be 1/5 of my playing time, that's
pretty significant.  As it is it averages 1/10 of my playing time, which
is tolerable, but just barely.  EQ has the worst CS of any MMORPG and if
it weren't the best content wise, I wouldn't be there, and have quit in
the past for some time because of the lousy CS.

In any case I defend my right to complain, and everyone elses.
