Character models are awesome.
Trolls were thinned a little too much.  No biggie, but I liked the 'ol
chubby trolls!
Skeletons in action are hilarious!
My Bard got fucked over, but this is supposedly temporary says tech support.
Many video bugs, but I'm sure they will be worked out.  Can you say
"floating mobs"???
They could have added something better than tiger people from the moon.
Kind of "Planet of the Apes" type of hooey that strays away from the "dark
ages" scenario, but I'll get over it.  Actually I'm already over it.
Are the moon zones choppy and stuttering for anyone else?
The sitting positions are cool.  I don't know, but the first time I saw a
female character sitting so very "lady-like" with her legs tucked to one
side, I just smiled (no I'm not a pervert!).  Excellent "human" touch to the
game.  However!  A female troll shouldn't sit like this.  It's just plain
WRONG!

Things I wish they had added.
Casters should be scrawny.  My Human Necro looks like he can bench press an
Ogre.  OK, maybe this is a little naggy but if my Necro is taking steroids
he should be much better at melee!
Maybe an actual "tune" for Bard songs would have been cool.  Just something
simple, nothing overboard.
I wish we could add some of the new character features to existing
characters, like beards, eye color, etc.  Of course only allowing you to
change it once.

Enough of this hooey.  OK so far and I'm sure it will only get better.
Safe travels to all.
