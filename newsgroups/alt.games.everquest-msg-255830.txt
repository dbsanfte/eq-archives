Depends on the place, in BoT or something I can keep the mob targetted,
still shooting it, turning round at the last minute to grab the next mob,
you have to  know the zones pretty well.  With summoning mobs its not really
a good idea to damage them on incoming though :)

Yes, it is instant with a 7 second refresh (never fades, 20min base
duration).  Works indoors / outdoors / underwater, wherever.  It is very
nice to pull non social mobs also.

True, but running is not always an option either.

Yes, we get shrew and pack shrew, I havent got it though.

Yep, I have seen great pullers of lots of classes your wouldnt usually
expect to pull (wizards, for example).

Ranger 'ghetto' CC is actually quite effective, as long as the cleric doesnt
complain because 'shock horror' they get hit a little sometimes while doing
it.  Any cleric moan at me, I stop doing CC for long enough to make them
realise it was actually saving them mana :P

But I agree (though I am no expert on the class), there is not much a
berserker can do to control adds, if anything.

Yep, some people hate pulling for some reason, I like it myself, it is a
challenge sometimes, depending on where you are fightiing.  Looks like they
may be removing ranger ability to pull in the future though (HoN is not
being upgraded).
