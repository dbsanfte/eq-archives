As soon as something like this happens, you need to *immediately*
petition.  There have been several client-side speed hacks, and there
are very likely still some that work.  Verant takes a dim view of
them, and if you are caught using one, your account will be banned.
If they catch you running faster than you should, and you say you have
no idea why it is doing that, they are *NOT* going to believe you.
