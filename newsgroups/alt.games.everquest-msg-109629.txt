Nah, they shot that one down so many times. They are planning on doing
something similar though they said; they want to make it so that when
30 people kill X uber BOSS mobs they all get some of the XP.

The more than six person group idea is shot down because they say the
entire game is balanced for a max six person group for most level
appropriate encounters. This is pretty much true. 

Your 8 man or even unlimted group idea is another reason they said
they'd not do this. As they said, if they gave in to the idea of 8 man
groups people would be wanting 10. If they gave in to 10 people would
want 12. Soon you'd have very unmanageble 15 person groups which would
just mow down mobs like crazy for xp with little or no challenge. I
mean, currently you might have 6 six person groups in a place like
velks and have it be fairly "camped out." Imagine if instead of 6 six
person groups doing their own thing, you had 36 people in velks  all
sharing xp just killing everything. It would simply be too easy. There
has to be a cut off point somewhere and since they balanced the game
for six it just seems to make the most sense. 

Six or 8 or so is kind of the standard computer roleplaying game party
limit  and has been since they first begain, for the same balance
reasons.
