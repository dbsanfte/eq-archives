As far as I know they are seperate rolls to disregard damage done to you. So
in your words "give a very tiny chance to avoid an attack".

Incoming blow:
1 roll for parry, if fail go to 2, if succes make an immediate attack to the
target.and return
2 roll for hit/miss based off atk and ac, if hit go to 3, if miss return
3 roll for dodge, if fail go to 4, if success return
4 roll amount of damage and apply

The percentage of the rolls I have no clue about. Pretty sure dodge is after
hit/miss because you do DS damage if you dodge, but not if you parry or an
incoming blow misses; which means DS damage is "tagged" when fase 3 steps
in.

If I'm off with the DS damage please switch step 2 and 3 :).
