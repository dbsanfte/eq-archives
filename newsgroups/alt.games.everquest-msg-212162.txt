I played the beta and my impression was it was RAW it reminded me of a
watered down DAOC.
There is nothing out there currently that can compare with EQ. DAOC is in my
opinion the only thing that even comes close. (No offense to the other games
out there.)
Go to www.mmoprg.com to find a list of games and coming games and read
reviews and chat with players about them.
