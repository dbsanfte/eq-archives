Beastlords can solo very well. I solo Giants and Goblins in FM right now for great loot and good XP. For really fast XP I team up
with a SK friend at the Giant fort and we chain pull them and fast as we can with only a little break after about 15 or so giants.
We usually make about 100pp an hour but have made 500pp in one hour when drops are good. I have soloed in OT on thornys, stoneleers
and beserkers also but the loot sucks there.
