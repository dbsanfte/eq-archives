Unless the item is nodrop, the gypsy probably still had it.

Got a superb lion pelt once (to this day, no one knows what it's for,
but it still sits in my bank).  This was before HQ lion hides were in
game.  Geb Somethingorother who makes gloves from various pelts was
asking for an HQ lion skin and some coin to make a pair of gloves. 
Tried giving him the coin and the superb lion pelt, and got the
typical "thank you" reply.

Killed him and got it back.


Now if you handed them a manastone and a bunch of other crap, the
manastone might get pushed out of the lootable inventory space and
you'd only get the other crap when you looted it.  From my
experiments, an NPC can hold about 4 items before they start
discarding them.
