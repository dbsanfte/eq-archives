the usual method is for the PLer to be a druid, or maybe shaman or
enchanter.  damage shields are probably the single best PLing tool,
at least at low-medium levels.  you're going to have a tough time
PLing with a paladin.

your best strategy would probably be to pull mobs with your pally,
take them down to 55% or so, then let the PLee kill them.  pally
will buff, heal and stun as needed.
