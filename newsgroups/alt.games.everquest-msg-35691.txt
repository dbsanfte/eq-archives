Its an old bug. What happened is the mob got stuck "under the world"
Happens a lot. FoB has a major problem with it. In EK I track hill giants
under the world all the time, same thing with kodiaks in GD.

I don't know why this bug is so damn hard to fix. Just check the z axis
of the mob and if its too low move it up. WTF is so hard about that?
