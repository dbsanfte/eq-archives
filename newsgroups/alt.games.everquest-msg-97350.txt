They're not going to be that useful in XP groups, IMO.

But they'll be extremely useful in raid situations.  Even
a 15% reduction in mana cost will help with speeding
up pre-raid buffing.   And clerics will find any reduction
in Complete Heal casting time useful as well.  And
wizards casting Lures with increased damage, less mana,
and faster cast times?

These will be VERY much in demand on raids, IMO, especially
since when you're talking about specific mob kills and not
"zone" raids.   Just ask your typical cleric in a CHeal chain
how much he'd like faster, less-mana CHeals, especially if
the items take less mana away than they save over the
course of a fight.
