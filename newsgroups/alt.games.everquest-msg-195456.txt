    Exactly. The devs placed a very high premium on high STR/STA, as those
were considered to be the most important combat stats. Especially back in
the original game, when capping STA was very difficult and every point
counted.

    And in the original game, Kick capped quite a ways below Bash (the skill
a Barb Warrior uses when he Slams) and couldn't insta-interrupt spells like
Bash can. So it was quite an advantage.
