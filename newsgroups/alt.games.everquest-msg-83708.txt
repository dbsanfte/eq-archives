YEAH! I agree completely. Obviously you're a  Druid or a Wiz (You mentioned
porting), and both classes need loot just as much as a warrior or monk. Any
group that gives you crap, you have every right to leave. AND, your guild
should stand behind you on something like that. If they didn't, I say leave
them.

If you're on Fennin Ro, Join the Dark Knights, we're a great guild :)
