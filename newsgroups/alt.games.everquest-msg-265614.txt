They are not consistent with a UNIVERSAL convention, they're consistent
with an EQ convention.
This isn't EQ.

Gee Sparky that's funny since the "issue" that sparked this whole debate
was KDragon's whine about having the boss of a pack repeatedly killed by
a third party.
KDragon would slowly wipe out the minions around the boss and just when
the boss was alone, the "kill stealer" would jump in and quickly destroy
the boss.

The boss KDragon hadn't actually fought yet and had down no to minimal
damage to.

So what you're saying is by the mechanic YOU favor, KDragon wasn't kill
stolen at all since KDragon DIDN'T DO THE MAJORITY of the damage.

>See any flaws in that logic? (I mean other than the fact that its widely 
>known that killstealing is a non-trivial problem in EQ).

It's a non-trivial problem because the mechanics make it possible to
kill steal while CoH's don't.
You still don't get it - in CoH you will get a share of exp for any
damage you did. 

Under the EQ mechanic you describe, a more powerful character can swoop
in while the mob is less than half dead and do 51%+ damage to it and get
ALL THE EXP - thus having STOLEN the exp the first person would have
earned.  The exp that they worked for but did NOT receive.

In CoH, that self same more powerful character swoops in and does 51% of
the damage in one shot and gets - DING - 51% of the exp while the person
they attempted to kill steal got the 49% they had actually earned.

The notion of kill stealing as it exists in EQ doesn't apply at all to
CoH since you will ALWAYS get exp for the damage you actually did.

You can't lose the exp you worked for because someone else came along
and did the majority of the damage and thus "stole" your exp, you will
ALWAYS get your share.

The game mechanics in CoH DO NOT SUPPORT EQ style kill stealing.
You cannot deprive me of the exp I have _earned_ no matter what you do.

[Well ok, I suppose you could haul a train of mobs down on me getting me
killed, then make sure that no one else touched the mob I was fighting
and should it despawn, then i'll have lost the exp I earned since it
never died.]

The choice is up to you.

Since i'm not American I have zero interest in the Kerry vs Bush rants,
but you know what, i've run into pretty much none of them.
The only place they were occurring with any regularity was Atlas Park,
one of the two newbie zones, so they weren't intruding on me since none
of my characters fights in that zone

Because kill stealing as you envision it DOES NOT EXIST.

Attacking what I am could be a mistake, could be you thinking you're
helping me, could be lots of things.
BUT 
Once you've been told that your "assistance" is not wanted, continuing
to "help" me against my wishes is harassment.

It's not that you're killing "my" mobs, it's you directly interfering in
my play.

In another post you mention that you do not like the "random acts of
kindness" since it trivializes what might otherwise be a tough fight.

If you tell Mr High level healer that you do NOT want his assistance,
him continuing to "help" you against your wishes is harassment.

Killing the mobs you're fighting, 
healing you, 
buffing you,
debuffing the mobs you're fighting,  
provoking most of a crowd off you while not hurting them, 
locking down the group you're fighting with a zero damage hold; 
These are all examples where someone else can directly affect your
gameplay experience.  
Only the first one would net the "helper" any experience, but all of
them happen regularly.

None of them is against the rules.

All of them are harassment if they are done repeatedly AGAINST YOUR
WISHES.

No they don't because the underlying mechanics that allow actual theft
of exp in EQ do NOT exist in CoH.

No it's not founded on that at all in COH.
The harassment comes from another person's unwanted "help" AFTER they
have been informed that it is unwanted.

Sorry 42, you declaring something doesn't make it reality.

Like it or not, the only thing in CoH that you "own" is your door
missions.
No one else can even get into those, much less take away your ownership
of them,  unless you invite them to team with you.

Why yes they do, where a person who gets NO EXP for the kill "steals"
the kill from you by doing 100% of the damage before you can engage the
critter.  Pure griefer activity, since they get no gain by killing it
EXCEPT depriving you.

In every other case, they can't "kill steal" EQ-style because they
cannot, under any circumstances, take the exp you actually earned.

They are germane because of the different mechanics.

In EQ it is actually possible to steal exp out from under someone by
doing the majority of the damage.

In CoH that is simply NOT POSSIBLE.

Your EQ conventions grew in an environment where it was possible to
steal exp, an environment where SOE refused to actually have rules until
after the player base had come up with conventions to take the place of
the missing rules.

CoH on the other hand was designed to make EQ style exp theft
IMPOSSIBLE, so EQ conventions about "theft" don't apply, because the
mechanics those conventions relate to does not exist.

No it's not because Kill Stealing as it exists in EQ, does not exist in
CoH and CAN'T because the game mechanics DELIBERATELY do not support it.

Because the game was designed to make it impossible to steal exp, kill
stealing as you think of it does not exist in COH, and CAN'T.

That's the reality and that's official policy.

It's not against the rules so complaining about it is beyond pointless.

Complain about things that are actually not allowed if you want your
complaint taken seriously.

Had KDragon complained about harassment - which is what was happening -
than the complaint would have been taken seriously and the problem dealt
with.


There's one more small detail that needs to be considered here which
isn't mentioned in KDragon's posts;
Did KDragon tell the "kill stealer" not to do it or just steam silently
and move on to the next batch?

If KDragon didn't tell this person to go away, then they may have
assumed that KDragon was perfectly OK with them killing the boss out of
every pack, since KDragon was a controller and might have had great
difficulty in killing a boss.
