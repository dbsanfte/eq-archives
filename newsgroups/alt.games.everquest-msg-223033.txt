Addendum -

here is an example of an entry in the .ini file

[Trivial]
Texture=TargetIndicator
TwistFactor=1.0
TwistSpeed=0.0
FrameCount=0
Duration=0
TextureScale=.1
TextureSpeed=0.001
ScaleMin=0.5
ScaleMax=1.5
ScaleSpeed=1.0
Alpha=240
Red=0
Green=255
Blue=0

Note that each section has a
Texture=SomePic
line.

For those people who are very colorblind (biz)
this could be a godsend.  Expect in a very short
while for someone to release 6 textures - a different
appearance for each con.  Then you won't be reliant
on color for telling cons apart.

It's time to play with the other variables now, it's
possible that you can have them rotating at different
speeds as well.
