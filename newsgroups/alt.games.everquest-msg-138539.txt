Well, like I said...it's nice to see somebody playing
a NON twinked rogue (I'm even guilty of it a bit myself)
these days, even with the improvements to the class.

Many rogues are a second or third character, who are
born with some pretty uber gear and haven't learned
about some of the weird "I'm not quite a tank and not
a caster and I can't FD and I can't....but watch me poke
stuff!" intracacies of the class.

The stuff was just sitting on some alts that I don't really
play (like the paly in all black plate named "Innoruuks
Disciple": he was a RP attempt at a High Elf who thought
he was a shadowknight...he's actually pretty well factioned
in Neriak ;-)  ).  I'd rather see somebody interested in the
rogue class as a whole get some use out of that gear
than have it just sitting around in the Warrens or something...
;-)

Hope it's helping!
