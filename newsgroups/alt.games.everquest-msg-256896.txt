I agree that more damage means smoother hunts... but marginal 
improvements won't really do that.

Improve your damage output by 1%, you save your healers 2% of their mana 
use at best.

In a group, though, that "at best" figure isn't likely to be reached, as 
you are probably not the only person doing damage.  Say you have 3 
damage producers, and all of them are at your exact DPS.  Now that 1% 
improvement to one person's DPS is really a .25% improvement to the 
group's DPS, saving, at best .5% of a healer's mana.

But wait, you're a paladin.  This means your DPS isn't likely on a par 
with the other three people in your group, lets say there's one other 
plate tank who has your DPS, and the other two people doing damage are 
outdamaging you by 50%.  Now we're looking at 1/6th of a percent 
improvement in group DPS.

But as paladin you're likely the MT, so your output drops another 15% 
because you're being stunned, riposted, blocked, dodged, and parried, 
while the rest of the DPS team are not.

Instead of spending lots of cash (if "thousands and thousands" doesnt' 
translate to lots of cash my arguement collapses, as spending trivial 
amounts on trivial improvements isn't a big deal; but I assumed the 
general terms to mean "significant money/effort") on a marginal 
improvement in DPS, I'd be looking for ways to spend the same cash/LDoN 
points on something that will make a bigger difference.

Can you improve your armor/avoidance enough to make a 1% difference in 
tanking ability?  Given that you are often MT, that will make roughly 4 
times as much difference as the same improvement to your DPS in my example.

Further, AC is incremental, you can add up a bunch of small improvements 
to make a big improvement.  Adding a proc to a weapon isn't incremental, 
  the only way to get further improvement out of procs is to rip that 
proc off and put a bigger one on, in which case, instead of spending on 
the little one it might have been better to save up for the bigger one, 
spending less total overall on getting to it.

Does that proc we were discussing add hate?  Keeping the aggro on you 
will save lots more healer mana than an increase in DPS, and may help 
save lives.

Procs that haste or slow or add DS or resists or runes or stun or... 
well there's quite a list; seems to me that procs with lasting effects 
are generally better than procs that simply do a little extra damage. 
Unfortunately, I don't think you can buy that kind of proc as an augment.
