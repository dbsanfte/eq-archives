A guild unable to kill Vindi yet, really has no chance in hell of killing
the Statue....besides the hammer of battle is monk lewtz, back off!

Whilst the warrior fights may be tedious, they might be highly desired, they
most certainly aren't all *tough* mobs.  (The queen is actually a very easy
mob if you have good damage output, its just a bitch of a pull)... I don't
see any 32khp mobs comparing to, for example, a mob hitting around 1000,
with hundreds of thousends of hp
