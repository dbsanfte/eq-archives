I just had the first time today where a calmed mob actually came after
me, when an angry one walked by it.  It's been pretty rediculous so
far.  I could walk right through them even and they would normally just
sit there, had to hit one this morning to get him to come.

Ah.  Berzerker works too, but short duration, and a little time till it
repops.  Not what I'd call "healing", but it's more effective than the
stien.

the lull line is looking much more like it would be crowd control to me
than berzerker/rune comes to healing.  Tempted to try it with my chanter
:)  - Mez, lull, memblur.  Mob wakes up and just walks away even though
he's 1' from fighting.  Definately have to play with it asap.  O.k. you
just gave me a reason to play my enchanter again :) I can never resist
trying out new combos.
