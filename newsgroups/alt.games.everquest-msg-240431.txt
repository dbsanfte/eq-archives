Do you even know how 3D accelerators work?  Sure, Everquest doesn't
make full use of the "GPU" bits of modern graphics cards, but it uses
the 3D acceleration hardware.  According to what Sony claimed at the
time Lucling was released, Everquest does indeed use the GPU, for
transform & lighting (unless, of course, Sony is lying about this).

Even if it didn't use those features of the GPU, it would still be
using the 3D acceleration features for rasterisation, which is pretty
much what most 3D accelerators did in 1999.  Now, you could argue that
that isn't using the GPU (if you limit "GPU" to meaning "only the bits
which don't render triangles into pixels", for example), but it's
still using 3D acceleration.
