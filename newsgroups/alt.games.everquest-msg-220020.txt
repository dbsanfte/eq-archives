Too old for RTS games?  I always considered RTS games to be more suited to
the older folks who don't have the reflexes for a twitchfest anymore.  :P

I never understood why that game was so popular, but then I was never much
on pen-n-papers so I played it as "just another game" instead of "I used to
do this in highschool".

It is a first-person hack-n-slash game with chat and all the social aspects
that come from persistency in character (not game) development and a massive
playerbase.  I call it the best possible mix of Quake, IRC and Muds, if that
gives you a good idea of what sort of game it might be.

No clue for euros, $12.95 a month U.S. ($13.95? I haven't looked at my bill
since they changed the rate).

Cheating in the purely technical sense is mostly impossible.  Nobody is
hacking themselves super weapons.  As far as maturity...  there is a
*massive* player base.  The maturity comes in all levels, and you can
usually find a like-minded group of people after you've played a bit.
