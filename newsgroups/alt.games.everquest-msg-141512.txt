Yes. The general theory is to put one point in all of them then practice
the one you desire until it breaks fifty. You've already done the
annoying part, so just put a point in all of them then cast alteration
spells until it dings 51. After that you are set, because none of the
others will ever go past fifty.

Whenever you like. Stop by a trainer, put one point in each, and proceed
as above.

You will already be "specializing" in the others. But you can only take
the others to fifty after your primary one breaks fifty. Go for it.
