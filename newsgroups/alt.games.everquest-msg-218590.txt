Your kidding right. :) Zone = Random Death should never have been part 
of the vision.

Greedy buggers should hurt the party's chances for a win.

Yep.

I moved mine onto the tilde. Q is better than A... but its still a letter.

I think the point of this was to get true noobies into the game faster, 
and more reliably, more than shave some wasted time.

The first time I played EQ it took hours to find my guild leader, figure 
out how to equip and scribe spells, and find my way to the newbie yard.

I really *should* have started there, staff in hand, spells memmed, 
ready to fight a moss snake...you know: engage me in the fun part of the 
game before forcing me to learn about all the hours I'm going to spend 
sitting on my ass and staring at the spell book (thankfully long gone now).

I think that's more of a problem now. With the new 
fast-easy-leveling(tm) my new Druid made 11th level before I realized I 
hadn't picked up my 9th level spells.

Yep, healing one or two points of damage: they're pointless at low skill 
levels, better off just sitting there, plus you'll burn through the 
stack by level 3, and then wonder what the point is since they cost 5 
silver each, and the average kill eats up 3/4s of your health and uses 
10+ bandages (5 gold!) to heal up to 50% and is only dropping 1 silver 3 
copper... and maybe a 1gp rusty weapon if your lucky... with 1 kill in 
30 being worth a whole plat (cracked staff, coyote skull, etc)

Yep!

Yep :( Just what we needed more of.

I disagree. typing it once per character (ever) is less aggravating than 
having to manually rejoin or drop them every time you log in if you 
do/don't want particular characters in particular chats.
