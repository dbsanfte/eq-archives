anyone else getting these looping ambient sounds.... like near the
bandit camps..    makes me think of the old Pink Floyd song 
Several species of small furry animals gathered together in a cave
grooving with a Pict.     
and its on a very short loop cycle...  very short.... oh did I say it
was on a Very short loop cycle.   I have to turn my speakers off to
stop me from going crazy.

I have deleted all the cache files, and the problem persists.... is
this what the zone is supposed to sound like... if so IT SUCKS.


good hunting
