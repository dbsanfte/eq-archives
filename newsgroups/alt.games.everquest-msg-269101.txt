Who could ever forget the likes of Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson or 
Jeffrey Dohmer (sp)?   Still infamous after all these years, even 
dead.

There are lots on both sides on the good/evil fence I could name. 
Some that only I know because they effected my life personally and I 
will never forget them for it.  None of them has to do things over and 
over for me to remember them, they have done enough.

My point is that when you look at the palyer base as a whole a small 
percetage is going to go through the hoops to get the guild rewards. 
Just like in life, a small percent is remembered beyond their years. 
It all kind of fits no matter what them that whiners on either side of 
the issue say.
