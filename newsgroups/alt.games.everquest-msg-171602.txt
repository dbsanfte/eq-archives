Actually, you get a speed increase and no increase in time you can hold your
breath.  Of course since moving faster means you can go further in the time
you -do- hold your breath, this works out much the same if you are just trying
to get from one air pocket to the next.  But if you are trying to do something
underwater, say loot a body for example, a 200 skill will stead you no better
than a 2 skill.  What will reportedly help is more stamina... although anyone
who can give you substantially more stamina can probably also cast a spell on
you that prevents your having to breathe at all.
