I haven't gotten that far in the game yet, but from what I gather once you hit, I 
think it's 51?, then you will use the % meter in your inventory window to dictate 
how much of your regular exp will go instead to aa exp. If you put it to 50% it 
would take you twice as long to gain a regular level, but you'd gain aa exp 
levels faster than if you had it at just 10%.

That's about all I know on the subject and for all I know I'm incorrect. lol
