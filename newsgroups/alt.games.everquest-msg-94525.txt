Actually, according to the PNP, yes, the group did KS it. Verant does
*not* recognize the right of an individual or group to claim (or "camp")
a spawn under any circumstances. I personally think it's a pretty stupid
policy and it *is* counter to conventional player etiquette; but, like
it or not, that is how it reads. As far has Verant is concerned, the mob
belongs to whoever engages it first. A GM will see it that way if they
happen to witness the incident. Well, actually, the GM will either be
laughing his ass off at you, or be pissed because you /petitioned over
something so trivial; but either way, they are supposed to enforce the
rules as defined by Verant. There are a lot of mobs in HH (which
incidentally *is* considered a FFA zone on many/most servers), they
spawn pretty fast, and fer cryin' out loud, it's only an orc (or a gnoll
or whatever.) What, are you afraid the other guy might have gotten to
loot the rusty long sword of uberness out from under you? =P
