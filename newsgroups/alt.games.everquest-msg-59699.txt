    So: no entering an area without full intelligence about who could be in
the area and a means of escaping/killing them all, or bringing sufficient
numbers to counter any expected attack. Sounds solid for war - makes for a
poor gaming experience. Muhtaq's description of hiding in a corner of
Skyfire to level didn't sound very pleasant, although he WAS one of the most
hunted on his server by choice.

    Patently untrue. True on the first day a PvP server comes up, before
anyone has chosen a class, then untrue for every day after that. So the
newts and the goods on Sullon Zek started equal with the evil team? Casters
are equal with melees? Everyone has equal access to
friends/guildmates/teammates to help defend them? All race/class
combinations have equally safe areas to level in? These aren't things you
care about in a simulation, but they are concerns in a game. PvP MMOGs are
supposed to be games.

    Now THIS I agree with. 8)  If you don't like PvP, you shouldn't play it
and expect the world to change for you.
