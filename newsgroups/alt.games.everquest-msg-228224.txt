These sorts of techniques work in EQ, actually, and I used to use them 
back in the day, when I didn't know how to automate sense heading so it 
would go up without long and strenuous effort.

Clouds move across the sky from east to west any time there are clouds 
in the sky.

Drop a weapon and it points north.

Of course its hard to get oriented in a woods zone when that wolf you 
were trading blows with gets the better of you and you need to beat feet 
to the nearest exit... but it -was- possible under better visibility 
conditions.

Splendid
