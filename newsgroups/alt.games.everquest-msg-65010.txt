Hi Fellow Gamers...

Just wanted you to put some thought into getting a good gaming headset.

My tops for this month is the Plantronics DSP-500

Take a look at it here:
http://www.plantronics.com/computer/dsp500.html

MSRP is $139.95

I'm selling it for $119.00

Yes, it's a lot of money, but this thing is loaded and has amazing sound. 
Again, check out the link.  If you want one, you MUST contact me directly as
this is a semi-secret sale and not found on our website.  Email me or call me.

I have lower priced options as well.  Bottom line, if you want to sound great
and hear the game with such vibrant sound you need a headset.  Kids, have mom or
dad call me or email.  Check out our website, we're legit.  We're the largest
headset distributor in Canada.  I am a US sales rep.
