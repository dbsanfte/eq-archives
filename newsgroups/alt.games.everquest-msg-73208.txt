Once upon a time that was probably true. These days, following all the
investors wising up about the immediate value of the Internet, the web
banners cover just a tiny fraction of costs, if comments I've read are
any indication.

EQTraders must have a tremendous hit rate if bandwidth costs are much
of a concern. Unlike many sites that request donations, EQT has pretty
tight HTML code - very little fluff there (most sites are terribly
coded, with 30-50% waste sometimes). Plus, her message bases (where
presumably most of her traffic occurs) is hosted by EZBoards.

I really think she's trying to recoup some of her time, rather than
her expenses. Personally, no problem with that at all - I know how
much work maintaining such a site is.

I only do it because I'm too stupid to stop :)
