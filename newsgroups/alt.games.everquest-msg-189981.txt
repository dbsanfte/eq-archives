My bard is only 35 but I've been duoing with a Shaman for the last few
levels.
Works great.  Shaman slow + Bard slow = sissy mob.  I can tank the mob
while the Shaman dots/slows.  Constant pulls with Shaman only having
to greater heal me every 3 or 4 mobs.  Plus, it usually isn't hard to
find groups as both Shaman and Bard are desired group classes.

But, Bard can pretty much group with anything.  That is the true
advantage of the bard.  You should let her play what she wants (so she
will like the game) and have your bard adjust tactics.
