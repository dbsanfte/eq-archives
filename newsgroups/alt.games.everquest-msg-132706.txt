Other than saying, "gee, I have the same motheboard and ram and a slightly 
slower AMD CPU and it works for me", I don't have much help to offer... 
I'm using win98 instead of XP because I'm just funny that way, and a 
Geforce 3 Ti500 and a cheapass soundcard.

}Enchanter with almost 250 jewelry skill making, and 36 Iksar Monk? BTW 
}The Necro has close to 20k pp.

Doh! And that just removes any motivation I had to help ya get it 
working...

Can I have your stuff?
