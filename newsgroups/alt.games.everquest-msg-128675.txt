There isn't a balance problem.  Clerics are better healers
and wanted because of that.  Shaman can negate the advantage
clerics get by casting spells that increase damage output
while reducing damage input.  Druids can negate the advantage
by casting spells that increase damage output.  That's why
they're balanced *now.*

Why do you think they're not?  Are clerics not balanced since
they have slower travel than other priests?  After all, the
other priest classes can both SoW.  Clerics should be able to
as well, right?
