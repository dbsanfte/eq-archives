Disagree.  If someone has no need for a no drop then greed does not even
come into it, does it?  How can there be greed when you can't sell it?
Unless you think that it is greedy for a bard to want a charisma aug over a
chanter?  Both can use it.  Some would say that it is more valuable for the
chanter, but I say if both want it then both roll for it.
