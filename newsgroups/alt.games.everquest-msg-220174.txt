It should'nt, that is why i said ...'and difficulty...'

One word: Loot.

Dungeons should have much better loot. Dungeons should require groups.
Also dungeons should have harder mobs and thus more exp. The zone itself
should not have an exp modifier. Each mob should be given an exp value
based on its level and difficulty.

For instance we know that a level 60 trash mob is not the same as a level
60 named loot dropping mob. Yet they both give the same exp based on level
and the ZEM. Why? Doesn't make any sense to me. The named should give
much higher exp due to its difficulty.

I disagree. Those people like me who would like to just exp and get modest
loot
would avoid the crowds and seek hunting in remote places.

As I said the mobs should have their exp based on their difficulty.
