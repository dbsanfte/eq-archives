You are doing something very wrong then. It's GREAT, but requires 2 
things to make it so:

1. Turn off the Height Filter (button on the right side).
2. Download and install all the maps from http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/

I am VERY familiar with every zone I currently run in and I still bring 
up the maps for navigating all the time just because they are so nice and 
convenient.
