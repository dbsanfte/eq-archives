Sorry, no.   I'd be suprised if your paladin can actually.   Have you actually
got 201 bind wound?

For warriors, the pre-50 skill cap for bind wounds is 175.   Beginning at
level 51, that cap increases 5 points per level.

Level 51 cap 180
Level 52 cap 185
Level 53 cap 190
Level 54 cap 195
Level 55 cap 200
Level 56 cap 205
Level 57 - 60, cap 210

Not until level 56 can the warrior bind to 70.

Actually that doesn't sound right, as I remember it being 57 as well.
Perhaps the pre 50 cap is 170.
