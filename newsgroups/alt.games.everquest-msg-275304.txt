I am not arguing for change of their expansion strategy. I am arguing 
for change of their revamp program... or more precisely I am arguing 
that they should actually have a real revamp program.

You asked the question "which effort provides a *better* return on 
investment..."

Its a false dilemma. They can do *both*.

There is no need to change the expansion strategy to add a revamp 
strategy.
