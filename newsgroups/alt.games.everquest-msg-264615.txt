No, any Scout can simply Disarm an unopened chest where it sits.

Every group leader has the option of setting up how loot works. You can set 
up a Free for All, where the first person to loot wins, or you can set up a 
Lotto, where as soon as anyone opens the chest everyone is presented with a 
dialog box and a 60 second timer, with a button for Accept and Decline. If 
you Accept, you get entered into the Lotto; if you Decline, you are out. Of 
those who Accepted, one player wins the Lotto and is automatically awarded 
the contents of the chest, it goes right into their inventory. If there are 
multiple items in the chest, they each get distributed independently at 
random to the participants. The default group behavior for your groups can 
be set in your options (most players choose the Lotto).

By popular demand, /random was recently added back in, so you could do that 
too if you wanted to, or if someone unintentionally missed the Lotto. For 
example, if someone dies during battle they cannot participate in the Lotto 
(dumb, eh?) so members either have to wait till they are rezzed before 
anyone attempts to open the chest, do a /random after the fact to 
redistribute the loot, or just screw over the guy who missed participating. 
If you hit ESC while the Lotto window is up and you haven't Accepted, you 
will also miss it. If the item in the chest is LORE and you already have one 
in the bank or in inventory, you won't even be allowed to Accept, unless 
there's also some other item in the chest that does not have that problem.

You can force open a chest (and suffer the trap) or wait till it's Disarmed 
before trying to open it. Either way, as soon as someone tries to open the 
chest by double-clicking it, the previously determined loot option occurs.
