I use Mozilla - www.mozilla.org. The latest version of Mozilla at the 
moment is 1.0 RC3. If you don't know what mozilla is, its the core part 
of Netscape made open source and almost totally rewritten. Mozilla has 
many great features as a web browser, email client, newsreader and even 
IRC client and HTML editor. There are many features of Mozilla which I 
can't do without anymore, such as tabbed browsing, the ability to 
prevent opening unrequested automatic javascript windows, the 
configurability of it (including the option to automatically reply at 
the top or bottom of a post, as you had asked about) and the array of 
skins for the suite. Unfortunately, it requires a bit more setting up 
than Netscape 6/7, since it needs Java and other plugins such as Flash 
and Realplayer to be installed seperately.

Netscape 7 was just released in beta last week and its based on Mozilla 
1.0 RC2, so it includes all the Mozilla features I have mentioned above. 
Netscape 7 comes with Java, Realplayer, Winamp, and Flash amongst other 
plugins which are optionally installed. Get it from 
http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/7/default.jsp

By the way don't let Netscape 6.0 put you off Netscape, since that was a 
VERY buggy and unstable version of Mozilla a few years ago. It has 
improved substantially since then.

Give either of these a go and you will find you'll never want to go back 
to using Outlook Express or Internet Explorer again!
