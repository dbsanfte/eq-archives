To Tame a Land
Find this song on Sheet music, CD
(Harris)
He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow.

He rules the sandworms and the Fremen
In the land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow.

He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
On the land called planet Dune.

Bodywater is your life
Anfd without in you would die
On the desert the planet Dune.

Without a stillsuit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis.

It is a land that's rich in spice
The sandriders and the `mice'
That they call the `Muad' Dib'.

He is the Kwizatz Haderach.
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar.

He has the power to forsee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars.

The time will come for him
to lay claim his crown,
And then the foe yes
they'll be cut down,
You'll see he'll be the
best that there's been,
Messiah supreme
true leader of men,
And when the time
for judgement's at hand,
Don't fret he's strong
and he'll make a stand,
Against evil the fire
that spreads through the land,
He has the power
to make it all end.
