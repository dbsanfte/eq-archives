Lessee, filaments, coal, eolith tempers, sandpaper, stroma wash, and on, and
on, and on.  As fast as I get money it flows away into supplies to allow me
to grind goods.  Unfortunately, the goods I'm grinding won't sell to players
(anybody want 140 pristine tin bars?), so I just sell them to the merchant
and cycle the cash through more materials.

At this moment, when I logged off last night, I had 13 CP to my name on one
character, and 1 SP, 60 CP on the other.
