Well, look at the atrocities throughout history done in the name of
Christianity.  Yeah, anyone who wants to do something like that and wants
people to still follow them is likely to call on religion to back themselves
up.  I don't advocate genocide simply because *some* Muslims deserve to die,
any more than I would because some Christians or Buddhists or pagans or
whatever deserve to die.  No reasonable person would.  But terrorists need
to be dead not because of their religion but because of what they do.  You
can justify anything with religion (or any other philosophy for that matter)
if you really want to.  This whole international scene after 9/11 has
absolutely nothing to do with religion, much as some people on both sides
would like to think it does.
