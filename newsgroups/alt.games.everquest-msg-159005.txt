Hello =)

What ISP do you use?

Been playing EQ for ages on cable...been great...

But now, I got troubles  =/    I moved to a place way out in the
countryside, and the best line I could get installed is ISDN.  Sooo,  no
more lovely speedy connection, and left with the horrible task of finding a
decent ISP.  They all seem to have a 2hr cut-off on their unlimited use
connections for 56k and isdn users..  all except AOL..and ick.. they are
horrid, lag lag lag, so can anyone else give me an idea of a decent
provider, anytime usage with no disconnect after 2 hours?

Sorry its kinda off topic, but I am at a loss... and aint got enough hair to
afford to pull any out =P

Here's hoping ...
