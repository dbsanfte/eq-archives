I've got a lvl 8 Ranger and I recently took the boat from BB to Freeport.
There is an island stop on the way and I was wondering if it is a higher lvl
hunting ground or should I explore. I only ask because once accidentally
stepped into a high lvl hunting area and was KOS by a big baddie there. Any
help much needed. Thanks.
