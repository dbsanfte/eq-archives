Hello,

I have been considering buying a manastone and was looking for advice
from someone whom has used one to see if they are worth it. I have
access to a druid whom can cast cloro on me and was looking to get it
to level up a Druid or Wizard of my own. Also looking for opinions on
that, I do like to solo alot.

I am aware that it only works in the old world but I can level upto 50
in the old world anyway. Also does anyone know how much they go for?

I play on Xegony.

Thank You,
