People in our guild and in a separate forum have been doing a zone time
vs. hardware discussion and analysis. This also fits in with what I've
been seeing/reading. My processor is no great shakes (P3-600) and my
wifes is even a smidge older (P3-500), but we outzone a lot of others by
huge margins. I checked my logs this morning through Joe D.'s parser,
and my zoneing average the last couple of days on two characters over
all continents except Vellious (haven't happned to go there recently)
has been twelve seconds. I have friends with faster *NON* pentium
processors who are averaging over a minute. Something weird is happening
that Pentium processors seem able to handle, but others like the K6 are
just gagging on.
