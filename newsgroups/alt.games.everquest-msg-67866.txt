Will do.  It will be a while, though.  Our Guild is made up of people that 
really haven't grouped together much at all.  We bend over backwards to 
help each other any time it is needed, but we haven't actually played 
together much.

Playing my chanter and recently my warrior, I have been assuming group 
leader responsibility most of the time, and will probably do the same when 
we do this.  I know it isn't much of a "Raid" per se, but it will be a 
decent test of whether or not this group of people can pay attention, do 
what the leader says, follow a pre-conceived system, etc.

There's also the problem of finding that tank.  I know a guy who will do it 
for the fun of it, but he is level 54, now.  My Rogue / Warrior - husband / 
wife combo friends would be interested if I can catch them on.  We'll see.

I'm still reading everything I can on that part of Cazic and the AoF in 
particular.  I don't want this first foray to be an ugly TPW because of a 
lack of planning.
