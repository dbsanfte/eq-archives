1 or 2 years IS a future!  LOL

If EQ does last for 2 more years it will have had a life span of
more than 5 years, which is phenomenally good for any computer
game.  Yes, it will eventually fold, and we will lose all the
characters which we have nurtured for so long, but there will
be new and even more wonderful worlds to conquer.  So who really
cares?

Oh, and by the way, there's life in the old dog yet:

excerpted from  http://eq.castersrealm.com/

"EVERQUEST GOING TO MAC-LAND
We just received word from Sony that EverQuest will be
released for Apple Macintosh's running Max OS X in Spring of 2003.
Sony Online Entertainment has apparently been working since January
of 2002 to get their products Macintosh compatible.  ...

In the Spring of 2003, Mac users can purchase the original EverQuest
and the top-selling expansion packs including: The Shadows of Luclin�,
The Ruins of Kunark� and The Scars of Velious�."

So quit bitching and keep playing!  ;-)
