Hi. I have yet to play the game, but I have friends that have convinced me
to start playing. Got the game, and have been flipping through the rule
book. Is it just me, or does the magic system seem a little simpler than
Asherons Call? I was thinking before of taking a Human Monk just so I would
have (what seems like) a simple character to get used to playing with, but
if the magic system does not go as far into needing to combine components to
make a spell, I might be willing to try a spellcaster of some type. Boils
down to what would you all suggest as a good character class / race to play
to get used to the game?

Thanks,
BIZKeT
