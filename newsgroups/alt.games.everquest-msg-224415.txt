Not 100% sure but I'm pretty sure an incoming cure removes the first
DoT it comes to and the 'extra' counters disappear so you'll need a
minimum of 2 casts no matter what.

The DoT will run full term even with 1 counter left.  Back in 1999
when I was levelling up for the first time I would log on with Rabies
and log off hours later STILL with Rabies.  Damn mummies.
