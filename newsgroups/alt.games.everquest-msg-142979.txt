The problem with this logic is easily seen by looking at the druid.

A big part of what the druid brings to the table is the port.   Being
able to gather a group together and get close to the destination
saves a lot of time, and time is exp.  So you'd think they would be
a welcome member of any group, if not a required one.  But they
aren't.  Why? Because its a simple matter to get a port from someone
not in your group.  You don't need them there for the actual exp,
just a couple minutes of their time, which you can easily pay for.
Same option with wizards.  The porting part of their job isn't
generally considered an important contribution.

Necromancers make an even clearer parallel.  Some places, death
means a long and agonizing CR... or a quick simple necromancer
extraction, at some expense to be sure, but the speed with which
this puts you back at work grinding means you get a good deal
more exp than you might have otherwise.  So, include necro in
your group?   No need to, hire one when you need his help, pay
some cash (or goodwill) and save all that exp you would have had
to "pay" him to have him in group.

OK, all these classes can make other contributions, but for that
matter so can a cleric.  My point is that rez isn't really a reason
to include a cleric in your group in a lot of places, where its
easy enough to drag your body to a willing cleric you aren't
groupped with.  At very high levels, the "willing cleric" population
goes way up as they start getting epics, so there's not even
any mana expenditure to consider.

Now just as including that druid means a lot easier faster port
capability, a cleric means easier faster more reliable rez... but
the cleric still has to be able to pull his weight in other important
ways.
