Heya!
As your characters are getting to the point where the zone has become easy
for you, start to explore the adjacent zones to the newbie zone that you are
in.
Like the newbie zones these zones have been designed for slightly better
than newbie characters. They will add the element of risk with higher level
mobs in areas of the zone that would kill you very easily, but also have the
rewards of areas with lots of nice blue cons for you to reap experience
from. In the non newbie areas you will notice more types of mob will assist
their fellow monsters so look out for this.
There are usually guards interspersed through these zones so that you can
hunt in fair safety.
Remember where you are bound so that you can return to the zone easily,
explore the zone and become familiar with it whilst avoiding the higher
level areas altogether.
Expect to die alot, until level 6 or 7 you don't lose experience for dying,
so don't worry about that. You will die every now and then. Try not to
wander too far away from your bind spot so you don't have far to run to get
your stuff back. Once you get to level 7 you will be proficient enough to
avoid death more often and so it wont be as frequent.

As far as spells go, get them all. You may not use them now, but in the
future you might. Granted there are some spells that you wont use till later
levels but buy them anyway for consistency so you don't have to come back
and get them later. The lower level spells are cheap too so if you save your
money you will be able to afford them all. Once you have your new spells go
to the newbie area and test them on green cons to see what they do and how
they work, with less risk of you dying.

I cant give you any specific advice about your characters as I don't play
them, but half the fun is discovering it yourself.
Have fun and happy hunting!
