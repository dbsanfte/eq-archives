There are two places that you can turn off spell effects, the old spell
effects and the new spell effects.  Both have to be done to completely get
rid of them.

/showspell off, which you've already found.

The other one is in the "new" interface...  I can't describe it exactly, but
I can try to lead you to it.   It is in the options menu, in the display
portion.  Spell particles, and a drop down box for high, medium, low and
off.   Switch them to off.  (or alternately, turn the "opacity" slider right
below the box to 0%)
