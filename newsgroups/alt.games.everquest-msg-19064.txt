From the 7/3/2001 computer section of the San Diego "Union Tribune":

====================

Alter egos
Screen names mix truth and fantasy

By Kathryn Balint
Staff Writer

Who would have thought so many people wanted to be God?

The folks in San Diego who run Sony's EverQuest online role-playing
game know first hand.

"God," it turns out, is one of their most-requested online, or screen,
names.

So is "Devil."  And "Beelzebub," if you can believe it.

"Some people have delusions of grandeur," said lead game master Gary
Mathews.

But why not?  On the Internet, you can be anyone you want.  Can't you?

[snip]

But in the cyber world of EverQuest, the online, subscription-based
role-playing game, it's one place where a name lives on forever, even
if the player doesn't.  The nearly 400,000 registered users of
EverQuest have created more than 7 million characters.

Once an online character is created and named on one of EverQuest's 40
servers, or virtual worlds, no one else can ever take that name on
that particular server.

Many Web sites and ISPs have policies that ban the use of obscene,
racist, sexual or trademarked names, but EverQuest has one of the
strictest policies.  Screen names must fit in with the fantasy setting
of the game.

"We don't want a bunch of Hercules or Conans or other characters from
extremely popular media running around in EverQuest," said Mathews,
the lead game master who is in charge of enforcing the game's naming
policy.

Under the policy, you won't see God, Devil or Beelzebub inhabiting the
virtual worlds of EverQuest either.  Those particular names are also
banned.

That doesn't stop determined players from trying.

Sometimes a player slips in a banned name by using creative spelling.
In those cases, Sony employees ask the players to change the names.
There are about 1,000 names that EverQuest's computers filter
automatically and reject.

Those identity-challenged players can always get a computer-generated
name.  But many players prefer to come up with their own.  It's a way
for them to try on Net identities completely opposite their true
selves.

"A lot of people that I've talked with are actually nowhere near in
real life what their character is in the game," Mathews said.

"People do this a lot because they have a desire to be somebody they
aren't, and when they get in the game, they find they can be this
person without any of the ramifications or responsibilities that they
would have in real life."
