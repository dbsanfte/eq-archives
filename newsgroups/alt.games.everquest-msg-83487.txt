And you know this, personally I don't care...as long as the server stay up
(and they do) and I keep enjoying the game I don't really care who works for
the company...what, you think that Verant's staff was the best at what they
did and irreplacable? Riight.

Hmmm I am not investing any money in Verant or SOE...the only return I get
is enjoyment for the game I get to play, I PAY for that...I don't expect a
financial return when I no longer return.

Last post from me, as you just seem to be trolling
