Have you ever had a conversation with your self.... as of yet you are
the only one on your side....   and your calling other people
ignoramus?

lol, you are the one who feels that getting a pet fixed (broken), is a
bad resolution to an overpopulation problem, but then you feel it is
fine for a animal to reject an offspring and a human sit by and let it
starve?  You would prefer the animals to reject their young for
population control rather than just removing the chance of the pet
having offspring?   Do you really even read what you are writing?

do tell, it appears you are a person of the world, and there is no
subject that can escape your grand knowledge.  So, please do tell how
the mighty faned knows all?  so far all you have done is taken a
superior stance to anyone who does not agree with you, and then
attempt to brow beat them into submission.    Do you ever give way?
Do you ever realize that there are other sides to the fence... how
bout realize that the world is full of two way streets, and no they
are not all designed and created for the soul purpose of Faned.

I think I get it... your pet died, due to the fact you got brow beat
by your woman....  I must say I am sorry for the death of your pet.
But you are so engrossed in your own self pitty and misery that you
cannot see the bigger picture.  
Figure out what in life you need to blame for your pets death... your
weak mind that crumbled to your girlfriend? your girlfriend for
proving how weak you really are? your pet for dieing on you?  how bout
shit happens...   now get on with your life and realize one event in
your life shouldnt decide all for your future......

Responsible people get their pets fixed if they do not intend / want
to have more offspring.   You call it lazy and convienant.  You can
put what ever title you want on it....  the reality is, you are bitter
about a decision you made, and feel all others should do the same as
you, because you KNOW better.   OMG you are starting to make me think
of you ina parallel of the Holy Roller who wants to save my soul,
because I havent found God the way they have pre perscribed.


Reality is... you feel we are wrong... and we know you are wrong...
