	Yesterday in Sky, I was without a healer for almost all of isle 4 (don't
ask), so I used Archery.  With very few LOS issues (because the mobs are all
flying, so they're above the throng), with Endless Quiver/AM 2/60% item haste
(Swiftwind/Fleeting; no spell haste)/ice acrylia arrows and a Compound
Steelshaft bow, I peaked at about 40 DPS.  I melee for 55-60 self-buffed.  (We
had a low 50s Ranger who used Archery the whole time she was up there; I
imagine she did about as much damage as she would have had she not been there
at all.)
