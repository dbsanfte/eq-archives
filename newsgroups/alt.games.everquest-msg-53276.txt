Greetings,
Does anyone know where I can get a list of required components for various
druid spells?  I know you need a bat wing to levitate and it's consumed when
you do the spell, and that you need a fish scale to cast the enduring breath
spell, and that you need a fire beetle eye to cast some of the early fire
spells...what else is there?  And is the spell component consumed when you
cast the spell?

Does anyone know of a list of them on the net?

Thank you.

Cousin Raven
