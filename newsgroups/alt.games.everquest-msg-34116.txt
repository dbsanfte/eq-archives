Surely, your definition of fun differs from mine.  Why do you play?

I won't dispute the fact that you were in the right -- the EULA is hardly
difficult to understand.  But the obvious pleasure you take in persecuting
other players is hardly difficult to understand, either.

Also, you claim elsewhere in this thread that the number of responses
denotes a particular level of 'interest'.  While that may be true, it is
hardly a guarantee.  I take it more as a comment on the overall nature of
this NG, and the lack of truly relevant material.  That, coupled with
perhaps a few bored players at work and the natural tendency of usenet users
to be argumentative ... but, I've been wrong before.  C'est la vie. (sp?)

I'm glad you're having fun, Lokari.  Its just a shame your fun has to be at
the expense of others instead of actually playing the game.
