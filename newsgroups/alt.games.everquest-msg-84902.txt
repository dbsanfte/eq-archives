If its FFA loot there is no such courtesy expected. People are
expected to loot their fair share, thats it.

I hate people who have split on because its mostly just silver and
copper, which I destroy anyways. I always have split off, always will.
So does most everyone else I group with. Monks hate it, pullers hate
it, low strength characters who need their AC hate it.

Racist piece of shit.
