If people need a healer you could probably find a group at 24 with greater
heal, of course higher=more mana=better. Whether you get xp or not will be
another matter. Not sure id bother with RM as a cleric tho. Its usually very
overcamped, so youll be sitting around waiting for spawns most of the time.
Just bide your time till 49, and then leave the auction channel on, for
money (rezzes)
