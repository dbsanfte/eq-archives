Actually, you might be surprised.  If nothing else, using a debugger 
changes timing of the execution generally speaking.

I have used a wide variety of equipment to observe and debug behavior of 
systems, and in each and every case, the act of observation does actually 
have an effect on the system.  Hooking up scope probes causes electrical 
changes.  Using an emulator causes minor, but measurable timing changes, 
and, at times, unexplainable changes in the behavior of the system.  
Using a debugger on code running on a PC slows down the execution of said 
code.
