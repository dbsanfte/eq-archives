Oh oh, its a "bad thing".

In which case, why on earth would it increase movement anyway?  I think 
there's a bard song that does this; fear plus increase movement, which 
would be one way to get rid of mobs.  But since this one doesn't seem to 
  have a fear component, why would the people being hit with it mind 
moving faster?

At any rate, I doubt anyone will care that it doesn't increase their 
movement anymore, particularly not since its only a 10% bump; are there 
any people doing POTime that don't have Run 3?
