Not exactly a quest, but once you reach level 51, you can start
funnelling some of your exp into the "Alternate Advancement" pool,
gaining points which you can use to "buy" permanent increases
in your WIS (and a lot of other stats/abilities as well).

Hit the "v" key while in the game, it'll pop up your
"Alternate Advancement Window", where you can browse all
the AA options available to you.  You can still see this
screen (but not use it) if you're below level 51.  But I
believe you have to have the Luclin expansion enabled
for it to be available at all.

The Luclin AA will allow you to increase your base WIS
by +10 points.  The Planes of Power AA will allow you to
increase your base WIS by another +20 points (4 WIS
for each level past level 60).

Other than the AA system, there is no way to permanently
increase your base stats.
