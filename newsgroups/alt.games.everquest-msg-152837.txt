Well, your problem might lie in that MMX is a kind of CPU, and not a kind of 
ram or video card memory... :) You might mean MX video card, in which case, 
as the other poster said, it's kind of cheesy, but should still be good 
enough.  Or you might mean MB in both cases, in which case your machine is 
uber.

That looks pretty good.  What kind of motherboard is it, though?  

I've heard a fair number of people diss XP.  Of course, they're usually 
followed up to by ardent XP enthusiasts...  Personally, I think XP looks like 
the operating system designed for a speak'n'spell, with all the big googly 
colorful round buttons and stuff, but that's just opinion. :)

But just based on the spec, that hardware should be fine.  Probably time to 
break out the manuals and start twiddling with things.
