what are you hiding if you don't want people to see what you are wearing?

This is not the equivalent of looking inside your underwear. Verant, I
suspect added this option because they could not add the facility to show
everything you are wearing on the main character models.

Inspecting someone is exactly what you do everytime you look at someone IRL.

The last time someone inspected me they then commented that I didn't have
any TWINKed gear, and game me magical boots and sleeves.

I dont inspect people that often, but occationally I see someone who has
obviously gone to a great deal of effort to get a full suit of matching
armour etc. In that case it would be rude not to inspect them. It is a way
of showing that you are interested in them, and showing recognition for the
amount of time it must have taken to reach that level. It would be much
ruder to interrupt them, to ask if you could look at their armour quietly
for a few seconds.

Equally, if they wanted to talk to me while I was showing a passive interest
in them then great, I am always looking for tips from experienced players.

On my characters, I tend to add a message to others inspecting me to say
hello if they are looking at my gear. I have no problem with explaining how
I got the stuff I have, if it then helps another player along.

If Verant gave the option to turn off kill stealing, excessive /ooc or
/shout spamming, or dieing then that I would turn off, but inspecting is
really not a big issue.

Maybe when the next upgrade comes out the charater models will be detailed
enough that some one will be able to see what you are wearing without
needing to inspect.
