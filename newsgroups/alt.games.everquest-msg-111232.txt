 If you discount all other factors, /random is a rather fair way to do
things. However,to discount all other factors would be a disservice to
your guildmembers. If I've been at the last 20 raids and someone else
has just joined and this is their first, can you say it's fair to do a
random? If so I'm sure glad you're not an officer in my guild. Actually,
my last guild was like that with loot awards and they lost a lot of
people. Am I a loot whore? No. But I believe if you put in the effort
you should get the reward. /ran does not award the dedicated members.

 If you don't think your officers are fair with loot awards either bring
it up and see what they say or find another guild. However, I'd be very
surprised if you could find any high-level guild that does the majority
of their awards any other way besides Officer decision.
