Oh, I make no apologies for Sony, I merely understand where they're
coming from; proper testing costs resources: money, time, extra test
systems, man-hours, etc. It's simply more economic to let the end user
find the bugs.

As for this, Windows 98, like Windows 95 and 3.x, is no longer a
supported OS. As such, they are no longer obligated to continue support
for it. If anything, I'd wager their developers license requires they
implement the latest and greatest DirectX version, which deliberately
breaks backward compatability with MS OSes no longer under support.
Please upgrade to XP for now, then Vista once it is released next year.

If I were to hazard a guess, I'd say they have this internal quick-test
server they use. It may or may not consist of a different box for
client and server, and is most likely not identical to the live
servers. It may have been at one point, but internal users tweaked it
beyond recognition and no one who has any real power on these matters
is aware of this. I base this on personal experience back when I did
programming.

Precisely, so why bother if it won't make any difference to them?
