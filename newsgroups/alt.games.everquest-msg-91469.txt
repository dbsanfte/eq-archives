That's bullshit. 'the regulars' here bash and slam Verant all the time.
But when they deserve it. Its obvious if you have been around a while.
They slam the idiots that post pointless rants and useless whining.
Especially when they state some obvious bullshit and exaggeration.

For me, I like EQ but I am not in love with it. Show me something better
and you can color me gone from EQ faster than greased shit through a goose.
Until then STFU and play the game or quit and leave this ng to people that
play.
