It's apparently the "proportional combination" part that's the royal
bitch. Granted, if you die and *know* you can't get a rez now, but you
can tomorrow morning, log off immediately (I mean log <entirely> off the
account) and log in twenty hours later, you should be fine if you get a
rez immediately. Also, if you just stay online looking and get it inside
three hours, also all is well.

It's that combination thing that I think would give most of us a
migrane. I mean if you spend one hour looking for a rez, and don't find
one, how much of your "offline time" of 24 hours have you used up? I'm
thinking it's one third. (i.e. by spending one hour online looking,
you've used up eight hours of your offline time already, and now only
have sixteen offline hours left.) So then, if you log back in eight
hours (offline) later, you've used up *two* of your online hours, and
you best find a rez in the next hour or you are.......
