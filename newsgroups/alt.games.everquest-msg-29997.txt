Because of the good/evil city thing? I did get your meaning the first
time.

Which is easily done. I'm sure there are people even more unfamiliar
with Faydwer than with West Antonica, for that matter.

No, it's a function of the Qeynos area being a backwater (which,
admittedly, is because of the WK run) where many people can't be
bothered hanging around.

As for people not knowing landmarks, not everyone prints maps of every
zone or memorizes the location of places they've visited once. Ever
been to SK and seen the shouts for loc of spires/treants/KFC?
