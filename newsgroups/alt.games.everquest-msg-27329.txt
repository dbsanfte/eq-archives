Sounds like you were grouped with one of those rare birds...a true newbie.
I think had you told him what a shaman's role is in a group while still
grouped with him he may have calmed down.

"I can either buff, debuff and heal, or I can melee...not both.  Which would
you prefer I do?"

Considering some of the responses I've already seen to your post I think
it's obvious that people forget that there are true newbies joining every
day.  There are thousands of people who don't know that bards and enchanters
are amazingly strong classes or that if you're holding 2 weapons and you're
a barbarian, you CANNOT cast SoW.
