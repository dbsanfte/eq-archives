It was verified with showeq a long time ago. When calculating the exp
for a mob, the level is squared and multiplied by a zone constant. If
I recall correctly it was 100 for newbie zones, 80 for dungeons, and
75 for outdoor zones. As a result, a level 20 mob in LoIO is worth
40,000 exp, the same level mob in OT would be worth 30,000 exp.
