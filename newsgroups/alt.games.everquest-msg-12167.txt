Holly has already fallen to my blades on a few occasions (went back for her
when I hit 30) there is a Mcmanus that runs thru QH, don't remember his name
but he has suffered the same fate. Someone actually killed  (permanantly)
Cros Treewind so I never got my shot at him.

Slate, of course. I have taken him but with a necro friend as partner (who
could have solo'd him anyway) and I have helped when he's been pulled to
tunnel
and now, the named Treant in NK but I have a feeling he may be only slightly
shy of 60, so he may have to wait.

No one else, I have been killed by other NPC's (halfling druids at the rings
in Misty but that was me not paying attn to Camo dropping, I well knew what
the score was when I entered there)
