 If such things don't matter then it doesn't matter what I did to
them. No rules, no problem. There are unspoken rules within the player
community and regardless of my right to be there they broke them. You
ask if someone was there before you especially in a 'hot spot' like
the TR. Otherwise you better head to the zone.

 Then in theory I could have hit the whole are with a AOE and called
the GM that they were KSing me right?

 Then the game erupts in chaos with no one respecting anyones 'rights'
to camp an area. Do you have any idea how many people come into CB,
ask if the TR is camped and eitehr leave or find another place to
camp. And based on there being no rights for a drop then KS'ing
wouldn't exist. You have no right to the mob your beating on so anyone
else can come in and take it if they got the firepower. Simple huh?

 Ah yes, and insulting those whose actions yuo don't agree with is
real mature. Whats that word the they use on here... on yeah
