Well the request page still has a lot of people asking for access... id
estimate a hundred or two have been given access to the forums (not a mod,
so thats just a guess)

Why the hostility about it anyway?  Its not an elite board where people rub
each others egos... its just a board where we'd rather talk about the finer
points of EQ and monkly issues, without the morons noobs and idiots that
inherit boards such as monkly-business.

We don't want to talk about the finer points of "is a human or iksar
better"..  and if that means the entry requirements are steep (end game zone
access is required for board entry) then so be it.  How dare us elitists not
let lower era/playtime monks into it, OMG were such elitist bastards for
limiting entry to only the people at the level of the game that we care to
discuss =(
