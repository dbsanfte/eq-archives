I'm a noob - some dark elf neut decided it would be cute to repeatedly
provoke me to kill her with my dark elf necro.  I didn't understand the
faction thing; she intended to lower my faction and baited me into it;
somehow, it was probably fulfilling for her.  Bla!

How do I improve faction in this game?  Is there some quest I can do several
times in Neriak, or something I can kill?
