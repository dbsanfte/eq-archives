I'm pretty sure I've only petitioned once.  I can't think of any others but
I was pleased with that one time and I never even heard from a GM or Guide.

I was playing in SK with my wife.  We were grouped killing birds and
elephants.  Some kid, I'll assume he was a kid, was being generally
obnoxious in ooc.  Several people had asked him to shut but he wouldn't.  I
don't put people on /ignore and I've never turned off a channel, the chatter
just doesn't annoy me that much.

Anyway, he got into a pissing contest with a female.  She slammed him, quite
humerously, a few times, so starts calling her a bitch, whore, cunt, etc.  I
did a tell to him and said I was hunting with my wife and even if they're
aren't any kids logged on, my wife would prefer not to hear it.  He ignored
me and kept on.  My wife did a tell to him asking him to please stop, it was
really bothering her.  He told her, then tell the stupid bitch to shutup.

If I could have crawled through the line and slapped the piss out of him, I
would have.  Instead I scrolled up to the cursing and /reported.  I then
petitioned and explained the situation.  It wasn't 5 minutes before there
was no more chatter and a /who showed he was no longer in the zone.  I
credit that to a guide/GM although he may have just logged.  Seemed awfully
coincidental though.

I remember I did petition one other time.  A level 30 something necro parked
his skellie on the orc camp in misty thicket to get faction for over 24
hours.  I petitioned then and it took about a half hour but the skellie went
away.

All in all, I've been happy with the support.

Lewis
