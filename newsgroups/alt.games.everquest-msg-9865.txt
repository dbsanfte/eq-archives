hmm... 

Pros of an Erudite Cleric Class

1:  You look really spiffy in your armor.

Cons of an Erudite Cleric Class

1:  You're blind as a bat

2:  You're kinda weak to carry around all that heavy plate stuff.

3:  Unless you're gonna live your entire life in Odus, chances are
most vendors will glower at you.

4:  Trolls and Ogres will often mistake your huge, oversized, bald
head for a tasty candied snack.
