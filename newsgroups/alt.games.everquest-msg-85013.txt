I agree that you will not see much difference until you hit 50. There the
regen really kicks up but there is where the exp penality kills you. One of
the guides on Monkly-business.com breaks down the difference. I got a iksar
to about 15 then started a human monk, manily for the faction. Most people I
play with are "good" races so TP and getting together are easiest. In the
end though play which one you think is coolest, because if you don't you
will never play him and then all this makes no difference. Regen/Hand to
Hand don't matter because of the spells/equipment you can get, espically
with all the hand to hand gear dropping on luclin for monks and
beastmasters. So as with all classes pick the race you enjoy and your
equipment will cover any difference
