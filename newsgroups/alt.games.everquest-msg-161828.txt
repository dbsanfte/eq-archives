Even at 175 it will fail - just very rarely.

I'm not 175 in smithing quite yet, but at 138 and with a gearlock I fail on
metal bits about 1-2% of the time. Same for HQ Metal Rings. I've done
hundreds and hundreds of both.

Basically, being way, way above trivial and using a gearlock, the math works
our to something like 98% success rate. Personally, I feel that this is a
little low from a realism standpoint (I don't think a Grandmaster Smith
should fail but on perhaps 1 metal bit combine in 1000). There's always that
2%.
