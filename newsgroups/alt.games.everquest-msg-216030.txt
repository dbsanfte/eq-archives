Never actually collected hard data (would have to make up hotkeys
announcing each spell as it was cast, would annoy the hell out of
group to create that much spam I think), but it sure seems to me
as if heals in particular and beneficial spells in general (like
the buff "heals" Clerics and Paladins cast) are _much_ easier to
channel than detrimental spells.  It seems like a mob rarely
interrupts even a slow casting heal unless it gets a lucky bash
in, while my fast casting stuns are interrupted with annoying
frequency by most any unslowed mob.  With my Druids, I've several
times channeled Lesser Succor thru a beating as well as quite a
few heals, but snare and root often take several tries to get
them timed right to avoid interruption.

just my $.02
