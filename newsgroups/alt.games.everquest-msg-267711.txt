I left the isle of refuge pretty bored with fishing. I couldn't seem to sell
anything i found and while it was vaguely amusing to shuffle after the
fishies, i wasn't as keen as in eq1. I presume that if you set up a market
you can sell some of the low level harvesting ingredients but I'm not sure I
could be bothered, as I gather from this 'group that i have to sit about
doing nothing while i sell?

In eq1, i didn't really have a problem having a vendor dedicated to this,
but i don't intend to buy a second account again especially just to sell
things. Since the upgrade, my pc generates a ton of heat (always reminds me
of battletech; I need more heatsinks dammit!) so I'm not real happy with
leaving it on overnight, especially during this hot weather in Sydney.

Anyway, i thought i might as well fish while waiting to heal up after a
battle, so at the Crossroads i started fishing only to be told my skills
weren't up to the task. There doesn't seem to be any fish actually in
freeport to practise on? I presume the waters' too polluted? If you leave
the newbie isle without getting 40 in harvesting skills, does that mean you
are locked out from improving the skills?


Eski,
Antonia Bayle,
and loving it.

p.s. quests in eq2 are awesome fun even if mostly involve running about
looking for people ;-)
