Karnors Castle is an outdoor zone.

All NPCs have an awareness range.  Harmony reduces this awareness
range significantly (to 0 or 1).  A harmonied NPC will not notice
anything that happens outside if it's now reduced awareness range.

This means that if you cast on a gaggle of critters, and pull one in
the back, and this NPC passes directly over the harmonied critter, the
2nd critter will agro.

I have only seen one case where harmony didn't work at all.  The DEs
in Kithicor that you have to kill for the Rogue ragebringer quest seem
immune to the effects.  I don't think its based on mob level or type,
just those particular mobs are hard coded to not be affected by it to
stop the ragebringer quest from being easier than it already is.
