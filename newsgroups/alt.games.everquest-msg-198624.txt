Thanks for the info, the link you have above doesn't seem to work for
me, says it's too old, but I'll search the board tonight to see if I
can find it. 

If I understand this correctly, the lower the charisma of the tank,
the better? Damn, and I finally thought my charisma buffs might have
been useful! <g>

I wasn't thinking of using it for every fight, or even the majority of
fights, for that matter. More along the lines of using them for things
like the mini's in PoS, named in BoT, unslowable mobs in CoD...,
places we'll hunt, often with an seriously underequiped MT for his
lvl.
