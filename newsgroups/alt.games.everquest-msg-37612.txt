I would try doing a thorough file check from the patch program. If that
doesn't work, delete those files which seem to have problems from the
above log, they may be corrupt. So delete GEquip3.s3d and
Global6_chr.s3d from your Everquest directory and let the patch program
download fresh copies.

If that doesn't work, maybe the files are OK, but whatever it is they
are there for is screwed up somehow. Lets suppose *.s3d are sound files
(I'm sure someone here will tell us what they actually are) - if that
were the case, maybe EQ can't load them into memory because your sound
support is all fouled up, in which case I'd try reinstalling sound
drivers, maybe Direct X (always reinstall sound and video drivers
*after* installing Direct X), checking your sound card isn't sharing an
ICQ with anything important (make sure its not on the same ICQ as your
video card or network card for example), etc.
