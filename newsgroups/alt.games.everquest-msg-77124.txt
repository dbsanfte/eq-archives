Yeah ... kind of like the games goes on, but my computer got lost in
mid-thought.  Even with the textures set down a bit, it still happens.
I still am having some fairly odd latency issues, too.

If I recall correctly, the size of the cluster is dependent on the
size of the drive.   It's not a static number based on the format.  I
haven't played with Spinrite in a few years, but back in the OLD days
that's how us geezers tuned drive performance.  I do remember back
when a 256 byte cluser was your target, and if you could get it to 8
byte ... well ... crown that man King Geek.
