I've played Everquest for a couple of years now.  I have a 200 MMX 128MB RAM
and a 16MB Voodoo Lilith Banshee card.  (You can tell that I am not one of
those that has a great deal of time to spend in Norrath...Dalavidu is the
same character I started with.)

I did get the Kunark expansion, but never went in there more than once or
twice because of lag.

Except for that, I've never had a problem at all.  None, zilch.

I'm still playing as I have after all the new patches etc.  A bit of
tweaking the options was required (no MIP Mapping seemed the most critical).

I will not purchase the new expansion, but that *has* lit a fire under me to
buy a new system.  My rule of thumb has always been 'don't bother upgrading
as long as your computer does what you want it to do'.  Well, now's the time
to finally get a new system I think.

I'm not sure, and I'm not a tech, but I suspect that the MMX might be
important.  Who knows.

Just my two coppers worth.
