I had a magic sword, wondered if it would deal with a will-o-wisp in
Qeynos Hills.

Kicking, of course, had no affect.  Good thing my character had
temperance, as my 'toon took around 100 hit points while my 'toon
dealt about 2 hit points over the combat. Both by using the rock
throw ability gained in the tutorial. The sword missed, over and
over. I was usig my 6th level barbarian warrior. I zoned out.

Get a few levels, and increase my attack, and I should hit with the
sword.

I checked http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=134 and
I see it does require magic items to hit one and they are sociable.

Any suggestions on what to combat one with ?

Thanks,
JimP.
