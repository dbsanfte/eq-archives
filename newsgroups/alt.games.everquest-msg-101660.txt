Yep I agree, I was asked last night by a friend making a monk twink where to
put picks, and I said as many as you can into Sta.

Im not sure the last few (I think you have maybe 5 left after maxing STA)
really matter.. strength would probably be my next target, but STR is so
easy to get up anyway

60 human monk, my STR is 20 or so points higher then my stam (tho I guess it
doesn't matter for me anymore, as soon as avater procs, and with my spirit
of ox pant buff it all maxes anyway)

A guildie 60 monk put something like 15 picks into WIS when he first started
(keke) and he does fine.. its nice to have a little boost, but ultimately,
do starting stats really make much difference?
