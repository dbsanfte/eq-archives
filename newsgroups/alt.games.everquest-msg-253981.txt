Question was from a 43 CLERIC where to solo.

Answer:
Another thing you might want to consider is The Great Divide; I really
learned and perfected my soloing there.  You can root and then nuke a
monster, and if you figure out how the range of your nuke spells
works, you should be able to root, back away, nuke, and then re-root
when the root breaks before your enemy can close the distance to you.
This works particularly well against the shardwurms, because you can
pull them out the north entrance of the shardwurm cave...

...because they have a breath attack,giant range melee,much hps
for their level,warp like mad  and are generally undercons? :)

I dont know,sometimes crap like this make me laugh,sometimes
it lets me doubt on my fellow players.
