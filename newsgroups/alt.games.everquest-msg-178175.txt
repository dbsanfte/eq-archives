    Much more than half is down. All tier one, two, and three planes have
been defeated. In tier four (elemental), fire and air have been cleared
including final boss. Earth A has been cleared, although it's buggy and
flags haven't been given out for some rings. Earth B, to the best of my
knowledge, hasn't been entered. Water A has been cleared to the Corinav
event, which is just being worked on now. Water B hasn't been entered. Time
A/B haven't been entered, but from the AoE's that just went up on Lucy it's
just being populated and tested by the developers now. So safe to say that
70%+ of the expansion is down, with a month and a half left to go on my
prediction for Time being entered. Stall, devs, stall! ;-)

    RZ is a gateway mob, in that you cannot access any elemental planes
without killing him and you will usually have all content before him dead
when you try him. He also has elemental-like loot (the masks, etc. off
Rallos are as good as the drops off nameds in the elemental planes), which
is not true of the gods you kill before him. At this point the mob I'd most
compare him to would be Emperor in Ssra. He guards access to the "serious"
content, he has loot equal to that of the areas he guards, defeating him
requires significant strategic thought. Just like how guilds in VT will also
kill Emperor for upgrades, we kill RZ for upgrades. Especially the Blade of
War - it's an amazing weapon.

    Wait until the elemental planes. We are surprised when chain pieces
drop, although the drop rates might have been fiddled with last patch (jury
is still out). Most of the drops we see are leather, to the point that our
bard pullers have "Inc -< Boss_Name >- F LEATHER" raid pull messages. We
already have multiple leather folks with multiple elemental pieces, whereas
there's a large number of chain and plate folk who have yet to get their
first drop.
