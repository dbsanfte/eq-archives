Hey, I haven't even had channel ownership in months :)

I'm supposed to take a game break starting next week - I'll be
spending the summer with my sweetie, whose computer is miles from
being EQ-able; but I do expect to be using EQIM to loiter around
channels from time to time :)

(Ok, if this stomach/chest thing is too bad, I won't go. We're ruled
out heart, liver, lungs, but I'm still sick. They're gonna shove a
camera down my throat on monday, yay.)
