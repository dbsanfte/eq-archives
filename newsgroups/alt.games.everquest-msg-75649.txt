Just so you don't come straight for my throat, here's a little
story about what preceeded this, showing my stupidity and all.

I wiped Befallen with a level 30 necro and his level
39 wizzie friend, to get a dagger of marnek for the necro.

We got one, on the second thraumathurgists spawn in a row,
and we also had this thraumathurgists robe, which I looted to
see how it looked on me. Then I rolled about the robe with
the wizzie, and I rolled a '1' - go figure.

I gave him the robe, and shortly after first the wizzie then the necro
logged. I happened to have a look into my inventory, and
went like "WTF? Why do I still wear the thraumathurgists robe?".
Turns out I accidentally gave the wizzie my Advisor Robe. DOH!

If I see him online next time and he won't trade it back, I am really
gonna get pissed - but that's a different story.

Anyways, I decided I needed a new robe, went to OOT and killed
Oracle of Al Kabor with ease (For some reason I could single pull
his guardian before).

As long as I was there anyways, I went to have a look at the AC camp,
and found it to be a) empty and b) with no mob spawned.

Decided to sit down and entertain myself a little, getting some xp
on the cyclopses and maybe - well, you know the addiction.

5 minutes later - pop - an ancient cyclops.
This went soo fast that I didn't even have time to get excited
over another ring of the ancients :)

On top of the island there still was a cyclops corpse which wasn't
even cold yet. My predecessor on the camp would probably bite
his fingertips off if he knew the AC spawned right after he/she
abandoned camp.

Ah well, kinda some kind of pay off for all the times I have
camped the AC successless... :)

Best Regards,
