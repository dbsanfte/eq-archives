Yes, that was the formula for working out DPS of a weapon before taking into
account other factors, like damage bonus and attack rating.
This was used on the MaxEQ site to compare weapons.
Now that your damage bonus is displayed when you inspect a weapon you can
get a better idea what it will do in your primary hand but this will not
actually give you the maximum damage of that weapon, there are other factors
that I have no idea how to calculate. Nor will it tell you what your actual
DPS is, you really need that to be parsed.

I still use this formula when looking at a prospective upgrade.
