If there were any serious bugs... who would notice? :)
Have seen anywhere between 3 and 6 barterers up (usually four) on Saryrn.

I do agree with your theory about they always inteded to do this,
though. Explains the nigh-identical zones, and the two separate trader
portals.

Next patch, I expect they'll announce you can be both a trader and a
barterer at the same time, once they've worked out what happens when you
right-click on someone set up as both. I get the feeling whoever wrote
the Bazaar code is long gone from the company, and others are afraid to
mess with it directly.
