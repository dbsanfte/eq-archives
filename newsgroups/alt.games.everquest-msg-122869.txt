>I want to go from Faydark to the Warrens......

Since you have Luclin, here is how you do it.

1. Go the the Spire in Greater Fey and Hail the Nexus Scion. (The
Scion will give you some details)

2. Say to the Scion "I with to journey to Luclin". The scion will hand
you a portal shard, that you have to have in your inventory to make
the trip. The shard will vanish when you port up to the Nexus.

3. Sit and wait. The scion will shout out a countdown till the portal
fires....5 mins...3...2...1..."The portal is about to become active"
(Ports are 15mins apart)

4. Once in the Nexus you will find yourself standing in the middle of
a large chamger. There are four large tunnels around the chamber. Each
tunnel leads to teleportation pad that takes you to a different place
on Norrath (Antonica-North Karana, Kunark-Dreadlands, Faydwer-Greater
Fey, Odus-Toxxilia Forest/Velious-Great Divide)

5. Find the Odus/Velious Scions and teleportation pad. This is the one
pad that is "shared". Don't stand on the teleport pad until you know
for sure that the next port is to Odus.

6. You want to take the port down to Odus NOT Velious. You will have
to listen carefully to the announcements by the Scions, so that you
make sure and take the right port. You can usually ask the other
people wating there which port will fire next. (Ports are 8 minutes
apart and alternate. So you will have to wait @15minutes if you miss
the Odus port)

7. Once in Toxxilia Forest (that is where the Odus port takes you)
head SSW until you see the cave/opening in the moutain wall. The
entrance looks like a patio made out of marble. run through the cave
to zone into Paineel.

8. Once in Paineel turn left (do NOT fall down the hole, follow the
ledge) Camo yourself and run out into the newbie area past the
Skeleton guards. Go up and over the hill ahead of you and you will see
a cave. Inside the cave is the "pool room". You can bind here. 

9. From the "pool room" you will see a smaller cave leading down. This
is the zone to the Warrens.

Go to www.eqatlas.com and look at the maps to the zones I mentioned
above. The maps are easy to follow.

If you have a spare character slot, create an evil Erudite (Necro or
SK), and explore the route from the Paineel zone in to the Warrens.
