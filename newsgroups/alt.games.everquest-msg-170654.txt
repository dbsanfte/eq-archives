SK/Shaman- haste slow snare dots pets (albiet weak ones) healing. What more
do you want?
SK/Cleric- no explanation needed.
SK/Druid- Go anywhere, anytime. Ports. Nice LONG snares. Lots of dots.
Harmony in the early levels, Feign Death later. Heals.
Mage/Necro--- lots of nukes, dots, taps, good pets, the mage has slow mana
regen, but two pets dual wielding sword of runes in The hole is ... most
impressive. twin pets fear kiting is also great fun.
Necro/Necro (most dot's stack now, but do you really want to start another
necro though?)
Paladin/Enchanter (very overlooked combo). Heals, slow, haste, good
protection, mez, charm.
Enchanter/Cleric: cleric keeps enchanter alive while enchanter charms.
Cleric eliminates the down time of charm soloing in a dungeon (where the xp
flows like water).
Wizard/Druid  Friends that Quad together, stick together. fear kiting
animals with a nuking wizard is fun. Nowhere you can't go.
