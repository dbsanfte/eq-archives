Ask Brad - August, 2, 2001

Q:  "Currently, yes, we do plan on turning the Trivial Loot Code on for
all Luclin zones on all  servers. Keep in mind that Luclin will have
zones for levels 1-60, and we hope the Trivial Code will allow us to put
some pretty enticing and powerful items in the lower and mid level zones
without fear that some higher level players will bottom feed there."
What you are saying here is that for those of us with high-level
characters, much of
Luclin will be wasted space.

A:  Well, yes and no. You're still welcome to go there, but if you're
too high level for a given area, you won't be able to loot most treasure
from the NPCs there. I'm sorry
you feel this makes the space 'wasted' for you, but often lower and mid
level
players feel zones that were designed for them are somewhat wasted when
higher level players are there monopolizing the area at no risk to
themselves.

Q:  Content with trivial combat code might as well not exist for us,
because we have no reason to go there.

A:  That is the point, yes

Q:  And no, we're not going to start new characters to go there. We
didn't fight our way into the 50s just so we could go back to looking at
our spellbooks for another 35 levels.
What's the point of making an expansion with a huge KEEP OUT sign on it?

-- Venture, Outrider, E'ci

A:   While you and I'm sure some others might not want to make another
character,
we do know a few things:

1. There are still a LOT of players who are in the low to mid levels
with their first
characters.

2. There are a LOT of players who have multiple characters they play
concurrently, often at all different levels, from low to mid to high.

3. There are a LOT of players who want to start a new Vah Shir Beastlord
(or any
other class, for that matter) and enjoy the content designed for them
without fear
of high-level players interfering with that enjoyment.

I'm sorry if this is frustrating or unappealing to you, but in the end,
we think
implementing the Trivial Loot Code in Luclin will make EverQuest a
better game
overall.
