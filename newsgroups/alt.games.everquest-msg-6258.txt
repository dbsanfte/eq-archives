Got some friends that want to go to the Warrens and Kerra Isle.
What's the route for "evil" people?  Catacombs through Qeynos, then...
Swim in front of the boat to get on it?  And then stay on the far side
of the boat while it's at Wisp Island?  After this I'm lost.  How does
one get through Erudin?

Also, who all of the following will be able to sell in Paineel:
Ogre SK
Ogre Shaman
Troll Shaman

Thanks in advance!
