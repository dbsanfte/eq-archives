I died twice last night as a result of the entire mob aggroing on me after a
single heal on our tanks.

I can't sit there when there is 3+ monsters bashing our main assist around.
My roots only last seconds,
and when broken just increase the odds of them coming after me.

Can any more experienced clerics offer some advice on what to do when:
a) avoiding the aggro all-together, and
b) what to do when it does happen to (hopefully) avoid a quick death.

Thanks in advance!
