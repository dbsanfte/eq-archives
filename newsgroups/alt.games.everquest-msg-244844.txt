But we've all heard of cases where people did not get away with it for 
those actions.

This particular case has *no* known precedent I'm aware of...That 
doesn't make it legal... but it makes any argument that it is illegal 
exist in a vacuum of case law...and arguing on the letter of the law 
that was not even written remotely with what you are proposing in mind 
is ... weak. At best.
