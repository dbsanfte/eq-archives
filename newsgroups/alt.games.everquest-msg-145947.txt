Well, if all they wanted was socializing, EQ would be a chat
room.  Sort of like The Realm.  ;-)

But seriously, in RP terms solo play is important in helping
suspension of disbelief.  In more understandable terms, if
it's plausible to postulate a 'Robin Hood and His Merry Band'
style of play then it's also valid that there be lone assassins
plying their trade.  If Verant were truly interested in creating
and maintaining a realistic setting then solo play would just as
welcome as group play.  After all, it's not like solo hunters
aren't interacting with everyone else, because they really are
in many important ways.  There *should* be room for all styles.
I've never understood Verant's obvious bias against this.
