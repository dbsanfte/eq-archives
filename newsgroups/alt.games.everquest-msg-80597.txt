    That's the mature way of going about it. Doesn't stop folks from raging
on immaturely when other names get taken out. I mean, here's a list of
players whose names I know were changed by GMs (the old names): Hits
Hardest, Havusin Maweena, Heywood Jablowme, Chikkin Chunks, Pigsvommit Onu,
Madej Thewhite, Theworden Ofundead, Ffat Azzbasturd. Half of them couldn't
see why their names were changed, and thought it was cruel and unfair.

    It would be nice if names were written to a file that GMs could access
during slow times. Have the name file only be written to when a character
performs a successful /surname, have it write full first and last name, and
have GMs have the ability to remove a name from the list if it is within the
naming policy. Bet you'd catch the offenders a LOT faster this way, well
before there's emotional attachment to the full name.
