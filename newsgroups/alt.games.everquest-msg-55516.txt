Myself lvl 51 druid and 2 friends wiz 43 and war 44 zoned into Rathe
from Ferrott and seen bodies all over. Ok things might have changed here
i told group. Checked track and all was green. Nuts. Three others asked
to join us and we had full group and decided to go to tower with the
large scarabs type mobs when i seen a blue on track. Yep you guessed it
the Blood Reaver. Our group was all casters except the war. BR was 100%
magic resistant. In seconds all but 1 of group was splattered about and
very dead. By time i got back to Rathe from bind spot in Thuragin almost
all of the 90+ that had been in zone was now dead. Later that night i
found out where we went wrong. We should have had 2-3 groups of mainly
tanks and a healer and enc. Where magic fails melee takes it to its
knees rather fast. Only bad part is the ae and range of it doing i
believe 500+ dmg.
