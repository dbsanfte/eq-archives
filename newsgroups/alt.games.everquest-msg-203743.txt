Bah!  Have you even less imagination than I?  The whole post was
tongue-in-cheek (rather obviously, I thought).  Besides, even among
you powergamers I have seen no clear agreement as to what is and is
not "zerg".  How many people do you bring to your raids?  More than
18?  more than 36?  more than 6?  more than 72?  what is "zerg" and
what is not "zerg"?  how many deaths do you take fighting big bad
boss mobs?  how many of the dead are raised and rejoin the fight?
how many are raised multiple times during the fight?  where can I
find the "official" definition of this word "zerg"?

This word, "zerg".  Is it inconceivable that the definition implied
in my tongue-in-cheek rant is just as correct as the too secret to
share definition you hold so dear?

Oh yeah!  Major League fun, eh?  Big-time roleplay there!  Run around
and around and around and around and around doing exactly the same
thing over and over and over and over again with no risk whatsoever.
What chills!  What thrills!  What excitement!  The brave knight errant
ventures forth into the wide world to face unknown dangers and right
wrongs! (Or was it the cowardly finger twitcher sneaks about invisibly
over paths so well known that he could walk them in his sleep in order
to do some shopping for an NPC).  Quest, schmest.  If that's what you
think makes for great (or good, or even half-adequate) solo play then
we have even less in common than I thought.  OTOH, if you're just trying
to give examples of non-raid content in prior expansions, thanks for
setting up another rant for me.

All of which (including that mindless POS "quest for casters with Invis
and Gate, fuck the rest of you poor schmucks" I already gave my opinion
of) is neither here nor there, not in any way relevant to my rip of the
pathetic whining that LDoN will "hurt their guild".'

I don't have an opinion on LoY yet, except the generic complaint that
it's really fucking lame to tie interface changes to upgrades.  If
they did without that crutch their content designers would have to
produce more good quality new stuff instead of relabeled old crap in
order to get people to buy.

[/em calming down a bit]
As I said above, I was responding to the second-hand whine that LDoN
will "hurt their guild" (yes, that's right, I responded to a rumor
with a rant, didn't even bother to follow the link, so sue me).  I'll
not deny that my tendency to respond to whining with a rant makes me
a tad predictable.  But the mere fact my rant this time was tongue-in-
cheek doesn't give you the right to attempt to usurp my unofficial and
self-proclaimed position as "Mr. Literal" here in a.g.e.  :-p
