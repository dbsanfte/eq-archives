I think the fact that EverQuest has several classes that are good
at soloing proves that SOE wants monthly fees from soloers as well
as groupers.  Bards, Wizards, Druids, Mages, Necros, Beastlords...
At various times I've heard all these described as excellent solo
classes.  And I'm probably forgetting a few.

That doesn't mean your theories are wrong.  It's probably true that
SOE wants networks of friends to form to keep people in the game in
order to keep those subscription fees coming in.  But I think there
is no question SOE is also interested in catering to the soloing
segment of the player base as well.  This means SOE must also cater
to the soloers to some degree.

The big question is: what is the ratio of soloers to groupers?  At
best I think we can only guess at the ratio.  But I think soloers
make up a non-trivial portion of the player base, especially if
you include part-time soloers in that group.
