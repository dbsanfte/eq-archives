Well, first off, last I checked wolf form didn't help in Unrest at all 
anymore.  They nerfed illusions about a year ago so that all non-player 
illusions had no effect on con.  Which was retarded, don't get me started.

** Illusions/Shape Change **

We have changed the way that Illusions and Shape Changes work with respect 
to faction.  The new system is a lot easier to understand than the old 
one, so we'll just explain the new one.  When changed into the form of a
playable race, characters are treated as if they were a member of that 
race.  When changed into a non-playable race, characters retain their own 
racial factions.

The only way I can think of you'd be indiff to undead in estate of unrest 
is if (a) you had IVU up, which would be reasonable for a cleric, or (b)  
you conned that one zombie girl from down under the gazebo who's for the 
bard epic.  Serra, yea, that's it.
