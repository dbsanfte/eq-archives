Hey all,

I'd like to get some advice as to the best armor, weapon, shield and jewelry my
level 11 Barb Warrior should be wearing.  And I don't mean the best twinked
equipment.  I mean the best equipment my warrior can get on his own, through
combat or auctions, while mostly going solo (say about 99% of the time). 
Please be specific :)

TIA


- Markham
