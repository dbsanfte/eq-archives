There is a specific faction guide for your in game journal (Alt-N - brings
up the Notes window). I found this on EQInterface.com under the downloads
section for Story Windows. I would link to the file directly however you are
required to sign up at EQInterface.com (A really great web site IMO) before
you can access it, but it costs nothing and doesn't register you for any
junk mail or spam. It does contain alot of detailed faction information for
your perusal. IMO there are quite a few useful Note items here -
particularly the tradeskill related ones(they sure saved me alot of paper
from printouts hehe). To install the Documentation download the file and
extract it to your Storyline folder with the "use folder Names" box
checked - then you can acces this information at anytime in game. On the
note of Halas factions - they seem to be (besides Cabalis Faction of
course), one of the more difficult factions to raise through hunting
(Xenophobic Barbarians).

Good hunting to you!
