I believe that past versions of EQ haven't worked this way; in many 
cases the
fastest way to get a release of an expansion was to have someone in the 
States buy it and UPS it to you; this still would mean you wouldn't get 
it till at least the next day.

Why this should be I have no idea, since unlike say a Harry Potter book, 
you can't get any actual use out of the thing by getting it early; its 
not playable until the servers go live.  Retailers are -already- getting 
copies of the game, they just aren't allowed to sell them yet... 
although that also makes no sense, since again the game is useless 
without servers.

Product Launch protocol makes little rational sense.
