To what get these guys who aren't really doing anything wrong banned?
Players who are paying 13 bucks a month to just provide free buffs. I
don't see any value to clamping down there.

Or to make sure SOE is aware that these do exist and to prepare
themselves for the inevitable abuses? That I can see... but I still
wouldn't want to get some guy banned over the one non-abusive way to
use those tools.
