That's my whole point.  We tend to take advantage of our pets, using them as
a spell or a weapon rather than the acting groupmate they are.  Sending them
to fight, letting them take the damage while you deal damage from a safe
distance, leave them to die when you're in trouble...
...now not feeling bad about this, and actually enjoying it at times is a
whole different thought. =)
