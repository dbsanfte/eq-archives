Best thing about an invis that doesn't drop is that it doesn't drop.
So you can walk thru any zone that doesn't have see invis mobs,
pull bodies, check spawns, set up wherever you want... any time
I'm trying to do this sort of thing with regular invis on, I know
that at any moment I might be 3 seconds away from visible.  In
the sadly rare case of an all undead zone (say LGuk... most of
it undead and most of the rest not KOS to me) my non-fading
ITU is a wonder to behold.  Since undead free zones with
few and far between see invis mobs are much more common,
Non-fading Invis should be just as stupendous... and to my
with my bard alt, it is indeed.
