Gratz... I've been camping him out lately myself.  Unfortunately, as a Rog,
I got myself into the situation where I was healing from a previous cyclops
when he spawned.  I had to sit for a minute or two to get my HP back and as
I stood to reposition behind him, he despawned..... grrrr.  Back to the
grind of camping him.....
