First things to try, anyway:

*  Delete the Blackburrow files from your EQ directory, and run the
   Thorough File Check in the EQ Patcher.  (Just run the File Check to
   begin with, if the idea of deleting files scares you).

If still no joy, contact EQ tech support via:

It sounds like you died at some point after trying to log into BB, which
is why you ended up outside Halas (was this your bind point?).  Your corpse
will still be in Blackburrow somewhere, I suspect.
