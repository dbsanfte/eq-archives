I've decided that I can't play this game anymore. It's so depressing. Every
time I play EverQuest, all I can think about is slitting my wrists. My
doctor said that's bad, so I can't anymore.

Actually I've come to realize over the past few weeks wasted way too much of
my life on this game. When I look back at all the time I've spent playing
this game, months and years that I can't get back, that I could have spent
in the REAL world, with my REAL friends, it almost brings me to tears. I
hate this game so much now.

Also, in my opinion, EverQuest is getting way too easy. All the fucking
newbies can do anything in the game now, and zerg guilds always win. This
game is being dumbed down for retards like Sunslayer, and it makes me so
angry! I don't think VI cares about anything but profit. Fucking assholes.

Aside from this, don't have the energy to play EQ anymore because I'm dying
of a rare form of hand cancer, and between horribly painful treatments and
terrifying blackouts, I spend most of my time sleeping. Honestly it's not
much fun anyway with dickheads like Blueryder making fun of me and calling
me a liar all the time.

You should all know that I recently got a new job, and I don't have time to
play EQ anymore. When I'm not working, I'm usually too busy plotting how to
kill my bitch ex-wife... err... nevermind, I didn't say that.

Not to mention that everyone in my guild is so greedy. Just yesterday,
Redcure got a Super Death Sword of Invincible Doom, when she had just gotten
a Mask of Discontent Housewives a week earlier. Not to mention that
Lovebuilder ninja'd a Bracer of Infinite Goatse later that day.

Besides that, ever since my corpse rotted, the game hasn't been the same for
me. I can't stand to live without my items, and I just can't take it
anymore. Thanks a whole not Bluesmoke and his group for leaving me in the
Hole and refusing to help me get my corpse out, you fucking assholes. I hope
you burn in hell where your skin will be shaved off daily by horrible
demons.

I can't ever forget how much i hate that asshole Stonebear. Just yesterday,
he tried to pick a fight with me. He called my mother a slut, and then I
called him a fag. (I'm very clever, aren't I?) But then his friends Boneseer
and Earthbuilder joined in and started making fun of me. I thought they were
my friends, it really hurt my feelings.

Anyway that plays EQ is a loser. I can't believe that all of you retards
still play it. I guess you're all just jealous of my 22 inch rockstar cock
and 12 supermodel girlfriends that I fuck every day (all at the same time),
both of which I gained immediately after quitting everquest. You're all a
bunch of fucking sad losers. Especially Dreamcure. You really need to get a
life, buddy.

I hate this game. It's so unfair. I'm never, ever coming back, so fuck you
all. Especially Stoneslayer. Fuck you.

Love and kisses,
Graeme Faelban
