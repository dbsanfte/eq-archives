No. His info was not shared. Knowing the guy, it could probably be 
guessed with some educated brute force, or perhaps hacked indirectly... 
he was savvy enough about not responding to email password scams, and he 
didn't run hacks or cheat software... but he'd be the sort of guy to use 
the same password when creating an account on a guild-website for 
example... ie not paranoid enough.

As far as what happened... well, as I said... SOE never told him. So we 
have no idea what was done with the account to get it banned.
