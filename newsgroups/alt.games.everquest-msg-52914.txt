I think that while it would look appealing to many people, it would
certainly have drawbacks. You can use twinking to blow through the "rats
and bats" levels easily enough, but going much further than that could
be a disasterous. Example:  I've played a warrior into the fifties, and
a monk and a wizard into the mid twenties. I recently started playing a
necro from scratch, and actually thought that my time as a wizard would
give me a nice foundation of knowledge of how to play it. It's a totally
different experience. I'm picking it up as I go, but I've really been
clueless and it's been a heck of a learning curve (though really fun!).
Seeing how poorly I played the silly thing up to level seven (where
nothing really matters, not much to lose, etc.) I can't even *IMAGINE*
suddenly being thrust into the game as a 51 Necro having to either fight
high end, complex areas solo, or worse, trying to productively group
with experienced 50+ players. I'd likely get them all killed along with
myself in the process.
  Second example. While my wife was out of town once, a guildmate got
killed not far from where we had camped out before. Being of high enough
level to care (the victim, that is), and there not being any other "good
rez" capable clerics around, we decided that I would log on Tiru's high
level cleric, go take care of the "simple" rez for our guild brother,
then go camp her back out in a safe spot. I nearly got her character
killed, and really had no clue what the fuck I was doing. If any serious
fire fights had broken out at that point, I guarantee that I couldn't
have kept myself, nor the party alive, in a situation she would normally
see as trivial, keeping everyone productively going and probably finding
time to fix a snack while doing so.
  All the classes are different. Each has it's own skills and craft that
we pick up as we go. Letting folks suddenly switch over at a high level
from one class to another, and then go group with people, would be not
much better than the group suddenly finding out they were grouped in The
Hole with an e-bayer, IMO.
