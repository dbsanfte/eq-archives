To do Rak, don't use the mage pets, it's a waste of time, takes way too
long, and is an uncertain way of doing it anymore.  What you need is two
tanks, preferably 60+ (well, one tank, one damage dealer), both with high
FR, 200+ is good.  Get two to three CH casters for each of them.  Healers
stand outside of AoE range, and keep the tank and damage dealer alive (not
hard at all), the two melee Rak until he is dead.  We did it last time with
a 62 Ranger, 60 SK, 3 clerics, one shaman, and two druids.  There were a
number of other people there, but they were just there to help with clearing
out the rest of the mobs, and to grab and deal with any adds.  At the end of
the fight, I was at about 40% mana, clerics were 60%+, druids were at about
50%.  We way overhealed just to be safe, did a CH rotation actually, which
was really unnecessary.  Lowest I ever saw the Ranger get was about 80%
health.  I would be comfortable doing it again with one cleric for each of
the two melee, and one backup healer.

I did try the Mage pet route twice, both times it failed, first time to a
bug, second time due to adds as the fight was just taking way too long.
