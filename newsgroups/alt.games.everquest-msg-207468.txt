I don't know of any charming bard that would find a reason to group with an
enchanter. Maybe if he wanted his pet's hasted.
Admittedly though that doesn't meet your qualifications. They can group,
effectively (they should never have CC problems) but it's not a match made
in heaven.

Wizard/Rogue would be rough, the wizard would have to keep agro and agro
kite.
Enchanter/Rogue is easy if the rogue listens. (Mine didn't). Haste pet,
haste rogue. Pull with tash. Root, slow, DoT, step up, get hit, start color
stunning to stun lock, rogue moves in and backstabs while pet goes chop
chop.
