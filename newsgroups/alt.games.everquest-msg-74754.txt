Let's see, slow one mob, or haste all tanks, I wonder which takes more mana?
In group situations I have both loaded, and, if I'm not the primary healer,
I will keep tanks hasted.  I guess it depends where and with who you hunt.
I do find, that with a tank heavy group in xp grind, slow can be pretty
useless, as the blue mobs drop so fast.  But then, of course, DoTs are
useless then as well.  SoW is always maintained, usually by me, as I have a
cheap group SoW/ATK buff. I still find that I fight with melees that do not
have over 100 STA, so I do buff STA on them.  I usually buff Dex if someone
has a useful proc on their weapon as well.  When I solo, I do not have haste
or slow loaded, instead I load my two most powerful DoTs, and root and rot.
