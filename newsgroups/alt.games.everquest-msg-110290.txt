Ok, people, I am not saying that Everquest is anywhere near dead.  Hell, I
just signed up for two more years of it.  However, we all have to face the
fact that all good things must pass, and that eventually Everquest will die.

In those final months of the game I believe that we will see server
consolidations,  a marked decrease ( if that were possible ) in customer
service, and more server downtime as Verant's resources are diverted
elsewhere.  Then the end:  Doomsday.  One dark day when the plug is pulled
on the last remaining server.  (I shudder at the thought.)

I don't think that has to be the absolute end, though.  Many of us have home
networks, several with 3 or more PC's.  If Verant were wise, they could
squeeze a last large chunk of money out of us by producing a real version of
EtherQuest.  How many other die-hards would be willing to set up their own
server, for play by themselves and their friends?  The data files containing
our characters could be downloaded from Verant, and stored locally.  That
way, we wouldn't lose our characters.

Granted, there would be some kinks to work out, but I believe that it could
work.  Verant wouldn't have to  support it very long after release, just
long enough to help get the bugs out.

What are your thoughts on this possibility?
