Best bet is to get a SoW from a friendly Druid,Shammy or Ranger at the bank
and just run it as fast as you can. The spiders aggro range lessens as you
gain levels but just keep an eye out for them and avoid them. If one aggros
then run back to FV and the drixies will kill it or just keep running for
the LoIO zone. They arent too fast a critter and can be outrun.
