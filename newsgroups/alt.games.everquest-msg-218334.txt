Watching the mobs is the best way in my opinion.

First, /assist the tank, slow his mob.

If you are the only CC, wait until the tank has taken a few swings then just
get in there and manually target the next mob, if at 100%, it needs slowing,
slow it, park it, then go for the next.

It is usually pretty easy to tell a slowed mob from an unslowed one just by
watching them, the ones swinging faster need to be slowed :P

Of course it all depends on the space you have and the makeup of your group,
but generally as long as you get 'most' of the mobs slowed it shouldnt be
that bad.

It also depends on how many mobs you are talking about, and whether they all
have the same name etc.  In my experience, though, I just slow the tanks
target, then start slow parking the others, using manual targetting.
