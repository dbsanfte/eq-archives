Well, in my experince my xp from DL has stunk to high heaven, and I didn't
go there until 40. There seems to be plenty of stuff there that would be
interesting soloing though, but I did the first for 40's soloing in EW
instead (fewer hills in some areas, which allows you to avoid unwanted aggro
easier).

On my server, GD is spotty. There is usually a group at the giant fort, but
it often has higher ups that steal all the xp. DSP you can always find a
group in (several actually), but finding one of the right level to do well
xp wise is the challenge. At 40, I recommend a 40-45 group to do hoppers. As
was mentioned by the other poster, you should be able to start your own
group here since this spot can only be camped at this level by a group that
has a solid healer. Level wise, it is actually slightly higher when the
tribals have it than when the hoppers do in my experience.
