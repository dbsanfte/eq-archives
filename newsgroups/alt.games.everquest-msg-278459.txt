With pickup raids, usually luck is all that can make or break raid(s).
It's usually a good idea to plan raid ahead of time so more people
could come in but not all raids can be planned.  For example, some
raid mob are timed hours or days from the last kill or last server
reset and often pickup raid is the only way to guarantee such mobs.

Pickup raid or not, I often go if I have the time.  I've had many
wipes but it's for fun anyway :)
