But that's not what you said.
This is the message I was responding to (and you snipped):
<begin quote>
One of my webservers took 1700 hits from the new worm inside of twelve
hours.  My home DSL took several hundred.
Each hit is 16 HTTP GET requests, which means 16 TCP connections.
Personally, I'd rather that never got to my machine in the first place.
YMMV.
<end quote>
So where do you say you have one?  Seems like you were saying you have lots
of problems with hits.  I think you were trying to say that people should be
smart like you and get a hardware firewall, but at the same time you felt
the need to give proof it is necessary so you said that you were getting a
lot of problems with hits.  You can't really have it both ways.
