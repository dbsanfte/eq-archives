, I just spent under 32 dollars for a 256k pc133 chip from my local

     RD RAM PC 800 is $98 for 256, at the very cheapest any where in the San
Diego area, anyhow.  I have searched, called, read "sale" flyers for
approximately 20 different retail stores, both chain and private, including
Best Buy ($156 for 256), CompUSA ($198 for 256) Fry's ($109 for 256) and a
plethora of private stores too numerous to mention.  Even on line, you
cannot find it for less, I have been to many websites as well.  Keep in mind
this is RD RAM, PC 800, not any other kind, before anyone tells me that "Oh
yes, you can find it for $27" or whatever, because unless you can show me an
actual sales receipt with a UPC code that verifies the match, I will be hard
pressed to believe it. (Don't mean to sound rude, just have encountered too
many people who talk out their asses).

For some folks, upgrading for Luclin is NOT as cheap as some people make it
out to be.
