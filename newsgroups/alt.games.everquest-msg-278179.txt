Yeah, that one was my bad. The two servers I've spent any significant 
time on to date (FV and Saryrn) observed RFP as the common convention. I 
forget that there is a level of individuality among the various servers 
regarding protocols and standards.

Come to think of it, one of the people in that same group actually used 
the term "gtg", and I didn't pick up on it. I'm such a n00b...again. :P

It's kind of nice, actually, as long as I can avoid coming off like some 
kind of uninformed pompous jerk. Wish me luck there. ;)
