I have had far too much experience being on the receiving end from bigots.

If I get angry, I play in to their hands and end up giving credence to their lies about being unstable, violent and
undependable.

If I try to reason with them, I waste a great deal of energy that on the bigot, who often will ignore all reason, and
my dissertations end up passed over by those others I am trying to educate.

If I ignore them, then there is too often no one to speak out against the lies that the bigots are perpetrating.

If I laugh at them, I can ridicule their doctrines in a way that catches and keeps the attention of others who might
be taken in by their lies. I can undermine their claims with silly slapstick comebacks in such a way that bystanders
start laughing at them, too. The bigots get the attention they demand, just not the attention they were looking for,
and often end up slinking away. If we are lucky, they leave for good.
