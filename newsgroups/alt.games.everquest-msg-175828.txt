It depends on what you want to do.   If you eventually want to tank
boss mobs in high-level zones, you want a warrior.  If you just want
to play a tank up to 65 the other primary tank classes are fine.  This
is just my *opinion* but I'd suggest an SK.  The ability to snare and
fear kite goes a long way towards making it the most solo-capable
tank class.

(And, no, bards aren't tank classes.)
