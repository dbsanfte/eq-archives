Correct me if I'm wrong--you haven't used ANY of your training points?
If this is the case, you need to train one point in Taunt in order to
get that skill to go up (even though you get Taunt at level 1, you
still have to put a training point into it).  You also need to put one
training point in each new skill you get after level 1 in order for
those skills to go up (generally you only need to spend one point, as
the skills will go up on their own while fighting).  So if you're a
level 17 warrior, you should put one point in Bash, Dodge (both level
6), Parry (level 10), Dual Wield (level 13) and Double Attack (level
15).

Otherwise, if this isn't the case and you've already trained in those
skills, you can save up your training points if you want; maybe you'll
feel like starting up a trade and you can spend some of your points
there to speed up the process.
