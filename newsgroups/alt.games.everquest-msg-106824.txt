What's with some of you people putting shit on lawyers? Sure they will be
happy to take your money, but so is the guy who just served you your coffee
in the morning. Do you leave the shop muttering "Oh that barista is a prick,
he charged me for my coffee thismorning"?
I have never quite understood why some people feel the need to bad mouth ALL
lawyers. If you have a valid disliking of an individual for professional or
personal reasons then fine, but black listing all of them is ridiculous! I
used to go to a physio to fix my knee problems caused by snowboaring. I felt
the level of service was unacceptable for the cost so I went to a different
physio. I did not however conclude that all physiotherapists are useless
money hungry scavengers! Perhaps a topic best approached in alt.lawyers.anti
=)

Apologies for the digression, back to the topic. On one hand I agree that
one should be able to make real world earnings for their hard work in game,
however it does jeopardise the integrity of the game which is, in my
opinion, the most important concern (No this is not Gordan in disguise, I'm
not going to start talking about 'The Vision', hehe). I suppose twinking is
messing with the way EQ was *meant* to be played, but twinking is generally
done by people who have a high level character, or are friends with a high
level character (in which case they are given a guiding hand to learn the
ways of the game so that they aren't uber with no idea what to do with their
power). So for this reason, I don't have a problem with people buying items,
but I have a big problem with people buying accounts (that guying asking the
necro for a SOW to do a corpse run to "Burnt Woods" being a perfect
example).
There you go, pros and cons as I see them.
