Why would orcs (allied with the dark elves) make any less sense than
dark elves or trolls or ogres, who are all enemies of the "light"
races?  It's not like people don't kill members of player races,
e.g. dark elves kill halflings in Nektulos, dark elf guards in
Nektulos are, or used to be, popular victims, etc.

Undead would perhaps be more problematic, but if you can ally with a
necromancer whose goal is to foster hatred or disease, why not with a
vampire?
