Signature attribute of GoD trials, isn't it? Why they chose to revert to
corpse retrieval hell with this expansion is a mystery.

In anticipation of this I recently re-set my experience ratio to 90% AA, 10%
regular experience. I've built up around 3 yellow of cushion in this manner,
but I can see it's going to drop fast. I may go to 70 or 80 in order to get
ahead of the game. Right now I've got a corpse sitting at the zone line but
I don't think there will be anyone around to rez it for a long time, so
there goes a big chunk.

BTW, is the zone-in a GY or are the only graveyards those outside of the
instanced trial zones?
