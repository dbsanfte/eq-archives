Generally its good manners to do a camp check so you dont go and make yourself
unpopular.
Have seen a level 30+ guy in EC shout out to the zone that they guys at Orc 1 had
to leave now, since he was higher level and needed the faction, so now it was his
camp. Stuff like that dont make you popular.

Same with the Spider Cave in Guk, been there a lot since im a tailor, and usually
bring a low level meelee type for powerlevelling. Had a guy walk in with a low
level friend, and start taking spiders from the last room. Ask him politely to
honor general camp courtesy, then he start to insult me.
Since i could not really do anything about it, i just made a shout to warn the rest
of the zone about him trying to steal peoples camp.
Was REALLY happy when i saw him and his little friend running away from the spiders
2 min later, and his friend went down, since noone in the zone would help them.
Then he comes back 2 min after and try to pull the 2 spiders closest to entrance
(probable thinking that i would not notice it). Again i just ignore him and warn
the zone again. 2 min after i hear him shout for help again, and was delighted to
hear that his friend died again.
After that he didnt come back, probably realized that right there he had so low rep
in Guk that noone would help him.
