I've had friends go Linkdead and continue to fight back once they were
attacked.  We usually have to protect the person until they time out.

The odd thing is not that you guys managed to kill the super green
frogs/orcs... it's that the corpses didn't poof as soon as you did.    When
you are linkdead, for all intents and purposes, to the game, you are a NPC.
You cannot be healed by a player, or harmed.  If you get the killing blow on a
mob that players are fighting (or do over half the damage)  the corpse will
poof, same as if an NPC guard killed it.

It does happen that way, I've seen mobs go poof because a linkdead person got
the final blow...
