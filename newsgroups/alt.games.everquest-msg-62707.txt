This would never work your machine does not have a client file it is stored
in your computer memory. If you would like proof have a friend give you one
item and you do not give have anything in return at the instant just after
you hit trade reboot your computer when you log back on you won't have the
item and neither will your friend it is lost in limbo. Supposeedly there is
a Trade log that the GMs can check to see if you did infact trade or at
leaset thats what they told me when I Lost a Bone Bladed Claymore. BTW the
GM did replace the Claymore.
