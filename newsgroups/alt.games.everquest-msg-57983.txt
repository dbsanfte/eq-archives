It's a bug, don't count on it happening very often.

In general, you can only get instrument skill increases
(and/or instrument spell-effect boosts) if you actually have
the appropriate instrument in your secondary hand (and if
you're playing a song that is based on that instrument type).

If you don't have an instrument there, you are only
singing, and will get increases to the singing skill (and
no boost to the spell effect).

I have another bardly question:  Why do bard vendors sell
both mandolins and lutes, at different prices, even though
they are both stringed instruments and seem to have
indistinguishable effects and visuals?
