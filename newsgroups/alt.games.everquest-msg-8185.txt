All the Giant armour quest pieces drop off mobs in the Temple of
Veeshan. That would be the named Dragons ranging up to level 75. :)

Probably, you can multi-quest most quests with multiple pieces. There
are over 20 items you have to get in the Jagged Blade of War quest,
I'm sure many can be multiquested. However, in case you were thinking
it might be nice to have as a twink item, some parts cannot be
multiquested, such as the Ancient Blade from the Queen of Chardok. And
good luck getting either of the Dragon scales if your warrior didn't
help slay the beasts.

You multiquest by having different people turn in separate items. For
instance, in the Warrior Epic, you have to give Denken Strongpick 2
rebreathers, a block of permafrost, and a keg of vox tail ale.
Presumably I could turn in the rebreathers and permafrost, you could
then hand over the keg and he would reward you with the Ancient Sword
Blade.
