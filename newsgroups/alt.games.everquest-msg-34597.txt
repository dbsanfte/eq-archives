Who's all excited?  Feeling lonely that no one's talking to you?  I see now
where this is going and it really has nothing to do with decorum and what's
on topic here now does it Mr. Lonelyguy?

Unless perhaps someone lurking who shared a common interest with Jim and I
in hooking up together on a common server?  Perhaps some of the other UO
refugee's who've found their way here?  But of course you know everyone who
parses this group and as such, speak on their behalf.

I don't know how  much more we could be discussing the game seeing our
discussion involved what class Jim should make to make a good partner team
in EQ.  You're just spoiling for a fight and this is all you bring?  I think
I've given you too much credit.

Yup, definitely too much credit.

Really, if I want to really throw decorum to the wind and go nuts arranging
an EQ Fan gathering in this newsgroup I'll do it TwoHead - and if that
bothers you, don't read it or KF me.  I'll guarantee you after this sends,
I'm going to extend you the same courtesy.
