Go to ftp.linksys.com and get firmware version 1.39 (Jun 04, 2001)

I have been using the linksys 4 port since about that time and had similar
problems anytime I upgraded the firmware to anything above ver 1.39. It
lacks some of the more advanced features that the current firmware supports
and I have read that there are some security issues with it if remote
administration is enabled. 1.39 still supports mac address cloning, port
forwarding if needed and will probably solve your problem.

The details of the security issues regarding remote administration elude me
at the moment but I do know it is only an issue if remote administration is
enabled. I have never had a reason to configure the router from outside my
lan so disabled is not a problem.

I run 3 accounts simultaneously very frequently (mine and 2 kids) with no
problems using pretty much the default configuration and no port forwarding.
