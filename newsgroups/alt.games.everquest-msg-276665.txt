What of them? You make it sound like they're somehow entitled...

Consider Chess ... Gary Kasparov doesn't play in the same league as Joe 
Idiot who doesn't have time to learn the game, study it, practice it, 
and earn his rank in tournaments... still if Joe Idiot wants to compete 
he should be able to buy a ranking on ebay and play with the Tier 1 
players, right?

The very idea that just because they -want- to be the best that somehow 
entitles them to it is just pathetic.
