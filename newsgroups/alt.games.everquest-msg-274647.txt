I want the head of the people who tinks it was a good idea to bring
the server down every few days.  EQ1 servers are going down again, for
the 4th time in as many days.

This is a major inconvience as some mobs have spawn time longer than a
few days and with that in mind, some of my guildies have been
complaining about difficulity in doing their epics.
