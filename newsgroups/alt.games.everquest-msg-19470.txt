Killing bixies and goblins and orcs in Misty Thicket, just
watch out for the occassional rivervale guards in misty. 
Not sure if wolf form works to adjust faction here or not,
but if so you can get a wolf form from a nice druid (share
wolf form Lvl 39 spell) you can turn in Death fist belts to
one of the guards in Misty Thicket and raise faction that
way too.  http://everquest.allakhazam.com is an excellent
source for faction lists and quests/mobs to kill to raise
them.
