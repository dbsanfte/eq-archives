Wonderful idea, but what a shitful implementation. Offline trading would
have been much preferable.

best enhancement: new faster graphics engine.

2 worst "enhancements" were imo released with PoP.
1) levels 61+ having so much turning green. I dont want to level my chars
past 60. Total inspiration killer.
2)Raid's and Raid channels. Now I have to buy 2 expansions just to keep
raiding with my guild (for the next 12 months till eq2?). Screw that, and
screw buying eq2 if thats their idea of loyalty to their customers.

personally KEI has been a big game killer for me too. Many hours sitting
around doing nothing. Since it affects only 1 class tho, it doesnt quite
rate as bad as the two above.
