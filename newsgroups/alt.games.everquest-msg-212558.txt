Aoebe wants to twink herself up.  She's got about 10K a pop from
brewing the heady kiolas, and wants to replace most of the lower
level wisdom gear (+1 to +2 stuff) with more powerful stuff.

She needs to keep her fine Antique ring & Veil,  has an open earing slot
and the cap has been sold.  She has the imbued bracers for her deity,
Rodcet Nife, but is willing to entertain suggestions for better gear.

The general idea is to purchase some really nice stuff for the 24-45
level, save up, then make the cultural armor for her at 45.

So the first question is what would be nice gear for her besides the ring
and veil, and a budge of about 10K per slot.  Note that She may
end up flooding the HKoila market thus it may be less, but the
trading mule seems to always sell the kiola in a day or so.

The next question, Aoebe is heading back to PC for a level or two
more, then off to Mars Seru.  What's a good spot(s) for 30 to 45?

Regards,

Aeobe
