After an extended break from EQ, I grouped with a Paladin last night. We 
became separated during our travels and he told me to use the group map 
feature to find him. He said there would "X" on my map that would tell me 
where he was.  I didn't have it. We tried zoning into another zone, but I 
still didn't have anything on my map indicating what his location was; only 
the arrow that showed my location.

Is there something I need to do to activate this feature? Sounds like a very 
handy thing.

Thanks,

Harkendin
