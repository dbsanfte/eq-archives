I agree on this point. Honesty always works out best and having a
customer contact other people who you know can do nothing is simply a
bad PR move. Microsoft saw this recently with all the worms etc., and
are slowly starting to move in the right direction, Ballmer, in a recent
speech, mentioned this. Consumers are becoming tired of being bounced
around until they go away. Tell me you can do Sweet F All! That I can
respect!

Having said the above, get over it! I sympathize with what happened to
you, but if you had adventured more instead of taking Sony to task over
a trivial matter, how many points would you have achieved? Yes the GM
should have said straight out that you were hosed. Yes the GM should not
have directed you to customer service. This is a game! Not a life
changing event. Bugs will get fixed eventually, but move on.....
