Um, I snipped the rest of your post because I had no particular
disagreement with it, no attempt was made to "prove that my [your]
entire argument is fallacious".  As for whether or not you were
stating an opinion, you presented the particular opinion I responded
to as if it were an incontrovertible fact.  And how, pray tell, did
you expect people to read "Games ARE work" (emphasis YOURS) other
than as an alleged "hard and fast rule"?

It was clear from context that that is not the definition of the word
"work" under discussion.  Of course, that sort of thing hasn't stopped
other threads from going even further afield.

[obligatory smiley hinting at the absence of rancor:]  ;)
