    Chances are they'll do it like EQ and like they're planning on doing
SWG. They'll have phase 1 which is basically just internal people with very
few testers. Phase 2 is a few more testers, phase 3 is yet some more, and
phase 4 is when they test just how many people can jump in the game before
it breaks. Everyone who applied got into phase 4.
    I got in during phase 4 so I didn't get to experience the beta in its
very early stages so I can't comment on the other stuff. My system never was
screwed up by EQ though.
