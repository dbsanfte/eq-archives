Wonder if Verant has ever considered one of the following:

1] CD player ability through the client. Perhaps with a set of
commands such as:

/cd play [TRACK]
/cd stop
/cd repeat none
/cd repeat one
/cd repeat all
/cd order [TRACK] [TRACK] [TRACK] [TRACK] [TRACK]

Or something like that....

===========================================================

2] Allow you to associate CD tracks on your CDs with game situations.
For example, choose your own music tracks for:

-Out in the field
-Combat (various, maybe depending on where you're fighting, outside,
towns, or dungeons)
-In a town
-Merchant shopping
-Guild training
-Meditating (you never know, you might want something relaxing) ;)

Just a few ideas, in case anyone in Verant is looking... CDplayer is
nice, but you can't realy control what you're playing for music while
in the game. C'mon, guys! :)
