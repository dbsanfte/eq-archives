From Castersealm:
"Firstly, the new Raid Grouping system is not a free EverQuest feature. You 
will not be able to be part of a raiding group using the raid window 
feature unless you purchase the Planes of Power expansion."

How ridiculous is this? Will people use raid groups at all if some raiders 
can't participate? Does this mean everyone in the raid group needs POP, or 
just everyone that is a Raid Leader or Raid Group Leader?

This is pretty disappointing, Sony.
