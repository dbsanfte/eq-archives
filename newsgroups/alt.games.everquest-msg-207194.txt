Wish I could, but even though I can't I just don't think the current
system is all that effective. What ends up happening is that people
just don't go to places where CR would be a bitch. I used to hunt in
Dragon Necropolis a lot, but never without having a monk/sk/necro
around for the inevitable wipe (and I swear about half our trips there
ended in a wipe when some unstunnable [pre-PoP] roamer would gate and
bring down half the rat tunnels on us).  Same goes for SG to a lesser
extent, especially back when some of the mobs had a 500(?) point AoE
spell.
