Hi, 

And welcome to Bristlebane. 

If you want to solo, easiest place I can think of at 34 for a ranger
is the cougers in Iceclad. Snare, fear and whack on em while they run
away. It should get you to 36th lvl in a few hours. If you want to
group at that lvl, I'd check out the giant fort in Frontier Mountains.


Do rangers suck? Well, like all classes, some of them do <g>. If you
get yourself some decent equipment, hitpoint rings, rygorr armor and
decent weapons, you should be able to tank pretty well up to 50th lvl
or so. It's hard to tell without knowing what equipment you have atm.
If you see my shaman (Thurdar) around, send me a tell and maybe I can
check out your equipment.

Well, you could always park your monk there to loot and track them
with your ranger. My monk got his in his 30s, while running to the
overthere. Never really camped him though.
