Yeah, Deer Hunter actually was a big surprise and opened up a niche market
that was soon flooded with knockoffs.  It was targeted as a mid range game
that sold extremely well.  This helped out some of the smaller game shops
and has helped the industry immensly by not requiring every publisher to
have to make the next big hit to make money.

These types of games attract a different crowed than games like EQ or Quake.
These are the compulsive and thrifty buyers who might be looking for
something the whole family can play for a few hours here and there.

But the high end, highly anticipated games for hardcore gamers have to be
priced at the top of the range or they will be perceived as flawed.  I
disagree with the statistic that 9 of 10 will be bought because they are
cheaper.  Games are sold on hype and reputation.  Which is why you see so
many sequels and knock offs.  The average gamer will have done some research
before purchasing a game and the extra 5 or 10 bucks doesn't make that much
of a difference to most.

Since games are sold solely on their reputation, there is a peak in the
price/unit graph where the publisher believes they can make the most amount
and turn away the least number of buyers.
