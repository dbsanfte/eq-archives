I agree completely!

My main: a 52 DE SK.

Unless a fellow guildie gives me a SoW potion, I'm typically without all of
those new-fangled methods of transport. The only times I shout for a port
are when I've stupidly died halfway around the world from my bind point. I'm
not even averse to swimming, in lieu of ships (yes, I'll even swim the
oceans - I can typically swim across Iceclad before the ship returns to the
dock). These days, I seldom use the "taxi" channel, unless I need a port in
a hurry (like when I log on 20 minutes before a scheduled guild raid :D ).

So, when I travel, it typically takes me forever. But I like it. I get to
know the zones without having to resort to maps (and other "cheats"). I will
admit, however, I've become kind of used to the Luclin ports. I will often
use the Nexus as a Grand Central Station of sorts, but this still gives me
plenty of time to walk the land, as there is only one Luclin port per
continent.

At the moment, it says I've logged 61 days of play time, and I think half of
that was spent traveling.
