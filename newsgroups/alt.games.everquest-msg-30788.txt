Things must have changed a lot since the last time I have played a PvP
server then. I'll give it another look tonight.

PvP in online games if pretty much 100% about cheap shots. Specific to EQ, I
was probably attacked 50 times, every single one of them was when I was
either zone/lagging or already fighting a mob.

I think most of the people that play PvP servers are confused. They play a
very narrow cheap shot game and consider that to be the buy all end all to
PvP. Effective does not equate to a good PvP game.

We need a new term to exclude this type of behavior from a real PvP game
like Counter Strike or Descent. Something like PvC that stands for "Player
vs Cheat Shot Artist".
