No.  The free download that was (maybe still is) available was for the 
basic game only, not including any expansions.  It's cheaper to just buy 
the Gold edition with most (all?) of the expansions.  I suppose I should 
revise that "No".  Yes, if it's still available, you can get a free key for 
the basic game only (Faydwer, Antonica, Erud) and start an account without 
any of the expansions.  Then, if you wanted the expansions on that account, 
you'd have to buy the expansions.
