Ahh, I see you're experienced with Amex! I used to work for them, and at
times had to monitor phone conversations and "mark" employees on how
many times certain corporate designated topics were mentioned. During my
exit interview, when asked why I was leaving such a successful
corporation, I answered that I could no longer work in an environment
that rewarded corporate automatons over those giving excellent real,
personal service to customers. Still don't think he got it.....
