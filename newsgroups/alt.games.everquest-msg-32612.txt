I don't think I've seen a gandalf.  But at least one of every other lord of
the rings character.  Go to rivervale.  Every other character is named from
LotR.  What amuses me is the variations of the names from dune.  Yesterday I
saw Shihulud, or something close to that.  I had to sound it out a couple of
times before I realized what it was.  hehe In a way some of these people are
showing creativity.  A lack of imagination but a creative mangling of the
names.
