RAID certainly won't improve the load times on anything. RAID is used for
data integrity and availability, not performance. (In fact, if you set up
the wrong RAID type you'll take a performance hit, and a considerable one
at that) You take a performance hit with just about any type of RAID
array, but it depends on the access type and RAID type. (ie, match the
RAID method to the access method. Lots and lots of small reads and
writes? RAID 0+1. Few BIG reads and writes? RAID 5 etc etc..) In short,
don't put RAID on a home machine and expect it to perform better - the
exact opposite is most likely to occur.

RAID: Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks. A typical array will consist
of four disks (RAID 0+1) where two disks hold your data, and the other two
disks mirror the first two. If one disk dies, your system keeps ticking
right along with no speed or data loss. If two disks die, your system
keeps ticking right along with no data loss, but a considerable loss in
speed.

If you want fast load times, get yourself a good ATA100 or SCSI Ultrawide
mainboard and drive combo. Most affordable setup would be ATA100. Get a
good IBM 7200+ RPM drive in there and your data throughput and access
times will be like greased lightning. (Spend the extra $50 - $100 for the
IBM drives - they last about 10x as long as the crap from Western Digital
or Seagate)
