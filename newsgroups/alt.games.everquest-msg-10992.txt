well since we have been having trouble this is what my comp has in it now,
One NIC card one ethernet card, and one modem and the second computer has an
ether card.  we have the router, hub and switch and ME on *since it is the
easiest to work with* and configured all the information to what you said.
The second computer still can not connect to the dsl.

oh well, with the lock up problems i am having with my new computer, I am
not too worried about networking or dsl sharing, but playing eq!
