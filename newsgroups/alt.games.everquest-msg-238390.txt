Uhh, yeah, right.  Your news server either did not receive or forward the
previous 100 messages or so.  I believe that.  No, really.  I do.

: was intelligent enough to include the original post in their reply..

A normal person would still snip judiciously.  Like I did.  Like most of the
others that replied.  Unlike you.  Oh, and in case you missed it.  The OP
did not talk about fuck.  So, why would you care about what the fuck they
talked about?  Or is that your illiterate way of saying that you want
somehow to know if you may have been interested in the entire story only if
you can read it?  If so, Google for original posts.  Read them there if you
missed them.

: Read the above paragraph.  You, the constant reader, are an asshole, &
yea,

I feel so wounded.  Your rapier-like wit has wounded me to no end.

: I can believe how
: much time you clowns waste criticizing how people post on the USENET.

And you weren't, in effect, criticising the original poster?  You are a
hypocrite (look it up, you may learn something).

I can only assume there are few "like you" out there.  Most would have be
deceased as their lower intestines would have throttled them into submission
for being such a moron much, much earlier.  I can only assume that you are
lucky.
