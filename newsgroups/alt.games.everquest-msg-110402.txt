While the trivial is lower, you might as well max out trivial on fish rolls.
There
is -always- a fail chance, but it seems to drop as you go over the trivial
limit.
You could go further, but fish rolls are the item which can be made entirely
from vendor buyable items from one zone apart, and it will take no more than
an hour or two to get from zero skill to trivial.
