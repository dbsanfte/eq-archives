I have him on ignore after I reported him.

>/guildstatus works even for anon people.  Not that it helps much.

He wasn't with any guild at the time.

Most of us left when it was apparant the moron wouldn't leave.  I
think one stayed behind to "accidently" disspell the mob a few times.

I did get a response from the petition but it seems I need to provide
the evidence of delibrate train.  Just one problem: how do I provide
one when there's no GM online to witness?  Seems 5 or 6 petitions
doesn't count as evidence.

My guild however had a plan ready the next time that moron comes
along.  They plan to form a group of 65-70 and go to that area and
start killing everything in sight to deprieve the moron of any mob for
killing but since they won't be KSing and there won't be training,
there won't be any "violation".  And he'd be on /ignore so all rants
will fall on deaf ear.
