Now you mention it, yeah, I see what you mean. That said, while EQ1 had 
a mass of varied equipment, character models were limited and didn't 
always reflect what you were wearing, so while you could have all sorts 
of varied equipment (I have yet to find anyone else with my glowing 
split-paw mask) you wouldn't actually look that much different.
