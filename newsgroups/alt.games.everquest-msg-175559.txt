Dear Bot,

I'm sure all your friends are so uber they reach their haste cap with
just equipment alone, and maybe a bard song.
Hmm, best item haste is 41%, best bard song 15%, makes 56.  Leaves
about 50 left for the cap - where 50% of celerity would be a good use
of mana.  But I'm sure you're uber enough to make up for that 20% less
DPS just with your personallity.
It'd scare the living daylights out of me to be grouped with you -
maybe it has the same effect on mobs.
