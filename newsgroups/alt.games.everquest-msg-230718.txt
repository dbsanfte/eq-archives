Hmmm.  You know I spent a lot of money twinking a Necro alt with both
int and char gear.  Then I hear in the serverwide necro channel that
its pretty much common knowledge that charms and mezzes only check
charisma for chanters.  However no one said anything about duration. 
Man I hate operating on what "they" say.  You can waste a lot of money
building up a stat only to find out that you wasted your time and
money.

My understanding (main is a 65 Ranger) is that it doesn't affect the
chance of it resisting, but instead the chance that if it does resist,
the mob will aggro.  Without steins my Rangers has sub-100 charisma
and pulling in BoT has usually meant that a resist almost always
equals an aggro.  (I can think of only one time I got a resist that
didn't aggro).  However, resists are rare enough that I haven't
bothered too much with charisma.  So this line of logic seems to make
sense.  I see people that do get resists and they don't seem to get
guaranteed aggro from it like I do.  Seems to me that only a few
things could make that happen.  Stats and spell casting level.  (Druid
casting would have some specialize advantage, as well as possibly
focus effects, etc...)
