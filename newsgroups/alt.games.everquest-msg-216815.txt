It would be a disaster if they tried.

As someone else said, I can't see anyone paying money to keep a character
existing in a game they just quit.   And for a *lot* of people, a deleted
character would be a game ending event.    I can't see very many people
above mid levels who being willing to do it all over again, days of playing
just to get back where they used to be.   The higher the level / equipment
of the character, the more this is true.   I myself would not have returned,
had my characters not been waiting for me.

Considering the rate of recidivism among former EQ players, I think they
would have lost a lot of business.
