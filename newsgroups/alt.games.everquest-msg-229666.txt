More graphics to turn off?

Most of the inherent weaknesses of Eq could be fixed from the inside. The
only real unsolvable problem is that 90% of the content has been completely
consumed.

My pet peeves
1)nodrop equipment makes absolutely no sense, level restricted euipment that
could easily show up for people of insuficient level.
2)class balance, and some classes dont bear the correct nomiker
3)raids balanced for 72 people of class xxxx,yyy,zz,l and groups balanced
for x,y,h,p. actually im not really fond of raiding at all even though I do
so for phat lewts.
4)needless tedium , (kill 172 goblins to raise a skill, camp item here for 3
days, omg tradeskills, etc)
5)rewards are far too closely tied to political skill (ldon starting to fix
this, but i would much prefer for instance a system where a raid killed the
uber mob and 3 random raid members gain their droppable ubereuipment they
have no use for )
6)skills, levels and class advancement are far to strictly laid out.

thats about it . All are addressable in eq. Somehow I dont expect eq 2 to
address them any better than eq does.
