A very large section of those items are ToV style loot, or off Dain, or from
VP, or Master Yael, etc.  The only ones that are really obtainable without
being in an upper end guild are;
Obulus Death Shroud,
Crystalline torque ,
Frostreavers cloak if you buy it,
Rokyl's channeling crystal,
Amulet of Insight maybe (icewell drop, but off a wuss mob),
Gem encrusted ring is droppable (but no longer drops),
White Dragonscale cloak is droppable, from a white dragon encounter,
Idol of the Underking from Master Yael, and
Mosquito Hide Belt from CT.

Makes me twitch, just because everyone says it doesn't make an excuse for
using it.

You don't have to wear it always, swap it in, Symbol, swap it out. (or in a
level, you can be even lazier, swap in, BoA, swap out, but much less often).
Especially given that you already have one on an alt, so you wouldn't even
have to pay for it.
