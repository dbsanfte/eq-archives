Or bard with AoE as I found out the hard way.

I used to equip my McVaxious Horn of War (spelling) when I am in the bazaar
to sell as it gives extra Charisma. I hit my Selos hot key and then noticed
everyone glowing from what suspiciously looked like a bard song, but what
idiot would be such an asshole to use AoE bard song in the Bazaar though?

*queue sinking feeling*

*checks spell bubbles*

That's not the selo's bubble - what the heck is that? I quickly scrable to
turn it off and check my spell book, yup... Denons Disprupting Discord. Next
thing you know the traders surrounding me start blinking out of existance
making a very suspicious gap in the stalls centred on none other than yours
truly...

*slinks away*

I picked up a pair of +25 Char steins shortly after to make sure the same
thing can't happen again.
