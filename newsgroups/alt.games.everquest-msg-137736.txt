Well spotted. :)

}I like to think of it as more predisposition rather than
}predetermination.  You are born with tendencies that if followed will
}lead you in a given direction, but that is not to say that you must
}follow them.  Free will can over come natural inclinations as anyone who
}has resisted the urge to rip their boss' throat out with their teeth can
}attest to.

Yes, predispstion, sure, my main issue is that scentists are trying to 
track more and more personality traits to a genetic predsposition, and 
then people with those traits tend to use it as an excuse...  'Oh, well, 
I'm genetically predisposed to be an alcoholic, since my dad and mom were, 
so there's no point in me trying to show modeation.'  'But your honor, 
it's been shown that being a murderous wifebeating bastard is hereditary!  
My client is clearly merely a victim of his genes, and should therefore be 
set free, with possible counseling...'

So... I don't like it. :)

}If there is a god I think that free will was one of his
}sneakiest tricks so rather than share your wish for that to be an over
}riding factor negating predetermination, I'd prefer it the other way
}around so I don't have to feel bad when my will is weak hehe.  I don't
}believe that, I just wish it were so.

Bah, with two heads, you should have two spines!  You have no excuse for 
being weak willed. :)
