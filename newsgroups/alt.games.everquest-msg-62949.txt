Actually they do now, they changed the rules and they always would if
it violated their policy. The first name still won't be changed unless
all by itself it violates policy.

See, now they changed it to them changing your last name if you simply
request it:

http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp

"Conditions for Name Changes:

First names will not be changed unless they violate the Naming Policy.
Players often petition to have their name or surname changed, or to
ask for a surname that the /surname command will not allow.


Conditions for Surname Changes:

Customer Service will change a playerï¿½s last name at his or her
request, provided that the player is level 20+ and either the
requested surname, or the requested combination of the first name and
surname does not violate the Naming Policy. Upon approval, this change
may either result in the player receiving a new surname or else with
the removal of the surname altogether. "


That is an update to the older policy of only changing the surname if
the combination violated the naming rules or if the char was getting
married. Essentially that rule only caused lots of "sham" marriages
for a character to get a new name.
