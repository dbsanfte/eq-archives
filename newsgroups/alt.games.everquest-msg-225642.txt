I'm not desperate for plat, but it only took me to
refuse to fall into line with the pricing plan for
everyone else to break it, too. In fact, it was kinda
silly of them. I had about 30 left and would have
been sold out of them in an hour or so and they could
have had what they wanted.......until I returned with
more. Seemed *they* were more desperate for plat than
I was. :P
