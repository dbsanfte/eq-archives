I just kept trying. On Win2k, The Everquest process would use all the CPU
(racing) until it connected. If it didn't connect in the first few seconds,
it never would. I would kill the process and try again. Most of the time it
would connect, get some way into the "_verquest.exe" download and either
hang or slow down so much that it was unusable (100 bytes per minute).

If it made it through the connect, then the "_verquest.exe" download, it
would pop up a message saying the the EQ patcher was locked or I didn't have
admin privilege - I'm logged on as administrator. This usually occured when
downloading "maintanence.txt".

BTW, I killed any everquest process from the task manager and deleted all of
the recently updated files between each try. Anyway, after the 15th try or
so, the EQ patcher window popped up, the big one with Fironna the wolf and
the Vah Shir, not the little text pop up, and the main downloads started.
Been going for about an hour now with another hour to go.

Crossing my fingers ... Keep trying ...
