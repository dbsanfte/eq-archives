Yeah, the scaling of mission is something that cries out to be copied and 
pasted by other MMOGs, same as the sidekick thing.  I doubt we will see 
any major game without these features in a couple years.  On the other 
hand, CoH doesn't have pulls scaled to team size like DAoC has.  Pulls 
depend on the positioning of the opponents and to some extent luck.  Even 
if you had a character as powerful as a necro in CoH (and to some extent 
Illusion seems close once you get pets), you would still be swarmed by a 
bad pull.  In DAoC you can position your character, and pull mobs of ideal 
size one by one until you outlevel them or fall asleep.
