Well, my 15 chanter is in Oasis (three zones from FP) right now, and doing 
fine. Plaxces to level include Crush and NRo. I would suggest NRo as there 
are rarely more than 15 people in the zone (on Drinal at least) and the 
Derv camps are easy if you can get a tank or two and a cleric... You play 
crowd control and let them kill them one by one, which will help space the 
spawn.

Well, what do you have?

Have you done the Stein quest yet?
