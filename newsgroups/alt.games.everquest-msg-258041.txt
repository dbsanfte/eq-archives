The important part of it is the pull.    An AE causing a pet to attack
before everyone is ready generally means your raid is in deep shit.  /pet
back off won't save you, if you've let it get that far.    All it takes is
one attack, and thats the pull you're taking, adds or not, healing started
on the MT or not, and anything else that could possibly go wrong.
