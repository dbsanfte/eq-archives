Automated content creation isn't an adequate solution. Although it can 
be incorporated as part of one, and definately isn't a bad thing.

One big problem with automated content creation is that it lacks 
flavour. Consider the generated dungeons of diablo... they are good, and 
its nice that by and large you have to 'explore' to find things... but 
you learn the 'variability' and take it in stride. And while each time 
you play it is different, its never much different.

Consider again the lack of flavour of such a system. You aren't going to 
end up with Kelethin, Shar Vahl, Katta Castellum, and Runnyeye running 
an RTS city builder. Even if you mix up the building palettes for the 
models...  You might be able to swing a hundred variations of Freeport 
with different building models, but its not the same thing.

As a component of the quest engine sure. But it can't be all of it. 
Human designed quests are better. Generated quests will have no story to 
them. Or at least... not a compelling one.
