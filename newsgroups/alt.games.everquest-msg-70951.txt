I'm playing more than ever.  I rarely leave the moon anymore except to buy
spells that I can't get there.  Moved four of my characters to the moon
and just bounce back and forth between them to explore all the zones and
see the sights.  Right now all my video bug issues are on the old world
(Antonica, Kunark, Velious).  The video bugs get  pretty bad there (can't
see the boats correctly anymore and polygon shifting on the landscape),
but Luclin is seamless.  Guess that means I'm kinda stuck on the moon for
now ;)

For me SoL has really made the game fresh again.  I guess I may be in the
minority, but for me it's great.
