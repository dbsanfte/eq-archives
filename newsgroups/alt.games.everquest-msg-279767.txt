Half the player BASE, or half the players ONLINE. I'm of the view that 
they make up half the players ONLINE. As I tried to illustrate in my 
last post, that's considerably less than half the accounts.

That's a logical flaw. The guy who logs in once every couple weeks is 
(perhaps ironically) your most valuable customer. 12.00 out of his 12.95  
is pure profit. Satisfying the hard core raider requires constant event 
tuning, constant influx of content, a boatload of bandwidth and 
processor time, etc. He is your least profitable customer. (Though he 
may be a valuable product ambassador.)

It seems clear to me that satisfying the casuals should be given more 
attention, and real solutions -- not just bandaids and handouts. 

Its true in so many industries... the hard core/power users/enthusiasts 
may be vocal and active, but they actually tend to cost you money. Its 
joe-sixpack who buys your service or product, uses it occasionally 
without pushing the envelope, without ever calling for help, without 
trying to mod it or make it xtreme etc... He's where you actually make 
your money.  

**And he's who the products are really designed for.**

Supporting the extremists in those situations is really more about 
marketing than profit. They actually cost money, but having them as 
positive product ambassors brings in the 'regular' people who will make 
you money. 

If EQ alienates its bulk playerbase, and becomes a product or service 
just for the extremists then the price will go up. WAY up. (Just 
reference any piece of pc hardware, sports hardware, automotive 
hardware, etc targeted at the "hardcore". Its expensive. Partly because 
its limited demand, partly becuase the audience will pay, and partly 
because "it really does cost that damn much" after you factor in your 
support costs.

Thus in my view the raiders are subsidized by an army of joe-casuals. 
That's acceptable (and sustainable) only so long as joe-casual is kept 
happy.
