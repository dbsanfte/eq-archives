Oh the watching for the griffon part hasn't changed, just the reason...
Now you _want_ the griffon to kill you, at least when it's time to hit
the bank.  What they've done, while making it safe to twink at L1, is
to also make it pretty much unnecessary to twink until L10.  Lowbie
death is not only painless now, it is advantageous!  Want to start a
new character and pretend you're doing it "the hard way"?  Go right
ahead, and when you're loaded up on newbie crap loot in CB just charge
those two Legos over there:  "look ma!  my warrior can teleport!"

Every single character under L10 now has the Gate spell at 0 mana cost.
The only advantage a caster gets from using the actual spell is that
they do not have to remem their spells.  And for all you melees who've
been enjoying EQ's anti-melee bias for the last 3 years, well we won't
help you out, but we'll let the 8-year-olds joining the game now have
an advantage that you never even dreamed of asking for, free Gate with
zero down-time, and it recycles your LH/HT if you are a Paladin/SK.

EQ has nearly completed the transformation to a PlayStation game, all
that's left is to configure the user interface. :(
