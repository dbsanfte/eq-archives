Or do they introduce such bugs deliberately in order to whet people's
appetites?  (E.g., I wonder if the high selling price of salt-water
crabs/tuna when GoD came out, was intended to lure people into buying
the expansion?  Ditto the abnormally high tribute values of some items.)

Still, though it's easy to come up with conspiracy theories, I prefer
the old maxim: Never ascribe to malice that which can be adequately
explained by stupidity.
