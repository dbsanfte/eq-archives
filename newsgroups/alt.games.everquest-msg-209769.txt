}I hadn't heard this item based level based haste effect rumor that you are
}talking about (and seem to have observed), but I did hear that the cap to haste
}is based on your level, instead of the 100 haste that many people assume is the
}target of their item haste plus spell haste combination.  If that cap is very
}low at very low levels, then you might see no difference between a 10% haste
}item and a 20% haste item... if this theory is correct, then the small hastes
}that shaman and enchanters get at low levels might still be useless on twinks,
}who already have their haste at the cap from some kind of 22% or 41% haste item.

This is, in fact, the case.  I engineered a 800 HP firebeetle of testing 
(Charm. SLN. Charm break.), got a couple low-delay weapons, and created a 
couple level 1's to measure haste caps with.  I got bored pretty quick, 
though, so the data is probably not good to as many decimal places as I'm 
about to give you. :) Oh, then of course I took all the equipment -except- 
the FBSS off one of the level 1's... and deleted him.  Dang black 
equipment on black backgrounds!  But the GM got it back for me a week 
later, whew.  

Anyway, here's my data:
level 1 Warrior:  25.475%
level 1 shaman:   20.000%
level 6 Paladin:  27.910%

Each character had FBSS and Aanya's Quickening (back when we could do 
that. :) )

Yea, I'll bet money those numbers should be 25, 20, and 28. :)

}Since keeping melee hasted is a big chunk of mana, those people might want to
}know about this effect.  Since its a big reason they get invited into groups,
}they might be better off if noone else finds out about it.

Eh, let the rumor get out.  The one twink in 10 that's actually item-haste 
capped past level 6ish, who knows about it, is also likely to be the one 
who has enough clue to realize we hasters bring oh so much more to a group 
than just haste.  And if not, he's gonna be what, 0.1% of potential 
groupmates?  Not everyone has a spare cowl of mortality lying around. :)
And all the minmaxers will work out that by level 6ish their haste cap is 
28%, which is just soooo much more than their RBG that they -must- have 
uberspiffy chanter haste for the extra 1% :)

}Of course if you are correct and its the items themselves that give different
}effects based on your level (possibly level and class) then thats a whole other
}ball game.

I've seen no evidence that the item haste varies with wearer's level.  I 
ran a separate test of level 1 warrior with just FBSS.  He came out very 
close to 21% haste.  Can't find that log at the moment though. :)

}Llyric, 57 bard, haste song and "over the cap" haste song
}Paax, 51 shaman haste caster
}Matte, 30 enchanter haste caster
}(to demonstrate a vested interest in not finding out)

Looks more like you're (a) the ideal set of folks to figure it out, and 
(b) really ought to want to know when you're wasting your mana... If you 
can cap em with a lower haste that has better other stat stuff with it 
and saves you mana, shouldn't you?

Well, time to get back to leveling my bard so I can do the experiments 
myself.  And some complicated stacking ones, ooo... :)
