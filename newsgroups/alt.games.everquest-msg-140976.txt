    Remember, we are trying to talk about a guild that can't kill Cazic yet.
;-) You need discipline. Everyone has to stay behind the gnome so it can
path freely, and as soon as something spawns/gets in the way you need a
feign-capable class to tag the gnome and pull it behind everyone else during
the fight. Once you have camp clear, move the gnome back where it was
before, have the feigner get out of the gnome's path, and feign to continue.
With four groups I can see a lot of people getting in the way of the gnome,
and if you do that he paths into walls and warps/poofs.

    Assuming single pulls (I'll take your word as a monk that it can be
done), you need to clear the PHs for a bit. The PHs summon. So does the
Warlord. Mobs that summon, while in theory possible for a wizard to kill,
are a huge amount of pain. Lots of wasted mana on Tishan's or however it is
they do it. And I don't see a clear area to kite in - it would have to be
root/nuke, I'm guessing.

    Ayup. Which is crazy - I can pick up a Ceremonial Smudging Stick, AC 3
WIS 3 MANA 30 FR/PR/MR 10 all/all ranged slot for between 1000 and 1500 pp.
Some items just have a high word-of-mouth value attached to them.
