The bearform hp regen is 1 or 2 points depending on which spell.  The 
amount of mana regen from medding is far greater than added hp regen from 
actually sitting, particularly when you consider that you should have 
your best regen spell going on yourself for much better hp regen anyway.  
All that being said, I sold my Drogmar off after a few weeks, I found it 
too annoying to use overall, and, being the cheap one, too slow for 
travelling.  When I am soloing, I am sitting 90% of the time anyway, when 
I am grouping, I can sit a fair amount of the time.
