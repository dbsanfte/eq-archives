Is anybody else having trouble with disconnects in general or, more
specifically, staying alive in the bazaar (E'ci server)?

I use 2 P4 computers, both running XP Pro, on Comcast cable internet.  The
first box is the one I play on the most and I usually get disconnected at
least once a session.  The second box is used by other family members and
for my mule.  When both boxes are playing, they mostly get disconnected
together, which would indicate to me that the cable connection is the
problem, but sometimes just one dies.  The mule is up for an hour or two at
most.  Neither computer is doing anything except EQ and Magelo and not
running Magelo doesn't help at all.

Like I said, I'm thinking it't the cable connection but I want to be sure
before complaining.  Does anybody have any ideas or suggestions?  Anybody
with similar problems, Comcast or not?

Thanks in advance.

Clayton
