Hi all,

As a recent convert to EQ I initially bought EQ New Dawn from Ubisoft. They
have suggested that the best way to get the add-ons that did not come with
the this version of the game is to download them from SOE via the patcher.
Does everyone agree with this or is there another option? What is the
procedure to pay for the add-ons/ get licence codes etc? I usually prefer to
have CD copies of software I have paid for.

Thanks,

Andrew
