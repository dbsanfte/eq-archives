It's for saving enchanters, basically :)

Remedy doesn't heal enough in the time it takes to cast (and for the
spell gems to refresh).  Divine Light has the highest HP/casting time
ratio of any heal spell (OK, Complete Heal is better sometimes, but a
10 second casting time is no good when your enchanter is getting beaten
on).

It's also occasionally useful for emergency situations where a tank is
taking damage too quickly to wait 10 seconds for a CH.  Not an
efficient heal, but situationally very useful.
