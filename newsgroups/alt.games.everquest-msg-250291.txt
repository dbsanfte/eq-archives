The 'heavy crafters' have been demanding for the last 3 years or so in every
game that they may be a crafter to the exclusion of  everything else; SWG is
the first game to really really give that to them. I know 1 of them. She
claims she wants to craft. She wants to kill nothing, and make stuff. No xp
grinds of killing hundreds of rabbits, let her make stuff to make her way to
master chef.

And she did it. She mastered chef and tailor. And then complained that all
she had to do in game was make stuff. She had no combat skills, no place FOR
combat skills. She couldn't go hunting with us. She couldn't heal, or
entertain. She just made clothes and food.

So she ripped her character down and started over as a bounty hunter.

I always thought the macro system needed a bit tweaking to make the game a
little less automatable.

And somewhat common these days it seems. At least it wasn't like DAoC where
you could swim across the rivers of lava (for no damage). Though I never saw
lava, actually.

At least you can make things go up in houses now... no more needing stairs
to hang paintings on the walls.
