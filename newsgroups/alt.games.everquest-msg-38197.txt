It would seem Knology's news server is dropping posts left and right
again. Extremely irritating to see it say that it's downloading 50
posts, and only end up with 7. I *know* my KF isn't catching that many
posts... I'm seeing replies to posts by people I don't have KFed, but
missing the originals.

*sighs and wanders off to kick the techs at Knology*

I know what they'll find
It's in their mind
It's what they want to see...
