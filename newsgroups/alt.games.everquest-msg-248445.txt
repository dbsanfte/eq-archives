I think this might answer the question I was thinking of asking...

I've noticed that sometimes when I'm on, I have new-looking bats and rats
(aye, the rats are huge, but I like!). I asked my buddy who roleplays as my
brother if they look different for him, but they don't...ever. Now,
sometimes I don't get the new models, just the old ones. I noticed this
weekend, after quitting out of EQ shortly and coming back in, that the rat
in Nurga near where I camped out (rats rarely spawn in that particular spot,
which is how I knew it was the same one) had changed from the new model back
to the old one.

Now I know why; I guess when I'm seeing the new rats/bats, it's right after
I've been on the test server, but when I see the old ones, it's the second
patch on the same server (FV in this case). And that's why my buddy doesn't
see them, because he never goes on the test server...

Thanks for clearing up my mystery with your question. :) And I may have
answered yours...just quit out of EQ when you see the new bats/rats on your
main server, repatch, and it should revert back to the old models.
