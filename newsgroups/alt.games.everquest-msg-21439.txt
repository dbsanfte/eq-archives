As Illarion mentioned it's in your Particle Density setting (under Options
>> Display, I think...same place you change resolution I think).

I had the same experience...I finally find GD and ask in /ooc where Thurg
was.  I was told "under the waterfall."  That's nice...WHAT waterfall?  But,
with the waterfall off you can see the entrance pretty clearly and when I
got to a bunch of people I kinda assumed that was where the zone was.
