This is what root/blind is for. It can be dispelled by the mage, but
that will take away their casting time, and you can just root/blind it
again. After that, no, a mage cannot outnuke the cleric's heals.
Knockback is good, but if you're playing someone who's practiced a
little, they'll most likely step through it. Clerics have stuns, too.
A cleric with a little PvP experience will be able to cast just fine.
If the mage's MR is low enough for the cleric to cast on them, I
wouldn't be surprised if the cleric won.
