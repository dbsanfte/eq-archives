It might be challenging, but you sound like you are up to it, push
deeper into ykesha, and don't forget to grab solo tasks on the way in.
  The loot, xp and rare drops are great, and the beaten path tends to
pass it by EVEN Though dulak and gunthak are hot zones right now.

Other interesting stuff that might push your limits would be agro
kiting in Nightmare.

Maidens Eye and the temple off of there will start being good hunting
grounds right about now too.
