I'm not saying otherwise, not saying we don't have the gear or levels to 
do this.  I am, however, saying that the various posts on Allahkazam 
where people say they've done encounter X with a group of 3 level 75's 
in high end TSS gear don't apply to us either.

And I'm saying that while we do have some pieces of VP (a couple, we 
were in there for one raid before they revamped to 2.0, and while we've 
managed to get the 2.0 key, nobody has killed anything in there, and 
some Vex Thal (I think we've cleared the zone four times now) and some 
elemental (enough that almost everyone has one piece, hardly anyone has 
more than two), we haven't had months of farming in those lower end 
zones, because they've only been live on our server for a short time.

What we've got that they didn't have, on the other hand, are hot zone 
loots, Fabled gear, and the more easily acquired gear out of GOD, OOW, 
and DON; we're not raiding there, sticking to progression, so we do Time 
first, but individuals are hitting solo and single group targets during 
their off time.

And levels, because not even the most hardcore "stick to progression" 
members of the guild are refusing to level to 70.

SO I'm not saying "we're total wimps compared to the guys that beat this 
the first time", I'm just trying to state roughly where we are for other 
people who might be trying this in the future, or remembering what it 
was like when they did it themselves.
