Auggies - Augmentation - is just FINE.  It's got plenty of haste on it for
what they need, it's got AC on it, it's got stamina regen on it for your
warriors and those bloody wurmslayers (fatigueslayers).  Heck, to this day I
use Augmentation on lowlevels I'm buffing - the long duration makes it a
winner.  "The best haste" an enchanter has is the haste that keeps the party
killing - so unless they want to wait for you to medd up between pulls,
they'll take Auggies and like it - or you'll find a group that does.

Ah, those were the days...
