In general I like it; however, I resist the notion of any zone
potentially having a 160 ZEM - There is no way that a level 55 Sun
Rev that hits for 170 should give the same xp (given equal number
of people in the zone) as a 55 PoN mob that hits for 350.  Instead
I would advocate a ZEM range for each zone.

Of course, it's easy for me to say this as my friends and I like to
find non-mainstream things to do.

Another thing I'd like to see is an adaptation of the DAoC anti-camping
mechanism.  For those who don't know, the longer a mob stays alive in
DAoC the more xp it gives (I'm not sure if this is still true, I played
for a couple of months at release.)

So, perhaps add a Mob Age Bonus (like the Group bonus, it's multiplied
by the base xp before division.)  It could start at 1.0, then for every
x minutes it's alive increment by 1
