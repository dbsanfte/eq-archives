OMFG

You just described the current situation in my guild TO A T! There's a
series of threads going on right now about "isn't there *some* time that
we could agree to on scheduled days of the week when all of our A list
folks will make an effort to be online and ready to raid?"  

Your post was just spooky. If I didn't know you were on another server,
I'd swear it was written by one of my guildmates.

However, the one thing I don't agree with is the guild-split thing being
inevitable. Our guild (and many other "family guilds" that I know of,
have been going through sine wave cycles like this for ages. We get to a
point where we do a few cool raids successfully, attract even a few more
high level people, do something even bigger, then raiding falls apart.
Then, rather than a guild split en masse, high level folks get tired of
not being able to raid and they /guildremove one by one and go join
raiding guilds. That's how it's always been.

/sigh
