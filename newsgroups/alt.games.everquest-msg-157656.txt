If you did it because you liked helping your guild
members and friends, how does having them able
to move around better without your assistance
make them worse off? How does it make *you*
worse off?

If you were that deeply concerned about the welfare
of your guildies and friends, you should be *happy*
about this.

I can accept that for you the money may not be a
big deal, but if you're not doing it for the money,
are you doing it for the welfare of your friends, or
for the kick you get out of helping other people?

I get the occasional free port. It's nice when it happens,
but I would prefer not to bug anybody about it, and
when nobody is available, I'm *stuck*.
