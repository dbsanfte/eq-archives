Everyone's done it, waking up at your bind point with no idea where
you were killed, falling asleep while running across WK and going in
the water, killed by a gnoll pup cuz he aggroed on you while you fell
asleep medding . . .  OK, maybe it's just me, but surely a few of you
have some funny stories?  Let's hear about your napping experiences in
Norrath !!
