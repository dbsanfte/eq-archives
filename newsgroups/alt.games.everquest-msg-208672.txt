I hesitate to tell you something that gets you killed, but I spent some time
in Thurgadin Mines (the zone in Velious, not the similarly named zone in
LoY) as an int caster around levels 39-40 and I just jumped when I came to a
ladder.  I could never get the hang of going down them correctly.  The
damage wasn't bad, but a levitate potion or spell would probably be a nice
safety net the first time you do it (remember, you still need a batwing as a
component for the potion to work).
