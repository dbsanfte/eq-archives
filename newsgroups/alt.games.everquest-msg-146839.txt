And your source for this certainty is what, exactly?

After all, Verant has had three years to fix this if it were indeed
and exploit. Or if they couldn't fix it, they might at least have
mentioned somewhere, sometime, that quad kiting is an exploit.

I've been playing since the game was released, and I don't recall ever
hearing of Verant taking action against someone for quad kiting.

But hey, you're so certain that you know Verant's intent, tell us all
about your sources.
