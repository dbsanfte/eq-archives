Well, that's true, isn't it?  Sure, the odds are low, but if I was going 
to stage a home invasion, I'd probably attack at exactly the moment I saw 
you let someone in.  So much easier than mucking about with lockpicks.

And the point is, in this case, yes, you do have to lower security for 
-everyone- for a couple minutes in order to let Sony's stupid ActiveX 
control do its thing.
