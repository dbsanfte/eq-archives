When did I say I wouldn't accept it for bestiality or pedophilia?

In fact, I'm quite prepared to suggest that a pedophile may not in fact 
be choosing to be attracted to children, anymore than I have chosen to 
be attracted to women. I'm just wired that way, perhaps they are too.

Perhaps its possible to rewire them, perhaps rewiring them would make 
them cease to be who they are. Perhaps that is our place, perhaps not. 
I'm not convinced there is a simple right thing to do 'to' them to 
'fix' them. I am convinced its a very tricky subject.

At any rate, regardless of whether or not we agree on the cause of their 
attraction. We do agree that they shouldn't be allowed to -act- on their 
desires because they are invariably harmful to the objects of their 
desire given that we beleive children / animals cannot give consent. (as 
Faned noted).

But if they have sufficient self control and moral repulsion at the idea 
of the inevitable rape they would commit if they acted, and thus refrain 
from acting, then are they 'bad' people? Can we fault them for the way 
they've been wired?

And to show just how wishy-washy that is...in many places adultery is 
not a crime... so you can marry only one person at a time... but sleep 
around as much you want, legally. At which point the marriage  from a 
legal standpoint is effectively reduced to a checkbox on your tax 
return.
