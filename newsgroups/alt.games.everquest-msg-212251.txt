  I consider most of OS a money camp at 61+, the fact that most of the
mobs at Bugs or Necro are deep blue again is just a nice fringe
benefit <g>. I don't recall anything dark blue in Torigans Mines even
before I hit 65. Droga might well be the best bet though, especially
if you invis in deep enough to fight the lvl 61 mobs. 

Assuming we get that magic based DoT with LDoN, Veksar would probably
move close to the top on my list of places to solo. Burn some IVU
potions to get in deep and there's decent exp, a shot at good loot and
single pullable mobs.

Is that the camp right past the castle in PoV? Hadn't thought about
that one but you're right. No roamers, single pulls and mobs that
don't summon. Has the potential to be a pretty nice spot.
