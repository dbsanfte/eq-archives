You think that the people in this forum are non-power, casual players? ROFL!

You're either confusing me with someone else (perhaps the previous poster?)
or you're jumping to unfounded conclusions about my intentions). I cancelled
my accounts before even hearing about this (I wouldn't cancel over this),
obviously for other reasons. If and when I come back (I've taken breaks from
EQ before, the first time 2 years, the 2nd time 8 months, I sure don't rule
it out), it won't be because I've gotten over anything, it'll be because I
want to play EQ again.  I don't care to "stick it to the man", lol, like I
said, I can see the business case for doing this. Look to others to be
"sticking it to the man". Still lol ...
