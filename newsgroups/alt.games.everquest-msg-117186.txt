www.chipsbits.com Has the EverQuest Trilogy for $24.95 which is what I think
I bought it for at the BX here on Base (Air Force).  It also comes with a
free month of play.  I'm not sure how much it would be to buy each of the
expansions seperately, but if you think there is even the slim chance you
will enjoy the game I would recommend buying the Trilogy.  A) You're gonna
end up buying it all anyway B) Will make the patch time a lot shorter since
some of the "patching" is in the trilogy.

Just my opinion though, I could be wrong.
