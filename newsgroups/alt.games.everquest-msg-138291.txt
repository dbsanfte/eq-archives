I bought a Staff of Living Sands yesterday.  24 damage, 42 delay 1.75
ratio,  procs Smothering Sands, a +200 Dot that fires off at level 23,
+4 wisdom, +40 mana and a couple of other stats I don't care about.  It
is by far the best weapon I have ever owned, on any of many, many
characters that I have played.  I am very fired up about this.
   Cost, 250 plat.  Currently going for 800-900 plat on FV.

a good cleric with
           this baby burning a hole in my hand.
