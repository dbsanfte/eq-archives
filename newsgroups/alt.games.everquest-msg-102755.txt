It doesn't have to be the dot.

You also have to remember that mobs over level 35 have a chance to
'remember' you when you stand up again. They may not come running
across the whole zone to get to you but their agro range for you will be
about triple normal. If you get anywhere close to them the will make
a bee-line for you.

Generally if the mob has a spawn point it stands at, i.e. its not a wandering
mob, it has about a 90% chance to forget you when it returns 'home.' If its
a wandering mob it has a higher chance to 'remember' you.
