Don't bother.  The market for these things is very, very limited, and anyone
who needs them for tradeskilling can easily find a dwarven cleric to imbue
for them.  You'll be lucky to get a buyer a month.

If you want funds, I'd suggest getting into some minor tradeskilling.  Not
much, you don't have to be a GM to make money.  For example, get your
tailoring high enough to make leather padding.  Kill wolves, bears, even
zombies, and save their skins.  Use them to make leather padding which you
can sell for 20-25pp each in the bazaar.  Or go to PoK and buy some Essences
of Marr and Celestial Solvent.  Use a mortar and pestle to combine them into
Celestial Essence (a no-fail combine, no skill required).  Total cost for
one combine: 3.7pp.  Sell for 5pp.  Okay, it's not a lot, but sell 20 of
them and you've made yourself 26pp in profit.  Sell 200 and make 260pp.
Celestial Essences are used in a *lot* of recipes so you can make a steady
income off of those.

This is all predicated, of course, on you having a bazaar mule that you can
leave up for hours.

When I was a level 29 cleric, I too was dirt poor.  About the only thing I
could do was continue grouping and get some gems and other things to sell to
vendors.  Eventually you will get awarded some cool stuff from the mobs you
kill that you can sell in the bazaar for a few hundred plat.  Over time, you
may even collect a few thousand platinum pieces.  It's a slow process for a
first-time character, I know.  Lots of other people had to go through it,
too, so don't feel left out because everyone else has platinum leaking out
of their ears while you have moths floating out of your pockets.  It will
come with time.
