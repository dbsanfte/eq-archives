Groovy.  I'll be snipping out a bit to make reading easier.

If you move while hiding, but not sneaking, hide is broken.

Eh.  I have noticed a difference in my speed from when I was a low level 
rogue.  Like Davian said, it seems to have improved with level since Kunark. 
I do think some of it has to do with the Innate Run Speed (three ranks in 
General, 1 AA point per rank) and the Swift Journey AA (two ranks in Gates, 
5 AA points per rank).

It doesn't always put you at the bottom of the list for agro.  Who's at the 
top and bottom depends on what the other group members are doing (spells, 
taunting, etc).  It does help a good bit making sure that you're not taking 
the hits though. :) Agro is cumulative.  Evading reduces your agro, while 
giving the tank time to hit and taunt and build more agro.  And since you're 
not hitting the mob PLUS evading, the proportional agro on the mob shifts to 
where it belongs: on the tank.

Heals can generate a good bit of agro, mind you. :)

The evade timer is however long it takes for the sneak and hide abilities to 
repop and allow for use again.  The Escape AA is definately something you 
don't want to use like monks would use FD for pulling, except on rare 
occasions.  The primary reason is that the Escape ability has a 72 minute 
reuse timer, so you hold onto it as a "get out of death free" card.  Also 
unlike feign death, you don't have to wait three minutes before a message 
pops up saying that your enemies have forgotton about you.

Ah, heh, no worries.  Pickpocketing failures and successes definately do not 
tell the group you're in what you've just stolen.
