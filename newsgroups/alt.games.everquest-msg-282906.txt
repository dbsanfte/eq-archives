I know Seeq Endestroi (sp?) has a Blogger/Blogspot blog that he uses to
write about his EQ adventures.  I can't remember the URL at the moment.
Hopefully he'll speak up or you might be able to Google for it.  You might
want to try Googling for "blog everquest".  Who knows what might pop up.

I'd start out with Blogger if I were you.  It's easy and free (and where I
blog now).  If you decide to continue with it you could get your own URL and
go from there.  I used Movable Type when I had my own website.  It's also
easy to use and has a free version.

As for me, I've been blogging since 2001.  I mention EQ once in a while.
