Hey.

Unsure of the exact spawn time, but I have a monk with an EB Ornate Shell
Necklace that I threw on and camped this Gobby with, for a Cleric friend in
the hope it could be MQed. Yes, he does pop in that tower, and he spawns
right beside Deep (Female DE NPC for the Monk epic). There's also 3 other
Gobbys that spawn there on a much faster spawn time, whereas this PH was
like about 20-30 mins. The PH is the one you need to whack as he spawns. I
sat on the wall above him and waited. I found it a good idea to take the 3
Gobbys as they spawn though, because some spawn as Healers and heal your
target if you don't get away far enough. The tainted Gobby also spawned in
there, but I can't remember if he was a PH for Bergergle or just a normal
spawn.

Hope that helps ya :)
