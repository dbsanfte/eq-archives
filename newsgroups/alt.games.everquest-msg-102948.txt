From Henry VI part 2. Jack Cade is a pretender to the throne who plots a
revolution to empower the people. (Though the people he's most
interested in empowering consist of Jack Cade, can possibly his mom.)

Dick and Smith are two of his henchmen, in on the plotting of the
revolt. The famous line in question is actually uttered by one of said
henchmen.

JACK CADE.
Valiant I am. 

SMITH [aside].
'A must needs; for beggary is valiant. 

JACK CADE.
I am able to endure much. 

DICK [aside].
No question of that; for I have seen him whipp'd three market-days
together. 

JACK CADE.
I fear neither sword nor fire. 

SMITH [aside].
He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof. 

DICK [aside].
But methinks he should stand in fear of fire, being burnt i' th'hand for
stealing of sheep. 

JACK CADE.
Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vows reformation. There
shall be in England seven half-penny loaves sold for a penny: the
three-hoop'd pot shall have ten hoops; and I will make it felony to
drink small beer: all the realm shall be in common; and in Cheapside
shall my palfrey go to grass: and when I am king,- as king I will be,- 

ALL.
God save your majesty! 

JACK CADE.
I thank you, good people:- there shall be no money; all shall eat and
drink on my score; and I will apparel them all in one livery, that they
may agree like brothers, and worship me their lord. 

DICK.
The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers. 

JACK CADE.
Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin
of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? that parchment, being
scribbled o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings: but I say,
'tis the
bee's wax; for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own
man since.- How now! who's there? 

.... and so on.
