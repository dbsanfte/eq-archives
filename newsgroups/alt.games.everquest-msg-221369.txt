There are two types of begging.  One is asking the other players
in the game to give you cash, gear, buffs, or help you out in
other ways where there's no mutual benefit.  This will have two
negative effects; one, most people will hate you with the fury of
a white hot sun for doing it, because its not just you doing it,
its hundreds of people like you, and worse, hundreds of people
with a lot of experience in the game pretending to be like you
and doing it.  All that slow boil of despite gets aimed at every
new begger, and yet redoubles in its intensity for the next one. 
Two, if you -do- get the help you are pathetically begging for,
then you haven't earned it, and you don't learn to play your
character well from the beginning, instead you learn to lean on a
crutch that won't be there later, essentially crippling
yourself.  And the first few levels are a great deal of fun and
free of risk, there's no reason to beg for ways to get thru them
faster and up into the realm where death means losing your gear
and losing experience you've earned.

The second type of begging is using the in game skill, similar to
fishing and tailoring and so forth.  Its relatively harmless; you
won't ever make any real money at it, the best I've heard of is
someone who could get a silver piece off mobs every now and
then... and by the time you've managed to get your skill up that
high you almost certainly are at the point where you are
destroying silver pieces you loot just to save weight.  But what
-can- happen when you fail a beg attempt is that the mob you are
begging from can turn and attack you.  This is generally a "bad
thing".  But if you are fighting in a group and you are the one
who is supposed to get hit, this is a nice little extra hate
generator.  So why not beg, then?  Because the odds of you
failing are higher when your skill is low... and the more you
practice the higher your skill gets.  Don't use it except when
you need it, and your skill in it will stay nice and low for a
long time to come.
