Spell was already useless even before SOE gave everyone 200 in sense
skill.  It's so stupidly easy to get skill up in sense, just make it
hotkey and adjust the keys in option so that hotkey is same as
direction.  You get sense everytime you turn or move.  Free to use, no
mana to use, no spell to buy.

I think dwarves were the only one that originally started with 200 in
sence.
