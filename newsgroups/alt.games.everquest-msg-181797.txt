    I didnt really solo mine until the 40's, something I now regret (not for
anything I've lost except the playing experience of having soloed an SK
lower). I think it would've been fun, but I had a huge number of
opportunities to group until then, and had read online guides that
repeatedly stated that SK's couldn't solo. Anyway, I found it extremely
difficult in my 40's to solo, didn't ever get killed but had many near
misses, but as soon as I hit 49 and got that magic 42 second fear spell, and
the lovely 60% snare / 300dmg dot, I've found it to be an extremely
comfortable and empowering experience :)

    Actually I tell a lie, I used to solo lizards in feerott in my early
30's for darkforge pieces - found it heartbreakingly hard, no fear kiting
really viable, and many bare-thread victories. Only two deaths but more than
one heart-pounding escape with a sow potion :) This was the only time I
found most SK spells actually useful - stacking the dots and using every
single debuff/tap spell I had was the only thing that let me ever win a
battle.

    The other thing I discovered in my 40's was c3 :) I dont even like to
group without it anymore, and wouldn't dream of soloing. As a tank / melee
fear kiter we do NOT get much opportunity to med and our spells do consume a
heavy dose of mana.

    Anyway, pre-49 I found the 18 second fear to be extremely difficult to
use effectively. Yes you can learn to count how many swings between
fear-casts but the instant you get that wrong you're up for casting a
loooong cast fear spell through a mob beating on you - interrupts are common
(more than just 15).

    Only other useful bit of info I may have is that although I play in
australia on a US server (not the best timezone combo), I've almost never
had trouble finding a group. I think SK's are actually a popular class for
groups - and grouping can be fun, although I'm a bit over it at the moment.

Cheers,
James
