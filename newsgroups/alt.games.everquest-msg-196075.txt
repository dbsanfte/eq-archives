I used to use it, but they broke it a long time ago.  I quit using it
after a patch where it started crashing my OS (Win2k) when I would
select a different server and try to log back in.  It never was all
that useful tho, if you're going out to server select you might as
well go all the way and reboot, doesn't take too much longer and you
clear the damned memory leaks.
