Sure it was NK? Ryshon Hunsti (sic) is the starting NPC for the
Ghoulbane (with quest items named Hilt of Nobility and Blade of
Nobility) quest, he's on the shore in West Karana usually. Ghoulbane
is a Paladin only 1hs weapon.

From what I hear/read, sounds like the quest may currently be broken
(Kanthuk Ogrebane in BB appears with ! in front of his name and
possibly doesn't complete the conversation) - couple that with the
fact they're looking closely at making the Ghoulbane NO DROP, I'd just
pass up on this quest now.
