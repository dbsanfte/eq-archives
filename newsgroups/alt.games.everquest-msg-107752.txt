You think that rogues are underpowered???

Let's see... Backstab makes them useless since they can only use it solo,
hide/sneak suck because everything sees through it when they try to get
their corpse. (note: sarcasm)

SK's are the best tanks in the new CT (unless they fixed that taunt bug last
patch) with their dots.

Pally's make the best dragon pullers/engagers because they can DA and get
AoE positioning under control first.

Mages, well...  they can CoH me... uhh... and I like focus items... ok, no
arguments here.
