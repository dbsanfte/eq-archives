Not only that, quite a few of these trade items have been nerfed for
quite awhile. Baking fish fillets for plat was nerfed when Verant
spotted people running around in full plate on Sullon Zek when the
server was 3 days old because there were literally HUNDREDS of people
doing nothing but making fish fillets. They simply lowered the price
that vendors would pay, and halved the resulting number of fillets
given by the recipe. What do you bet that old, out of date info is
still listed in these silly plat guides?
