And don't forget the Chanter Pets. Even tho they are paper thin and
can't tank much if you are fearing it doesn't matter. Chanter pets are
good at offense and do good damage they just suck at defense. Especially
if the chanters hastes his pet.

Fear, snare, 2 pets, mmmm good. And for those mobs you can't fear the
chanter can also
cast a damage shield Feedback on the Necros pet.

Chanter can stack their suffocate line of Dots with the necro now.
