Myself and some friends were thinking of taking a look around Howling
Stones.
Does anyone have any nightmare stories to tell me about the place before we
go in?
Our group at the moment consists of Paladin 51, Monk 52, Chanter 51, Cleric
51, Shaman 50, and Druid 52.
I have been told already that a high-level tank is absolutely necessary, and
I have a level 60 paladin who will help us, but that means leaving someone
else out, which we dont wanna do.
Please give me the wisdom of your experiences.
