"Pussy" is used more as an anatomical reference than every other usage 
combined.  You knew how it would be taken when you chose it, regardless of 
alternate meaning.  You tried to be slick and get away with a double 
entendre, and you got stomped for it.  Stop whining and trying to sea-lawyer 
your way out of it.

While there is a sexual connotation to bush, the common meaning is a 
reference to vegitation.  What's the common meaning to pussy?  If you say 
anything but a vagina, then you're not being honest.

I will lose all respect for Blizzard if they overturn your ass-kicking.

I beta-tested and played EQ2.  While it may be a better game, if you're 
going to EQ2 just because you're upset that you were asked to pay the price 
for your stupidity... well, then WoW is the better for it.

You don't deserve anything better.
