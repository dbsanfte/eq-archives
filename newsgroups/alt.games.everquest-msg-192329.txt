Nope monk nerf was not pre-KEI, used to duo my monk with a druid who
was gating back to the nexus for KEI each night before we played.
Course I didnt have a fungi though and my most uber gear was just
acrylia and a TE War Maul. Used to watch wizzies clear Spirocs with
KEI while we worked 5 spawn. Oh yeah monks were like so overpowered.
BTW brought my 49 bard in and cleared em without KEI just to piss em
off.
