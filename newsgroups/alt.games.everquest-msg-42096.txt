That has certainly gone a long way to explain the hostility people feel
towards the US in the Middle East. Keeping Saddam in power and the
population crushed under sanctions is *exactly* the opposite of what it
should have been done, which was to depose Saddam (infinitely easier to
track down and eliminate than Osama Bin Laden), and then flood the
country with aid and American business investment.

It is a cultural war, and Coca-cola, McDonalds, Levi's and MTV are our
most powerful weapons, infinitely more so than Tomahawk missiles.
