Where the hell did you get the idea I thought these things were bad for
raiders? LAY OFF THE CRACK!
Youve gone from your point being that the changes were total crap to "not
improvement" and "not bad", "in many cases".

Im perfectly capable of telling the difference between bad for you and bad
for EQ players in general, problem is YOU lumped it together.

I'm not interested in this conspiracy theory of yours. Calling me stupid is
a very weak, very ineffective argument. The post I replied to is at the
bottom, support it or you admit you cant.

IT WAS YOUR POINT! Lie all you like, takes a few clicks to go back up the
thread & read your post.
The changes you list dont favor casuals over any other player, and they
arent bad for the game.

Your post is at the bottom, I suggest you read it, even though I'm pretty
sure you'll send more personal attacks instead of supporting it.
Bottom line: you included the bazaar in a list of things that were total
crap for the game, which were put in due to casual powergamer whining. YOUR
WORDS.

In the paragraph above, you reverse yourself, and admit you just have a
casual and apparently inexplicable dislike of the bazaar, but that it was a
good thing for raiders & casuals alike (vast majority, anyways) and didnt
harm the game, except in your opinion. Point conceded.

The bazaar wasnt put in because some casual somewhere whined about selling
in EC, and it wasnt crap for the game.

More Sisson lies, more likely. You claimed changes for the casuals were
total crap for the game. Go back & reread your own post, fool.

Since personal attacks are your only argument, stoney idiocy is a good

I'm glad you're annoyed, but its persistence that bothers you, not

I inferred that you implied. What's your point? That implication is beyond
your teensy little rat brain?

Havent screwed up yet. At least not in this conversation. Your proof is at

Doesn't answer the question Ben, and its bullshit, none of the people I play
with have ever asked for a level 65 time geared toon to be waiting for them
next time they log on. I know you want them to shut up, but WHY SHOULD THEY
CARE ABOUT YOUR OPINION?

No actually Sony did the occasional poll, and they tried to guess what would
make the majority happy. Obvious if you're not a fuckwit.

I do talk out of my ass occasionally, unlike you I'll try to support my
opinions, or at least admit that they were only opinions.

Actually, I went back & verified is what I did. You can too if you like.

Yeah. Sufficiently intelligent to prove you wrong also, but that doesnt

I'm smart enough, I'm also smart enough to make points that arent 99%
personal attack. You claimed changes done for casuals were total crap for
the game, yet you wont even try to prove it. Is it beyond your capability?

Your post is at the bottom Ben, first two sentences pretty much sum it up.

Responsibilty, yes, for a few of them, all the rest is bullshit.

Raider can put in a few hours over several days in not very challenging
encounters & receive an item far beyond what will take me days to earn.
That's bullshit.
I would just join a guild like everyone else, except that I work nights on a
compressed shift. As a result, I cant progress past a certain point without
unreasonable effort, and neither can 5 other people who grouped with me from
work, all of whom quit EQ awhile after GOD came out. The ONE guy from our
shift who got an elemental flag suffered enormously to do so, then quit
because he claimed raiding sucked, it was boring as hell, and that he had
more fun back when he was trying to one and a half group dragons & luclin
mobs & such with us. If EQ had had a better system in place for casuals to
advance, my friends would still be playing. We didnt whine for it, and it
never happened. SO HOW THE HELL ARE CASUALS BEING APPEASED? We put in
similar time & effort, but get nothing due to circumstance. We hit what we
felt was a brick wall. I chat with your "resposible" raiders while theyre
raiding. It takes time, true, but the rest is bullshit. Little effort, less
skill, no investment except the time, and the only risk is that the fuckwit
who wiped you started watching tv 10 seconds before he should have.
/autofollow, /consent, how they get there & how they leave.

I know the latest greatest raids take effort, and a few old raids are
complicated, but the other 90% of it is cruise control, except for a small
handful of critical players.

Dont remember ever claiming you said the second. Stop making shit up Ben.
I didnt say you claimed the changes only helped casuals, I said that you
claimed they were done on whiney casual powergamer's behalf.
Youre nitpicking bullshit, Ben. Name a few changes to the game done directly
to benefit casuals, which didnt benefit the vast majority of EQ players,
which have been "total crap for the game." You tried before, but you missed.

Every point is bullshit, wasnt done for "whiney casuals" and wasnt total
crap for the game, except in your opinion, which luckily SOE doesnt give a
shit about. Theyre listening to the other 99.99% of the players, and
splitting the bullshit out of the legit gripes. "I like long frustrating
cross country runs with 18 zonings, 2 boat rides, and 3 linkdeaths"
bullshit. "I LOVE hell levels, leveling should take 200% longer" bullshit.
"An entire expansion's content should require druid/wizard to get you there
& back" bullshit. They fixed those problems, admittedly poorly, and theyll
continue to fix things whether you like it or not. Their income depends on
it. If they dont keep their game less frustrating & more entertaining, they
lose business. Fucking obvious, but youve got to build a conspiracy around
the whiney powergamer's incredible authority and claim EQ life was perfected
back in the year 1998, or whenever it came out.

Why the hell should casuals be satisfied with EQ as is? It's pretty much the
best out there, but it still sucks in many ways.
How the hell should they show their appreciation? In your opinion, by
shutting up, but thats not showing appreciation, thats preparing to cancel
your account.

I think you've got em beat in the worst blight category, but youre nowhere

the grand prize.

Your quote says it all, sling insults until I give up trying to reason with
you, then claim the last word. Nice strategy. You even tried to bribe me
with monopoly money to get me to quit, how cute.
