Have to disagree on the shaman not being a good partner for a druid.  I have
a RL friend who has a level 46 shammy. He says that druids are one of the
only classes that he can partner with and be effective. He said that a
druid/shaman combo rocks. Probably mostly because of Snare - shammies get
excellent DoT's, but when root breaks things can get ugly. I didn't ask him
for a whole lot of details because my druid is only level 16. :-)
