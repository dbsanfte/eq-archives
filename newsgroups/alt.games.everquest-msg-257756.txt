You don't get xp when link dead, you also do get the xp redistributed to
everyone since it is split among the people there. If you are talking about
LDON points, the only way to get points when LD is to return before the
adventure is won. If you are not there on the win you do not get points and
you get a failure. So unless they go LD and time it right to come back the
get nothing but a loss by going LD..............
