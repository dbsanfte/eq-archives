Lots of people are recommending monk/shaman which is cool...but keep in mind
the downside....

People bugging you for buffs.  Hell, even if strangers don't, your wife will
be.  Oddly enough, people seem to think that the more spell gems they have,
the better, which means a lot of spell swapping.  Screw that crap, give 'em
a couple buffs and tell 'em to deal with it. :)
