Thanks all for the feedback. I was kind of expecting that the gig was 
going to be a necessity for EQ2. This game and WoW will be the first new 
titles I've run on this machine in a year. I think at this point all 
newer games are able to take advantage of additional RAM on video cards 
if you have more then 128 MB. So hopefully being able to cache twice as 
many textures will help performance somewhat too where I've got 256 MB 
on the video card.

There was a discount offer for Kingston RAM in the EQ2 box that's valid 
until June 2005 I think it is. I went to their site and it turns out 
that you can select RAM specifically for your system manufacturer and 
model for many systems, including mine. Although their prices are high, 
with the 40% discount I can get it from them about as cheaply as I could 
get something similar from say Crucial at newegg.com. So I think I will 
do that right after Christmas, which will bring total RAM to 1.5 gigs on 
my machine. That should do the trick nicely until I can spring for a new 
system in the Summer.

Somebody asked since when does HP use ASUS motherboards. I don't know 
really but my Pavilion 540n is about 3 years old I think now. When I got 
it, it came with cheapo onboard video and sound, a 1.6 P4 processor and 
one hard disk. But it only cost me $500. off the shelf at my local 
CompUSA and was easily upgraded. HP makes nice systems for the money at 
retail. For under a grand total cost I was able to put together a decent 
gaming rig that's lasted a few years.

For my next system I am considering one of three options:
1.) Do the same thing again with an HP system and upgrade it for gaming
2.) Build my own from scratch buying all components I need from newegg
3.) Spring for a top of the line Alienware PC

Decisions, decisions... lol
