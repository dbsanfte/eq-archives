    I actually thought about putting a line in directly talking to you, as I
knew you'd reply to that. ;-)

    You kill whatever is tougher than the gods, which can be named whatever
the hell they decide to name it. I stopped looking for a coherent storyline
or roleplaying when Luclin came out. In Luclin, the storyline was impossible
to figure out from in-game clues except for in ONE place - Inner Acrylia.
And we know how much of a cock-up that was. Luclin was also the expansion
when faction ceased to matter. So run around, kill whatever you like, there
is no story - hmm, sounds more like a video game than anything that should
have "RPG" in the title.

    Now look at the next few releases. PoP - storyline? Only available to
those that get to the top of the raid chain, although they do have some good
backstory for all the OLDER. Faction? You're kidding, right? I can think of
two faction situations in all of PoP. In HoH, there's a faction that drops
to max KOS in a few kills. But as long as you haven't killed anything there,
you're invisible, and you have the right race/class/religion, you can scout
the zone with impunity (the see invis mobs start non-KOS). In Storms, you
have to kill enough giants before Askr will deal with you, so you can't just
loot the pieces of the BoT access quest and get in without fighting. In both
places, faction is used as game mechanic and not as a roleplaying
opportunity.

    LoY? No improveable faction that I saw in Gunthak, Dulak, or Nadox. Very
little NPC dialogue outside of the lighthouse quest givers, who give little
more than "I need this No Drop item, um, because" text. Roleplaying? Nope,
pure video game. Go there, kill whatever cons blue, sell the phat lewts in
The Bazaar.

    So given that there's no reason for players to expect a coherent
storyline, why bother with one? As long as the mobs look neat, the fight is
challenging to figure out, and the lewt is phat, everything will be fine.

    James
