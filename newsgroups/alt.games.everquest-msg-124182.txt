Based on Microsoft's reputation in security, you aren't alone.

The EQ patcher patches itself by initiating an HTTP transaction to the 
patcher server (can't remember which IP) on port 7000 or above (again, I 
can't remember exactly which port but I seem to remember it being above 
7000, your firewall may tell you these details). So you will need to 
specify a firewall rule allowing outbound TCP (SYN) connections to this 
IP (or all IPs if you don't know the IP) on ports 7000-8000 (unless you 
find out the exact port). I allow all outbound SYN connections on high 
ports in my firewall anyway so I don't need this rule, you might want to 
do the same if you are comfortable with it.

If your firewall is blocking UDP then you will need to specify another 
rule allowing UDP in both directions between you and the EQ server you 
play on (mine, Saryrn, is 63.241.42.185, but you should allow the whole 
of 63.241.42.0/24 if you don't know which server it is, although the 
European servers probably aren't on this subnet).

Once these are in place your firewall should stop bugging you. Next time 
I play I'll have another look at exactly what IPs and ports are being 
used so I can be more specific.
