Well, my point was that some resentment may be based on the disparity 
between the haves and the have-nots. The guy who doesn't have a lot of 
disposable income wants to compete with the guy who does. If it were just a 
matter of grinding out crafting levels and making money in game, THAT he 
could do and on that playing field he could win. But in the real world money 
doesn't come that easily, it's far harder to earn and in that race he is 
disadvantaged and therefore resentful.
