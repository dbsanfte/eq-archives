I wouldn't take places in all four lines, that was a rhetorical hypothetical
to test the limits of this idea. But I don't see any moral issue with
hedging the bet on two lines in order to minimize the effect of randomness,
and my wife and I have done this on occasion. When the first person reaches
the front of the line, the other person exits the second line and frees up a
spot for everyone. It doesn't strike me as being more of "putting myself
above others" than is taking a spot in line to begin with. By simply taking
a spot in line, you are by definition putting yourself above the guy behind
you. By investing another person in the effort, you pay a slight fee (two
people have to wait instead of one, forgoing a good popcorn opportunity) and
the return is that you minimize your downside. If you pay for two lottery
tickets, you earn two chances at the jackpot. What is it about this practice
that you think requires "justification"?
