That's because the exercise is contrived in such a way not
to match the real world.

Both of your ideas are likely to result in LA being a cloud

disarm the bomb, from either the bomb site or the control
centre or to damage the bomb in such a way that the rather
fragile fission-fusion mechanism won't work.
