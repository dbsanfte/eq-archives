I think Ankylbyter is cute and I don't think its in violation.  You on Tholuxe
Paells?  
I don't think your character would have degraded so long as he wasn't online.
There isn't any way to get your stuff back in a "second" and no one has any
cheat codes.
I don't think anyone's offended.  (How do I say this without offending *you*?)
I have heard this story 100 times from 100 people.  While I totally believe
what you have said, most of these turn out to be cases of someone else on your
account.  Matter of fact, all of them did...
 Now it COULD be a really great hacker but who would go to the trouble to hack
a level 13 not uber character?
Sorry you lost your stuff....
