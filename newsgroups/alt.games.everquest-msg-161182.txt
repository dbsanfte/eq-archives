Appears that maybe you did a bit of creative rounding - 25 bucks
versus 29.95 and the like. I *could* get the individual pieces for 25
bucks each, but still have to pay S&H for mail order. No place
anywhere near sells any of them for less than 29.95 except the
barebones original EQ. From what I hear, the Gold version runs from
$60 to $70. Not quite as bad as $90, but you then still have to pay
the 12.95/mo to play.

Are there any other games out there that cost that much to play?
Anything close? A $49.95 one-time investment with no monthly fee isn't
close, either. Btw, I wouldn't even consider any of the games coming
out for $59.95 or more. I think they're getting out of hand.
