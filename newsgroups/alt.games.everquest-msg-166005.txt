 Happy Thanksgiving!  One of my favorite recipes................


BAKED STUFFED TURKEY

10 lb. turkey
1 cup melted butter
1 cup stuffing (Pepperidge Farm is fine)
1 cup uncooked popcorn (ORVILLE REDENBACHER'S LOW FAT)
salt/pepper to taste

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush turkey well with melted butter, salt, and
pepper. Fill cavity with stuffing and popcorn. Place in baking pan with the
neck end toward the back of the oven. Listen for the popping sounds. When
the turkey's ass blows the oven door open and the turkey flies across the
room, it's done

Frog, The Fatman of Love

Native American Prayer
"Hold on to what is good even if it is a handful of earth.
Hold on to what you believe even if it is a tree which stands by itself.
Hold on to what you must do even if it is a long way from here.
Hold on to life even when it is easier letting go.
Hold on to my hand even when I have gone away from you."
