Every time I get wiped out I turn off AAXP till I get a few kills below
level 55. At that point I switch over to 100% to keep myself capped at level
54. I know AAXP is meant to be much easier to acquire at 60 but there are a
few other mitigating circumstances for me, ie:

Only have one 55 spell at the moment and it isn't the good Augumentation
one. Once I get the Aug' I will be levelling to 55 and coasting there for a
while instead.

I like empty zones or at least quiet zones to experiment in - the less
collateral damage and less witnesses to some of the more idiotic endeavours
the better. Being on Legends it would be hard finding a top end zone which
is as quiet.

I am still a pretty piss poor 54 necro, once I feel comfortable at this
level I will start forging ahead again.
