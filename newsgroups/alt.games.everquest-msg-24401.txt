Thats what he *said*, surely?

[ quote following paragraphs ]

        They were in Lake of Ill Manners (sic) levelling up.                    
                                                                                
        The simple truth is that no one goes after this stuff because it is not 
worth the trouble for anyone who can get EP for doing it.  Going after Lord     
Pickclaw while he's blue would require as much effort as a Kael raid requires   
for my guild, and the loot just isn't worth the trip.
