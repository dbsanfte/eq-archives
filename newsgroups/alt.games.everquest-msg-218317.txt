I too am curious.  I don't see what the draw for Davis is/was.  One
can only blame the economy for so much, the rest comes from government
interference, of which there has been plenty the last few years.

I think Arnold at least has business sense going for him, something
Davis certainly did not.  It's also nice to at least have the
possibility of someone who is altruistic in their public service
endeavor.  After all, he's already wealthy so it's not money.  He
can't be president, so it's not political advancement.  What else
could it be?  I'm hoping a true desire to make things better.
