Sort of the opposite of the title of the thread, isn't it?

But they did do this last winter, the... hmm, started with a D. 
Defeat?  Despite?  Grr, I forget, anyway, they had an almost HC server
set up as an event.  It was a PvP server, where you could attack
anyone over level 6, and anyone at all outside the newbie zones (much
to the surprise of people who like to level up in NRo).  Death from
either player OR mob meant waking up at zero exp next to your
guildleader, naked, with a fresh set of newbie gear and nothing  in
the bank.

I say "almost HC" because you kept your name and starting stats unless
you backed out and deleted, and your lootable body was still out there
with whatever you'd accumulated on it... unless you were killed by a
player, in which case he (and I think ONLY he) could loot it.

Oh, and also you got points for killing other players based on their
level, and if you died you got to keep the points.

I actually had quite a lot of fun playing with this, although I didn't
enjoy the PvP part, the Hardcore part was a nice departure from a game
where a standard newbie tactic is to kill things till out of mana,
then die rather than waste time medding with no meditation skill. 
Knowing that once I hit level 6 I was just a big fat target for the
level 9's out there... well I did make it all the way to 8 once I
think...  well anyway, I got bored with the idea before they closed
the server down.

I think I would be interested in a "blue" HC server, although I'd like
it even a little less HC, leave the stuff in the bank, as an
"inheritance".  And let me access it and loot the body even if I
change characters.  Trouble with the server as they did it is that
only a small portion of the population are into PvP, and only a small
portion of the population are interested in Hardcore, so you end up
with only the intersection of the two... well the current PvP servers
are already the least populated in the game, running a server for just
the 300 or so who'd be interested in one that's BOTH doesn't seem cost
effective.
