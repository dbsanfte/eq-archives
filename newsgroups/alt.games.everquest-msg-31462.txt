ya know one of the MOST under utilised spell a shaman has is their "blind"
range of spells. Effectively blind = fear. So its:
DOT, Blind, DOT, rise and repeat as needed until level 34.
then after 34 its
DOT, Blind, DOT, /pet no taunt, /pet attack

Blind doesnt last long so you need to refresh it a few times. If you hiting
on the critter when you cast blind, take a few steps back, then it will
start running off, you will recieve a message telling you the spell wore
out, so you can just reapply it.

Hope it helps

Ben
