The path I have gone down is.

Played UO for over a year

Tried AO for a couple of months, hated there customer services, wasn't 
sure the game could handle big groups.

Tried WWiiO again for a few months, didn't like the ranking system and 
lag in actual battles was a killer. But found the game very immersive. 
Again gave up after a couple of months

Tried DAoC actually loved the feel of it, the interface, 
graphics,grouping etc are awesome. However the place does not feel 
bigger enough and the tendancy to fight in one area was getting very 
tedious. Also the dungeons were very small. I lasted 3 months in DAoC 
and will keep an eye on it. Very very strongly level based. Seem to 
spend all my time levelling and not being able to play with higher 
levels.

I've now been playing EQ for just over a week. The game feels more 
'right' more like a virtual world. The towns are bigger etc. Still miss 
just simple parts of a virtual world like having a council room with 
chairs that you can sit on and horses stabled to the side and people 
just chatting. However the world is large and I am sure will keep me 
interested. Certainly having fun at the moment.

I also have returned to UO for the more rpg part of the game. Just the 
simple chats around a table etc  Ceased to be worried about the level of 
my char in UO,

So playing UO and EQ and seeing how I get on.

My 2 cents

Miles
