And this puzzles me a bit. My understanding is that TL requires a spell
component which must be purchased. I'm thinking that when I bought them
for my cousin's wiz who isn't well liked in the Temple of Sol Ro, I paid
slightly more than a plat each. Whilst being able to port with no
significant loss of my time might make me a bit more inclined to say yes
to a request, I think if I had to provide reagents I'd want to be
reimbursed for them, at least if I did it very often. I mean, a plat
isn't much; but if you do it for 20 strangers a day, it could really add
up over time.
