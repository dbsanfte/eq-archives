come on!  you can't compare the situations hoping to find the answer.. to do
so is ridiculous.

its totally senseless to think "the big one up their ass" is what set
japanese society straight!  that's just stupid and senseless!
what kind of reasoning is that based on?!  there's NOTHING supporting your
ridiculous statements.

>  Why do we *not* see any fine goods come out of the Pali's lands
> like we do from the Swiss, Germany, Japan, India, Pakistan etc ??

the state of a country can't be judged by looking at the level/quality of
products it produces!  WTF!

The Palestinians are commiting "terrorism" as a reaction to the greater
"terrorism" committed by Isreal.
All "terrorism" is horrible, but for the argument's sake, we'll consider the
levels.  1000+ palestinians have been killed, both directly and indirectly,
by Isreali oppression towards the Palestinians.  There's just no excuse for
that.  Isreal is VIOLATING the rules reagarding human rights set forth by
the U.N.

You really need to stop swallowing what mainstream american media is feeding
you.
Stop this senseless, ignorant preaching.  You base your argument on
assumptions.
Try some real reasearch and reasoning.
