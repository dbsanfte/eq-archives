Absolutely gimpy.  We were waaaay overpowered for him, and he's only level 
60.  I know he dropped the bracer, and we now have a warrior pulling with 
fireballs.  Not sure what else he dropped, as I logged shortly after the 
kill.

I'm not sure I like having it spawn toooo often.  Epics are rare, and 
should take a lot of work to get too.  At least if you keep him hidden 
away, it's possible that he will be up for more than a minute or two 
sometimes.  The undead bard was up while we were waiting to kill Trak, and 
we couldn't find a bard online on the entire server who needed him, though 
that probably has more to do with the perceived usefulness of the epics.  
(Yes, the bard epic is incredibly useful, however guilds rarely focus 
their entire effort on getting bard epics.  Being more efficient is one 
thing, but fast and painless CR is absolutely required for high-end 
raiding.)
