I'm sorry they gave you such a brush off.  a couple of years ago,
because of having the quit button so near the delete button my son
deleted his character.  He was talking and didn't pay attention to the
warning windows.  Petitions and email did nothing till I contacted the
business office and said that they were going to lose two accounts
over this.  They restored my son's character.  It seems money talked.
