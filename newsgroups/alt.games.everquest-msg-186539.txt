Hmmm, if the offer is "right", Id be willing to "transfer ownership"
of my  2 accounts and all its trappings, amongst which are included :
65 warrior, 65 cleric, 65 necro, 65 wizzie - all maxed!

But then again, that is illegal and against the EULA; so who wuld risk
paying lots of money for something which is nothing but a high risk
venture?

... then I'd have to either find another outlet for my inherent EQ
fix; or contact Sony and prove my original ownership of product to
requench my thirst with MY Uber Quartet!

IF you still seek the attempt to throw money at some virtual Everquest
sales situation, you can head to www.playersauction.com; and play
financial roulette there.

Otherwise, start a charachter from level 1; research all the
voluminous online poop, and become an effective "player". (Those that
"buy" thier toons and attempt to emmerse themselves ingame, tend to
stand out like the Jolly Green Giant in a hen house.

Peace and Happy Hunting
