Not quite true.  All of the spells formerly obtained via the OOW runes
can be crafted by players using the spell research skill.  Likewise all
the spells that used to require PoP ethereal parchments and such, or
that used to require LDoN points.

Other than that, spells that could already be crafted using the old
"rune of this" and "words of that" random drops, are now crafted using
the new research system where the only dropped component is a parchment
(or papyrus or whatever) used for ALL spells of a given level, plus
assorted vendor-sold bits.

Spells that were obtained only via quests (such as Temperance), or only
as mob drops (such as Spirit of Eagle), still cannot be crafted.  And
neither can melee tomes, dammit.
