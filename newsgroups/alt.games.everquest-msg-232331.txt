Since I am rarely the puller or MA, I often end up as ML. If I'm the group's
slower and haster, then I opt out of ML because in that case I'll be pretty
busy, managing my warder and joining the melee as well as casting regularly.
But that's the exception.

When I am either ML or groupleader, I now insist on full clarity on the NBG
question, I won't enter the dungeon without it. This is because I've learned
the hard way that players can have two different ideas of "need before
greed". One is simply eligible classes roll, the other is "if its an
upgrade." I find the second one unworkable for pickup groups, and hence I
now more openly lobby for "all roll on all items". Life is too short, roll
it up troops, next! Recently I've been finding more players coming to the
same conclusion.

(LDoN regulars pass on a lot of augs anyway, because we have more useful
augs than gear spots to put them. I haven't rolled on a resist aug for at
least 50 adventures now, and obviously never bothered with INT or CHA ones
in the first place, so I'm passing on the augs a majority of the time
regardless of the loot rules in place.)


P.S. Attacking-pet classes have a useful little advantage as ML in LDON
dungeons, where corpses can sometimes be untargetable, in a wall, etc. The
pet retains the last corpse as a target until sicced on something new, so I
can always /assist the warder and then /loot a corpse even if I can't click
on it directly.
