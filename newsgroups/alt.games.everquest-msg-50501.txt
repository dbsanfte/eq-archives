The Cleric in our group mentioned last night that she was interested in
obtaining a shield.  I would guess that items like the Crystal Webshield,
etc., would fit in this category.

What can a group of 5-6 members, levels 33-35 obtain for her?  Recently it's
been:

Cleric
Chanter
Chanter / Druid
Warrior
Mage / Wiz
Rogue

I think the Rogue is out of town for a few days, though.  Our group has an
awesome rapport and we work like ( ugh, I'm going to type it... ) a
"well-oiled machine".
