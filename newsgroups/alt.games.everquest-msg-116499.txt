Most peoples problems with it is the use of the d00d language (although I
prefer to call it nettw@t myself). I generally still sow people who come up
to me and say "Sow Plz" but I am always more friendly to people who at least
try and construct a sentence - if they throw in a couple of "thee"s and
"thou"s then so much the better. It takes no time at all to create a button
that asks a druid nicely to SOW them, and just click on it when required,
but some people are of the attitude that if they can't be arsed to write
please out in full then why should we bother to sow them. I have had people
com up to me and demand SOW as if it is my duty to grant it, I have had
people who have got quite rude when I have been unable to SOW because I am
OOM or busy (yes I am going to stop in the middle of a battle to SOW them as
they are in a hurry). Some people don't seem to understand that being polite
makes people more willing to spend their time and effort to help them (and
they don't even have to actually spend much effort on doing it as they can
ajust program it to a button and use it many times)
