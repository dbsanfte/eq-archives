    That is exactly why these RoF-style encounters will become the wave of
the future: they keep people busy forever. You're forced to endure all the
waves - no bypassing content for j00! - if you want to get to the loot at
the end. Compare this with a standard boss mob, where you clear to the mob,
kill the mob, move on, or even worse in VI's eyes CotH PAST all the clearing
nonsense and just engage the mob you're there to kill in the first place. If
all raid encounters were standard bosses, guilds would clear them all in no
time and be left with nothing to do - like they were in Velious. The problem
is that these ring-style encounters demand players to commit huge blocks of
time to take them, and a lot of players just can't, or won't, do it. The
easiest way to get my guild down to half its numbers fast is to announce
we're going to do a ring-style encounter - "Gotta sleep", "Better go finish
that project", "Tonight's my shower night! Bye!"
