At lvl 52 I killed Sea Furies quite well

Go to the North of Sea Fury Isle on the coast nearest AC isle, there is a
outcropping into the sea. I pull to here for the added space.

Buff up and cast your best pet, give it a dagger to enable duel wield.
Change to Air Elemental form and take a drink from the good supply of 10
shot sow potions. Alternatively you can nip over to AC isle and swap a
clarity for sow from teh 12 year old druid camping AC to get Ring so he can
charge people for MQ
Med up
Cast Haste on pet and beserker str

Float out to isle and find a sea fury to pull that is out of aggro range on
others. There are always one or two wandering near the front of your pull
area. Cast tash and run back.

When you reach your pull spot start clicking immobolize to root it. Slow it
and then apply your DoT. Run up to it so it slaps you once so pet starts
whacking, Back off and reapply beserker str to yor pet as it fades. Pet will
slaughter the Sea Fury. Rinse Repeat. Gives reasonable exp at 52. You can
also offer to partner with others soloing there to increase kill rate
