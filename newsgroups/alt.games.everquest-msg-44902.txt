^^^^^^^^^^
Get some cheap junk AGI items and/or AGI buffs.  And then go get hit,
ALOT.

AGI affects how fast you learn Defense skill.
DEX affects how fast you lean Offense/Melee skills.

Once you cap both sets of skills, get rid of all AGI/DEX giving items
that doesn't also give AC, hps, and/or resists.
