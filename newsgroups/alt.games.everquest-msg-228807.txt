And how does a bandaid two years after a brutal mike tyson style beating 
equate to giving monks something other than jack shit -when they 
destroyed them_ (emphasis mine)?

Two years later is not simultaneous, heck, I'd even have given it to you 
if it had been the very next patch.  OK, we broke you, here's a lollipop 
to keep you quiet.

Not that lull is going to put monks back up to their previous position, 
or even back up to rough parity with other classes who can offer lull 
-plus- real utility (Cheals, MT, haste, 50 seperate functions) or FD 
plus real utility (MT, DPS)

A similar offer to mages would be to give us a summoned Improved Heal 
item; a distration from the amazing reaming going on at the other end.
