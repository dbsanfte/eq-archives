I logged in yesterday and started from Ruins of Everfrost tundra.
It taked about 10 seconds and someone send a tell to me
that "ruins are camped, u can't hunt there" what was weird
to me because nobody haven't told me before that ruins are
camped!? Well i send a tell back to this aggro hunter something
like "what? are you serious?" and she told me that
"yes it's camped you can only med there.." and i told her
"ok! you can keep it!". I wonder because nothing really spawns
at the ruins that place is only used for pulling.. and nobody
haven't told me before even there have been like 6 of us that
ruins are camped! Well tell me guys am i wrong or right here?
