I think I'll agree here.
At the moment my server (AB) has about 4 or 5 guilds (might be more, not
sure) capable of doing ST. When the largest (not the best) of the lot got
enough Primals for their guild they simply did all 4 and woke Kerafyrm.
I've heard from several of the other uberguilds now that especially primal
1hs drops have decreased to almost nill and that they were lucky to get the
weapons they have.
