I play a dwarf paladin about once per week with real life friends.
She is almost level 13, and primarily uses a fine steel long sword
given to her by a friend.  I'm looking for advice on purchasing a
better weapon, where money is an issue (I have about 45 pp in the
bank).  I just need to know how much I can expect to have to save
before I can upgrade, and what kind of weapons would be in my price
range.  I have maxed out 1H slashing and 1H blunt for my level.
Particularly, I would like to buy a magical weapon.  

It's kind of depressing to play with meleers with my spell caster alts
(my highest is a lvl 25 iksar necro) and see them hitting for 50
points damage ;)

Thank you for your advice,
Jennie
