I don't play EQ2 but since one person who does says that isn't a
problem with them, I will relate my experiences with trader mode
and even regular play in EQ.

I went through a period where I got disconnected every 72 minutes.
(I'm not sure if I'm remembering the exact number of minutes, but
for a long period of time, it was a very regular cycle of disconnects.)
While I can't point at the exact thing that stopped this because
two things happened pretty much simultaneously. We fiddled around
with our wireless router and the cable company did some replacing
of their equipment.

If you don't have a wireless system set up in your house, how old
is the equipment/wires your cable company is using? Or your tele-
phone wires if you're using dial-up?
