DAoC is a hard game to rate.  If you just talk about the PvE part of
the game (the 'leveling to get to the good part' part), its probably
about a 5 or a 6.  When you're talking about the endgame, though
(RvR), I think its probably closer to a 9.  Its true that there are
some classes who have been able to compete solo (rogue and archer
types), but Mythic clearly doesn't intend this to be true and is
constantly making changes to fix this.  So probably - in theory: 9.5.
In reality: 8
