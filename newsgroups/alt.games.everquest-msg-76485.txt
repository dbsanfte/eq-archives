Only racial hide, which like wood elves is only useful if you have
something to con (only way you can tell if you really hid)

Actually I think they are ok if agnostic, non kos in rivervale even.
They possibly have some trouble in the elf cities though and firiona
vie I'd guess. Judging from my dark elf cleric of innoruuk (double
faction problem), they are fine for the most part in qeynos and
freeport though if inny have to do some work.

Yeah agnostic gnome has pretty good factions, probably the best
overall for a mage who also has infravision.
