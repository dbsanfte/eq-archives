It will either force some to quit EQ or force them to upgrade their 
hardware or OS, etc.  Definitely the OS if they are on Win95.  It looks 
like Microsoft isn't supporting Win95 with DX 8.1, and EQ requires DX 8.1, 
effectively forcing all Win95 users to ramp up or quit playing.

VI is an a spot - they wanted to make the "world" that all the EQ players 
live in better, so they did.  They needed to do something to appease the 
wants and needs of the high-level crowd.  Hopefaully, they did this, too.  
I applaud them for this.

But, to do this, they went with recent "technology" and forced DX 8.1 on 
everyone instead of writing the game for both DX and OpenGL.  This 
effectively kills all Win95 users.  Then, they publish specs on what you 
will need for the game, and from what I have seen here so far, they 
followed a practice that I see a -lot- in the gaming industry and published 
incorrect specs.  It looks like they almost added a surcharge into the 
billing if you install SOL.  I'm sure it would have been profitable because 
the extra money they got from it would have easily covered the number of 
people who quit because of this.

They never should have published a release date until they knew they could 
make it.  They should have tested more and gotten everything working as 
smoothly as possible, and then let everyone know when it would be released 
( ala Neverwinter Nights ).  With the rush on getting DX8 working, along 
with some of the features not working, yet, it is obvious this was a rush 
job.  You should never rush software.

It ain't easy being VI.  It ain't easy being their slaves, either.
