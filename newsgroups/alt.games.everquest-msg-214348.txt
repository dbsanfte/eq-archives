From personal experience:
It runs quite well on my 1.7+ Ghz Athlon XP with 1024 MB of ram, running win
2k, with an ATI Radeon 8500 (64MB) with all graphics options on in 1024x768.
It runs quite passably on my Pentium III-733, 512 MB, Voodoo 5-5500 (64MB)
video card, with all graphics options on in 1024x768. Windows 98SE is the OS
It runs acceptably on my Celeron 2.0 Ghz laptop, 256 MB of ram, and cheap
crap intel onboard video, with all new models except male gnomes and horses
off, in 1024x768. Windows XP is the OS.
I have all expansions except LDoN.
Personal thoughts on Ideal:
1.5 ghz processor or better. Pentium or Athlon technology, stay away from
the Celerons and Durons, unless you want to get a few hundred extra mhz.
768 MB of ram or better.(so you can run browsers and such in the background)
Radeon 8500/Geforce 3 non-mx video card or better.
Absolute minimums:
I understand it will run in 128 MB of ram. I ran it, with Luclin, on a
Pentium III 5500 with a Voodoo 3-3500 (about geforce 2 spec), though I had
512 mb at the time. Win 98 or later is required.
