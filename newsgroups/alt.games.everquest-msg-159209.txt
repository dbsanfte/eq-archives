The problem is that, as I said, *national* crime trends are actually
unrelated to gun control.  Thus, the claim that crime is going up or
down is a function of what time frame you want to use rather than what
gun control there is.

For instance, as I remember, you chose 1997 as you time to start
"counting" crime because that was when .22s were banned in the UK.
During that time, by happenstance, crime was decreasing.  One could
just as easily argue that "real" gun control was actually accomplished
a decade earlier when most rifles and shotguns were banned and access
was controlled, or when licensing was instituted in the 1960s.  If one
starts "counting" in the 1980s, then the correlation data between gun
control and crime is not so kind to gun-control advocates-- in 1995
robbery rate in the UK was 1.4 times higher than in the US, and the
assault rate more than twice that of the US.  More recently, crime in
the UK has been increasing dramatically -- there has been a 47%
increase between 1999 and 2000.  Thus, in order to achieve the decrease
in crime you bruit, you have to ignore rates of some years ago *and*
recent trends and conentrate on one small window.

Your claim that crime has been dropping in the UK during the
time frame you quote is both true but is artifact of carefully 
choosing a small and idiosyncratic time frame and set of crimes 
to evaluate.
