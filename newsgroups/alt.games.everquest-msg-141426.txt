go to castersrealm and look up the spells for your level.  I know I got 
all my spells, and used most of them except maybe the ward summoned 
spells.  If money is a problem then you have a problem until you hit 29. 
  Every level of spells has cost me at least 100pp, level 34's spells 
cost 200 total.  Get a little easier to get money once you can port, 
just don't waste your money on KEI's like I do.  Glad I bought my spells 
for 34 already, I was down to 350pp and thought I had plenty for next 
level. Was gonna buy a KEI when I thought I should go pick them up just 
in case.  I was mighty surprised when I finished hunting all over for my 
spells.
