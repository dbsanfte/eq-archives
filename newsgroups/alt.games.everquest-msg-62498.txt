}Now stop using that Wurmslayer and use a real weapon, damnit! ):oP

Umm... Ok, being from the 'I'm normally an enchanter' school of tanking... 
If the wurmy isn't a real 1hs, can ya tell me a few that are, in that 
price range?  Personally, I'd rather not use a wurmy, because I think it 
looks incredibly stupid.

Is the lammy really what I should be looking at, or are there other 
options?

And how about 2HS?  I'm using a mithril2h... any sort of reasonably 
affordable upgrades out there?

Both of my melees have Sta over 100, so that shouldn't be a problem, but 
the DE SK finds strength pretty limiting as far as what weapons to haul 
around.

(Ahh... to get some weight reduction bags... that would be nice...)
