By your definition, anything that can cause death is a needless risk.

These don't see invis and can be trivially outrun with SoW.

Well, HS has that retarded key requirement which makes it a pain...not
to mention I just forgot.  Gives you an idea how many 45 - 55 zones
there are.

At level 60, pre-change you were in aggro range the moment you zoned
in.  There's a tiny corner near the zoneline where you wouldn't aggro
if you dropped invis but that was it.

I was in there the second night Velious was released.  Heard rumors
that WW was past SG, figured I would take a couple of groups to WW and
see what's there.  Ended up just staying in SG since quite frankly,
those unslowable, unmezzable double 220+ smacking walrusmen were FUN!

Run through CS is trivial, nothing in CS sees invis, not even Fish.

SG, you can use the "self-succor" tactic.

Once in WW, you can run along the zone wall (where NOTHING that sees
invis roams) and make it to DN without any problems.  The Safe Rock is
called Safe Rock for a reason you know...

If I can make this run naked with a level 5 warrior, you can make the
same run at level 45+.

Fear and Hate as I said are no longer raid zones unless you plan on
taking out CT/Inny.  Those zones have level 49 to 51 mobs which are
about the same as krups/ilis in Sebilis (I'm not referring to the
second floor of hate as the pathing there alone makes it a real pain
in the ass).  Referring Fear/Hate as a "raid" zone is like referring
to jail spawn in Sebilis as a raid zone.

Sky is just a mindnumbing torture.  It makes you realize that "what
strange things" isn't a trap, but rather a way to break the fucking
tedium.  Raid Sky?  Not in this life time, ever again.

>And many of the epic encounters. And the

Compared to exp camps, there's little raid content.

There's ToV, maybe VP, maybe ST (by the way this zone CAN be a single
group zone you know).  Outside of those, "raids" are usually only for
specific big mob in zones like Fear (CT), Hate (Inny, HA!), Kael
(Tormax, Derakor/Vindicator), Skyshrine (Yelinak), Icewell (Dain), DN
(Zland, Double HA!) and Western Wastes (Sontalak/Klandicar).

Ok, I'll give you Karnor (VS), Seb (Trak) and Chardok
(Overking/Queen).  But those are far more an exp group zone than raid
zone.

Sure there is.
Guild of 50+ people, you gotta hit ToVN quite a few times to outfit
everyone you know...

Lord Bob is.
One group capped him last night.

Velketor does however, require more than one group.  :)

You do realize that you CAN hunt in ST with just one group right?  ST
is far from the toughest zone in the game.  Infact, it's marginally
more difficult than DN in some ways.

Infact, everything, including the named golems and warders 1 to 3 can
be killed with just three groups.  The non-named trash (which can
rarely load priceless weapons) can be killed with one group.

It's only the last warder that require a full raid calibre force...I'm
convinced in a straight up fight, Ventani is tougher than Vyemm.

There are a shitload more XP-group content than raid content.  BY A
HUGE MARGIN.
