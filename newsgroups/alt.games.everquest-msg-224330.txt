Up until LDoN release, this was a no brainer; you can't cast SOW 
indoors, so if you spend any real time inside, run 3 is the ONLY way to 
be faster than mobs, and if you've been a shaman for any length of time 
you've surely noticed that faster than mobs is a lot more survivable 
than slower than mobs.

Now that Spirit of the Shrew exists, and is in fact a mere level 29 
spell, this arguement is a lot less strong.

However, assuming you have Stoicism, is regeneration really all that 
important any more?  I agree that up to level 44 regeneration is the 
single best thing you can put effort into as a shaman, far cheaper per 
point than FT, and more important than anything else you can buy.  Once 
you get Stoicism, though, your regen rate is no more than a footnote 
compared to how fast the HP are coming back in.

Still, you MUST put 6 points into general AA before being able to buy 
any higher level AAs, and its hard to see any AA that are more useful 
than run 3 and regen 3 for most classes (a monk or warrior will probably 
get more from First Aid 3 than from regen 3)

For most classes, Run 3 is so useful that getting it asap is worthwhile, 
but for a shaman, less so, particularly if you  have your SOW boots and 
SOS spell.  Still, my mage is currently on 100% AA for the very same 
reason you are; I've bypassed the people I want to group with the most, 
and by turning on full AA I can let them catch up a bit while still 
doing something useful.

I'd also love a shot at vox and naggy before I level past them, although 
I have no idea how to find out who's holding open raids on them so I can 
come play.

A level of AA takes the same raw exp as going from level 50 to 51.  52 
to 52 takes more exp than that, 52 to 53 more than 51 to 53, so on and 
so forth.  By the time you hit 65, an AA takes less effort than a single 
blue of "real" exp.  100AA still represents a lot of extra exp 
gathering, but not nearly as bad as what we are now facing, where each 
AA at our level costs us almost as much effort as just getting 53 instead.

Once upon a time, though, anyone wanting to stay 52 so as to be 
Vox/Naggy eligible had to either eat unrezed deaths or sell his soul to 
Sacrifice for essence emeralds.  We at least have something useful to do 
with our experience, even if we aren't doing it in the most efficient way.
