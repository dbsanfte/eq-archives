Most caster items suck. Your magic is your
armor and weapons. And that nifty skel pet. =)

The one thing I recommend is the Velium Jade rings which
are player made and 5ac +30 mana and +30 hp. If you can't
get velium, then get Platinum jade rings 4ac +20mana and +20 hp.
Also, get the Gold Jade bracers.
These are great caster and hybrid items for the lower levels.
You need the ac and hp because you need to get in there
and mix it up in melee once in a while to keep your defense skill up.

Use +mana items instead of +Int items until you start to hit level 25-30,
that is when +Int items start to give more mana on most pieces.
For instance the gold jade bracers 2ac +15 mana and +15 hp give more
mana than the Polished Bone Bracers(2ac +3int, +3wis) for levels 1-24,
after level 25 the PBBs are better.

See if you can find a frozen mantle 6ac +10mana all/all item. great ac and
mana for low level casters. Common drop from snow dervishes in EW and
Iceclad.

For utility items get the large tailored bags for carrying loot. They are
only 6 slot, but have 10% weight reduction and only weigh 0.8 themselves,
and hold large items. These bags are underrated, and have a better weight
to slot ration than the backpacks. These are great for the low strength casters.

I don't know what level you are but my mage had a great time in the Warrens,
there are several spots a pet caster can solo in there and the loot in this zone
is absolutely ungodly for the level of critters in there, lots of bronze weapons,
and the molar quest is decent.
