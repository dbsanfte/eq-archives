Actually, the design decisions are very good. You are attempting to
apply real-world thinking to an extremely abstract simulation. It's
akin to complaining about the fact Monopoly does not provide a good
model of real-estate development or that Chess is not a historically
accurate recreation of medeival warfare. ("What do you mean, a Pawn
becoems a Queen simply by crossing the board? In what genuine medieval
battle did any peasant soldier become elevated to the nobility -- and
changed in gender -- merely by reaching some arbitrary point on the
field? This is idiotic game design!")

The controls on leveling, etc, in online games are there because of
*sound* game design -- and a large part of sound game design is
knowing when to tell 'realism' to bugger off. In my experience, those
sounding the clarion call of 'realism' simply wish to make things
easier for themselves -- very rarely do I hear demands for realistic
rules for encumbrance, the effects of wounds and fatigue, the need to
eat and sleep, the problems of boredom when asked to stand in the same
spot for hours waiting for a rare spawn...

Newbie PLAYERS learn from experienced PLAYERS exactly as you describe
-- a new player whose fifth level character is grouped with a very
experiened players 5th level character will learn a very great deal
about grouping, tactics, monster toughness, game etiquette, and so on,
just as you argue. That's the real world learning where a genuine
mentor teaches a genuine apprentice. In term of game stats, however,
his CHARACTER only improves by facing challenges appropriate to his
level, for sound game design reasons, and if he was credited with
'experience' gained when SirHighLevel rips through a thousand
monsters, it would be grossly wrong and the pinnacle (or depth) of
poor game design. The nature of game systems makes awarding experience
'per kill' impossible -- what happens to the healers or other utility
characters who never kill but who make others capable of killing? So
the 'group' gains experience, not any individual character -- this, it
is always going to be the case that if your system were implemented, a
low-level character would not even need to participate in a fight to
'learn' from it -- utter bollocks.

Frankly, this sounds like a test balloon. "How can I justify rampant
power levelling in way that doesn't sound like I just want to PL all
my alts in a week? Hmmm...let's see if anyone buys THIS argument!"
Nope. Not buying it. Try again.
