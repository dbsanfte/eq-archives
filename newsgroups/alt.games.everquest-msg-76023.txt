Anyone else having this problem:

when getting close to a zone line, a piercing sound comes from your
speakers?

The only way I've been able to make it stop is to type /reverb off everytime
it does this...

I was wondering if something is entered wrong somewhere or something...

It's been doing this since last week's patch....


thanks in advance

Vj
