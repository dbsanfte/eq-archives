2 groups sure. for lesser than time, maybe 3 groups.

we've had some whacky pickup raids, where shamans tanked 2 jail mobs each,
just 1 cleric/druid to heal the MA etc :)   Havent been back since GoD (or
even for a long time in PoP) but its fair to say every new expansion halves
or more the required forces (e.g 2 people/3char kills of king tormax now, 1
group in PoP, and 3-4 groups in SoL)
