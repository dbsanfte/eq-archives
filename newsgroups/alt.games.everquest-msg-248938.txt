I would add to this that nobody sems to know how many people have gotten 
in to the 50s and 60s and become disillusioned and left because of the 
lack of appeal in the game at these levels. I see a lot of people on my 
server who are 55+ in raiding guilds, most people who leave the family 
guilds either join a raiding guild or leave EQ.

How many people have gotten to 50+ and left? My character is at level 
54, and frequently the only groups available are for PoJ, PoI and MM 
LDoN. I am fed up with these zones, so I took up trade skills, I can't 
afford to continue smithing without resorting to leaving my computer on 
to trade in the bazaar. Like other posters here I will never reach the 
elemental planes as I am a husband and father and can't afford the time 
commitments of the raiding guilds. Joining a higher end guild is not an 
issue, since my level 54 is a cleric and I receive frequent invites even 
from 60+ guilds who offer to PL me.

I have spent several hundred plat on KEI, Virtue and Shaman buffs to 
raise my defense to 190, offense to 184 and 1HB to 185 (I would like to 
offer an outstanding thankyou to my trainer here, Erandi the NPC at the 
entrance to the warrens. We have spent many hours together fighting, and 
his 6min respawn time gives me the opportunity to grab a coffee 
etc.).But who needs a cleric with those stats, when all you do is sit, 
med, stand, heal, sit, .....

The best fun I have had recently is in MM LDoN with another cleric, 
since for a while  there our undead nukes offered the opportunity to 
provide a group with additional dps and backup heals. Normally with me 
and the other cleric taking it in turns to be main healer. Very often 
all a cleric can do is fizzle if they are not healing.

My stats are obviously inferior to melee types, but I am struggling to 
raise them now, so what is my future, more sitting, medding, standing, 
healing, etc.. I could start another char, but what do I do in the 50s
more PoJ etc. Find a group who want to do something other than the same 
old zones, who aren't all heavily twinked alts, racing to get to 60+, so 
they can join the same guild as their mains.

So when I hear about the uber guilds being the experts on EQ, all I 
think of is yeah, the mechanics of raiding, PL'ing and talking in an 
obscure jargon akin to d00d speak. I do not deny them their higher end 
game, but let us be clear here, a few thousand members of uber guilds 
paying their $13 a month (or whatever it is, ï¿½10.00 sterling), raiding 
in EQ for 40 hours a week does not make EQ profitable for SOE. But the 
10's of 1000's of us sub level 55 players, who play 10 hours or less, 
does have an effect. And if they had managed to return a few percent of 
the those who got disillusioned, suffered burnout, and fed up with the 
constant releases of buggy code, maybe we would not have the GoD/OoW 
fiasco that has caused SoE to look at the modus operandi of their 
business. Can any one say dx9 and new graphics engine!
