Servitor drops the key , and it is no rent(just peachy keeping a key corpse
grr) . Only greig is a multiple group fight and you really dont need many
people,18 who know what they are doing and it is easily doable. He has got
to be about the absolute most pain in the ass mob ever though. He blinds, ae
knockback that snares, and warps to the scarlet desert zoneline if you push
through a wall.

He also has a tendency like IV and Tho to sometimes drop just one item and
part of his loot table is real sucky.
