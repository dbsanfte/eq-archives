The nerf forced druids to look around for different ways to do things.
They discovered Quad kiting.  Originally Druids would DOT a mob
and let it chase them around while nuking it, this made them too
powerful. So they fixed it, forcing druids to discover that they could
(and could have all along) kill 4 mobs for the mana it would have
taken to DOT kite 2 mobs...

So they took the lame restriction back off, making it far easier
for druids to group; as a cleric I can't tell you how much of
an improvement it is for me to be able to nuke my buddy's
DOT'd pulls without worrying that I'll be taking away more damage
than I"m adding in, by breaking root.
