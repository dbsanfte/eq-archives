I wouldn't worry about the port potions just yet.  They trivial at 170, your
max skill level at 52 is 140.  There are some very nice utility potions,
but, it is very hard to actually sell any.  I have sold countless sow
potions, and a few of the others you have mentioned, but it is very rare
that I do sell anything other than sow.  I will gladly make potions to
order, but I refuse to stock any of them anymore, other than sow.
