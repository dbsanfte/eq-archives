Not to be ragging on Verant Customer Service but I have seen a report
somewhere saying Verant has 297,000 users world wide. then figure that at
$10.00 a month I think they should have a longer live customer service then
8:30-5:30 PST Monday-Friday being though I live in the PST and work from
8:00-5:00 I find it diffcult and frustrating when I have a problem and need
to talk to someone and have to wait till the next day and the rep asks are
you at your machine. Then says try this and call me tomorrow if it doesnt
work.
