I think at times, its a player knowing when to say.. "woooo this is
not going to work" that helps.

There have been more then a few raids where it was my job to let the
raid know as a whole that without class XYZ, we would not be doing the
event.

Now if the other players in the LDON were honestly trying.. then go
back to the LDON camp and pickup a new MT that can get the work done.
drop the AFK and get a bard (beat that chanter right out).
