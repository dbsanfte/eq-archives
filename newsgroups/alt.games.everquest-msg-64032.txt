Bitch, bitch, bitch.  

You launch a enterprise of this magnitude, and have it all go as
planned, and then maybe I'll care about your disappointment.

I have no doubt that Verant, and more importantly, the people doing
the grunt work on this upgrade, would have LOVED for it to go off
without a hitch.  Unfortunately, the real world is just chock full of
shit that no amount of planning and preparation can foresee.

Cope.  Go outside.  Read a book.  I'm sure you'll survive.
