So should a crappy player warn the group that they suck before they join?

I bot a cleric/shaman generally, and imo (and people I group with) my
botting a cleric is better than a lot of 60 clerics in the group (there are
a few clerics in my guild I would take over me botting, but Id say 90% of
groups id rather bot myself, and my friends would rather I bot too)
