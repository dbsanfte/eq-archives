Personally never tried the Ro one - but have got the OOT one on three
occassions. No magic tricks here - its either luck or a long camp. First
time I got him was after 20 mins. Second time in 10 mins. Third occassion 4
hour camp and nothing. Fourth time 3 hour camp and Ancient pops. I have also
seen him in my early days - popped and nothing camping him (did not even
know what he was in those days).

I would suggest regular visits to OOT and set aside say an hour for camp and
do this whenever you can - you will get lucky at some point.

From all the suggestions in Ro about what to do I would say he is just a
random spawn just like the OOT one. Suddenly he spawns and people attribute
it to what they kill - probably just random. But hey never done that camp so
cant really say.
