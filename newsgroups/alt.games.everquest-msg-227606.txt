The average small systems builder will deliver an assembled PC for 
virtually the same price as they will sell you the component parts in boxes.

There are also still many pitfalls to actually assembling them. CPU 
heatsinks can be intimidating... connecting the motherboard to the case 
can often be trying, connecting firewire and usb headers if the wires 
are all seperate can be a pain, BIOS configuration is also 
intimidating... its not making tomato soup yet.

And while you are correct, that actually building pc's these day's is 
comparative cake, selecting good components in the first place requires 
for more knowledge than you give credit for.

Again a reputable small systems builder won't deliver a PC with the 
wrong RAM type, mismatch the CPU and motherboard socket, forget the SATA 
power adapters, or select a TNT2 because it says Xtreme 3D Gamer on it etc.
