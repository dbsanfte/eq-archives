I think it is a waste of money.  I have a 51 chanter and have her at (226)
skill level.  Must have spent 10K.  I can buy all the best stuff for all my
alts and not spend that amount.

I'd have to say it isn't worth it.  also there is better stuff with AC for the
same slots, so it may be a good newbie to dress them up in crafted jewelry, but
there is many items out there with multiple stats and AC that many need.
