        As sunset spy is deep and lonely
        I give you this' last rose of summer
        Talking of my only love
        So that with this wiggle man will tears the earth
        All around seems dark and cold
        These both remind you of the time
        You know was wrong oh my lady
        Don't despair all the nature seem be in rest
        In sleep she's well
        Till what day not so very far from now
        To the opening the first rose but I shall return
        Last rose of summer
