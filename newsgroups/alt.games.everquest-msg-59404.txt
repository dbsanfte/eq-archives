Lets say you see two mobs that you would like to kill, for loot and
experience.

You and good old Gabn face off with the two of them, you may find yourself
petless and with two still angry mobs on you... Gabn can't really take two
mobs down all that reliably, although with some luck with fear and snare
and dots you may pull it off after all.

An alternative approach, though is to charm one of the pair, and help it
kill
the other.  By the time the target is dead, your "pet" is also likely fairly

hurt... by design, you spend only enough mana to tip the odds in favor
of your pet.  Break that charm (or wait for it to break on its own) and you
face an angry, but easily killed, former pet.

For the cost of a charm and enough mana to do a "finishing shot" to two
mobs, you get two kills.

As you note, things don't always work as hoped with this plan, charm
may break and leave you facing both mobs with -no- pet, or the target
may kill your pet while it is still charmed, shorting you of exp and loot
(the charmed mob will poof just like Gabn will if he's killed)

It is advisable to root or snare your charm target before charming it,
so you don't have such worries when things break.  Being on SOW
also helps a lot here.  I'm not sure necros can charm a necro snared
mob, isn't that a DOT?

A particularly amusing strategy is to put a damage shield on your charmed
pet; this means that toe to toe with an identicle match, he will dish out
a good deal more damage, and yet since you have no intention of ever
melee-ing him even after charm breaks, the buff will not increase his
ability to kill you.  Another possibility is to hit him with a little
healing in
order to keep him from losing the match, but not so much as to leave
him healthy...

Something I have yet to try, that occurs to me for a necro, would be to
hand that charmed pet a weapon.  Normal pets, when killed, you lose
the weapon.  But normal mobs, when killed, usually have things you
gave them on their person.  If you make sure the charm target is not
a pet when it dies, will it still have your weapon on it for you to recover?

There are some weapons normally considered POS that make very
nice pet tools, ones with a high damage but very high delay.  Throwing
away 15pp on a pet weapon isn't necessarily a good idea even if it
does turn that 20 damage into a 40 damage... but if you could rely
on getting the weapon back much of the time, it might make more sense.
Again, we assume that no mob, whether former charmed pet or not,
is ever allowed in melee range of the necro...
