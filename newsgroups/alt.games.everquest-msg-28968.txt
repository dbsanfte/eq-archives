Likely? Not really relevant. The important fact is that it's possible.

*You* were the one making an absolute statement that, unless you're a
member of the EQ live team, you couldn't possibly know or prove.

In case you don't recall what it was:

>Kith changes its entire spawn table at 8 PM game time, 
>and again at 8 AM game time.  ***QHills doesn't.***
[emphasis added]

You see, by noting that Kith does this, you demonstrate quite clearly
that it *is* possible to do this, and therefore it may be occurring in
Qeynos Hills. You claimed that it doesn't happen, but you offered no
proof to support that claim.

>That I've seen spawn during the day, I may add.

Dennis, the day I take *your* word alone for something, well, let's
just say that day is far far away.
