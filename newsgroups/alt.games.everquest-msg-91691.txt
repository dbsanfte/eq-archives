That is my attitude, I Breeze without asking, esp if I ask for a SoW
or need help. If I am out working, in a group, and I get a
/t Hey I need a Breeze! 
from some guy who just zoned in, or a guy who asks WHEN I AM fighting,
I usually ignore them until I am dang good and ready. If they get
testy, its a warning /ooc about leave me be please.

If I get a 
/t Can I please get a Breeze when you can?
I respond right away and don't have a problem doing it, if I am not
LOM.

I act in kind with others, and try and breeze BEFORE I ask and not in
a combat zone and regardless of if they buff in return.
