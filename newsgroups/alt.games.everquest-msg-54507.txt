It had already degenerated when you started contradicting yourself while 
attempting to validate / justify your breaking the EULA.  See below:

Once again, spare us - in the newsgroup and in EQ where the the people on 
Rathe will have to deal with a clueless newbie with a powerful character.  
Please post the characters' names so I can warn my friends there.

As for insults, insulting our intelligence by trying to justify yourself in 
the same way other idiots do was the beginning.  You got your advice - go 
to playerauctions.com, but don't try to make yourself sound innocent.
