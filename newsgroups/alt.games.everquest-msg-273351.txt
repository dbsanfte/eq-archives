    Potential_noob_1 wanders into computergame store.

    Sees Everquest 1 Expansion: Dragons of Norrath (working name: So Very
Tired)

    Sees Everquest II next to it.

    ...

    I think the inescapable fact is this: In most people's minds, that is
the equivalent of putting an expansion pack for Medieval Total War next to
Rome Total War on the same shelf. EQ1 is going to have a _very_ hard time
attracting new players now, based purely on what EQII is doing, let alone
WoW.

    So I'm sorry Mike I can't agree. Everquest has been slowly dying for an
awfully long time. Subscriptions peaked aroundabout PoP (was it just prior
to PoP?) and have been declining since, with two very steep dives right
after GoD was released and right after the EQII/WoW releases.

    And now there will be very few noobs for the grind.

    Oh and no doubt purely to annoy me, Sony has announced that classes will
be finally 'rebalanced'. If anything could save EQ for me, it would be that.
Unfortunately, it's a couple of months too late.

Cheers,
James
