Of course it matters. When one company uses unethical methods to pressure
other comapnies and reduce competition the consumer suffers.

But isn't that exactly it? Microsoft dosen't allow a free and open business
environment. Microsoft does whatever it can to stifle and undermine
competition.

But this is getting away from the original point of why I posted. The
assertation was made that all bashing of Bill Gates is driven by jealousy.
That's simply not the case. Lots of people dislike Microsoft and Gates
because of their business practices. I use and rather like Microsoft's
products. However, I find the way they do business distasteful. If Linux
were viable alternative I'd jump ship in a heart-beat, but it isn't there,
not yet.
