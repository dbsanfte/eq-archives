It wouldn't even effect me even if the content were incomplete. I
haven't even used the content from OoW, GoD, and only briefly used some
content from LDoN. Heck, I'm only just now getting around to completing
the small-group content of Kunark, and only about maybe a third to half
through what Velious has to offer. Haven't even started the Planes
beyond stepping foot in PoJ and PoD, then zoning right back out.

The unfinished content gripe does not apply to me. I simply thought the
article was interesting, and might have been of interest to those whom
it might apply. Even if the content for PoR comes through in full,
totally completed and miraculously bug free I will not purchase it. It
has nothing for me.

No, it's the shoplifter who ripped the registration tag who ripped me,
OR it's SoE for neglecting to put a registration tag in the game. I
know no stores that take software returns and for good reason; it's far
too cheap and easy to burn a copy, then return the original. The
store's left holding the bag.

My point, though, was even after I explicitely stated that 1) there
were no more copies left and 2) the store does not take software
returns their suggestion was to return the software for an exchange or
refund. This tells me they did not even bother to read the message, but
simply sent a stock response based on how it was categorized.

Similar have actually happened to me before. Blizzard was gracious
enough to provide me with a replacement registration number after
sufficiently proving my copy of WarCraft III was legitemate.

The proper response would have been to at least acknowlege my plight.
As it is, I have the sense there is no actual CS at SOE, just an
automated system with maybe a skeletal crew to maintain them and
possibly, on the rare occourrance, handle big CS requests.

It's too bad, really. I very much enjoy the EQ setting and lore, even
with the recent tangents. The game, at it's core, and the concept are
fantastic. The quality of execution is not.
