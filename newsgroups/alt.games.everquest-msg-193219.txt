Cleric can heal pets. Mage is a very good choice for a cleric partner.
Both parties keep gate ready. Necro will work and offers FD splitting.
You didn't mention the race/religion of your toons but I'd try to use
whichever has closer faction to the cleric so you can both travel to
similar areas. Others might suggest totally opposite factions so
there's always a merchant you can use.

It would take time to get the cleric up to the paladin's level but you
could power level him near a zone line -- just taunt and beat on it
with him but zone before the mob dies. Once the cleric is 24, he could
just group with the pally.

Druid would work.  Druid SoW's group then snares a mob. Cleric fears
mob that the druid has snared. Beat on the mob as it runs away slowly.
If the mobs are undead, both characters could DoT.
