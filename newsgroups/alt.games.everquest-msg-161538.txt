Sure can remove surname, just /petition  Would like to remove my surname.
If you have a new one that your thinking of then add that to the petition,
or just say you don't want a new one right now.  Just remember only a Senior
guide or GM can remove it.  Depending on what server your on that could take
awhile.

Good luck
