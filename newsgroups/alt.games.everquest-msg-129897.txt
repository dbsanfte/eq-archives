My theory on the constant "rebalancing" of Hybrid classes is this;
Everyone pretty much accepts that Warriors are the Tank of choice in the end
game, more HP and Defensive. This info then filters down to the lower level,
exp grind groups who then get the idea that only a Warrior will do as a Tank
when other melee classes can fill the role as well (not least SK's and
Paladins) so Verant "rebalance" the Hybrids to make them of more use to the
end game and so to filter down and become more desirable for the mid and low
range groups.
Verant's whole plan is to finally eradicate the situation of;
Player_01 Shouts"Paladin LFG"
Player_02 Shouts "School Caretaker LFG"
Group Member_01 tells party "Get the Caretaker, he can clear up the corpses"

The Warrior class may be underpowered due to all the constant rebalancing
(elderly people no longer collect pensions on Norrath, they just Mug
Warriors for money) but they are still considered the best at their job, the
fact that they only really become the out and out best when they hit 55
isn't a concern as such, what they do better than any hybrid is get invites
to groups.
