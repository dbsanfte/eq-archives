EverQuest - Live Update - 07/13/05
----------------------------------

*** Headlines ***
----------------------------------
Trouble grows in Norrath! Dark Elves have been seen traveling the lands 
reeking havoc as they pass. Cities are calling out to their citizens for 
help gathering supplies in preparation for possible war.  Something big is 
happening in Norrath now as the Age of War continues.

*** Events ***
----------------------------------
- Players should no longer be KOS to Killvak or the troll raiders in 
Barrenzin's mission "Trollish Bloodlust"


*** Spells ***
----------------------------------
- Increased the damage, mana, and cast time of the Necromancer and 
Shadowknight spell Siphon Life to better fit the progression of the other 
spells of the same type.
- Fixed a problem that caused Shadowknights to proc the wrong effects from 
Spirit of the Puma and Spirit of the Jaquar.
- When a rogue /consider's an NPC that can see through normal forms of 
invisibility, and the rogue is hidden from the NPC due to their Shroud of 
Stealth, the player will continue to receive the "indifferent" consider 
message but will also receive the following message: "Your Shroud of Stealth 
keeps you hidden from watchful eyes."
- We have fixed the gating issue when on a mount and you are in the same 
zone you are bound and your vertical location of your bind point is much 
lower than you are currently.  You will no longer fall to your death.  Yeah 
for falling!
- When casting bind, your current heading will now be saved.
- Dark Sieve and Dark Sieve Recourse now have 200 range.


*** Pet Focus ***
----------------------------------
- Increased the innate AC bonuses granted to level 66+ pets by focus 
effects.
- Increased the melee damage bonuses provided by pet focus effects on level 
66-70 pets.


*** Items ***
----------------------------------
- The new potions will now be level restricted as they were previously 
intended to be.
- Some type 9 augmentations are now usable in the charm slot.
- Plaguebreeze will now drop more frequently.
- Removed Patorav's Amulet from the "bonus" table on Overlord Mata Muram.
- Mask of the Heretic now has 12 AC.
- Blightbringer's Cap of the Grave now modifies the Specialization: 
Conjuration by 12%.
- Any type 9 augment that fit in a visible slot now is also a type 12 
augment.
- Jelvan has learned the technology of the printing press and will now 
distribute his writings more often.


*** Auto Consent ***
----------------------------------
- Auto-consent raid, group, or guild will now auto-consent all future and 
existing corpses.  If you turn off auto-consent then consent for your group, 
raid, or guild will be removed from all existing corpses.  Please note that 
in order for a group member or raid member to be able to drag one of your 
existing corpses, they had to be in your group or raid at the time your 
corpse was created.  This is the functionality that has always been in 
place.


*** Tasks and Missions ***
----------------------------------
- The entrance to Everfrost is now a little easier to explore.
- The issue preventing some groups from entering the Unrest mission has been 
fixed.


*** Graphics ***
----------------------------------
- /viewport should work with Advanced Lighting on now.
- We have fixed a common Reset Device error.
- Fixed an issue with rendering trees and other alpha'ed textures when 
running on older hardware.
- We have fixed a common crash with our DLL.


*** Particles ***
----------------------------------
- We have made some fixes to the particle rendering.  Some people were 
seeing square textures.


*** UI ***
----------------------------------
- You can now use the "Enter World" button at character select if you are 
camped in tutorialb.
- Merchants' items should now be sort correctly using the Quantity column.


*** Tradeskills ***
----------------------------------
- Changed one of Chef Chowderly's recipes.  Pan Seared Orange Tuna will now 
use a Non-Stick Frying Pan in the recipe instead of a Large Stewing Pot.
