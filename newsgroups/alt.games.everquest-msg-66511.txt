Can I suggest all those that are having problems go to the Everquest
Technical Help Forum
(http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?actio
n=topics&forum=Technical+Help&number=3) and see if the have an answer.
Granted they may not, and there is also a lot to work through to find
specific problems sometimes.  But it may just be worth it.  In particular
someone has started a thread on fixes people have found - while this may not
fix your problem even if you have the same symptons once again it may be
worth it.  I can be found here:

Good luck to you all.
