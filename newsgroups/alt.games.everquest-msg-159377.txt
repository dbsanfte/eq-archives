*shrug*  You're in a guild, why solo when all you need to do is
get a partner who can stun?  At L30 a Paladin has three fast
casting stun spells plus Bash.  I can't speak for your guildmates,
but I'm always happy to help out with quests, especially if its
a seemingly straightforward deal like you describe here, and I'd
expect most Paladins would be absolutely tickled to be asked to
do something because they're the best class for the job, as opposed
to the usual "well, maybe, if I can't get a Warrior" attitude.
