It's true through the 44th level spells, at least, for enchanters, mages,
and wizards.   The spells are found in an upper room of the casters
tower in Katta Castellum, approximately at n700, n100.  The upper
rooms are reached by clicking on a wall hanging at the back of the
room.

So, how many of those words did your necro actually hunt himself, not
including buying them from vendors?   If they actually wanted research
to be done, it's a simple matter to made the words no-drop and the
spell itself no-drop.   Want the spell, research it.   Instead, people were
buying words in bulk from vendors or buying the spell itself from people
who were doing so.   If they'd wanted people to do the practice runes,
all they had to do was use the same code that's there for tradeskills:
you can't train past a certain level.  That wouldn't guarantee that the
practice runes would be done, but it would make it a lot more likely.

Players avoided research *as it was designed to happen* like the plague
so they got rid of the requirement to do it.   If you want to for
role-playing
purposes (or just to be able to do it), you still can.   I think it's a
great
change:  they looked at what they had, saw it wasn't working, and decided
to make it easier rather than more difficult.
