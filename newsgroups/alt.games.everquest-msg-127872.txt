    Or the quest is "broken as intended". I think to the entire Lanys quests
a while back, where one NPC in the chain of turn-ins one needed to do wasn't
handing out the piece needed, no matter what faction you had. People
actually figured out every part of the quest - what you did that would lead
to that turn-in, and even what you would do after that turn-in and what the
final turn-in was. But she was never fixed, and eventually the mobs for the
quest were removed from game. Now you tell me - did VI count that as an
"unsolved quest", or as a "miserable internal screwup"?
