That was our problem the first (and only) time I've been in Takish.  Things
ran and they ran fast.  We weren't prepared on the first mob, but then the
ranger started snared everything.  Things went pretty well until, for some
reason, he didn't snare one.  It ran and brought back five buddies.  That
basically ended the adventure.  We got back and pushed onward, but ran out
of time well short of finding the boss to assassinate.
