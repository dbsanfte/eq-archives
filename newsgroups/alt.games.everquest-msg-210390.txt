1.(haste%) doesn't really work, as you can have haste over 100% total.

It would be New Delay=Old Delay/(1+Haste%/100)

Now, to look at what you were saying was incorrect.

100/(100+haste) * delay

is equivalent to

1/(1+haste/100)*delay

which is equivalent to

delay/(1+haste/100)

Looks awfully familiar there.
