This sort of addition might actually make it so those level 20 bards
in Paludal who don't understand that you can play more than one song,
might actually "look" like they know how to play.

I have a level 67 bard, and I can't tell you how many times I've
grouped, as a lowbie, in a place like Paludal with a bard that could
barely get one song going, and didn't have half of the songs available
for their level.

When I was 20, I was 3-twisting (had a crappy video card).

That said, from what I've seen on Sony's board, this change will be
pretty nice for me.  The twisting feature allows me to interrupt it
with a different song (or songs) to play, and it will resume twisting
as soon as I am done.  This should prove useful for grouping, raiding,
etc.  I'm looking forward to see how well it does in the face of
missed notes, too.
