All of the Servers/PCs (about 150 total) where I work are Dells. 

Service has been great. We buy all of our machines with the 3 year
warranty. Parts are always shipped overnight with the return shipping
tag in the box. So far we have only lost a couple of mice and 3
harddrives. All were replaced for free under warranty.

We buy the Optiplex desktops. The motherboards run Intel chipsets
(810E/815E, etc) with built in 3com 10/100 nics (some have built in
sound). The cases/motherboards/floppies are proprietary. They use a
peripheral riser card for the PCI expansion slots. All of the other
components are standard and can be easily transferred to another
system durring a future upgrade. I am not familiar with thier home use
machines, but I am sure they are similar.

There really is no "catch" when buying a Dell. You get what you pay
for. The system will be solid, stable, and come with a decent
warranty. It won't be the fastest or best "tuned" machine compared to
a home brewed PC with hand selected components, but it will require a
lot less TLC.

The weakest part of the system (from the perspective of a components
enthusiast)  will be the motherboard  It won't have any of the
features that allow you to tweak or overclock. 

Most local "custom" shops use cheap motherboards and cases to squeak
out as much profit as possible. Compared to a Dell these systems will
be MUCH louder (Dell cases have better sound insulation and fewer fans
are required for cooling), and offer similar performance.

Nice processor. 

>Memory 512MB PC1066 RDRAM (2X256 modules)

I would personally go with DDR memory PC2700/3200. Spec out the next
level down Dimension. RDRAM is more expensive and really doesn't offer
that much more performance (2-5%?). The future is DDR.

>Vdeo Card 128MB DDR ATI RadeonT 9700 TX Video Card w/DVI and TV-Out

Best Video card currently out. 

>peration System Microsoft� Windows� XP Home Edition (English)

Great OS

Go with the Turtle Beach:Santa Cruz if you have the option.
