There was raiding before PoP gave us the Raid Window. So aside from
strange raid exp distribution (that frankly I don't know how it works)
there isn't much difference.

There is a marked difference between 6 full 10th level unrelated
groups fighting in Crushbone or Blackburrow and a coordinated raid of
6 full 10th level groups. Differnce being able to take down the harder
stuff in the zone out of it's normal expected level range.

Clearing out a zone where most of the mobs are even con or higher is
quite the rush.
