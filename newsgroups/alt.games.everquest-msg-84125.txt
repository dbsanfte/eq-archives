Actually Kelly flock never said what he was quoted in Edge magazine of
saying as far as I know, in fact a totally different set of quotes
which looked far more real appeared in other magazines like PC gamer.
None of the quotes in such magazines were insulting.

Brad McQuaid and Jeff Butler are not programmers.

Penny Arcade is a web comic rather than a very legit source of gaming
industry news.
