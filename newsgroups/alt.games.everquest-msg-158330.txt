Once every few play sessions, in both EQ and DAoC, I was getting a blue
screen on WinXP.  According to the event log, it was error 0x1000008E, and
clicking the link to check it at Microsoft found nothing, as did a search of
the Knowledgebase.  Furthermore, looking at the dump with dumpchk doesn't
give the location of the error, so I can't narrow it down to what driver is
involved.

If anyone else is seeing this, there *is* hope. :-)

I recently changed the system settings to not reboot on blue screens, so I
could read the message, and I noticed something: the error number on the
blue screen is 0x00000008E, *NOT* the 0x1000008E that shows up in event log.
The significance of this is that error 0x00000008E *DOES* show up in the
Knowledgebase.  There are two suggestions: update to the latest video
drivers (I had already done that), and update to the latest VIA drivers.

That's normally not a problem for me, because when I build computers, I pick
motherboards that use good chipsets, instead of VIA chipsets, but my gaming
system was a store-bought pre-built, and when I checked, I found that it
does have a VIA chipset.  I don't know yet if updating the VIA drivers fixed
the problem--I've only played EQ once and DAoC once since then.
