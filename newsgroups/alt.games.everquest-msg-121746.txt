This should be an excellent combo; a necromancer is more than capable
of soloing thru his carreer without ever having to melee, and there's no
real reason the shaman should have to do anything but hide and buff
the pet.  On the other hand, Shaman is the most melee capable of the
priest classes (a sad admission from an avowed battlecleric) due to his
ability to haste himself and buff himself thru the  roof and then slow
the mob hitting him down to a standstill.  If the necro is fear kiting there's
no real reason the shaman shouldn't be in there swinging as well, sure
he'll be outdamaged by the pet but it won't cost any mana.

The most effective buffs you can put on the pet will be haste, then
HP (if you aren't fear kiting) and then Dex (assuming the pet is
using proccing weapons or has his own procs, at low levels this
actually wont' do much) and perhaps Regeneration (pet regen rate is
already quite high, but at higher levels it still takes a while, and anything
you can do to cut downtime is worthwhile)

I question whether this combination will be capable of killing more
than twice as fast as the necro solo, and the new rules for exp will
make anything less than this less desirable from a pure efficiency
standpoint, but I've always found partnering far more interesting than
soloing regardless of the cold hard facts.  Plus partner pairs
tend to die less often than any other form of norrath grouping,
Solo artists can be overwhelmed by a run of bad luck, and larger
groups have communication issues that duos tend to lack... if
one guy is in trouble you don't have to worry about which of
the others is handling it... you are the poor fellow's only hope!
