Actually I played an Online RPG that was all in German for quite a while.
I've never taken a class on German, and still can't speak any of it, but you
can get a general feel (after a while) for what everything means. Sure,
after 3 months, I was still mystified at what some things were and couldn't
follow an in-depth conversation but I got by, and could type some of the
stock phrases pretty well. Generally (as you see on EQ) people who couldn't
speak the language sought each other out, but that didn't keep me from
joining all-German groups.
