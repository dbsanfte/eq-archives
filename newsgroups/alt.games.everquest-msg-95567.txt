Quick note, if the critter is DOTed and running after you for any part of 3
ticks (root breaks, you root 3 seconds later...that's a tick, even though
it's not 6 seconds...do that 3 times for a total of 9 seconds and it's still
3 ticks...someone will correct me if I'm wrong) then DOTs only do 2/3
damage.

Druids and necros are kings of solo kiting though clever wizards and shaman
can do a good job.  Bards and any class with a bow CAN kite though it's
about as effective as saying that a level 50 warrior can do solo melee
(yeah, it's possible...but damned slow, comparatively speaking).
