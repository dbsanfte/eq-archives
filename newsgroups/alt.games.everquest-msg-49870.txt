Keep practicing them, they will go up.  at early levels try to hide
first, then without moving keep trying to sneak until successful.  Nice
for moving through areas that stuff wants to kill you.

Pickpocketting is required for the Rogue epic.  You will need to be able
to pickpocket notes from guild leaders in Neriak and Kaladim, not sure
of the actual skill level needed, but i believe it's over 200 if I had
to guess without looking it up.  Gnoll pups and scouts make good choices
as do the ice goblins.  There is a camp of goblins between the one
guard, and three guard spawns on the edge of the tundra.  I found that
to be a good place to practice at.  Pickpocket will go up off of green
mobs.  If you plan on using pickpocket while grouped, be sure to let
others know, and abide by their decission, if they don't want you to pp,
then don't.  All pickpocketed coin comes from the same loot pool as what
you get on killing it, so it can make groups upset if the mobs are
always picked clean.
