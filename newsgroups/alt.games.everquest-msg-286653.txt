I've heard horror stories like this, but i've always been fine. Cable
connection, fast computer, all set - but the last few days i've been
tooling around in norrath again and i go linkdead when i zone. What
gives? Known issue? Hopefully with a known fix (that someone could
point me toward?).

Presently I can't even log in without going LD between character
select and the actual game. Gonna start messing around with my
firewall (running winXP pro, like a fewl). The 5 minutes of waiting
between the LD and when i can resume playing = enough to make me quit
another year or two.

We, the players, should organize and become vocal so that no new
players will take up a sony game until stupid, careless bugs/issues
are fixed/resolved. I played for 5 years without this problem, so they
clearly changed something (i haven't touched my settings from the last
time i played, without issue, last summer). They really do focus their
efforts on new content to try to pull in new players (or is it to
appease the powergamer crowd?), believing that having happy casual
players is (fixing bugs, improving things that are broken) the least
lucrative business model. Am i wrong in that perception? Because if
not, we should do that, we should make it clear to potential new
players that sony doesn't know how to administrate an mmo, and let
sony see we're doing that. Maybe that would work. Guess we'd have to
convince them that we happy, older players would pull in people via
word of mouth once we were satisfied with the quality of the game.

Or is it too late for that? No one really plays eq, huh?
