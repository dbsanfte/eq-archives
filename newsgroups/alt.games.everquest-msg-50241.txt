 It's no big deal man.. fail it if you want, the runes are SOOO easy to get
not to mention the spell itself. I've made many many copies of the IC spell
for younger Wizzies. If you're on Mith Marr, look up Ziljiin I'll whip up
a copy for you if you can't find one someplace. I'd say this is probably 
one of the easier spells to acquire. Just wait til you get in the mid to 
high 50s boy, it's really a pain to get spells then.
