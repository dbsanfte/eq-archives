That's not part of any definition of "hate crime" I've ever
seen.  "Hate crime" would seen to be a crime committed with
a motive of hate, rather than greed, etc.  And that is the
common legal definition, correct?

And, off-hand, I can't think of a well-known hate crime
(Sheppard(?), etc.) that was intended to have the crime
replicated.  It was "just" kill/beat/injure this person
because they're different.

And, at least IMO, "they're different" applies to both class
as well as other distinctions, so your "properly implemented"
hate crime includes the "they had more money than me" crime
as well as the "they're a different color than me" crimes and
ends up meaning nothing.
