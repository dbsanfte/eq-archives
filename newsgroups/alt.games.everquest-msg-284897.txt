Bloody disgrace, that.  I have no intentions of playing any other Sony
game, so no way am I paying for Station Access merely for two extra
character slots.  I own all the expansions, and having coughed up
approx �20 per expansion (over �100+) AND subscribed for that last 4+
years, I think they should give the extra slots for free!  I bet they
think people are so stupid that, after a few weeks/months of 10
characters, everyone will be so attached to their two new alts that
they'll be willing to pay them more cash.  I think not, Sony.

It's really fuzzy and, as you two mention, it sure is fugly.
