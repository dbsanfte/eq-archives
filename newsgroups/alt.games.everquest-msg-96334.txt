Uh huh, and what level are you?  Also, you have to be freakin braindead
never to have heard of warping.

To the dot guy who started this (you really need to change your display
name), DO NOT follow the stream the whole way or you'll occasionally run
into some iksar that'll kill you really fast.  I think her name is something
like Vekis.  She hangs out at the mouth of the stream so go wide around
that, then you can follow the stream if you want.

Sow, camo & run.  Avoid spiders that you can (that haven't warped <suddenly
appeared> ) and just run.  Not all spiders can see through invis, PLUS their
aggro range isn't that big.
