Damn.  I did forget Lokari.   Actually, it seems you don't even need to add
"and in thier day" to that one.   Despite her limited time, Lokari still has
8260 posts, putting her about second on the list.  (Actually you might need
to knock that down to about 8240.  I seem to remember someone trying to run
her through the mud by impersonating her for a while.)

I remembered Jazz, but I also knw he switched names, so it was going to be
too much work to look him up.    Since I was called on it though, I did the
legwork.  4620 posts under JaZZmanian Devil, 270'ish under Jazz.  (And 1090
for his better half.)

Yep.  Didn't bother searching him, since he did the no archive thing.
Perhaps his flamewar targets are there though.

Madbomma - 1320
Taras Bulba - 983

Altogether somewhat disappointing.

... wow.  Theres one I didn't expect either.   Was searching for "Morgan" -
Now famous as Xymarra for her UI interface :)

Dan Harmon, 12400 posts.    Sorry Dan, either I missed a few or or that
search is pulling in someone else.   Although it doesn't look like it from a
quick scan.  :P
