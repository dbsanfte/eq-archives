Caster balancing doesn't mean "all casters solo with the same
effectiveness."  That's what you're asking for...quit yer whining, no one
but other whiners wants to hear it.

Wizards are primarily a grouping class.  Deal with it.  For crappy-assed
wizards it's also single-dimensional.  For GOOD wizards it's exciting to be
able to do crowd control in MANY situations (use one staff to really piss
off an add onto you, where you pull him away from the others and root him).

Even BAD wizards with ZERO imagination add a hell of a lot to more raids and
hunts than mages ever will (lure spells).

My main is a 58 enchanter.  I have a 50 wizard that I admittedly dual-play
single-dimensionally for the most part.  For those rare times when my
enchanter isn't needed I have a blast playing my wizzy.

But yeah, I'll agree with you about CT.  Even at 24 before the change it was
suicidal to use.  Rathe Mountains would be a more appropriate location.
