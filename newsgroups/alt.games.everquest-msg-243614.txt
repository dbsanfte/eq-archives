Yeah, some of the old world zones had some good ones. I can still 
vividly recall my first times in Najena. (In fact, I think I posted 
about this in this form a few years back.) The various elementals in 
there at that time were the old model, not the cool new ones we have 
now. They basically all looked like headless, legless torsos that 
floated in one spot. They were idenical except the earth one looked like 
rock, the fire one like flames, etc.

I was playing my old warrior, Jakugg, teaming with Tarre's cleric. 
Whenever you successfully taunted one, it would respond with "I'll teach 
you to interfere with my plans, Jakugg!"

This was rather startling to me, because that early in my career I'd 
mostly been fighting rats and bats and bugs and skellies and such, none 
of whom talked. Najena was a ghost town back then, and almost nobody 
went in there. Those mobs would be up all week unless I was killing them.

I remember thinking to myself, "Plans? What plans am I interfering with? 
I've been watching you while my partner medded up, and as far as I can 
tell you've been sitting on your fat ass there for days now without 
moving a muscle. In fact, the only reason I was able to determine that 
you weren't a freaking statue was that you finally took a swing at me 
when I bashed you over the head with this sword.  So exactly what is 
this oh so important master plan of yours that I'm suddenly interfering 
with?"

It was only after posting here that I learned they say that to anyone 
who taunts them. But at the time it was rather fun.
