    Any normal gem. For my warrior, the last zone she was playing in was
Dreadlands, so all the Opals, Peridots, etc. that dropped went to the person
symboling me. My rogue hasn't been to Sebilis, but in Velk's Lab she gathers
non-quest gems (crushed gems usually sell for close to 20 pp each) and makes
sure they get to the cleric.
