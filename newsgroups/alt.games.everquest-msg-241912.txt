A number of tailoring recipes have "statistics" built into the tailored
piece.  The harder the recipe, the more likely it will be that there will be
statistics.

The backpack  referenced does have a 10% weight reduction and 10 slots
accommodating items up to "large" in size.  The recipe is one High Quality
BEAR skin or one High Quality Hopper hide and one Backpack Pattern.
