	Sure it is.

	If you went out to dinner, and had 7 courses including dessert and 
spent 60 bucks, and after you paid your check the waitress came up and said 
gee I'm sorry but I forgot to put your dessert on your check so I made a 
little seperate check, here, it's only  3.95, would you say sorry toots I
already paid my bill pay it yourself?

	Well. I guess you would.  That would be dishonest, too.
