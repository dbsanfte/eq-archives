Almost defintely the power supply, the bit about it needing unplugging is
probably due to some trip switch in the ps.   Even when your computer is not
powered there is always a very small almount of power trickling through to
the motherboard (for WOL etc).   If you decide it is your powersupply then i
would replace it as soon as possible, it is not unknown for powersupplies to
die and take other components with
them.........(motherboard/drives/cpu/graphics etc)
