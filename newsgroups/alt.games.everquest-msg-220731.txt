Ah.

For the record, Tier 1 and 2 PoP zones all have DC-able targets that I've
found - and the Lesser mobs in BoT can indeed hit for 300s, at least.  (They
look like elementals).  The Young Blood Ravens of PoN and the fly-guys of
PoD are hard-hitters, and the smaller frogs in PoS and PoV can really do a
number on the other locals.  Valiant Companions and the kittens of HoH are
some of my favorites!
