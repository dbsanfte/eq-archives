My baking skill is at 142, I believe ( trivialed rat ear pie ).  Fish rolls 
trivialed at 135, I think and are a Banquet sized meal.  The rat ear pies 
are Hearty meals.  This says to me that I should be carrying around Fish 
rolls to make my food last longer, assuming that Banquet lasts longer than 
Hearty.

Is this true?
