I highly disagree.  What it HAS done is pretty much eliminate a method
many of us used to make money.  Being a Resale Merchant.  I play on MT
as well and have for 2 years.  Most of my money was made by buying low
and selling for normal prices in EC.  Most people hated selling,
especially those with the LEVEL LEVEL LEVEL mentality.  So I might see
someone selling things and being impatient.  53 Pally wanting to get
back to fighting.  What he has would have a value of roughly 3k, I
would offer to take it ALL off his hands and let him get back to
fighting for say 800p.  Then I take the time to sell it and make the
profit, he gets to go do what he WANTS to do.  Those days are over.
Now that Pally just parks his mule in Bazaar (or himself) while he
sleeps or goes to work.  

The upside is that there is a LOT more available and if you dont have
at least  1k these days by the time you are 15 you are missing the
boat.  Why?  Silk swatches, Leather Padding and Iron Oxide, all of
which are simple to make or get (heck, IO is a GROUND SPAWN) and are
selling for a minimum of around 400p per stack these days up there on
MT.  Heck, the Iron Oxide is selling for a LOW price of 500p, I dont
remember growing up with 500pp ground spawns in EC=)

>and it has killed auction zones off to near nonexistance.

True, unfortunately people are still auctioning in the bazaar LOL
