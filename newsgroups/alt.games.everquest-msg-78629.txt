I imagine its dan days since he mentions doing it with a pally as the
guide does?

One thing:

CrusadersOfGreenmist:  Shadowknight guild (including most Crusaders)

That has 2 different faction levels with two different of the outside
SKS. I got glower dubious to one of the outside sks and am still KOS
to the other (threaten)

Its not really as difficult to make it to trooper mozo as that guide
makes it sound. The crusader aggro is pretty low I guess, but I found
that just hugging that wall to trooper mozo and standing out just far
enough to trade with him I have never had an accident on my dark elf
cleric of inny, my troll sk of cazic or my wood elf druid of tunare.
Once you are there you are pretty much totally safe giving bone chips
if as he says your back is still near that torch on the wall.

Vendor buying out is good for bone chips too, my record is 275 in one
buy out of the gfay newbie lift vendor lady. By "buying out" I mean
the process where you buy out her stacks of junk and destroy them to
eventually get bone chips to show. 

How do you KNOW if she has bone chips? You buy out one slot of player
sold stuff and you sell her one bone chip. If that one bone chip shows
up in the now empty slot, you buy it back and leave because she has no
more. If that one bone chip DOES NOT show up in the now empty spot,
empty more spots then ESC and refresh her again by right clicking, new
stuff will have filled up the empty spots (which players sold her.)

She is my favorite vendor to do this with and usually has metric tons
of bone chips after the server has been up for a while. If you try to
couple this with buying low to high quality pelts (skin the non low
ones) and spiderling silks for making leather padding, you really feel
like you are accomplishing a lot more. 

My wood elf buying out chips mostly from her and then dropping them in
a pack for my dark elf/troll sk is how my dark elf of inny turned in
about 2,500 bone chips to mozo and enough to Lashun novashire and
later the pally guild in qeynos to get the cleric and pally guild of
qeynos to allied ( cleric one for the stupid back item quest which I
have since written off as being too large a waste of time to the point
where I don't even remember the name of it.. ahaha)

A Dark elf iskar friend of mine raised this faction to the point where
he could safely do the iksar shaman quest armor quests in cab to then
sell the armor. Evidently they are not on the same faction as the
shaman guild itself.

Specifically:

"Likewise, there are two shaman-related NPCs in the building marked by
the other red circle, the "Furscale" brothers, who will likewise run
out of their house and attack you no matter which direction you try to
sneak past their abode."

those guys. Wondering how he got to the point where they were enough
indiff to him that he could do the quest while they still attack you?
I think he only turned in 5,000 plus bone chips as a  dark elf of
inny. Maybe scaled mystics is not so KOS for dark elves?

Love the pics of the dwarf standing around the iksars.. ahah
especially sitting above them.

My wood elf druid did something similar with the dismal rage faction
in the freep sewer after finding she was glower in wolf form, but it
took trvially few bone chips and then beetle eyes to get her to allied
in regular wood elf form by comparison. She is now also glower dubious
to evil opal dark briar but I lost interest before making her non kos
in wood elf form to opal dark. I found that my wood elf druid can now
have the full range of the freep sewers more or less as long as she
does not walk into the opal room itself. Anyway she cant raise the
dark elf cleric from inny's faction who is there and would still be
kos when not in wolf form, though the cleric is green so might not
attack (if I ever get opal non kos I might check on that..)
