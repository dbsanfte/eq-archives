True,but highest probability to get an undead 
dungeon is in MMC,although I see a lot of skellies
in Miragul's too with my Ranger.
For my Pally its clear,why he preferes MMC with
all those undeads,Pallies get a self proc for 243
damage vs. undead at level 39 !

On the other hand,I dont care for summoned mobs in
TaK with my Ranger,nuke vs, summoned is only 
25 damge more,ok it has a resist modifier and I think
in my 60 TaK adventures I saw it resisted once.
Self proc upgrade vs. summoned isnt that great too,
170 instead of 150 the normal (magic based ?)
self proc.
