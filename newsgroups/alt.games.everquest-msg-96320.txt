If profitability is truly important to you, then the best suggestion I can
make is abandon tradeskills now, use the money you save to buy yourself nice
equipment.  The one exception I would make, is get your alchemy up into the
80s or so, and make and sell SoW potions.  Alchemy has funded my other
tradeskill habits.
