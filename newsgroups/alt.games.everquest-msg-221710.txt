    I assume we're skipping LoY as an "expansion". ;-)

    Kunark had more people because, surprise surprise, everything about
Kunark was better. The XP was better, the loot was better, it was better.
Yay, mudflation!

    Velious? You have a foggy memory. Soloists moved to Velious en masse, as
did raiders (newest, best stuff available), but the average grouping player
avoided it like the plague it was until the Velks revamp. It didn't help
that the expansion didn't have any low-end content, but Velious was really
bad for grouping. There'd be one group in Iceclad, a few groups pulling the
Ry'Gorr fort, and one or two in Great Divide, and that was it. Post-revamp
the numbers were huge in Velk's and GD, though.

    Luclin? It was a lot like Kunark in terms of XP stuff - better XP in a
lot of places, and better loot. As a raid expansion, though? Very, very
flawed. The word "tedium" best describes Luclin from a raider's perspective.
I'm not surprised that, of all the expansions, the one the most people want
to skip when gearing up a guild is Luclin.

    The thing about LDoN is this: it doesn't have the clear advantage over
previous expansions that previous expansions enjoyed. If you want better XP,
there is someplace else to go - PoP. As long as that is the case, people
will stay in PoP if they value XP over loot (LDoN has better loot than PoP
at the XP level). LDoN is also just being conquered at the raid level
because, unlike PoP where the initial raids in the progression were quite
weak, the initial raids are all very difficult. A lot of people are waiting
for spoilers to filter down to them, or are too busy farming the last
expansion for items.

    When my guild ends raids for the day, almost everyone heads to LDoN. A
few soloists were grinding out AA's to get to the cap, and a few people
would want to do some project like a mini-raid for a friend, but most start
shouting "LFA" the moment the raid breaks up. And even though I get in one
adventure per day average during the week, I have a difficult time
maintaining my overall wins position (just at the bottom of the leaderboard,
hovering around 95th). There's a lot of folks out there pounding out the
adventures.
