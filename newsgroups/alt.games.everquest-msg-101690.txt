I've leveled my iksar monk to 31 and I put my points into 20 into agi and 5
into str.  For iksars you get an AC bonus for agility and 20 extra ac is
very nice.  Stamina is a good choice but i prefer to not get hit over be
able to take lots of hits :)...Also dex and agi effect how quickly your
skills go up defensive and offensive...
