Dear one, I never meant to be IMpolite :)

Uhh... well, I lost "The Hobbit" earlier tonight (and I've been going back
and forth between those books like a wild animal lately! I'm on the Return
of the King, but still going back and sniffing out stuff I had forgotten!
(and yes, that was me you saw on Tolkien.net :) I did go see it again
tonight, and that was my 14th time. That sucks, doesn't it? My sister in
law, who also went with me, pointed out that she had seen Aragorn cut off
the (oh hell, I can't spell it, the thing that shot so many arrows into
Boromir) ARM of the thing... is that true? anyone else seen this? I can't
imagine how I missed -that- 14 times in a row! All I remember is that
Aragorn stuck his elvish blade into the thing's upper thigh, the thing
pulled it out after sufficent beating of Aragorn, thre it at him, after
which Aragorn did the bb trick and whacked it away, more fighting, then he
stuck the sword blade into the thing's chest/stomach, it grabbed it and
pulled him towards him, after which he sliced off its head. Any arm cutting
off in there somewhere that I missed?

No offense intended, Celaeno :)
