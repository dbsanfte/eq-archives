> 24 hour spawn.

Wow, if that is true then things have really changed since I did it over 
2 years ago. It used to be anywhere from 24 to 72 hours and on Sol Ro 
there were so many people waiting to get theirs we had to have guild 
members camped in Nag's Lair 24/7.

Hehehe, one time Nag spawned and we were all teleported to the outside 
(all over level 53). It was pretty damn funny.
