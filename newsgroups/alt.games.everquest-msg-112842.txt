There has only been one time I have been prompted to take a bite out off a
GM's ass and that was during a weekend of hellish disconnects. I was lurking
in the human refuse pool that is the built in EQ client "chat" trying to
determine if there were any other Australians in there noticing severe
timeouts and try to ascertain which ISP's they were using.

After 15 minutes of listening to a GM saying "I am not Tech Support - go
here - ring here - I can't help you go away" a large influx of people all
surged in simultaneously complaining of disconnects and inability to
reconnect for extended times. The GM was repeatedly re-iterating "There is
absolutely nothing wrong with our end - the fault must be your end - ring
your ISP", you know- the standard guff.

Me:    "Excuse me Mr GM, you are not tech support are you?"
GM:    "Yes - that is correct - if you need tech support go here blah blah"
Me:    "And if someone has a technical issue you are not qualified to fault
find it?"
GM:    "That's correct"
Me:    "Then why are you telling people the problem is at their end if your
not qualified to make that judgement?"
...
*long pause*
...
GM:    "There are thousands of people playing without problems"
Me:    "Ahh - thank you for confirming all our suspicions  *sniggers*"

The GM must have hated my guts, but you don't get your cake and eat it too.
If your saying "I can't help you because I am not qualified" then you can't
then say in the next breath on a technical issue "It is definately your
end - our end is fine" and keep any degree of cedibility. You just can't
have it both ways...
