I havent been playing EQ much at all lately, hell, I havent even downloaded
stonebrunt, but after running and downloading all the main patches I had a
problem. Upon clicking 'Play Online' nothing happens, a little egg timer
appears but then...nothing. Anybody have any ideas or solutions for this?
Thanks in advance
