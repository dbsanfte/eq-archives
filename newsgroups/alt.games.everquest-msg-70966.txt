You know, I think you are taking this too much as a personal affront.  Maybe
I missed something, maybe I didnt.  I dont really see where Verant is
telling the players to "bite me".  It boils down to the fact that DirectX
8.1 is required to play the game.  That was unforeseen.  Yes, it should have
been something they knew about.  There are lots of things that lots of
people should foresee everyday, but - being human - they dont.  The way I
see it, Verant's position is "Sorry, but this is the way it is.  We didnt
intend it to be this way.  We understand that not everyone can afford to
make the required changes to their hardware or software at this time.  We
also realize there may be some of you out there that simply don't want to
make the necessary changes.  Due to this, here is an avenue of recourse open
to you, in addtion to all other options you have at this time".

Seems to me that no one is disputing that Verant made a mistake - including
Verant.  However, this being the real world, there are a limited number of
remedies & none are perfect.  So, step down off your soapbox & select the
course of action that most appeals to you.

budget
>  - ask for a refund and not only lose their account but all their
characters
