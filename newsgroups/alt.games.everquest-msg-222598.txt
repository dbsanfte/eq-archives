I have no idea what your logs say, but I know for a fact Oak dished
out every piece of loot he or Rith had, including a CoF to a cleric
and a chain tunic that may have ended up in the bazaar the next day.

Oakrunner is one of the best liked people on test, who leads pickup
raids on his own against targets most people know very little about.
AFAIK he has a standing invitation to tsf if he ever wants to go but
he's stayed loyal to TA and LL. And finally, it's test, and people pay
attention. He's not going to try to hide away loot on a very public gm
event.
