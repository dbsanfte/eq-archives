1st, thx for the help up to this point. I just dinged 2 last night and
enjoyed the killing so much I nodded off at red lights on the way to work
this morning. There really needs to be a disclaimer on the box. :) Anyway,
as a lvl2 halfling rouge, I have tried talking to NPC's in Riverdale about
quests. They tell me the 1st part of their story and I respond to the
[words], but the conversation ends there. I can /h again and the process
cycles. Can someone help?

Tonight I  fish.

Thx.
