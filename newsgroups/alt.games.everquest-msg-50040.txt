Heh. No, it's not all *that* nasty. _Excession_ is positively *nice* in 
comparison, and _The Player of Games_ is hard, but not bleak. _Look to 
Windward_ is also quite balanced in that respect, very poignant in places, 
very funny in others. _Against a Dark Background_ is easily as nasty as 
UoW, though, and not based in the "Culture" universe (which is by far the 
absolutely coolest fictional milieu ever created). Leave that for when you 
are a commited fan. :)

His mainstream fiction is also a matter of extremes: _The Wasp Factory_ and 
_Complicity_ are, although excellent, not for the faint of heart, but _The 
Crow Road_ and _Espedair Street_ are both laugh-out-loud funny.

Banks is definitely one of the best finds in SF, if you happen to start 
with a book that doesn't scare you off. I was pretty lucky my first Banks 
book was _Excession_. I've read pretty much everything he's written since. 
He does have a few books that are clear misses, but even those are much 
better than most other authors best efforts.
