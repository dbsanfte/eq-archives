We had some people go LD on a raid and take a long time to get back on
tonight.  They said they were getting that error.

We also had a strange LD.  It told us that Soandso had gone LD, and it
removed him from the group, and put "LD" beside his name.  However, he was
able to keep moving around and talk to us.  When the usual timeout passed,
he disapppeared.
