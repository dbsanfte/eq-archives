No. But then again, my druid took more than 5 minutes to kill 4 mobs
that gave worthwhile xp. Also note that I've seen 50+ rangers killing
mobs that give them worthwhile xp solo in less than 10 minutes. If
it's taking you 20+ minutes to solo a single mob as a ranger, you're
doing something wrong...
