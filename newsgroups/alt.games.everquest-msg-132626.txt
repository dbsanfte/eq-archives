Certain Shaman (Innoruuk ones I believe) can apparantly get a click
snare item in their diety quest symbol line.  If I were making a shaman
I'd look real hard into this... just as I'd almost certainly go with a
DE cleric for the same reason.  Add Snare to a shaman or cleric and
you vastly improve their soloing capability.

Well, SOW items are readily available, so this is no more an issue for
a well equipped chanter than it is for my cleric.  With the recent pet
changes I'd think chanters would now be pretty decent soloers really,
but then thats pure supposition.

It really is.  The higher you level up, the more time consuming and
annoying it is to move from one hunting area to the next.  Oh sure,
they added in nexus capability... but thats merely an improvement
on the boats, at least with this you don't have to be at the keyboard.
Druids (and wizards) can pop off to a potential hunt area and check
to see if its open, and go to another if it is.  Other classes have to
invest a lot more time and/or energy to do this (or sit alts at all
their potential hunt areas)

Of course this ability was hit with a big nerf stick for Luclin, where
there are no ports, so a druid is no better off than any other
gate capable class.
