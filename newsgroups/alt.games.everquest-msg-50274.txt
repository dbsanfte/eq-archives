some things don't go down in price, but actually go up in price.  various
antques, etc.   This is also true for some items in EQ that were undervalued
initially or later determined to have greater value.  Even these items are
under the pressure of the recession though, which is that their are more
items available than are demanded for.

I'm also talking about mostly the older servers, the newer servers haven't
experienced this as much.
