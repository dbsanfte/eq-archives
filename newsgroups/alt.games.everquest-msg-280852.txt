Lol.

Quite. But look at the brainiac he'd be s suing. Dumb and Dumber.

Small claims court is rarely about big profit. Its about justice. Petty 
justice. :)

This is the rationale scammers operate under. I can do this because 
nobody will put up with the hassle of stopping me. It grates on my 
nerves. I get a real sense of satisfaction out of seeing the stunned 
look on their faces when they called out for it.

While I agree. Letting the scammer get away with it without a fight just 
grates on my nerves. Sue him, write a letter to SOE insisting that the 
account be banned, whatever...
