Nerf is, particularly and simply, taking some aspect of the game that was 
implemented *by design* and reducing its potency, effectiveness or 
desirability as determined by a re-evaluation by the game designers. 

It has nothing to do with what is fun or useful and everything to do with 
what is good for the game in the eyes of those in a position to effect 
change.
