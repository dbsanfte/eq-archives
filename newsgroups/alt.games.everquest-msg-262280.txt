Raiding enchanter? MGB.
A dire charm pet on a raid is more liability than it is worth. Just wait for 
the lvl 66 animation, its about as good as the standard pop dc pet (hitting 
for 149). lvl 66 animation quads for 75, dc pets double for 149 (mostly).

Ive only found 4 zones with really good dc pets. In order of dps...

1) Plane of air. A vengeful airspirit quads for nearly 300
2) Temple of veeshan. The hatchlings double (triple?) for 220
3) Natimbie cragbeasts. Double for 190's
4) Kael. Giant guards double for 169.

Even in plane of air we dont bother with dc pets. Just too much bother. If 
the pet was indifferent and we had /pet hold then it would definitly be 
worth it.
Sumoned animation is good dps, but you should buy all the pet commands 
first. Without /pet back off, you may wipe your raid.
