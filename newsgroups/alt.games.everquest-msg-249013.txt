    Um... why would I hope that?  I hope that EQ2 is a great commercial
success because it the word of mouth about it is that it is a fun game to
play.  And I hope it's a fun game to play because, well, I would like to
have access to a great on-line game, and one that isn't becoming solely
focused on the upper end game for power players.  EQ2 does have a different
development team, you know.  There is a chance, maybe a small one but still
a chance, that they will learn from the errors of EQL and do this game
right.  The president of SOE might not want to see the cash cow of EQL go
udders up right now, but I would bet that he sees EQII as the wave of the
future for SOE's involvement in the MMORPG arena.

    I have to admit, I am not a particularly sentimental person.  I have
played EQ for four years, and have had alot of fun doing so.  However, I
don't feel I "owe" SOE any loyalty at all to EQ Live.  I've paid to play
every month like everyone else did.  I've bought every expansion that came
out up to, but not including, OoW.  Why should I hope that a new, possibly
better for my style of play, game will fall miserably just because it might
threaten EQLive?
