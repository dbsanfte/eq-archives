I don't think this change in itself will have an earth-shattering impact on
the game. That's not the major signifigance I'm looking at here. XP
penalties on hybrids is something VI stated previously was set in stone. Now
they've gone and done a round-about lifting of that penalty. Their method
leaves the bonus in for rogues and warriors because they DON'T WANT TO
"NERF" them. It appears SOMETHING has happened to change the way the team is
looking at things.

( Is it just my imagination, or did the change in thinking start about the
same time old Gordy went to the Live Team? I'm sure it's a coincidence, but
a rather neat one all the same. ;-p )
