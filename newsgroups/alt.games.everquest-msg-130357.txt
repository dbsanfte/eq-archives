Mm-hmm.  Very convenient when I had no idea what my reception was going 
to be in Qey, especially with those two big suspiciously barbarian-
looking guards at the bank (I already knew I was 'scowling' to 
Barbarians).  I also had no idea if there *was* a soulbinder in Qey.  
I've just come back to this game after a long time away, and I'm slowly 
learning which cities have soulbinders and where.

Ryou
