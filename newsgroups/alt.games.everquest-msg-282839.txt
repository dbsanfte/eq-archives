As mentioned, this is a known bug that's been lurking since DX9 was
implemented. More info can be found on the official EverQuest forums.

With the release of PoR, the bug has become much more prevalent. I had
never experienced it until PoR went live. Still, I only seem to
experience it when my system temperature starts reaching critical
levels, and then this is usually the least of my worries ;)
Turning off the computer for a few minutes, letting it cool off, seems
to resolve the issue. This is not the case for all people, though.

My fix is getting a water cooling solution. Air cooling just doesn't
work as well anymore.
