I have an AMD Thunderbird 1.2Ghz based on an Asus KT133(C?) which uses VIA
chipset North and South and I am not having literally any system problems
beyond an occasional drop to desktop in bazaar or zoning from shadowhaven to
bazaar or back again. This is a known glitch though. I am even successfully
further pushing my luck my using W2K with a SB Audigy card.

But - I have suffered your exact problem on occasions and worse on occasion
as in leading to disconnections from game (but not right now) and I also use
Tesltra Bigpond - cable from Brisbane. In just over a year I have had the
problem twice - once for three days and then again for two weeks. The
problem was traced (independant from Teltra - don't try contacting them,
it's useless) down to Testra's DNS servers. They are ad hoc.

All three of their DNS servers are on the <same> subnet. Any person with
even a cursory knowledge of TCP/IP networking knows that is a Very Bad
Thing. Until they start implementing standard networking best practices they
will always have more problems than other quality ISP's.

At the time I had the problem I knew it came down to someone's DNS's as I
had being continously pinging my EQ server and when the the "packet loss"
occured it didn't give "time outs" but "unknown hosts". I passed this info
on to SOE support in the off chance it may have been their ISP's problem
(but suspecting Tesltra) and a good tech from SOE support nailed it directly
down to one of the Telstra DNS's in particular.

Of course we both emailed the info to the black hole that is Telstra tech
support but thankfully DNS problems sort themselves out eventually anyway so
the problem eventually righted itself.

The symptoms were exactly the same. Saying something, zoning or even
"who"ing would fix it temporarily when it wasn't too bad, but when it went
real bad I was getting fully black disconnection screens every half an hour
or so.
