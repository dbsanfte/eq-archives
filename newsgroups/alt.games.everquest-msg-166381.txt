its not a matter of waiting in oot or sro for jboots..its a matter of being
there at the right time...u can walk into zone and he would be up (happend
to me twice)..so it dont take waiting in zone forever to get them..even if
you sit in zone for the little amount of time u play is a good chance you
will get him...not as many people even hunt him sense runspeed's...goodluck
