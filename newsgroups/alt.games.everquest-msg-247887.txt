Definitely, definitely, DEFINITELY!

Argh.  Sorry, But I find that particular misspelling infinately* annoying.

} At that point, it becomes pretty tricky to time your snares. You can do 2
}things to help with that.
}1) each time you cast darkness, start counting aloud to 90.  That way you
}know how much longer snare has left.  Gets a tad annoying after a few hours
}of kiting though
}2) Download a UI timer.  I got one that lets you customize it to the
}duration of your choice. You just need to slide an arrow to the point on the
}timer where you cast snare (on mine at least), and you're golden (would get
}you link, but can't find it atm.. will try to find later)

Actually, what works well for me on timing spells under a couple minutes, 
is having a large round analog clock within viewing distance of the PC.  
If the second hand is facing almost opposite where it was when I cast, and 
I didn't -just- cast, it's probably about 90 seconds and time to recast.
