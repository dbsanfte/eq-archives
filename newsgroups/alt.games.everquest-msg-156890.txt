Your right they havn't seriously nerfed Clerics. They just make them
obsolete Druids and Shaman 75% heals Paladins rezzes up to 75%. Lets give
Druids Rez capabilites then they can rez them selfs when KEI drops while
they are kiting 8 mobs (Yes I have seen it in ME druid kiting 8 Goranga
Gatherers). Most classes have their hands full with 1 dark blue mob. And
Druids are whining about Harmony.
