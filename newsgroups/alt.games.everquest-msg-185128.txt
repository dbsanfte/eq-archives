URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP
             ================================
                     


ATTN:SIR/MADAM, 

I am Lonarh Pulnox, the son of the former Neriak Head of State who
died on the 20th month of his reign while in active services.

Following the sudden death of my father, General X'tronix Pulnox, the
present guild has thrown my family and I into a state of utter
confusion, frustration, and hopelessness. I have been subjected to
inhuman physical and physiological torture, incarceration by the
guards in my country. I was only recently released from the dungeon
after been defeated by a raid from a top tier guild for an drop held
by my late father.

The lackeys of Warlord Olug Abanjo has intensified a probe into my
late father's activities while in the office and he has frozen all our
local and foreign accounts together with other assets of my family as
a retaliation for what my late father did to him when he was alive as
the Head of the Army of Neriak. As a matter of fact, we have been
declared bankrupt and they are not relenting to make us poor for life.

As a man that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody
within my country as all those who benefited immensely during the
regime of my late father have openly abandoned all my family.

MY REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU. 
I got your contacts through my personal research and out of
desperation decided to reach you through this medium.

You must have heard over the media reports and the Internet on the
recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my late father in
different Banks and security firms abroad. Some of these banks and
security firms willingly gave-up/divulge their banking secrets and
disclosed to the present civilian administration of Warlord Olug
Abanjo, all my family's cash lodgement and monetary transactions with
them.

Please my dear, I repose great confidence in you and I hope you will
not betray my confidence in you.

I have secretly deposited the sum of 20K pp with a mule abroad whose
name is withheld for now until we open communications.
 
I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your Bank
account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you only. So I
will deal directly with you.

I am proposing a 20% share of the fund to you for your kind
assistance.

lso this transaction demands absolute confidentiality. On no condition
must you disclose it to anybody irrespective of your relation with the
person. Remember,  Loose lips sinks ships.

I am looking forward to your urgent and positive response via my email
address.

Yours faithfully, 
Lonarh Pulnox
Shadowknight of Neriak
