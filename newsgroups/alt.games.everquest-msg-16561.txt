Subject: Question(s) about different servers and their guilds

I started playing recently, on the Rathe server (just a random choice), but
have now realised that all the servers have different guilds and politics and
was wondering to what extent do they differ from eachother?
Ive read people complaining about 'uber guilds' having control over raids and
high lvl mobs and how some people dislike the control these guilds have over
Norrath life. So i was wondering whether or not these gulids do actually
control much of what happens with raids, and epic mobs, in particular a guy,
druid, who couldnt complete his epic quest because one of his mobs was forever
camped by a guild. This seemed to me to be spectacularly unfair, but then maybe
he was just bitching(?)
My charcters only a low level and im not even in any guild so i dont know if
all ive read is true, but if there are guilds that throw their weight around
alot i find that thought really depressing for reasons i cant be arsed to go
into right now :)
Anyway, as i said i play on the rathe, anybody who has experience of life on
this server please post your thoughts :)
