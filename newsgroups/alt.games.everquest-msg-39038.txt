Hmm, can't remember the exact name, but (hammer? mace) of the
Garou is a +7wis 1hb, kill Midnight, a cougar in Iceclad, and
Garou, a 40ish shaman mob, also in IC, near the ToFS. Give the
drops (bloody cougar bone and skin of the Garou) to the gnoll
shaman near ToFS. Better bring a group with a tracker for the
Garou, though...

Bleah, that was a bit vague, but the quest is in the Allakhazam
database...

Well, he (she?) is questing for the Paw, so I guess
that'll replace the shield. Another thing to consider
is putting the Paw in the weapon hand, and a CGS in the
off hand. Mucho AC that way, and plenty Wis... The paw
is both Primary and Secondary, isn't it?

Much agreement with the rest of the suggestions,
particularly the bracers and the epaulets!

OK, I've snipped the rest, but I can't remember seeing
anything in the back slot. While you're camping the
Ry'gorr BP and the gauntlets, try to get a Cloak of the
Ry'gorr Oracles too, if it's better than what you have
now. 2 wis and some mana, IIRC.
