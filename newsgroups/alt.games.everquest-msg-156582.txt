Lots of people "camp" a single spawn and still can't keep up with the spawn
rate. Lots of people root mobs to hold for later so they can get the
item/cash/exp whatever.
I think Sony needs to drop any kind of camping rules (though I don't think
there are any, just KS'ing) if a mob is NOT engaged it is free for who ever
can kill it. Example would be Paw, so many people sit there camping the
spires. If a mob is not engaged within 2 minutes of spawning anyone should
take it if they can kill it. Seems silly to hold spawns hostage, as I like
to say, the same is with HG's in RM, seafuries in OOT, etc. If you are so
weak you can't keep up with spawns then someone else should be able to take
it out, if you can't handle one spawn in a reasonable time, don't get all
huffy if someone takes your second rooted, undamaged spawn. Yes this has
happened to me, I have rooted that add and moved away and killed the first,
someone took the rooted one. Well move on, I could not have killed it
without meding after the first one, seems silly to tie up a spawn that could
help someone else.
