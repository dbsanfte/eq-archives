Which was of course the context the OP had in mind.  At level 24, he's
not in Howling Stones.

Yes, but you're not dying out of heroism, you're dying right where you
are so that when the camped cleric gets back, your body is right in
front of him.  It's purely a practical consideration.  The gist of the
OP's question as I read it was, do you fight on in a situation where
the odds are starting to seem poor (as he clearly thinks you should)
or do you start cutting your losses, the way his cleric friend does?
Your camping cleric is cutting his losses just as much as a gating one
in Runnyeye.

Sure, we all have.  And we've all also been in TPW's.  One thing I
have seen though, time and time again, is the damaging effect one or
two overly optimistic party members can have.  "Sorry, I was sure we
could handle those guys" is a line I've heard all too often.

So the cleric can only Gate if the whole rest of the party has already
died?  LOL, good luck to him.
