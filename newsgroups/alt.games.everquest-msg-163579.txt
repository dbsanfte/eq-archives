 Yep. At least for what we've been doing, Enchanters aren't that
required other than for KEI. I'm not saying Enchanters aren't required
for PoP. But for the average XP group they really aren't.

 Agreed. How is 50% slow, as opposed to 0% slow, a bad thing?

 It would be nice to have all the classes you need sitting there at the
ready. But you'd be surprised at what sort of ghetto groups some people
have to put together. That's actually the fun part of EQ. The perfect
group is nice and safe. It's also boring. When you have to rely on
Journeymans stick for a Tash and then a ranger or warriors weapon to
proc a slow that sticks... Well that's when it gets a little more
challenging for me. And fun.

  Back in the old days of ST, before revamp, we'd often have no
Enchanters on. Time to break out the Jsticks. Optimal? Efficient? No.
But it sure was a lot of fun. When your Warriors break out the ole
Truncheon of Doom, you know you're not in for a boring time.
