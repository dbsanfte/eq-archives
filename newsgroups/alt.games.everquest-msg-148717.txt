Its not statistically negligible with a Hammer of Judgement, cause
thats better than the swing I generate with Yaulp V.  125 dex
without YV = two or three procs per fight.  200 dex due to
YV = eight or ten procs per fight.

One possible explanation for this would be that each weapon has
an operating dex range, so that what works for one weapon won't
make any difference with another.  As far as I know, I'm the
only one to have proposed such a mechanism, though.  And the
only reason I propose it is that I see a definate major noticable
difference in proc rates with higher dex, while I keep seeing threads
here suggesting that dex makes a negligible difference.

Another suggestion was that small increments of dex make little
difference.  This I can certainly concede; if doubling dex means
quadrupling proc rate, then adding 10% dex would only mean
adding 20% to proc rate, and with a proc rate of two or three
per battle this MIGHT mean one more proc per fight.
