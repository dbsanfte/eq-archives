I just bought a Dell Laptop.  It was on sale for $1400.  It is an Inspiron
8200.

1.8 GHz Pent 4
512 mb RAM
40 gig Hard Drive
Combo DVD CDRW Drive
Mobility Radeon 9000 with 64mb Ram

It weighs 7 lbs (which is kinda heavy) but with it and the wireless hub my
husband installed I can walk around the house while playing everquest.  I
think it works great! I have even put the laptop on a shelf in front of my
exercise bike and worked on trade skills while biking :)
