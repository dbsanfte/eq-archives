But you said yourself, pre-KEI you quit the game for a year.

If thats not having any problems, being skilled or talented...

Face it, your a fuckin moron.  At least try and keep your story the same,
huh?

Well yes and no.  If its just a time game, why can people level to 65 in a
fraction of the time it takes others, even with the same resources?

Im not talking "I leveled to 65 in 2 weeks, playing 8 hours a day" either,
but using the /play time as a guide.  If a level 65 nontwink has 30 days
played, and a level 40 nontwink has 30 days /played, what seperated them
like that?

No you don't.  For starters, Dearic has the ability to read and understand.

He (and many others here) can also do what you claim to be "impossible"
without KEI - keep telling yourself you match them on a skill, knowledge and
understanding level though when you admit you can't proceed without KEI.
