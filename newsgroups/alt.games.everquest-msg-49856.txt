As you can see, even amoung long time players there is SOME disagreement.
But you can also see that
the newsgroups, while a decent source of OPINION, pale when you compare them
to dedicated web
sites. Debates between Enchanters over Charisma vs Intelligence have gone on
since the beginning of
the game, and not everyone has had the same experiences. Best advice, ask
questions here, research them
at some of the more popular websites (both mentioned in this thread are
GREAT!) and then go out and
experiment. You will think that soloing will level you up faster, but in
truth, because of mana downtime,
an enchanter is best in a group. Provide support for them and control the
traffic around them and you will
find yourself leveling faster and dying MUCH MUCH less.
