From the shadows, the mysterious "Sebet" <no@mail.for.me> (if that IS

If you gave it in another thread, you can't expect me to have noted
and remembered it. There's a lot of people here.

You still havent given it, either.

Yes.

What makes you think I'm an amateur?

As you wish. Your personality is grating and bitter. No one likes
being around someone like that. This also might have something to do
with why you can't level.

Also, you seem to have an obsessive need to get the last word in in
this.
