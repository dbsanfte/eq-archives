Normally when people do evil city raids, neriak is the target...dunno why.

For a long time, camping bouncers at the zone line was excellent xp, but
when verant gave steroids to newbie guards, this stopped.

Possible, but heavily unlikely.

Not really, no...raiding in those places would be a major nightmare. Most
guildmasters are 60+, and the merchants in old world cities are not only
hard to kill, but poof into nothingness when they die. Concentrations of
mobs are also VERY high...it would mostly be a suicide run.

Hell, the level 60+ warders in the sleeper's tomb most common drop is a
cloth cap...and that is a 55+ zone that requires a lengthy quest to get the
key to access, and contains the most difficult mob in the game. I doubt
that oggok would much improve on this.
