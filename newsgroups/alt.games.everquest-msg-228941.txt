Pre 46 I gave 20plat for Temp... now I give 30 plat for Virtue, and 35 to
40plat for extended Virtue since it lasts just a bit longer.  Sometimes
lately its getting nearly impossible to find Virtue though so maybe its time
to start paying a little more???  Wish my 49 Warrior was an Umber Twik so I
wouldn't need buffed as much.  Oh well maybe someday I'll be rich enough to
afford top of the line gear or be able to hunt the planes etc`...  lol
