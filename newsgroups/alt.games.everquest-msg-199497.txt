I recently lost my sound, thinking it had something to do with WINXP I
de-installed xp and re-installed it. Now I have no audio and my video
works, but not with EQ. It was working fine before. I get the
"EQgame.exe has experianced a problem and needs to close, we're sorry
for any inconvenience" message. Does EQ work with integrated video
(Mine is SiS) and if not why would it work fine and then just not
work?
I have been out of game for over a freaking week now and I'm going
goddamn nuts!!
