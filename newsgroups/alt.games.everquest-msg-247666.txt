 Yes it is the same thing. You want people to come in and kill things
without asking then find another mmorpg. Theres no place for it in EQ.

 It is VERY relevent. If someone was there this would not have taken
place. See?

 not required to but you yourself called EQ a 'social game'. Thats
akin to somone coming to the drive in and park in front of you
blocking your view so they can see the movie.

 If you were there first I wouldn't stay. See thats how I play, and
damn well expect others, to play EQ.

 Read the above. I zone into OTT I do one of those 'camp checks'. If
its taken I leave since there is squat of interest for me to do. Even
if your on your way and lie about it being taken I'd leave. There
would be no 'engaement' by me whatsoever.
