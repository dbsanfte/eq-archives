Same here. Both computers crashing. Can not be a virus be cause my second
computer has just been set up from scratch (spare part rebuild) Installed EQ
direct from new discs so that I could 2 box.
Thought it might be a 2 box problem at first but even if I am just playing solo
on the main I get freqyent -EQUclient crashes.
