I just today found myself in that position of having to gate away from the
group to avoid certain death and I think I was right to do it (in this
circumstance).  New to lower guk I joined a group and was guided to the sage
room.  We broke the room and I ended up dying.  I don't blame the group for
that.  It was partly my fault for not keeping track of my health bar and not
shouting for help.  Got a revive and moved on.  A little while later someone
suggested we move to the sav room (whatever that is).  So I tagged along.
Soons we get there one of us goes afk to pee.  Just then 2 shin ghoul
knights or something like that appear and start beating on us.  One on one
tank and one on the other tank (afk).  It appeard to me that only the one
tank was doing anything, so others might have also been afk.  Tried to help
the guy but only succeeded in getting the mob pissed at me.  Now I am
yelling for help and trying to root it but failing.  Down to 2 bubbles of
health I gated.  I just could not afford two deaths in 15 minutes and was
not going to take it.
