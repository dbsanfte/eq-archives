I might be a bit slow, but i was under the impression that a new color 
scheme was applied as to sepparate the green cons from the blue ones.

The 'cyan' color was, as i understand it, supposed to be replacing the 
green cons that still gave exp, from the green cons that would yield 
nothing at all.

Now - Yesterday happily hunting in QH, i found that some greens still 
gave exp, but the cyan ones gave nothing at all.

Is it me that got it all wrong or .... Any comments?

Good Hunting all.
