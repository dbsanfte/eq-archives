I should file a bug report too. A friend of mine, a DE SK, had found
the merchant conned dubious and refused to trade with him. Wondered
why that was. Maybe it was some kind of faction problem?

I checked out the merchant with a brand-new DE necromancer. The
merchant conned dubious to me and refused to do business and the
merchant is a DE as well.

So a merchant has been provided in Nektulos Forest but newbie dark
elves can't do business with him.

LOL
