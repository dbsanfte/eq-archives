"But don't think for a second that we don't see WoW as both a great game AND
Blizzard as serious competition.
Personally. I'm glad they are out there. They keep us honest. They keep us
focused and they force us to play with our 'A' game. They've certainly
opened some eyes in our company to styles of gameplay that are different
than we would have come up with inside SOE. I hope they're also opening up
the eyes of other MMO developers that the 'old school' probably won't cut it
any more. I'm glad that we went in the direction we did with EQ II because
had we stuck with making an even "harder core" game, I think bad things
would have happened. We need to be about larger scale mass-entertainment.
because that's what online gaming is slowly becoming. Our games just need to
be fun. and easy to get into."

I interpret that as: "We're going to keep dumbing it down until any idiot
can play and succeed just by putting time in. Sigil better take note because
'old school' ironman MMOG's are out! Roll on the corporate mass market, the
Hollywood of MMOG's!"

Cheers,
James
