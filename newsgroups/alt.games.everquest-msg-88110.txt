Actually, with a little patience a Vah shir (any class) can get
to GFay with no problems.  I was hunting in Paludal yesterday
(wanted to see that xp bar move!) with my BL, when a low level
vah shir ooc'd asking (several times) if someone would invis him
so he could get to shadow haven.  I wanted to try something fun,
so I tried to sneak from Hollowshade to Shadowhaven.  I was almost
there when I aggroed a fiend.  Pulled off the longest - twistiest
strafe run to the shadeweaver zone you ever did see :)  Was so
low on hp when I zoned, that my buffs and the disease dot dissappeared.
Undaunted I tried it again, and had zero problems on that route
getting to Shadowhaven.
