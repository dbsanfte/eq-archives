I agree, Qeynos is my Warriors Second home, in fact he is more popular there
than in Neriak.
My only problem is Bards, I criticised Travis one too many times, I think
but I am currently massacring the occupants of Mistmoore to try and fix that
situation (figure I'll put Buffy out of Business before they stop attacking
me)

Qeynos is one of those places that will make you appreciate things like,
SoW, Ports and PoK...or should I say WK is one of those places.
