Buy the following.

EverQuest:  Gold Edition UK

As listed above you said it comes with all the Modules prior to Planes
of Power.  This is all you need if you just want to play the game.
One thing to consider though with the module Planes of Power.  It has
some new spells and also has the Planes of Knowledge Books.  These
books are Teleporters that you can use to get around to the major
cities and the nexus in EQ.  So I would strongly suggest you also get
Planes of Power if you plan on playing the game for awhile.  Makes
getting around so much quicker.
