"Bazaar has a 500 person limit.  500 people set up afk traders while they go
to work, sleep, raid on another account, etc.  Do you have to camp the
Bazaar until a server reset to get a spot?"

You're an idiot, just admit it.  Or do you think your "transparant" attempt
to deflect around a semantic straw man somehow rises above the level of
pathetic that it obviously is?
