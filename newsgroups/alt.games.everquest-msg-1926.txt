He did do the apologize for stupidity quest, now if he does the Make
Nice to Lokari quest, he may get back to Dubious with everyone else, 
And if he does it properly, he may be able to keep his Faction with
UsenetTrollsII above indifferent.  I guess the NG is like Velious, you
can't have everyone like you.  Although, the FansOfLokari, and Tailoring
Faction Groups are pretty large.
