To be honest, from the *solo* player's point of view, I'd rather kill light
blues mobs *all* day with hardly any downtime at all than kill one blue mob
and then sit on my backside medding up for ten minutes in-between kills.
Killing mobs regulaulary with little or no downtime is A) much more fun B)
more rewarding in the way of loot, even if that loot is only a 5pp drop and
C) experience bringing.

You've hit the nail on the head when you use the word *convenient* - that's
just it, Wizards are all too often seen as the convenient way to get from A
to B. You can *still* get to virtually any location *without* the help of a
Wizard, so my point is, our porting abilities have been diluted somewhat.

Point taken, and I think that this should be looked into.

I think what needs to be done (outside of skilltrading) is to give *every*
class a spell (buff or whatever) than can be *so* much wanted (like KEI to
give example) that they can earn a decent crust from. To give you another
example, as I solo 99% of the time I never get decent loot, not ever. I
cannot fight in dungeons well, simply because of the Wizard's need to snare
and nuke. Most Wizards stay well away from dungeons when solo playing. Yes
you'll get level 60's with Epic's there, but as a rule of thumbWizard's
don't solo in dungeon's well. To my point though, Clerics can rez, Chanters
can buff. Wizards can port and bind, though *now* both of these things are
no longer totally unique due to the Scions portals and Soulbinders. Wizard's
often don't get the chance to loot when grouped either, simply because they
stand away from the mob. I've grouped and I'm sad to say that even when a
loot agreement has been decided I always get crap loot given to me, even
though my contribution in damage was extremely high.

I'm not arguing that Wizard's aren't powerful, not at all. A Wizard does not
really get *very* powerful until the end-game, Mana Burn takes rather a lot
of AA points to get, and from the solo Wizard's point of view that's a *lot*
of down-time. Consider this, a Mage, a Wizard, a Necro and an Enchanter all
on a small island filled with light-blue mobs. The Mage, Chanter and Necro
can now solo these mobs virtually non-stop whilst never running out of mana,
no down-time at all. A Wizard might be lucky to *find* a mob to kill on the
island, and if he *is* lucky to find a spare mob, it still takes him a
bucket-load of mana to kill it. See my point?

Kind regards to you all ..

Stevie.
