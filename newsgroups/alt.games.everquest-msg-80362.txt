Hi All,

Am kinda a newbie in Everquest....Am working on my guild's fourth
quest - Bring back 2 Goblin Hunter Javelins, and 2 Sarnak Broodling
Fangs, but finding any Sarnak Broodlings is proving tough. I know I
have to look in the Lake of Ill Omen, but how deep do I need to go? I
practically circled the lake, an area my level 18 Beastlord does not
belong in! However, I had nice buffs from someone (Chloroplast, and
SOW, and others). Where the heck are these things? Do I actually have
to go to the Sarnak Fortress (in which case I would have to be at
least level 30)?

Thanks!

Geckool (Iksar Beastlord)
