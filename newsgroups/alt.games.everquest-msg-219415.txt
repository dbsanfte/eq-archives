Hehe... you caught me *just* as I was going to write "Monual's Hard
Adventure" about my Mistmoore LDoN.  It sounds so similar to yours, though,
that I'll let you have the spotlight for now.  =)

Yeah, I need to do that.  I wanna get Greater Remove Curse, which is only
available with Guk points.  Alas, no one wants to do Guk.  I have seen GRC
for sale in the bazaar - for 130K - 150K.  Nice try guys, I'll get the
points myself.

That's pretty good timing.

Yeah, y'know, Monual had no clue what enrage meant for the longest time
either.  Some things you have to experience for yourself to understand.

I get tells asking for Temperance all the time and I have to patiently
explain that there was no reason for me, a 65 Cleric at the time LoY came
out, to have done the Temperance quest.  An amazing number of people don't
even know it's a quested spell.

You did quite well without Virtue.  Hats off to your cleric for having the
dual challenge of keeping your buffs up and keeping you alive.  =)

I almost never lead a group, I prefer other people put groups together.
Takes a certain kind of management skill to be able to lead a group well.

Hehehe.  I forget who it was that posted the rules for a Naggy raid, one of
which was, "Before the raid, the clerics will do a '/who ranger' and make
hotkeys from the names to make rezzing easier."  If your cleric had the
ranger's name hotkeyed, then it was a raid.   =)
