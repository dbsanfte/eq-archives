Equestrielle is KOS to EVERYTHING. Wolf form, however, makes you non-kos to 
brownies (a good thing!). DEFINITELY wait until you have wolf form (and 
track at a decent level, Rancorous Ghasts are uncommon spawns in a large 
zone and they only spawn at night). Also, whenever in LFay, I always 
( ALWAYS ) keep Spirit of Cheetah memmed. In fact, any time you are soloing 
Cheetah is a good idea. Basically if the shit hits the fan you click off 
wolf(IMPORTANT, Cheetah will not overwrite it!) and hit Cheetah (Disgusting 
speeds for little mana with a .5sec casting time) and hightail it outta 
there. 

That said, be prepared to wait a loooong time to get 4 ghast hearts. At 30 
you can hunt (with harmony) things like Shadowed Men. Also, you can lay 
some serious smack down on Thistle Underbrush (DO NOT ATTEMPT BEFORE 29!) 
by making sure you have full mana and are buffed with your Coat and your 
Skin, then running up to him, dropping your two dots and then Combustoing 
him into a smoking heap. He IS a Druid with all the 24th level spells- 
expect DOTs, burns, roots, and some melee(but not enough to warrant wasting 
mana on thorns), he basically does what you did at 24 without the 
restriction of running out of mana. He is worth killing though, because he 
drops Braided Ivy Cords, a non-lore Druid Bard and (I think?) Monk 
shoulderpiece- 4ac 5 wis. 

Hope all that helps :)
