It really depends on if the GM or guide see is (nearly impossible) or
if its someone who gets reported a lot so they MIGHT bother to keep an
eye on them. Its kind of hard to really scam someone in this game. 

Verant used to have the login message as "don't take a trade from
someone who will be logging on "another character" to pay you" etc.

Basically its largely buyer beware. here are the basic rules I follow
to never be scammed:

1) Have drop confirmation on, so you can't accidently drop stuff
(Caution: you still WILL drop money, which is why # 2)

2) The person selling the ITEM, ALWAYS puts that in the trade window
first. NEVER put the cash in the trade window without someone putting
in an item first. Some people sidestep or something when they think
you are, boom pick up cash.

3) NEVER fall for the bags trick. The bags trick is where someone goes
"okay let me see that bag of items please" you do then they go "okay
now let me see that one item you mentioned" you do then they go "okay
let me now see that other bag" you do. Boom, they cancel the trade and
since bags go back into inven first or something that item drops to
the ground since you were out of spaces in inventory. They pick up the
item and run.

4) Due to #3, never trade with bags AT ALL, EVER, JUST DON'T DO IT.
Its not worth it, sometime you will be tired and forget. Trade single
items. Moreover only let a person LOOK AT a single item at a time. If
they want to look at 3 items go through letting them look at EACH ONE
one at a time, then cancel. 

5) even following these rules be on the look out for the old
Wurmslayer type items which won't fit into a normal bag so they need a
base inven slot. What I do is carry a deluxe sewing kit which holds
GIANT items. The large sewing kit you can still buy is the same. You
can't combine stuff accidently in them now so bonus. I keep several
slots free in the kit at all times and I even always have at least one
inven slot free. You can't be too careful.

6) never, ever, never fall for the "my other character will pay" "my
friend will come and pay" etc. If they don't have the money to pay
themselves, they don't get it. Tell them "okay, get your other char
and I'll sell it to them." If they keep trying to get you to do
otherwise and feel strongly about it, they are trying to scam you just
stop trying and move along. 

7) even if someone is offering money for services to me, such as a
teleport, they pay me first. If they balk at that say this:

"I'm a high level druid which is why you asked me for a port, you know
that I can port but I don't know that you have 50 plat or that you are
going to pay it to me. If you don't want to pay me first good day to
you then."

Yeah, it may make you seem like a jerk but I've been stiffed several
times by people when I would have rather been playing for myself and
not taken the time to port them for free. I always make it a habit to
pay clerics first for resses, once again I know that they can res..
they said they were going to res.. its pretty safe to pay them first.

8) this one is probably the least irritating of these but it still
gets me, this is the "I can't take this mob on my own, but wil con you
with a set up since you are the mark at which time I will come out
ahead, hah ha on you"

This happened to me just recently and irked me. I'd been going to the
jade chokadai prod guy in Lake of ill about 4 times in a day and it
was always camped. Finally I come and its up and one druid guy is
looting his corpse. He says he has tried to kill it 6 times but always
dies. I say "well, that probably means you should really come back
when you are higher and can kill it"

He pulls the "please help me kill it?" 

I try to be strong at first and plainly state "well, I am here to kill
it as well and have been checking it several times today. No one else
is here to help you and by your own admission you can't do it alone. I
know that I can and I want the prod. Really the mob should go to me in
terms of fair play."

Its basically like I said nothing at all and he continues "please help
me kill it?"  "ill pay you 300 plat"  Okay, now the set up is
starting, which I FALL FOR. See I owe a person 1 k plat and for some
reason lately was having a hellish time selling even pretty good items
CHEAP. So I agree.

"Okay, I will help you kill it, you loot the prod you give me 300
plat."

After the kill he first says something about having to go to the bank
then says "oh this item is worth 300 plat or more" and hands it to me.
I say I want the 300 plat and he shuffles and stammers and such and I
see where things are going and finally just drop it. Yeah, what I
really needed was more crap to sell. So I say "okay later" since I
really just don't want to bother with them anymore at that point.

After auctioning in many zones I finally managed to sell the crappy
thing for 200 plat... so not a total loss. See but now what happens?
In the future my behavior will be altered and someone will think I'm a
real A hole when they can't take a mob but I won't help them because I
want to take it. If you can't take it, don't expect help. Its not like
some kind of a line where a level 5 person can be at the sarnak guy
with the prod an has rights because he was there, if he dies and he
can't take it he should give it up.
