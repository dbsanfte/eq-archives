It's possible you just got lucky - skills seem to have a better chance
of an increase on a successful skill check than a failure, and it is
generally a right royal bitch to get from 0-1 in anything without
kickstarting it using a training point. However, it is possible, at
least for tradeskills etc.

Perhaps it is so tough to get from 0-1 that most people who forget to
train the skill never get that initial point, whereas you lucked the 1
in 10000 chance (or whatever) for a skillup when going from 0 to 1.

FWIW, my first character, a ranger, never got a skillup in taunt despite
constantly mashing the hotkey, until he trained a point in it at about
level 12 (!)
