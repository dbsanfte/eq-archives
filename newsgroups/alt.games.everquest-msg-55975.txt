This is indeed an instance of someone telling you how to play your
character, and giving bad advice.  No, they likely do not understand.
However, you should listen to the group leader, if you have one,
or discuss song strategy with the group if its more democratic.

Depending on group composition, playing mana song always is
sometimes a good plan... but even then, theres no reason not
to be twisting in a couple other songs at the same time.  -Which-
other songs to twist in is also a strategy question, and not
necessarily one that you should be deciding all on your own.

If you play an enchanter at low levels, for example, you rapidly
learn to despise bards who don't know what they are doing,
as your primary plan when overrun with mobs is to mez the adds,
while the lowbie bard's primary plan is to AE damage them all.
Having a unified strategy here is crucial, the two approaches are
diametrically opposed.

Fear kiting mobs is an excellent plan, even in a full group, if that
is what you are doing on purpose.  It makes fairly lousy
crowd control, though, if thats the plan, someone didn't talk
much.  Often randomly feared mobs are the result of someone
working on their Instill Doubt skill, which hardly ever succedes...
and is often a nasty surprise when it does.

Bard, on the other hand, might not be the best choice to
eliminate runners.  Since your songs boost the performance
of all your group members, going out of range pulls them
-all- down a notch (or two or three... how many group
songs were you twisting?)  Anyone else running out of
song range only degrades one member's performance.
Better, runners should be rooted, mezed, snared, nuked
into oblivion... your choice, but from the safety of the
group.

This is nothing but ignorance.  Wasn't, on the other hand,
an effort to tell you what to do.  Sure would be nice if
it worked, wouldn't it?

Again, not exactly telling you what to do.  But... if you
are relying on Selo's for speed, then you are taking
one song out of rotation.  You can only mem 8, after
all.  And you can only sing 3 (or four if you are in
perfect tempo) at a time.  SOW, being faster than
almost every mob you face, will get the job done
and leave you more able to boost the group's performance.

Only time my bard ever turned down SOW was when
travelling cross country.  Sure, SOW feels like walking
in mud, but it gets the job done unless you are pulling
Grimfeather or a Snow Griffon (or a few other SOWplus
fast mobs)

If you are pulling, the mobs only run so fast, Selo's
won't get em to the group any faster... even with SOW
on you may have to pause to keep them following
you.  If you aren't pulling, then movement speed is
primarily only for emergency getaways... and unless
you are very low on health, SOW is more than
adequate for that purpose.

Hmm, if you are in an outdoor zone with a long run
to find a mob, Selo's does have its advantages; yes,
SOW is fine for getting the mob back, but Selo's
lets you find the mob in the first place faster.  So
again, its a strategic descision.  But it sure isn't an
ignorant one like Clarity.  Its also easy to click off.

Sorry, knee jerk response, heck, I'll make the
devil's arguement on almost any point!  Its amazing I'm
still married, I think.
