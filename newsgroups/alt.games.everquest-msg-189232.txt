Yeah.  As it stands now, we have six clerics who have HoV, so all runes are
being turned in for other classes atm.  A druid was quite happy last night
to be awarded PotN.

I myself have all of my 65th level spells after picking up Mark of the
Righteous for 40k - a more reasonable price, IMO.  I now have everything but
Silent Command and Hand of Virtue - and all without ever having turned in a
single rune.  There are some happy folks that I've made thousands of plat
richer, though.

You need three other parts, actually.  Broken Skull Blood from Blackhands;
Pure Blood from luggalds; Gulf of Gunthak Water from mobs around the fort in
Gunthak.  Expect to spend several hours farming these, unless you can get a
group to come AE the mobs for ya.

Ah, didn't know that.  Thanks for the info.

I went back on Saturday and completed the quest.  This time I had Mark of
the Righteous - 34 hp DS - and a shaman in our allied guild was kind enough
to make a few DS potions for me - 33 hp.  So every time a mob hit me, they
would do 68 points of damage to themselves.  That made the fights go *much*
faster.

I also had a rogue volunteer to come help me.  After he arrived, the first
luggald we killed dropped Pure Blood (this after I'd already spent hours
there soloing).  He remarked, "Well, that was easy."  He then accompanied me
to the Blackhand area where we spent the next two and a half hours killing
the mobs there.  I gave him one of the DS potions and he himself was amazed
how much damage the two Damage Shields were doing.

At the end, he was getting pretty bored - I kept telling him he was free to
leave at any time, but he stuck it out - and then he asked, "Are you sure
these are the right mobs?"  I told him that I'd checked and double-checked
all my online sources.  Just to prove my point, the very next mob we killed
dropped the blood.  =)

So be prepared for long boring no-XP camps - oh, but you're an epic cleric.
You're already used to that.  ^_^

Yup.  =)   And thanks for the congrats.  I've been really really happy with
them; everything is so *clear* now.  I still can't get over it.

Hehehe... belated happy birthday.

While by far the majority of players are younger than us, there are still
plenty of folks in our age group.  I knew one online family that included a
husband and wife and the husband's grandfather.  Sometimes it's nice to seek
those kind of folks out just to kind of relax and chat.
