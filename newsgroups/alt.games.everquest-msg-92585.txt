My big question is...why are you bitching at all?  You had to wait 40
minutes...yeah that does suck but that's how things work in EQ.  If you have
any friends in game undoubtedly some of them have mentioned in passing where
they've had to wait hours (rarely, thank god).

After 40 minutes a guide/gm responded and gave you a Customer Service rez
(full health, full mana) and told you not to move your corpse next time.

What's the problem?  His/her attitude?  Get over it, life's too short to
bitch & moan about someone's ATTITUDE when things turned out to your
satisfaction.
