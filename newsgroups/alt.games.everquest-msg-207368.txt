Just announce in "/gu" that you want to hunt there and are looking for
interested people. There may be several people instested in going for
exp, loot, or just the challenge of it. If not, no harm done. Asking
if people are interested is not the same as tring to organize a guild
raid, or expecting them to hold your hand through the encounter. It
should in no way reflect poorly on you as a "probationer".

If the revamp drastically ups the level or group requirements for the
zone, the odds are the quest mobs will be moved somewhere else. This
is what happened when they revamped CT. The drops you are looking for
might even be easier to obtain post revamp.
