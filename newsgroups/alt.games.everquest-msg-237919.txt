From the shadows, the mysterious "Lief" <ask.me.for@it.com> (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>From the symptoms (ack how do you spell that ^_^) you describe, it sounds
>more like a Frames Per Second problem, most likely your graphics cards
>drivers.

Yeah. Whoever started this problem of calling framerate issues "lag"
should be shot. They are unrelated and the solutions are completely
different. Your T3 connection doesn't give a shit if there's too many
things for the graphics card to draw, and your fancy 256 MB Nvidia
doesn't give a shit if the server is bombing you with 10 MB a second
in information.

The poster has a framerate issue. It smells like a driver or DX
problem. He might want to *downgrade* drivers if he's using cutting
edge ones.

Oh, while I am contemplating shooting people, I would also add users
of the horrid kekekekekethxla~ emoticon you used to the list: ^_^ -
reminds me of nothing more than the battlenetrats - the absolute dregs
of humanity.
