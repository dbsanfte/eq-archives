Yes.  Especially for a cleric or enchanter.   For one of those two surviving
an extra hit means the difference between success and a wipe more often than
"casting that one extra spell."

Maxing Intelligence and Wisdom while wearing KEI is trivial.  Even with the
old gear it wasn't too hard.   Today you would have to actively work at it
to have a level 65 caster not sitting at max intelligence / wisdom.

This is true for every stat for every character.    The initial 20 points
are pretty meaningless compared to everything you will get from what you are
wearing.   That is why the smart move is to put them into stamina.   Stamina
gear is generally the hardest to come by, and costs the most.
