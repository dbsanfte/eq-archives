I don't like this latest patch at all. I've been so happy with the game and
had very few complaints until now. This just plain sucks.

Why make ALL quested gear attunable? Isn't that a little drastic? Couldn't
they figure out a better way to encourage people to buy player made gear
than such a sweeping change? I was looking forward to passing on a few rings
and such to my alts instead of doing all of the same quests over again. I
won't buy player made gear for them when there are questable items. Why
would I buy gear that my character is going to outgrow quickly? Mabye at
higher levels, but what is the point of attuning all the low end stuff? Are
there any players even making stuff for lower levels anyway?

New fuel?? Why? Now there are just more things to scroll through on the
merchant menu, and I have to figure out which fuel to buy. If they wanted to
increase the cost, why not just create a guild fee to use the equipment? Or
maybe you have to use multiples of fuel. It's just a big pain and more
running back and forth to the merchant.

Good-merchants buy back unused items for cost.  At least I can get those
items out of my inventory instead of hanging on to them because I might use
them and I hate to resell them at a loss.

Players can now make their own component items. hmmm..... this needed some
work, but this also seems to be overkill. I think there should be some
interdependency, but it was umbalanced among the classes. The didn't all
have the same dependencies. What needed fixing was not getting rid of all of
them, but making sure the classes were balanced.

New con system?? Why? What was wrong with the old one? The new one is just
different, it's not better, and I dont' understand why time was wasted on
fixing something that wasnt' broken, when there are broken things that
haven't been fixed. What is easier to understand at a glance? The
differences in "fanciness" of the con window, or the number and direction of
arrows?

I don't like all the tents and crap all over Antonica. There is no rhyme or
reason to it. They are just stuck out there and don't make sense. I guess
this is for the new sabotage quests, but I don't like the way it's been
implemented. It's kind of like coming home and finding that someone has
rearranged all of your furniture.

BTW- has anyone noticed that you can't seem to swap items in your inventory
any more? If you grab an item and put it in a slot where another item is, it
won't switch them like it used to. You have to take the item out and put the
other one in the empty slot.

Over all, I HATE this patch and wish we could roll back the clock and
pretend it never happened. I just hope this is not a sign of things to come.
