/tell will not work.

Only /g will work, and you have to be in the same zone.

You can train someone to one skill level higher than your current skill.

Skill levels don't register until you zone.

So as long as one person has at least one skill point in a language, they
can train themselves and someone else to excellent.

Person A spams Person B until B stops getting skill increases.  At this
point, B's skill is one point higher than A.

Both zone.

B spams A until A gets exactly 2 skill increases.  A is now one point higher
than B.

Zone again.

A spams B until B gets 2 skill increases.  Zone.  Later Rinse Repeat.
