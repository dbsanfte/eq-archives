	Ok title says most of it.... I have only been on one other
raid and it was to Tower of Frozen Shadow (ToFS).  Which ended within
5 min with Everyone being dead except a Necro.  A second guild had to
come in and rescue everyone.

	Ok I have been invited on a Vox raid, as I understand it... I
will be going to permafrost.  I know about the begining... Junk buffs
first then good ones (because vox strips 5 buffs at a time I hear).

	If you have any info that can guide a 49 Cleric to success, if
not to just ensure I dont make a fool of myself, Your time would be
appreciated.    
	
	The raid is to be this eveing or on the marrow depending on
when Vox spawns. 
		
	Oh and if you have any links for guild websites ect that have
a good Raid breakdown for this zone Id appreciate it..


thanks
