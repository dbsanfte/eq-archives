The only issues I would consider there is Troll = bad xp penalty, Ogre = 
worse xp penalty. I've also heard of Ogre SK's having trouble casting some 
spells when they get them due to such a small mana pool. I think it was 
just early on though. You could easily dump a few point into INT or grab 
some INT gear to help as well.
