Nope. My point was the fact that it is very tempting to just fire up a 
second account when the new expansion gives you all you need for it. Of 
course doing so also means you'll need another copy of the expansion for 
your first account. If you don't quit, you're most likely going to buy 
the expansion before too long, and if you buy the expansion, they go to 
great lengths for little investment to entice you to buy it twice.

However, it's moreso because of their well-known tendency to sell 
expansions primarily by offering select features to buyers that they 
should be getting anyway like extra bank slots, shared bank slots, a 
ninth spell slot, a bazaar zone, etc. None of those except remotely 
possibly the bazaar zone, warrant an expansion to offer them to their 
loyal customers, yet SoE treats those fundamental features like just more 
teats on the udder of their cash cow.

Don't get me wrong, I played for quite some time with this understanding. 
No one likes to talk about how they're being bent over until they finally 
find reason enough to put an end to it. Call it getting your money's 
worth, if you like. I did as well for years, and from my own perspective 
it was actually true up to a point. /shrug

All that aside, do you honestly dispute the notion that fleecing its 
customers is standard operational procedure for SoE? I think that's been 
pretty well established for some time now.
