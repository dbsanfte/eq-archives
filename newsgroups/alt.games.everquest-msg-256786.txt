Actually, I did a bit of testing...   (More of a "Hmm, so thats why my proc
messages aren't showing up, let me change that" actually, but don't tell
anyone.)  It appears that the spellcasting results are tied to the "Mine"
filter.    The only way to move the spellcasting results to another window
is to move your own casting to that window.

This is probably an unintentional glitch that we can get fixed though.   So,
/bug it if those commands are still in the game.   Cause tying it to that
filter makes no sense to me.
