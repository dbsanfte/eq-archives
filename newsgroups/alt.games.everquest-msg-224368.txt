The way I understand it, once each tick or each incidence of the mob taking
damage (with the sole exception of DoT damage) the mob is granted a resist
check to see if it breaks root.

I've only rarely played a character that has root, and almost never a
character that can cast root at level 60+.   But I have attacked rooted
creatures often.  High level versions of root seem to have a chance of
holding up a good time even under melee and DD, but they generally break
much faster when the mob is being meleed.  And "under level 60" versions of
root tend to break immediately during melee.

Actually, thats not really the best way to test it, as I believe 5 melees
attacking with any kind of weapon would break it pretty fast.

A better test would be to root the mobs and leave them alone several times.
Then root the same type of mob and send in melees with the fast weapons.
If melee does not break root, then the two durations should be the same, on
average.
