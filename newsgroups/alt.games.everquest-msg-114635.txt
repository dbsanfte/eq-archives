Up to skill 175, Freeport is the best place to practice
smithing.  Above 175, the Bazaar is the *only* place
worth using.  FP molds and FP ore are six zones
apart on Antonica, and four zones apart on Faydwer -- they're
both in the same zone in the Bazaar.  Before Luclin,
175+ smithing was a nightmare.
