my husband is the only one other than myself that has the passwords to 
both my accounts[he has one character on one account which started out 
as his account...oops=)], my game husband has the password to my 
secondary account. the only reason that christian has the secondary 
password was an emergency neet to transfer some items that i did not 
want to risk dropping on the ground and we were under a time constraint. 
besides, i trust him implicitly=)

OK sony, come and get me.....

margali
and i do change my passwords monthly by randoming in a thesaurus for them=)
