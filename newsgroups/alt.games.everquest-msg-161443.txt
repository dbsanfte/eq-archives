On Rallos, just watch out for two guilds mostly if they're still
around: The Peacebreakers (Though, after some crap their leader
pulled, they might have finally been forcibly disbanded) and Flowers
of Happines (I am almost certain they were disbanded forcibly.)

Those were the worst of the greif-uberguilds on the server. Point is,
there are VERY notable exceptions to your observation...
