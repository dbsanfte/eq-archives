there are more quests as promised during beta.  There was a level 6 food 
or drink quest added to each starting city, you choose which you get. 
Level 10, not sure if that was in during beta.  Level 15, 20, 30 you get 
quest from your guild master.  There is also a level 17 armor quest for 
every town.  That level 17 quest will keep you busy long enough to get 
level 20 if you do all of them.  As you can tell, I've been having fun 
in EQOA.
