Lol...sort of crossing with a different thread, I sold the elizabethan 
to a friend for plat in game. So, what is the difference if the tailored 
item was in game or in RL=) [other than in game my tailoring is at about 
133, I'll let you decide what my RL tailoring skill level is=_]

My main problem is I have an exceedingly *good* emotional self image, 
despite my crappy body. I would like to still have my 5'7" 135 size 8 
body still, but the broken back, endocrine system problems and 
associated health problems sort of rendered that impossible. I am *very* 
body conscious, and not pleased with it as it stands [ok, right now it 
sits most all the time=)] but I have a good man who loves me and has 
been with me for the entire roughly 15 year slide in health. Instead of 
doing the fat lady thing, I try to dress neatly and keep scrupulously 
clean - nothing as annoying as a fat sweaty broad...

on the plus side, the corsetry that goes under an elizabethan is very 
comfortable and is absolutely killer back support=) If i have a really 
bad back day, and I have to be out and around, i will put the corset on 
instead of a regular back brace and nobody can tell i am wearing it=)
