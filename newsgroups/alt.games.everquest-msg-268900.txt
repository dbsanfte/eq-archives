Most quests with equipment rewards let you choose among a set of
rewards, at least one of which is good for a cleric (they may not give
more wisdom, but they'll probably give at least more AC/power/hp, all
of which are usable for any class).  Not to mention that spoiler sites
tend to spoil the fun in discovering and doing quests, but of course
YMMV.
