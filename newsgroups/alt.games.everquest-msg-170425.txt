	There is nothing to hack that has not already been hacked.

	In the battle between developers and abusers, the abusers will always win,
provided there is anything to abuse.  The moral here is to make sure that
every single scrap of information sent to the client is displayed to the user
(if the user chooses to enable that display), because eventually, it will be.
If it's something you don't want the user to see, don't send it in the first
place, no matter how much easier it makes your life on the server end.
