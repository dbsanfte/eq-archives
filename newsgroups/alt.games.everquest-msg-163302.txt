So don't sell the account.  But feel free to let the buyer know your
account info for free.

Against the EULA?  You'll never be "agreeing" to that again anyway, so it's
hardly binding on you.  That's playing devil's advocate, though, as I think
the EULA is about as binding as a bowl of prunes.  I know *I've* never read
it, and I've played this game since the beginning.
