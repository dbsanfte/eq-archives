l tend to give more stuff to players of similar class/race, and in
particular lower levels regardless of whether they are alts or mains.
If there were two people wanting the same item however, l would chat for a
while and see who would need it more.
I think the younger the player the more likely they are to choose the same
as RL gender, the older players go for the swaps.
Also, l have been in groups where it was obvious l was in with twelve year
olds from the way they carried on about things (well l hope they were
anyway!), so l would tend to give the item to the more mature player.
