There are a few good Wizard quest items, doable at moderate level:

1. Staff of the Wheel.  If you avoid reading the spoilers for the locations
of the 10 parts, this is also one of the most enjoyable quests in the game.

2. Staff of Temperate Flux.

3. Acumen Mask.  Good +INT item, with a useful right-click effect (one of
the vision magnification spells.  Many people think they are worthless,
because they don't move your clipping plane out any farther.  However, the
limit on how far mobs are visible is actually quite a bit less than the max
clipping plane, and the spell *does* increase the distance at which you can
see mobs).
