So, hot zones have been around for a few months, but I've still not seen 
any real definitive answers about how they work.

I mean, the idea is simple enough, the ZEM of the zone is boosted.

Which lets out a lot of the confusion people seem to suffer, thinking 
that somehow the zone is only good if you are in a very specific level 
range.

If the zone was ok for you before at a given level, while its HOT its a 
better zone, exp wise, thats all.

But how much better?  Haven't seen any specifics.

Further, in the latest patch, the level ranges posted seem... not just 
suggesting something that isn't really true, that the zone will ONLY be 
great in that level range, but rather just plain Wrong about the level 
ranges on at least some of the zones.

For example, they list GE at 50-55 and Chardok at 55-60.  I'd say if 
there's any logical progression it would be Chardok before GE, whether 
that means you go to chardok at 45 and GE at 50, or chardock at 55 and 
GE at 60, or anywhere in between, my point is if you aren't ready for 
chardok you Sure aren't ready for GE, and if GE is getting to be too 
easy for you, then moving to Chardok is going to put you to sleep.

I don't know enough about the other zones on the list to say for sure, 
for example is revamped COM really easier than revamped Nurga?  Or 
Kaesora; is that harder than revamped Dalnir?  While I've played a bit 
in all of the above, I wasn't comparing them, or even necessarily doing 
them on the same character.  Hmm, Have I been to Dalnir since revamp? 
Was it even revamped at all?

I currently have a little ranger alt I'm leveling up a bit to serve as 
tracker for some epic parts for myself and some friends, and perhaps to 
do some raid mob tracking as well.  Since he's not a "real" character, 
I'm generally concentrating on best exp leveling.  Does that mean I 
should take him to Runnyeye which is now HOT, or stay in Paladul, which 
doesn't need a boost to its ZEM to be high speed leveling?
