the general suggestion is to start with 5000 bone chips.  As an ogre
you can get high enough to do the quest without projection Illusion;
others like Barb and Vah Shir shaman need it in order to overcome the
max faction raise limit (you can only raise your faction to indif I
think until you get the "your faction cannot get any better" message).
