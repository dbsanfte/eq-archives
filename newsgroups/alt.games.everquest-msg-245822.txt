It was a war between the gnomes of Ak'Anon and Meldrath the Malignant.
It starts at Meldrath's cave, but spreads as people train mobs off.  I
don't know if anything happens beyond the mobs fighting, I was too
tired after a few hours of watching the carnage and went to bed.  I've
heard that some pretty nice loots dropped, but I'm not sure what
dropped them.
