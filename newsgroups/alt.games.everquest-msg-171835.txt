There's nothing MTV or gen X about these nicknames.  Generating nicknames is
common to humans throughout history, and there's no reason I can imagine
that it shouldn't take place in fantasy worlds.  Medieval literature is full
of them.  Maybe you've got an overly strict view of the fantasy genre.
Maybe you imagine fantasy characters to be unimaginative?
