I don't have agp either.  For another $50 you could have gone with a 64 meg
geforce2.  I have an hp xt858.  Really the only bad things are the sucky
video card and the lack of open slots.  Since it already had everything I
wanted (dvd, cd-rw. floppy, etc) and was outrageously cheap I decided to go
for it.  I had been planning on upgrading the video anyway since kunark was
choppy at best.  I am very happy with the system right now.  Kunark screams.

I won't go to luclin for a while.  I still have velious to check out and
there are a lot of places on antonica and kunark that I haven't been.
