You gave the "overwrites SOW" point in response to a discussion over
whether snare/ensnare are better than the darkness line.  Your comment
was pointless.

It has it's advantage, but most people agree that in daily use, they
would prefer a snare/ensnare spell in their lineup over a darkness
spell for all the reasons given.

I don't think anyone disagrees that in certain situations it is a neet
feature.  What they do disagree with you on is whether or not one
spell line is generally superior to the other.  Most people, in my
experience, believe snare/ensnare are superior.

You weren't.  Suddenly you started comparing darkness spells to no
movement decrease spell at all.

Look around at all the other people telling you that you are wrong,
bullheaded, purposefully missing the point, etc, and think about that.
 Think about the kind of responses you generated in the "Rangers Suck"
thread.  Do you really think it is a flaw in everyone else that makes
them respond to you they way they do?

Do you even know what a strawman is?  The fact that the darkness line
will break mezz is one of the *KEY* reasons that people would prefer
to be able to cast a snare spell over a darkness spell.  *That* is the
point of discussion.  WHich spell would *you* prefer and why?  If you
are arguing any other point, you are off topic, not everyone else.

The en/snare vs darkness discussion started because someone was asking
for a advice on which character to start.  The fact that this person
is a newbie does not mean that the discussion of relative character
strengths and weaknesses is limited to the first 20 or 30 levels.  He
wanted to know which character would be better for him, that's all. 
Not which character is the best for the first few weeks of play time.

Snare is a level 1 druid spell.

> Clinging darkness is a LEVEL 4 NECRO SPELL!
> The title of the thread "Total Newbie to EQ"

The subject of the thread is "which character should I play"?  Not
"which character should I play for 20 levels then quit"?

Actually it's level 1 and at level 1 it lasts 6 seconds.  However its
duration is level based and by level 15 I believe it is, this 15 mana
spell will last its maximum of 4 minutes.

You accuse him of comparing apples to oranges, then you do the same
thing.  Heck by the time a druid is level 4, his snare will probably
already outlast cascading darkness.

If you stop making up bullshit like this, you will have less to get
upset about.

By the way, since you want to limit this to a "newbie" discussion
(your prerogative since no one but you ever did) what level 4
character will be grouping anyway?  In fact can you even find a necro
who has ever had to cast cascading darkness in a group situation to
prevent a mob from running?  By the time they want to group, the facts
everyone here has cited about the spell lines are all true.

Even for total newbies, by the time they are grouping to get
experience:
-Snare will already be outlasting any darkness spell in the game
-Snare will take less mana than any darkness spell in teh game
-Snare will not break mez
-Snare will sometimes be less resistable (so some have said, I really
don't know)

Now regarding the duration issue.  The point you have to make is *not*
that people will never need 14 minutes to kill something.  No, the
point you have to make is that they will *not* need more than 1.5
minutes (longest lasting darkness spell I know of--correct me if I'm
wrong) to kill something on a regular basis.

-Fact is, a soloer will almost always need more than 1 or 1.5 minutes
to kill something, at least when killing the typical white, yellow, or
red.
-Fact is, groups often take this long to kill something.
-Fact is, casting darkness at the beginning of a fight in groups is
often a bad idea anyway, so the dot component is at least partially
wasted.
-Fact is, as a Ranger, I use, and have used snare my whole career to
keep bad pulls under control.  If you root a mob, snare it either
before or after the root.  It gives you time to re-root.  I don't have
to explain what happens to CC when the chanter joins the group.  Snare
*everything*.  The good news is that if you can snare or ensnare it
rather than putting darkness on it, you can kill multiple mobs and the
last one you kill will likely *still* be snared.

Darkness has one advantage, and that is essentially that it saves you
a spell slot *if* you would othewise be casting a non-DOT snare and
casting a somewhat weak dot on your mob.

Let's put this in perspective.  Imagine that Shaman and Druids got a
nifty spell that would complete heal, just like a cleric, but that
would also cast cure disease and cure poison at the same time.  This
theoretical spell would cost 2 to 4 times as much as the Cleric
complete heal.  These clases gets no other PC complete heal spell
(just theoretical, mind you).  Do you think most Druids and Shaman
would prefer this complete heal spell over the Cleric complete heal
because in some (rare) cases, it is more advantageous?
