In this instance, though, I submit that this is a "reflexive" word; I 
need the points, you are greedy for the points, and he is being an ass 
for grubbing for the points.

In this instance, that doesn't apply.  I'm talking about the "picking 
which LDoN location to go for.  Same note for your other points below.

Yes, he is, if he thinks he deserves it over someone else who put in the 
same effort but happens to have better gear.  Is it a bad thing?  No, 
and most people will be sympathetic about it, too.  But wanting things 
to improve yourself is wanting things to improve yourself.

Still, this doesn't have anything to do with the LDoN mission points deal.

Heh, that will show me for not running a spell checker when I think I've 
got it right!

However, I think it is the word I was looking for.  Lets see.

A division or the process of dividing into two esp. mutually exclusive 
or contradictory groups. (Merriam Webster Dictionary)

Need, Greed.  A dichotomy when its a question of use versus sale, but 
synonymous when its a question of "needing" the item to sell to upgrade 
yourself versus just "wanting" it for that purpose.  Thus, for LDoN 
mission choices, I propose that Need and Greed are not a dichotomy.
