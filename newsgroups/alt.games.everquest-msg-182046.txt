It's that caution that nearly ruined the game for me.  When I first started
my paladin out, my first instinct was to explore the world around me, to see
what there is to see (maybe it was the title "Everquest" that put that silly
notion into me).  By now, I stick with zones I know, and rarely explore.
It's not that I wouldn't like to explore, it's just that I don't feel like
trying to go pull my corpse out of a hole somewhere that I couldn't survive
with full gear.  It took a while for SOE's pavlov treatment to work, but now
I shun risk, just like every other good lemming, er.... player.

One of the things I like about my bard is that she can go where my paladin
can't.  This means I may actually be able to explore.

To quote Krim, from .hack//sign: " 'The World' is a game, entertainment.
Play it how you are best able to enjoy it."  Ahhh, such wisdom from such a
cool character.  I want to be like Krim when I grow up.

The lowest common denominator you're referring to are the casual players who
do not have the time, nor the inclination to memorize every square inch of
Norrath.  Personally, I tend to think that many of them are a tad more
well-adjusted than some of the rest of us.  I'd rather not see them banished
because of their lack of slavish devotion to the game.
