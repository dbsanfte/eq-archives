Yes, it does help. Thank you. I didn't know I could look them up @
Google. After entering "emoticon", I got about 27,800 results. I didn't
go through all 27,800 of them, but of those that actually dealt with
emoticons in the first ten results, they confirm that neither of those
"implies humor" as you so wrongfully put it. I DID see the smiley face
used, so I knew the other two were put there for a reason other than
humor. That "reason" was what I wanted to know.

"What, you didn't know? It's only important if it [Terrorism] happens in
the US" is pretty much straightforward and self-explanatory.
