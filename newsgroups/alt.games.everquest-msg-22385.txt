I've been trying to find some information on the max skill points for each
of the levels for each class.

You know when you get the message that your skill in 1 hand blunt has
increased to 53.
I found a site that gives the information for a bard but I would like it for
all the classes.
Does any one know were to find it or what the formula is.
It seems that each level is a least 5 points.
Thanks
Shirley
