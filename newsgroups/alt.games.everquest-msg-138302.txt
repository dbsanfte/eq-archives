Sorry if you tried last night...my alt went LD in Kael's arena, and
then I couldn't log back in with either her OR the corpse mule there...
repatching the zone didn't work until today.  I don't think Ryou would
come back complaining about me being bored, though...

So I'll try and shoot you a /tell when I log on tonight...once I can
figure out how to get out of the arena (put on the resist gear
and hope run III is enough...)

The disclaimer is the same one that's been up since about 6 months
after the rogue epic was added to the game.  See, Renux always drops
the JDD, and the General always drops the pouch.  The General ALSO
used to ALWAYS drop the Quill, too....which really shortened the rogue
epic a lot more than it used to be (my main got his epic during this time).
Now, your friend can expect to spend a lot of time in Kithicor trying to
round
up folks to single pull-and-kill Q'ioul when she spawns 90% of the time in
an Ishva robe, and having a heart attack the one time it's 3am CST and
she pops in a green robe...not to mention learning to speak japaneese
while going on every single Kedge raid out there...
;-)
