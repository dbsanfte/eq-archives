Excuse, let me modify the scenario then.  A month before this riot, a gang
of people were tearing up my neighbor's houses and mugging them
periodically.  I preferred not to directly involve myself, since after all
it wasn't my fight, but I gave them tear gas and guns to protect themselves
from these threats.  I tell them that while I'm not going to directly
involve myself, I'll be willing to give them a hand anytime in making
themselves more capable of defending themselves.  I made these promises not
expecting them to do what they later did.  Foolish promises perhaps, but no
worse than that.

On the day of the riot, these people have driven off the gang that was
assaulting them when suddenly they realize that they have guns they aren't
using... so they decide to use them to rob random passersby, starting a riot
by which my girlfriend, boss, business associates, and friends are put into
danger... the rest of the story you already know.

So, now, in light of my correction which you so kindly pointed out I needed
to make, what would you respond to the people who bash you for your actions?
