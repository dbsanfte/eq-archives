<copied from april 28 patch notes>
You can visit the Lost Pyramid of Galuuk Korr.  This midlevel adventure zone
will allow you to explore a monument from the lost elvish city of Takish
Hiz! Now you must find what was left beneath the sands.

I have asked on several boards and cannot find anyone that can say they
actually have been to this zone.  A few responded that it is a midlevel ldon
tak layout, but when I ask if they have actually personally seen it they
never confirm.  I know for a fact that there are still midlevel players
because I hear them every day ooc'ing for ldon groups.  The message to me
reads like it is NOT a ldon.  Granted, it says it is a city of Takish Hiz,
but it also says you can explore it and by my experience people do not go to
ldon's to explore.  Anyone been there?  If so what level were you?  It's
been a month now so if it exists then someone must have been there.
