I've heard varying reports on it's value. I'm not sure it's worth 8K any
more - unless of course you find someone who will pay you that. :-)

I think my goal will be to get at least 5250pp for it (or as close as
possible).  That way I can get a tinkerer's bag.. 10 slots, 100% weight
reduction.. I'll actually be able to LOOT with this character (my main)! So,
I guess I'll be spending time in EC and Sol A this weekend. Maybe my luck
will hold out and I can just trade the club for a tink bag straight up?
Nah.. I know I'm not THAT lucky! :-)
