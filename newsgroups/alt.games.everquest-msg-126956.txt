If you do 49% damage to a mob, and he does 51%, then he gets 100% of the exp
If you do 51% damage and he does the rest, you get the kill.. and assuming
its a green to you mob, noone gets any exp at all.

A normal tactic is to let the PLer damage a mob to 50% on his own, then finish
it off quick for him.  This is dangerous though, since the final blow counts
for full value even if it goes well past killing the mob.  Say a mob has 100hp,
your buddy does 51 damage, then you take over, hit for 26  26... hmm,
you did 52 points to his 51, even though he did more than 50% of the mob's HP.

A plan that works a little more reliably is for you to "soften up" the mob
beforehand
and let him finish the job, now if there is any damage past the "dead" mark its
coming from him.

Any spell effects that you do other than damage won't influence the exp
equation,
-only- damage counts.  Likewise, you can heal your buddy to your hearts content
and never worry about the count.

One strange thing, Damage Shield damage doesn't count for anyones' total, it
merely reduces the HP total of the mob.  This -can- make it difficult to judge
where the "he did more than me" point lies.

One plan would be to pick animal mobs, snare them, fear them, and let
him do all the damage.  Another would be to DS yourself, then aggro
all the mobs you can find and let them chew away at you, your buddy
can pick off the almost dead ones as they walk away.  You might have
to take off most of your armor just so you can get hit... or I find sitting
works pretty well.

Once your friend hits level... 7 I think it is... he can group with you.
If you still want to concentrate on PLing him, you can kill mobs that
are green to you and blue to him, and he will get all the exp.  This is
a lot easier than real PLing, since you can take the kid gloves off.
Or you can kill mobs that are yellow or red to you, both get exp,
and he'll level faster than you and catch up

Similarly, when he hits 9th level he can group with -you-... and then
when you get him to 25 he can group with your ranger.
