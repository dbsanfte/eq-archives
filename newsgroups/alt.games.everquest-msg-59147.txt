Here here. Well said Dennis.

For me its not even all PvP players its just that a one or a few assholes can
screw up a good game for ALL the rest of the other players. Which is just
plain wrong. I don't mind playing PvP games, hell I love to play quake UT and
Counterstrike, but only with people I know and trust as courteous and non-cheaters.
I have played great games on the net that have been totally screwed up by 'one'
person coming in and screwing around.

Massive on line games can allow for massive asshole to screw up my game. No thanks.
