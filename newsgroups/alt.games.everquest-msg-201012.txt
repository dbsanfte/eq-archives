Now that's just silly. This isn't a job. There doesn't need to be a "put up
with the hardships in order to succeed" mentality. It's a game. People play
games to have fun. This particular game asks us to pay good money to play
and have fun. I don't know about anyone else, but sitting on my butt waiting
for the game to catch up to me is not fun, nor do I feel like it's something
I need to pay for.

If we applied your "stick with it" definition to other forms of
entertainment, a movie would stop every ten minutes, then start playing
again fifteen minutes later. Those willing to "stick with it" would be
rewarded by getting to see the whole movie. The argument that downtime makes
the rewards of the game more rewarding makes no sense.
