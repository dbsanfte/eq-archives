    I'll try to remember it too.  I have to admit I don't really care that much,
but it is polite to use the correct pronoun.

    Was the character you were playing at the time also a female?  If so, I
wonder if this was a case of "why the hell am I taking orders from a chick?"
syndrome.  I have to say I've encountered sexist attitudes a few times in
Norrath.  But, the direct confrontation approach Biz favors works quite well
regardless of rather you're an inny or an outie.
