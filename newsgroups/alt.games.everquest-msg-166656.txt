If he's keeping the entire area he is claiming completely (or almost
completely) dead on each spawn cycle...  then IMO, it's his until he leaves.
If he's claiming a camp that is too big, I have no problem pulling the
extras that he's not getting killed.    You can claim whatever you want, but
if it's there, respawns happen, it's still there, and you never quite get to
pull it...  let someone else who can get it dead have thier shot.

A guy sitting in Seb calling "Chef / Bar" when their group is sitting in
chef and only pulling 1/10 of the bar mobs...  No issues at all with
snagging 80 percent of what he leaves to add to my camp.

If they have enough efficiency to keep every Geonid spot cleared each time,
then why wouldn't they?

If you're asking why Geonids only... probably the same reasons you want to
kill them instead of going somewhere else.
