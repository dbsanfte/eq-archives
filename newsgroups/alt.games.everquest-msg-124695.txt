   Correction.  You can play up to 8 characters on most servers, and you can play on
as many servers as you like (one is a Premium server, and costs more to play.  Don't
bother with that one, yet, if at all).  There are what...fourty-ish servers
available?  So if you're really the compulsive type, you can play up to around 320
characters, give or take a score.
