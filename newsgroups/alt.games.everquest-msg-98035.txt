Yes, we all love clerics with 24 Defense and 9 Dodge...

[Rest snipped]

I like the new changes, providing they don't go overboard and add
even more stupefaction of the game. But I'm a bit leery of this
change, as moving too fast through early levels means having to
catch up on skills when mobs are much harder, and also learning
stuff when you are further from home and the mobs are harder.

Still, I'm not the least bit sorry to see the spellbook go, and
I don't really care one way or the other about the hell levels.
I hope those two changes make it soon anyway, not everyone has
49+ cleric friends to rezz back the splat level death losses.
Although with the new improved rezz lines, those levels won't
hurt as much anymore, either.

Rune Little, buck buck...
