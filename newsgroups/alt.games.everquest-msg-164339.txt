 How about getting out of Nightmare and into a zone that drops 63-64
spells? Nah, too much like work.

 LOL. That was an obvious exploit. If you can't get 6 people through the
trials you probably don't belong in PoV/PoS. You shouldn't be able to
gimp your way through PoP.

 I don't see this happening. In fact, they raised the XP in PoS. If they
thought the amount of XP gained in PoP was too fast they wouldn't have
done that. The XP in PoS is nearly twice as much as you get in PoV.
