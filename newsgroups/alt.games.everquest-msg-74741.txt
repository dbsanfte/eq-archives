yea, I think I would not right down certain passwords, or forget some stupid
password at one point or another.

Then you get to the point where people are copying them down and giving them
to people who shouldn't get them.  still happens on console games today.

Not that I remember playing '80 console games with these stupid passwords,
but definitely remember them being around for current games.

Then again I remember people copying passwords for things like access to
various games, like empire deluxe on www.theunderdogs.com

As to Twinks - I think I've played enough EQ to be able to twink even if I
wasn't twinked.  ROFL  you go up considerably faster and easier when you
know what your doing.  You die less often, you know where your body is
exactly if you died because you bothered to /loc'ed your death, or know
where it is exactly, etc.   You don't bother exploring at low level because
you have already seen everything you wanna see until you level up.

I don't twink chars past the first few levels, I usually twink continually
if the char deserves it based on performance/relationship with my main.
Like when my alts / twinks start handing out stuff they got as gifts to
other newbs because they feel too twinked.  really pisses off the main,
giving away gifts he gave them solely.  Thus they eventually aren't as
twinked as everyone else, and the alt's desire is reached.

I think that anyone who questions the ethics of twinks should only do so for
one reason.  Would Verant make the critters harder because all PC's are
stronger than monsters, thus ruining the balance.  With the influx of
newbies, I don't think or feel this is the case.

If your going to site it for OOC reasons, I don't think or feel you really
know how to roleplay.
