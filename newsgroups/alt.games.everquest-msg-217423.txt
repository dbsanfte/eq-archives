Nope, all the high level megabuffs are now actually level limited
so that they don't stick to people under the minimum regardless
of whether they are the target or not (this was the old
workaround, group buffs targetted on someone who was of
sufficient level would stick to others in the group even though
they were toooooooo low)

Temperance, a 44 cleric HP/AC buff spell, is now the only massive
duration buff I can think of offhand for low levels.
