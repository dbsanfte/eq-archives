My partner and I are new to grouping.... and I got the dubious honor of pulling
and being in charge.  
1.  Is it normal for someone to camp the WHOLE lake area?  (this was NOT us).
2. This guy joined our duo and then immediately grabbed 2 NICE loots.  Isn't
this VERY VERY RUDE before even asking about looting order?  Should we have
disbanded him IMMEDIATELY?  (He asked to join us....)
3.  After the 3rd kill we stopped to med and he immediately gated back to GF to
sell.  Didn't even say he was going.  He wasn't back when we were ready to pull
again.  I disbanded him and he got all mad.  Was I wrong or was he a bovine
A-hole?
4. Another guy joined us so we were still a trio - necro, wizard and me,
ranger.  *I* was getting my butt kicked at one point so I yelled ZONE.  Is it
wrong for the leader to zone while other members are still fighting?  I ended
up dead and they ended up zoning.  Later our new friend said I should have
zoned sooner.  I feel like I am "abandoning ship" when I do that...  On the
other hand they had to wait while I ran all the way back from GF and that sucks
too...
