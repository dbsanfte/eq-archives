Mend has a skill cap formula of (level times 5) + 5, therefore at sixth
level your mend cap is 35.  Keep working on it.

Mend becomes highly useful around 80.  Around 50 you can attempt it.

Mend is one of the best heels because it returns hit points based on current
hit points not skill.  It gives you 30% of your current hit points
(including buffs) or penalizes you 30% if you have a critical failure.

Mend can be used during battle, sitting or standing, and even on the run.
It also has no casting time, therefore is better than most heals in the
game.

  Monks do run faster than other classes, primarily because of increased
agility.  If you took a warrior and pumped up his agility, he'd run faster
too.

As far as disposing of SoW,...... never!  It will simply make you go faster,
regardless of what speed you can run without it.  As you level, you'll need
to run much greater distances than the length of East Commons (a relatively
small zone).  Since monks still can't bind in most zones, corpse runs still
require spirit of Wolf quite often.
