You know, the more I play, the more I love my
mage, now level 54.  Got my last 1.5 blue 
in a CoM raid.

Today - CoM raid to try and get Jade Reavers
(We have a great many Rangers and Druids in
our guild).  Once again, our luck in this area
was atrocious, this makes 4 or more of these
raids without a singe Jade Reaver drop.

I'm the highest of 3 post 50 mages in the guild,
and only one other is played often.  Imagine
my delight when one of my guildies says over
the raid channel - "Woot, Mair's in our group,
we'll be the XP group for sure!"  

The funny thing is that, despite having the
3 lowest level people in the raid in it, (2
45 monks and a 42 warrior, plus me and a druid)
he was right.  We were getting the majority
of the xp on non-reaver mobs, char was never even
partially resisted, despite the fact that I 
didn't bother to Malosi.  

We had some chaotic multi pulls, but most people
listened to the raid leader, kept their heads, and
we came through them with few casualties (mostly
in the low levels in my group).  More fun, I can't
imagine :)

Later, after some folks had left and groups were
reassigned, I was in the MA group with the 54 pally,
54 monk, cleric, 'chanter and druid.  We were STILL
getting the majority of the xp, and I was suddenly
able to use Boon of Immolation to awesome effect.  I
should go look in my logs and figure out just how
much damage it was doing, but the stream of XXXX was
burned scrolled right off my chat window.

The piece de resistance for me, of course, was Rak Ashiir.
He was up when we got there.  So, before going upstairs,
we took him down.  My lowly 40th level firepet, with
2 clerics a druid a 'chanter and me keeping him alive.  We
discovered that was overkill.  Sure enough, He drops a
Ornate Rune Blade - which my RL buddy won on the roll.  Right
after that, the next reaver spawned him again.  We left him
alone until the end - took him again.  This time it was just
2 clerics, the chanter and me keeping him (level 41 this time)
alive while the rest of the raid handled the constant stream of 
pops. Down he goes, and yet another ORB.  Is that a common drop 
for him?  At any rate, the pally who had given me the words of
bondage necessary to research my 49 fire pet so long ago
was the one who won that roll.  Karma, I suppose :)

At the end of the raid, everyone gave a cheer for my buddy
Spike.  I'm used to my regular groupmates liking for my
pets, but to see a whole raid, with folks from an allied
guild who don't group with me much being impressed by my
pet was just awesome.

I'm going to have to take 55+ mages word for the fact that
things change in the upper 50's, but up to 54, in my daily
play, there ain't nothing wrong with mages.  At least in
my guild, there's not even a perception that mages are 
underpowered.

Also, the one time one of our 'chanters had to say something
about folks not leaving the mezzed adds alone, it wasn't
Spike on them :)  (F1 F1 /assist - Black Reaver - Yep, he's
on the right one)

All in all a blast of a day, and the kind of experience that
helps offset the feelings generated by the intense negativity
on the Magicians Tower.
