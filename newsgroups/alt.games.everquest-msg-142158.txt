The fact that it's possible to break the law without too much trouble does
not negate the fact that it is the law.

Odd, it seems to have worked on a large scale, as well.... whereas
socialism, communism, and fascism have pretty much universally failed.

With the ability to move freely between castes.  In other words, it created
a meritocracy.  I can think of worst things.  Also, your use of the word
"caste" shows a bit of a bias.  It's a charged word, most often used with a
wink and nod to the pariah caste.  And, yes, you have the fantastically
rich, so?  Why is that a bad thing?  You forget that we also have a very
large middle class.

Which was ruled to be illegal.

If you're getting your information from that book, then it's clear where
your distortions lie.  Sinclair Lewis had a definate axe to grind with
middle-class America.  Also, recall that The Jungle is FICTION.

And sets in motion checks and balances that can only be removed by
ignorance... which is why they're falling by the wayside in modern society.

Perfect people would neither require, nor desire a government.  Lazzie-faire
capitalism would be the ideal form of government, even then.

But still far better than socialism (though I wouldn't want a completely
unregulated world, either... there's enough blatant stupidity and poor
judgement going around to cause some serious harm if there are no
watchdogs.)
