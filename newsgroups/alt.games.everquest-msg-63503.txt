Hey, I just tried to log in at exactly 2:00pm CST (that's  noon
PST) and couldn't log in! Is it just me? Does anybody know
why?  Dammit, I skipped work to play today!  Everybody
should get a lawyer and bring a class action lawsuit against
Verant for all of the time that we're missing while they're
having trouble with their stupid servers!  And I should find
an accountant who can tell me exactly how much of my $9.89
is being wasted RIGHT NOW WHILE I CAN'T GET ON!












<tongue in cheek mode>  Just figured I'd post it to head off
the 32,841 "why cant i log in" messages from folks too stupid
to realize what both (a)today, and (b)  tomorrow are.  I know
why the servers are down, how long they'll be down, and when
they're supposed to come back up and why.  I add this <t-i-c>
to the bottom because I've ALSO played EQ long enough to
know that somebody will just read the first 3 lines of the above
post and write "get a life, loser...it's patch day" without ever
realizing this is a crummy attempt at humor.

Thank  you and good day...see you all on the moon!
;-)
