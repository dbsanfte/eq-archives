One more thing, there was a large scale event planned and it was stopped on
the US/Canadian border. I didn't take the millenium serious either. But a
van full of explosives were stopped and it was linked to Bin Laden. Will
more events occur? Odds are yes. Do I want them to? No. Do I hope to sound
like a fool 10 years from now? Yes. Do I think I will sound like a fool 10
years from now? No. The rules have changed, we are all on the front lines in
one way or another. The odds are in your favor, but you don't want to be on
the losing side of an event is my message.
