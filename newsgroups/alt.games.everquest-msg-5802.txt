So good of you to take up the challenge then.  I see my original observation
of you being stuck on "stupid" rings true even here.

<banter snipped>

Here's one of my own:

Name:  BratWurst
Class:  Rectal Sausage
Level:  Varies depending on waterline.

Int:  0
Wis: 0
Str:  100
Sta:  10
Agi:  0
Dex:  0

This floating character can be found in most outbuildings in the realm.  Its
strength comes from the odor it emits when young.  It ages quickly, and will
take on a dry appearance as time passes.  It will communicate, but only on
the most rudimentary level.  Typically, it will attempt to befriend other
classes by besmirching another, but its motives are often discovered and it
is punished by being placed in a paper sack and set ablaze.

Beware.  This character is known to carry diseases, but is easily vanquished
using the level 2 spell, "Flush".  The Cleric item, "Lysol" will cause this
character great pain and discomfort.  The mere mention of the level 1 spell,
"Bath" will cause it to convulse and die, theoretically through fear of the
spell being cast upon it.
