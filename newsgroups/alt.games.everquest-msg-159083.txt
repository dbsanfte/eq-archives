Agree.

The only alternative to this is MoK - Mark of Karn - which is a reverse DS
cast on mobs.. strips the mobs DS, and then every time somebody hits the
mob, *they* are healed a few points (its crappy, like 3 a hit for 1h)

Damage shields go into the "nobodies damage" category, so it doesnt count as
your damage done.  Thats why PLing with DS is sooo effective
