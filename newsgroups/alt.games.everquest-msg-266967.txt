Unfortunately, I don't recall all the quests I did off hand that resulted 
in bags, so can't point you to most of them.  One was from a guy named 
Veth (or something like that) behind the buildings in the zone with the 
erudites in Qeynos.  If you do that one, do not take the delivery back to 
him, instead, take it to the guard listed in the quest, and you get a 
nice bag.
