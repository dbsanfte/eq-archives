True.  But it also means that I can't distinguish the rich, generous guy 
who just wants the item now from the newbie who didn't know it was at the 
high end of the price scale for that item.

}And the bazaar elimintes this. Yes?

Not really.  Lowers the odds, though.

Actually, I backed up a couple posts and reread yours.  In one part, you 
said something about the greedy merchant 'convincing' the naive buyer that 
his overinflated price was fair and reasonable.  Yes, I'll agree, thats 
much more likely to be a scam...  You didn't carry that particular case 
through the rest of the post, though, so it comes off as slamming anyone 
who doesn't sell at the bargain basement rate to everyone on the off 
chance they might be a newbie.  Which is odd, of course, since as I recall 
in other threads you've spoken up for the practice of setting a higher 
than basement price on the grounds that the cheaper ones will sell and 
then yours will be the only one on the market soon enough, so patience 
will profit for you...
