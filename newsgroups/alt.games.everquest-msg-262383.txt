You gather correctly.  It's introduced in OoW and currently only on OoW
items.  It basically remains "free" for selling or trading but once it is
equpped, it "attunates" to the wearer and becomes no drop permantly.

If you don't have OoW installed, you can still get the item but only from
friends, auctions, and bazaar.
