Hardly.

And most get taken down on patch day. As such.. they are all up 3 days
later, give or take a couple hours. And 3 days after that. Either
way... a raiding guild *ALWAYS* knows what spawns they're waiting on
and usually have a track list with time of last kill, expected spawn
time, and spotters ducking in and out of various areas watching for
when something breaks. And life span as you referred to it.. minutes
meaning like 5-10 just isn't realistic for most raid targets. It
usually takes that long just to get enough on site, another 5-10 to
get coordinated, sometimes another 10-15 to break to the target(i.e.
HP in SSRA) and then you get to kill it.. sometimes taking 20-30
minutes. And then in some cases anywhere from 5-30 more minutes
depending on the system. The most important part really is to just
'show' to the server you are on it. Perception is 99% and if you have
people on site and forming, most other guilds aren't going to try to
jump you to get the spawn, and expect the same in return.

Getting last kill information isn't hard.. and most officers in
raiding guilds track from patch day on. Most mobs as i said can be up
1-2 hours  before being taken down so its not like its any big secret
that it spawned or you are killing and the time you did it. Rarely can
you just get in, kill, and get out before anyone notices/passes the
word. Even then.. usually friends tell friends of their kills,
especially if they got loot from the kill.. its just the nature of
things.
