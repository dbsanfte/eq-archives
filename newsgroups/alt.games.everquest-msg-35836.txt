HA!
Wolfform and SoW stacking was a HUGE exploit a while back.

Seems a while back, someone in share wolfform would lose wolfform when
someone higher leveled (than the caster of the share wolfform) cast
SoW on them.

I'll leave it up to the reader to see the potential mischief one can
create with this in say...Unrest.
