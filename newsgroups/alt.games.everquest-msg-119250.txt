I used cancel a -lot- prior to getting Mark of Karn, pretty much any
Damage Shielded mob -had- to be cancelled down to get rid of it,
other buffs can be a pain but DS means I have to heal every melee
in the group with the little inefficient heals, too wasteful of mana.

Mark of Karn directly removes the DS and replaces it with a heal
shield, so I no longer have to worry about stripping off the crucial
Tash Slow and Snare spells that our team are putting on while I'm
busy stripping that DS....

There are still mobs that are easier with their buffs removed, though,
and the cancel magic line makes an excellent pull; its cheap, low aggro
(meaning that the mob is easily tagged off the puller, and there's a
better chance of single pull) and removing any buffs on there before
the mob is engaged is like slapping some substantial debuffs on.
