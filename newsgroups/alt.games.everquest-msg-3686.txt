I'll attempt to illuminate your problem a little.

Think of it as joining a class to learn something. Commonly accepted
procedure: you show up, take your place, try to find out how to behave
in the classroom, start listening to lectures and asking questions,
make friends with your other classmates.

Your procedure: barge into the classroom slamming the door, announcing
your name in a loud voice and that you own the school some of the
class's greatest troublemakers came from, shouting that you're here to
learn and telling the teachers you won't mess with them if they won't
mess with you, complaining when you can't have your books printed in
Swahili instead of English and want all references removed from every
piece of text since they've already been read any ANYONE should at any
time be aware of them (I assume you never had to write a thesis), try
to enforce your 'correct' mode of communication - pig latin - on the
class, and act very blustering around your classmates, emphasizing
that you're here to learn and won't threaten them unless they threaten
you, all while not asking any useful questions, only aggressively
asking why the class doesn't immediately embrace you, and seem more
absorbed in getting everyone into a defensive stance than in getting
the information you've repeatedly state you want. (How's that for a
long sentence?)

You should have just asked your questions about EQ without all that
crap about this group's accepted posting style, your status in the FA
group (which means nothing here) and your aggressive attitude with the
"I won't mess with you if you don't mess with me" comments. Since you
start as a nothing here, you can't intimidate anyone with an attitude
like that in your first post, you only set yourself up as KF bait.

Now, if you could drop the whining and posturing and actually ask EQ
related stuff instead of continually making the same mistakes your lil
trolls in the subject header made (albeit on a lesser scale than they
did)...

You keep saying you're just here to learn. Prove it.
