The one on sky level spawns Neh, the one in the Throne Room
spawns Ghiosk, and one of the ones up the elevator spawns
Rak.  The others spawn a phantom.

Rak and Neh are non-KoS when they spawn.  Neh is level 55
and procs a slow - magic immune, Rak is 55 and procs a 1500
pt fire/lure dot (3 ticks? 4? real quick).

Used to be you could take Rak with a 49 plus mage with his
fire pet and a cleric with KEI.  After the patches that
let pets take their master's resistances, this can sometimes
not work.

If you go this route, make the mage take off any fire resist
gear he has on - seems if the mage has his resist up decently
the pet uses it instead of it's innate immunity - and no
PC resist is high enough.  

Only think is it's a LONG fight - you really don't want your
melee in there and Rak is magic immune (except lures).  So
you basically let him beat himself to death on the fire-pet's
DS.  The cleric healing the pet can sit without fear of being
summoned.  The biggest part about Rak is picking up adds quickly.
They home in on the mage.

I've done somewhere around 15 or 20 Rak kills before we finally
got all the jade reavers we needed - many of them just me and
a cleric - or me and a couple or 3 druid/shaman (before the
addition of the imcomplete heal for them)

The 3 of them really aren't that tough - we've done Neh with
less than 10 people (all mid 50's or lower).  The biggest
problem we had that time was that we got repops on us :(
