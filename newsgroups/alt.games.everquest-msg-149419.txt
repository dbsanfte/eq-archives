I have been gone from EQ for about 6 months
and decided to check back in.
I notice that many of my equipment items
have new effects, e.g Summoning efficiency II, Spell haste II etc.
Is there a place I can find out a summary of these things?
I have tried allaks and stratics and everlore, but I can't
seem to find a nice list of these new bonuses,
as I am assuming they were all added pretty
quickly I thought somone may have done so.
