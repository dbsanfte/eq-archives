EQ will undoubtedly be here when they return. The notion that SoE are 
trying to kill off EQ is preposterous. Why on earth would they want that? 
It still makes them a sizeable chunk of money each and every month.

just the nature of the beast. The satisfied players often feel less 
compelled to speak out.
