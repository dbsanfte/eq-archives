}On the flip side, how drunk are you every time you play EQ if you
}think the old models aren't uglier? Can you even see the screen?
}
}With the exception of Erudite foreheads, I think the Luclin models
}like pretty damn good overall compared to the old ones. I definitely
}like the ogres and trolls better than the fat, almost comical
}butterballs that they were originally.

My opnions break down model by model:

Erudite:  Old models were goofy looking.  New models are even more goofy 
looking for the males, but the women are sexy now.

Barbarian:  Looked good before, still look good afterward.  Possibly a bit 
improved, but eh.  I do like the new chests on barbie females though.  
Torpedos of DOOOOM! :)

Dwarf:  You guys got hosed.  They looked decent before, now the legs are 
too long for the torsos.

Assling:  Who cares? :)  But generally, guys look worse, women look 
better.

Gnomes:  We got hosed.  Now I have to decide whether to be my happy 
decrepit old self, or switch on surly juvenile delinquent mode so I can 
ride my horse.

Vah Shir:  I like em both.  The replacement old models are slightly 
smaller which makes them easier to target around, but clothes look 
much less cool on them.

Froglok:  Old frogloks kicked ass! New frogloks are okay, I guess.

Ogre:  Old ogres were hella cool.  Now they just look like oversized bald 
guys.  And they don't even scratch their behinds.

Human:  Who cares? :)  But again, guys went from bad to worse, women went 
from gorgeous to still gorgeous but different.

Troll:  There are things I like a lot about both models.

Elves:  Pretty much follow the trend.  Men look just as bad to worse, 
women look just as good to a little better.

Iksar:  I like the new ones a little better.

Half Elves:  Somehow, I never notice half elves.  The old model ones must 
have frozen their buttcheeks off though.

Elementals:  Substantially improved visually, but they're -such- a pain to 
target.  I hate going to BoT and having to choose between riding my horse 
and being able to mezz efficiently.

Skeletons:  I liked the original ones a lot.  The luclin ones are very 
prety but too hard to target.  The LDoN ones are easiest to target, but 
look completely ridiculous to me.

I also really hated that my pretty blue Insidious Robe turned puke green 
with the new models.
