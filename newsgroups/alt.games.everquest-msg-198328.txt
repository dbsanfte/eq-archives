John,

I play a cleric on the Torvonillious server. I spend more time working on
gear than aything else, and this is what I am wearing, minus the
Breastplate. As soon as I get the funds I will snag the BP and be set for my
trip to uber planes loot.

I would start with an Emerald Dragonscale Brestplate. It is AC 22 Cha +10
Wis +20 Sv Dis +10 Sv Mag +10 and it usually sells for 7k. You cant get past
the 20 wis on such an great item. Next I would grab an Acrylia Studded Cloak
Ac 7 back slot item with 10 wis and other stats.

Secondary: A crystal chitin shield usually sells for 1.5k and is a great
shield AC 20 +9 wis and +40 mana.

Primary: A Paw of Opalla AC 9 and +9 to wis and agi it is a great item as
well. I would recommend buying the Paw in the bazzar and not doing the
quest. The quest is long and sucks, and you can buy it for roughly 1k or
less in the bazzar.

Range: Depending on Diety, I would get a Wis idol, Like the Golden Idol of
Tunare AC: 4 Wis +5 Mana +4 with a bit of saves.

Feet: Golden Efreeti Boots are a must... +9 wis +9 int ac 5 with a cool
focus effect and a neat looking model, easily the best 5-6k you will spend.

Hands: Gauntlets of the Black are nice AC 15 +4 str +3 wis.

Waist: Chitinous Belt AC 13 Str, Sta, Wis all +5 Sv Dis +10

Legs: Gatorscale Leggins AC 7 wis +4 HP +15 those are nice untill you get
into high end stuff, and find a good no drop replacement.

Fingers: Velium Jasper Rings +7 wis. 14 wis in fingers is really nice.

Face: Acrylia Studded Mask is always nice, AC 5 +5 cha, and +5 wis. It is an
inexpensive item too.

Bracers: When you get up to around 40 go into Karnor's Castle and get a
Jarsath Scale Wrist Guard AC 8 +4 wis +4 cha it is no drop and a cool item.
You should get great xp for camping in there at 40 too.
    If you can find a Bracer of the Forlorn for cheap I would pick one up.
AC 6 wis +3 mana +5

Head: Provided they are for sale, get a Crystal Chitin Circlet AC 12 +3 to
str, wis, and int. It is an awesome item. Or an Othimur Fur cap Ac 6 Wis +6

That is a base set of gear that Will get you through to around lvl 60 if you
need, although I am sure that who ever you play with at that lvl will not
allow you to keep too much of that gear. It all adds 144 to ac and 121 to
wis. It also provides an extra 110 to the mana pool.

Good luck.
