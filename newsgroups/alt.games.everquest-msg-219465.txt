Shaman also suffer from a desperate need for attention, though; a
shaman who isn't chain casting canni mixed with the occaisional
heal at lower levels, or Stoicism/Torpor at levels where thats
appropriate is losing his largest advantage, massive mana regen. 
His heals tend to be less efficient than those of druids or
clerics, but he can overcome that in the long run with his
superior mana flow... if you keep on it.

Shaman are second only to bards in the degree to which you must
remain active at all times in order to get the most out of your
class.
