My post was "why does SOE do it this way?" not "why doesn't SOE
do things the way I think they should?"

Your inability to see the difference is dissapointing.

You act like an ass and you're surprised when someone responds
in kind?

Yes, of course, you're right.  Ignoring your immature behavior
is probably the best way to encourage you to stop exhibiting
immature behavior.

My original post was a question about implementation, not an
accusation that it was wrongly implemented.

: Your "why...?" posts read as whiny
: attempts to gain sympathy for your complaints.

Except there was no complaint.  And having never played a bard
(and having no interest in playing one), I'm not sure how you'd
interpret that as a whine.

However, accusing people of whining seems to be your favorite
usenet activity, one which I'm sure you'll continue.

: I put up with

: not to whine like a spoiled teenager is being an ass, then I guess
: I'll just have to go on being an ass.

I'll go on asking legitimate questions and getting informative
responses (from people like Sean).  If you interpret "Why did SOE
implement this feature this way?" as a whine, then the only
problem is your reading comprehension.

Grow up, Kaev.
