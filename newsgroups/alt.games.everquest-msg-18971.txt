It wouldn't HURT to try and petition. I know of someone who had a name that
they were just not very happy with, and a GM did change it for them. This
may only work at low level...the rationale behind not changing names is so
that you don't have a way of escaping a bad server reputation. At low
levels, this is hardly an issue.

On general principle, I destroy and re-create any pet that comes up with
that name.
