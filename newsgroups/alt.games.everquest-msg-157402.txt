Because the client version has to match the server version, and the same
client is used to connect to all servers, so basically all servers have to
be the same version at the same time. You could accomplish this by having a
different downloadable client for different servers, but I guess thats too
much bother for them.
Anyway, if you think you have it tough in europe, try .au when the patches
start at 8 pm :P (as well as pings around 220 on cable)
