You can run some tests yourself.  But unless you have SHOWEQ running the
actually value of a mob will only be guess work.  But here is how to do it.

The new UI allows you to customize it.  There are many player created UIs
that you can download.  www.eqinterface.com is a good site for these.  You
can have a UI that includes a percentage number allong side your exp bar.
So instead of figuring out how much of a blue bubble you got for a mob you
will see the percentage.  Unfortunately I have not seen one that gives
fractions of a percent.  Go into a zone and kill 20 or so mobs of the same
type that give you exp and see how much your EXP went up.  If you do more
like 30 or 40 the number will be more mathmatically meaningful.  The reason
is a mob has both stronge members spawn and easy members spawn.  If you kill
a large enough population of a particular creature then you will have a
better average of what a typical one gives you.  Then after you level do the
same thing again using the same number of creatures.  If you do this for a
couple levels then you will have a pretty good understanding of exp and
could write it down for future reference so when you start work on your alt,
that you more than likely will create, you will know what to hunt in a given
zone.  If you know what creatures give the best exp in a zone then you will
focus on those instead of the others.

I do believe that if you kill a mob that is higher level than you are you
get some added exp bonuses.  Not excactly sure.  For example, Hill Giants
have conned dark blue to my warrior for over 8 levels now.  But since dark
blue is below my level then I doubt I would get any added exp bonus for
killing them eventhough as a warrior, if I tried to solo a Hill Giant he
would probably kick my butt.  If the Hill Giant was white then he would be
even and of course yellow or red then he would be above my level.  Since he
was higher level then I believe I would get an added exp bonus for killing
him.  I think these were added to the game to prevent rapid exp gains off of
common mobs at these levels.  In the higher level game, dark blues will kick
your butt real quick.  But if you kill them you get some exp but it is not
overly abundant.

So after all of that long winded post, I think you are correct in your
hypothesis that exp from mobs is based on the actual exp value of the mob
plus any bonuses that your level may give you.  If you are higher than the
mob then you do not get these bonuses, only the exp value of the mob.

I have not used showeq in ages and do not know if it is still a viable
option.

Here is a screenshot of what showeq used to spit out.

By the way.  If you run showeq or any other packet sniffing software then
you are in violation of the EULA and can have your account banned.
