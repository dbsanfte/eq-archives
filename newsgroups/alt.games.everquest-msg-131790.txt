PBS Not Planning HIV-Infected Muppet for U.S.
Wed Jul 17, 4:25 AM ET
By Pamela McClintock

WASHINGTON (Variety) - Soothing concerns raised by Republican lawmakers, Public
Broadcasting System said Tuesday it has no intention of introducing an HIV (
news - web sites)-infected Muppet to American airwaves.



Rather, the new Sesame Workshop character is intended for South African
audiences only.

In a letter dispatched to Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and other solons, PBS
president Pat Mitchell explained that Sesame Workshop is an independent
organization that developed the new Muppet in concert with South African
educators and the U.S. Agency for Intl. Development.

The female, HIV-infected Muppet will bow Sept. 30 on "Takalani Sesame," as the
local version of the show is known.

"There are no plans to incorporate this character or curriculum into 'Sesame
Street' on PBS," Mitchell said.

Tauzin and other politicians said they didn't think it would be appropriate to
bring the Muppet to the U.S., reminding Mitchell in a letter sent over the
weekend that Congress has financial oversight of PBS.

Top Tauzin aide Ken Johnson said that his boss was satisfied with Mitchell's
response.

"The issue is over," Johnson said. "We had a real simple argument -- let kids be
kids. They are going to grow up fast enough. They are going to learn about AIDS
( news - web sites), world famine and terrorism soon enough. Why can't they
laugh and play for a while?"

It's another story when it comes to AIDS-ravaged South Africa, where one in nine
people are estimated to have the human immuno-deficiency virus, which causes
AIDS.

The new Muppet is intended to humanize and de-stigmatize people with HIV or
AIDS. Character will be "lively, friendly and an active participant" in all
adventures featured on the show.

"There was an overwhelming local desire and passion to bring this issue to the
program," said Robert Knezevic, Sesame Workshop's assistant VP for international
projects.

Dirk Dijkerman, the U.S. Agency for Intl. Development's director in South
Africa, said the new Muppet is a "tremendous teaching opportunity" that will
reach almost 14 million people per week via TV and radio.

Johnson said Tauzin doesn't have a problem with the involvement of U.S. aid in
the South African project


my only other thought is God forbid we should teach our children tolerance.
