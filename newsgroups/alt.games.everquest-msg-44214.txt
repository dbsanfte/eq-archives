 Sebilis is safe to zone in. It's just not that safe if you want to get
out. On my server you'll normally find quite a few people in Sebilis
looking for a group. Chardok I don't think I've ever really seen that.
It will be interesting if the upcoming Chardok changes will lure more
people there. Maybe people will be 'LFG Chardok Group' in Burning Woods
and then head in once formed. 

 Of course, they also shouldn't make it so difficult to make it to the
zone in spot. There's what, 4-6 sarnaks guarding the gate and another
two at the spot where you enter the fortress. Unless you have invis that
right there is a major deterrent to wandering.
