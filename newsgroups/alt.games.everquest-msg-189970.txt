It used to be easy - pull the mob, let it hit you, let your animation  
almost kill it, then mez, and mem-blur until it forgets.  I used to PL 
people while farming the Evil Eyes many levels ago with this method.  
Downside is a severe lack of skillups.

Pets are still breaking mez ( as of last night ), so it doesn't work so 
well anymore.  A charmed pet would be a good choice with mobs that run so 
you can just call it off and blur.

Or, if PLing the lower levels, cast Feedback, Haste, Shadow, Berserker STR, 
etc. on the char, and pull.  Slowing negates some of the DS, but it's a 
tradeoff of what you need more - damage absorption or damage shielding.  
The PLee gets skillups this way, at least.
