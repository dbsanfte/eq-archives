I'll throw my 2ï¿½ in too then!  I love those stories, so much so I made
the website (which is getting visitors daily, btw).  I'm glad your still
writing them.  I also thought it was great of you to put in a story where
you didn't get the uber loot.  I think we've all been there before.
Keep up the good work!
