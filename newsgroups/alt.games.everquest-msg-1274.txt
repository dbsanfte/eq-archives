One cannot help but recall that your contributions to the group are
virtually nil. While some people may not like those of us you named
directly, and we often disagree with one another, something we all
have in common is that *we* contribute to this group. Of course, since
you're only interested in name-calling, you'll no doubt continue to
ignore that fact.
