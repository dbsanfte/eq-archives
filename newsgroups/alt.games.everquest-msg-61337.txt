In this day and age you will never get rich with a Trade Skill. Trade skills
are for your personal enjoyment and use.

 I have a Jeweler with a 250 skill level. The only reason she is a 250 is to
make stuff for me and our guild. I created her 2 years ago and made money
with her I am still willing to bet she is the only level 5 with a skill over
200 on Prexus. the way her bonus points are set up she could never make it
past 20. She was created to be a TradeSkill mule only. In this day there are
no demand for low level Jewelry so you will go broke before you can start
making profit. Also only High levels or twinks are willing to pay the
difference between Plat and Velium for 1 additional point Velium Jewelry is
the biggest rip-off of the game Plat Bars 105p Velium Bars 252p Plat ring
4int Velium ring 5int

Tailoring is useless as a money maker unless you are willing to get the
skill over 200 there are very few Tailors with a high enough skill level to
make the great Items again you will need a guild to get the furs and skins
necessary to make them very difficult to get form 160 to 200+ very few
things that can be made to advance skill without major failures and no
longer a demand for low level stuff

Blacksmithing is like Jewelry cost out weighs the profit.

The only way Trade skill would become profitable is to require maintenance
on everything Weapons degrade (damage drops) with use and need sharpening,
Armor needs to be reforged or stiched, Jewelry needs to be polished and gems
need reseting. The worst the Damage the higher the skill level required to
fix it.
