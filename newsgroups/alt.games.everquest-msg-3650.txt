Ok I will bite.

Sword (or should I more correctly say Butter Knife), I can tell by your
email address that you are probably a useless FA player who has come to EQ
to try and survive in the game more than 20 seconds without being killed.
That would be a 15 second improvement on your FA game performance.

We EQ players all wait with baited breath for you grand arrival into the
game. Please buy it and get a subscripition so we can gently introduce you
to some of the finer aspecs of playing it.
