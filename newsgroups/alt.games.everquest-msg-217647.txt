Phinny isn't Kunark, he's old world.  And his guards are much more of a
pain than he is... They are highly magic resistant and proc a stun that
is similar to Whirl 'til You Hurl, except that it isn't broken by melee.
Phinny's just a fairly boring L55ish boss who summons, I tanked him
easily at L54 with no gear better than cultural (so why don't I have a
damned dusty finger bone then, anyway?).
