He was perfectly clear, you are just inept.


you can log on your char, consent one of your other characters, log out and
get on the char you consented, and then DRAG the corpse to a safe spot via
/corpse

you will note he did not say anything about SUMMONING a corpse this way, he
did however specifically say drag.
