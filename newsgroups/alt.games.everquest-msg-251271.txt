Magazine content is generally written about 6 months before publication, 
so PCGamer's release date estimate was probably put together long before 
the one EBGames is currently using at their stores.

EQ2 apparantly has little to do with EQ other than sharing some basic 
concepts and a history.  Nobody suggested boycotting SWG until EQ bugs 
were fixed.

In fact, EQ2 looks to be more of an EQ lite than the sequel to EQ; an EQ 
designed for the casual gamer, with hopes that any serious players who 
get immeshed in it will migrate to the "real" EQ.  While this may still 
mean lots of current, casual EQ players move to EQ, any such sideways 
move doesn't really benefit SOE much, they do get to sell another box, 
but they don't get a new monthly account fee, in most cases people will 
cancel one account when getting the other (whichever direction they move)

If you want to send a message about EQ, the thing to do would be to 
engineer another "work stoppage" in EQ itself.  Cancel your account and 
send an email telling them you'll be back when you hear the bugs are 
fixed.  Convince as many people as you can to do the same.

Threatening not to buy EQ2 until EQ is fixed makes little sense, if they 
fix EQ you are just going to abandon it anyway!

Lance

ps: I'm no fan of EQ2, and still wish they'd never started the project 
and instead devoted the same resources to EQ.  Far too late for that, 
though, IMO.  With luck, it will flop, and they'll turn their attention 
back to the cash cow they already have.  I just don't think your 
particular approach to doing this (promise to make EQ2 not flop if they 
fix EQ) makes logical sense.
