A couple comments:

(1) There don't seem to be quests for Fishing or Research, if that matters
to you.

(2) Pretty much the only way to get there nowadays is via Magus, so you'll
pretty much need to be at least level 15.

(3) Wis/Int gear won't make much difference in how long it takes.  I've
done some with no wis gear (at 86) and some with a bunch (at 110) and only
rarely did I fail to max out skill at the breakpoints on the first stack
of attempts. Couldn't tell you whether a geerlok at such low skill levels
would make a noticeable difference.
