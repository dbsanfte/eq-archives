You don't see any difference, huh?  None at all?  So, if you did something
to me I didn't like, you'd find it perfectly ok for me to go and torture and
kill your kids because I didn't think I was strong enough to hurt you
personally?  Well now, that makes a whole fuckload of sense, doesn't it!
Poor innocent Palestinians are just targeting and slaughtering hundreds of
innocent civilians because they can't fight the Israeli army... poor guys,
you can't be too hard on them, they're just using the weapons they have!
And I suppose you'll tell me that when your country's army goes to war,
innocent civilians never ever die in the crossfire?
