The Evil That Men Do
Find this song on Sheet music, CD
(Smith/Dickinson/Harris)
Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daugter, her eyes red with
The slaughter of innocence
But will pray for her.
I will call her name out loud.
I would bleed for her.
If only I could see her now.

Living on a razors edge.
Balancing on a ledge.
Living on a rasors edge.

The evil that men do lives on and on.... } 4 times

Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me.
But I will pray for you.
And some day I may return.
I would die for you.
Beyound is where I learn.
