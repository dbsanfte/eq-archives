I've got less than you do, and I'm cruising right along:

400MhZ Celeron
384MB RAM
Cheesy 1.5 year old ATI card I got when Kunark first came out.

All character models selected.
Sound *on*
Texture compression *on*
Detail *low*
Resolution 800x600
Dynamic lighting *off*

It's very playable, all around Luclin.  In the very most
detailed zones (i.e., downtown Catville), it helps to
turn my clipping plane down to about half.  Other than that,
things are beautiful.

I'm also doing quite well on a 500MhZ Celeron with 512MB and
the crappy Intel 810 chipset.

Fiddle with your settings, or make sure you've got the latest
video drivers or something, you ought to be doing even
better than my two machines.
