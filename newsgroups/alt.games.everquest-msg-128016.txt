But you're also not taking into account another big reason people
don't play D2 anymore: cheaters.  The realms are SO full of hacks and
duplicated items, it's just not fun anymore.  EVERYONE has EVERYTHING
thanks to Blizzards totally ineptness on how to deal with hacks, and
its week-late messages about massive duping without shutting the
realms down.  That's the main reason I haven't played Diablo, nor any
Blizzard product, in almost 6 months.
