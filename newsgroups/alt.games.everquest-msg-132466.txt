I also use the Nexus as often as possible. Aside from that, 3pp to 5pp
is fine as long as the encounter starts with something along the lines
of, "Need a port to [insert location] - paying 5pp." If that happens
to be all I have on that char at the time (which is far too often) I
will usually not even bother asking. I have two good legs and a thirst
for adventure, and I'm not afraid to use 'em.  :)

First and foremost, I try to be self-sufficient. It's always a good
idea.
