How'd he manage that?  Serious crushbone slaughter?  Hope he didn't end up 
KoS to Indigo Brotherhood...

} Now he wants to go to the Plane of Growth and see if
}Tunare likes him to.  I'm nervous about this.  I want to go see my god
}also, but him, I want to wait till the new graveyard is in place.  Just in
}cast they hate him so much there that they camp his corpse till his body
}rots.

Well... he could zone in and FD, while you run across the zone, target 
Tunare, and run back, then have him assist you and con.  Just make sure 
you bring a nonkos porting-class friend, I never did manage to find the 
zoneout in that place. :)

Even better, do your running part first, so he can just zone in, assist, 
and con, while the porter's already firing up the gate spell.  Surely that 
whirling whatsis at the zonein can't kill him in 8 seconds...
