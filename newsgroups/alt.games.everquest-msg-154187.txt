I quite often over price items I am in no hurry to get rid of.  For
instance, I have a blue diamond.  I am only lvl 48 so resist gear is not
imperitive to me at this time.  Instead of it sitting in the bank until I
decide to have an enchanter make me some resist piece, I put it on my trader
and price it at 2700 (going rate on Brell is 2200-2500).  If someone picks
it up, I buy another for 2500 and make 200pp.

Peace,
Xytrex (48 Wizard of Brell)
