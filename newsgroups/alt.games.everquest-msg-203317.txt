Yes but the KEI is level appropriate for them now.
KEI is necessary for the High levels to stay equivalent to
what Breeze, C1, and C2 were for the lower levels.
Its all relative to their levels.

Those that leveled up on KEI are in for a shock when KEI
is no longer the uber boost it once was. There is no Level 80 KEI3
for them to beg for in the Nexus or PoK.
