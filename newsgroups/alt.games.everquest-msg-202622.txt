Oh no!  The keyboard warrior is after me!

What shall I do?  What shall I do?

You hate it when you lose an argument, don't you?  And you think by saying
"No one has shown me yet" enough times you'll win.

Guess what?  It's not about winning.  It's about a change that someone else
has made.  A change that you're powerless to do a thing about.  A change
that I'm powerless to do a thing about.

No matter what, you're going to have to deal with it.  Whether you choose to
do so with or without the whine is strictly up to you.

But thumping your chest in this NG isn't going to change the fact that
you're just going to have to deal with it.

Pity, isn't it?
