I'm running a Celeron 500 with 400 meg of ram, a GF2 32 meg card and a DSL line.
From my own personal experience I would upgrade everything on my system except
the DSL. Most zones aren't real bad but when you are in the Kitty City it gets
real Jerky, but the problem is not lag its frame rate, I allways have my
Lag/Packet Loss Meter up and I am usually around 100/myside 400/serverside on
lag and usually 0/packetloss, so that leads me to the conclusion that its my CPU
and Video Card that are having the probs, not to mention that I only have 400
meg of ram which means I can only run a limited amount of the new chars and none
of the emotes. I would run atleast a 1gig CPU and would upgrade to a 64 meg
Video Card <my preference would be the GF 3 64 DDR>, and since ram is so cheap I
would install 1 gig atleast of that. Hope that helps :)
