No it's the same thing exactly - someone following around another person
and harassing them.

Oh that's cute.  
You have a definition of Kill Stealing from a game with quite different
mechanics and you're declaring that definition to be the one "most
reasonable players" would have in ALL games.

This is CoH not EQ, kindly leave your EQ baggage at the door.

True to a point.  
But if multiple people petition because player X stole a kill from them
AND is doing it to everyone then action will be taken.

Once a GM sees someone doing this, they get warned off or suspended.

Name one game that doesn't have someone exploiting a loophole somewhere.

The problem here is that the term kill stealing arose from a system
where ALL the exp went to the one that landed the killing blow.
This, and killing a rare spawn you've been camping and therefor "own" in
some sense is real kill stealing.
But CoH doesn't really have any rare spawns, and you always get a share
of exp on any mob you damage (if you're in the level range to get exp.)

Kill stealing as defined for most MMOGs does not and cannot exist in CoH
because the underlying system is different.

Your EQ definitions DO NOT FIT so don't try to apply them.

No.  
The activity cited by KDragon would definitely get the follower warned
off in CoH.  
If that person did not stop they'd get their account suspended.  
It's happened.

What a court would say is irrelevant, it's Cryptic's playground, they
define what harassment is and they've made it clear that following
someone around and interfering with their fun is not permitted.

It annoys me as well, but most of the time i've encountered it, it's
been simultaneous attacks, or someone shooting from range and not seeing
me, or someone thinking they're helping you because you were heavily
wounded and it looked like you were going to die.
(and of course the old favorite of targeting a mob and having and "auto"
attack fire off.)
I tell them I don't want/need their help - they go away.

I've also had people assist me in other ways, totally unasked, from
random heals, to controllers sleeping the mobs, to higher level
tankers/scrappers with provoke pulling mobs off me and onto them (but
not damaging the mobs) so I get hit less while I finish off the ones
still on me.


If someone follows me around and "helps" me kill repeatedly, i'll
petition and a GM will MAKE them stop or suspend their account.


Your "intent" to kill is irrelevant because you don't (and can't) "own"
a critter in CoH.
No ownership = no kill stealing, that's the rules, like it or not.

There is no such thing as kill stealing in CoH, there is harassing
behavior.

And here we have your bias to other MMOGs.   
With the exception of the halloween "trick" door spawns, you can't have
done _any_ work to spawn a mob in CoH.

There's no ultra rare foozle you have to camp for 16 hours to get access
to in order to get some ultra rare drop.

The only thing that even comes close to that is the "Monster" types like
the Kraken in Perez or Babbage in Boomtown, and killing them gets you
nothing but a badge, so it's hardly vital that you EVER kill them.
[Even then, with the advent of Badges for killing them, their spawn
rates were turned WAY up.]

Even "camping" doesn't work since CoH is specifically designed to NOT
spawn if you're camped too close to the spawn point- something a lot of
ex-EQ players never seem to get. 
Saw this all the time in King's Row with people sitting on the CoT spawn
points waiting for CoT, but unknowingly stopping them from appearing.
I told many people about this and they refused to believe it and kept on
camping.  [The rooftops NW of Blue Steel.]
So I just headed off to the less well known CoT spawn points and
finished my mission while they waited endlessly complaining about the
"rare" CoT.
They aren't rare at all, they appear at the spawn points in King's Row
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, unless something else is occupying the spawn point
be it player or another critter type.

In umpteen characters and 40 levels of my current main character I have
NEVER EVER *had* to kill anything that I had to wait more than 30
minutes to get.
The closest CoH gets to this is the kill X missions

It's not EQ, why are you insisting that CoH have the same meanings that
EQ does when it's a radically different game?
