Lower 50's I would say some good solo spots are Dreadlands (skelly camp
easiest to avoid adds), BW (near giant fort to avoid adds), Emerald Jungle
and TT.  Another easy spot to solo is by pooling Wyverns in Cobalt Scar down
to the beach ... think 50% of them were blue at level 55 and the
occasionally drop quest gems.

The thing is once you hit the upper 50's, blue mobs that you can
successfully take out probably become much harder to find.
