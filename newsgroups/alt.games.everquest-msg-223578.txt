The bugs in the hidden tunnels are a design mistake.   One that sort of
annoys me.   They are not too tough, and would be great experience and nice
loot to kill in your mid to late 50's.   But that part of the zone has walls
that are wayyyy too thin.   If you go in there with anyone under level 60,
thier aggro raidius is high enough that mobs will aggro on the other side of
the wall, and massive trains will appear out of nowhere to absolutely
destroy you.     After level 60 you can walk through and only get one
tunnel's worth of mobs at a time... but by then they're no longer a
challenge or good experience, since you're too high level.
