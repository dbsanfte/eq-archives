Actually there are. and lots of them.  Borer and Pincer Beetles.  I suggest
you go back to NK sometime and take a look.  I feel your argument is wearing
thin now.  You have switched form saying a wizard is not that good at
soloing to saying that there are lots of people wanting to kill the same
mobs.  That is the same anywhere you go in the game.  And think however it
is for a wizard to go somewhere else when a particular area/zone is
overcamped.  the gnolls in Iceclad for instance i have never seen anyone
else hunting them ever.  In the Overthere there is more than enough mobs to
support all the groups and quad kiters.  In cobalt scar the respawn rate is
so fast that i have never had to wait on a spawn... there have always been
at least 4 up at a given time.  Dwarfs in Butcherblock (another excellent
quad kiting place for low 40's) are not often camped and are plentiful.
This is the same in all the zones i have ever quad kited in (Skyfire, The
Grey, Fungus Grove, etc etc etc theres so many to choose from)

Netherless i have enjoyed this discussion immensely, and for that i thank
you :)
