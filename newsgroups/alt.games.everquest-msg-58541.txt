You obviously already know the roles - you're searching for scope and
meaning in your rangers job description. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad
news - but you've already seen the extent of your role in a group. You
deal damage. That's it. Anything else you do is an afterthought, and not
really needed all that much.

Main Tank: Damage sponge and aggro holder, primary role. Damage dealer
secondary role. Not a lot to say here. No frills in this job description,
but it's probably the single most important role in the game.

Meat Grinders (Secondary tanks): Primary role of anyone that can dish out
significant melee damage - rangers, sks, paladins, rogues, monks, and
warriors obviously. This means you Frank.

Nuker: Casting class or hybrid with good DDs and DoTs. Other abilities
helpful like damage shields, buffs, debuffs, root-parking etc. Any casting
class can fill this role, even melee hybrids. Some obviously are better at
it. (Pure casters)

Healer: Cleric, shaman, even druids and paladins. Anyone that can help
keep other teammates alive and minimize downtime via direct
healing. Primary role. Secondary role: buffing. Tertiary, debuffing.

Crowd Control: Enchanters and Bards. Primary role is to stand back and
manage the flow of battle. Watch for and deal with the adds as they come
in. (Mez, charm, root-park, or even a nice bardic kite while the group
deals with their current problems) Communicate to group what's next on the
groups own "Hate list". With good crowd control a group can be in nearly
continuous combat for hours on end with minimal downtime and no losses.
Usually downtime is limited only by the pullers inability to find
something to kill ;-) Secondary role is Healer Bodyguard. If the cleric
takes aggro from a secondary mob in a multi-mob fight, it's the crowd
controllers job (and NOT THE MEAT GRINDERS) to get that aggro back under
control (Mez or root-park it so the cleric can get clear of it)  Tertiary
role is to act as a force multiplier for other groupmates. Melee hastes,
mob slows and debuffs and assist in downtime reduction - mana and health
regen. Biggest job description, hard to do it well, stunningly useful when
done well, CR nightmares when done poorly.

You? You're a ranger. Your job is to stand beside the main tank and dish
out damage. That's pretty much it as far as your job description. If you
were looking for something else to do, or a more challenging and rewarding
group experience, choose a more complex class. (Don't get me wrong, I
-like- rangers, but their role in a group is very limited)

Try an enchanter for awhile. The first time at 16 that someone empties the
throne room in Crushbone and you and your little 6 person group of 14 and
16s not only stop the resulting train but **CRUSH** it at the bridge in a
long, stressful, exhilirating fight is when you will never go back to your
ranger again. (Worked for me ;-)
