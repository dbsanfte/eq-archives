I didn't tell you to do anything. I know you desperately want to be
indignant over being ordered about, but I didn't order you about. I gave
you some advice. I explained my reasons for giving the advice, and you
clearly want to take offense over that. 

But, hey, if you want to associate with an undersocialized high school
cave dwarf like Reg, be my guest. It'll give you something to do while
you figure out how adults talk.
