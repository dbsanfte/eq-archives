We are not a profit based organization, nor selling a product if you
didn't notice. However, hosting a forum of our size requires a
dedicated server. Message board software of better quality than PHP
costs money and none of them are one-time payments either. With the
banner at the top and an optional donation link we share the costs
precisely like we've done at ezboard which made us pay a load more for
a lot less.

If the platinum advertisement bothers you then don't visit our forum.
It's as easy as that. We don't get rich from them, nor does the banner
cover the monthly hosting costs. You should read up about the AdSense
program before complaining because Google's bots decided that EverQuest
related banners should be displayed on that majority of the pages, not
us.
