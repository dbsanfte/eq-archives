Yeah, I was disapointed that Kaladim was 5 zones deep and each only
amounted to the equivalent of half a city block. Freeport and Qeynos
zones seemed to be 4-10 times bigger. And the high elf city wasn't even
a seperate zone. hehe

Actually, the best armor a dwarven Pally can wear is quest armor. It is a
green scarab armor. The building in front of the pool has a weapon merchant
that gives this quest. It involves killing scarab beetles (also appropriate 
for
your lvl) I wish I could give you more info on this quest, but I have been
away from EQ1 for 3 years now. But I STILL remember questing for this
armor. It looked AWESOME on my pally.

Sony decided that the Pally LOH was worth the price of a pet and a
slower progression of spells. If you are only LOH yourself, it doesn't
seem like it, but remember that it can heal higer levels MUCH more.
I made a little coin from higher-ups for a timely LOH as I ran by.

Some of the best exp as well as the most populated hunting on that
continent is in Kaladim area. Then move on to Greater Faydark.
Crushbone is a varitable Cornicopia of exp and items when you
get high enough.
