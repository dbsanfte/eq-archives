Due to hardware design, 50% slower.  Due to good programming, only about 25%
slower.

I own a 5900 and a 9800.  Post all the links you want, I'm playing games
with them and relying on practical experience, not benchmarks that both
companies can (and have) "tricked".  The 5900 is the faster card until I
turn on too many bells and whistles (and I have to turn on a *lot* of bells
and whistles to really impact either card).  I will give the ATI card credit
in its handling of particle effects, which, while they aren't visually as
nice, are a helluva lot faster.

I've had Nvidia driver releases give me a 10% speed boost from the same
hardware I was using the day before.  Ever had that happen with an ATI
driver?  I haven't seen it yet.  I'm honestly not sure it's possible due to
the way the cards are "hard" designed.

You go run some benchmarks.  I've got games to play.  =)

On the bright side, Microsoft has been looking for a video card company to
consume.  That will give them a good hardware maker, and maybe even solve
ATI's lack of good driver programmers.  Can you see it coming?   =)
