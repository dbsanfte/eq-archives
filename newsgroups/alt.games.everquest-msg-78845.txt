I actually submitted a bug report online to eqtech@sony.eq.com and got a
response (that email address is coming from my brain at 6am in the morning
so may be wrong)...
They say that they are aware of this problem and are working with ATI to get
a new driver that will work...I experience the same thing you do and also i
can see the inside of my face when i am fighting, after installing SoL and
using new character models...

For the time being i suggest that when you get on the boat hit f9 a couple
of times zoom all the way out and do the best you can :(...good luck.
