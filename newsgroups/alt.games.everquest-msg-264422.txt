It doesn't take much skill to go to a web site and check up on the
monster you're fighting, or even to pull it once and realise it was
harder than you expected[1].  With the variation in what up arrows can
mean in EQ 2, I don't think this is lost, really, unless you spend
your time going just for the non-two-up-arrow monsters.  But doing
that is much like going to a web site like Ilia's bestiary and looking
for the safe route, except it's done in game for you - the good stuff
requires killing the hard mobs, anyway.

That's not to say I like it - I'd prefer it if you had to learn the
hard way, because that's generally more exciting.  Just remove the
whole con system, that would be more interesting, at least if you
didn't have rats that can kill dragons and so on.


[1] Although you could say the skill is knowing about many, many mobs
and their difficuly, I guess
