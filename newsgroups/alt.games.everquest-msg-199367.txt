 Not every guild has 60+ people on during raiding hours. Personally I
don't like dual-boxed clerics, particularly when they are in my group,
but it sure beats the alternative of no cleric.

 1k a tick for 3 ticks I believe. So 3k total in 12 seconds.Unless you
mean his recycle time. In which case it's 45 seconds. Although I should
probably check Lucy before I state that as fact. Except I'm too lazy
this morning.

 Technically that's correct. There's no way "through" the wall but there
is a way inside. And it doesn't involve levitation. It's rather painful
though but I imagine that was the designers intention. I'm surprised
they haven't called the lev trick an exploit and patched it out already.
Not that I'm complaining or anything...

 Agreed. We have.. Hmm.. 5 or so guilds in the Elemental planes. Most
everything is dead within a day. And of course the guilds not in Eles
are hitting Ssra, VT and heck even ToV. So by day two there's usually
nothing up anywhere.
