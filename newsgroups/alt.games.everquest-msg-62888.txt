Your interpretation of my initial post is interesting.  Let's examine
my initial post carefully:

Well.  Let me see.  I don't see where I postulate malice or
conspiracy.  I do see some facts: they've disabled Alt+Tab (to
the best of their ability) and there is a lot of downtime in the game
(I spend most of my time staring at the spellbook when I've chosen
to solo).

Do you disagree with either of those two things?

(Pick up a dictionary and look up the word "postulate".  You obviously
don't know the definition.)

I see you have a reading comprehension problem.  How sad for you.

I am not blaming EQ for Link Dead problems.  I'm aware of how the
Internet works.  I'm also aware that my cable modem company is less
than reliable.  I'm also aware that Link Dead problems cause my
character to die.  A level 8 wizard on orc hill that is link dead
and stands completely idle while being attacked by a gang of orc
centurions doesn't stand much chance.

Do you disagree?

Wow.  You sure claim I came to a lot of conclusions I didn't!
Let's look at the part of my initial post you seem to be commenting
on.

Dear oh dear oh dear.  It seems we've uncovered another glaring
problem with your reading comprehension!  Perhaps you'd care to
carefully point out the part where I come to the conclusion that
"...it couldn't possibly be a driver problem because I've tried
some unspecified combination of drivers".

I merely was trying to short circuit the obvious answer most people
would come up with: update your drivers.  My comment was merely
meant to say, "Please don't give me that answer.  I've tried that.
I've tried some older stable drivers, I've tried the latest drivers."

Nor did I ever claim that I couldn't be wrong about anything.  That
is another ridiculous fabrication that you've decided to come up with.
You're quite a dishonest man, Mr. Jekke.  Shame on you.  You're not
supposed to fabricate things the other party said out of thin air.

Since you've displayed a serious lack of reading comprehension,
let me know if you'd like me to tell you this a few more times,
perhaps using smaller words.

: You can be wrong. You are wrong.

And, interestingly enough, I never claimed otherwise!  You horse's
ass, you.

: And, you give professional developers
: a bad name when you demonstrate overweening arrogance in the face of
: your own inability to adequately troubleshoot a problem.

Let me give you a clue, oh Pointy Haired Boss: some problems CANNOT
be solved.  It's quite possible my sound card (SB AudioPCI 64V) has
drivers that just plain _do not work_ reliably with EQ 100% of the
time.  At the current time, that is my best guess, since EQ sound
has always been wacky for me.

However, I _do_ remain suspicious of EQ, since Unreal Tournament,
Baldur's Gate II, Diablo II, Deus Ex, and a few other games whose
names I don't recall at this time, all work without the slighest
stability problems.  Or sound problems, for that matter.  This
points a mighty big finger at EQ.  I'm not saying EQ is doing
something wrong, but EQ might be making some API calls these other
games _do not_ make, which triggers the bad driver code.

You give developers and development managers a bad name by fabricating
conclusions I never came to, and by responding in an obnoxious and
accusational way.  If your response hadn't been so obviously damning
and insulting, this kind of discussion would never have started,
now would it?

Learn how to behave like a human being instead of a jackass.  The
anonymity the Internet and Usenet gives you isn't an exuse to act
in the manner you have.

Grow up, boy.
