I have left your post untouched, much though it pains me to. 

If you are a 24th Necro casting whatever spell against a 25th level mob, 
that spell will be resisted (whether that resist means the spell has no 
effect or that it has reduced damage) more often than if you were a 26th 
Necro casting on a 25th mob.

If there were a buff that made your Warrior hit for max damage say, 10% 
more often, would you find it worthwhile? Or, for that matter, a buff that 
made you hit Crits more often? The difference between this spell (assuming 
it acts as speculated)  and Tash is the same as the difference as a 
Haste spell on a tank and a Slow spell on a mob.

Seriously, ask any casters that you meet if their spells land more often 
against yellow or blue mobs.
