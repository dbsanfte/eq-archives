I switched to a Radeon 9200 w/128MB DDR last week (My geforce4 TI 4200
failed) and it works quite well. The only place I have ANY problem
with lag is in the Bazaar when I get too close to densely populated
areas full of traders.
But I also have 1GB system DDR as well, and a chipset which gives me
18% added graphics bandwidth. Your mileage may vary. On the whole, it
was very cost effective upgrade from say, myold Geforce 2 MX 400 64MB.
