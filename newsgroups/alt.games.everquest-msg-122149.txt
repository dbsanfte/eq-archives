All my stuff was easy to get - I didnt "work" or trade for it (except
the horsie). You were asking for stuff to ugprade your wizzie and
the easiest way for me to show you some stuff that was, by definition,
not hard to get (I soloed for most of it and it accumulated in my
bank for ages till I decided to make an int caster) was to show you
it ;)

Yes, yes I was. And moreso; I rode it *inside* unrest and up and down
the stairs, giggling all the while ;)

Oh, no, I meant more a methodology to test how much mana we get sub-200
int and post-200 int, given the gear available and the character.

See? To work it out properly, ourselves, so we could conclusively know
