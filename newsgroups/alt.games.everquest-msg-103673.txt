Ok, this is going  back a loooong way, 3 years and 3 days to be excact. I
was playing my newbie Half Elven druid outside Surefall Glade. Not many had
a lot at the time, but we helped eachother as we could. A level 10 (To me
that was WAY high level) came over to me, and asked if I wanted some armor.
I said sure, and handed him all my ruined cat pelts, and he made me some
tatterd armor... I was SOOO proud. He remained one of my best EQ friends for
nearly 2 years, until he left the game. :o) Then there was the half elven
druid named Lotte, who showed me Qeynos and how to forage, and all kinds of
neat druid tricks. I never asked for anything, I just got given good advice
as a complete newbie... And it felt great. Perhaps others should try this?
:o)

Solitude :o)

p.s. Sorry for ranting on so much :o)
