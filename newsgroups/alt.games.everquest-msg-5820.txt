Yawn...... I myself, have already given up on you m8ee.  I grow tired of
the mindless rhetoric that you are so accustomed to. Although, I am enjoying
watching the uncontrollable twitching that has obviously overtaken your
every movement. May I suggest an antidote to your dilemma? Yes? Ok thank
you. First off you will need to remove your right hand from the k-board, no
not that one, the other one. Ok good, now turn it palm side up, look at it
closely, then extend your right arm outward to the right side of your
cranium. Ya with me so far? Good, now I want you to pull your right palm
towards your right cheek, but with the force that one would use to send a
racquet ball sailing through the air at 80mph. In other words, reach up and
smack yourself. This form of self-medication has helped many others in their
time of need in order to stop the twitching. If, and only if this does not
work, then go to the nearest expressway and throw yourself in front of the
oncoming traffic. It may not cure you, but it will put an end to all the
misery you are experiencing.

   Rammer <--- says, let me know if I could be of further assistance in
helping you cure your medical conditions.
