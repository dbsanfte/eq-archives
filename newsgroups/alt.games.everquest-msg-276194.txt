That's about the size of it. MOST of the servers don't experience the
frequent crashing. Only the handful that huge numbers decided to cram
onto who now refuse to play on other servers when traffic on those
servers get so high that it causes the server to crash. Server
transfers will probably help but, really, people need to quit being
stubborn and be willing to roll alts on other servers in the meantime.
