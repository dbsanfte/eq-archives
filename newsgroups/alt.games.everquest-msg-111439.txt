Actually the real question is why they cant wield swords.

Assuming that they are basing druids loosely on the actual celtic ones, the
curved blade is the prefered implement of choice for cutting the neck of
blood sacrifices to enrich the soil for the comming harvest. This is
somewhat hard to do with a staff. Since the word scimitar is I believe
arabian , I have no idea why they chose to call the curved blade that.

A sabre, do achi , or skein would have all been equally as valid. A blade is
curved if you never plan on using the point to thrust, and if it would
otherwise be likely to catch on bone and thus deprive you of your weapon at
a critical juncture. Most cultures used a curved blade at least some of the
time.
