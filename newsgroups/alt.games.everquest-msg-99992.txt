I'm a wizzie, so I will never be involved in this with my main char.  But if
I asked for GFay and got BB, Ben Sisson can stand at the druid ring all day
waiting for payment.  And if he sends me a tell asking for his payment, I
will assure him that payment is forthcoming, as soon as he ports me to GFay,
as agreed.  I feel it is possible that Ben Sisson may yet be trained, as
Pavlovian . . .
