I don't recall if harmony works in there off hand, I am thinking not.  
This will make for an interesting time, but, potentially doable.  You two 
have a lot of experience partnering, that should help.  You'll likely be 
needing to do root CC for adds.  Taking one HT will not be fatal, it's 
when you get several HTing mobs at once that you run into a big problem.  
Sending in the pet, rooting the mobs on it, then taking them one at a 
time could work.
