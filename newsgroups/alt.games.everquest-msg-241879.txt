I certainly dont see why http://eqlive.station.sony.com/ isn't 
considered not counting, it *is* technically the official source of 
information on server availability, changes in the works, patch messages 
and so forth. Patch messages contain the *current* changes, not 
ephemeral patches/vaprowarez. Messages of the day most people ignore, 
and I have never seen one that was doing anything other than reminding 
me to sign up for a fanfaire, update my email information, or to play 
nice and not run with scissors. I have never seen a pop up message 
mentioning  any possible future changes, only flogging stuf they want to 
sell [well, ok - those optional surveys] and I never get any email other 
than from a GM about a problem. I didnt know there was an official eq 
email newsletter. That I might sign up for=)

So since none of the sources you want seem to fit the bill, are we 
supposed to get it via telepathy? <note to self, get my brain retuned, 
the telepathy receptors seem to be fuzzy and not getting any messages=)]
