Ok, I just reactivated. My mage is 12. When I quit, I gave away EVERYTHING.
So I have no int gear, no stat gear period. NOTHING. At 12, I can solo up to
yellows I know, maybe the red mushrooms, but I'm not brave enough to try.
Just /pet attack, let it taunt once, and rain of blades 2 or 3 times. Maybe
heal the pet once or twice, but you shouldn't need it.

There are green/light blue non-aggro mobs all around that you can probably
take at 10. Not great for money, but the experience has been fast and easy.
Just start at Shadeweaver's entrance and work in as you can. By 14 I'll
probably have to group, because the Phlargs are aggro and social.
