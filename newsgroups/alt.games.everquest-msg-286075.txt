Aye, I know what you mean about politics in Guilds.  What a pain in
the frickin' ass it can be.  Some RL pals (some I have known for about
25 to 30 years) and I made a guild just for the 6 of us, partly to
eliminate the whining "sign my charter" whispers and partly just to
chat on Teamspeak and help each other out  on a "when we can" basis.
It works absolutely great. We don't recruit anyone either, so we get
zero politics.

I must have a look at this Hellgate you mention  :)
