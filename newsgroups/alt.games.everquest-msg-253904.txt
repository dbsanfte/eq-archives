Don't be absurd.

So that the local hospital doesn't run out of power, so that cancer 
research can proceed, so that sewage treatment and recycling plants can 
run, so that communication lines can continue to operate, so that 
civilization doesn't collapse. Its not just 'my lights'.

I'm also willing to cut down chunks of forest for wood. Do you think 
that means I want to clear cut the planet and 'obliterate trees and all 
they support just so I can pick my teeth with wooden toothpicks'.
