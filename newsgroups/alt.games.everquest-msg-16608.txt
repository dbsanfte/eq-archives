The 6.4 GB drive is older and slower than the 20GB one.
That's why I only use it for file storage. Windows runs alot faster for me
with the swap file on a seperate harddrive than the OS so ive been doing
that.
The whole system is acting funky so I want a fresh slate, I've done it many
times before but I had always erased EVERYTHING on it first but it looks
like I can save all my important stuff on my 6GB HD like a giant CD and just
get it later.

Thanks or the info!

Anyone else got any experiance or info?
