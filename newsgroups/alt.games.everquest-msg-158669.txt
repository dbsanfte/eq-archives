Hello!

I'm playing EQ again, and all I have is my 37 chanter.  And he's Nekkid.  
And broke.  So, I'm going to be outfitting him with things that are 
attainable via quests, help from friends, drops, and tradeskills.  I will 
have a little bit of $$$ from some friends to start with which will fund my 
tradeskilled items.  I'll have help from level 45+ friends to get some 
drops.

I don't remember a lot of the items in EQ, and I definitely don't know what 
has been added in the last ? months since I stopped playing.  Below is an 
idea of what I plan on getting.  Please give suggestions on the various 
slots.  I will buy some stuff ( like the sarnak dagger ), but would rather 
get most of it without purchasing it.  Either my char or a friend will do 
the tradeskilling.  There are obvious things I'm missing - please point 
them out:

Head      : Runed Circlet?
Face      : CHA and/or INT Jewelry
Neck      : Int Jewelry
Ears      : Int Jewelry
Fingers   : Int Jewelry
Wrists    : Cha bracelets?
Arms      : Gator arms
Hands     : Sol Ro Quest gloves?
Shoulder  : ?
Chest     : Oracle robe to start ( a friend has an extra, I'm sure )
Back      : ?
Waist     : ?
Legs      : ?
Feet      : Sol Ro Quest?  Can't remember.
Primary   : Sarnak Dagger? / Book from Kaessora?
Secondary : GBS from Pyzjn
Range     : ? ( will work on Shawl quests for the range item, I think )
Ammo      : ?

Other Items:
Rallic Pack, Evil Eye bag, Tailored backpacks, ?

Does anyone know if they have changed the Pyzjn spawn or drop?  I don't 
mind spending a few days there to get another GBS.
