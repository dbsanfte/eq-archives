As I pointed out in another thread, this is one of those cases where Flash
of Light is a Paladin's best friend.  It generates aggro like nothing else.
As a 38 Paladin I could take aggro away from a 44 Ranger just about any time
I wanted it.  This, by the way, while using my ever-favourite 2H Axe.  (This
was quite a while ago, though, so things may have changed some.)  In the
case above, you should Snare, the Paladin should FoL, and he should keep on
doing it.

As for what to do otherwise, I'm surprised one good alternative answer
didn't occur to you.  Remove one of your weapons.  Half the weapons, roughly
half the aggro.  Sure, you're not putting out as much damage, but at least
the job's getting done.

Somebody else who's on Xegony!

If you want to try a couple of experiments, get in contact with Gwylliam,
the character I'm playing most often right now.  If I'm free, I'll switch to
Reyder Axeman, come to Overthere and we can try a couple of things.
