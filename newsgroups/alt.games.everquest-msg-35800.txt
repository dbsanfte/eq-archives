Trust me, you're gonna think otherwise once you hit the 50s.  For
example,
a druid guildie of mine FINALLY dinged 60 tonight.  If he had a good day
of earning experience in Lvl 59, he earned a blue bubble about once 
every 2.5 hours. That's 2.6 days PLAYED to get through lvl 59, assuming
he never died-- which is unrealistic since he's a major participant in
our guild's raids.  A level 49 rez can easily cost a half a blue
bubble, and in some of the places we've been lately (like Temple of
Veeshan), multiple deaths are typical per player.  Even with the level
56 rez, death can be costly if a person dies several times during a
raid,
because there is some experience even the level 56 rez can't restore.

If anything-- at least post 50-- the penalties are too harsh.
