Unless it was a scam purely designed to take his money.  That's fraud.  If
they had a contract (emails count), then he also has a civil action against
the person.  Take it to small claims court in his town with copies of emails
and verification of payment and he could get a judgement against the person.
Send out the bill collectors, then.  Even with the tort action, it appears
to be criminal, as well (fraud and wire fraud come to mind).
