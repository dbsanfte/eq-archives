For any given performance level, an appropriate Athlon will be way
cheaper than a P3 or P4.  For any given amount of money, you'll get
better performance from an Athlon than from a P3 or P4.

Don't even think of getting the fastest CPU.  The price/performance
curve gets steeper the higher the performance, and you quickly reach a
point where you are wasting your money.

For example, let's look at P4 CPU prices from www.pricewatch.com:

2.0 GHz $399
1.9 GHz $257
1.8 GHz $206
1.7 GHz $177
1.6 GHz $152
1.5 GHz $137

Look at what the extra 0.1 GHz costs you as you go up:

	$15, $25, $29, $51, $142
