I thought the same thing when I made a shaman.  How can it be worth it for
such a low wisdom.  Shaman is up to level 21, I went with a barbarian.
Reading up on shamans, once you hit level 24 and get canabalize hps > mana.
It is more important to have the hps to turn into mana and both ogres and
trolls have a helluva starting stamania.  Also, I have a iksar necro that
has the regeneration just like trolls.  The answer is yes, it does make a
difference, especially at high levels.
