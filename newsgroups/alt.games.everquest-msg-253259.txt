I agree with you to that extent. I don't know or care what gender most 
players are when I interact with their characters. But that's a far cry 
from them misleading me deliberately and knowingly about that gender.

But what if it turned out the player on the other side was a serial 
rapist, who just happened to play a surly dwarf well. Or if it happened 
to be Madonna but she plays a convincing vah shir bard, or George Dubya 
playing a convincing war-mongering iksar necromancer seeking to 
exterminate all other races [sorry...couldn't resist =)]

Would you count the rapist, Madonna, or the U.S. "P" as your friends? 
Surely not, you don't know them at all.. you might get along with them 
or you might not... but if all you've encountered is a well rped 
character... then what are you operating on as a basis for friendship 
with the other player?

Would you count their characters as your friends? I find the possibility 
quite disconcerting/unnerving on so many levels. To allow myself to 
knowingly develop a relationship like 'friendship' with a completely 
fabricated persona, with no knowledge of the person manufacturing it... 
I could never do it. It strikes me as eerie and wrong... no matter how I 
turn it over in my head.

I can 'enjoy' interacting on that character to character level... but 
would I ever call those other characters friends? without getting into 
their real heads?  No.
