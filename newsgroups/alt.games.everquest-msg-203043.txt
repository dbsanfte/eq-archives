You posted in HTML don't do this.

For a good guide, go to sharkyforums.com and look at their Value gaming
computer.  Buy your stuff at newegg.com and you won't have to worry about
quality vendors.  Look at the more expensive guides and figure out what you
want to do with the extra diff between your budget and their budget.  I
suggest going from 512 ram to 1024 as the price difference on the faster
speed models of ram is practically neglidgible.

Always build a gaming computer yourself.  Don't trust those assholes.

Most important things for a gaming rig are the following in order:
1. Video Card
2. Ram (Quantity)
3. Processor
4. Ram (Speed)

1.   Vid card, for "value" system I would suggest GF4 TI4800 by Gainward or
ASUS, unless you plan on some "extreme" antialiasing, or ridiculous
resolutions.   In order from value to extreme GF4 TI4200, Radeon 9500, GF4
TI4600, Radeon 9700, Radeon 9800, GF5 FX5800.  I wouldn't buy ANYTHING other
than these listed cards.  GF4 TI 4200 is pretty low, but you can do alright,
if you don't crank the resolution
2.  Always have at least 512 Mb of ram.  All the newer mobos allow for ram
parity option (although this applies to option 4) 512 is minimum.
3. Any AMD processor sporting a 333 Mhz FSB should be alright, (entry Barton
2500 is good example of value chip, with same core as 2800 and 3000 if you
want to do "wire trick" to attempt OC, but this will void your warrenty.
But be real careful and watch your temperatures, and never attempt this
without upgrading your cooling.  Remember, only assholes attempt RMA of
chips they broke)  as well as any intel chip with a 533 Mhz FSB or higher
3.  Pc2100 should be the minimum.  With 333 Mhz FSB on AMD machine, it
doesn't make sense not to match system bandwidth though

Moral of the story:  Build your own computer

Here is a 1212$ computer I assembled (some prices may have gone down) all
prices are from newegg

On the left is the quantity and on the right is the price of ALL times (if
2x then indibidual item is 1/2 of price listed)  I know it looks like
quanity times price, I'm sorry

2x  32$ Antec Cobra A26 Round 133 ATA Cable Model 77226 Retail (only need 1
if no EIDE HD)
1x 143$ ANTEC Performance PLUS Model PLUS1080AMG- with Antec Original TRUE
430W P4 Power Supply ATX12V Retail
2x 190$ CORSAIR MEMORY XMS Extreme Memory Speed Series 512MB 64MX64
PC-3200C2PT With Platinum
1x40$ Sony 16X DVD ROM
1x35$ Microsoft Intelli-Mouse Explorer Version 3.0a - New Lighter and
Brighter Silver Accents - OEM Version
1x6$ Antec Keyboard w/offer
1x97$ Windows XP home OEM
1x13$ SAMSUNG 1.44MB FLOPPY DRIVE Model# SFD321B/LEB - OEM, DRIVE ONLY
1x78$ Altec Lansing 251 5.1 Amplified 6-Piece Speaker System - RETAIL
1x169$ Asus V9480TVD 128MB Geforce 4 TI4800SE  (Upgrade possible here to
Leadtek NV30 Geforce FX5800 8XAGP )
1x108$ WD WESTERN DIGITAL "SPECIAL EDITION" 120GB 7200RPM (Upgrade Possible
here to higher Gb model)

1x93$ AMD ATHLON XP 2500 "Barton" 333 FSB PROCESSOR CPU- OEM  (Upgrade
possible here)
1x14$ ANTEC SILVER THERMAL COMPOUND-RETAIL BLISTER PACKAGEMade
1x50$ Swiftech MCX462+ Heatsink (Bare Heatsink Unit).
1x16$ Thermaltake SMART FAN. Variable Fan Speed Control, by temperature
sensor. Fan Dimension: 80x80x25 mm.
1x128$ Asus Motherboard for AMD Athlon/XP/Duron Processors, Model# A7N8X
Deluxe Retail

Now if you want a monitor you will have to cut back.  Find a monitor capible
of at least 1152x864 @ 75 Hz or Khz, whatever the measure is.   I suggest
1280x1024 @ 75  But, it will increase the price of your monitor.   1152x864
is an ok compromise on resolution, but for the sake of your eyes, you don't
want that refresh rate under 75
