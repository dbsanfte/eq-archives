My main is a Level 31 Bard and I have no intention of quitting now. It was
the first character I made, and i have stuck to it.
In fact, i cant last more than a few levels playing as an alt class because
I never have enough to do :). Anything else just seems like playing half a
character.
I also think that this is their downfall. Ive always used a bard so ive
grown accustomed to playing Everquest in that style, whereas most other
bards arent a players first character (you can tell by the huge amount of
level 5's in full lambent) and might be put off by the amount of mouse
activity involved.
