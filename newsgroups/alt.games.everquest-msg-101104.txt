Not trying to start a flame war or anything here, but I possibly 
disagree about your interpretation of "The Vision".  Since Brad 
developed the game, and the game was basically his idea, we are perhaps 
better off with him telling us what we can have or do.  Granted, I like 
the idea of the exp being smoothed out so that the hell levels are gone.  
But it's just something to think about.
