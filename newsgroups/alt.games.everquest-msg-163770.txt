The thread on best and worst changes to the game got me to thinking about
what I want to see next.  I think what I want to see next is a revamp of the
quest interface.  I want two things:

1. A quest journal.  I play at a messy desk in the dark, and so writing down
what I'm supposed to do next doesn't work well--even if I can find the piece
of paper again, I can't read it. :-)  Even if all the quest journal did was
provide a simple copy of the NPC's text, that would help a lot.

2. Let me click on the bracketed text to continue the dialog when talking to
an NPC.  The "try to guess just how I have to phrase what I say to work"
game gets annoying after a while.
