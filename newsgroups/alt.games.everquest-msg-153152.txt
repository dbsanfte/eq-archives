I suppose it's possible that a piece could be composed that utilized
percussion, wind, brass and strings and then only play the pieces that
are actively being used and still sound ok. I do think, like much of
the music, it would get real old.

As an aside, oddly, I tend to like the environmental stuff you get in
different zones - with the FV birds being a *huge* exception.
