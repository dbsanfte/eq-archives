My 68 Enchanter has been languishing of late, due to World of Warcraft.
But I intend to come back to the fold sooner or later.

One thing that would speed my return is an increase in the Dire Charm
level cap.  I've been out of the loop since before DoN came out.  Has
there been any news, or even rumors, of an increase in the cap?
