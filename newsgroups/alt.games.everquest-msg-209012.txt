On a somewhat related note I was in Rathe mountains the other day and came
across a new (to me) named giant.
His name was Broog Bloodbeard and conned dark blue to a 56.

He really smacked about a 59 pally he surprised and he was forced to use LH,
but as far as I know he didnt drop anything exciting.
Anyone else seen this guy before ?
