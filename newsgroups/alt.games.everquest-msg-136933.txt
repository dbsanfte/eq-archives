A quick question from a novice druid that is somewhat on-topic for
this thread...

I'm a 15 wood-elf druid, and I decided to travel to Luclin for the
first time(this is my first character...told you I was a novice!).  I
went to the GF spires, got my shard, styaed very close to the Nexus,
and waited to be transported.

I was transported...back to the PoD lift at Kelethin.  It gave me a
message to the effect of "The zone to which you are traveling is down.
 You have been ported to a safe location."

Since I've never gone to Luclin, I just was curious if I had done
something wrong or if it really was just that Luclin was
closed/overcrowded/something.

Thanks in advance for any information!
