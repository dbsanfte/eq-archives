Definatly don't put points into Wis.
You are an Int caster not a wis caster.
I recommend that you restart your Char if you have done this.

I am unconvinced by either the importance of Cha or the difficulty of
raising cha vs Int. So are many others. I would take this advice with a
pinch of salt. I went for an Erudite and brought AGI STA and DEX up to
75 and then put the rest in INT, but then I am a bit odd. General advice
normally seems to be 5 in CHA rest in INT. I am sure that Sang can tell
us exactly what a high end enchanter would recommend.

Of course you will first need to buy your pet spell.
Luckily this should only cost a bit over 1gp.
The first level pet is OK, but be careful at level 3 taking on even
cons.

This would be great, at level 4 when you get tash, but at level 1 you
may as well pull with Shallow breath. ONLY take on even cons at level 1
and LOOT EVERYTHING. This way you should be able to afford your pet
spell and a few tiny daggers (about 1sp each). The Pet should then help
you earn enough money to buy some other spells. To be honest most of the
early spells suck quite hard in terms of soloing.

I would say that the spells you *need* from level 1 are :
Minor sheilding & Shallow breath (which you start with)
and
Pendril's Animation (Your pet spell)

The other first level spells won't actually help you reach level 4 as
far as I can see.
Strengthen and Weaken would help a bit, but strength plays only a very
small role in damage levels so these are not that hot.
Lull from my experiences as a cleric could be renamend "Train"
Minor Illusion is fun and used for training, but I can't see a real use
for it.
Reclaim energy is poinless.
Taper enchantment is almost as pointless considering it does not work on
poison or desiese dots and only rarely works on anything else.
Your other spell is true north. Nuff said.

Thus required expendeture on level 1 spells = 1gp
Not all that bad really


> 3. Cast your Damage over Time spell (DOT) I think it is Shallow Breath

Shallow Breath is a DD (Direct Damage) spell with a debuff attached (at
least that is what casters realm says.

You don't get Fear till level 4.
And you have to be able to afford it.

As far as I can see it is almost totally pointless to fear kite at level
4.
The level 4 pet is good enough to take out even cons on it's own, and is
frequently Yellow to you.

Soloing levels 1,2 and 3 is really just a case of beating on mobs.
At level 1 always pick white cons.
At levels 2,3 stick with blue and white cons.
Remember so long as you are in your respawn zone while hunting and you
take regular /locs that it is OK to take risks. You loose no xp on death
at this level. The only down side is the time take to get your body and
the time to rememorise spells. So you can afford to die quite a lot.

Cast Shallow breath frequently.
Always have your minor shield up.
Always keep a pet up if you have the spell and the daggers.
LOOT EVERYTHING.

At low levels there are a few things to look for in loot / cash:
1) Fire beetles : The eyes sell for 2sp 5cp, but don't stack. If you
kill lots you can soon buy a bag, then you can kill lots more.
2) Rusty weapons : This is normally as good as it gets from 1-4.
Sometimes worth more than a couple of gp. Cracked staff can go for
almost a pp.
3) Bags : Some mobs like goblins and kobolds carry bags and pouches.
These are great don't sell them use them to carry more loot.
4) Stackables : Bat wings and bone chips can be sold to players by the
stack (sometimes) if nothing else a stack of 1sp items sells for 2gp.

At level 4 let the pet do the hard work.
Try fear kiting if you like.
Remember to blur your pet as well as yourself.

Level 4 spells :

Color Flux : If you need to cast this it is probably too late
Enfeeblement : as this reduces AC it is probably worth it
Fear : Always good stuff
Gate : see above
Haze : AC buff nice, buy this
Illusion HEF / HUM : Not really required to get to level 8
Invis : Often usefull for scouting new areas, but beware the undead !
Juli's animation : New pet spell, and much better than the first one.
Mesmerise : You will be casting this for many levels to come. However
probably not the  most important spell to buy at 4th level. You will
want this by the time you are 8th mind, and make sure that your
Conguring is up to it.
Suffocating Sphere : Upgrade to Shallow Breath, Now you can do 10 points
of DD ! Worth getting.
Tashan : Annother spell that you will be casting for many levels to
come, but again not the most important spell at 4th level. Make sure you
have it before you go dungeon hunting.

I have to agree here.

This is generally true. (i.e. for most chars)

Also look for low level quests that you can do, like the Bard mail
quests. Check out :http://everquest.allakhazam.com/  look at Quests by
Zone and then check your home town and the surrounding zones. There may
be some nice easy quests for you there. (NOTE if you are on FV some may
have been disabled).

HTH,
