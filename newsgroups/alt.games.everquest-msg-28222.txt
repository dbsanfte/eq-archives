Consider anything that looks like a robe on- like a Crystal Covered
Shroud. That way it's only one piece, it covers everything, and still
looks like vestments. I'd put all your weapons away for the ceremony
(and make sure the pricipals involved have hired bodyguards for the
wedding party). If you have a book, like a testament of Vaneer, or a
Spirit Tome, you should have that in your hand.

As far as gifts go, anything appropriate to the couple is good. If I
work on my baking a little more, maybe I can bring the wedding cake.
