Sure it could be a scam, that's why I asked (assuming I do decide to get rid of
it) if there was a way for the person who gets it to tell if the keys had been
used or not. If there wasn't a way for them to tell, as I said above, I
wouldn't bother with it, and would either use it myself or let it collect dust.
And yeah, sending off money and waiting is pretty much the structure of every
online transaction. That's why using only trusted online merchants (or eBay,
which offers some buyer protection for "non-merchant" sales) is so important.
