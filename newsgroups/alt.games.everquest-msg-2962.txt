I must say that life after 30 becomes more tedious the higher one gets.  I
have a level 48 shaman that I only use to attend guild events, weddings,
etc.  The amount of time I have to spend farming xps is just not worth it at
the higher levels.  Raids aren't really that rewarding for the vast majority
of the participants, especially when you have the militant leader-types
commanding the participants to perform such anal tasks as "ALL CASTERS FACE
THE WALL".  There aren't that many quests at higher levels, there are almost
no new skills until level 51, and most spells are just upgrades of spells I
already have.

Indeed, I would suggest that you are missing out by only playing one
character.  All you know is where that one character has been.  There are
some interesting zones that you probably only run through.  So, to each his
own.  Everyone will have their own version of fun.
