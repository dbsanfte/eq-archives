I've never seen a hate raid posted that didn't include the demand
that everyone bring peridots for themselves.  Carrying a few stacks
of them would simplify things for people, who could instead
-buy- them off you, if cash is a concern.

Frankly, at this point I shrug off any attempts to reimburse me
for peridot usage.  They only cost 10pp each, I have a backpack
full of them and know where to buy more.  Either loot is so good
that the hundred or two pp I spend for an evening  is trivial, or
its so bad that I hate to think of the poorer classes shelling out
for the priviledge of having grouped with me.

On a plane raid, though, I guess you would go thru pretty
serious cash if you weren't given stacks of rocks... since you
should buff -everyone- and will be reapplying symbol
frequently on the people who have died, plus the raids tend
to run very long, so you'll go thru several cycles worth of
rocks.
