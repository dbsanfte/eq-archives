Mid 30s, somewhere around there, I honestly don't recall exactly.  You have
to get lucky, they can range from 33 to 37 or so in level.  It was iffy at
that time, they broke root a lot, and DoTs were not as effective with root
off back then.  I think when I first started, I got one out of four of them
soloing.  The others I had to zone.
