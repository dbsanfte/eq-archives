Paladin 'nerf' removed now.

"SLAY UNDEAD NOT CHANGING, OCTOBER 19, 2002    Source: Paladins of Norrath.

Over the last day, we've received a great deal of feedback and concern 
over the proposed Slay Undead change. We've put a lot of thought into 
the issue, and decided to hold off making any changes to Slay Undead for 
the foreseeable future.

Slay Undead will continue to work in exactly the same way, and deal the 
same damage it does on live servers currently, and remain at that 
balance through level 65. Damage caused by Slay Undead won't increase 
post-60, though Paladin melee damage in general will continue to rise as 
you level up. There will be no defense penalty imposed while using this 
skill.

We'd like to apologize for any undue frustration this has caused you, 
and we appreciate the feedback that was sent in. This change was 
well-intentioned, but we realized we were focusing too much on the 
potential of the top 5% of Paladins, and while the solution was 
reasonable for that sub-group, it wasn't appropriate to apply across the 
board.

Thanks for your patience,

Rich Waters
Lead Designer, EverQuest"
