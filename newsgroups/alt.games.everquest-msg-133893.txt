No real ideas, and only a slightly similar problem.
I posed here but got no responce.

I was getting situational lag when looting or tradeing (PC or Merchant)
I found that doing global /who cleared the lag.

I have also seen some posts on the sony dev boards saying that doing a
/say can clear some situational lag.

sorry not much help.
