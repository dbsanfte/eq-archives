The issue is posting, not reading.  The news server is used for reading, and
SMTP server is used for posting in Free Agent.  Here, we use a Microsoft
exchange server for email.  I admit to being clueless when it comes to this,
but I don't know what I should enter for the SMTP server in Free Agent, or
presumably, any other newsreader that I try to install.  In OE, it is setup
to use the Microsoft exchange server for email.  I don't see such an option
in Free Agent, and I don't plan on blindly downloading all sorts of free
newsreaders until I find one that will work with MS Exchange.  So, I ask
once again, anyone know of a good free newsserver that will work with MS
Exchange server for POSTING to newsgroups?  Or, how I would go about setting
up, say, Free Agent to work with an MS Exchange server for POSTING.
