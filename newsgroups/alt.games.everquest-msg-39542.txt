Some merchants are on different faction than the local "Merchants of
xxxxxx."  Ton Firepride in South Qeynos is an example of that.... what is
he?  Circle of Unseen Hands, or Bloodsabers?

Another example is the merchant upstairs from the Bank in Halas.  She is on
the Rogues of the White Rose faction, not Merchants of Halas.  Also, the
weapons salesman outside of the Pit of Doom in Halas is Wolves of the North
faction, not merchant faction.

I do wonder though... if it is possible for a merchant to be part of two
factions at the same time... both the local merchants faction, and also of
some other guild or temple in the town...?
