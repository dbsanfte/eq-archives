The point is that Verant does not realize that people *will* think
like this, because that is what they seem to be tuning the (high end)
game to be about. People'll want to kill the stuff put in game,
they'll want to do it fast and they'll want to do it without lagging
out. So, the slow assist healers won't cut it.
