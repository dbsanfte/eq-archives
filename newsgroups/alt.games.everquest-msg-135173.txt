Hehe. After booting up Windows, I loaded up Everquest, and less than two 
minutes later I was playing. One of my flatmates had already patched his 
EQ so it was all sitting in the proxy for me when my eqclient requested 
the files.

After posting about this setup yesterday, and the possibility that 
setting your proxy settings manually in IE might make the eqclient 
patcher use them, it occured to me that a lot more people could benefit 
from this than I initially thought.

Most ISPs these days transparently proxy HTTP traffic to improve speed 
and save bandwidth. Most ISPs will give you their proxy settings should 
you choose to set your proxy manually. Therefore if you are on the same 
ISP as a bunch of your friends you could all set your proxy settings in 
IE before patching. Once one person has completed the patching download 
the rest of them will retrieve the patches from the ISP's proxy, 
resulting in a much faster patching experience. However, this is still 
limited by the bandwidth between you and your ISP.

This of course all depends on whether the eqclient patcher does use the 
proxy settings as defined in IE.
