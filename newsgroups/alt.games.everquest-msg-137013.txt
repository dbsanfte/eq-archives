[Top post fixed]

When you buy it and install it, the CD's will come with an account key.
You will use that to register your account online. The first 30 days are
free, but you will need a credit card, or appropriate Sony Game Card to
pay the fee and register to begin playing.

Who you play "against" isn't really a valid question. There are a few
PvP (Player vs. Player) servers. You can choose from over forty servers
to make your first characters on. (You can play on them all if you
like.) If you choose a PvP server (they all have the word "Zek" in their
names) you will be in an environment where you can attack and kill other
players, and they in turn can attack and kill you. 

But that's the minority in the extreme. The majority of the servers are
PvE (Player vs. Environment) where you don't fight other players unless
it's in a designated PvP arena or in a duel you both agree to.

How long does it take? How long will you live? :-)

There are currently sixty levels in the game. To get one character to
level sixty (assuming you make it) could take under a year if you are a
maniac or a couple years if you are more casual. The last five levels
require insane amounts of time, hunting, working with guilds, etc. to
finish.

Oh, and be warned. In terms of addictiveness, EverCrack makes heroin
look like baby food.
