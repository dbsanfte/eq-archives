>Is it possible to start as a Shaman in Qeynos - 

No.

>If so, what race would I be?

To start in qeynos is impossible for a shaman, so the race question is
moot.

>I've tried creating several characters as Shaman, but none seem to start in
>Qeynos, which is where I want to be ..

Only humans and half elves can start in qeynos. And only some of them.

Your next best bet is a barbarian shaman who starts in halas. It isn't much
of a trip, and everfrost is a far superior newbie ground to the qeynos lawn
anyway.
