The chance of getting a skillup while tradeskilling is related to the 
higher of your int or wis (or sometimes, like for smithing, the highest of 
int, wis, str.  But always int, wis and an optional something).  Your wis 
is much higher than your int, so your int will have exactly no effect 
whatsoever on your ability to tradeskill.  You're a cleric.  Just don't 
even worry about int.  Ever. :)
