What a tale!  And congrats for perservering!  It's stories like this that
make me really happy I've joined the game.  I only wish I did it sooner.

And a while back at Kurn's a toon was buying bone chips at 1pp per.
Kentigern made quite a bit of money (to me, anyway) selling them off.  I
wonder if that guy was doing the same faction quest?  Hmmm...

I've been playing for about six months now and, fairly often, run into
people that have just started the game as well.  EverQuest is a far from
dead game no matter what the nay-sayers say.
