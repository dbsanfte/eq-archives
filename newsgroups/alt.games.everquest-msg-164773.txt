Perhaps it is time to consider what the world would have been like if
the US had collapsed and the USSR had become the only Super Power in
the world today. Im pretty sure we would not be ABLE to even have this
debate. 
My point is even though the actions of the US have been less than
ideal they are a far cry from what could have been. OTOH there is
always the possibility of Pax Americana being enforced on the world at
some future date. My hope is that this never becomes a reality but a
couple more 9/11s and all bets will be off. Odd thing is the only way
there could have been an Islamic revolution in many of the Middle
Eastern countries (Iran being the exception) is the fall of the USSR
leaving them free of the cold war tussle as it had been. 
This is why we should always vote against the government of the US
becoming more powerful than it is already. Socialism in all its forms
has a way of expanding with tanks rather than the old capitalist
method of buying the country. Both allow looting it six ways from
sunday, but one is rather more deadly than the other.
