The monk, hands down. My well equipped monk was out-taunting a well 
equipped warrior four levels his senior last night. With a slow weapon, 
too.

It's common knowledge. Anyone can tell you. Warriors don't solo well for a 
reason. Toe to toe, a monk will drop a mob in almost half the time it takes 
a warrior, IME. Then again, toe to toe the monk will take one and a half 
times more damage, which sucks since he already has less hit points than 
his warrior friend.
