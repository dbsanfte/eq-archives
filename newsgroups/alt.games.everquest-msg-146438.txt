You could try downloading windows debugger from
http://oca.microsoft.com/en/ and if you've a lot of disk space (1.1 GB
installed), xp debugger symbols.
Set your error reporting (default enabled) from small to complete in
my computer/properties/advanced, and on the next dump, use windbg's 
!analyse -v command for an analysis.
I'm currently resolving an IRQ issue on the house server - an abit
tx-5 (which doesn't support ACPI) with pci-slot switches - I was
having 2-3 hourly crashes (annoying for losing your place in p2p
queues).
Hope this helps.
Good hunting.
