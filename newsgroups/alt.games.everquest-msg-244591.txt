From Day 1 for me in-game (that's March 2001) my characters have been on
Cazic Thule.  Started there because of a person I met on a.g.e. who has
since gone on the other pastures.  I'm a member of two guilds there ... one
that's doing a bit of raiding, one that's a raiding wannabe.  I haven't
spent much time with either lately, as I've been a bit burned out on the
game.  I still frequent their boards, and have friends in both.  But the
game itself is a bit soured on me at the moment.

In a effort to determine if my problem is EQ burnout or EQ environment
burnout, I started a brand spanking new kitten on The Tribunal with the
mindset of getting into grouping early.  That way I could determine if it's
the EQ process or the familiarity of the people/politics on CT that's
wearing thin.

Problem is ... I can't find a group.

Going places that are level appropriate, I find that they're either
completely empty or cleaned out by someone PLing.  That's fine and dandy ...
I know how it goes.  No sweat.  I was planning to find a guild at some point
anyway, I'll just do it sooner than I had wanted to.

Problem is ... I can't find a guild.

I sat my kitten in the PoK one evening and just listened to the chatter,
doing the occasional "/w all <guildname>" of folks who seemed to be helpful,
funny, or otherwise well received when they announced themselves.  I found a
whole lot of lvl 65 folks in guilds, and a few lower levels mixed in with
the 65's (I assume they were alts), but not many in any neighborhood a lvl
11 shammy can run in.

So today at lunch I posted on the Tribunal's EZBoard, asking if anyone knew
of a family/relaxed/non-raiding guild that might be interested in a veteran
player with a new character.  Basically I was told by a couple of folks
"Good luck, but you're probably not going to find it.  We don't start
grouping around here until 45-50+."  They weren't impolite at all, but it
does beg the question ... are there any non-raiding guilds on this server?

Or should I just give up the hunt.  Come to the realization that my goals
(to have fun and relax for an hour or two before bedtime) no longer coexist
with the goals of the majority of the current EQ playerbase.  If so, that's
groovy.  I'd kind of hate it because the game is a fun diversion from
husband/daddy thing, but I'd rather give it up than let it become another
stressor.

Opinions, anyone? :-)
