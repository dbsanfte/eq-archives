Bah - more unpronouncable zones that you can't get a group in unless you're
elemental.  I'm still pissed about the GoD zones and the lack of groups
there.  Seems I need to go give up my life, sacrifice my left nut, join a
quasi-uber guild, spend 6 hours a night, 5 nights a week getting flagged
just so I can move out of PoP.
