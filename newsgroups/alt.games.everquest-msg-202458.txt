I am very sad if this is true and ask you to look at the issue from my
circumstances.  I'm an older player who doesn't nearly get the time to play it
seems that many do.  I've been playing almost since the beginning and my
highest level character is 43.  I quit for about a year because although I love
the game, I just could not log on and med for 12 minutes, look around for a
mob, nuke him, and then sit back down to med again.  It just moves too damn
slow.  I've heard all the arguments about mana conservation and I know how to
play my character to use as little mana as possible.  I played through all the
spellbook staring days and leveled all my characters before there was a Paldual
Caverns that would take you to 25 in two days.  I like having KEI now.  I even
got a friend to come back to play because he likes playing a cleric but didn't
like sitting around medding all day.  Now we duo with a cleric and a pally and
we have a blast.  We're not Uber.  We don't run around causing trouble or
shouting or spamming zones.  We don't wanna be able to dominate the game.  We
just don't want to sit on our butts staring at each other.  That's boring. 
It's that simple.  I can't imagine why anyone would be happy that the two of us
are gonna be bored now.  You play your game and I'll play mine.  You don't like
KEI, don't get one.  Find friends who don't like it either and you all can run
around feeling superior to everyone else.  Me and my buddy, we just want to
have some fun.  Too bad you guys are so happy to see them have us go back to
sitting on our butts.
