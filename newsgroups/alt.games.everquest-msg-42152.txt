Hate and Air are two zones... your comments below make it clear that
you don't think one or two zones out of hundreds makes enough of
a difference to change a rating.  SOW Potions and T/Jboots are also
add on items that every class can get, not supposed to drastically influence
ratings I thought.  SOW potions you can run out of, TBoots and JBoots
are slower than SOW, and in either case they aren't on you if you are
dead and naked, while the druid can always cast it in any outdoor
zone... even if you are going indoors you can get SOW before you
go in, to make the break in at least safer.

Oh, I agree, they certainly aren't a ten.. But I'd put them over a cleric,
warrior,
paladin, or mage at this.  Quibbling between a one, two, or three, here, I just
can't see why you'd put them all the way down at one.

You say "unless you are in an outdoor dungeon" as though half the game
doesn't take place outdoors.  Heck, often outdoors the wizard doesn't
even have to leave the group to pull

Yes, I acknowledged that as part of your definition.  But the
"etc" part means you don't mean single pull as the sole defining
feature of pulling.  With a good enchanter in the group,
grabbing several mobs at once (as long as you didn't DOT
em to do it) works pretty well too,

Sebelis, Howling Stones, Kael Drakkar, Temple of Veeshan, The Hole,
Hate, Fear, POG... I'm sure there are more.  Not all these zones are
impossible to walk out of, but many are sufficiently inconvenient that
most groups would much rather port out than fight their way out.  Course
I'm sure if everyone in the group is 60th this factor looms less large, but
I really doubt its ever down to just one zone.  Even when you get out
of the zone, you still face a long walk back to a vendor if you want
to sell junk and split the cash, or to formup spots for your next group,
without that porter.  Danger isn't the only reason most groups I'm
in see a porter of one flavor or the other as a "must have."  You need
to get there and to get back without spending hours crossing the world.

Not all... or at least not by much.  Mage pets sponge best, necro
pets second, chanter pets a -distant- third... I've been in mid fifties
groups with no nominal tank at all, using the mage pet as sponge
while a ranger served as taunter for robe protection.  I really would
reconsider cutting the pet out of your strategic thinking here, the
mage in many cases -is- the pet, its not an afterthought like the SK
and shaman pets... or even an equal partner like the necro pet. I"d
put a mage pet on a par with a paladin for damage soaking capability,
and you aren't going to see that mage pet without the mage in your
group.

Sure, but you aren't going to have the necro go buy malachites... so
thats a non-issue.  Mages generally have access to easy malachite
sources all over the world.  Malachite stacks, is light and cheap,
there's no reason not to travel around with a hundred pets worth
of rocks.  Relying on other people to get your components for you?
I thought you put that off limits below, responding to my (facecious)
comment that clerics have relatively unfettered access to free ports.

Monk and/or necro holds em off while everyone else leggs it for the
zone line, then the mage zones back in and plucks the FD'd hero's
right out of their trouble spots.

For that matter, COH the puller before he even gets back with the
mispull, he can run it off in another direction for the twelve interminable
second it takes to go off.

Pulling with your lowest damage spell is the trick here... you aren't out
to do damage, you just want em to follow you.  Burst of Flame is a pretty
good one for this, costs almost no mana, and the aggro it generates is
really easy to overcome.  Mages, unlike Wizards, can afford the mana
(well, really the lost mana from not medding) since their principle means
of doing damage is their pet, not their nukes; I've happily (admittedly a
much lower level mage here, no more than 28) pulled one in, set the pet
on it, and run off to find the next pull, which I could deliver right after
the last one died.  Always full mana in case of a disaster, still doing
plenty of damage, -minimal- down time.

OK, well, I'm forced to agree, but so many people swear by this and

The necro does not pay for this, each dead person does.  Thats 175 pp per
death.  Trivial at my lofty 52nd level perch, haven't been anywhere recently
that didn't see me getting five times that in loot on average.  Also, I try not
to die in places where a massive CR would be needed... like to die from
stupid stuff like going AFK and getting trained with Slate.

Naturally, a bank run or more likely a Neriak run...  unless you are in

I can't imagine why.  Are they failing to buff themselves up?  Priority:
Enchanter,
cleric, warrior, everyone else.  Peridot are trivial cost to me though, perhaps
your constantly broke level 60s are trying to save 10pp a whack.  I've got
a good channelling, and have for ages purposefully pulled stuff off people,
backed away with it slamming me, and rooted thru the pain.  Move back
off, celestial, and go back to paying attention to the main fight.  Only
difficulty
is preventing people from panicking when the realize that the cleric is getting
hit...people I have more HP than anyone but the warrior, more AC than
half the party (including the ranger) and can by Brell's Empty Mug take
at least a -bit- of a beating.

Hmm, I suppose it is, but it still also sounds like damage absorption to me,
taking a few 761 point slaps in the face instead of the warrior really lightens
the load a bit.

OK, thats fair, I was half joking anyway... but I still say there aren't many
non porters who have an easier time getting a port than clerics.  Maybe
chanters.

Hey now, that last part is unfair, just because most clerics don't work on
melee doesn't mean that the class is lacking here.  I had both offense and
2hb capped every level, and know how to meditate between swings so
as to not lose any mana regeneration (trick is to use a big slow stick...which
is ok since there is no damage bonus for non melee's anyway)  I'm not
kidding here, using a Runewood, I literally did more damage per minute
than almost every paladin I grouped with up till I hit 44.  At that point my
2hb capped out, mobs started getting harder to hit, Paladins damage started
climbing rapidly away from me.  Oh, Dual Weild doesn't factor in if you
are using a two hander, so the only other -sucks- part is the lack of double
attack...

Up past 50 I really haven't seen people taking "tank" instead of "warrior" unless

pressed.  Yes, you -can- use a SK or Paladin, for that matter you -can- use
a necro or bard for mez... but we aren't talking possible, we are talking what
most people think is necessary.

No I don't, but I'd love to have you explain your viewpoint here.  I've
resed 23 people in 20 minutes, and half that time was due to people
not being responsive when I gave them a "ready" tell.  Stick could have
cut that to perhaps 10 minutes... but the thing is, this is only important
when your raid is wiped out, which isn't exactly something we should
be planning on.

Hmm, I"ve grouped with 60 and 59 warriors, never noticed the difference,

Whats the point of crowd control if you are taking the damage?  You might
as well be sucking up that damage but hurting the main mob, just do the math:

Lets take a very simple situation, two mobs, each with 9K hp, and two
people who can do 4500 hp a minute

Your version of crowd control: each guy takes one mob and works on
it for two minutes while sucking up all the damage it can do.

Normal no crowd controller tactics, everyone on one mob till it dies: one
mob dies in the first minute, the other falls a minute later... but instead
of two mobs doing damage for two minutes (thats four mob/minutes
of damage) you have one doing damage for only one minute, the other
for two... thats three mob/minutes!

With my version of crowd control, that one mob dies in the first minute while
the other is forced to do nothing at all, then the second goes down at the
end of the second minute.  Thats two mob/minutes... half what your "controlled"
mobs did.

Of course if you were fear kiting the mobs, then neither would do any damage
at all while being killed... same with root kiting or snare kiting or... well,
kiting
sure does save a lot of healing any way you look at it.

Mez is crowd control, root is crowd control, heck, stun, fear, blind and
certainly
charm are crowd control.... but taking a mob aside and letting it beat on you
is only aggro control.

Not just efficiency, possibility.  And on anyone but the tanks, possibility
not of CHeal, but of remedy (read divine light or whatever it is that higher
level clerics throw at people they don't want to die while they wait for
crowd control to kick in)

If you are going to consider the DW helm, then you have to allow for thurgadin
legs on the cleric, who can then chain group heal, much more effective than
the wimpy DW "heal" approach.  Further, one of the best group heals
in the game for mana effficiency is Heroic Bond... over 7 hp per mana
spent, but that means everyone has heroism up and can't get hat healed.

Additionally, I"ve noticed that paladins are generally lower on mana than
clerics in a normal fast pull situation... especially with my legs running
constant
heals like an out of control bard, I'm not using mana much unless something
goes wrong.

Again, downtime reduction, not healing.  Your HP bar starts going south in
a big way and there's not one thing the bard can do for you.  Yes, if the
mob gets back off of you then you'll get back up to fully healed before the
fight ends... but you said earlier that ending a fight at anywhere more than
zero hp is "enough"... bards can't help you not hit zero, all they can do is
help you end the fight with a lot more than zero if you have anything.

Your shaman counts as a healer because his regrowth and slow tactics
can bring damage down to where SHeals and GHeals are viable spells...
the bard has nothing comperable to throw in when and as needed.

I figured that was what you meant, so this was a cheap shot... but it
is a drawback to the bard; pet heavy group tactics pretty much take
the bard out of the buff business.  Luckily bards are very mutable,
they can happily -not- concentrate their efforts  on buffing and instead
stick with debuffing, mana regen, mezing... maybe charming... well
the list goes on to such an extent that not being effective buffers
in this instance is hardly a concern.
