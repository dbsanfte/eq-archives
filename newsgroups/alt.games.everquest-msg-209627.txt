And how many npcs would you need to adjust to do that?  Town guards are
generally unique NPC's with separate names.  There aren't 100 "an Iksar
guard"s.... there are Crusader Xyskalyawhatever and Captain
Slaksayougettheidea.  There are probably stored as hundreds of separate
types.  So they can either go through those several hundred mobs and change
the exp value one by one, or they could change one number and hit the entire
zone at once.   Which sounds more efficient to you?   (It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to figure it out.)
