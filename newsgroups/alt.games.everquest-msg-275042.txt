my experiences are quite the opposite: I don't have the luxury of being albe
to game for hours and hours everyday. usually I log on for an hour or two,
but still I manage to group and advance just fine. as I said earlier,
joining a guild might help if people have difficulties grouping.

also: many people seem to think eq2 as totally un-soloable game. that just
isn't the case. there's a s**tload of quests you can do without a group.
