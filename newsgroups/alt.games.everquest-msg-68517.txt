Just

Is EQW considered evil?  When it first came to a.g.e's attention earlier
this year I don't recall any flack from most of the regulars (I'm sure DT
had horrible things to say about it though).  I'd never use ShowEQ or that
stupid macro program because they give unfair advantages over those who
don't/can't, but all EQW does is give you limited access to your computer.
The version I used also gave FPS which was cool.

It was also buggy as all hell.  I wish him well but I have no intention of
trying it again unless I lose 2 of my 3 computers. :)

When Eq Caster wrote "play at your own risk" I read it as "since it might
crash EQ," NOT "'cause you might be banned for it."  I could be wrong
though.
