But, like I said, they didn't go down until evening. Most of that
downtime was overnight. True, the crash occurred during prime time
hours, but to say they were down "all day" is hugely misleading.

A note, they are doing a 24 hour maintenance on the trouble servers,
and offering a *5 day* free time compensation for that. Of course,
some people are bitching that it's not enough. They seem confident
that they've found something that'll help the problems, though.
