I never suggested he had attempted all options, or that he was out of 
options, but a lawsuit is nontrivial, and potentially costly. Personally 
I think if he got it going it would even suceed; GOM has it in writing 
that he's keeping the plat to punish them... he's going to be hard 
pressed to convince a real judge that the pp delivery was never made.

All I said was SOE and Paypal have both emphatically declared in advance 
that they don't support what he's doing... he should have been prepared 
for this inevitability... because it was inevitable.

Not quite, the EULA is plenty strong enough that should he phone Sony 
and say "Hi, I tried to sell pp to some player, and he didn't pay up..." 
SOE can, and will, simply point the EULA, and say we don't support that 
sort of transaction, you are on your own. If he wants to push the issue 
he can level a suit at Sony... but the point is: Sony has pretty much 
covered its ass with the EULA in terms of setting the expectation of the 
level of support they will provide him with this 'crisis'.
