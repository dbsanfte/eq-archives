On Morel Thule, Rathe was behaving as you say, well, better, never
heard any fussing about KSing at all.  Lots of people were very
helpful in sharing information as to whic mobs were dropping
what loot, which mobs had what kind of resists, anything we could
think of to help each other out.

Then I went over to EK, to find people ridiculing simple questions
like "any druid drops?," and lying about item locations (its one
thing to decide to let stuff rot rather than /ooc it, another to
deliberately tease people trying to make use of the odd trinkets
on the ground) and generally being rude.

On the other hand, some of the most fun I've had IG recently came
from the Cursed Beholders; they have a force shock effect that
sends you flying!  Get one up on the mountaintop and when he
goes off he'll send you all the way down to the farm.  Course its
a 10Khp fall when you hit bottom, but whats a 90% res good for
if not for this?  Worth it!  Had over 10 people try it out, with the
beholder rooted down on top of the mountain.
