The procs on the Exe Axe and Earthen Blade are both "Haste" .. Which will
NOT stack with Haste items, but *might* stack with haste spells.

IIRC, you can only have two Haste effects on at once. One from item, one
from spell. Bard songs count towards the spell limit. Even the uber quest
eyepatch from Velious won't stack with any player-cast Haste spell, but WILL
stack with Haste items.
