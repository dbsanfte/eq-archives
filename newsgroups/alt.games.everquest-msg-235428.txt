It's just another "revenue opportunity".  That is to say that, according
to the server message you get when you log in, it is open to transfers.
I'm sure SOE is hoping, er, um, I mean concerned that perhaps it could

$75+ per account, iirc).  Anybody wanting to try a "newbie server" need
not bother getting their hopes up.
