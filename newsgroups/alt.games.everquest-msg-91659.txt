And you did not imply the exact opisite? BTW, I read their boards too and often post
there. The only threads that I notice that where being deleted were the ones I
describe. While, I admit there may have been one that started out as you said, a
majority of the ones that were deleted were deleted after they turned into a "you
fubbing lie" post.

Just because a thread starts out rational does not mean it will stay that way. And if
it does not stay rational, should it be allowed to stay in a location that is designed
to answer the questions of new players? How can what was being discussed assisting
NEWBIEs in playing the game? There is a time and a place for people to complain. There
are location given for people to go complain. The Newbie Zone Boards is not the place.
While trying to assist new players in the game is not the time. You do not go to a
funeral to complain about the way that person treated people in real life, do you? No,
because a funeral is not the time and place for that type of complaint.
