Hate: needs a component to port into (bought in Neriak Cleric guild),
easy-ish mobs but break can still be challenging.  Probably easier than
Fear but, really not recommended either.

Fear:  Free to get into but...mmm...no.  Possible corpse rot even now if
you get freaky aggro on zone in.

Growth: Possible if it weren't for the fact that it will trash faction most
of the group would probably want to keep.  If they don't mind then this is
the place where you could conceivably kill mobs.
