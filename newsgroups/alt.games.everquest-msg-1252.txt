I have read about five replies and can't handle any more
misinformation, so if I'm repeating, excuse me.  I'm no expert here
since I've never played a rogue, but here are the basic facts.

Sneak and hide are skills.  Hide is more effective but, obviously, you
can't move around.  Bard gets sneak and hide but the skill caps are so
low that it is almost useless after some early level.  I think the cap
for bards is like 40 or something.  Ranger cap is under 100, monk cap
is just over 100, rogue cap is at least 200.  (Also some races get hide
and sneak but skill cap for race-determined hide/sneak is like 1 or
something.)  Because of the cap, and because the real need for it only
occurs at very high levels, it pretty much becomes a rogue-only talent,
like lockpicking.  In addition, afaik, only rogues get a fail message
when it doesn't work.

This is not to say that monks (or even rangers and bards) can't use it
effectively at some levels, just that it is temporary skill that is
going to become ineffective at higher levels.

Rogue sneak is generally the most effective means of moving invisible
in the game and in some cases the ONLY effective means of moving
invisible.  It is a godsend in Hate where a rogue can pretty much move
through the whole zone unmolested for CR (although not in Fear, where
scarelings see through it from a long way off;  a rogue running around
is risking a VERY hard CR).  It is better than bard invis song and much
better than invis, itu, camouflage line, etc.  By "better" I mean, at
skill 180+, 1) it works against both live and dead, 2) it is more
reliable, 3) it works against many mobs that will see through any other
invisibility spell.  For example, revultant rats, who sometimes see
through invis and sometimes don't, never see through rogue sneak.

Three clear limitations on its usefulness are 1) it cannot be cast on
others, 2) it is a skill with reset time, and 3) rate of movement
decreases enormously.

What it DOES do is enables a raid to have a super-scout and super
corpse puller.  As long as you have a cleric camped and a live rogue,
the raid is not going to turn into a disasterous CR debacle.
