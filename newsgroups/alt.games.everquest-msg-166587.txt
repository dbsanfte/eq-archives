Given that shamans can make potions for a variety of spells that they can't
cast ever, I won't entirely agree with the reasoning you put behind this.
As for the Blood of Wolf potions, without fails, they cost 52.5pp for a 10
charge.  So, counting a 5% fail rate, that's about 55pp.  Used to sell
regularly for 100pp, with the bazaar, on EMarr, about 85pp, still not a bad
profit.  The potions that I sell the most of by far in the bazaar are SoW
and DS potions.  Invis to Undead sometimes sells, Shrink rarely sells now.
I have not attempted any of the high end ones yet, as my alchemy has lagged
behind a lot, at 101 now.
