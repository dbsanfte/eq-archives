Only those who see it as entertainment have a problem.

I don't see that at all. I see the story being covered because people 
want to know about it, not because people want to celebrate it or watch 
it like a train wreck.

I guess I'm just used to my small mid-western market. It would more often 
be covered here because of a lack of enough else to fill the time slot.

Of course I question the line of questions offered any famous actor, 
athlete or otherwise notable person in many cases. Though shallow, it 
does not all stem from the macabre.

That's quite the callous picture you paint there, and not the way I'm 
familiar with it happening. Like I said though, in my television market 
sensationalism might not be such a necessity.
