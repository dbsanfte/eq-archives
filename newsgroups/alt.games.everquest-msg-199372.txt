To clarify, 1) 85% rule does work in solro's chamber.
2) Ok this part is weird.   My girlf needed dreso to complete the 5 minis,
but she already had her solro flag.

Once she got the dreso flag, the drake outside pof and the seer made no
mention of the minis (which is needed to turn the 5 mini flags into a
soluselro portal flag).

There was no talk of dressos ___ whatever running through her, or the text
of the other 4 that me, my shaman etc got..

The minute she got solros flag, the seer reported 100% identical info to my
monks (i was botting her for dresso, so its not hearsay about the seer... I
had the 2 screens side by side to compare every line.  I haven't found a way
to explain yet how you could still need minis after you get his flag.
