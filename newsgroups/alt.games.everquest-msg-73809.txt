Magic is supposed to be rare and powerful. Powerful is relative. When
you are surrounded by being capable of Sow and levitation and AOE
nukes Gandalf looks weak. When you aren't surrounded by magic (magic
is rare in the world of the Ring) then the ability to stop a balrog,
call a giant eagle for transport, know things or find out where to
look for answers, speak various tongues, etc is all very powerful. 

If LoTR was played out with EQ characters galdalf would have ported
them all to mordor and Frodo the Drood would have sowed them all and
run them up to Mt. Doom and levitated them over the lava to drop the
ring in. The Epic Quest would have lasted all of a day.

I sure wish Sierra had let the original team finish the LoTR mmorpg.
It may have been a failure but it sure would have been different. Rare
magic use, limited numbers of players who could be elves, the ability
to bind and kidnap people, permadeath. Would have been a neat world to
explore.
