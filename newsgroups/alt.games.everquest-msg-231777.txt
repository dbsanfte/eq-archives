I *did* say I only have 8 people on my ignore list.  Obviously you have to do
something really awful to end up on it.  
And I can honestly say I'm pretty patient with people but ... ok, example:
There are a brother and sister who are both on my list.  I get invited into my
*first* Pop zone group.  I get there, the brother is afk.  Was afk 20 minutes
of the 30 minutes he was in our group.  Then he said he had to log off so his
sister could play, and would we let her in the group?  Group Leader says yes. 
Sis shows up, OOM, has to med up she says.  She sits down and doesn't move for
the next 15 minutes or so.  We go ahead and pull a few, the Group Leader
finally says in /g are you playing or not?  *SHE'S* afk.  He promptly disbands
her.  When she DOES get back to the keyboard 20 minutes later she starts
/OOCing the zone because we'd replaced her and she'd run all the way out there
to be in the group.  Wahhhhhh......
Hey, I understand chores and kids and all that real life stuff.   If *real
life* is your priority ATM then it IS.  It's ok, its fine, we understand, but
we're not going to drag you along out of the goodness of our hearts, we need
players who are playing, not giving the kids a bath or out mowing the lawn.  
End of rant...
