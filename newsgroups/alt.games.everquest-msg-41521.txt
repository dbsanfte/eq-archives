Afghanistan is controlled by the Taliban, a god forsaken bunch of fanatics
who are hated by the rest of the Islamic world. Although all the recent
(past 20 years) plane hijacks and subsequent deaths/atrocities have been
committed by terrorists under the banner of fighting for Islam it is not the
view held by the majority of the Islamic world so IMHO the neighbouring
Islamic states will not escalate conflicts by joining Afghanistan.

Pakistan has a vested interest in Afghanistan and it is Pakistan who has
been funding the Taliban and providing weapons and training but although
they have a small nuclear capability they would not be so stupid as to do
anything other than make the usual complaining noises as any involvement
would give India an excuse to "reclaim borders".

Russia also has interest in Afghanistan since they lost the territory to the
Mujahadeen (Sp?) who ousted Russian presence and have since continued to
fight against the Taliban. This is the current civil war in Afghanistan.

Palestine would be the most likely country to want to involve themselves as
they hate the Americans and British for forcing the surrender of land which
they believe is theirs to become Israel whose people believe the land is
theirs. Both these beliefs of land ownership stem from their GOD saying so
(sheesh). America has continued to fund Israel in their acts against
Palestine as Israel is sort of a democracy (people can vote providing they
vote how the government wants them to vote, but at least they can vote).

Libya is too far away to make any impact and does not have the military
strength to do anything.

Iraq is hated by its neighbours, especially so by Iran so would be foolish
to involve themselves but Saddam Hussein is not a sane man and will use any
attack by coalition forces on Afghanistan as another call to the Jihad (Holy
War quoted by all Islamic extremists to justify their actions) and could
well offer military support or even ride on the back of it for another
attack towards Kuwait.

If the Islamic countries of the middle east wanted to involve themselves the
only real option open to them is to close their airspace and in so doing so
make it very difficult for strategic bombings and the launch of cruise.

World War III would be between America, Europe, Russia and China as these
are the superpowers capable of global scale conflict. Russia and China would
not react to any military action against Afghanistan as it is in no way to
their gain or interest.

I truly believe the escalating rise of fundamentalism in Islam and the
rewriting of religious texts to justify themselves is the only real true
threat to world peace. I have no doubts in my own mind that Afghanistan in
its association with Osama Lin Baden is responsible for the recent
atrocities and cannot in any way allow them selves to sit back and wait
whilst the world shouts for retribution. I think that President Bush faces a
very difficult time over the next few days but must and will come to a
decision to strike hard and fast now.

Fact for the day: Afghanistan produces 70% of the worlds heroin grade opium.
The trade is controlled by the Taliban and funds their cause. This is in
direct contradiction to their own edict that any substance of this nature
from Alcohol to Heroin is totally against Islam and any Muslim found to be
involved in these substances is immediately put to death.

I am an Atheist and do not support any religious beliefs nor take sides with
any Middle Eastern policies. Long live America, its people and for the
freedom for which they stand. As a Britain, an Englishman I will support
America in any fight against the evil that stems from the corruption of
humanity that festers within these Hell on Earth countries.
