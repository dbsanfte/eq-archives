The fix was short sighted as it did not address the core issue. The
resultant they "fixed" by drastically lowering the sell back price can be
taken further in producing a slew of other goods which have not been fixed.
The only way to fix this particular problem for good is by addressing the
price of the core component.

If sans macro it is legit then it would be a good way to get a leg up on a
fresh server with a baby character, otherwise a level 50+ could just about
make equal money farming trade skill items. It is only once it is macroed
that this really becomes a major problem - bloody macroers wreck tradeskills
for honest folk.

I just bugged it - I didn't petition it though.
