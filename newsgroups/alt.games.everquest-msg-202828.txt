What circumstances?  Your dieing and have 10 mins to live, you can't bear to
waste 5 of them by medding?

Oh hell your right.  Lets all /feedback "people with jobs, wife/husband and
children should get 1 extra level per week, I can't play as many hours as a
power gamer, but I should still level like him!"

Welcome to EQ 2 years ago.  Im touched, really I am, that you are only level
43.  AFterall, with the last years changes, the game can hardly be any
easier now...

So make a melee.
Group.
Play on and off whilst reading a book / watching a show / learning something
/ input activity here.

Its a fact: the more people in a group, the less mana required per mob.
The less people, the higher the mana usage, the better the exp (and the
longer the downtime).
Don't act like you have no options.

I've sat in <insert zone name for long camp> doing nothing but wait hours
and hours (on rare occasion days), with nothing but the company of my
friends to keep us all entertained.

Sure waiting  days for rage, a day for Lodi etc sucked ass, but friends
don't NEED endless killing to have fun, we made the most of it, and the
endless camp became almost bearable.

Its nothing about feeling superior, KEI was DESTROYING the game, KEI on low
level people was also an EXPLOIT.  No ifs, no buts.  Now quit your damn
sniverlin old man.
