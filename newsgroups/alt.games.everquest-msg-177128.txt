You could try explaining to them that the account was paid for by a 
relative as a gift, but read the EULA first and make sure nothing was 
violated (I think giving the password out to anyone is a violation). 
It's probably easiest to just start a new character on the other server. 
  Just in case you do ever manage to get the transfer, give the new 
character a slightly different name.
