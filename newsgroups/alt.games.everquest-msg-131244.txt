Naw, there's times, albeit very rare ones.  I use Illusion: Ogre for the 
same purpose.  One I remember is when the freeport boat came in and didn't 
quite line up with the dock, leaving a gnome-sized gap for me to fall in.  
It was just small enough that I didn't fall all the way through, and yet
couldn't get back out.  So I Illusion: Ogre and pop! I'm back up. :)  
It's also been useful when some ogre sits right next to me and pins me to 
the wall.

And it really may have helped that swimmer.  But your center of mass has 
to be on the same side of the water's surface as him.
