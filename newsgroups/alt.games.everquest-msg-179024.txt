Not unexpectedly, since the GMs are sick and tired to tell people not to 
use /petition to have tech support issues resolved.

Open your UI_CharName_ServerNumber.ini file in your EQ directory (where 
CharName is your character's name, and ServerNumber is the number 
assigned to the server you play on... Unless you have multiple 
characters with the same name on different servers, it shouldn't matter).

Find the following lines:

[CompassWindow] XPos1280x1024=101 YPos1280x1024=797 BGTint.red=255
BGTint.green=255 BGTint.blue=255 Fades=true Delay=2000 Duration=500
Alpha=255 FadeToAlpha=255 Locked=false Show=1 XPos800x600=200
YPos800x600=200 XPos1024x768=96 YPos1024x768=542 XPos1600x1024=96
YPos1600x1024=798 XPos1600x1200=96 YPos1600x1200=974 XPos1280x960=200
YPos1280x960=200 XPos1280x768=200 YPos1280x768=200 XPos1280x720=200
YPos1280x720=200 

Those are the positions of the window for the different resolutions (
just as an example... I grabbed those lines off a random skin in 
EQInterface.com). You can enter manually the desired values, or make 
sure that none of them fall outside the boundaries of the current 
resolution.
