    I haven't played EQ2 that much, I have to admit, but it does seem to me
that 2 boxing would be a bit harder in this game than in EQL.  No just
hitting autoattack and wandering away for a soda or something.  However,
this is the first time I've ever played a MMORPG without a partner (Lenny
isn't interested in playing, mainly because of the 4 character rule), so I
might be way off base for that.

    I really enjoy the graphics as well.  I meet the recommended specs, so
I don't know how it might play on a somewhat less robust machine, but from
where I sit its a very pretty game.

   I dunno that I think that bashing on rats and snakes in inherently fun
anymore, and that might be part of my problem with the game in general.

   The Spell Checker is always right!  So, did you end up teaching it
"Aaaagh"?  I know I've taught mine all sorts of dubious words.
