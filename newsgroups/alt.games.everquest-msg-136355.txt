After patching my main PC was displaying skin textures as solid black (like
Gnome skin armour) this was mainly body locations but on some, Ogres for
example, was the entire body..very odd looking. All armour textures were
fine and if I used old models it was fine, problem just with Luclin ones.
Anyone know what I would need to delete and repatch to clear this? I tried a
thorough file check on patching but that didn't help.
In the end I copied all the files from second PC to main and backed up ini
and opt files and this cleared it but I'd rather know what files were
corrupted, any ideas?
