I'd suggest camping the Hermit in South Karana.  He respawns very quickly.
You'll still be medding from the last kill when he repops.  He is always the
same level.  I think it's level 20.  And he drops fine steel weapons pretty
often.  Only major downside is that a Tesch Mas Gnoll (red to you) wanders
by on occasion, so you should try and go invisible whenever you meditate.
Also, the nearest vendor isn't really near at all.  If I recall, I got
around this by binding at the Hermit's place then gating to GFay to sell and
bank and just gating back when I was good to go again.

You can find where he lives by checking the map on EQ Atlas.  The door to
his place cannot be opened, but it doesn't fit snugly in the doorway either.
Just line yourself up with the crack in the doorway and target the guy.
Drop your best nuke on him so he'll come running for you, then root and nuke
until he dies.

After typing all this up, I remembered that he is a druid, so may be harder
now because of the improved caster AI.  Still might be worth a try though.

Good luck.
