Subject: Level 28-30... where to fight, and WHO to fight...

I have a shaman, cleric, and beastlord - level 28 - 30.  And a druid 34.
My friend has a Mage, enchanter, and bard, same levels.  We want to group - no
"boxing", just me at my computer and him at his.
Has anyone found anywhere GREAT to play that would work for a couple of these
guys?  I know it's not the best "group" but still.....
Any advice greatly appreciated.
