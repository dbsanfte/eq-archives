Not to say it wasn't giving out Golden Tickets from server up BUT
there was an unfortunate bug involving bat wings which had to be fixed
immediately.  How the person found out about the bug I have no idea.

Anyway, confirmed prizes:

Deluxe Sewing Kit
Rubicite BP
All/All gloves with +15% apply poison and a right click DoT
Beer Goggles
Illusion potions
Lots of rubbish stat food
Fireworks
Armour gems (much easier to get your HoT BP gems now)
Gate potion
Assorted minor potions (a Harvest one, a Healing one)
Two charge rez stick
Five charge Illusion: Tree stick
The Sleepers resist stones
Prayers of Life (five charges Word of Healing)
Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse
Guise of the Deceiver
Very fast Drogmor/Horse
Pre-nerf Fungi Staff
Ton Po monk 2hb (procs 100 blows, old Trak loot I think?)
Holgresh Beads
Nexus gate necklace
Mistwalker (!!!)

Rough estimates were one Golden Ticket for every 10,000 tokens handed
in; with rough luck it would be perfectly possible to spend 100k and
get nothing of value though.

Primal was a hoax, Gnome mask was a hoax.  Casino is gone until the
New Year as the hordes using it caused SH to crash too often, who
knows if they'll keep the prize list as it was or change it.
