Focus items have no effect in spite of what is said here and elsewhere
until level 34. Still, nice to have sooner as they all add +2 int and
are usable as 1H blunt weapons.  At lv24 and better at lv29 you can
solo in Najena and get all 4 items (shovel, broom, stein, and torch)
needed for the 4 different focus item quests.  It took me about 6
hours at lv29 and they drop off any of the mages or higher level
skels.
