The Hollowshade war actually works now.  It's actually pretty fun.  The race
in control of the zone actually takes control of the Vah'Shir outpost and to
reset zone you have to kill this named.  Before they would never actually
take over the outpost so you couldn't reset the zone and it was necessary to
get GM intervention.  This was a serious pain.

Grimling forest I really didn't do a whole lot in before the revamp.  There
are Vah'Shir in the outpost who will lead you to Grimling camps.  When you
are ready to start the event you let them know and the camp changes and you
do your fights.  There is a general now who lists which events are completed
and which aren't.  It's actually pretty cool.
