Of course, that's assuming you can get *to* Thurgadin and then get *into* CC
in one piece, yeah, you should be ok. And at least on my server, there's
generally quite a few folks in there and you can sometimes get a p/u group,
unlike many dungeons.

That's going to be a lot of running and work. May as well just pull them to
the docks and fight them stationary. I don't think IC is a good place to fear
kite.  And the second island is home to a number of wanderers (shadow
guardians) that you may not care to run into at level 30. Not to mention the
occasional spawning on that island of Lozadil (sp?).  Granted, he's a most
impressive sight, which you'll get to enjoy for nearly a full two seconds if
your kiting takes you over his spawn point when he pops.
