Don't forget the Wizard Lure spells, which no other caster class gets.
I can think of many times this line of spells could come in handy. I
know it's not an offensive spell, but it requires you for a group, and
that is the ability to port to planes, which no other caster gets.

Personally, when I start forming groups, I always look for a Wizard
first for evac, maybe it's just my preference, and maybe it's because
I'm a caster who knows the capability of a Wizard nuke.. My preference
when finding group members is.. Melee = SK or Pally, healer = anyone
who can heal, crowd control & mana  = enchanter or necro, buffer =
shaman or druid, and what would be a better edition to the group for
evac?.. Wizard or Druid.. I'll take a Wizard any day.

Maybe I'm bias since I am one of those classes that were often not
wanted in groups. So I often want those who are not wanted in groups.

I'm sure there are times we all feel left behind or out of balance,
but I have noticed that it comes and goes with leveling. This actually
makes the game more challenging and makes it feel more rewarding when
you do feel powerful IMHO.
