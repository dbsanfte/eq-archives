The spell has very limited applications, but within those limits it's very
useful.

Yes, it works much, much better if you get Unfailing Divinity 3.  Also, the
higher the tank's charisma, the better.  Getting a CHA buff from a chanter
and be very helpful.

Once you've got that all set up, DI is a godsend (no pun intended).  It will
go off just about every time it can, allowing your tank to recover from a
missed heal or sudden damage spike during a fight with a named mob.  And the
more chances you have to keep your Main Tank up, the better you'll be.

This spell has almost no application during normal grouping.  But if you're
in a raiding guild, it's a necessary component of your raiding strategy.  As
such, you make yourself a  more useful cleric in a raiding guild if you have
this spell and the UD3 AA.
