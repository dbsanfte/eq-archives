The best thing is to train and watch your kids before they can walk.
The way to prevent them from getting trapped in the car is to teach
them how to open the doors from the inside so they can get out, to not
go into the car without mommy and daddy, etc.

I had semi abusive parents, but they did have some real good ways of
teaching us stuff. This was EONS before they quit making toy guns that
shot projectiles as well as being before those safety things for
cabinet doors under sinks.  What my Father did was grab us and shake
us, when we could barely move, then yell 

"IF YOU GO UNDER THE SINK AND DRINK THIS STUFF YOU WILL DIE. YOU WILL
DIE A HORRIBLE DEATH. IF YOU DON'T DIE I WILL BEAT YOU FOR DOING IT."

We never went under the sink and drank stuff, go figure. Actually I
think I was scared to even look at the doors under the sink for
several years.
