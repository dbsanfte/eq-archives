You got that mostly right... but I don't see how your conclusion follows the
available evidence.   What part of the Dex benefits are really getting you
excited, since I just don't see it?

As to the original question...  the first challenge with your rogue will be
getting stamina over 100, so that you don't do less damage in long fights.
For most rogues, this is indeed a challenge, since they usually start with
very low base stamina.

Once you've got stamina over 100, then you have a few more options.   A lot of
rogues I know will go for the strength.  Increased max damage (for those big
backstabs) and higher ATK rating for increased regular damage.   It's not a
huge effect, but some go for every point, to maximize thier roles as damage
dealers.  Other rogues will follow the less traditional method of HP, STA and
AC...  a very good comment I read in this newsgroup once...   "A dead rogue
does no damage."

Agility and Dex are worthless, in real terms.  The armor class increase from
Agility is so small that it's not worth getting.   Once you are over 80, you
are fine.  Dex is more beneficial, but only slightly.   If you have a proc
weapon, it will do a bit more damage with high dex.  (but it will also draw
the monsters attention to you more often.)

Also, you should probably factor in a bit what equipment is available out
there.   Strength items are almost everywhere.   On Rogue items, AGI and DEX
are common as dirt.  Even without trying, you'll end up with vast amounts of
each.  Stamina items on the other hand, are much, much harder to come by.
