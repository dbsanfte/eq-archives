Er why is it?   Were talking INDIVIDUAL CLASSES ATK BUFFS, no?

Not everybody has avatar, not everybody has primal, maybe 10% of my guild
rangers still use primal for any period of time whatsoever in their melee
slots (cursed claw and abhs is the general combo)

Bih'li: didn't used to stack with avatar(does now, intentional?), outdoor
only spell, so situational, but yes 15ATK I missed
Carnage doesn't stack with Avatar.

> Err yeah whatever.

So who the hell is better?  A class with a 6min ATK boost that uses a fuckin
peridot per cast?  /snicker

I spoke to my guildie rangers when I made my posts at the weekend, just to
make sure I wasn't talking out my ass about rangers being ATk buff kings,
not a single one of them thought any class came near to them for being best
ATK buffers.

And sure I don't know a thing about rangers, but they certainly do.
