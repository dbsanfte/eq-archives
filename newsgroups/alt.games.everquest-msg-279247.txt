When I came back to EQL (and subsequently to AGE), I noticed that the 
majority of the postings here were EQ2 related.  The nomenclature was that 
postings regarding EQL were denoted as such in the subject line.  It looks 
like over the past few weeks that has shifted ... the majority of the posts 
now seem to be about EQL.

Totally non-scientific ... just a casual observation.  I don't know if this 
is typical ebb and flow for the ng at this point, or if there has been an 
actual shift away from EQ2 by the folks who frequent the ng.

Or the third possibilty ... I'm all wet.  I'll grant you that I don't look 
at every single posting, so some postings that I think to be EQL related may 
in fact be EQ2 related.

Not trying to start a flamewar or pissing contest.  Just wondering if other 
folks had noticed this as well or if I'm seeing things in a skewed manner.
