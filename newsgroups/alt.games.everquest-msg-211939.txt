Quite a bit compared to what you are used to.  60 is a trivial level 
compared to the 50s, and to the rest of the 60s, so the percent xp loss 
is pretty large.  OTOH, the xp moves very fast in 60.  You are talking 
about unrezzed deah I take it?  I seem to recall it was something like 3 
or 4 blues, but, my memory is kinda fuzzy regarding that.  In level 65 it 
seems to be right around 6%.
