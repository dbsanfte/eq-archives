Then he won't be able to use his horse at all, which sort of
defeats the purpose.

THe real trick is to leave horse models on, but turn off the Luclin
model for your character's sex/race.  Then you can summon your horse,
but won't see it.

Another option is to try to get a shrink/grow.  For some reason
the horse head is less obtrusive at certain sizes.
