The Enchanter class is difficult to pinpoint a tactic for soloing, from
12-16 you have much the same to solo as everyone else. Kurns Tower would be
good as you have the dungeon bonus so will lvl quickly depending on how many
times you die. You should really be grouping as much as you can to practise
crowd control skills now. If you are going to solo there then a good tactic
for anywhere is Mez the mob, tashan, root and then DD. Our DD is all or
nothing so if the mob resists then the mez is not broke. When you hit, the
mob is rooted so will not fly at you. Remez and then DD again, reapply root
as needed.

As for Crowd Control you just have to learn in the field. You know what mez
does and how long it lasts. The trick is to teach your group how to work
with you. Be bossy as your life depends on it. Your group should have one
puller. He pulls and says what is incoming and says if there is an add.
After this he says which is the primary target. All other group members
/assist him on the primary mob and you target around him to mez the add(s),
if the mez fails and it leaps on you then flux and remez

Jewelcraft is a very expensive hobby, start it by putting as many prac
points in as you are allowed then just start with silver and Cats Eye agate
and when that trivial move onto the next gem.

See here for trivial list
http://eq.castersrealm.com/tradeskills/trivial.asp?tradeskill=4

Also it is cheaper to do the next metal and a low gem than try to increase
your skill with the current metal once you get up a bit. eg. cheaper to
train electrum + malachite and fail than silver+pearl and fail, both
increases your skill
