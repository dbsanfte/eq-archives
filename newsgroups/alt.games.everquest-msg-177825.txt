Hi,

had wired problems like this one too .

After the "first small" patch my beastlord (!!!) was wearing plateboots
(grin, not that I would not have loved the AC) but my hastebelt was gone
....

As I tried to bank I was really surprised my char had 0pp0gp0sp0cp on bank
... lost not that much like you had (think was about 1.5 k) but I wasnt
happy ...

Tried to petition but, like always, no GM was on (think they know about
their bullshit and dont want to be turned into punchingballs). Next day
after the re-re-repatch I had my normal boots and my belt back ... still
missing my money but GM (finally I got one lol) told me there is no way to
regain it as there have been several changes/patches between ...

Hmpf, what to do next time before patch ? Spend all money in items you might
be able to resell after patch ?

When I started playing EQ I always hoped things would get better any time
... some did, much more ones got even worse .... Lets see and wait what
"surprises" the new expansion will bring us LOL.

Have fun in game (as long as you can ;-))

Christian
