I would imagine it's a bit more complicated than you claim to implement 
a "test harness" that would put a character though various mob 
encounters, triggering all of the spells and abilities at their 
disposal. I'm not saying it can't be done. I'm just saying it's well 
within the realm of possibility that their testing mechanisms merely 
were not updated to consider the problem at hand.

Geez. Is it so hard to fathom how something just may have slipped 
through the cracks? To complain with such zeal about one bug in such a 
huge project is pretty unreasonable, especially considering the fact 
that it was turned around pretty quickly.

Show me this perfect development team you've envisioned that is 
magically able to catch any and all bugs in their enormous multi-server 
systems that are accessed on a world-wide scale, and accomplish this 
with a tiny fraction of the number of people and resources such an 
endeavor would require.
