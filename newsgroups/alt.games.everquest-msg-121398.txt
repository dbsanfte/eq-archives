I think your definition is flawed, or at least incomplete.
The "official" scientific definition (which, admittedly, I
haven't looked up) includes other criteria, if I recall
correctly.  Things such as the precise nature of the social
relationships between the pack members.

I can only respond briefly (I'm in a hurry), but if you or
someone else wanted to take a few minutes to find a good,
solid definition, I'd appreciate it.  I'm not even sure
where one might go (on the Internet) to find an "official"
description.
