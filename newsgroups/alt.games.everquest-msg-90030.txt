Pressing F10 does not change the camera view, it switching between full
screen with windows, full screen without windows, and the grey bordered
screen.  If you have everquest set so that it does not keep the same
resolution in the grey bordered screen, then this should work, so long as
you have the full screen mode set to a different resolution.  F9 does just
change the camera view, and certainly would have no effect on this problem.
