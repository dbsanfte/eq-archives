How?  Facing backwards and using arrows?  I can do that with axes, 
(34/31 at the moment) although it generally doesn't seem worth it, 
perhaps I'm just not that good at running backwards away from the group. 
  Funny thing is I was going to say "at running backwards" and then 
realized just how often I cover most of the distance back to the group 
doing just that and chain throwing, to get a 5% or so lead on hurting 
the target.

Is Innate Camo instant?  An invis that you can put in place while arrows 
are in mid flight is, I'm told, a very powerful pulling tool.  Outdoor only?

Or run to zone, which is a serious option in most outdoor situations. 
And you've got SOW.  Plus the rest of your group has SOW, which is quite 
possibly the best buff in the game in terms of letting people not get 
killed in bad situations.

Do rangers get the Shrew line in LDoN?  Can't tell you how happy I was 
to finally see run speed increases that didn't require groups to run 
outdoors in the middle of a long indoor run.

A will to do the job and some experience with it tends to make a decent 
puller of the classes worst suited to it, and an excess of caution or a 
lack of any can make a terrible puller in a class that is perfect for 
the job on paper.

Oh, I'm well past that, but the flip side is that pulls over 4 are often 
a crap shoot even with CC because a couple resists can kill the CC 
person and then the group has to deal with the whole magilla.  A ranger 
is his own mini CC, with root; as a berzerk I'm limited to what I can do 
by either picking a stun or a snare every 12 seconds.

I do group regularly with an enchanter friend, though, which means that 
with a little work I can start doing the "lull my target" plan, having 
chanter assist and lull mobs I've spotted for her.  I worked extensively 
with a husband and wife warrior cleric team which did this while I was 
on my mage.  Since I sometimes helped that duo out by running an eye of 
zomm in to tricky looking rooms, I'm even experienced enough that I 
could do the same using stalking probes.

I always enjoy pulling, even though I've rarely played a class thats 
good at the job on paper.  Much better than sitting back and waiting to 
see what someone else is going to bring in for you to work on.
