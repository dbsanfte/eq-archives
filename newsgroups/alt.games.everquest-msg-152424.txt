Why was EQ implemented the way it was?  It seems to punish those
without the time to play 10 hours a day 7 days a week?  And even
more it penalizes those who don't have the luxury of being able
to run multiple accounts simultaneously.  I think VI should award
me two free accounts with all expansions, a state-of-the-art system
with a VI certified copy of EQW pre-installed, and 12 free 4 hour
PL sessions assisted by the GM of my choice.  Oh, and I want my
Fiery Defender gift-wrapped and delivered to me at a "surprise"
party attended by at least two dozen well-wishers.

Hey!  I resent that!  Cranky I'll put up with, but "crabby" conjures
up images of some 84 year-old spinster chasing small boys out of her
apple tree, not at all an accurate description of me.

Kaev <--- who also has 24x7 broadband access, and thinks there are far
more significant things to bitch about in EQ than the implementation
of the bazaar, which actually works more-or-less well as it is
