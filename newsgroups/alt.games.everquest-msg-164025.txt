You have no reason to believe that. I say that most people just accept
the flaws, as I normally would.

Last I checked, there was nothing in the game that relied on the
ability to take a dump or get older. I'd say tradeskill items are just
a bit different.

Btw, a seasoned smith SHOULD have a FAR better chance of making
something trivial that they never made before than someone for whom it
has not even become trivial yet.

You may not have specifically, but you have tried your best to prove
to me how wrong I am when that is all I was saying to begin with. You
made more of an issue with the fact that I was miffed than anything
else. My part of this thread should have consisted of like three or
four posts:

Post 1: Crappy success rate...should be better than this...mad as
hell...

Post 2: No, not encumbered...many combines...

Post 3: Yes, I'm pretty sure I had enough of a data sampling to rule
out unlucky streaks...

Instead, you have waged a personal little war with me here. With which
point specifically are you taking exception? The fact that I feel I
should experience a better success rate? The reasons I feel that way?
Both points are purely my own opinion, so bugger off. You don't agree?
Fine. DULY NOTED. What else do you feel the need to say at this point,
and what would your motivation be for saying it? Whatever, please say
it and be done with it, because at this point, I don't expect anything
constructive, supportive OR topically relevant from you. Your
continued criticism is obviously intended to do no good.

OR they merely had the stomach to suffer through it. I have heard few
comment on how they enjoyed the skill up process. I'm not saying it
doesn't happen, different strokes and all. I'm just saying I SERIOUSLY
doubt it's anything close to the norm.

I never said it should be a perfect representation, just closer than
it is. Practice what you preach and don't put words in the mouths of
others.
