My first suggestion would be to put the settings back where they
were.....but I am sure you would have tried that if you could.

I would do the following....

1. Download the latest NVidia drivers from www.nvidia.com
2. Download the DirectX9 installer from www.microsoft.com/directx
3. Remove the old video card drivers. START->SETTINGS->CONTROL
PANEL-.ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS
4. Reboot
5. When Windows restarts cancel out of the hardware detection when it
finds the NVidia card and starts looking for drivers
6. Run the installer for DirectX9
7. Reboot
8. Install the new Nvidia drivers
9. Reboot
10. Adjust settings to your liking and test EQ.

Cheers
