I don't think bard haste has any effect on pets. Both you and the
necro have pets to add to the DPS. Hastening those pets makes them
much more effective.

DoT's and slow aren't much use.  You nukes aren't that efficient
normally, but in the rush of LDoN they are valuable.

Malo would help the wizard's nukes hit with fewer resists. I play a
mage and sometimes I find it's better to mala so others can hit for
full damage than to nuke for partial damage myself. When a shaman is
alteration specialized, his malX is probably much more mana efficient
than a mage's.

Not every cleric, shaman, or druid can remove curse eventhough it is
available via LDoN. If you don't have it, be one of the ones with it.
A shaman can also keep regen (or toss small heals) on the party to
save cleric mana. Regen is very good for a necro as it allows the
necro to leech mana longer. Many LDoN mobs and traps have some nasty
AOE. You can also root park mobs when the bard has just a little too
much to handle. 

A shaman is not a wizard or a warrior. Don't focus on what you usually
do directly to the mob as much as what you can do to help group's
efficiency.
