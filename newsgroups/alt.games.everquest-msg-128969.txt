No, no Pali loss of life, of course not!.  Look it, I know that sounds
calus, but the fact remains, THEY *themselves* don't even value their
OWN life (sucide bombers) - where do you get off questioning this ???

I'm a realist baby, and plenty more of me out there too!


> quit your blind preaching and lift a finger to do the research. 

Spent years researching this. Fact remains the same.  

> The oppression of any people is wrong. 

Do the A-rabs *really* feel this way?  Who in the Arab world is 
actually doing "assertive" things about it ??  If the A-rabs
were so "noble" as you imply, why not consider reverse-imbargo's
for human rights like WE do ?  

> The bombing of any people is wrong.

Sh-uuuuuuure it is, suuuure it is....  Go back and tell Historians of WWII.

> it doesn't matter how long talks last as long as people aren't mistreated.

Missplaced "empathy" without proportinate rational thought is useless.

With "bombs" ??  Rally? - how so?  ...I thought all they were doing
were playing kamikasi sucide games with exploding vests, no ?
(but bombing of *any* people is wrong, right?)

So why arn't the A-rab "brethern" coming to the rescue of the Pali's ?

>

I have. Again, a little "rational" thought process free of "emotion".
