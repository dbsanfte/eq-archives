I've been in Eastern Wastes since lvl39 and I'd like a change of scene.

I've tried Jaggedpine, but it wasn't 'interesting'!  I've had a look 
around the various websites and found al sorts of recommendations, 
almost too much choice :)

I had a look around the Gulf of Gunthak this morning and it looks 
interesting, but I haven't seen any advice on where and how to hunt, nor 
what to avoid.  Is this viable for me?  I am still just soloing since 
the only (rare) times I have been asked to group has been for LDoN which 
I don't have.

My other question relates to Wakening Lands.  I need to visit there soon 
for some spells, but all I seem to see is warnings that there is a nasty 
dragon(?) Which is likely to see me off in short order!  What's the 
truth behind this and can I venture there with 'reasonable' safety?

Any help gratefully received.
