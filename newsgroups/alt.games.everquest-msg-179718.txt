Jas.5
[1] Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall =
come upon you.

[2] Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

[3] Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a =
witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have =
heaped treasure together for the last days.

[4] Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, =
which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which =
have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.

[5] Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have =
nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

[6] Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.

[7] Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, =
the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath =
long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.

[8] Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord =
draweth nigh.

[9] Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: =
behold, the judge standeth before the door.

[10] Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the =
Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.

[11] Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the =
patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is =
very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

[12] But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, =
neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be =
yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.

[13] Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him =
sing psalms.

[14] Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; =
and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the =
Lord:

[15] And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall =
raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.

[16] Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that =
ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man =
availeth much.

[17] Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed =
earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the =
space of three years and six months.

[18] And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth =
brought forth her fruit.

[19] Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;

[20] Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of =
his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of =
sins.
