Bah, you can't base the norm on the most ZEM-whacked zone in the game. If 
they wanted decent gear, they would do their time in the Karanas or EC/WC 
farming silks and skins to sell long enough to get some good spending 
money. I know I did. Because I was willing to do this, I wound up with 
great gear for my level without the help of a single person.
