You get 10 baskets on one combine as I recall, so two combines gives you on
stack.  Mandrake root is 2.1pp I think, takes four to make one stack of
baskets, steel boning is cheap to make, probably less than 1pp.  So, costs
10ish pp to make one stack.  I don't think you should lose any sleep over
the price you are paying for them.  That's 90ppish profit on that stack of
baskets.  If anything, maybe you should talk to them about their price.
When I do combines for guildmates/friends, I charge my cost.  If we are
talking about significant amounts of combines, like 100s of baskets, then, I
would likely charge extra.  At 15pp each, that's 300pp for a stack, or 290pp
profit.  Make sense now?  :)   Hmm, I should get into the basket business.
Or are you talking about 100s of MTPs?
