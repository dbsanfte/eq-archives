The General Dies during the 8th shawl escort? I just completed my kit and
got the Dain's orders now all that is left is the escort. While I don't
think it will be a problem ...I have done it once already with someone
else...I was just curious as to what exactly happens if the general should
die. I haven't seen it posted anywhere. Do you lose everything and have to
start from square one again? Or does the general leave a corpse that you can
loot your kit off of and just have to do the escort again? has anyone seen
this happen?
