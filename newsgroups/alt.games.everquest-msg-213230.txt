.....you sound like one of those people who blame god for things that went
wrong in their life (bruce almighty, anyone?)

yeah, it blows, but it was done in fairness...look around, necros took it up
the rear about 3ish years ago, but there are still tons of them
around...part of EQ is living under the rule of a big nerf bat

wrong! you can make back the cash as fast as you want.....every kei
man/woman/scaled wolf (love that spell!) is limited only by their own
dedication to their trade

then you're a sucker if you regret it....charity is charity, but charity +
regret is foolish.......if someone drops 5p in your window for a buff, you
EARNED that 5p; someone is telling you they respect you and what you do and
think you should be compensated

join the club (or start a wizard, and join the KS club....that's even more
satisfying =b )

there are some really sweet freakin' spells out there......go MGB something,
or start a SK and cast the swirly blue spell of hate, or go charm a griffen
and hand it an item with a book graphic, then run around and tell people
that Professor Peter the Griffen is giving out lessons on how to make
puppets out of houses

while that is our designed role, your efficiency and style will separate you
from other enchanters

well in that case, EQ is definitely a bad fit for you
