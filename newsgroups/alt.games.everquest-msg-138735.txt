You know what? I sincerely believe they will before long. The reason? 
Well, many, many people have grown addicted to the Bazaar, to the point 
where they wouldn't mind having two or more accounts, but they are being 
put off by needing two computers (not everybody has heard of EQW, or 
would know where to get it).

Allowing people to Alt-Tab would be such an obvious revenue-maker for 
Sony, that I will be surprised if it isn't implemented within weeks, 
rather than months.
