Twenty percent mana with KEI is certainly a bit different from twenty 
percent mana without. You can lob another high mana nuke knowing it won't 
be long before you will be able to throw something else. Without KEI, you 
know there won't be time to get mana back up for anything else, so, yes, 
you do have to consider mana efficiency moreso here.

What will be next when the KEI fix isn't enough anymore and people want 
things to come still faster and more easily?
