I still don't quite understand the particulars of a HO. I understand how 
they are executed and a rogue's ability to shift them, but the idea of 
coordinating one so that no one casts or strikes out of turn seems to be 
both a logistical nightmare (especially in a pick-up group) and, from my 
soloing experience, a huge inefficiency. 

While solo'ing, HO's really pay off, as I am merely executing the moves I 
would otherwise, giving me a bonus to damage or a beneficial buff every 
couple of attacks.

When in a group, it seems like everyone almost has to stop attacking so the 
chain can be completed successfully. Also, how do you establish who is 
responsible for which part of the chain? Is that even necessary? Does this 
create a situation where only certain members of the group end up 
participating in the chain? If so, why would the other members even stick 
around? I mean, it seems you would always want to be using HO's, and if 
GroupMember_01 is a mage with the best nuke and therefore the logical 
choice to handle the DD links in the chain, that kind of leaves out any 
other DD classes where HO's are concerned.

Like I said, maybe I'm just missing some of the particulars. Is it any non-
chain-condusive action that will break a HO chain, or just particular ones? 
How does a group use HO's effectively without everyone stopping their 
attack except for the player who is next to execute a step in the HO?
