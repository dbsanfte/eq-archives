When I leveled up my barb I collected the Ruined bear skins and started to
tailor some basic armor, you'll have a full set in no time.  Also you can
turn in polar bear skins to a local merchant (forget name, but she's near
the well in town) who will reward you with xp+pp+armor.  Also save the High
Quality bear skins and sell to tailors for 20-30p each.

After L15 get to paludal and kill the bandits, they drops descent bronze
armor and the xp is unmatched at that level range (15-25).
