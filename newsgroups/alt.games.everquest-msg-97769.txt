Shadeweavers is awesome. Probably just behind Everfrost and ahead of
MT on your list (though I would put Paineel ahead of MT too).

Hollowshade moor is AWFUL. The time to introduce newbies to undercons
is not L1. The beetles are badass for their level.

Shar Vahl's crater is *okay*. It's fairly bad at some times and fairly
good at others. There's lots of mobs. I'd call it high end of decent
on your list.

I disagree with some spots. BB is good to great for L5 and up but it
sucks donkey gonads before that. Ill Omen - you run out of those low
level mobs real fast. As I said before I would rank Steamfont way
higher.
