The romantic/comedy film "LA Story", which satirizes
a lot of things about Los Angeles, has a good scene
along those lines.

Steve Martin is at home when his friend calls and
invites him to come on over.  He says, "ok", hangs
up, goes out into his driveway, gets into his car,
and drives to his friend's house -- she lives next door.
