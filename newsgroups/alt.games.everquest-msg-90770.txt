Huh?  Nah, I never used AE Mez there.  You're right, 3 enchanters is great
to have but even with 2  (54/56) we didn't have much trouble single target
mezzing anything.  At most we only had about 5 or 6 birds (unnamed) which I
can usually take care of solo, but DAMN is it nice to have a second
enchanter around to back me up. <g>

When we got to the Prince I memmed Charm up for a big overpull, but our
puller had learned how to FD pull Royals by then (AWAY from the rest of us)
and I never needed it.  When we got to the King unfortunately some weird
aggro thing happened while simply clearing his area and got about 8,
including the King and we were dead long before I could get a charm off.
