If it's true then well done SoE.

I was playing a few hours ago and was wandering by the scarecrow field in 
Antonica. I thought i'd give a scarecrow a go but to my annoyance all I 
couldnt. There were three groups running around, as soon as a scarecrow 
appeared the tank taunted and got him. This was happening all the time.

As a predator I have to get into position to attack and simply couldnt get 
one in time. Even when the group were fighting, they had another guy who 
would attract the spawning crows.

After 15 minutes I gave up. I dont mind people camping for a short while but 
somepeople are just taking the piss. I came across one group before that did 
10 hours straight on the scarecrows!
