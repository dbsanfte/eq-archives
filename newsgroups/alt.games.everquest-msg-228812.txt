<shrug> Tastes differ but PoP was my least favorite expansion when it
first came out. Don't forget that for months you had to fight lvl 55+
mobs to get exp at 65 (which meant you had to fight in PoP) and you
had to get people flagged for anything past the Tier 1 zones. What I
hated about it was that I couldn't advance at my own pace, I was tied
to the pace of friends/guild. Didn't matter that I was flagged for
PoV/S about a month after it came out, the people I grouped with
weren't. Didn't matter that I couldn't leveled to 65 in a few weeks,
my friends were mostly still in their 50s and until they caught up, if
I'd leveled there would've been no place to realistically group wtih
them. Friends in raid guilds got their flags and there was nothing
left for them in the zones where I was hunting. No matter how I look
at it, for my playstyle PoP was an incredibly fucked up expansion when
it was first released.
