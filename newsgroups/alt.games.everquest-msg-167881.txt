Lol, first of all trying to sell an accout with a 45 char being the 
highest, thats bad enough.
Selling your accout when youre guild leader and appearantly not giving 
up that status before selling is even worse.

And like the "All characters are in good standing with EQ and SOE.". 
Wonder how many minutes thats gonna last.
