    Suck it and see. OR you can collect a swatload of deathfist belts, grab
a wolf form off someone, and hand them into the captain in the militia hall.
He might hate you but for some reason he quite likes wolves. I guess elves
REALLY smell bad? ;)

    My main is KOS there too and invis only gets you so far. One of the
guards outside the militia hall sees right thru it and he brings the lot of
them after you. I like invis + sow and i scream into nfree before you can
say "deadmeat sk"

Cheers,
James
