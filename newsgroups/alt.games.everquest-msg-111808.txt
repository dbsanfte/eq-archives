Your turn to have missed the point.  Your question was:

"Since the word scimitar is I believe arabian , I have no idea why
they chose to call the curved blade that."

My answer was:

"Druids in EQ can wield scimitars because Druids in D&D can wield
scimitars.  Druids in D&D can wield scimitars because they are
somewhat sickle-shaped, and therefore give Druids a *big* sickle with
which to hit things.  This is because the guys who originally made D&D
wanted to differentiate between Fighters, Clerics, and Druids."


The fact that *real* ancient Druids used straight blades, curved
blades, or whatever is irrelevant.

The creators of D&D arbitrarily assigned the scimitar (an Arabian
weapon) to Druids to differentiate them from Clerics (to whom they
gave the disadvantage of not being able to use edged weapons).

They didn't "call a Druid's curved blade a scimitar"; they said
"Druids can use scimitars".

Your statement would have equally allowed them to "call a Druid's
curved blade a sabre".  No.  They didn't say "Druids can use sabres".
They said "Druids can use scimitars".

Again, the fact that *real* ancient Druids used some sort of curved
blade has no bearing on the question.
