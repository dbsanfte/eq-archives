Defensive is gained at level 55. Before that it isn't an issue.

SKs and Pallys can "MA" and tank as well or better than a Warrior (SKs
can generate agro like no other class) in a typical EXP grind. 

I agree that SK/PAL melee damage is not up to par with what a WAR can
dish out, but in a well balanced group (Nukers and/or MNK/ROG/RNGR)
you can swap one for the other without losing killing efficiency.
