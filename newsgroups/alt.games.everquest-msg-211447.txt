Well, that comment need not be restricted to choosing a tank.  I hope
you will pardon the following suggested edit:
"... given the choice between a dumb [player] and a [player] who
[has a clue], I would suggest the group opt for the [clueful player]."

After all, plate tanks have no monopoly on ignorance, stupidity, and
incompetence.  And I'd say you're better off fighting somewhere with
less extreme tanking requirements if your choices are an incompetent
plate tank or a Ranger who just isn't tough enough, there's not much
to be gained by enduring pointless deaths or extreme down-time.
