What makes you think it won't happen?   It already has.


The Diety Symbols quests for Quellious are chain quests that begin at low
levels, and produce upgraded neck items at each of the various stage.    So
far no diety has gone beyond the third step, but judging from the progress so
far and the examples we have such as the Coldain Shawl and Ring series quests,
these will most likely turn out to be extremely powerful items.  Aside from
that, they are also quests that players will want to complete for the
roleplaying value.

The quests for Quellious (Erudite clerics) require no drop items that come
from the Warrens.   So, if you happened to be above level 10, you cannot
complete your diety's quest because of the TCC.    These quests were added
after the Trivial Combat Code was introduced...  Verant knew they wouldn't be
able to get the items, and they screwed up and put it there anyways.

If you were trying to show that people are overreacting...  giving an example
of a place where they shouldn't overreact and didn't doesn't really help you.
