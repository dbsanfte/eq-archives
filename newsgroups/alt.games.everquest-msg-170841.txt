I'll tell you what, jodakim, I'll answer this post and forget the one you
sent never happened, since you seem more reasonable, and I don't want to
have to tell you to f'sk off.

They have access to condoms without the school providing them.

I doubt any teenager doesn't know that the local convienance store or drug
store sells condoms.  I'll give you the embarasment part.  And as far as the
"heat of the moment" goes, if they don't have a condom, then they don't have
one, regardless of whether it's not from 7-11 or from school.  I doubt
they'll be headed to school in the heat of the moment to get one... unless
they're under the stands...

That's where we disagree.  If the school is handing out condoms, I would
practically take that as license to have sex.  I think this is where our
difference lies.
