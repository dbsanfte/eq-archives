  I don't know why your friend would be taking less damage if you have a
higher AC, unless you're going up against a caster and he has higher
resists.  However, a couple reasons you might be doing more damage to a mob
when he tanks is: One, because you're not getting stunned as often, you are
dishing out more damage.  You probably can do a lot more damage per second
than your paladin friend, so when you are stunned, it has a greater effect
on your group's damage output than when he is stunned for the same period of
time.  The other reason is because you do get a bonus for attacking a mob
from behind, so if the mob is facing your friend, and you're standing behind
it, you will be dealing out more damage than usual (how much more, I don't
know).

  Since your damage output is better than his, this may be why it seems
better to let him tank.  The fights end faster because you're dishing out
more damage by smacking on the mobs back and not getting stunned as often,
thus the mob has a smaller window of opportunity to dole out damage of its
own, so your pal ends up taking less damage than you would if you were
tanking.

  That would be my guess as to what is happening, if it isn't indeed your
imagination. :)
