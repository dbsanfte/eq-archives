Hi

So far all my characters have done their starter armour quests. Though 
most ditched their weapon as soon as they could find a better one: (2 
still have theirs, 2 purchased new ones, 1 Was a thank you present, 1 
was this loot is rotting anyone want it)

My ranger finally laid up her last piece of Thorn Mail for Ivy Etched at 
level 35

The Stat's for the full set of Thorn Mail were: AC46  Str8  Wis4  Dex3 
Sta2 Hp14

While my Vah Shir beastlord is still in the quested general Vah Shir 
starting armour at level 32 apart from 3 items.

All my other characters are in their 20's all have a full set of quested 
armour.

The only quested armour that needed outside help was my Gnomes 
Enchanters armour. The large Group of evil gnomes you needed to kill to 
get the last pieces of the puzzle. Needed the combined efforts of 2 
parties of 6 gnomes. A mini raid at level 10, great fun. But a nightmare 
to try and organise.

3 hours to set up. 2 failed attempts and then it needed to be repeated 3 
times to let everyone get their drops. Over an entire day to get 2 
items. But some of the best fun I have had in EQ. Though I do feel it 
was a tad hard for the level of characters that needed those items.

Overall it finally depends on your play style.

If levelling fast is all your interested in then buying is the only way. 
As the quests all take time
(4 weeks to get the Giant Fruit Bat Ribcage for my Rangers tunic) and in 
the end the armour is only average in the terms EQ of "Twinking" (The 
passing down or purchasing of equipment that is well beyond the level 
that the character could have obtained even with the aid of a group) 
Also the 'Newbie' zones don't give the best experience points per kill.

If your aim is to explore and try new things. Then the quested armour is 
a good introduction to the EQ world. Also spending 3 to 4 weeks in a 
zone hunting the bits means you soon get to met others looking for 
similar items. In future they could end up as your guildmates or 
friends.

In the end you pay your money and you make your choice :)
Yours
