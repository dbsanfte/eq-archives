Except that 'merchandise' doesn't change hands. It stays with Sony the 
whole time. Worse you can't even say it went from your account to my 
account, because the accounts are not property there is no 'your 
account' or 'my account' legally, SOE clearly stipulates that we only 
subscribe to connect, and have no 'ownership' of the account or the 
'virtual assets'.

If someone gave me 50 bucks to drop 10,000 plat on a merchant it would 
be a virtually identical transaction as far as the courts were 
concerned, and just as impossible to stipulate that I was selling 
something that wasn't mine.

Are DVDs and CDs a big illegal scam too?

No movie retailer has ever advertised "selling rights to watch 
movies"... they "sell movies".... except that they don't...not really. 
They don't own them before they sell them and I don't own them after I 
buy them.

I fail to see temporal order of service relative to payment as relevant?!

Legally, I don't think the courts are at the stage where they are going 
to recognize sitting in your den, playing on your computer, as 
'conducting business' on someone elses property. At worst, they'll note 
that sony expressly forbids it and reserves the right to dicontinue 
connection priviledges... and simply advise sony to exercise that right.

Furthermore, a civil suit can really only sue for damages. SOE would 
have a very shaky case arguing that they were 'damaged' by the plat seller.
