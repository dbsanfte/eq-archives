Sigh...

Ok, so I was logging in and instead of hitting the NO THANKS button on the
stupid spam screen, I was trying to do 15 things at once and hit the Pre Order
Now button instead.

Couple of problems with this...  Firstly, I don't WANT to pre order the damn
thing.  I want to wait and buy it in the store.

Secondly, the credit card on my account is my PayPal account which at the
moment has a total of $18.00 in it, so obviously not enough to pay for GOD.  

How can I cancel this mistake and WHY THE F*CK don't they give you a double
check screen after you hit the preorder button to make sure that you intended
to do that?  

Sorry for the caps.  :(  Not yelling at you guys, just yelling in general...
and shaking my fist and cursing Sony, and etc...  

Thanks in advance,

Joolz
