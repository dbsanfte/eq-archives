i like lvling fast, seeing how quick i can get my characters to the 50's.  i
have played 2 characters from scatch to mid 50s, twinked a warrior and got
him into 50's, and i have several other twinked characters i enjoy playing.
i was considering creating a new character, and seeing how quickly i could
hit the mid 50s or even 60.  i just wanted some opinions asto what you
people think would be the fastest lvling race/class combo.  i was thinking a
twinked human monk would lvl fast, anyone have better ideas or opinions?
