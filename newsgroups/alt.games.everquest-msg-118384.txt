I haven't played my necro for a while, but decided to pull him out.  I was
doing well with the cougars in IceClad.  I have just hit 34 and with it got
a new shielding spell (Greater Shielding, IIRC).  Needless to say, my
abjuration skill  is in need of improvement.... it is at a good level
somewhere around 85.

I try to buff up, and had a streak of fizzles that made me want to cry, 47
in a row!!!  Good thing it has a long duration.  Then next time I tried to
buff up with it, I had 25 fizzles.  If that spell hasn't saved me so many
times, I would be thinking about going without it.  Its a problems that i
need to deal with... come to think of it, my evocation isn't all that great.
I am sure I will be pulling out my hair if I every hunt undead.

The question is - what is the quickest way to increase the skill.  Is it
going to be with the level 1 spell and chain cast it, or do I need a higher
level spell to get a skill increase.  BTW, for those of you keeping score -
I cast (or tried to cast) it over 100 times and zero increases.
