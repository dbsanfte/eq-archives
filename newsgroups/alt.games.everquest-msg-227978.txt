Yeah if they cant balance the 15 they have will adding another really
help? It certainly will mean even more overlapping of skills and more
whinning that class 1 has more of this power than class b..

No one has seen what the bezerkers are going to do, anything on that
is speculation and fear or hope depending on the eyes of the beholder.

As most things are broken on test with regard to the new melee system
on test, I cant say I can agree with that, monks have a huge variety
of special moves, I wasnt going to say DPS, however, I was thinking it
would make a lot of sense for them to have a lot of the openings they
have talked about, as most monks are behind the mob and swift,
therefore Id expect them to be more able to spot an opening than
someone swiinging huge fat swords about the place.
