For those who need a brake from EQ :)

Was overcharged on my account and have 4 months left on it but no time
to play this game anymore. I have a level 34 hunter on it.

Allowing thousands of players to adventure, grow, and even fight one
another, Dark Age of Camelot is set in Europe's mythological past.
Incorporating Arthurian legends, Norse mythology, and Irish Celtic
lore, Dark Age of Camelot truly is the next step in online role
playing games.

Live the Legend!


Selling for only $75 which is value of Account time left. Game is free
(Worth $50)
