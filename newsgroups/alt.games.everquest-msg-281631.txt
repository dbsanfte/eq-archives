 all good suggestions, thanks but I've already been there, done that.
However I did solve the problem.  Somehow my primary and secondary DNS
numbers were incorrect.  After putting the correct DNS numbers in the dial
up networking connection it is downloading again.  I've seen online others
having this exact same problem that the download just stops at the file
EQLS_window_pieces_02.tga.  If this is your problem I would suggest checking
your DNS numbers.  It fixed mine.

Thanks everybody
