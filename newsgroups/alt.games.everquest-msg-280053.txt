There were some numbers some months ago on a public press release
from SOE stating EQ2 has around 600,000 subscribers,though it wasnt
clear if these were only EQ2 subscribers or "station pass"
subscribers,negative as I am usually are here,I would suspect the
latter,seeing that EQ now has only 21 servers left,which can handle
about 10k subscribers,my guess is that the number of EQ subscribers
is much lower than the number of EQ2 subscribers.
Well,I wouldnt mind EQ running longer than EQ2,all my postings 
about how bad SOE's business strategy is would be turn out to 
be right.  =)
