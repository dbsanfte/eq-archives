The #1 reason I left that sorry excuse for a MMORPG, was the complete lack 
of customer service. For instance, they provided a means of submitting a 
support ticket in-game, but would periodically purge all tickets because 
they could not keep up with them all. It wound up being a lottery type 
scenario for your ticket to ever even be seen, much less acted upon. 
Communication was *extremely* rare. Of all the legitimate issues being 
brought to their attention, they hardly ever even offered a simple, "We 
agree this is a problem, and are looking into it." They just never 
communicated. There were some *very* big issues brought to their attention 
and they just wouldn't respond. It was the non-verbal equivalent of telling 
us to "deal with it".

Certain classes and tradeskills were completely neutered by horrible design 
and/or balancing tactics. Hello, droids anyone? If you wanted to be a bad 
ass, you bought a ridiculously-overpowered pet. If you wanted an extra 
inventory slot (just one, mind you) you bought a droid. The lack of uses 
for a droid did not come close to justifying the cost of creating one. They 
couldn't repair, though there was one called a repair droid. They couldn't 
heal, though there was one called a surgical droid. Combat? Puh-lease. I 
don't know where they ever got it into their heads that droids had no place 
in combat, but they all but eliminated their value in that regard as well.

The rifleman class was another prime example of a wasted effort. Sure, you 
could do a share of damage from maximum distance, but once the enemy began 
to close on you, you were toast. Now I could live with that arrangement 
under normal circumstances, because in a group, I could still really 
contribute to the overall damage done. However, they made it so that the 
Pistoleer and Carbineer were just as efficient at ranged attacks as the 
rifleman, plus they were even better in close-quarter combat.

You guessed it, I was a Master Droid Engineer with what little combat 
skills I could spare dedicated to the Rifleman class. I got sick of waiting 
for them to do something useful with droids and sick of getting my butt 
handed to me in combat. This was the worst display of incompetent class 
balancing I've seen in any game I've played. Then again, much of the 
problems between the various classed also stemmed from the fact that there 
were so many abilities that were broken or just plain didn't work in 
serveral cases.

Aside from the mistakes in game design and inexcusable lack of customer 
service and community presence, I would say they also dropped the ball on 
gameplay in general. In that regard, for everything they did well or even 
revolutionized (crafting, user interface, character customization), they 
seemed to take some of the cheap aspects from other games and expanded upon 
them. In an effort to multi-classing work, they pretty much wound up with 
tons of people all going after the same ultimate kit combination. There was 
not enough variety, because they made it possible for everyone to get the 
best of all worlds. You could be the ultimate warrior with far too little 
time expendature. I don't want a game where even the most lazy player can 
easily succeed to the same extent as the most dedicated. In EQ, I like the 
fact that, though there are still plenty of level-65 jerks and idiots I'm 
sure, at least a good portion of the lazy, flighty, flaky players have 
given up on a character before taking it that high. I don't think I 
*should* be uber if I'm not willing to invest the time and effort. In SWG, 
that investment is far too small. It gives you the feeling that you've done 
all there is to do before too long.

"Cool! A Star Wars game! Wait, where are all the spaceships?"
"Why does everyone have an animal following them everywhere?"
"Aren't there supposed to be droids and other mechanical objects?"

I could go on.
