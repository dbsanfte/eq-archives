While he has some points, I also see a lot of things that I disagree with. 
His ideas on permanent death and instancing for example. The first RPG I 
played had perma-death, and it basically sucked mainly for that reason. The 
problem with perma-death is NOT getting killed, it is that people get so 
afraid of getting killed and losing all their time and effort up to that 
point, that they avoid any risks, stop exploring, and generally only do 
things that are totally safe. The author totally failed to recognize that 
factor in his assumptions.
