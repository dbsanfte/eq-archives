I'm pleased to say that I have no personal experiences to offer. Even
if I did, personal anecdote is generally meaningless in a debate.

I don't know how many Wiccans you have in your work place, so I can't
speak to that point. You may well be in a large company that has
clearly defined policies against discrimination; you may be in a
company that has no public Wiccans; you may just be working in a place
run by decent people. Is your employer currently interested in hiring
a Delphi programmer to work remotely? :)

I would think the newspaper links I've provided recently would be
concrete evidence that discrimination against Wiccans does happen. If
you want more, here are two I had at hand...

Then let us discard that assertion as being as meaningless as personal
anecdote, shall we?
