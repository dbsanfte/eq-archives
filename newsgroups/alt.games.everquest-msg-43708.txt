Isn't it obvious that you just proved it's NOT Verant's problem??  I mean come
on... one dial up number works, another doesn't.  Therefore: it's your ISP (or
somewhere close to it).  (*Gasp* imagine that, saying "It's your ISP" may have
been correct!)

EQ isn't "sensitive to the actual hardware the UDP packets are routed
through."  It's sensitive to whether or not the UDP packets get there in the
first place!  If they're not getting there, it's a problem outside of Verant's
domain.  To me, it sounds like one of your ISP's POPs is having issues.  Hell,
maybe it's a particular bank of modems.  Maybe the POPs are using different
connections to the internet, and one of them is flaky, but for the love of
god, it's NOT Verant.  Bah.

If the new eqmain.dll seems to make a difference, it's a coincidence.  All
this means is that your ISP happened to start having problems around the time
of a patch.
