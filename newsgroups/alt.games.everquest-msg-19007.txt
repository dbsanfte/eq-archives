Definitely EQ is addictive (and if any of you has read the Stephen King
book "Hearts in Atlantis", I mean *that* addictive), but if you are the
kind of person who can't give a 10k item to a vendor and just /shout to
the zone "I gave Uberitem to a vendor, please give /tell calling me an
idiot, thanks!", and carry on playing, you maybe shouldn't have started
in the first place.

On the other hand, this is my personal opinion: Some people will die and
have nothing but EQ to show for their time here, but some people will
die and have even less to show for it. People who get so terminally
involved in EQ do so because their real lives aren't very rewarding to
start with, so who could possibly blame them? EQ is a better way to
scrape some enjoyment out of a bad life than heroin is.

OTOH, yes, everybody should get out and see the sunshine every now and
then...
