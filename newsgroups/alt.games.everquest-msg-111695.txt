Giant size. And yes, they would suck for carrying around, even if you're
an Ogre. But ideal for the bank. I have seven or eight in the bank on
all the characters I play now. Frees up the deluxe sewing kits for
travel purposes where needed. Only seven on my warrior, btw, because I
always keep a coffin in the bank. In retropsect, this is now stupid,
since I'm bound next to the bank in the bazaar and the guy who sells
coffins is five feet away. *sigh*.
