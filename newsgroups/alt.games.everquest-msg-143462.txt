Autosplit is evil.  It makes you think you are splitting the loot with
some degree of fairness, when in fact you are giving the looter the
bulk of the cash.

This is because autosplit splits the coins, not the cash value, and
gives any leftover coins to the looter.

This is discussed in thread after thread, but here's a short example

loot 7pp 6gp 5cp 4cp

Two people
Looter 4pp 3gp 3sp 2cp
Partner 3pp 3gp 2sp 2cp
Fair split 3pp 8gp 2sp 7cp


Three people
Looter 3pp 2gp 3sp 2cp
Partners 2pp 2gp 1sp 1cp
Fair split 2pp 5gp 5sp 1cp and one cp left over

Four people
Looter 4pp 3gp 2sp 1cp
Partners 1pp 1gp 1sp 1cp
Fair split 1pp 9gp 1sp 3cp and 2cp left over


Five people
Looter 3pp 2gp 1sp 4cp
Partners 1pp 1gp 1sp 0cp
Fair split 1pp 5gp 3sp 0cp all 4 cp left over

Six people
Looter 2pp 1gp 5sp 4cp
Partners 1pp 1gp 0sp 0cp
Fair split 1pp 2gp 7sp 5cp and 4cp left over

Fun eh?  FFA with autosplit on means the looters
get the majority of the coins and the cash value,
but feel like they are splitting fairly with the people
who are sitting down medding.  If you stop
using autosplit, then its more obvious to everyone
that the looters are getting the cash.

In addition, this spams small coin across your
group, annoying everyone a little and monks a lot.
Since you eventually will end up grouping with monks
quite often, learning not to autosplit early on will serve
you well.

If you want to be fair, the real secret is to have a
Master Looter loot everything, and split the cash
and junk up whenever you lose or gain a member.

Of course, since the game has been in existance for
quite a while, most people you play with at lower
levels are running their second or third or sixteenth
character, and may very well not care about the
so called loot (amounting to a couple pp an hour)
at all, which is where the FFA system comes in...
here the fact that the looters are getting all the loot
is actually a bonus, since the twinks don't have to
bother with all that small change... unless someone
is being annoying and autosplitting.
