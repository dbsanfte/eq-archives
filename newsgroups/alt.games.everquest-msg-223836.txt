Well, he *has* pants, Ripped leggings of the Immortals to be precise,
but they do not show up on him.

This is not a graphics glitch on my end - no one sees him wearing pants,
whether he is wearing summoned leather, hopperhide or the RLotI.  A
couple of days ago they were showing up just fine - dyed black they
showed up as those pads-and-straps things that Vah Shir have with leather
pants.

Any other Vah Shir wearing leather appears correctly.  My kitty, however,
appears pantless to me on his machine in 3rd person, to my mage on his
machine and to everyone I asked.  I deleted all the .txc files and every
file with his name on it - to no avail.

I also played with dyes - again to no avail.  /dopropertinting on or off
(with a zone after each change) - nothing.  I'm out of ideas.

Has anyone heard of this before?

I petitioned, but I expect that to have about as much effect as staring
real hard at the screen and hoping they magically change back.

It's a trivial thing, I know, but I play in 3rd person and it bugs me.
