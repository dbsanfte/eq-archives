Um, why would there even *be* a corpse if you respawn with your stuff?

That's the official word - the xp curve from 1-50 will be smooth, the
total xp will be the same.

Interestingly enough, this was never a rite of passage at the inception
of the game, IT NEVER WENT AWAY.

In fact, new info points to an xp bonus for folks under 30 in dungeons.
They are trying to get the lower level crowd out of LoIO/SK and back
into dungeons.  This is a good thing.  Let them learn the differences

The "Vision" was mostly Brads.  He was locked in on his notion of
how the game *should* be played, not how it *was* being played.  With
his absence many *very* good things have transpired.
