As a 35 almost 36 Barbarian Warrior myself, my best suggestion for getting
through level 30 and 31 is to travel to High Pass Keep and hunt in the
basement.  Find yourself a good group.  I was in a group who camped the
Warriors Room in the basement of High Pass Keep and made all of level 31 in
about 4 hours of playing.  Level 32 is also doable in High Pass Keep but
once you hit 33 then it is time to move on to The Over There next to
Frountier Mountains.  The Over There should carry you through your high 30s
without too much difficulty.  Last week I got all of level 33 in about 5
hours of hunting with a group in OverThere.  Just watch out for the Goons in
that zone.
