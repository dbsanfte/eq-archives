Below 30? I had a devil of a time finding groups all the way up to 60. Now
im 60 and hav pop, I have no troubles finding a gorup. Just turn on LFG and
wait a while for tels. before tho, I could spend a whole day LFG and get
nowhere.
Now I sit and make money from KEI at the expense of other chanters. The
demand and the profit you can make are scary.
I think making it last so long was a big mistake, but now ive got it of
course I dont want it changed.
