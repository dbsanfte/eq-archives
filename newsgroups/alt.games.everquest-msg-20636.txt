Here you go chief, Rule number 6 of the naming policy:

"Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time
setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis,
Sloegin, Anyone)."

I think if Toaster is unacceptible, Vacuum or Vacuum cleaner certainly
would be.

Bit of a stretch, wasn't it? I think you completely avoided your own
point with that last sentence. But, just so you know, rule number 5
states:

"Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be
either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth
Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan)."

>  Show me the rule and too which VC is in violation :-)   didn't think so.

Let me refer you to rule #6 again:

"Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time
setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis,
Sloegin, Anyone). "

I made some good points, I think. I'm ready for your respect now. I've
quoted, verbatim, Verant's naming policy regarding the issues you
brought up. I have given you precedent, so I would imagine that your
argument at this point is moot. Please stop now, since this is really an
annoyingly boorish thread as it is.

I look forward to those of us who actually understand that I didn't just
pull these rules out of my ass to stop defending the original VC name,
since it has now been shown that it's a bullshit defense. Here's the
link to the naming policy, in case you don't happen to believe me:
