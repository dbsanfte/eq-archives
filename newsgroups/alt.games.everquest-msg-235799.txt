I dig that you want a specific theme/adventure out of your eq experience,
but im not entirely sure you can go to 65 on gnolls.. off hand the highest
level zone I can think of is karnors castle and you arent gonna get much
past 50 doing that. good luck on your gnoll slaying adventure though hope
you find good places to level up.
