Specifically what might help is what helped me...you go in that building and
you see a couple of NPC guards.  They're standing on either side of a
tapestry.  Click on that.

If the spells aren't on the next floor (I don't believe they are), go back
to the tapestry & click on it again...rinse & repeat until you find the
spells.
