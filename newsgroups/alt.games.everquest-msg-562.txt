You are taking a change like that WAY to personally.  They are not
"punishing" you for playing solo ... they are "rewarding" those that
group ( and my guess that was Verant's idea anyway ).  And before you
say that it's the same thing ... I assure you it's not.  They have not (
assuming they make the change ) removed ANY of your ability to aquire
experinece.  What they have done, is to add game balance ( in my
opinion).  Games need to be balanced.  If a druid was the "best" class
... then there would be whole servers full of druids, but instead there
is a high level of diversity.  Remember the theory behind a group : A
solo can kill 1 creature in the same time a group of x people can kill x
creatures ( this is generic, and I know doesn't hold true for some of
the tougher mobs ... this is meant to compare against the everyday
average mob ).  So the experience is *roughly* ( and I use that very
loosly ) the same ... the benifit being to the group side due to the
diversity and safety in numbers ( keep in mind that some mobs can't be
killed without being in a group.

I guess it really boils down to this: group or don't group.  The choice,
as it always was, is up to you.  Nobody is going to make you.

As far as the money is concerned .... I think it's an moot point.  Just
because you payed $9, doesn't give you the financial power to say to
Verant "Do this, or don't do that".  If you don't like the way the game
is evolving, QUIT!

My 2cp.
