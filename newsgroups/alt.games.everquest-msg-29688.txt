I have a Trueshot Bow and use 2/150 arrows which are nice and cheap, from a
Fleeting Quiver which reduces attack delay on archery.

I am hunting Crazed Ghouls in Butcherblock which are blue to me at 35.

I pull one clear of the spawn points and root, then shoot it until root
breaks, then re-root. I throw in the occasional Stinging Swarm which is good
for my Conjuration.

It takes me about 40 arrows to get it to 20% health, and I get on average
1-2 skill increases in archery. Then I finish it off with dual-wielded
piercing weaps which also gets my piercing up. They hit quite hard so I
often lose 20% health at this stage.

Most times I do 12-22 damage with arrows, occasionally criticals 45-51, and
occasionally less than 12 damage or missing altogether. My Archery is now
165, out of a max for my level of 180. My downtime is just medding to get
back the mana for rooting & DD, plus healing the lost health from the final
Melee.

I can just keep up with the spawn rate with this tactic, so it is quite
efficient.
