I loaded a couple utils I snagged from the Mandrake site, and also "altered"
a bit of the code in XP.  Good old M$ has put in some code to prevent
reading of some drive types.   (Little bit of the anti-competition thing?)
All I did was comment those lines out (17 in total).  You can find some of
this through trial and error, but unless you are an experienced programmer,
I wouldn't recommend it.  File reading and writing from XP to my Mandrake
partitions is possible, but it corrupts whatever file you change(possibly a
bit of code I missed.)

Sanity is the playground for the unimaginative.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.  And if you do.... Pictures!
