Your pet is lower level than you and is catching aggro. Park it near the Paineel
entrance and pull to it with Engulfing Darkness. Keep Gate memmed and watch your
pet's health (make a hotkey with /pet report health).

Possibly, but do you have Grim Aura and Vampiric Embrace up while you're
tanking? You should.

Raw silk is made by tailors with 36 skill, or those working their way up. Try
your server's auction channel - you'll probably be able to get it for 1 or 2pp
per AC per piece.

Do whatever's necessary to get Focus Death for your pet. If you're on Vazaelle
I'll go get it for you.

Try really hard to get groups. Your snare (Darkness) is a big asset to a group
in any dungeon, and tanks love it when you Siphon Strength the mob and Impart
Strength the tank(s). Don't summon a pet, though, you won't be able to give it
enough attention and it WILL wander off and cause trains.

Somewhere around 200. My 26 Gnecro went on a killing spree in the Warrens this
past weekend and is now Amiable to both Erudin guards and Paineel after killing
about 400 kobolds and turning in 8 molars in Paineel. To contrast, my woodelf
druid had to kill about 800 kobolds and turn in 24 molars to get his key to
Paineel, but he's Ally in Erudin.
