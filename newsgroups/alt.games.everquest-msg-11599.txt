Well after playing AC for over a year I found EQ. I would have to say that
EQ beats AC hands down.

While AC has a better graphics engine, at least from the standpoint of being
able to move the camera around your char more fluidly (and the vistas are
sweet). Everyone gets a sort of primative tracking in the form of a radar
screen. It has a continuous map of the world that you can run from one end
to the other with NO ZONING, in fact there are third-party utilities that
let track your movements across the entire AC world of Dereth. It even lets
you find your corpse when you die. So technically it has some advantages
(which I wish were in EQ btw)

EQ has a far better range of char to play, more races, more classes, way
better story lines and WAY WAY more quests.
Even thought AC lets customize you char more to make an ultimate adventurer
(for example everyone gets porting if they want) it is far more fun to play
EQ. The lore is more standard and recognizable and thus scarier in my
opinion. The variations of monsters fits on one page in AC while those in EQ
are, well, endless it seems.

So after playing AC for so long I feel I wasted my time there and was more
then happy to switch over to EQ when a friend at work showed it to me. I now
have 2 accounts so I can play with mey kids and over 4 chars that I play,
well regularly. :)

Even still, my ideal environment would be the new AC with the EQ storylines

Happy hunting
