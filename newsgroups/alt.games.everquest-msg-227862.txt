Oh you can try to disarm a trap that is not your kind.   But you'll pretty
much always set it off, and have a zero chance of success.... but you can
try.  : P

Basicly, heres what you do.  (Target the chest for all actions)

1) Type /inspect.  (Gives you a short description of the chest. No known
reason... if it's possible to match up trap type from the description, I've
never figured it out.)

2) Use Sense Traps button.   If this returns the result "You are unable to
determine if the chest is trapped"  then leave it alone.  It is not your
kind of trap.  My experiences do not match Adam's here.   I have never been
able to open a chest if I was "unable to determine."   If the result comes
back as "You are certain this chest is trapped" or "You are certain this
chest is not trapped" proceed to step 3.

3)  Use Disarm Traps button.   Use this even if you are certain the chest is
not trapped.   It is possible to fail your Sense roll and thus have the
wrong answer from it.  Using Disarm Traps cannot hurt you, since if the
chest is not trapped, nothing will happen.   If it is trapped and you did
not sense it, you can still disarm it.  (Important.  Do not try to disarm
traps if you are "unsure"  Doing that will automaticly set off a cursed or
magic based trap.)   If you fail to disarm, repeat until you succeed, then
proceed to step 4.

4)  Use Pick Locks button.  For this you must use the button.   Unlike most
other locks in the game, you cannot just drop your lockpicks on it.  If you
fail, repeat until you succeed.

5)  Type /open, then loot your "prize."

Swearing at SOE about risk vs reward is optional, but highly recommended.

A critical failure at any point will set off whatever trap it was.
Critical failures are pretty rare, but they do happen, even at 200 skill.



If the trap is magical or cursed in nature, you will not be able to do
anything on it.   Casters and priests will get upset and even start berating
you, but it is not possible for them to disarm the trap and then for you to
pick the lock after they do.   Any attempt to do so is an automatic "You
have failed to pick the lock."
