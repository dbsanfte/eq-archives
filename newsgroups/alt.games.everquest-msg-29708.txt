The other factor no-one's mentioned yet is quivers: which now reduce
the delay of your bow (by the weight reduction number on the quiver - a
20% WR quiver reduces your bow delay by 20%).  The holy grail being the
66% player-made fleeting quiver, which I'm told is a bitch to make.

A high level ranger with a fleeting quiver, a good bow (e.g. Bow of the
Huntsman) and Trueshot can be pretty devastating.
