Tripling it probably gives you a good start on estimating the number of
inactive raiders that might have active accounts.  In a game with a 6+ year
history, one has to assume that there are many many such accounts (a lot
that should probably be canceled that aren't).

This is true, partly.  My pocket shaman is on "permanent loan" to me for
instance.  But it's still unusual to find a raider that doesn't have
exclusive access to at least one more account.  The crossover with inactive
raider accounts is probably impossible even for Sony to estimate.

Actual people is meaningless to Sony.  Accounts, $15 per month, has meaning.

Yet you've just explained how it could.  My initial estimate is purely
active-today *players*.  Sony sees those players as the accounts they
control, which inflates the figure tremendously.

In my experience, of the people I have known, it's more like 7 or 8 out of
10 are inactive, taking into account the span of years.  The number of those
accounts are still being paid for I haven't a clue on.

If you haven't raided for a while (and you can't, to be complaining about
gear spread), then I can't see how you can consider that content as needing
to be "mixed up a bit".  It wasn't until PoP that we saw some true
creativity in raid encounter scripts after the initial batch of ideas had
all been used up.  GoD was where they actually started to get to the level
of variety and creativity in scripting events that is seen in DoN.

Only one that did them all regularly, the complaints about which trickled
down into the instanced game mechanics we have today.  Lots of guilds that
did Fear and Hate though.

Often a direct quote when people asked who was pulling and got that

True, but I'm talking about an earlier time than that.  There's no level 50s
to scavenge from when there's simply no level 50s at all.  =)
