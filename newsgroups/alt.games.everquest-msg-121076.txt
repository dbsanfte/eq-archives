Not really, the problem is that the average player/group lacks the
imagination to adapt their tactics to effectively use the tools at hand.
Your typical boring DL xp grind group simply can't see beyond the usual
tank+healer+damagedealers approach to combat.  Look at how incredibly
long it took for the player base to discover the power of AE groups.
I have seen a well played Wizard greatly increase the effectiveness
of an xp grind group.  But it takes a player who can stay on top of
the situation at all times, not just mechanically watch the mobs health
bar and stand to nuke at some prespecified level.  A group with a good
Wizard can have a lot more "fun" than the usual utterly uninteresting
chain-pulling xp grind where most everybody except the puller could
probably be handled by Lego robots /assiting and casting on a preset
schedule.

First, put away the crack pipe.

Now try actually thinking about what you posted.
Too hard?  Here, let me help with a little Q & A:
Q.  Why would a Wizard who was capable of doing 40-50% of the total
damage for a group of six (i.e. damage equal to, for instance, the
combined damage output of a warrior, a ranger, and a rogue) ever join
a group of six?
A.  He wouldn't.  Instead your hypothetical demi-god would partner
with a single self-healing tank (Paladin probably ideal, plenty of
others could handle the job in a pinch) and rake in the xp faster
than any 6 person group could ever hope to.

Oh, and one more thing.  It is not the warrior's job to take damage.
It is the MT's job to hold agro and endure the mob's attacks.  Warriors
excel at being the MT because:
1) properly played and equipped they are very good at holding agro,
2) only a monk is better at avoiding damage when agro'd,
3) their armor is the best at mitigating damage when hit, and
4) they have more hp than anybody else so that the damage they do
not manage to avoid hurts them less than it would another.
Warriors are also pretty fair damage dealers, when they are not in
a tanking role they can equip a high ratio two-hander and pump out
quite respectable damage, though less than an equivalently equipped
monk or rogue.
