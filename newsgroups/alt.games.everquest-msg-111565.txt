You can purchase meat.  You can only purchase bone chips if someone has 
sold them to the vendor.  Killing skeletons can take quite a lot of time 
if you don't have AE spells/songs.  I'm almost tempted to work on my 
Cabilis faction, since I've pretty much stopped hunting anywhere that 
hurts it now.  That and the fact that I have whichever one is affected by 
Sebilis maxxed ally.
