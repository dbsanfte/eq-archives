The horse head is an enormous pain for a cleric.

Imagine a pile of bodies at your feet.  You've just been rezed yourself, and
you'd love the mana regen of sitting while clicking bodies for the next five or
ten minutes.  But you can't freaking target any bodies, cause when you click the
horse makes you target yourself!

And you've grouped with some AGE lunatic body dragger monk who refuses to send
you tells with whatever bodies he's dragged in targetted, cause it might cost
him half a second per body dragged in.

Sigh, click horse off, target bodies, start clicking, and try not to dream of
the days when your horse was invisible if you put the old models on.
