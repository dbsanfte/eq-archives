I like soloing yellows/reds for fun with my druid, but I don't think
it'd be much fun waiting for a red-con HG to fall over.  If I just want
to see giants fall (and I have yet to tire of that) I can go to Kunark
and get half-adequate loot and better xp killing giants with half the
hp.  OTOH I think it'd be fun to get a small group together for HGs,
my druid with a tank or a Ranger and most anything else, adjust tactics
to suit the group.
