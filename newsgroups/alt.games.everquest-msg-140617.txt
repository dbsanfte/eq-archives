Ported into Grimling last night ... got dropped by the bank.  Merchants and
guards all around.  Much safer than CS or WL.

First time I ported myself into WL, three groups will killing Woushi by the
ring.  Popped in and was immediately hit by Woushi's AOE fear.  I'm 52 now,
and to this day I get a bad feeling whenever I head to WL. :-)
