This was a question about raids.  If you have a raid without enough healing
to clear through the yard trash without downtime, you should really pack it
in and head home, because the boss you're there for will eat you as a light
snack before lunch.

Aside from being single group again and not a raid, the situation sounds
pretty contrived to me.    Can you give any examples of a place where this
actually happens within the game?

I had a Skyshrine BP myself, which has the same heal with a slightly (1
second) faster cast time.  I didn't find much use for it other than for the
last little bit of healing after bandaging, when soloing greens for faction.
Even without AA, bind wounds was significantly faster than clicking the
breastplate.
