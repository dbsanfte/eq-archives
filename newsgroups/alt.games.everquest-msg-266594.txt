I decided not to buy EQ2 yet, since the open WoW beta started.  I'll play
that for a bit, and then when WoW launches, I'll decide which of the two I
prefer to do first (and also take into account which my friends are playing,
and where people from my old EQ1 guild are).

After one brief evening of WoW, the main thing that stood out compared to
my EQ2 beta experience is how in WoW I felt very much the same way I did
when I first started EQ1, and when I first played DAoC: I'm in a world, go
have fun.  In EQ2, it took around 10 levels to get past the "I'm just
following instructions" stage and start to get the "in a world" feeling.
