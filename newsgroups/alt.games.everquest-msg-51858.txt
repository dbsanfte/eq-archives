Absolutely true.  A profound statement.

> Your opinion does not make DAOC a better game.

Of course not.  I've never tried to say it did.  If you read through my
posts on this subject you'll see that I have consistantly and repeatedly
said that there are differences in DAoC that many will find appealing and
many will not.  *I* never made such a narrow minded claim, yet you seem to
be taking offense as if I did.  You're defensiveness leads me to believe
that you are one of the very people mentioned above.

I agree.

2.5 years.  Hmm... approximately 6 months after release?

Yes.  Me too.  Although my EQ account is still active because I will
probably play EQ exclusively for some time after the release of Luclin.

I agree.  EQ made it out of "beta" in about a year to a year and a half.

...DAOC is not.

Let's see how long it takes.
