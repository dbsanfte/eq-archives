<wince>  Oh, if I had a dollar for every such statement that was soon
followed by "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...."

Pick-up raids are SPAWNS OF SATAN!  And quite fun sometimes.  =)

Winning loot from raids is a matter of persistance and luck.  Show up to as
many raids as possible and eventually you'll win something... maybe.

Hehehe.

Terminology varies... on Drinal, it isn't called C3, it's called KEI.  I've
even heard that VoQ is called C5, which seems silly to me.  Almost reminds
me of a Rambo movie:  VOICES OF QUELLIOS:  Celerity, Part 5!

Always a fun experience.  =)

Oh my yes.  In my guild, we're constantly yelling at people to get to raids
faster.  Once I was in a group that wiped *just* as a raid was called, and I
spent the next few minutes doing the CR, rezzing folks, etc.  At the end my
guild leader was yelling at us because we weren't at the raid, and the fact
that we were finishing up a CR was a *barely* accpetable excuse.  =)

As you found out, having good pullers is important to any raid.

D'oh... that should have been checked for before the raid started.  Very
poor execution on the raid leader's part.

Get used to mobs like these.  As you progress in PoP, you'll find more mobs
that are initially untargetable but that, after some trigger event, become
targetable and thus killable.

Good thinking.  It's good you were willing to use the gems... I've had
chanters who have refused to Rune because it's too expensive.  I usually
don't stay in their groups too long.  =)

Plus you got some real-life experience out of it... you know what will
succeed on a raid and what won't - like having a monk puller and actually
checking that a mob is up before you even start the raid.  This will help
you out a lot as you creep up in levels and join more and more raids.

Thanks for the write-up.  =)  My only complaint... capital letters, neh?
