Lest this start the perennial "What about wolf faction?" thread: I have yet to
encounter a wolf that gave a faction hit. At level 31 and making a career of
tailoring, Rosewhite is STILL amiable to every wolf and bear in the old world
and kindly when in wolf form. As for the shame... the only shame is in letting
their deaths be in vain. For this reason, Rosewhite learned to bake and has been
known to hand out stacks of wolf sandwiches and beer braised bear (+2 STR, -1
INT when it is the first food item in inventory) to newbies.

I said that latter in my post, with the strongly worded suggestion that he NOT
sell them, no matter the temptation, if he has plans to continue tailoring. Best
to have a few stacks of free skins already banked when you are making tailored
backpacks for skill and profit than to find yourself wasting non-levelling time
farming bears or having to shell back out that money buying more.
