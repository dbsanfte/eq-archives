I think you might be getting confused, you have to jump off of 2
bridges to do the run to ChardokB (or come in the back way through the
levitation tunnel). It's doable withouth DA (or even gear) if you know
the way, you'll loose your adds on both jumps if you don't waste too
much time along the way. 

To get there, zone in (with sow up if possible) and hang a right
through the fort. Run down to the first bridge and jump. The room
below is safe with only a couple of non-agro mobs in it and you can
take a minute to heal up and re-invis before the train from up top
arrives. That room will have one exit, take that and then take the
first right down a side passage (right after you exit the room). Go
down that passage and then take the first left. go down to a T and
take the first right. Run down that passage, past a door (or two?) and
you'll get to an open area with 2 bridges. One straight and one to
your right. Jump off of the right one you'll be down by the waterfall.
Run past the waterfall and zone in before the trains catch up with
you.

Rgds, Frank.
