They don't have to, and that's what steams me the most about their lousy
name filtering.  Here's why:

First, the rules:

Replace A,E,H,I,O,U,W,Y with 0
Replace B,F,P,V with 1
Replace C,G,J,K,Q,S,X,Z with 2
Replace D,T with 3
Replace L with 4
Replace M,N with 5
Replace R with 6

Remove all zeros EXCEPT a lead zero.

Compress all double-numbers to singles, so, for example, 533 becomes 53.

Tack on enough zeros to make the number 5 digits long, or truncate to same.

Those are the rules for composing a soundex number (except that the soundex
rules keep the first character as a letter).

Legolas --> 4020402 --> 4242 --> 42420

Now, instead of having a big table of variations on Legolas, you need a much
smaller table of soundex numbers.  Take the name in question, convert to
soundex, and compare.

Leggolas --> 40220402 --> 42242 --> 4242 --> 42420
Legollass --> 402044022 --> 424422 --> 4242 --> 42420
Lhegholos --> 400200402 --> 4242 --> 42420
Legaless --> 40204022 --> 42422 --> 4242 --> 42420

Admitted, it gets more problematic with compound names, but this is a
solveable problem.
