Just curious if the zone crashed for other servers, but on Tarew Marr,
it is currently down, and all chars who are in it and logged on are
unable to move or chat with anyone.

I tried to log in to a char (thankfully, a rarely-played alt) that was
in PoK, and it said zone unavailable. My main was in the bazaar at the
time :)

So, is this relegated to one server, or is anyone else experiencing
this?
