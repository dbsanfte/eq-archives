1. Never "demand" anything from an individual that holds power over
you. You will just piss them off, and still not get what you want.

2. Not getting a "rez" is not the end of the world (even if you died
due to a bug). If the GM said no when you petitioned, then let it go.
If you push until you get suspended, you have only yourself to blame.

3. Banning should always be the last resort, and the GM gave the fool
every possible chance. He got what he wanted, and deserved.
