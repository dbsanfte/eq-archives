Yes I think it works very well indeed, BM, although it was a strange
concept at first!  I love it now though  :)  Even better, there's no
monthly fee.

On a more general note, pertaining to the main thread topic, I played
the demo of EQ2 and I found it fairly poor. I realize this was a demo,
but there is no way in hell I would shell out and buy EQ2 on the basis
of this crummy demo.

I wouldn't mind trying WoW out, but there is no demo currently
available in my region, as far as I know.  No way am I paying for the
game, then finding I don't like that either, lol.  The reason I am
wary of trying it is from the input of online friends (they have tried
WoW and EQ2, but cancelled their accounts and prefer to play either
Guild Wars/Anarchy Online and/or EQ) who say the game has more idiots
per square inch than in any other game they have ever played - sounds
a bit bitter to me, but there might be an element of truth to it, heh.
Several have also said it is FAR too easy to solo up to high levels in
Wow.  Still, I'd love to see a demo of it, to make my own mind up.

Until something else comes along, I'll stick to EQ, Guild Wars and
maybe some Delta Force Online.
