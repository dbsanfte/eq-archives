Heheh... At its prime, when I had a big apartment in Los Angeles, my home 
LAN consisted of three gaming PCs, a POS old FreeBSD box running the 
internet connection and an 8-year old Silicon Graphics workstation for 
email and news.

These days, I'm down to two connected PCs, and a few sad, languishing 
miscellaneous computers packed up in their boxes, waiting for me to move to 
a place with more power outlets (seriously, the fire hazard is what's 
stopping me from connecting more computers to the only electrical socket in 
my computer room).

Yeah, color me nerd, too...
