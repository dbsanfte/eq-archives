Then they should nerf KEI (and all high level buffs) for high level
types.  This would make the high end game "more challeging".  In fact,
most of the equipment that is out there should be nerfed as well.  It
would be much more challeging for a 60th level to defeat stuff using
rusty swords than Epic weapons.  This would make things much more
challeging and more "fun".

If every yahoo and their brother out there have epic weapons, it would
be hardly anything I'd look forward to.

What a LOAD OF CRAP you guys spout.
