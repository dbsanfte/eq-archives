OT. The sarnaks are the best with the sabertooth tigresses pretty good too. 
The sabertooth tigers are too high for your 27 charm song, so stay away 
from them unless you want to worry about your mana bar. The rhinos just run 
too darned fast and hit too darned hard. 

I swarmed the sarnaks and tigresses with my 27 charm song up to 44. I've 
also heard people talk about the ulthorks in EW.
