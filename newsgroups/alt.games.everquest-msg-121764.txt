UPDATE-
After about 10-15 tries to get in the game with the system, I finally
managed.  I have since getting back into the game reinstalled DirectX 8.1
and the newest drivers for the video.  I have no clue why it suddenly
decided to work, but it does.  The only real problem now is that when you
try to camp out of the game, the system hangs and I have to reboot the
system in order to get out of the game.  Thanks for all the advice and help
gang.
