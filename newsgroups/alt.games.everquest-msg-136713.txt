Sorry you will have to do a lot better to impress me. Almost any country
could be blurbed this way. The North Koreans did it quite well - it is
called picking out all the bad news and letting all that get through while
suppressing all other news; and do it real shallow. Nice try though. You
might want to visit the library too. Things are not as simple as you present
them.
Remember - "God is on the side of the heavy battalions."
