but like i said, i've got 4 alternatives to running.  also, i find that it's
usually stupid to run while in a dungeon anyways cuz there is usually know
way to avoid the monsters that you have to run past to get to the zone, so
alot of the time when you run you actually end up making things worse by
dying, getting out of range of the healer (who is probably chasing you down
trying to save your life and forgetting about the tank), and giving your
group more aggro and possibly killing them off too.  so an AA that
encourages you to run in these types of zones might actually end up hurting
your group, rather than helping it.
