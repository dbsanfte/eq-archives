Hmmm, I've known a couple of Warriors who were quite good at single
pulling.  You have to know where and how it'll work of course, but
so does a Monk who doesn't want to have to spend all his time lying
down on the job.  Nothing there a Mage can't do.

Us po' folk seem to hav trouble acquiring DD boosters, so for those
at least a Mage is nice to have around.

Coldstones are cool, how many other ways are there to get 5ac in
your ammo slot?  Not to mention the joy of ultravision of you're
a night-blind race.

Waterstones have fueled many a Kedge raid.  :-p

That would make them too useful, the only permanent focus that's as
hard to lay your mitts on as IH is DD.

And while you're at it, why don't my Paladins, Warriors, Druids,
and Ranger get slow either!  no fair!
