No! You don't have to!

This is true.  But he -does- have a right to be offended and do something 
about it, which I rather think he is.

}in the sand) will see it and maybe do something about it.  

You're missing the other side.  If Cox (whoever they are) dros it, then 
fewer people who might -not- be offended by it, and may find its 
commentary persuasive, will see it either.  One way to fight memes that 
bother you is to inhibit their propagation.

The other thing to note here is that Cox may not be aware they're carrying 
these groups, and may be more than happy to remove them if they are told.  
Just because someone wants to say something, the press is not -required- 
to enable that.  What if your favorite magazine got offered a large amount 
of money to add a 27-page color advertisement for the bigoted group of 
your choice in their August issue?  Would you -expect- them to print it?  
Would you even want them to print it?  Would you find the moral choice of 
their editorial staff a bit suspect if they took the offer?  Of course, 
you don't -have- to read it, but there it is.

}I can't think of one problem that was ever solved by people pretending it 
}didn't exist.  Well, maybe the sitcom "Joanie Loves Chachi", but no other 
}problems.

Hey!  I actualy liked "Joanie Loves Chachi".  I'm offended by that!  
Hmm...  I don't think it's really worth doing anything about it, though.

}By masking this problem, pretending it doesn't exist, and preserving
}yourself from being (gasp!) offended, you'll never do anything about the
}evil which offends you.  You find yourself motivated to do something,
}and maybe something good, but your answer is to remove the motivation.

And that would, in fact, be doing something about it.  What's your answer? 
to do... nothing?

Personally, I enjoy a good dose of hate-filled rhetoric now and then.  It 
can be damn amusing to tear apart their arguments in my head and remind 
myself exactly why I disagree with them.  Somewhere, I have stashed away a 
little collection of printed things that deeply offend me.  Once in a 
while, someone perusing my library will come across these and give me The 
Hairy Eyeball.  And then I have the positive joy of entirely agreeing with 
them, and it can prompt a discussion of exactly why these things are -so- 
wrong, and what's wrong with them, and what we can do about it.

But what's even better... is if some group I strongly disagree with is 
producing flyers or pamphlets that actually cost them money to print, and 
they're handing them out for free.  Why, I'd be -more- than pleased to 
help distribute a thousand copies or so.  I know a recycling bin that's 
very, very, interested in this sort of thing...

The only drawback is that then they think they have a larger subscriber 
base.  Sigh.
