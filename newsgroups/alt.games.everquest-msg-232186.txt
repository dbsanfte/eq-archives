This depends on the class and playstyle a lot.  As an enchanter I grab
one of these rings whenever I can because it makes a *huge* difference
in getting a broken charm under control again.  With it and BoR I can
almost always recharm before the stun wears off; without them I'm
definitely going to be taking a few hits and possibly failing to channel.

Of course I'm sure there are higher-end items that make it obsolete,
(ornate silk boots have the same effect, I think) but the ring's still
nice for those of us still stuck in pre-raiding limbo.  :-)
