    As far as I remember, they have four uses. One, as a turn-in item in the
Vex Thal key quest. Two, as a spell component in a necromancer 93% res
spell. Three, as a spell component in a necromancer lifetap spell (I believe
it's a 1000 point lifetap, but I'm not sure). Four, as a spell component in
a necromancer mana transfer spell.

    In terms of practical use, really only the first two happen. The person
sacrificed has to be between levels 46? and 59 inclusive, so usually twinks
get eaten. That's what happened when we keyed ourselves for Vex Thal - a few
select twinks got munched multiple times, and some other people bought some
in the Bazaar for 300 pp each.

    Yup.
