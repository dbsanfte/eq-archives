It's an interesting question, though. If yantis is selling this online you
could argue that he's representing that he has the legal right to do so. If
he doesn't have this right, that would seem to be a misrepresentation of a
material fact in connection with the transaction and sounds like fraud to
me. Why wouldn't this be fraud (in the tort sense)?
