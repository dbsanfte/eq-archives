AHHHHH. Damnit you flaming moron... Those are incorrect. You are completely
talking out your ass. Those figures are WRONG.

Those caps that are different in your list for sk and pally should be the
SAME. Somebody didn't update the list properly after the expansions and
patches.

Trying to set your moronicy aside, let me try and sort through this... Ok,
let's see. The only caps that are different (wrongly according to you) are
Defense and Hand to Hand (I'm ignoring your skill point caps for Lay Hands
and Harm Touch since those are irrelevant). Well i know for a FACT that
Defense on a sk can go higher than 230. I know for a FACT the sk defense cap
is 252 as I know someone that has that skill. You are flat out WRONG.

Hand to Hand I can't say for sure since who really cares? However I do
believe it caps the same as the pally (as is the case with all the other
skills).

So now how do you back up that a Paladin is better at tanking than an SK?
Please quit spreading FALSE rumors and devaluing a class (sk) to people
stupid enough to listen to you.

Sorry if I seem like an ass but it's completely annoying to be arguing with
someone who is using outdated and incorrect statistics to back up his
argument.
