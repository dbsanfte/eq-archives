Perhaps, but haven't run into it so far. The mobs with good loot also
stayed to fight to the death.

Sorry if I gave the wrong impression. Quite happy with the loot drops
given the horror stories we've heard from others. THus far, in three
evenings there, we've gotten:
One Master Wu's monkey stick
Two Wraithbone Hammers
Kunjar Ku'Jach (or however spelled.)
That obsidian ring with pluses to INT and Mana

That, along with all the normal crap that drops; runes, words, ruined
scale armor, spells, the odd gem.  Not too shabby and we're all gaining
exp. I got a little over a yellow each night in 45, for not terribly
long playing sessions. Pretty good from what I can tell. I may make it
out of hell by the weekend.
