I also play on Tunare, and I saw some guild chatter about
illusions not showing properly over the weekend. In particular I recal a
guildie complaining that his Illusion:DarkElf wasn't showing in TD,
and he also said that several other folk in the zone were experiencing
the same thing. But I don't recall seeing any GM announcements about it.
