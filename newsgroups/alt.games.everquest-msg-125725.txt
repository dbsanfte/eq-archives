I've duel boxed quite a lot now (usually 2, maximum of 3 chars at once)..

I also tried many combinations, and heres what I found

monk + cleric (60 and 60)  -  Best personal combo when Im in a pure exp
grinding mood (i.e pulling fast and continuosly). The other comp is behind
me, but I can easily pull however many mobs in Velk, then sortof feel my way
onto the keyboard and press my cheal hotkey.  My cleric is never below 80m
in Velks (pulling at a rate of 1spider per minute or so).. i MoR them, wish
it was easier to nuke/sit/nuke/sit though, make the most of that excess
mana..

monk + shaman (60 and 60) - I feel like the shaman is wasted at times.. this
has been my setup for the past few weeks (had to pharm evil dorfs in EW), my
shammy can buff, slow, dot (pox) and haste, but thats about it, well and the
occasional heal (torp).   Every few pulls he will be lom, and its a lil
tough to keep cannibalizing whilst trying to pull with my monk.

In a place like Kael bank, I perform equally as well with the cleric or
shaman.. in the arena, the shaman blows the cleric away.

monk + wizard (60 and 59) - This was quite a while ago, when some spiders in
Velks used to rip me apart solo (my gear is much much better now though)..
using this combo I managed to kill 2 spiders together, whilst either one
would probably kill me solo.   Built agro up on both, then ae'd, stunned,
draught (single target) etc.  Finished the fight with the wizard oom, the
monk all but dead.. but i won.

mage + cleric (53 and 60) - This was before the recent caster changes, so it
should be even easier now...  with aego, my pet becomes a real monster.  The
cleric chealing meant I didn't have to waste mana trying to heal it (or nuke
hard so the pet didn't die).. it was a very strong combo, I just don't enjoy
the mage like my monk.
