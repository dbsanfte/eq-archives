If you set up for melee by focusing on AC, weapon and defensive skills
porcupining can be pretty efficient.  I rebuilt one of my beta chars
when I created my primary druid, heavy on stamina balanced with good
agil and str for a half elf.  Rather than dumping all points into
wisdom, he is designed as a battle druid.  He still takes a hit dang
well in mid 40s, though with druid hp can't take too many of course.  

Target selection is also important, some things seem to hit through
leather better than others.  I found that at some levels I could nuke
kite faster than melee, later I switched to rotting which got me from
the early 40s to 46.  I think I was still playing with under 100 wis at
45 hehe, I love the challenge of trying to hunt CS single pulls with so
little mana.  Sure it would be easier to play a halfling with 200 wis
and quad kite, but for me at least it wouldn't be as much fun.
