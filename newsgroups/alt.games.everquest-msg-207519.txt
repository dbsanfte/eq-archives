Exactly the reason there is no "ultimate" duo. For every duo you can bring up I
can name a mob of the same XP level that each would fail at. That is why there
is no such thing as the ultimate duo. Pick a spot and anyone can tell you the
duo that can best utilize that spot. If you are asking to find out what you
should play then ask yourself where are you going to be hunting 90% of the time.
Then you will have your answer.
