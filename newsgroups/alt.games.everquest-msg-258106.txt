>is you do not like. 

top-post: n., v.
    [common] To put the newly-added portion of an email or Usenet response
before the quoted part, as opposed to the more logical sequence of quoted
portion first with original following. The problem with this practice is
neatly summed up by the following FAQ entry:

A: No. 
Q: Should I include quotations after my reply?

    This term is generally used pejoratively with the implication that the
offending person is a newbie, a Microsoft addict (Microsoft mail tools 
produce a similar format by default), or simply a
common-and-garden-variety idiot.
    One major problem with top-posting is that people who do it all too 
frequently quote the entire parent message rather than trimming it down to 
those portions relevent to their reply -- this makes threads bulky and 
unnecessarily difficult to read and arouses the righteous ire of 
experienced Internet residents (this style is called "TOFU" for "text 
over, fullquote under", or sometimes "jeopardy-style quoting"). Another 
problem is that top-posters often word their replies on the assumption 
that you just read the previous message, even though their perversity has 
put it further down the page than you have yet read. Oppose bottom-post.

See also the AGE FAQ, which of course, you already read before posting, 
for further pointers.

No, she's just on Ritalin.  I can understand your confusion, though.
