Now you've just got to get him to /ignore you ingame!

Reminds me how I felt about that jackass in the Grey finally telling me he
was /ignoring me.  If you ignore/plonk them, they keep yelling at a metal
wall, but when they plonk/ignore you, you can dance around them and laugh at
their idiocy without them noticing.

Damn, now I need to get more idiot people to ignore me ingame, time to start
cursing at everyone who asks me how much for Levitation when my auction
clearly says "WTB"!
