Stay away from the fiends - dang things give you spreading
crud - and you don't want to deal with that without cure
disease.  OTOH - the shiknar outcasts are completely overlooked
by folks fighting over bandit camps - level 15-17 and not too
tough a kill - easily single pulled in an area with NO adds
at all.  To get there from the Hollow shade entrance, run 
down to the first lake - turn right (if you can sneak, you
can just sneak behind the fiends - otherwise camo in Hollowshade
and bust past them), take the first tunnel to the right, once
there you will be in a non-aggro section again.  go to the Y
and turn right - just down there is the first Shiknar Outcast,
take him out and proceed to the T - there are 2 shiknar here,
pull the closer one on the right from a distance, and he will
come alone - take his partner, then up that tunnel, over
the top of the hill are 2 more - again, pull the nearer one
first, and he will come alone.

You should really hook up with a healer - there are a couple
more down the main tunnel, for a total of 7, EXCELLENT xp
for a duo of 16-22's.  7 mobs, easily single pulled on a 
5 minute timer with no chance of adds - and almost no-one
ever even comes by, even at peak times, so keeping the camp
is no problem.  There are also sediment Delvers and shrooms 
in this tunnel segment - incase you get a group going that
makes too easy a work of the shiknar.
