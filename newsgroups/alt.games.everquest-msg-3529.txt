True.... I accept the criticism. I never have seen a newsgroup die in a
flamewar.

So far, this doesn't seem to have affected the information output of this
group, it seems to be merely a sideline for some who wish to participate.

The other groups you mention seem to be ripe for extreme points of view, but
alt.games everquest?..... seems to be a struggle of egos, not opinions.
