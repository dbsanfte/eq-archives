They seem to have limited it to cities where you can "start out" plus the
nexus, Great Divide, and the Overthere (I may have missed one).

To me, the "Obvious" places missed are:

Katta
SSeru
Highhold

Katta and Highhold Keep are the ones that most astound me since they are
both several zones from another PoP point (OK, HH is only 2 zones away from
RV, but one of them is Kithicore - not a fun place for low level travelers).

If the motivation was to truly simplify travel, the Katta and NK/SK seem the
obvious missing places. CS would also be a candidate, except that messes
with the Key to Cobalt Scar quest too much.
