Got lots of answers...unfortunately only one person actually tried to answer
the actual question. <g>  Not complaining, this is Usenet.

Anyway, my level 52 druid successfully Lesser Succored himself and my level
56 enchanter, so there seems to be no level restriction (yet?).

Mana cost is less (as well it had better be, considering you don't get
regular Succor for another 39 levels!), and casting time is longer (10.25 as
opposed to 9.00).

If there are any other differences I have yet to notice them.
