I was looking over the EQ2 site and saw the bit about Teamspeak and was 
quite interested.
I am completely ignorant of the software and was hoping I could get some 
Idea of what to expect .
There are two minimum requirements one for client and one for server.
What would I be? What is the difference between the two?
Any other info on the software would be most appreciated.
