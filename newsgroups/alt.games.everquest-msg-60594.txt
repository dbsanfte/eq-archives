If you die in Kael along the main path, CR is trivial.
If you die in Kael not along the main path (ie., past see invis mobs),
CR is a pain thanks to draggro.

Just remember, the two named frost giants (Tombkeeper and
Toxi-somethign) in Wakening Land does see through invis and will harm
touch your butt.  You have tracking so use it and make sure you keep
clear of them.  

Rolandal the quest dragon a bit further along the wall towards
Skyshrine doesn't see invis.  However, if you aggro in (ie., invis
dropped at the wrong time), expect to die fast (get a /loc).  He's one
of those annoying dragons that procs ChaosBreath (1200+ hps DD gravity
flux).
