I"ve gotten many many requests for SOW as a dwarf cleric who
doesn't go anon.  Not only are Some dwarves not druids or
shaman... none of us are.  If it was a request for clarity I could
vaguely see the possibility, I MIGHT be a chanter using
illusion dwarf for some reason.  But SOW?  I was so happy
when I got to 49 and could at last indulge them, funny how
not one of them actually meant Shield Of Words.
