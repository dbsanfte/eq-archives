seems like a big waste of rune, if your not confident of killing her i guess
its best to be safe though

yep

its a lot easier (faster) to pull her out of the room, tho if she gates you
can have a problem.

my guild pulls her to the library, didn't bother with rune or pre heals on
the inc or DA, just go full offensive when she gets there.  have 1 warrior
taunting with a cleric to heal him (melee damage wont be much of a problem)
then either have every single person nuke (including clerics) or If you have
a lot of lower level people (not much in the way of resists/hp) I guess
group heals would be usful (paladins arent the only ones with group heals
btw)

last time i killed her, i took about 1k damage though the whole fight, which
was 2 ae's (which was as long as she lived)

If she has 22k hp (it may well be 18), you can have a rough idea how fast
she will die....

before i upgraded to fist wraps (ST weapons) i parsed a short burst of
damage at 200dps (as a 60 monk with no buffs, epic and item haste) so if
every monk there discs, thats about 2400 damage each in 12 seconds.. 4
monks, thats 9600 damage.  Cant remember if you need lures to hit her (never
used my wizard for the fight) but a 60 wiz is going to be doing anything
from 600-3k damage a nuke.  Rogues will prolly at least equal monks in
damage (wont get much time to position for backstabs etc) warriors offensive
disc, sk's HT, every other melee, plus all those nukes (you should have an
idea if you know what your raid crew is going to be)

if you have enough offensive to kill her within 4 ae's (people are gonna
start dieing fast at this point) then your plain sailing

key thing is to make sure its a clean solo pull, and you pull with plenty of
time before mobs repop
