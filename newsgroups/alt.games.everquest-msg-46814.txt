A friend and I have been hunting willowisps in WK on and off for a few days.
I'd guess we've killed around 20 of them (we're hunting other stuff too) and
have so far looted only one GLS and one regular lightstone.  All the rest
have dropped burned-out.  Another friend says he read somewhere that Verant
changed the wisps in the last patch, making GLS a very rare drop.  I've only
hunted wisps in WC before, with an older character, and am used to getting
several lightstones a night and Greaters maybe a third of the time.  Anybody
else know anything about this?  Is it just my bad luck?  Thanks for whatever
info you all have!
