Uhm, Dan, your main is an enc? You have 2 friends who want faction too?

AoE Droga. I did it to get salts for the 9th ring.

Me puller, 60 rng, 60 dru, 60 enc, 60 wiz.

I left with 60 salts for my poison, everyone else left with many more
stacks of the junk... Harm touchers are a bit mean there, so you run
out, gather 15, bring em back, chanter AoE stuns to hold em, you get
a heal from the druid/cleric, run out, get another 15, bring em back,
run out, get the final 15, wiz druid and enc unload with mad nukes,
you giggle insanely at the carnage, and then move to another spot because
there's no goblins left alive within a 4 minute pull range ;)

If you want faction on an alt for CR so you can still level up there, just
add a level 12 enchanter to the group with a sceptre of insidious whatever,
the alliance click stick. Oh and take a cleric to revive them when they
get aggro from being low level and there being 45 mobs about ;)

Just make sure your puller doesnt have a propoensity for getting lost
in a maze of twisty corridors, all alike ;)
