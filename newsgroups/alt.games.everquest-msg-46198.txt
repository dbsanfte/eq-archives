When you get an appropriate level, hit Dreadlands. Exp and silk from
drachnids. Ok, so they have sow speed and ranger spells, but they can
be killed in groups and later solo. Also, emeralds are a random drop
from all the mobs.
As for my smithing, I am going to work it up to 115 before beginning
to make studs, and I already have a Fier'dal sewing kit.

>Oh, and you cant farm greenies in Warsilik for oak bark, its foraged there too *S*.

/bonk 
Obviously, I'd forage while looking for the iksar bandit lord or
something like that :)
