If you don't want to cheat or hack the game - then don't use MacroQuest.

It's both those things in one handy package - apparently.

I've never used it, but I've read the scripts that get posted to various 
websites, and yes, if you wanted to cheat it could play a cleric for 
you.  It's against the EULA, it's 'cheating' and in a multi-player game 
it's plain wrong, IMO.
