ALright got a gear-realted question, becuase It's hard to find actual
in-game pics of some of these items


I have a Cleric who just hit 51.  For the last while I've had a Crypt
Robber's Gem, which is a primary -only item with Spell Haste II and
some stats.  It's one of those items that look like a blinking light
around the hand.

I'd like to find something similar to put in my Secondary slot, so I
was wondering if someone could suggest some items with a similar
visible effect.  I think at 51 it might be time to ditch the Skull of
Jhen'Tra.

Thanks muchly,

--sugarman--
