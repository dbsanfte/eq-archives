Hmm, melees including a monk really don't have an effective way of
doing that since npcs regen FAST, like SUPER. He'd probably regen
nearly as fast as you making it so there was no way you could solo
him.

The only ways to solo him really are with fear and if you are a melee
type who can fear trying to solo it you better have a ton of mana and
pack a lunch.  If you don't use fear the only way is a druid with ES
vambs or a velious bracer, or perhaps a shaman with that DD bracer, or
of course higher level pet classes or a necro. 

Even my 55 druid would not find soloing him worth it though, it would
take a long time and not be very rewarding in terms of xp or
money/treasure (unless he dropped a bd maybe or several diamonds) If
it took my druid a long time it would take you forever. 

Go for it though and say how it turns out ;)
