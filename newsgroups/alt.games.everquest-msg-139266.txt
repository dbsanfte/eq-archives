Eh, tried the hide sneak and it worked until he saw through hide.  But 
then he's blue to me at 35 so I just ran away and came back and handed 
him more muffins.  Boring but nice faction work.

Now if only I could figure out what those !#$!#@ merchants want.  I've 
tried the notes to rebby and janam but dammit, I am getting REALLY sick 
of the run back and forth, and my faction with the merchants doesn't 
appear to have budged, even though I did the notes run once before so I 
could train in the Freeport sewers.  Rogue trainer and her cronies are 
now amiable, yet nothing from the merchants.  Bah.
