Suppose SOE added the following to the game (knowing SOE, sold as a no drop
item from some merchant available only in the next expansion):
 + A potion of heroism for 1,000pp that raises any character below level 10
to level 10 (and raises all combat/casting skills to 40).
 +  A poition of greater heroism for 10,000pp that raises any character
between levels 10 and 25 to level 25 (and all combat/casting skills to 100).

Would this be a good thing or a bad thing? With the right friends, it's
fairly trivial to power-level someone to 25 in a few hours, though it
probably isn't a lot of fun once the amusement value of watching orcs
disintegrate as they hit the damage shield goes away.
