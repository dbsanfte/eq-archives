Glad I have alts in grouping range of my friends.

This is the dumbest thing in world - EP is near useless *except* to pet
canni for people who don't have Rathe's Son.  Give me my AA back.  While
you're at it give me my AA for QS back - I really don't give a shit if
I can CoH a second faster or if I summonf F'ing food a second faster.

I understand jumping does run off endurance - swimming doesn't, swinging
weapons doesn't.  Don't know about starving (yet)

Very good news to shaman and necros - since their new curse dots are
5 ticks.

Supposedly the newer particle effects put less demand than the old
ones.  That being said, having been playing a bard again - my screen
can get overwhelmed.  My framerate doesn't drop, but you can't see
anything through the swirling colors.

You used to still be able to pet-canni with IRE - since it was based on
mana *before savings* you could get 120mana per reclaim from G-Voc 
pets.  63 fire became very useful for those folks - no malachite needed
and the same cost/cast time as G-Vocs.

According to tests on test - with IRE you net a 1% loss every cycle - 
so these new percentages are *after* the savings.

Pet focus items - Diamond Prism of Companionship (effect Summoner's
Boon), Gloves of Dark Summoning (Ritual Summoning) and a time level
medallion (Minion of Darkness)

So, besides outside spoilers, how are young players going to know not
to waste their plat on completely useless things like Jig (which was
only kind of useless before).

I hope it's new code that determines buyback price by checking the cost
of the elements used to make it in the database.  That way there won't
be any loopholes for the macroer's to turn into plat.

Openings are strictly for Melee (not hybrids).  The only thing that
hybrids are going to have to worry about with the new system is buying
their discipline tomes in EC.

Time to focus on leveling my BL - at 58 he's in range of being able to
push to 65 very quickly.
