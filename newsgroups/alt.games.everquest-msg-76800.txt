LOL... that's a pretty broad question for a game as complex as EQ.

Depends on what Race/class you want to start out with.... Speaking from
my exp, I have a few suggestions.

1) WoodElf Druid. Put all stats points into Wis and remaining into Dex.
I realize that a Halfling Druid is much better stat wise, but WoodElves
start in Kelethin which is a more populated area and there are more ppl
to help there and lots of higher levels visit there and tend to buff and
help newbies more.

2) Troll Warrior. Ogres may be stronger, but Trolls stats are more
rounded. Put a few points into str and sta to round them up... I think
to 120, 120. then put the rest into Dex, since you'll crit more and proc
more with weapons that have a proc. The Innothule swamp is a great
starting area, not much help will come to you from other players, but
the starting area can't be beat. If you stick around the "pond" in front
of the zone, the guards are close by and you'll get to lv 5 in short
order.

3) Human Monk. Haven't played one, but they are  great tanks and awesome
pullers once they get FD. I'd prolly start 'em in FreePort too.

4) Halfling Rogue. Put most points into Dex and rest into Str. Halfies
start with +50 Hide and +50 sneak. You click Sneak till it tells you
that you're as quiet as a mouse, and then Hide till it tells you that
you've hidden yourself from view.
Then you can go exploring. Once you attack something, or pickup
something, you'll be visible again and have to renew hide. At lv one, I
was able to take my Halfie Rogue all the way to Thurgadin in Velious,
LOL... took me over 4 hours but was a great adventure. Rogues are great
for exploring.



Zoomorfius Fleetfoot, lv 31 WoodElf Druid.
Picknoze Foebasha, Lv 26 Troll Warrior.
Nightwatch of Norrath, Saryrn.
