My husband has never been able to play the game because of headaches and
nausea.  If it just started it might be that you have some kind of inner ear
problem from allergies or sinus infection that's causing problems.

Getting your eyes checked too might be a good idea.  Astigmatism causes
headaches more than other eyesight problems.
