That was a long post string and I would like to sweeten the air a little.

I recently bought some (expensive) items in the bazaar.  The seller had two
almost identical sets of items, one for my diety and one for another diety.
I bought several of the right items and one wrong one.  The seller saw the
mistake when he checked his mule and two days later mangaged to contact me
and replace the bad purchase with a good one.

Integrity still rules....
