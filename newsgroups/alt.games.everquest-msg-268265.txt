Yes, it did.    Seriously.  Sean has posted the formula at times, I forget the
exact amount, but killing something 5 levels below you is more than *double*
the exp of killing something 6 levels below you due to the bonus.  And it goes
up by about 12% for every level higher than (Your level -5) that the opponent
is.   Once you get used to that... killing ultra low blues *seems* like it's
ultra slow.

Enchanters could go to Sebilis, charm one of the frogs near the entrance, buff
the shit out of it... and it would solo entire rooms full of 45 - 47 frogs.
Since they were all blue, they were raking in the exp.  They would kill a bit
slower than a group, but they would keep all of the exp, and so make 5x as
much per kill.

To understand, you have to keep in mind that back then we had different ideas
of what "good" exp was.   Our group would pull in an AA per night and think we
were doing great.   An enchanter DC soloing in sebilis or HS would get twice
that.  2 AA's per night.

Now with OOW and the group bonus, and the high con bonus, 5 AA's per night is
a "good" night for our group.   Enchanters that stay pegged at 60 can still
get thier 2 per night in Seb... but it sucks now, because of the comparison.
It's now slower than a group, instead of faster.   And soloing high blues
without DC (since a DC pet would get owned on them.) you can solo near the
group rate.  Or at least higher than the (level 60 doing low blues) rate.
