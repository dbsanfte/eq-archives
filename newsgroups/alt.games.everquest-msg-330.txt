Right, this is why I said there should be some sort of a cartography skill.

So if you use it and I use it and I am willing to bet 95% of the people
that play use it don't you think it just MIGHT be vital basic game information?
Just maybe? Nah.

I didn't say I wanted "exact" maps did I? I want the mapping to be done
in game like other RPGs that did it well. Those games I am refering to did
not include 'exact' maps either and I don't want 'exact' maps. Games with good
auto-mapping like the Ultima Underwolrd series were awesome. Also, the Might
and Magic games had fine auto-mappers.

Those games were a wee bit simpler and a hell of allot smaller than EQ.

And how many of those people whould have hated the game if an
auto-mapping feature were included?

If they were as accurate as the EQ map in the box, they'd be useless.
Luckily most maps in ancient times were EXTREMELY useful. But also
this is a game, we don't have to follow reality.

Anyone that has the techno savy to program a "SEVERE" cheat would already
be capable enough to bypass the anti-alt-tab.

We are talking about a fantasy game here not medieval times.
We have magic spells and dragons etc. I'm sure some wizard
by now would have come up with a mapping spell. Hell they
already have magical teleportation spells a map spell should
be a cakewalk.

Oh yeah and I'm sure you map with "a pen and paper"
every zone you go to right?

An auto- mapping feature would do nothing but enhance this
already great game game and make it much more enjoyable
to play. It would also help to eliminate all those stupid location shouts
"what's the LOC to Karnor's?" "Which way from FV to DL?"
"where is the warriors guild?" "how do I get out of this town?"
