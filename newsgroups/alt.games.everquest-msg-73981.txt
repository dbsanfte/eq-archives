May I ask why you feel that way about the banks? (just curious) Personally,
I like the fact that I can go to any bank to get out whatever I have in
there. I suppose it would add a more realistic touch to the game, though, if
done that way. I certainly can't go to Citizens Bank and expect them to have
my money or anything else from Security Federal.

As I said, I was just wondering.

Thanks for playing.
