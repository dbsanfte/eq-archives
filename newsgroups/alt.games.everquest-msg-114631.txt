No. It's usually a character dedicated to holding the guild's plat and
items or some combination of that and a more nebulous concept.

In the case of my guild, it's a level 29 mage I don't feel like
playing any more who now stands in the tunnel in EC with about 1,000
stones in coins and gear on him plus a couple of mules made just for
holding spells or buying peridots, plus we will often say things like,
"I have a multiquest of Skyshrine chain greaves in the guild bank,"
even though the item is on my main.
