Turns out if you go into options, you can turn the sound down on several 
different sliders.  Turn them all off, however, and there's one sound 
you can still hear, audio triggers.

This means I was able to set up an audio trigger for the word yawns, and 
  every time a mob is slowed near me, I hear a little sound; don't have 
to listen to the rest of EQ noises, nor do I have to try and sort it out 
from them.

This makes a big difference on the Willsapper; I was unable to sort the 
line out from a large stack of other spam, me proccing, me casting 
normally, and everyone's DOTs landing, all seem to be included in 
"spells Mine"

Now I can swap in Willsapper, and when the noise goes off, either swap 
back to my regular weapon, or switch to the next target if I'm tanking 
multiple mobs.

Its the same message as other people's slows landing, of course, I can't 
tell whether its mine or not... but the fact is, I don't really care 
who's slow landed just as long as someone's did; if it wasn't mine, then 
it was almost certainly better than mine, and I can switch because mine 
is no longer needed.

Grouping though, I've Willsapper is often landing within a few seconds 
of engaging while caster slow sometimes takes upwards of 30 seconds 
while they malaise/tash and wait for aggro loc and perhaps get a resist.

With the Willsapper plan, I'm using a shield, which improves my 
mitigation, until SOME slow lands, and then swapping in for higher DPS.. 
without the audio prompt, this was pretty problematic.

Now that I know this works this way, I'll think about putting in some 
other prompts
