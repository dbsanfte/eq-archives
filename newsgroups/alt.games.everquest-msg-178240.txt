Incorrect, Kaev.  I merely pointed out the obvious: if you keep
paying for something, regardless of quality, there is a lot less
incentive for the company that supplies the good or service to
improve the product or service.

Does that simple logic elude you?

: No doubt.  Bitter people often cling to their misconceptions.
: Especially bitter people who are trolling.

I'm glad you recognize you're a bitter troll.

: I disagree.  So do quite a lot of other people (you remember those
: hundreds of thousands of subscribers?) including SOE themselves
: (see the text of the Jan29 patch message elsewhere).

Yep, SOE is very, very sorry.  And they were sorry last time, too.
And the time before that.  Yes.  Very, very sorry.  Oops, we did it
again.  Tee-hee.

: LOL.  That takes the cake.  You try to put words into the mouths of
: hundreds of thousands of people,

Oh, Kaev.  Just because you keep saying it, doesn't make it true.

: and then when I point out words that
: are much closer to what most people are saying you accuse me of
: putting words into your mouth?  Here's a clue for you, troll boy:
: You're the one trying to put words into other peoples mouths here.

Oh, Kaev.  Such a predictable little troll, you are.  I make an
obvious observation, and you try to twist it around.  Good try.  :)

: Your troll is rather lame, it's tripped and fallen off the bridge,
: and it doesn't look to know how to swim.

*Yawn*  Boring and unfunny, even by your low standards.

: Well, it's hardly a shock to me that a bitter ex-EQer

tsk tsk.  I'm not a bitter ex-EQ'er, but I *am* an ex-EQ'er.

I even miss the game in many ways, but unfortunately, my playing
style (an hour here, an hour there) doesn't match the game
design very well.  I very, very much enjoyed the game while I
played it, but I got burned out.

Does that make me bitter?

Oh, wait, I forgot: you like to put words into other people's
mouth.  Good job, trollboy.  :)

BTW, if you're ever interested in why I left EQ, feel free to
ask, I'm pretty sure I'd take the time to answer.  It's not
because I'm bitter, though I *am* dissapointed in SOE in several
ways.  But I did enjoy the game -- a lot -- while I played (at
least before I got burned out).

: trolling a.g.e.
: cannot recognize logic when it bites him in the nose.  Sorry, no
: score for you this time Ed.  Zilch, nada, nothing.

I'm sure your mother feels there's no excuse for you, too.
