Verant messed rogues up. It went something like this at the designers
meeting:

Designer1 - "Oh, we dont have time to implement rogues properly, how many
locked doors should we have in the game anyway?"
Designer2 - "Oh i forgot.. there's nothing to steal in the game either, coz
our code prevents thieving..."
Designer3 - <snigger> thinks to himself the cool code he made for moving
traps... :-)
Boss - "Oh blast.. just beef their melee skills up so they'll shut up, or
we'll nerf them and then they'll talk about that instead".
