: Lake of Ill Omen.  You can catch different pounds of fish and even
different

five

: need to buy a tackle box (four container, tiny), you can only buy it at a
: vender in Feerott or in Ocean of Tears (Brother Island), this is also
where
: you can buy hooks (Circular, Dry, and Treble Hooks).  Combine a hook, some

: your own bait!  They just made it so that you get a bonus using your own
: lures.  Here are some recipes:
