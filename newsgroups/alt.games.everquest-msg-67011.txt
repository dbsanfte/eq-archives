I have a Matrox Millenium G200 AGP video card, a Pentium 2 - 350MhZ and
128 MG SD RAM.  Everquest has always worked on my system up until Luclin
came out.  I have not purchased it, however.  Ever since Tuesday evening
when the massive patching ended, Everquest has failed to load, stating,
"No 3D graphics card detected."  Everyday, since then, I have downloaded
the new patch, crossed my fingers, and hoped Everquest would load. 
Every day, the same result, "No 3D graphics card detected."  I have
downloaded DirectX 8.1, and I have reinstalled my video drivers, but
nothing seems to work!  I am becoming very frustrated.  Can someone
pleeeeaasse help???

Josh
