Well, one advantage to true newsreaders then... in Agent its
control-k. Voila, never have to see him again, ever. As far as I would
be concerned (this is hypothetical, I haven't actually killfiled him)
he really isn't here - I don't see his posts, don't see him posting,
and only ever know if he's blathering on if someone replies to him.
The ultimate in /ignore.

And THAT galls trolls more than anything. :-)
