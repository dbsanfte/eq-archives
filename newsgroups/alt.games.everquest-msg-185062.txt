I just got the PoP expansion a week ago and it's well worth it.  My Char is
only level 23 but able to take advantage of the travel.  If you look around
the cities you will see a lectern with what appears to be an open book on
it. By clicking on the book you port to the PoK.  You don't have to be of
high level to do this..I was level 5 when I first tried.  Anyway, in the PoK
you will find many stones that port you to the destination etched on them.
I have been hunting in The Overthere lately. Being a DE and given the Neriak
and T.O stones are close to each other in the PoK travel is a breeze.  Don't
know much about horses though I saw a stable at the Bazaar and assumed you
could buy them there.
