It confuzzles me.  I realize my paladin isn't a warrior.  She'll never hit
as hard as a warrior, she'll never have the HP that a similarly equipped and
leveled warrior will have.  Frankly, Paladins and SK's aren't "main tanking"
classes, just as druids and shamen aren't "main healing classes."  None the
less, all four have things they can bring to the table.
