I remember the day well, because it was the day I finally joined my guild
(who I'd been raiding with for a while) I don't remember exact level
though... 54-56 at a guess

I haven't actually killed him since i made 60

Hah i remember when my magician made level 35, and i went back to Crushbone
to kill D'vinn.. I ended up having to gate, cuz I had 3 mobs on me and
couldn't get the agro onto my pet.

No I don't laugh at people, they had the same struggles that I had when I
was in their situation.

I remember my mage getting killed several times in OT at 35, to the point of
severe frustration.... I also remember my SK soloing there at level 17

Nope, another bad assumption.
I've been on a pickup raid of 50+ people that failed to Gore.. (perhaps
understandable due to pickup..)

did i complain?

Anyway, im sorry for giving my opinion that Fay was a gimp, in comparison to
other "dragons"
Remind me to never say that IMO Statue is an easier kill then Vindi, and
Yeli is an easier kill then Sontalak
