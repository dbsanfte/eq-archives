I went for the cheapest Drogmor based on others comments about the
head getting in the way of targeting.  It is excellent for mana regen
when stationary without the agro effects of sitting, but for movement
it is hopeless.

When running it doesn't go quickly (run 3 is faster), it takes a few
steps to get upto speed & then its not the smoothest ride.  If you get
seasick easilly donet get a leezard.

I use it a lot when I'm grouped in places like BoT & PoE where theres
not much moving around involved so I can sit for a while & swap spells
without getting beaten on too much. I've not targetted it accedentally
except when trying to loot - then it can be a pain.

The drawback, other than the speed, is that you can't mount up whilst
in illusion form unless its a playable race.  Most of the time I'm
illusioned as either scarecrow or scale wolf - have to remeber to
click it off before I mount up.  Oh & they eat your lunch too - worth
bearing in mind it you use expensive food (hero sandwich / misty
picnic basket etc)
