Yes you can level pretty fast .. You will find as you progress that
good groups will chain pull .. the puller will be a bard or ranger  ..
they will pull mobs to the group the tank will get aggro at 3/4 health
the puller will go to get the next mob .. this means you have a
constant stream of mobs inc .. the tactic is normal for good groups.

BTW being an Aussie like you which server are you on? .. I am on
Bristlebane (been around too long in this game)
