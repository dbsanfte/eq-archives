I did the new weapon quest for the druid there in surefall.  It's like a
normal scimitar, magic, no drop, sta +1 WIS + 2.  Nice.  The mob you need to
kill to get the head is about 15 or so.  You have to sharpen the sword which
means in surefall a run to erudin for the sharpening stones.  The boat and
the raft out there are out of sync so if you don't have port yet, use
luclin.
