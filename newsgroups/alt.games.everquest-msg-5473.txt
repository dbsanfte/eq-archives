This must vary, not only from server to server, but also according to what times
you play. My schedule gives me the fortunate opportunity to often be able to play
around 3 p.m EST.  On our server around that time, when I was running my monk in
there,  I found more often than not that we were lucky to be able to get five or
six folks of the approriate level for a guard room group, and rarely did anybody
get a successful Warrior room group going until later in the day/evening. A
couple of times I had to get on a waiting list for the guard room, but both of
those days the lookout room was blue so we camped that until openings came in the
guard room.
