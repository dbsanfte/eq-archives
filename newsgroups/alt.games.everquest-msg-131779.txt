First, this is in South Africa. Second, Africa is a continent where more
than 1/4 of the population is infected with HIV. Third, this is a great way
to educate childred early on two points: 1) that people with HIV are not
inherently evil, and 2) that it exists, is out there. This awareness will
hopefully help them, once grown up, to be more responsible about this issue.

Furthermore, if this were in North America, I may have agreed with you, that
this is an unnecessary step that takes the naivite out of children's lives.
But even so, given how unfortunately horrible and preventable the situation
in Africa is, maybe we need to be changing the way we raise kids, because
this generation sure as hell aren't, on the whole, doing anything but
contibuting to this tragic problem.

This is not the 50's anymore, and we cannot treat the world as if it is.
