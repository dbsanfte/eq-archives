Not at the end-game they don't.

Our tanks have 6500hps or more. With raid buffs I have 4200hps and I'm
a *druid*. Nature's Touch heals 978 points. I cannot heal rampage
victims. In some cases I can't even heal my party's AE damage  (ask me
about Hoshkar sometime).

Tank_01 tells you, 'Help me! I've taken 5000 dmg!!!'
You tell Tank_01, 'Consent me'

Raids have been called off because only 3 clerics showed up. With the
implementation of the 75% "cheal" the absolute and total dependency on
large numbers of clerics for high-end mobs will be lessened. The
clerics' role as the most important class on the raid is still
guaranteed. 

I think 54 is way too low for the new cheal spell, but perhaps Verant
is trying to help out the lower end guilds so they can be viable in
PoP. The biggest problem with the new spell is that clerics will have
a much harder time grouping from 54+. This is a pretty severe problem
and the new cleric spells on test don't seem to address or alleviate
this issue.
