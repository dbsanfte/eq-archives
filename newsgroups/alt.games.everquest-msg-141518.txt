 Bear pet is very handy for tradeskill farming and faction on greenies.
Not exactly a money waste unless you do neither of those. If all you're
doing is Root/Dotting or quad kiting for hours on end then yeah, you may
not find this spell useful. I was never a big fan of charming and would
rather have the bear pet as opposed to recharming a mob, assuming I
could find an animal in that zone, every 4 minutes.
