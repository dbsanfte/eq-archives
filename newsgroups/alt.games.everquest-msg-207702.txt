Yesterday I figured out who the NPC quest givers were for the new
newbie armor quests for Ogres, Trolls, Barbarians and Erudin Erudites
(Iksars still don't have newbie armor quests), plus the items needed
for the various armor pieces, and wrote it all down.  I didn't do any
of the quests, though, so I don't know what the stats of the armor
pieces are.  I found the quest givers for Erudite paladins and Erudite
good clerics but still haven't found who gives the quests for Erudite
casters (checked both Erudin and Erudin Palace where the casters
guilds are, and some other players were looking as well and couldn't
find the NPC).  Is there newbie armor available for Erudite casters or
did I maybe overlook an NPC?  (it seems that it's one NPC who gives
the quest to magicians, wizards and enchanters, at least that's how it
is for the other races).

By the way, I thought about posting the info about the quest NPCs and
items needed to the newsgroup but decided not to as I'm sure a number
of people who read the NG would rather figure it out for themselves
(and it is pretty easy to figure out), plus there's always
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/ for people who want spoilers (they
already have the Ogre warrior newbie armor quest info webbed, along
with the armor stats, and will probably have the rest of the quests
webbed soon).
