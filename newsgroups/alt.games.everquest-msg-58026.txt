Lol!  I was medding in SK, and was medding while AFK (read, putting kids to
bed) when I heard CRACK!  "Sorry kids!  Daddy'll be right back!"  I hear
another CRACK! running to my computer to find 3 GM ogres standing behind me.
One was kicking me occasionally until I got up.  Once I got up I ran and
they started attacking everyone else.
...Gating!
It's kind of funny how they picked on me, but at least didn't completely
wipe me out while I had "AFK" clearly next to my name.
I wonder if he would have kept kicking me until I died???
