    Smoothly, once I had the right spells memmed.  What I did is crawl
into the water and slap it to get its attention, then run into the hall
leading to the chamber so that I wouldn't get agro if any stupid rats
spawned in the room.  Mug is very slow (compared to a J-boots SoW) and I
was able to Wrath him a few times as he hopped up to me.  Once engaged I
just hit autoattack, and chained nuked.  Our hit points went down at
more or less the same rate, his just a bit faster than mine.  I ran out
of mana, got a few solid hits with my Staff of Living sand, and he ran. 
I followed, he got stuck in a door (that lead to the king's chamber, I
believe) and I beat him to death.
   I should point out that my defense and offense are close to being
maxed for level.  My 2hb is close to 100.  I hit for a max of 49 with my
staff, though I don't think I landed any full hits on Mug.  My wis is in
the 170's so my mana pool is fairly deep.  I had both my cleric buffs on
me, and I had also thrown a symbol on myself.  I was getting nervous
when I ran oom.  Just was lucking that he blinked before I did.
   I've certainly had more difficult encounters, though.
