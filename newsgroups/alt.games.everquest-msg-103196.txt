LOL! Ahh yes the classic attempt to FD train a class that can also FD, I was
witness (in the room with the players) to an upset monk that decided to FD
train (after threatening, in tells, that he was about to do this) an SK and
Necro friend (I now have that Necro) unfortunately the monk was successful
in his FD and just got up and walked away without another word, embarrassed
I guess he would have been if he could have heard us laughing. Would have
been much funnier to see the <Monk001> has fallen to the ground, message :ï¿½)

Careful with the Chief, when he dies he can spawn Ryg'orr avengers (around
the point he dies) and the make elites look like kittens, luckily (for you,
this time) he doesn't always spawn them and I'm not sure if there is a
controlling factor to this, just remember to have gate mem'd if you are
going to take him out.
