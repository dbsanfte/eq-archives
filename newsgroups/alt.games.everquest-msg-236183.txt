	Well, if I hadn't promised to turn over a new leaf I'd
suggest that as much as four hours of downtime every day for 
approximately a week some of which was completely unscheduled
in a paid for commercially provided ASP network product is prima
facie evidence of a flaw _somewhere_.  But since I have promised...

	YOUR ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!!!  There are NO FLAWS!  Sony managed
to release an upgrade to a 7 (?) year old product with only half a dozen
show stopping bugs that should have never made it out of QA, an uptime 
statistic approaching 85% (5 8's is almost nearly as good as 5 9's 
right???) , and just a couple of on the fly changes that were only 
a little unfair to just a few people.  My hat's off to SOE!  I sure
wish I could run a network half as well!!!!
