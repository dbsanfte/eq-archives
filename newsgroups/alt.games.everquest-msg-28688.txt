Puns are the most advanced form of humour.  All other forms (except,
curiously, some elephant and knock-knock jokes) depend on implied or
actual physical or psychological harm to someone or something.  Puns,
on the other hand, require a good command of language, and the better
your knowledge, the more intricate the puns that can be made.

(Some elephant jokes depend upon incongruity for their effect.  Most
knock-knock jokes, like puns, rely on language twisting.)
