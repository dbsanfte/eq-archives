I intended actually sacrifices. I suppose it works for an overwhelming
liklihood of death as well.

I agree with your comments about 'merely risks'... although i think
its a game of degree. e.g. If I get involved in a road rage incident
... am I risking my life... possibly... but its not likely.

I agree.

A calculated risk, maybe. After all, if they're life ends they derive
no pleasure from it. Giving pleasure *isn't* pleasure if I don't make
it.

That's getting pretty abstract for hedonism. I can't quite accept that
the "accepting death on the balance of the idea that someone else
might be very grateful is greatest amount of pleasure I can ever
derive for myself and thus this course of action is the course of
maximum pleasure". 

No. I think that's altruism, pure and simple. Cramming that into
hedonism requires an awful big prybar.
