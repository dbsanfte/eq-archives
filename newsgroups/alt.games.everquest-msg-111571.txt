He was grouped, not sure who with, he had to disband to get the Wolf form.
If I recall the only healer in the zone was a 13th level cleric being power
levelled by the other Druid, of course there were anons so he may have been
with a priest class of some sort.
Don't think I exactly power levelled him or corrupted him, I wasn't in the
zone long enough for him to pester me any more.
