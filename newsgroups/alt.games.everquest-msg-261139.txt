In a perfect stonemite free world about 32, but since Taelosia is not such a
place, closer to 20 mobs an hour.  My one task took about 1.5 hours, since
there were several other people in Chardok looking for skeletons too.
Probably could have been done in 30mins, if no one else were there.  If I am
in search of xp, then tasks are not the best use of my time.  I'm going to
try another one soonish so that I can see how much aa xp I would get.  It
was a pretty fun to run around Chardok again.
