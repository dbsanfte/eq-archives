That's a good point. Lance might actually make more money killing the
spiders, or at the very least should kill them too for the silks. I
know he probably dosen't want to leave this character logged in to
Bazaar with, seeing as he has a 65 Chanter on FV. However, the silks
go for what, 30pp+ on Luclin? A great deal more than they do on FV in
any case. Sell them for half or 3/4 market value, and I doubt you will
have to leave them on the character long in the Bazaar. Probably go in
a few minutes. It's one of the "comodities" people are always
speculating in.
