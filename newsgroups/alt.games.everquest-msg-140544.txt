So, switch to the windowed display (also known as the skanky old one), in
Display options, set it to not keep the same resolution, set it back to keep
the same resolution, switch back to the better full screen display.  If you
run at 640x480, then you may be SoL.  You could change the display
resolution to something else, then back to 640x480, that should do it also.

I was kind of annoyed that the cursor problem had never been an issue for me
until the new UI came out.
