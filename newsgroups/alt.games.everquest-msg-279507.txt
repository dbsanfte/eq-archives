Maybe, we seem to take opposite sides often enough ;)

Here though, not really. I don't particularly care to see all the 
chatter in /ooc either. I think its out of place in /ooc. But I don't 
think it should be moved to /shout either. (Which is why I've been 
flogging /auction for as much of it as possible...)

If I were in charge... I'd change /say to zonewide (and make it light 
grey or green). I'd leave shout as is. And I'd add /whisper or 
/sayquietly to do what /say does now.

So when you just want to talk to those within earshot its /whisper... 
(or maybe /sayquietly) and general chatter is in /say, and when you need 
to get in everyone's face /shout.
