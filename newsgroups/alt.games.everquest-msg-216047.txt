I've noticed something in LDoN that I'd forgotten I noticed a long time ago
(my ranger doesn't get much play, but LDoN is a great pickup group format so
getting a little more these days).  If I pull with snare, it's almost never
resisted, or if I hit it with snare while it's still walking into camp and
not actively being beat on.  But if I start trying to snare just mid-combat,
I'll get 2 or 3 resists *usually*.  And again, if the mob is just about to
turn and run, or is running, I almost never get resisted.

I'm not sure what that points to exactly, just my observations.
