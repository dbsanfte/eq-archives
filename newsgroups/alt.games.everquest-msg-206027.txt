Mage bracelets are NOT the same as ID1/ID2/ID3/ID4 items.

Please refrain from giving out incorrect information - no mage below
level 60 needs to ask a higher mage for foci.

The reason : 

At level 20 you get Jade Bracelet, which works on Nukes up to level
34, at 44 you get Opal Bracelet that works up to 52, at 54 you get
Ruby bracelet that works up to 60,and at 61 you get Sapphire that
works to 65.

You'll note the gaps (39spells and 53 spells)

However, this has no real effect as mages only get one focusable nuke
at 39 (Expell Summoned) which is useless anyway, the 39 rain is
not focusable (rains aren't as a rule) and there is no 53 nuke for
mages.
