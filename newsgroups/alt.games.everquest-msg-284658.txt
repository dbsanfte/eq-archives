Sounds like a corrupted file somewhere is making the patcher get
stuck.  Try finding and manually deleting main.png or whatever it was
and run patcher again.  If that doesn't work, you could go to
EQPlayers, look for EQ forum, and then head to technical support
section.  Check for any posts including stickies before making your
own help needed post.
