Are you getting some med time in while the creatures is feared? Personally
I'd use the snare-root-dot method instead of fearing. This usually allows
you to work in a smaller space and med while the creature is rooted. Also
cuts down on roamer problems. After rooting and DOTing you move off a
comfortable distance, face the mob, and sit. When the root breaks you stand
and reroot, back up a bit, and med some more. Reapply dots when they wear.
If you still consistently run out of mana it could be the mobs just have too
many hitpoints for your level and current dots.
