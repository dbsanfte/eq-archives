I had just the same trouble.
Then I direct ordered from Ubi Soft.
(Strangely they had stock to hand)
The order is actually handled by someone called "digital river"

They charge over the odds (�19.99) but you can get over night delivery.
This is where my problems started.
Securicor who handle the delivery lost the package, but I only managed 
to beat this out of them / digital river after 5 days.

The up side is that they are now sending me a copy free of charge.
So instead of paying �27.74 inc overnight delivery I'm paying nothing 
and getting 1 week delivery time.

A fair trade I think <G>

Try this horrible URL :
http://www.digitalriver.com/dr/v2/ec_MAIN.Entry?SP=10007&SID=42206&CID=0&CUR=826&DSP=0&PGRP=0&CACHE_ID=0
