It is your imagination.

DAOC was very popular during its first month.  I saw a fairly
substantial drop in the Everquest population on my server.

Unfortunately, I do not think that DAOC has much staying power.  The
game, while technically sharp, suffers from a poorly realized game
world (where are all the cool zones?  All I ever find in DAOC is
endless "Asherons Call" style rolling hills) and some serious play
balancing issues (without good content, the game relies heavily on
PvP.  I have never seen PvP work in a game where so much of a
character's ability is based on level; who wants to get slaughtered
over and over by the 3% of the server population who are "hooked up"
with the best guild and who have unlimited time to level-up?)
