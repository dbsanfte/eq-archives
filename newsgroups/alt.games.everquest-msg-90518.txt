nope... e.g CoF (back slot) will NOT stack with FBSS (waist) or Mith 2H
(weapon)

for haste stacking you only get the benefit from the BEST ONE of each of the
following...

Haste Item... eg, FBSS
Haste Spell... eg Alacrity
Haste Proc... eg Ex Axe

Innate Haste (high level Monk H2H... kinda misnamed because it's not really
haste... your fists somehow become better weapons as you level... higher Dam
and lower Delay)

Weight Reduc.Quivver... ranged weapons ammo coming ONLY from the quivver...
having 20 items in the ammo slot doesn't help... just keep 1 in the ammo
slot, the haste is from replacing that item when expended. This works for
Shiruken and other Thrown weapons small enough to fit inside quivver... tho
Monk throwing shiruken and doesn't stack with Monks' Innate Haste (which
ONLY affects H2H)


Even then... the total 'haste' a player can get is capped (dunno at what
level... but apparently, Quivver haste can take you over that cap)
