I think that, with regard to the xp deficit idea, either way is fine
with me. They both offer me incentive *not* to screw around and get
myself killed. One option just gives more incentive than the other.

Seriously, if they were going to fix everything that people don't like
about EQ1, then why go to the trouble of designing a new version? I'm
sure they are giving any significant changes to any aspect of EQ1 some
*serious* consideration before implementing them.  I can see quite
clearly why some of these "desirable" differences in EQ2 won't be
implemented in EQ1.
