That's what I saw when I tested it vs greens (hill giants, lions,
griffs) on Tuesday evening (GMT).  I tested again last night however on
light blues & blues in Howling Stones, and it was doing 15 points to
the mob every time it hit someone, making it a pretty good spell.
Stacks with druid/mage damage shields too.

So, either:

1) It doesn't work well on green mobs.
2) Verant changed since Tuesday night to work better.

Hope it's finally fixed now, I like the spell a lot in its current
form.
