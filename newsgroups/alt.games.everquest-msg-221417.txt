That was kinda my point.  I didn't mean precisely, exactly equal, where each
tank would have the exact same hp, ac, mitigation, and avoidance.  Just
close enough that a group would pick up whichever tank happened to be LFG at
the time, without waiting for a different class or feeling like they "must
have" a certain one.  You know how people in EQ are... the "ranger can't
tank in any situation", "must have KEI in every situation", and "only
clerics can be main healer" folks.  That kind of sentiment is what I'm
worried about developing with tanks again - "only warriors can tank."
