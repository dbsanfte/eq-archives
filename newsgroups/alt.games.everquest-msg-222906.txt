I can't get the target indicator on any of my chars, custom ui or not.  I
made sure that 3D ring is on, TargetIndicator files are in the regular and
custom ui directories, and camped and exited EQ a number of times without
success.  The name of the targeted NPC or PC does flash, but I don't get the
nifty ring or box I was looking forward to.
