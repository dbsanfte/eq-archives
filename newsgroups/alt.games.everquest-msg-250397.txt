Everquest 9.5?  95% of EQ play is grouped?

Maybe since the grouping exp distribution took place things have 
changed, but over the lifetime of the game?  People soloed -all- the 
time.  Heck, druids and necromancers and bards and wizards?  Hard to get 
them to -stop- soloing... and after trying them out a bit (except 
wizard) I could see why... join a group and get half the exp per hour, a 
sixth the loot per hour?

I've played every character I've had solo for a significant chunk of 
their lives, even my cleric did easily a third of his operating life 
solo, and that wasn't with particularly good soloing gear... and the 
reason he soloed as little as that was because there was always demand 
for a cleric, so getting a group wasn't that big a deal, if I was going 
to have the time free.

Is there a class that can't solo decently?  There are certainly classes 
that are better off soloing than grouping, at least much of the time.
