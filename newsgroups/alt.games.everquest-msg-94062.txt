For me, it depends.  A *courteous* tell will usually generate a
positive response....with or without mention of compensation.  But
"Can I get a rez?" or "Can I get a port?" is not a courteous tell in
my book.

What *really* irritates me is when my druid ports in somewhere and I
instantly get a tell of "Can I get a port?"  It's as though I've been
ambushed, and in a sense I have.  The person is staking out the druid
ring, stalking druids.  You'd think he might realize that if I've just
ported in here, the odds are very good I want to *do* something here,
rather than cater to him.
