It is?  Ok, can you tell me the change in the number of Druids logged on
to the average server during 4PM-9PM Pacific Time on each of the first
seven days of DAoC's release expressed as a percentage in relation to
the numbers from the first seven days of this month?  

Since you didn't provide a direct yes or no response to a direct yes or
no question I am left only to surmise, but it appears that your answer
was yes if I'm not mistaken, you do see them as the same, or more aptly
stated, you can't see the difference.  That means to me that you are
incapable of grasping the facts at hand and so further serious
discussion with you on the topic would be pointless.  Carry on.
