You are quite confused about where you should be getting xp then.  At 
level 65, I am getting AAs far far faster than I could at lower levels, 
whether soloing or grouped.  At lower levels, I soloed in PoN for about 
2% AAXP per kill.  At 65, I solo in BoT, PoV, HoH for 5-6% AA per kill.  
There is simply no comparison.  Grouped, I generally hit Earth, and one 
AA an hour is not hard with an average group.  Even prior to that, I was 
able to get one AA in 70 minutes grouped in BoT doing the courtyard.  
Sure, mobs I could hunt at level 60 for less xp are now green to me, but, 
I can now hunt mobs that give more xp.
