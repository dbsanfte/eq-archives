And it's the same in EQ. IF you choose to follow the crowd through the
easiest, most popular, most crowded zones, IF you race to 60 by whatever
means possible to get their fastest, IF you just play EQ like a glorified 3D
Gauntlet, then yup, it will suck. It will especially suck when you get to 60
and realise that, in essence, you are playing the same game you were 50
levels earlier. These are the people that complain loudest about the game
being boring and pointless.
Much better, in my opinion, to just play the game and let the levels take
care of themselves. Go out and see the world. Stray from the beaten path.
Test yourself and your groupmates against tough opponents and situations at
all levels. Even CRs can be fun :P But don't burn yourselves out on the
levelling treadmill then complain that the game sucks or a lot of people
will just be snickering at you.
