Best time I had with a KS-er was in EC at the orc camp.  I was farming the
one camp for faction and belts.  The other camp had a small group working
it.  At the time of day I was playing there were only a few people in the
zone, not more than 6 people of the appropriate level to get xp from the
camps so I figured it was a good time to do it without taking all the spawns
from xp groups.  I was just minding my own business medding up when this
little dwarf (think he was a warrior) comes running in and starts whacking
on the orcs.  I just let him have a spawn off every full pop and ignore him
mostly.  One time he got in a little trouble and had an add that I peeled
off him and saved his butt.  Everything is going ok until he decides to
start on the orcs I'm killing.  That makes me mad!  So I tell him I've been
camping here and as soon as I'm done he can have the camp. Even offered to
keep the camp broke so he wouldn't get ganked in the first five minutes
alone. He gets all mad saying we have to share the spawns, blah blah blah.
I point out that next time he gets an add all I have to do is sit back and
watch the fun.  He wanders around a minute or so more and decides to join
the group at the other camp.  Was kind of hoping he'd stick around so I
could stomp on his corpse a little.
