Agreed, on both counts, but part of what I've learned is that no matter
how many times they ask me to join I need to continue to turn down
offers from the/a uber guild on my server.  The pleasures of being uber
are not compatable with the things I enjoy in EQ.

Actually the sarcasm I was refering to was in Dev Null's post, unless
that is another handle of yours.  In your discussions with Sang I
actually see equals discussing things that matter to them, you have
plenty of knowledge of  your  own, though of course Sang would be
offended to being lumped together with you like that heh.  

There is little repect in my mind for ubers or their guilds though, no
matter how much they like to believe that they have earned it.  I was in
a unique position to watch exactly how a very famous uber guild became
uber and to this day when I see their guild name or the name of their
leader I remember how they got where they are.  No names here cause I'm
not really at liberty to go into details or provide evidence of what
I've seen, but respect is a little harder for any uber to earn with me
after those days.
