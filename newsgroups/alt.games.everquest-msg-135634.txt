I got a system announcement yesterday around 7-8pm PST or so.  They
announced that we were close to getting 100k people on at once playing at
the same time.  They want us to pass the word along and try to get more
people on at that time to see if we can get that 100k number.  I logged at
about 9:30pm PST and didn't hear whether we got close to this number or not.
Anyone know?

Rom

p.s.  Wouldn't have been surprised if 99k of those were in the bazaar, LOL.
