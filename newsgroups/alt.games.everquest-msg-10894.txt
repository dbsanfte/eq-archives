Nope, there are definitely two static halfling druids at the Misty
ring.

I'm pretty certain that the halflings in Misty are in the Stormreapers
(halfling druid guild) faction.  They con warmly to my halfling cleric, as
does the Rivervale druid guild.  They're also definitely not on the
same faction as the humans & half-elf NPC's at the NK druid ring as
someone suggested - those con apprehensive to my cleric.

Killing Runnyeye goblins (in Butcherblock, Misty & Runnyeye itself) is
a good way to raise Stormreaper faction.
