The problem isn't just a demand for instant gratification, though
I agree that's part of it.

I wasn't "back in the early days", but as I've heard it described,
yes, people would travel to out-of-the-way places and then stay
there for a couple weeks, either grouping with friends who'd also
made the trip, or just forming pickup groups with whoever was there.

But as the world got bigger, there were (a) more places for people
to be, and (b) more people with characters at or near the max level,
who weren't interested in hanging around anywhere except the latest
high-end phat-lewt camps.  So if you traveled to, say, Splitpaw
(before the recent revamp) you'd likely find it empty.  Hard to hang
out and form pickup groups that way.

Of course, part of the reason places are empty is precisely because
people can easily travel to other places, so they don't feel the need
for extended stays.  But I do think part of the natural evolution of
the game forced it to introduce more efficient travel.  Otherwise,
instead of having lots of content that people visit only occasionally,
there's be lots of content that doesn't get visited at all, because
it's too much trouble to reach and there's not enough people there to
make it worthwhile.
