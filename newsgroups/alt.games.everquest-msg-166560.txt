First off, excellent post.  If you're already thinking this way (in
character) at level 17, you'll do well I'm sure.  Now to the questions.

As far as I know the xp gain from light blues is minimal so you should be
fine doing this.

My theory on what is going on here is that you are casting the healing spell
after moving in some way.  When you cast it, do you see a message in the
chat box saying something about your spell is interupted or do you see
"Summerbreeze feels a little better."  or some such message?  If it's the
first, there is a slight delay between when you stand up, or stop walking
and when you can cast that will interupt your spell as if you are still
moving.  Just get used to standing up, waiting about 1 second and then
casting.  It's a rhythm that all of us healers get used to eventually.

Ages ago, yes, but not anymore.  There was a patch awhile back, more than a
year now I think, that removed the Look at Spellbook to meditate issue prior
to level 35.  Don't worry about all of that, sitting IS meditating, so don't
worry about looking at your spellbook.

You will be able to cast most of the spells early on in your career and only
later be able to make the potions.  The reason being that you must first
gain the inner ability to cast the spell and only later have the knowledge
to put that spell into a potion that someone else could use.  The key to all
of this is that "someone else can use" part.  Spirit of Wolf potions for
instance can be sold for 100pp for a 10 Click Potion.  As I understand it,
the cost of the reagents to make the 10 potions without failure is around
75-80pp so you're looking at a nice profit there.  There are other potions
that you can make money off of, but not familiar with the cost/price ratio
there so I'll leave those to you to figure out.  Haven't played a shaman
that high yet so I don't know a whole lot, but from what I have heard, a
Shaman can be one of the best money makers in the game.

Enjoy your duo, my girlfriend and I are doing the exact opposite, with me
playing the warrior and her playing the shaman.  VERY good duo so far.
