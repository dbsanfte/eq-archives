As the saying goes, if you sit on the tracks, a train's bound to run you
over. As long as you make an effort to avoid anyone along the way,
you've got nothing to worry about. I will usually try to offer a warning
of simply "Train to zone!", but that's about it. For all the dweebs that
complain, "Which zone?!", I say I'm not gonna create a custom hotkey
reflecting the zone I'm currently hunting in. If you hear me yell about
a train, keep an eye out. 

Anyway, it shouldn't be a problem for anyone except those who refuse to
leave the safety of the zoneline at their back. I normally have little
trouble avoiding the rest.
