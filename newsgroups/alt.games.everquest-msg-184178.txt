The game is as time-consuming as you choose to let it be. Currently
unemployed, I could if so inclined, be in my server's #1 guild (in
terms of content finished) and raid 10-12 hours a day with the kids
who are part of it. Or, I could be in a completely social guild, where
I only get gear upgrades if I buy them. Neither fit my play style, so
I don't play that way.

If you can't live with only rising to the level of the game you're
willing to put in the time for, EQ isn't the game for you. But, you're
also probably an enormous whiner crybaby who thinks the world owes
them a living, too. (Note that I am using the "royal you" here.)
