Well, i thought I'd check it out and it was interesting. I created a
halfling rogue and ran like mad for the book, made it, and got soulbound in
PoK. Then a had a ball, talking to assorted ogres, dark elves, and iksar,
some of whome were bookish, others vaguely threatening. They seemed to
recognised i was an agnostic, and some of them disapproved, telling me they
actually preferred their enemies, since they weren't such terrible fence
sitters.

I gave them a big hug (for a halfling) and a wave, and moved on. I
especially enjoyed the civilised iksar as I have long played mine as
rebelling against the central cabilis authority.

I checked out all the ports and was delighted that all the cities were
represented, and also realised, once and for all, that the days my druid
could make cash were over. What's left? Skyfire? Ej? Grim forest is a couple
of zones from shar vahl, so i suspect my luclin ports are now largely
outdated. Couldn't find who sold the spell there so cant compare the mana,
but it wasn't as laggy as grim forest, and banking as selling might be as
easy, and hopefully cheaper manawise; luclin ports should burn thru the
mana!

I was a little disappointed that the boats are still needed. I'd love to go
to ocean of tears or tim deep more often, but i loathe the boat system. I'd
rather swim, given the choice.

It was funny how easy it was getting to FV and overthere, and how dangerous
FV is. Strangely, an evil character has it much easier getting overthere. FV
has it's book buried in the maze below. Why? You have to run past those
drachnids, who love snaring, see through invis, and are ignored by the
guards. A troll on the other hand pops up out the outpost and wanders right
in, no drama.

A halfling also can wander in, but agnostic or no, you ain't welcome. I'm
glad i can't lose anything dying at level 2, certainly would have made a
corpse recovery impossible.  I was hoping to scout out the path an iksar
monk would have to take to do one of the shackle quests, but lord grimrot
and his men did a much better job than those golems at welcoming me into the
outpost.Sheesh, i was practically kissing one of the golems, waiting for it
to finish scowling and actually kill me.

I can't see a reasonable way for an iksar monk of less than 60+ getting this
shackle done. Sure, sneaking might work, but i expect the probable outcomes
is a lot of xp lost due to deaths incurred whilst being a third rate rogue.
It should have been a lot easier to increase venril sathar faction, or they
should have made the component dropable, but i guess they aren't going to
change it, and the shackle isn't that good anyway. It's just unfinished
business really.

I suspect I'll get my monk to a powerful enough point that he can walk into
the outpost, buy goods and leave, but i'll never understand why they made
the iksar bracer so much harder than the human sash quest, when in the end,
it's nowhere near as useful.
