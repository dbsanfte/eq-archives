Which is why Blood of Pain is a much shorter duration than Heat Blood.
I'll use it instead of HB, as opposed to as well as, though. And probably
only on Luclin mobs with their "Tons of hitpoint = Yay! What a good idea"
thing.


Oh, and in PvP as well, of course. =)

Agree on this.

Depends where you are and the respawn rate of the mobs. When I was
fearkiting koblolds down the ramp form SolA to the window room (surprisingly
effective), by the time I ran OOM, I had also run out of easily accessible
kobolds. And that was with using disease cloud, shadow vortex and the ATK
tap I can never remember the name of, as well as engulfing darkness, fear,
and keeping deadeye, grim aura and lifetap proc up at all times.
No KEI, no insanely high INT.

Really? I'm at 51, and the only spell lines I have to regularly swap out are
my self-buffs, and my pet/pet buff - if I'm in a place suitable to use it.
Otherwise I pick the spells according to where I'm soloing, and I'm done.
1) Lifetap
2) Darkness
3) Heat Blood/Disease Cloud (depending if I want more damage or a AC debuff)
4) Spear of Disease
5) Spear of Pain
6) Rotating buff/pet slot.
7) Invoke Fear/Fear (Again, depending on whether I need long or short fear)
8) Feign Death

I <3 my Weighty Polearm. 250 plat for such a decent weapon? Bargain.

I used heat blood when fear-kiting Luclin mobs, mobs with damage shields,
etc, etc. Situational use, I admit, but still used. Oh, and again I use it
in PvP - mainly to counter regen of one sort or another - it's funny how
many twinks in funigs panic when their regen goes bye-bye. And I use disease
cloud more often than that for the AC debuff. Plus - since the various aggro
changes Dots are frequently better aggro management tools than the (nerfed)
stat taps, and can be better than the Terror line as well.

Barring Level 30, which is the first 'OMG I can do what now?' level for SKs.
=)
I think that 52 is going to be another one of *those* levels now - a new,
actually semi-useful pet, the (fixed) Mental Corruption, and a faster-recast
Feign Death.
