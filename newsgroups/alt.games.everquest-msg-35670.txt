I wouldn't kill a treant just for the coolness factor of them.  The first
time I saw one was in WK.  I heard a swoosh swoosh and checked track (playng
my ranger).  Closest thing to me was something called a treant.  Turned
around and the huge sucker walked up to and thru me.  Awesome.  I conned
kindly to him.
