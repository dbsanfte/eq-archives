Read the rest of my statement. This comes not from the level you're
rading at, but from the quality of your gear is comparison to the rest
of your guild. If your guild is doing Vex Thal and you only want one
or two upgrades, you're probably ready for the elemental planes, but
your guild isn't yet, because other people's gear is lagging.

When I was running a guild that was doing Halls of Testing,
Vindi/Statue, Rhags, Rumblecrush, and similar MObs at that level,
there were at least a half-dozen players who, over the course of six
months, got a total of one or two drops because they were already in
full Kael/Skyshrine or better gear.

Had we moved up a level, they would have gotten more loot because more
of it would have been an upgrade. Similarly, if Monual decided to go
to a guild still doing NToV/Ssra, he would get less loot over time
because he doesn't need that stuff.
