Rural Life??? Head scratch.

On a farm, you work when the work is there. It was only in factories
with clocks that need to "shift" the time. But I don't know the origins.

In Oz, sold as being good for urban lifestyle - you can come home after
a days work and mow the lawn instead of on the weekend {:-(. 

Besides, it fades the curtains and the cows stop giving milk {:-)
