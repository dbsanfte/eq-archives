Heh - I'm with you here.  With any luck,
morons like UN won't be on the RP server.
I have no illusions that it will be all
sweetness and light there - but I'm hoping
the stricter naming rules and chat rules
will help out. 

Interestingly, I didn't think the article
justified the rating - from her description
in the text I would have thought she'd go
for 3 and 3.5 (WoW has to lose something for
the worry that the quick leveling pace will
allow people to get to the endgame content
(and through it) before there is more.  Also,
the designers are trying to make grouping the
more effective leveling method after 30 by 
increasing the XP award from instance mobs.)
