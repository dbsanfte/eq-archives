One thing to watch out for that seems to be a recent problem: if the
General aggros on somebody and you have to blur him, he might warp all
the way back to the start point.  I had it happen once during my shawl
run and have heard of it happening to others since, and nothing induces
that sinking-stomach feeling quite like hearing people say "uh, where'd
the general go?" :-)

Fortunately if that happens he'll still resume where he left off, he'll
just take a while getting back to that point...  If you're impatient,
you could aggro him and pull him back to everyone else and risk
blurring again.  You won't have to refight any waves you've already
completed.

The wolves are mezzable, though in the runs I've done we usually just
fight them all at once anyway as practice for the giant waves.

The Iceclad map from maps.eq-toolbox.com shows the spawn points for
each wave in the map window, if you don't like surprises.
