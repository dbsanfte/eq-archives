Please Sir ! Sell this fellow UK and Zeb player a 14/24 for 1k !! 
</sarcasm>
Sorry :) Serious head on now. On zeb, current standard prices are:
Lammy 3.5k
Centi LS 1.7k

Of course I'm the Ranger that traded a Locustlure for a CSS (14/28)
the day before Luclin came out. Imagine my happiness in seeing
1,000,001 Centi Longswords appearing :) and I appreciate that these
items are nothing more than crap/vendor loot for DH.

Gratz on the Sleeper BTW. Didn't want to say anything before, seeing
as most of the happy guilds decided to use it to flame DH again, which
to me was terrible. Maybe if I keep playing for the next 8 years I'll
be able to meet your entry requirements :)

About the only thing that p's's me off about Zeb is that I'm usually
about to log just as all the good raids are starting. Do you raid late
into the night with DH?
