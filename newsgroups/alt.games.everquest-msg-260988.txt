Actually, he said that 66+ they are easy, and I was just mentioning that 
SoE specifically said that they are not intended for 66+.  Given the 
testimonial of the one 66 person who did one, sounds very much not worth 
the effort for any decent soloer anyway.

I do understand that he was saying that at his level, the tasks suck bad, 
and it does sound like it, at least for some of the tasks asigned.
