We don't know then, since its a FV thing.

Best way to do a price check. Get luclin if you don't have it. Enable
the  new UI. Go the the bazaar.

/bazaar

itemimlookingfor (at top left)

hit enter

see what the prices are.

Hmm... now you've made me curious. I'm busting out the level 14 shaman
I abandoned long ago on FV and going to check out bazaar no drop stuff
there, HAR HAR!.
