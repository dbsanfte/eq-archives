Ah right I see, yes melee damage only.  Seems the mob AI has no way of
telling whether HP loss is via magic or melee on the /shielded 'friend'.

NEW PATCH

A new patch message was released today including a few tweaks. The biggest
change included a new warrior ability, /shield. This ability will allow the
warrior to absorb some of the damage from a specific person. 

- In the original patch yesterday morning, /SHIELD was added as an innate
ability that all Warriors now gain at level 35. Warriors may now choose to
take a portion of melee damage that is intended for another. Warriors,
please type /SHIELD for a full description of this ability. You may find
that it assists you greatly in your groups. 

Correspondingly, NPCs and Pets over level 30 who are Warriors were granted
this ability as well. Certain NPCs and Pets may choose to protect beings
that they have an affinity for, if they believe that it will benefit the
shielded being. For now, however, there is not yet a way to manually cause
or prevent this behavior in pets.
