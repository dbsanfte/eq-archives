wow that sounds like a bad roll back.  might be the same one my hubby 
almost lost all his stuff in.  he had a corpse that he had looted just 
before the server outage, when he finally was able to log back in, the 
corpse was gone, he had nothing on, and for some stupid reason, the 
buffs he had on before he died were still up.  For the life of me, I 
can't figure out how the server can remember the buffs but nothing else. 
  Luckily, the GMs were in a 'just make the rube happy' mood. 
Petitioned right away, and waited, not like he could do anything, 51 
ranger with nothing not even a sword.  Within 20 mins, he had a response 
from a GM who said he could be reset to the day before, all of his stuff 
and only a loss of about 60pp and a little xp.  We got lucky in that I 
guess.  Glad he didn't get any good drops or a ton of xp in that 24 hours.
