Give Fifi a pair of rusty weapons for dual wielding.

Play around some with using Mal-x to pull if you haven't already. If
you average more than one resist overall during a fight, mal-x is
probably a good investment. Since it has minimal agro, it's also handy
because you know your pet can get agro as soon as he engages if you
need it. Or, if you get adds on the way back to camp, having pulled
one with Mal- means you can drop a root on one on the way back to camp
and be pretty much guaranteed that root will stick for the full
duration while you get the add slowed. 

Not all shaman I know generally use mal-x to pull but a lot of them,
myself included, think it's worthwhile.

... click JBB if you've got it.

Worked pretty well even before Stoicism, JBB and Horse.  A lot more
fun in some ways because you actually got to swing a weapon while
doing it.

If you have a spare spell slot, pull out disempower. It's cheap to
cast and will guarantee you agro unless the other people are seriously
trying to steal agro from you.
