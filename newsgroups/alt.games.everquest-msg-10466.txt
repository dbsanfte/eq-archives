I had this incident today, and I'd like to hear what others think about it.
I'm playing a 14lvl Rogue on the Torvonnilous server, hunting willowisps and
young kodiacs in East Commons. I've just killed a young kodiac and a green
conned plains cat that joined the fight if I remember correctly. So I'm
sitting and healing with hide turned on by the path near the inn where
Kizdean Gix spawns. I'm at about 4 bubbles of health when a wisp flys by
about 10 meters away, and I decide to go for it. So I get up and run towards
it, but when I'm about 2 to 3 meters away, someone else pulls it with a
spell. A bit annoying, but not worth arguing about. A little bit later, as
the party of two that pulled the wisp is in the middle of the fight with it
about 30 or 40 meters away from me, another wisp comes by. Passing in front
of me by a couple of meters, seemingly on it's way to join the fight of the
first wisp. I attack it, but it doesn't aggro on me, instead it continues
towards the first wisp. I follow it over there, and have it down to about
70% health when the party has killed the first one. They then join in and
attack the one I'm fighting. I consider telling them to back off, but don't.
It ends with me getting the XP for the kill, so I loot it and move back to
heal. The two then comes running over looking for me, but can't see me
because I've turned hide back on as I usually do when sitting and healing.
One of them then tells me to stop killstealing. I explained what happened,
and he basically calls me a liar. This really pissed me off, as I felt I had
done nothing wrong, and I don't appreciate being called a liar.
Would you consider this a killsteal or not ?
