More from the Test Server!

Perhaps one of the more exciting changes made to the game in the last
48 hours on Test is for players Level 10 or below.

According to players who have been enjoying life as a Gnome Paladin or
Halfling Ranger, if you die while level 10 or below you now respawn at
your bind point with all your gear.

That's right, no more corpses for players under Level 10! This should
significantly help in reducing downtime or lost items due to corpse
decay. Note: This is only on the Test Server currently.
