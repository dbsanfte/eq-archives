As an American, I'd sure prefer if Britain did move away from continental
Europe and strengthened its already healthy relationship with us.  Hard to
say, though, which organization would be better for Britain in the long run.
Sadly for them, I am aware that America doesn't like sharing power much, and
it's my understanding that France and Germany have been getting more and
more cosy in an effort to better influence the course of the EU even against
the interests of fellow member nations.  In some ways, it's a lose-lose
proposition for the U.K.  Well, for my part, they are welcome to join us if
at any time they do decide their interests are better served outside the
Franco-German superstate.
