Of course this involves time and therefore money but when I started I
was told that one really needs to play a character into the low 20's
to see if you like that class/race.  I've since played a barbarian
shaman, a human magician, a dark elf necro, a wood elf ranger, a gnome
shadow knight, and an iksar monk.  aside from the ranger, they all
seemed a lot alike till low teens.  The ranger had his defining skill
from the start although it wasn't much needed.  I've taken each till
at least level 30 and in that time between 20 and thirty, I came to
love playing my monk the most.  He's now level 58 and still a blast to
play.   While he wasn't the easiest, he's my choice because of
enjoyment.  I actually think the barbarian shaman was the easiest to
get to 30.  That may have been some luck.

Qiset.
