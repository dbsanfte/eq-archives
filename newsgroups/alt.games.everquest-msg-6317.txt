You have to remember most of the people were JUST like you when they started
their first character and got him high enough to be able to get twink items.
They went through it just like you are going through it.  Its their reward
for spending so much time.

I don't twink however, because I enjoy my high level, and I'm not going to
play another character until I get to 60.   (i don't think i could ever
stand to look at that damn spellbook again while meditating)
