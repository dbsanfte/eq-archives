Most single-player RPGs give you options of what to say in a converation,
now allow you to create the conversation. I find it's just weird that people
would waste the effort of roleplaying on NPCs rather than use it in their
group. In my mind, it goes along the same lines of talking to your cat like
it's a human being, but being completely mute around real people.
