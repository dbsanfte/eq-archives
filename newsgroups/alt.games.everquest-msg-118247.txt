The cleric's Symbol line of spells (*very* nice buff for the melee)
require a peridot as a reagent for each cast when you get up to the
level ... (49?) symbol and above. Some groups will just make sure that
the melee's donate a stack of dots to the cleric so they don't have to
foot the bill. (Fair, in my opinion) and then just split all loot
evenly. Others, particularly the groups we run in Seb, dont' bother, let
the cleric bring their own dots, and we just give them all the "junk
gems" (rubies, sapphires, and below) as compensation for their costs.
Higher end gems, (diamonds, blue diamonds, blackened sapphires, et. al.)
get rolled on with the general loot. (Also very fair in my opinion.
Clerics get shafted on loot in many places, and I don't mind if they
walk off with even a couple KPP worth of gems so long as I get a roll on
the weapons and armor.)
