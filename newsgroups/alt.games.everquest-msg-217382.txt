I'm a relative newbie to the game. (I have but one character that I just got
to 32, but I've been slow about it and not explored much.) I really wanted
some cheese so I got a bit adventurous and tried to travel to Jaggedpine.
In SFG I fell into an underground river, swam around for a really long time,
and eventually died trying to find a way out.  (I did manage to get a loc
just before I died.)  What's the best way to get my corpse?

I was thinking I could go back, cast enduring breath on myself, and jump
back in...., but the whole problem is I don't know how to get out!  :)  In
fact, I'm not sure if I could find where I fell.

Any advice would be appreciated.  I've never even gotten a rez before, so
don't know if that will help, or if there is other magic that can help.

Thank you
Frinka
