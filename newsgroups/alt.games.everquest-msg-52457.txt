Well, when you don't happen to have a cleric handy, you make do with what
you have.  When I am acting as primary healer, I also slow the mobs.  I will
buff as well, so long as the group understands that this will mean downtime
for me to med back up.  It's much easier of course, if we have a bard or
enchanter or necro in the group.  From personal experience, with a good
group, including an enchanter, or a bard, or a necro for mana regen I can
keep up being main healer with single pulls.  I've done it in OT and in DL.
If there is an overpull, it means some downtime afterwards, but very rarely
has it meant anyone dies.  I absolutely agree that with a cleric, it is much
easier, but I won't agree, that at my level, it is not possible to be main
healer.  I do see the time rapidly approaching when it will be much more
difficult, as Greater Heal just won't cut it anymore.  As for dealing with
the aggro, that's what a tank's taunt is for.  Yes, when I slow a mob,
sometimes it aggros on me, the tank pulls it right back off.  I usually
group with a druid, so regen is generally going all the time, and I almost
never have to deal with healing myself, or having the druid heal me.  With a
good group, we can go nonstop single pulls with me as primary healer, with a
bad group, it bogs down very fast.
