If movies were of an interactive nature at all, your analogy might be at 
least somewhat valid. As it stands, it's apples to oranges. However, if it 
*were* an interactive experience it is a pretty safe bet that the 
challenging ones would be the more popular.

I don't go to movies to entertain myself. I go to be entertained with no 
effort on my part. If I wanted that from a video game, I could just watch 
all the cut scenes...wait...that would basically be a movie then...

I kind of look at my EQ characters as something akin to bonzai trees. I 
will wind up with an end product proportionate to my time investment. 
Sometimes a spend a good bit of time snipping and training, sometimes I 
just leave it alone and let it grow. What you are suggesting is for 
everyone to go with Chia Pets.
