Eh, dinging on important levels by strangers don't bother me in the
slightest.

But don't tell me you just dinged 3.  I really don't care.  Or level 6, 7,
10, 11, 13, 15...who cares?  They aren't important levels.

Class-specific important levels, cool.  Level 14 for druid...level 16 for
enchanter...cool, fine.  Level 17 for monks (FD then, right?  I forget if
it's then or 18).  Level 19 for shaman (shrink is fun :) ).  Spell levels at
44 & 49, ok, fine, though they get old.  Fifty One, 55 or 60 for
anyone...new titles.  Sixteen, 29 & 54 for enchanters (Breeze, Clarity,
Clarity II respectively); 39, 49, 56 for clerics...cool.  Level 30 for
rangers (SoW).  Cool.  Twenty-nine for druids (FIRST group port spell).
Whatever levels melee get new GOOD special attacks (which knocks quite a few
monk attacks into the category "I don't give a crap").  Cool.  I won't care
but it won't bother me, either.
