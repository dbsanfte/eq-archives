Of course I only used Dell as an example. Naturally a smaller, local 
system builder may often provide an even better deal.

That being said, Dell is near the top of the list of major PC 
manufacturers in terms of quality and support. To say their product is 
inferior is to say that most major manufactures' products are inferior, 
with which I would disagree. Just because it isn't the latest reference 
board from Abit, doesn't mean it is not comparable in performance and 
reliability. Video cards, hard drives, sound cards, RAM can almost 
certainly be upgraded and the processor is a likely candidate.

I always build my own, because I normally utilize some components from my 
old system. That is the only way it ends up being less costly for me.
