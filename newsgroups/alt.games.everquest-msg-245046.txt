Hehe, well, you caught me there.  Left unsaid in my original post is that,
because of my general boredom, I was motivated to try out a new toon with
new spells.  It was fun power-leveling and fun learning how to gate and buff
and stuff as a druid.  I now have a toon with tracking, the ability to port
me anywhere I want, can SoW me anytime I want, and is a good foragebot.
I've found that, during a typical gaming session, I can forage 2-3 stacks of
vegetables.

Yes, I could have bought lots of vegetables - in fact, I saw someone last
night selling 360 vegetables at 18pp each.  Still, as much as I support the
free market, something inside of me balks at paying someone 6500pp for
vegetables.  I'd rather spend five times as much twinking out a bot to do it
myself.  =)  A fine distinction, I know, and likely an illogical one.  But I
truly did have fun raising him up to 39.

As far as I know it's always been like that.  I started a beastlord when
Luclin came out and a cleric friend of mine came to help power-level me.  He
cast MoR on the baby mobs attacking me, and as long as I managed to get one
hit in I got the XP.  That's the earliest I've seen MoR used as a
power-leveling tool.
