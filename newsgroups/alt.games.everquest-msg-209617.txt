I would never do this of course, siunce its a clear violation of the
EULA, however my dog has a seperate account that he shares with his
pups, each getting two character slots on his main server while he has
three and a bazaar mule.  He will use the shared plat slot for cash
transfers but not as a family vault, same as he does the shared
equipment slots; nothing gets left in there that a six year old might
think of as handy and then leave rot on a 11th level character dead in
some zone he's forgotten the name of.

Other than shared accounts like this, (which again are violations
anyway) I suppose the only other people who will keep their cash
seperate are the few who like to view each character as seperate from
the others, either as a "RP" thing or as someone was pointing out in a
different thread, for the "this is what this character has earned" sort
of thing, the deliberately untwinked or limited twinked alt players.

Thinking about this further, I can see where this is a slippery slope,
that shared PP slot makes it even easier to casually spend more and more
on your alts.  Since high level characters end up at a level where they
really aren't blowing much cash, encouraging alts to blow thousands here
and there is a good way to keep the players hungry; the easier it is to
get the cash the easier it is to spend it without paying attention,
thats why you'll see ATMs in casinos and strip clubs these days.

Splendid, 10 mage, Firiona Vie (no shared account here!)
