I wish I had seen the event.(*sigh*)Anyways if i were verant trying to keep
FV alive have a god only for events spell on her of drain level (if you are
good ) If you hit her you loose a level. As for the people who like to make
fun of the event Have FV disintigrate all his belongings. I think that would
shut him up and if it doesnt then have him TP to a viod. But then I like the
role playing aspect and would like to actually SEE the world evolve. Its
only MY opinion though.
