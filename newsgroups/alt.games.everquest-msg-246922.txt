That's not even "playing" the game. :)

ROFLMAO... you know, I *totally* agree. But this is EQ...

I handed in 20 stacks of bandages to some halfling yesterday because he 
cut his hand, (well actually so that he and other halflings would like 
my SK and make his trips to highpass and the karanas a little speedier.

Given the state of the quests in EQ my solution is an order of magnitude 
better than the current state of the quest solution.

Besides it would be trivial to work in a plot that exceeds whats doled 
out by the wayfarers over time... and that's a good quest as far EQ is 
concerned :)

AC1 destroyed most of the old cities over time, according to some 
friends who still play... i loved AC1s monthly updates when i 
played...but the character system was even more flawed than EQs... at 
least on one of EQs good days.

EQ isn't a bad game...and it does have its stregnths... but there's so 
much room for improvement... and so little hope of it ever happening.
