You're going to have to revamp your ideas of what conclusions "the slowest
player" will draw. :/

I've been playing the game less than a year, and I'm very bad at mind
reading in general. What's clear to *me* is that there is an obvious, but
very difficult way of getting to the boss, not that that must be the only
way of doing it. There are lots of wierd things in the game that are
possible, but inobvious, that everyone seems to do, that make some tasks
much easier: turning in quest items while invis or hiding or sneaking,
turning in quest items to charmed mobs, sneak pulling, splitting pulls
using feign death, kiting, level 1 rogues doing corpse recoveries in The
Hole, duelling someone's pet for skill ups, etc.  Without reading Verant's
mind it's hard to know what's an exploit and what's a clever tactic.


Here's your guess on what happened...

Could you be a bit more specific on where the "exploitness" comes from?
From just the vague outline you sketch here, I don't see any single step
that isn't working as intended. 

Or put it another way. Most exploits involve taking advantage of weaknesses
in the game engine, the geometry, pathing, or something similar; if Verant
had the time and money to fix the problems as desired, the exploits would
simply not be possible. If Verant were to fix the game, zone, whatever,
so that the above-theorized exploit were no longer possible, which of the
events in the chain would no longer be possible?

Sorry to belabor the issue, but I'd like to play within the intended limits
of the game...
