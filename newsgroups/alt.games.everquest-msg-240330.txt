i'm a newbie (level 4 warriar, then level 6 wizard in). perhaps you 
should wait unless you have some friends who are willing to help you out 
a *lot* (and then do this with a group). the place i ended up in (west 
freeport) seems mostly deserted. naict, good doc is hard to find (i just 
found out i am on a server that allows people to kill you and i hear that 
if you transfer your character, you lose all of his stuff :( i have been 
killed 5 or 6 times by *%&^# players in last few days.
