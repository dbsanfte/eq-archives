What a lot of people fail to realise is that you never get an accurate
picture of a culture when veiwing it from the outside. You carry with you
your own cultural standards and expectations and people all over the world
tend to carry the inbuilt ignorance of attempting to apply these standards
when veiwing actions of others from different cultures.

I used to think Yanks in general were fat assed, over opinionated, loud
obnoxious assholes. Then slowly it dawned on me they were just different to
me and it was me who was the over opinionated asshole.

Remember the hand principal - when you point a finger at someone else, 3
other fingers are pointing back at you...
