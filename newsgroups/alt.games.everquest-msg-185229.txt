The gnoll and orc scalps would take you months.  One of my characters
was KOS to the Freeport militia and I decided to go this route (with
some goblin ears here and there) to get myself out of KOS.  It took me
over 500 scalps to get up to dubious.  Considering that scalps are a
pretty rare drop, it could take ridiculous amounts of killing just to
get the appropriate faction.

However, there is a different way.

Crushbone orcs, the centurions, pawns and slavers, drop orc scalps
that work for this quest, and getting 100 of them in a night isn't
that difficult at all.  Since they don't sell to merchants, most
people hunting in GFay and CB just let them rot on corpses.
