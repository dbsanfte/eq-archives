I'm sure I'm holding the flute, and  I got zillions of "tiny bubbles" messages.
And I sang it for 5+ hours straight.   Hmm.

I haven't played the bard since, but she's in a place where there are no bard guilds
(FV).  Perhaps the "raw bamboo" is not really a wind instrument, though it does
say that in the right-click description, and it does allow me to equip it in my
Secondary slot.

Thanks for your comments.  Maybe I'll eventually find the secret to success at this.
