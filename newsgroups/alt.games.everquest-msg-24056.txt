Nope, Class dependant.  Gorge hounds and Dark Stalkers con KoS to all,
but will NOT attack a Ranger or a Druid.  I've Medded in front of the
stupid Dogs, I took my druid(13 1/2) over there last night, walking over
and under a yellow gorge hound, He sniffed and stood there, and yes he
did con ready to attack.  Directly before Fear kiting them.  Now, once
you agro one all the nearby ones will jump you.  

Stupid Lion Patriarchs OTOH are still agroing 2 levels into green.
