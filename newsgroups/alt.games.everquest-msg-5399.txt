No, someone comes to this newsgroup, starts spamming and effectively
stalking a regular poster (me) by replying to his every post with a
carbon-copied insult, disrupting the newsgroup, and making ZERO
contribution and I go to his ISP and have his services revoked for
violating that ISP's TOS.

You may be joking around in this newsgroup playing troll. We're not
laughing.
