Well, hope you weren't too attached to your Geocities account. I'm
sure they don't like their web space being used to distribute trojans.
McAfee picked up BackDoor-Sub7.svr in the little zip file linked to on
your site.

Instructions for use from his web site:

Moron doesn't even know anything about the game... Can't "double click
on icon" while running EQ...unless, of course, you're running another
hack that'll let you alt-tab out.

Knew it'd contain a virus. Just had to check it out so I could blow
the whistle on his happy ass. What an idiot...
