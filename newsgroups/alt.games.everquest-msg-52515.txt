If you are in a group, is someone ask you heal/buff/rez :

1. You have mana : "answer "yes for donnation." else he ll be back 20 mins
later for refueling.
2. No mana : "I use mana for my group, you solo so nothing for you. Did u
shared xp u did ?"


I love duel in hostile area. A warrior dueled me in Skyfire lol, poor bag of
flesh.
Blind ... fear ... enjoy ! (if you can, fear and then blind ... now he is
blind and he KNOWS he is feared lol)
He gonna aggro few mobs, or have a lava bath. If he is under water ... ROOT
! i did that once, really the best.

Lot of people in duel dont look at environment. Move to be on the pathing of
a scowling mob, then root the guy hehe.
Finish the job, dont let monster kill him or he gonna loose xp ! The hardest
part.

Only few ppl dueled me, they never did it again, they says, "no you are a
sadic".
Once you dueller is dead, he gonna need a rez ... who will he call ?
Muhahaha !
