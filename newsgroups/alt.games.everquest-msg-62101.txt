So are you saying that there will no longer be the "half screen" option?
(The default one with the smaller window.) And that the only way to play
will be in full screen mode? Or am I completely missing what you're
saying? Because if that's the case, I'm fucked. All this upgrade
bullshit for nothing. I've tried numerous times to find a way that I can
play in full screen mode, but failed so I have to play in the default
mode. (I'm blue/green colorblind and I can't get a combination of
settings where I can read all the scrolling text on varying color/light
backgrounds.) I've heard that there's a way to make the backgroud of the
text window opaque, but first of all, I never found it, and second, if I
did, it would then block out my view of a big chunk of the screen.
Probably the part exactly where the nasty Troll-Eating-Monster is
standing.
