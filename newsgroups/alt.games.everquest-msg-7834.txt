Short and sweet:

Just got and wandered into Velious.  Troll Shadowknight.

Giants?  Dwarves?  or Dragons?  oh my!
I suspect I'll try to befriend the dwarves for the city, but any preference
on what you like to hunt here?
I was advised to try to befriend giants for the quests they give, but...
hard to decide :)
