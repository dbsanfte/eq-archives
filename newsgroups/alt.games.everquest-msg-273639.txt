Dont take me wrong,I am still playing EQ every day,and dont like to
bash it,but I cant keep my closed to the facts like low trader numbers
and seriously longer times being lfg.
The main complaint I have is,that there is not much to do while lfg.
Reading about WoW I have the impression,that I can progress my
characters there solo much better than in EQ.
Not sure how this effects the grouping situation in WoW and if its
hard to find groups,I have my doubts if I like a single player game
disguised as a MMORPG.
