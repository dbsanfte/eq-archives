If we've learned anything about VI's "Vision"(tm) it's they they are in
absolute love with their faction system, and they want it built into
every aspect of the game. With each expansion, it's become more and more
of a dominating factor in the lives of the citizens of Norrath. Old
world faction wasn't *that* big of a deal, because there realy wasn't
anyplace you absolutely had to go, and the areas you fought in were
places where things hated you anyway. In Kunark, the difference between
the FV and VS factions were much more important to good and evil
characters respectively if you wanted to be able to bank and shop, etc.
In Vellious, bad faction is the kiss of death and you have to deal with
the dragons eventually, and decide if you will side with the dorfs or
the giants.

I'm reading the history of Luclin in the book that came with the set,
and I think we will again see three primary factions. One, of course, is
the Vah Shir, but I don't think they are the major players. I think one
of the factions will be that of the settlers who were loyalists to the
combine empire, and one will be that of the descendents of the army that
came after them to hunt them down. The story says they left the Nexus
from the only two viable exits in different directions and set up cities
or fortresses someplace. I'm guessing that Sanctus Seru and Katta
Castellum are the two home cities for those factions. (Both bindable).
The kitty faction home city must be Shar Vahl. We'll have to move
carefully when initialy hunting and watch what factions we trash where,
what we build, where we can home locate ourselves, etc. 

The city of Shadow Haven next to the nexus is the descendents of the
people who abandoned the Combine loyalists, combined with remnants of
the army hunting them, so I'm thinking they are probably on the same
faction with whichever city the Army folks set up.

Your thoughts?
