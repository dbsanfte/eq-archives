Ok, I'm a lvl 22 beastlord and I rarely hit more than 15-16 damage in melee
combat, b/c my weapons suck.  I would buy weaps at the bazaar but I'm poor
(about 25 pp in bank) and I can't afford most of the stuff that's sold
there...

Also, I'm limited because the only combat skill I have that's really good is
Hand-to-Hand (this skill is *very* good but I haven't practiced the others
much so it's good at the cost of other skills).

So my question is:  where can I (1) find a place to get a lot of money fast,
or (2) find a weapon, preferably Hand-to-Hand, that has good damage but
won't cost me more than 25 plat?
