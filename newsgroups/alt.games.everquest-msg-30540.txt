Don't waste cash on Fine Steel Except for a few key pieces. As a 57
Warrior I have been there done that. My suggestion to you is to Aim
for full crafted. With a few exceptions.These are low end Items that
cost relatively little and should do you for a while.

Ears: Gold jasper (cheap) (Cougar Claw Earrings are good too but cost
more)
Head: Skull Shaped Barbute
Face: Iksar Pariah Mask (Lake od Ill Omen and very Common)
Neck: Collar of Undead Protection
Shoulders: Crested Spaulders
Arms: Crafted
Wrists Crafted Bracers x 2
Hands: Crafted Gauntlets
Chest: Enamelled Black Chestplate (the most expensive item and IMHO
the first you should buy AC25)
Legs: Crafted Greaves
Feet: Crafted Boots
Rings: Jagged Bands

All the Crafted is expensive. Take your time and work towards it. Plan
to have this list filled by level 35 and you are GTG for a while.

Ged rid of the wieghted axe and find yourself an Axe of the Iron Back,
common and cheap, its 2HS. Dont be impressed by the dam on the WA..
Its far too slow. 1HS, try to find some Velium 1HS stuff, its ok but
not great and often it will be free. Alternatively, if you can find
them anymore, buy 2 x Langseax's. They should run in at about 10pp
each. They are tricky to find these days though.

Remember, for a warrior, speed vs delay is the only thing you REALLY
look at. You do more damage that way.

I should know prices better for low end war weapons but its late and I
am tired :)
