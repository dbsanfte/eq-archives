You're a fucking moron.

Also, Using the FUCKING EASY TO FIND information contained in the header of
your post.

Your e-mail address is: cprince@woh.rr.com
People who agree that you're a fucking moron can complain to your ISP at:
abuse@rr.com
Your ISP is: Road Runner High Speed Online -- Northeast Ohio
You use this newsreader: Microsoft Outlook Express 5.50.4522.1200

AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!!!

FUCK OFF YOU LAME ASS MORON.  You have nothing to defend yourself with
besides false logic and arguing semantics, this kind of thing happens on my
server boards all the time, someone posts something that's the obvious
truth, and someone else thinks "shit, they caught me" and fills up 2 pages
of the thread pointing out the 1 mispelling in the persons post.

As for you, don't bother replying, I've decided you get the honor of being
fucking annoying enough that I'm going to figure out my killfile *just for
you*

In other words.  *plonk*
