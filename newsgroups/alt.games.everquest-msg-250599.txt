Alas no, it came up in the summit, so I wouldn't hold your breath for it.
Still, my last LDON basically was my mid level druid and a monk (nice
person) and a bunch of other people who had nooo idea. Especially this mage
who never said anything and just ... stood. Maybe he didn't know that
meditating works better if you sit.

I was trying to explain that when I was OOM (primary healer, can't get kei
at that level) then you shouldn't pull, and it's a good idea to have bind
wound parties to quickly get ppl to 70 %, then heal. Instead, this ranger
would helpfully heal until 70 % whereupon his mana would wear out... that's
when snare wasn't fizzling. I guess it's pretty easy to get into your mid
30's without casting snare as a ranger. I have a low level ranger who snares
constantly but I guess that's unusual behaviour for a ranger.

I always thought paladins used stuns and bashes against casters too. Oh
well. At least the monk knew what she was doing. I still can't get over the
monk saying "out of bandages" and the mage... standing there silently....
maybe he didn't know he could summon things?

p.s. does no-one know about the LFP tool? I see party members shouting "want
more for a GE group" but nothing in LFP every day in DSP.

p.p.s. Rockhoppers. Argh. Tailoring is driving me crazy.
