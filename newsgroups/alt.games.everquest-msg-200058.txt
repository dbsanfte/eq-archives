The possible definition(s) for the word "agnostic" have changed over
the years.  The originator of the word intended it to be something
along these lines: someone who believes the existance of god or god(s)
can't be proven or disproven.

Using that definition you can have "agnostic atheists" and "agnostic
theists" without any contradictions.

These days people generally define agnostic as "I don't know if
there is a god or not" and/or "I don't believe in god nor do I
disbelieve in god".

I can't think of any definition of agnostic that defines it as
"don't believe in god without proof".
