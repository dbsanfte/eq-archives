Level 52, not 57

Canni II is quest only, and a pretty irritating quest at that, as you must
get a no drop item off a rare pop mob in KC jail camp.  Not unreasonable,
except that the spell is level 39 but the camp is generally done by low to
mid 50s people!

I've seen a lot of shaman say they skipped Canni II and lived on I all the
way to III; III isn't "no drop" so you can pick it up in the bazaar.
