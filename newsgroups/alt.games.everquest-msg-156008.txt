Me too, really, I just think that there should stil be some soft of level
cap.  The way I see it, if I make an alt, I most likely am at the point
where I know either a Druid or Wizard if I need a teleport, or have the
plat I can transer to buy one.  The people I see a level cap affecting are
true newbies, the ones who log on and are afraid of everything :)  With
easy access portals right in their home towm, I feel they are going to be
missing out on a lot of what makes the game great, the excitement and
uncertainty of travel and the rewarding feeling when you get to your
destination safely.

Unfortunately I do not think this will really alleviate that, people will
just get to those zones faster.  Which goes back to my point.  It just
seems that people dont explore or really experience many new things
anymore in Everquest.  For most it comes down to getting XP as fast as
possible.
