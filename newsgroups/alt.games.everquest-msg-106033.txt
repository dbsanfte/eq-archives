Oh Yeah!  Happened to me week before last, on Tuesday.  I was sitting
there medding in the Karana Spires and BAM.

LOADING...PLEASE WAIT!

And then nothing happened for like 5 minutes.  So I used <CTRL><ESC> to
crash back to windows and restarted the game.  I get to the character
selection screen and notice that my character is indeed in the Nexus on
Luclin.

WHAT?!!!!!!

I don't have Luclin.  I've not registered it and don't have any of the
files for it.

Try to log on anyway.  No good.  
It just locks up my system again.

So, I restart the game again and log on another character.  Send a
petition and wait.  1 & 1/2 hours to 2 hours later, I'm still waiting. 
Finally log and go to bed.
Next evening, I log on again and send another petition.  An hour or 2
later, I get a tell from a guide.  It goes something like 'I can't help
you with that.  You'll have to send email to the head GM at
xxxxxxxxx@yyyyyyyyyyy(some sony address).
OK, so I log off and send the email.  I wait an hour by the email
program and give up waiting to go play the alternate for a little while
before bed.

Next evening, Thursday, my main is still in Nexus.  I log the alternate
and petition again.

(NOTE: I was very careful to remain civil, considerate, and nice in all
my petitions and the email.)

An hour or so later, another guide contacts me saying something like
'He/she will try to fix it and/or contact a GM but not to hold my
breath.'

I play a little longer and then log for the evening.

I had to go out of town for the Easter weekend so I couldn't get back on
till Sunday.  But, someone finally smiled on me.  There was an answer
from that head GM and my character was back at my bind point.

The moral:  Like the first poster said, be careful in the spires.  You
could loose access to that character for 4 days or longer.

Personal moral:  I'm a 24th degree wizard but when I teleport to a
spires, I run like a scared rabbit.
