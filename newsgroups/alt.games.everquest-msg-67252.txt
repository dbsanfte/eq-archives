From what I've read up on Beastlords, they seem to be targeted as the
most pet dependant class of all. A large proportion of their spells are
targeted at their pets: Heals, buffs, etc. They also seem to be the
strongest pets. This give me the image of someone standing back, letting
their pet do the majority of the work in dealing/taking damamge, with
the actual PC being a one-man cleric/enc/shaman support to the pet
melee/tank
