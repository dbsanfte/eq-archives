I'll be hanging out as well. We are going to do one more upgrade to
Tiru's machine (or replace, whichever is easier) to match mine, but
that's it. I'm done adding on crap for EQ. I have no plans to sign on
for PoP, and am frankly hoping that a lot of the other post fifty guilds
on our server head there en' masse, thereby freeing up various
zones/camps that we have trouble grabbing at times. *cough* Velks/Seb
Guard *cough*.

And when EQ2 comes out, if tons of higher level players want to head on
out for the greener pastures, I'll be there at the exit portal with
rcsmiley asking if I can have their stuff before they go.
