I'm assuming you're talking about the Blue Monster.  There's also the 
Great White, Gold, Red, and Silver.

All of the courses there are absolutely gorgeous.  The Blue Monster is 
stunning.  Well worth the trip and greens fees.

No idea.  But changing your clubs as you play a PGA course for the first 
time doesn't seem like a recipe for success.

Depends on the course.  I've played the Blue Monster and Silver courses 
in the past.  18 on the Blue Monster is the accepted toughest hole at 
the resort.  But, frankly, unless you're a scratch golfer you're going 
to struggle with all of the holes.  Go for the experience, not the score.

I can't imagine playing virtual golf on an Xbox making any difference in 
the world to your play.  Do like the rest of us and plot your strategy 
from the score card.  Then throw it all away and just enjoy the day. :-)

Have fun!
