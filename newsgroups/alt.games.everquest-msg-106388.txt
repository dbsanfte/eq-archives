  It seems to me that the "recommended level" thing that Absor just
described in a post referenced by eq.castersrealm.com, does more or less the
same thing, except in a different way.  Though not all weapons have a
recommended level, when they arguably should.

  But, whatever.  I never realized how much twinking bothered me until I
started playing on FV, where there are virtually no twinks.  I enjoy this
because when somebody sees my character decked out in full Darkforge (and
looking GOOD in it, I might add), I get all sorts of compliments and they
know that I assembled the set on my own.  If this character were on another
server (except perhaps Sullon Zek or Rallos Zek), most people probably
wouldn't even notice my character admist all the twinks, and I might even
get passed off as another twink (either self-twinked, or guild-twinked.)

  But I know that whatever happens, twinking will never stop.  I know that
whatever they do to "nerf" twinking won't directly effect me, so I don't
really care.  Twinking, for me, adds nothing to the gaming experience, it
only takes away from it.  I do think it would be better for "game balance"
to institute some sort of game mechanics that make twinking less beneficial.
