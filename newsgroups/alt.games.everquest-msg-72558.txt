I just completed a new system:

K7S5A motherboard (9/01 BIOS, as received) $90
AMD Athlon XP1700+  $180
1GB PC2100 DDR memory (2x512) $335
Visiontek Gforce3TI200 $215
CompUSA tower chassis with 400w power supply $108
IBM 60GXP 60GB 7200RPM UDMA5 hard drive $135
Lite-On 16x cd writer $120
Panasonic 1/4" floppy $13
Generic AMR 56k modem $13
Misc cables, mouse, keyboard, etc  approx $50

(All prices include tax, shipping, credit card surcharges, etc)

This computer, which runs Microsoft Windows XP Professional, is destined to
play Everquest/Luclin around ten hours per day, every day. We're running on
a network with 384k SDSL. Although it is a tad early to tell for sure,
everything seems to run quite well. I didn't experience any major problems
during assembly.. Since I didn't have all the parts at the same time, I
started assembly with one stick of 128MB sdram and a 3GB hard drive. I
cloned the hard drive with Norton Ghost 2002 after I purchased the IBM.

The only variable is the video card. If this one isn't adequate, I might
have to return it (to Best Buy) and purchase the 500, which will set me back
another $150.

I haven't benchmarked this system, but my initial subjective evaluation is
that it is very, very fast.
