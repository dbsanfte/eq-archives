Forgot to add to my other post.  Not just a skill, but something that
requires components, like archery.  Maybe requiring some cheap stuff that
can be bought at the rogue guild, and parts getting more expensive
(SLIGHTLY, not like archery), but do significantly more damage (damage
increases at about same as cost, the way spell damage to mana cost does).
Possibly spider silk threads, or a special rope or line?  Maybe various
traps, not just fire, but maybe buy fishing supplies, fashion them into a
line & hook trap.  Later a barbed ball, or eventually land mine types.
Soon, with enough skill, more expensive and harder to make AoE traps.
