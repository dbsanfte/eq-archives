I saw a person in Freeport, near the PoK book, talked to her, but don't know
if she's "The One" -

I was able to get the woman in Halas to talk to me, but I can't find the
second person.  I went to EC tunnel, and talked to everyone, but no one
would ask questions...  A friend told me to be sure to talk to the BARD, so
I'm going back tonite to double check...  If it doesn't work, you'll see me
in line at WK...  (where are they in WK?)
