   Not to mention the occasional (or regular, if I am playing) mistell from
someone thinking they are in guild chat or whatnot.  Luckily it's not a big deal
when this happens.  For some reason, it seems that the regulars of age channel
are used to this sort of thing.

   Yep.  If I am busy watching health bars and being the ghetto CC, then someone
could ask something like "Teapray, is it true what says about you on the SOE
website about you being a killstealing, ninja-looting training cleric that never
ever casts a heal?"  and  I wouldn't say word one about it.  Still, the funny
thing is that I feel a greater connection to most of the regulars of age channel
than I do with my own guild.

   First death on my first group in a plane!  I take comfort in knowing that
there was nothing I could have done to prevent the wipe, it was an unfortunate
pull that we all knew was going to end the way it did.  But it feel odd to be
watching more than one or two health bars.  I think I've been duoing with Lenny
too.  We're pressing now to level him up, so that we can form stable groups with
others.

   It depends what everyone is doing, of course.  And there can be a long lag
between when someone asks a question of someone, and when they get answer. 
Heck, since I have age channel going to it's own window, I've been known to
reply to something someone has said literally hours ago.  Of course, when I do
that, most just assume that I'm doing another mistell.

   I've used the /market channel on FV to get answers for age before.  And used
/age to answer questions asked in /market.  It's a better system than using any
stupid prima guide.
