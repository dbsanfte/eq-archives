Decent AC and MR would cost a fortune
Most BP's with MR have only small amounts unless the AC is poor (Sarnak
Emblazoned Tabard for example AC14 +35hp +10MR)

DF is the best you can look at for the moment if you want both
AC20 +10 stam +3MR Will cost about 800pp (maybe less now)
or obtained via this quest

Or just for pure AC the Enamel Black Breast Plate about the same price but
AC25, no stats
Drops in L Guk

Other than that, as you are human you can wear Flayed Skin (You'll look a
bit like prince in his purple rain days if you wear a full suit)

The Tunic is AC 16, +20hp +5 on all saves -2cha
It drops in Karnors so you won't be looting any yet but the sale price has
fallen a lot. Tunic should be 200 or less.
