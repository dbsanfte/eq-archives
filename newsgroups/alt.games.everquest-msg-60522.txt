In the two sources I've looked at so far, the cleric epic is described
in a very linear fashion.

Many of my friends who aren't clerics work on and off on their epics
every now and then as they get time and/or people available.

Here's the list as I see it on
http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/walkthrough/index.htm


         Obtain "Lord Bergurgle's Crown" from Lord Bergurgle and give it
to Shmendrik Lavawalker, triggering spawn of Natasha Whitewater.
         Natasha Whitewater will kill Shmendrik Lavawalker, then "a
spirit of flame" will spawn and attack you.
         Loot "Damaged Goblin Crown" from "a spirit of flame" and give
it to Natasha Whitewater to receive "Ornate Sea Shell (I)".

**Advice listed elsewhere noted that Natasha will try to help kill the
spirit of flame if you do it this way, and if she gets the kill you
don't get the crown.  OK, so I killed Shmendrik, spawned the spirit,
killed that, and now have one little piece of my epic, the "Damaged
Goblin Crown."  I still need to spawn Natasha with the crown from Lord
Bergurgle, but when I do I won't need to worry about who kills the
spirit of Flame.**


         Give "Ornate Sea Shell (I)" to Omat Vastsea to receive "Coral
Statue of Tarew".
         Give "Coral Statue of Tarew" to "a seeker", kill resulting
"Plasmatic Priest" spawn, loot "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe".

**This seems to require that I follow the normal flow**

         Kill Lord Gimblox in Solusek A, loot "Lord Gimblox's Signet
Ring".

**This step, though, seems entirely independant of the first ones, looks
like if I like I can go do it now.**

         Turn in "Blood Soaked Plasmatic Priest Robe" to Omat Vastsea,
receiving "Orb of Frozen Water" and causing Natasha Whitewater to spawn.

         Turn in "Lord Gimblox's Signet Ring" to Natasha Whitewater to
receive "Ornate Sea Shell (II)".

**OK, reading along, I need to have done all the previous steps before
doing either of those two... without both the robe and the ring in my
possession, I fail here.**

         Turn in "Ornate Sea Shell (II)" to Naxot Deepwater, receiving
"Message to Natasha".
         Kill resulting spawn of Ixiblat Fer, loot "Sceptre of Ixiblat
Fer".

**More of the linear stuff**

         Kill Overking Bathezid Di'Zok, loot "Singed Scroll".

**Seems to be another independant step, I can do this now without having
done any other part of the quest.**

         Turn in "Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer" and "Singed Scroll" to Omat
Vastsea, receiving "Orb of Clear Water" and causing Natasha Whitewater
to spawn.
         Give "Message to Natasha" to Natasha Whitewater to receive
"Shimmering Pearl".

**Linear, need all the previous parts.**

         Give "Shimmering Pearl" to Zordak Ragefire, kill him and
resulting Zordakalicus Ragefire spawn, loot "Heart of Zordak Ragefire".

**Linear again.**

         Turn in "Heart of Zordak Ragefire" to Omat Vastsea, receiving
"Orb of Vapor" and causing Jhassad Oceanson to spawn.

**Linear**

         Give "Orb of Frozen Water", "Orb of Clear Water", and "Orb of
Vapor" to Jhassad Oceanson, receiving "Orb of the Triumvirate" and
causing Avatar of
         Water to spawn.
         Give "Orb of the Triumvirate" to Avatar of Water, receiving the
Water Sprinkler of Nem Ankh.

**Yep, linear here too.**

So, I can:

Kill Shmendrik/spirit  of flame
Kill Lord Gimblox
Kill Overking Bathezid Di'Zok
and Kill Lord Bergurgle

in any order and without any other steps, to help set myself up for
doing the rest of the epic.
