If this isn't in the FAQ for this group, it should be. Must get asked at
least monthly.  But no, you're limited to one line in the hotkeys, so
you can't do a long acution that way. The people that you see running
the same long auctions over and over are typing it once, hitting enter,
then using the Shift-Up Arrow to get the last line of text back in the
chat window and hitting enter. As long as you aren't chatting with other
folks inbetween auctions it works fine.
