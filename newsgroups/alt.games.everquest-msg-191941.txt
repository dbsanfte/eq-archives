    I walked my rogue into the encampment with Hide/Sneak, dropped Hide
behind the vendor, and purchased all the spells. Now that's not an Enchanter
method, but it is a method with a mule. Time for your Hole mules to get out
and see the world!

    Don't know that the faction shift would be big enough. The Brownies
scowl, and Collaboration (the level 51 spell) only does a 300 point shift.
Now if the brownies were made a little more friendly to people, it could
become doable with Benevolence (200 point shift) at level 20. Given the
first two mana vial spells come at 12 and 20, that wouldn't be so long a
wait. Set the vendors to Beta Neutral, so they could be dealt with without
casting Benevolence again (or see below), and you could set the brownies to
be global 200 points lower than lowest Dubious.

    You have greatly misunderstood how Alliance-line works. When cast on a
mob of faction X, you gain however many points of faction with X for as long
as you stay in the zone. If you cast on another mob, you lose the benefits
of the first spell and gain the benefits of the second. So, for example, if
you were in Kael and were glares to both Kromrif and Kromzek, you couldn't
stand in a room with both types of mobs and have them both tolerate you.
That's why moving the brownie vendors to a neutral faction would be
required. If they were still on Brownie, they'd stay Dubious after
Benevolence. And if they were any other faction that started Dubious or
lower, the ENC would get pasted by the brownies when they went to
Benevolence the vendor.
