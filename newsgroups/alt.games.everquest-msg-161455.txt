Your skills, and being in the right place on the network. The #1
problem with MM FPS is dealing with lag. Actually the #1 problem
with multiplayer FPS in general, outside of a LAN or dedicated
network context.

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
 a rigged demo."

EQ and AC/DAOC are real systems, now operating in the real
world. They have had their flaws thoroughly explored by a very
large number of people, and so those flaws are very thoroughly
known.

Neocron is in *beta*, and the computer press in general tends
to be kind to beta releases; they assume that the problems will
be fixed, and possibly new features added. When the truth is
more usually that *some* problems will be fixed, some new
features will be added, some new *problems* will be added,
and for a MM game there's the ever-present possibility that
everything will seize up when the second "M" ("massively") is
added to the first ("multiplayer"). It's certainly happened before.
AFAIK the number of largely problem-free MMORPG releases
can be counted on the fingers of one... finger. (*)

Plus the ever-present issue of what happens when the usual mix
of antisocial retards join the game. Protecting the players who
are there to enjoy the game from those who are there to enjoy
ruining the game for everyone else is another point that few games
get right.

I hate it already. Mainly because I'm not fond of FPS, but
also the hype machine is in overdrive on this, which is never
a good sign.

However, I hope that it does work out well. Mainly because
it reduces the chances of us sharing a virtual world. :-) The
things you get excited about just don't match with the things
I get excited about.

(*) Dark Age of Camelot, from what I've heard. But I
haven't played it. Mainly read numerous accounts of
surprise that somebody finally got a launch right.
