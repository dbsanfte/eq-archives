I can't see how a bard would quit after getting an epic.  The game
just gets *better* as an epic bard.  You're more powerful, you're more
desirable, and you're even better looking (bards are already so damn
handsome that it oughtta be illegal).  
A cleric I can see, because of the nightmare you have to endure to get
Ragefire, and the realization that you are gonna sit on your ass and
CHeal until you get to rez, at least if you follow conventional
wisdom.  We have an epic SK, but he's rather quiet, so other than the
fact that I've grouped with him at least 100 times, and done most of
his epic twice (failed the final step due to bad luck), I have no idea
if the epic is worthwhile for SKs.  I know he still keeps a 2hp weapon
so that when he's FD, it looks like he's polevaulting the raid.
