He wasn't talking about newbie guards. He was talking about guards in a
city.
Big difference really when getting exp.

Who needs a rez from level 1 to 9 ?
Death is good in that you keep fighting until you run out of health and/
mana.
Die boom back to fighting non stop

Those guards are too low level.
You are confusing city guards as protecting newbies.
Seeing as there is nothing to kill in a city for a noob higher than lvl 2
there is no concern.
Do city guards even aggro on the rats ? I dont think so.
I ***think*** city guards just watch noobs die if they cant kill a rat.
