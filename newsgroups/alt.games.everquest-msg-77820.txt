Primary tank group is a good basic plan.. but the only members that
have to be in it are a cleric and the MA.  The other four members
of the group can be anything at all, although a bard if available should
also be included, as his buffs hit only his group members and his
mana feed also hits only his group members.

Cleric in MA group is a very good idea, as this means he constantly
has the MA HP bar in view, even while trolling around using /assist
to see who else in the raid needs heals.  On the other hand, unless you
are flooded with clerics, a second cleric in the same group is almost
certainly a luxury you can't afford.  Clerics in the other groups will
be using /assist and should also have the MA and SA both on
hotkey targetting so as to provide needed opportunity heals, but
spreading them out so as to provide more "group HP bar monitoring"
is a much better plan.

Here you break down completely.  Aggro is raid based, not group
based.  The reason a group is built within a raid is not aggro based.
MT group will not have aggro... MA will have aggro and is in MT
group.  Being placed with the MA isn't going to pull aggro off
the slower or mezzer or heck, nuke crazed wizzy.  Only good
aggro management will do this.  If anything, put the high aggro
non assists in seperate groups where they can be watched by their
own healers who aren't quite as committed to the MA survival.

You start out describing the SA group... but then you don't build one.
SA group is similar to MA group; you need a tank who can get and
hold aggro and survive, and a healer dedicated to keeping him alive.
This is needed because there are mobs that cannot be mezed, and
because MAs sometimes die.  It is best to put SA in a seperate group
because of the "dedicated healer" portion of the job; if you do end up
with two mobs being fought at once, a MT group containing both
MA and SA is going to be dividing the attentions of its healers.

The puller can be placed in either MA or SA group.  In the MA group
he'll have easier communication with the MA and primary healer.  In
the SA group, he'll have a group healer who has slightly more spare
time and attention to keep him filled back up on HP before he goes
out again to pull the next mob.

Nuker group isn't a very good plan.  Only reason to work things
this way would be if there was a bard or two dedicated to the group.
Otherwise, you have a custom built KS group, who will be sorely
tempted to overnuke in order to get the exp.  Overnuking means
downtime medding, means being LOM when the nukes are really
needed, means time wasted when mobs aggro on the nukers and kill
them... Unless forced to congregate nukers around the marvelous
mana batteries (and bards are probably more useful surrounded by
tanks during combat, anyway) its a better plan to spread these guys
out one to a group... particularly as you note, to put a porter in with
each group for ease of transport.

Aggro is the biggest job of a raid... concentrate all damage on the
MA (and perhaps SA) who can efficiently and effectively be kept
alive by your healers with a minimum of fuss and bother.  Every
time a mob turns and attacks someone other than the designated
sponge, it means -more- hp damage is being taken ( rarely does anyone
have higher AC than the MA, thats why you picked him!) and
healer attention is being spread around needlessly... plus with some
mobs other much nastier things will happen if it starts moving around.

Bard haste stacks with Item haste and chanter/shaman haste.  Hasted
tanks swing more often, doing more damage in the time that the target
mob is beating on them.  Nine times out of ten its Haste and other tank
buffs that are the best use of a bard -during- combat.

Pets are situational, there are many places where they are not welcome,
but others where they are your best tools.  Worse than fear are
mez breaking pets, this is the primary reason they are unwelcome.
Mez is one of the most important tools in many a raid, and pets that
decide to defend their masters by breaking mez can kill a raid fast.

Epic cleric can die, he won't need mana to res.  If you want to camp
out a cleric and have free range to pick, take a 56+ cleric without
epic.  Now use him to res the epic cleric and you are back in
business.  Better plan, though, is to get a Staff of Forbidden Rites
(or whatever its called) and hand it to a high level monk.  This is
a ten charge item that will do 96% res... and again, you only need
to res -one- cleric with it, and only if you had a total wipeout
that killed every cleric  you have.  That stick should last thru a couple
dozen raids easily, as you'll find good tactics mean that its rare
you don't get at least one cleric out alive.

Evac bad.  Evac kills raids and generates a lot of angry raiders.  Evac
is for group hunting, in a raid you rely on your fellow raiders to prevent
a total wipeout, and your clerics to res you and get you back on your
feet.  Evac a group out and suddenly the rest of the raid is short a quarter of

its contingent.  You'll almost never see an evac before at least a few
people are dead... so this means those people need to be resed up
anyway.  By leaving you make it difficult to survive to res them, turning
the raid into a CR instead of a simple recovery.

Two high level tanks, two decent clerics, at least one good shaman and
one good chanter and one good monk and you have the core of a good
raid group.  If possible you want one cleric per group in the raid, but failing

this high level (look for Superior Heal at a minimum if you have level 50+
characters along) druids and shaman can fill in the gaps.  Other classes
are raw material that can be utilized with good tactics, but their exact
composition isn't as crucial.  Ability to sponge up damage, restore HP
efficiently, haste the MA, slow the target, and control the crowd, those
are all vital... and nothing beats a monk for pulling in targets one at a time.

Clerics are good, but not the end all be all... once you get a few,
getting in a bard, necro, rogue, heck, at least one high level of every
class will give you a lot of versatility.
