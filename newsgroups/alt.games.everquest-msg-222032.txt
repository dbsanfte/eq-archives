Did something last night that I haven't done in a long time - bailed from a
group without warning.

If you meet Shadowslayerer (yes, erer) on Xegony, avoid him like the plague.
He's twinked, PLed, and incompetent.  He's Level 28 and has a Hide / Evade
skill of 30.  I didn't find out his BS skill, but given that he spent most
of his time fighting *beside* me, I've my doubts.  In most of the combats,
neither the 28(?) Ranger nor I (26 Warrior, maxxed Taunt) could pull aggro
off this guy.  And given his pathetic Evade skill he couldn't move it off to
us.

The team was 6, Warrior 26, Rogue 28, Ranger 28, Wizard 28, Wizard 29,
Shaman 30 (as best I recall).  We were in the main basement in HH, holding
it and the Lookout room.  As lowest, my leaving was minimal effect.  In
retrospect, maybe I should have stayed, but I get really ticked when an
idiot tells me that I'm incompetent.

I figured that he didn't know what he was doing from various things:

He'd immediately attack things near walls, not waiting for me to pull them
away from the wall first so he'd have more rear area to work from.

He'd fight from any old position that happened, in front, from the sides, or
from behind.  He'd never move to always be opposite me.

He never stopped attacking, even when being pounded.

He never blinked out while resting, showing that either he was maxxed on
Hide or wasn't practicing it.


After watching this for a while, I offered to teach him (I have a 42 Rogue,
so I know something about running one, and I've taught clueless Rogues
before).  His response was "I suppose so, but it's not my fault that you
can't hold aggro".  At that point I disbanded and left.
