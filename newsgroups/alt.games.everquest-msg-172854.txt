I haven't played EverQuest yet so I can't comment on that.  However, I think
Asherons Call 2 has a really good look and feel about it.  I don't have a
really high specification computer but it runs very smoothly on mine, even
at higher resolutions.

It's still a youngster compared to EverQuest so I think the game needs to
stew a while and evolve.

The biggest problem with Ashersons Call 2 is the server I've been playing
on, Dawnsong, is constantly up and down.  It has come to a point where I've
decided to try EverQuest instead.

My copy of EverQuest New Dawn and EverQuest Planes of Power arrived in the
post this morning so I'm looking forward to installing and playing that
within the next few days.  Not Thursday obviously, but soon.

Ian
