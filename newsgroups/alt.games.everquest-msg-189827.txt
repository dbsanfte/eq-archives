The opposite can be said also.
There are many players out there that have absolutely no idea what a bard
does.
We can tank, we can heal, we can be a mini KEI, we can debuff etc etc.
In a group that needs a tank, **Waves hand**, in a group that needs a healer
**Waves hand**  etc etc!!
People wonder what the point of someone playing a lute is good for.....

I've brought alot of friends into this game.  Some have enjoyed it, some
have not, but regardless I always suggest a melee type.

Being a warrior broke me of any bad habits I could have had before I even
started my
other characters.  Its been often commented on (just an example) how nice it
is that my cleric / wizard / necro does not run but trusts in the tanks to
get the mob off me.
