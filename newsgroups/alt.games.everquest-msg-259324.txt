I've been a DSL user forever but recently learned that my cable company 
offers IP and it's a lot cheaper than my DSL service. So, I'm considering 
switching.

I currently enjoy 768 up and down speed and, as I understand my cable 
service, I'll be getting double the bandwidth for downloads but only a third 
of the bandwidth for uploads. My primary issue is online game performance 
and I've always enjoyed the fact that my uploads back to the game servers 
are just as fast as my downloads from them. So now I'm wondering what effect 
a switch will have on this experience. My sense is that this will be not 
only Ok, but probably very favorable to me, since most game client uploads 
are probably small and tokenized triggers and not very bandwidth 
constrained. Latency would be a bigger issue. On this front, I'm a little 
concerned about the queuing up of packets that occurs when a cable hub gets 
saturated with a lot of users, something I don't have to worry about with my 
dedicated DSL circuit.

I posted some of these questions on alt.dcom.xdsl and alt.cable.ip, but got 
only a couple of replies and they didn't sound like very experienced gamers. 
I'm curious what other *gamers* have experienced on this topic. Not asking 
for a DSL vs Cable flamewar here, just some opinions on the relative 
tradeoffs of both for online gaming, and hoping that a discussion will flesh 
out some good thoughts. Thanks.
