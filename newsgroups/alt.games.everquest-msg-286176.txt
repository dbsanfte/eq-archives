Nothing specific, I'm just curious as to how many EQ players have
tried VG or are currently playing it.

And if you're playing it *instead* of EQ that would be interesting as
well.

I moved from EQ to VG primarily because friends did.  They like the
crafting better, diplomacy is cool, and it's newer/shinier.  The last
part plays very little into the reason, crafting was the single
biggest reason I think.
Personally I hated crafting in EQ, EQ2, and still do in VG.  Crafting
to me is too much like work so I just kill bozo's.

But if they had not moved to VG I would still be playing EQ.  I only
have time for one and playing an ok game with friends is better than
playing a better game with strangers.
I think VG will rival EQ (in my brain anyway) but it will be a year or
so.
