Subject: Re: Do You Want To Know For Sure That You Are Going To Heaven? The
 reason some people don't know for sure if they are going to Heaven when
 they die is because they just don't know. The good news is that you can
 know for sure that you are going to Heaven which is described in the Holy
 Bible as a beautiful place with no death, sorrow, sickness or pain.
