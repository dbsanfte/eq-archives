All discussion about the value of Smithing aside. There are just as many
arguments for as against. Suppose one decides to take this up as a trade. I
have done alot of research on the recipies and the methods and the places to
smith. I think I have all the info that I need for that type of tactical
step. My question is something that most of the sites and FAQ's I have seen
don't address. How do I fund this trade? Are people selling their wares back
to the NPC's or to other PC's? Unlike tailoring where you can pick up the
raw materials by looting pelts, smithing makes you buy the raw material.
It almost seems like you need another trade, ie baking batwing crunchies or
fish rolls, to fund Smithing. Am I missing something?

On another note, I have seen at some vendors, books for smithing. Do you
have to buy these? Some sites say that it helps your chances of being
successful. Some sites say that you don't have to buy these and it is just a
myth they have to be in your inventory. If they do have to be in your
inventory, do they physically have to be on you or can they be in your
account at the bank?

Thanks in advance for any help!
