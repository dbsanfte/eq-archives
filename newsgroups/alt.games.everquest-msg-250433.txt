   I will defer to Remington on this one.  I'd heard that there was a high
ZEM there, and I just sorta believed it to be true.  But it could very well
be that just the rumor of such was what was bringing so many of us in.

   I do remember though, the place emptied out about the exact same time
that Luclin came out.  As you said, zones like the Paladal  Caverns do
indeed help sell expansions.
