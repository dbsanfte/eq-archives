$20-$50 on ebay the other day when I checked....

hmm, I don't know about that, I still think someone would have a  really
hard time getting anymore then their original purchase price from a
lawsuit...
So it was probably more like "OK, we'll shut these people up real quick,
refunds, character wipes, done"

No warning? Ok, maybe for people that don't know anything about
computers...But anyone that has any gaming or computer experience can look
at the screenshots and GUESS that a Pentium 200 is not going to run the
game....
Then they post recommended machine requirements(a few months ago?) and that
just gives it all away...To me, the no warning would only apply to
windows95(dx8.1) and again, why anyone would WANT to run 95 over 98 just
boggles the mind....

I think it would rare to find a lawyer, first, that can't afford to upgrade
him/herself, second, going to spend their own time and money to pursue a
lawsuit...Not impossible, just rare in this case.....
