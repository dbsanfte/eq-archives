Got some Skinspike potions, which have a 1.5 sec cast duration. 
Drinking one of these while mid melody stops the melody, and you can't 
restart it or start a single song for a little while afterwards; I was 
getting the  same message that a normal caster will if he clicks a spell 
during the 2 second greyed out period you get when you can't cast a new 
spell just yet.

Insta click potions don't seem to have this effect, I tried several. 
Hmm, I'll have to get my old Spyglass out of deep storage and try that.
