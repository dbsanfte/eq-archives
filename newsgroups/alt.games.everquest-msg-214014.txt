That would help a bit, but its still going to be seeing two resist checks, while
Ensnare sees only one.  Two checks, both at -20, versus one at regular... well I
don't know which would stick more.  Also, is there no high level druid snare to
replace Ensnare with that has a similar neg to resist component?  (maybe there
isn't, I'm not conversant with the high level druid spells.. but it would seem odd
if their snare line stops cold with a level 29 spell)

What level is the final necro snare anyway?  Druids finally get a no damage root up
around level 62 or so...
