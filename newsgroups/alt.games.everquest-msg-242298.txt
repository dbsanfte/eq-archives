Well it was pretty useful for farming. I pointed him at something and
then looted it while he was beating up the next one. Sped things up
considerably, considering that my combat skills are crap right now,
and it takes 2 or 3 hits to kill even the newbie mobs in everfrost. In
a few more levels my DD will cause enough damage to kill a newbie mob
in a single hit, and be cheep enough in regards to my mana pool and
regeneration, that I can farm with it, but until then the charmed pet
works pretty well. Now if only I could figure out how to tell him to
kill everything that walks past us...
