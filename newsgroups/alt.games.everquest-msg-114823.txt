    Depends on what he's managed to charm (where he is). The fungusbeasts in
Fungus Grove don't have the damage output he needs to solo if he can't get
them quadding, for example, because they take too much damage and regen it
back very slowly. That's his primary concern when Dire Charm soloing: how to
get the pet's health back up. Usually the best way is just to make sure it
deals a ton of damage. There are places where one can get a pet that heals
itself (Velk's), but they're rare.
