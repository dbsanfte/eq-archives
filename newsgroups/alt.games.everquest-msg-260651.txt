Why the devs gave them a mana regeneration spell line too,
is beyond me,was a Shaman with a real pet not powerful enough?

On the other hand there are Berserkers,I feel with them,chain
armour class with roughly the same damage output like a 
Ranger and worse utilities(if this is possible :p). 

Maybe someone should told the marketing department of SOE
that numbers are NOT everything,and that balanced classes can
help too to keep the game alive,for example Starcraft or Diablo2.
