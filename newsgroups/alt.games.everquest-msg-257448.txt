My mouse pointer locks up if an Everquest window is active when I
zone/log in/do something else that makes the mouse pointer go away in
EQ, but apart from those times it works fine, and if I time it right I
can often avoid it even when zoning (autorun, or click a stone and
Alt-Tab out before it reacts).

There are (probably) more PvP players than Mac players, and even those
got a patch.  :-)

Weren't there just as many zones for any given level range before,
except 60-65 which didn't get any?  At least I got a popup every five
levels telling me which was the next hot spot I should go to.
