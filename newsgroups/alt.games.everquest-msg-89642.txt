At level 12 I had a full set of banded for my troll warrior, all
bought from other players. By level 14 I had replaced half of it with
BRonze Plate, also bought off other players.

I then switched servers in the great character exodus to Antonius
Bayle (from Drinal). Now I havve a troll of level 21 and I can't buy
'low level' armour anywhere. It seems that on AB at least smithing is
a failing art. No one sells it anymore.

Even though my Troll has about 40 cha and 65 Int I am considering
taking up smithing, just so that I can get hold of some armour.

So don't bonk too hard (ahem) you may find it harder than you would
expect to buy what you want.
