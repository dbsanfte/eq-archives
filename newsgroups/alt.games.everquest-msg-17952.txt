The apostrophe just requires a petition and short wait, altho they often use
` instead of  '
Personally I would reconsider the surname because without the apostrophe it
reads as Shiter :ï¿½/

Speaking of unfortunate names, one of my RL friends has SK Called Spanner,
seems a harmless enough name, not conventional but not really that lame, a
German  member of our Guild always found it funny, when asked why he
explained that Spanner in Germany is a slang for Paedophile, oops.
