Long ago my third PnP character ever was an AD&D Monk.  He "won".
That is, he recovered an ancient holy artifact and was thereupon
taken bodily into the hereafter, along with the artifact.  Since
then, I have played many Paladins and an assortment of Warriors,
Rogues (or as we used to call them: Thieves), and spellcasters.
But I have never felt the urge to reprise my role as a Monk.

Kaev <--- whose first character was a Half-Elf Thief in a campaign
whose GM followed the direction to "make up your own rules" in the
ancient (i.e. pre-DnD) Chainmail rules booklet.
