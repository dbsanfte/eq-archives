Sorry, but after getting a group in, say, Everfrost is NOT the time
to be saying "well, maybe we should go to ....."  Also, you don't suppose
they invited you without knowing their weaknesses do you?

If guaranteeing a win means not playing, then yes.

Mine don't, my BL has no losses.  All my mage's losses date back to
the early days of LDoN.  This is PU groups and Groups of regulars.

Some people are too cautious - because a loss would look bad.  "Oh
dear, I won't just dive in and see how we do, because if we decide
to bail it'll show up on my record."  Dive in, see if you can do it,
should be clear within a few minutes if your group can hack it.

We do 65 normals with 5 people, a BL tank, root CC and a pulling 
technique best described as "Pull 'em all and let Inny sort 'em 
out."
 
Last week I had one good sized block of playing time (5 hours,
Thursday morning).  And due to the kind of prissy "Oh dear, we
might get a boo boo" attitude that this guy showed, I lost over
1/3rd of that sitting on my ass.  I have no patience for that
anymore.  My response to that these days is "ok, gluck on that you
guys" and /disb /LFG.  Funny thing since I switched to a BL - I get 
tells for groups within a few minutes of going /LFG.  This morning I 
got one within 1 minute, then another before I could turn it off.
