Beastlord. Traditional duty: melee damage output. Other roles: a variety of
other things, depending on situation and group lineup. Beastlord is perhaps
the ultimate "jack of all trades" class, hence they are arguably the best
solo class in the game (calm down necromancers and druids, I said
"arguably"). In a group setting the beastlord is unlikely to be the first
choice for any single role, his value is being able to plug in to any of
several.
   A beastlord is a good DPS class (counting the pet of course), and gets
enough HP to be a good "off-tank" (pull an add aside and pound it down some
while the rest of the group finishes the first mob). Armor class and lack of
taunt makes a beastlord a poor primary tank (can't wear heavy armor), but in
a pinch they can step in. A beastlord gets some heals, a fair assortment of
shaman-type buffs, and with some skill can use his pet for crowd control
(because the pet does taunt). Later in life the beastlord gets slow and
haste spells, and a highly-prized line of group mana/HP regeneration buffs
popularly referred to as "kittycrack." A beast even gets some DoTs and
nukes, tho the nukes are rarely worth their mana cost in a group situation.
LDoN adventuring, where a group hasn't room for a specialist for every job,
has been a real boon for beastlords: a single class that can melee, DoT,
slow, haste, help heal in a bad spot, offtank, even help a bit with crowd
control, is _very_ useful for assembling workable LDoN lineups. High-end
raid groups tend not to value beastlords that much, tend to see them as
"master of none" (a large raid group will always have a better haster, a
better slower, some better DPS classes, certainly better tanks and healers,
etc.).
   Most beastlords solo their way through much of the first 50 levels, which
they can do faster than almost any other class. The way to develop the full
assortment of skills to become a highly valued group member is to mix up how
you spend that solo time: do plenty of brute-force soloing (where you and
the pet are both meleeing the mob directly) and also spend some quality time
playing pet-cleric (safer, slower soloing where you mostly let the pet do
the work and stay back healing the pet and DoTing/nuking the mob). That way
you will develop the full range of tactics and skills to plug yourself into
whatever role each group needs you to perform, and that versatility is what
will make you most popular as a groupmate.
