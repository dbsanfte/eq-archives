Heh. I pay 150 pp a pop for KEI, since this price will often get
people with the four-hour variety to speak up. Sometimes, I get it
cast on my rogue and cleric together, log the cleric out while the
rogue does tradeskills with the +25 INT/WIS until it runs out, then
log the cleric back in once the rogue's KEI wears off.

This has helped me get my fletching to 210.
