Brad McQuaid (Verant) is wrong on this issue.

Player accounts were banned without warning for a first-time offense. 
This directly contradicts their stated policy that players should be
warned.  Perhaps Verant should change the policy:

"accounts may be banned at random at the sole discretion of Verant if
any player action is arbitrarily determined to violate any published,
unpublished, notional, or imaginary exploit or if players through
smart teamwork and coordination manage to defeat a zone that was
intended for a higher number of adventurers.  More specifically,
accounts may be banned if players take any intelligent action to
defeat mobs that was not carefully foreseen or planned by Verant.  In
addition, any players who had any association with the players accused
of the exploit may also be banned or deguilded at random.  More
generally, if any player upsets any Verant monitor in any way he or
she may be immediately banned without warning"
