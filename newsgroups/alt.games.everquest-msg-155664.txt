If anybody ever tries doing something that looks like flirting,
I inform them that the character is female but the "driver" is
male. I don't want to lead anybody on and risk hurting
somebody's feelings.

I do a certain amount of roleplaying the character's gender,
but don't let it get out of control - mainly things like blushing
at compliments. I tend to RP my characters pretty close to
my RL personality anyway - even, or perhaps especially,
the female; my (male) dwarf paladin is a bit gruff but my
halfling cleric is very much sweetness-and-light. And I *like*
being nice to people. Drive-by buffs and free rezzes a
specialty. :-)

But basically getting hit upon has never been a big problem.
Maybe being a halfling is part of it; my character's been called
cute any number of times, but otherwise no major problems
(and I'm not sure that being called cute is a problem).

        ...Ronny
