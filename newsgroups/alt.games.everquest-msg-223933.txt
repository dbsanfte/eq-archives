Known bug; Vah Shir models are bugged to hell and back againm in fact.
Here is what you do, annoying as it is. And no, I am NOT joking. :/ 

First, change your breed graphic. Then, uneqeuip and reequip any
equipment slots that are not showing up correctly; arms down and pants
are the main ones that bug on my kitty. Then, change your breed back.
Then zone. You should now be good for that login session.

Annoying as hell, but there's the fix. :/
