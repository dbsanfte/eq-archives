I'm in the same boat as you- just got the Ti500.  But I'm not getting a GF4
for a long long time.  EQ is really all I play, and 20 second zone times are
fine.  But then, I have never done a real raid, so I can't speak for that
performance.  If anything, I'd say drop more RAM in your pc.  If you're
really serious, drop in a new CPU too.  Other than that, I see that Ti500
lasting quite a while.
