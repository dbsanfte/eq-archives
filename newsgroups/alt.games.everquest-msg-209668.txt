As I understand it, it's on a sliding scale, with 33% being the maximum
you can lose in the case where the pet does the vast majority of the
damage.  I *think* it's a linear scale too, so if you do half and the
pet does half you only lose 17%, for example.

Also, I know if you have a dire charmed pet and you don't do any damage
yourself, only the pet does, you lose 75% of the xp.  That may apply
to regular charmed pets as well.
