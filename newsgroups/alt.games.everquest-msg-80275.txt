*Which* merchants?  There are several merchant factions in
Shadowhaven, perhaps you're trying to trade with the ones
which are *not* helped by "the faction quest" you happened
to do (there are several "faction quests" in Shadowhaven,
maybe you're not doing the right/best one for the merchants
you want to trade with).

...and you *did* mean Shadowhaven, didn't you?  The other
Luclin cities have other faction issues.
