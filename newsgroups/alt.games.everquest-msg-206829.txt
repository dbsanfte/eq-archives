So I zone in to Marus Seru this morning and go LFG.  There's a mage 
there also LFG.  Of course initially we ignore each other, we are both 
looking to be invited into real groups instead of forming a 
partnership.  Well I go kill a greyhopper and the mage runs screaming 
from the zone.  I didn't have very good technique, so I'm sitting back 
near the zone line medding up and swapping spells when he comes back in 
and goes LFG again.

I send him a tell "want to team up while we look for more?".  No thanks 
says the mage, and off he goes again.

I kill a greyhopper again, and he comes over and asks me for a breeze.  
I think about refusing, having been rebuffed by him, but heck, its cheap 
and I do enjoy being the better man.  So instead of holding up the "no 
buffs for joo" line that a member of the enchanter union probably 
should, I hook him up.  Then I pull another greyhopper while he does the 
same.  We end up with dead mobs at about the same time.. but he's 
sitting there with 20% of his  HP bar left and I have about 80% of 
mine.  NOW I get an invite.  Wait for him to heal up, then haste his pet 
and mine again, pull a stonegrabber (these things kick my butt pretty 
good, I have a 50% chance of killing one or having to zone).   Its dead 
in short order, with neither of us hurt, our pets down about 20% each, 
mana around the same.  Short med, repeat repeat. 


Then of course we get a pull with an add, and the wonder sort of runs 
out; now I'm stuck mezzing and rooting the add, can't get my pet on the 
original target, I'm not stunning the original target... takes a while, 
we kill both mobs, but this time at the cost of most of our mana and 
about 50% of each of our healths.

Guy cuts and runs after that, which I view as silly on his part, we 
didn't even die, and still ended that fight better than he was 
soloing... but it -was- clear that we needed to refine techniques in 
order to really deal with that sort of situation well.   How we're 
supposed to learn without trying is beyond me though. 

Plus after a bit I ended up forming a new group, again unconventional, 
with an SK, a mage, a wizard and a chanter (me).  After a while trying 
this for a bit, the SK logged out and brought in her mage instead, which 
went much better, with no PC's in deliberate contact with the enemy we 
could rely on mage healing for the pets (except mine) and generally we 
had a grand old time for quite a while

Then along came a druid/sk duo, which also worked pretty well... too 
well really.  They talked us into going after Reoth.  I warned them he 
was really out of the spell range of most of us but they claimed they 
had killed him before and heck, its only low level alts, always willing 
to try.  So off we go.  First off, mana regen is a serious problem out 
in the depths of the zone where they want to pull to, we keep aggroing 
zelinaks and lightcrawlers.  But they clear out all the recuso, we 
finally get caught up on mana, and they pull.  6 adds (zelinaks).  I get 
Reoth tashed, and SK runs off with him, while we deal with the adds.   I 
manage to get them all rounded up and under an umbrella of constant AE 
mez so we take them out one at a time.  SK brings Reothe back and we try 
him... nothing will stick.  Tash wears off I reapply.  Mages say they 
can't land Malaise at all.  Eventually my pet is dead and I charm a 
hunter that adds, at which point Reothe comes for me.  We try some more 
while I run laps, but then I finally get caught offbounds and die.

Do I have a point, no not really, just recounting the day.  Thought it 
was very funny though the mage turning me down, then asking for breeze, 
then watching me outsolo him and deciding to group after all, whereupon 
we did five times better and faster than either of us did soloing... 
just as I'd suspected.

Oh, and trust me about the Reothe thing.
