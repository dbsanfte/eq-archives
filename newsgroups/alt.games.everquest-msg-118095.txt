I'm a 26 Iksar Monk.  My current equipment is listed below but is mainly a
full set of Wu's (besides the collar, which I'm using Yelloweyes collar for
the str bonus), and two Polished Steel Ulaks.  It was fun for awhile there,
earning up enough money and getting each piece of Wu's at a time, but now
I'm wondering where to now?  What should I set my goal as now?  I'm earning
in general about 50-70pp every couple hours (but I'm moving zones so that
may go up) so I'm looking for items within that price range.  I think I'm
gonna be moving to HighKeep now, if that helps at all.  I've looked through
the items databases online and as a newbie I don't really know prices that
much and I've learned to not trust eqprices.com so any help would be greatly
appreciated.

Oh, and should I switch to 1hb weapons anytime soon?  My h2h skill is at 130
right now, but my blunt is crap, probably still feeble.  I think I'm gonna
start dumping my practice points there for the next few levels.
