As an enchanter I'd allow you to change sex and religion, which should
have been done. Perhaps an Illusion Orc spell, or an Illusion Mob,
like the Mage's Mob as a pet spell.

I'd like to see an expansion of the racial armors, allow weapon
crafting, or some other magical tradeskill addition.

I'd love to add a way for guilds to have multiple guildsays, so a
guild in a raid an use a different channel from the non-raiding
guildmates. I likes the megagroup suggestion a lot. I don't like the
mana regen speedup.
