After a particularly nasty corpse retrieval last night I got to wondering
what are the very worst places to die.  Those places that are so bad that it
practically requires a raid just to go in a get a body.  I've heard a lot of
talk about The Hole, and especially people who die going over the edge. I'm
guessing this is probably on the top ten list.  So how about it?  What are
the others?
