Probably not.  More likely, what's happening is you're just seeing the effects
of a limited posting base.   There just isn't enough people posting in this
newsgroup anymore that all classes are well represented.   (And they were
never equally represented.)

You hear a lot about Shadowknights mostly because that is what Lance is
playing right now.   He's often an extremely prolific poster, during the times
when he is in the newsgroup.    When he was playing his bard, mage or cleric,
they had the same excess of posts.

Not a complaint, Lance.   Just saying you post a lot. :)   I used to
contribute several things on the warrior and rogue classes fairly often, but
since I no longer play the game, I don't have much that is relevant to add.
Most of my knowledge that someone might have found useful is now several
expansions out of date.

If you do want an opinion on beastlords, I can give you a two year old one.
The combination of high dps and decent slow was great, almost to the point of
being overpowered.
