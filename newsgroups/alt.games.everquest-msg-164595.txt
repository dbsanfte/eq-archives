Agreed.  I do a particular PoP quest a few times now and then to get over a 
hump ( like making that last 2 blues to 44 ).  It took me 30 minutes to get 
those 2 blues running this quest as a caster ( abliity to gate, invis, and 
lev - got a SoW from someone else ).

I really like this idea.  I would also like some quests to have random 
things in them to make them not the same thing over and over.
