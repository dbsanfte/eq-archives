DEX is VERY important to a bard.  Higher dex = fewer missed notes and
stopped songs.  I think the threshold value on this is 100.  I noticed a lot
fewer missed notes once I got my bard's dex over 100.

But don't overdo it.  When I first rolled up a bard, I pumped everything
into DEX and CHA.  Big mistake.  By the time he got to level 13, I was
having a hard time carrying all my armor and loot.

I rerolled, putting more into STR and some into DEX and CHA (I forget the
exact numbers).
