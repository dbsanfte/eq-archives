I have earned all the money I have spend on my fletching skill which is now
127, by making dam1 Range150 arrows and selling them for 2PP per stack. I
usually fill 4 backpacks and go to zones with more than 50 players in them,
Lake of ill omen is my favorite. But even though i have been advertising my
skill there is still no request for bows.
