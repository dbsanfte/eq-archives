It's a great idea, and I'm sure many people would enjoy doing it .. But ..

Level 1's would be dropping in one hit from nearly every NPC inside the
city. Even if you gathered dozens and dozens of 50+ characters, they'd still
have a fun time clearing the guild areas because of the trainers. Level
60(+), completely immune to magic, (I believe) and hit for 375's .. They're
that strong because they're not meant to be killed. ;)

I remember hearing about a raid on Neriak, which ended up getting mowed down
pretty fast as some of the higher-level guards joined the fray. (At the
zone, too .. Not good for morale. ;)
