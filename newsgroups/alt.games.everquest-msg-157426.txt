Perhaps they moved his AC to the cleric table, so its about as effective
as our "plate".... now all they have to do is move clerics to the paladin
table and they've fixed the game so it works as intended.

After that they should scrap the whole tables idea and have AC actually
mean what it says it does, instead of meaning something different for
different classes.
