Hmmm... my trader never has AFK set... becasue that is all she is, is
a trader... so no one I know will be sending her a tell.
but I continue to crash to desktop...   in the past as you say I have
crashed to server select and char select... but after the recent
patch, the crash is always to the desktop.

luck to us all
