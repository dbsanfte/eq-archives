While Crucial does indeed probably make the best RAM out there, when
you are talking about a machine of this 'age' and speed, the stats
aren't as important, if at all, as they would be on a P4 or AMD based
system.    About the only real thing that might be a possible issue is
to insure that they are all rated for the same speed.  If you are
going to upgrade all 3 slots at once, make sure that all 3 chips are
either PC100 or PC133 (PC133 will slow itself down if your machine is
only 100mhz FSB, a term you don't really need to concern yourself
with)  It would also be a good idea to make sure all 3 chips are from
the same manufacturer.  Just a safety issue, more than anything.

For that kind of money, you can buy a 1ghz E-Machine, with slightly
better peripherals.... barring that, you can try to place a standard
chip in there (just upgrade the wife's machine first, and stick one of
the spare 64 sticks in there... if it works, you know someone is full
of garbage)

When it comes down to it, investing $400 in a machine that is limited
in upgrade capability is a waste.  You are better off either buying a
new machine, or having a savvy friend put one together for you.  You
can always use many of the parts you already have, and replace them
along the way.

The only real issue here is if the graphics are 'imbeded' in the
motherboard, or are they provided by a seperate card.  If it is the
second case, removing and replacing them is no real issue.  If they
are AGP cards, they will always be the top card in a tower case, or,
on a desktop, the card closest to the power supply.  A decent,
inexpensive upgrade would be the gForce 2mx 400 cards... they run
about $75 retail, with a lot of cheaper online solutions, and should
be a viable card for at least the next 2 years.

If the graphics are imbedded in the motherboard (you plug your monitor
into a port directly connected to the motherboard) you have a
completely different issue.   Your motherboard(s) may not have an AGP
port for a modern card to be placed in.  Also, if it does have this
port, you will need to know enough about computers and windows to shut
down any and all reference to the built in graphics.

Supported does not neccesarily mean capable, let alone good.  In this
case, more is better.

All WIN9x OS's have issues with properly handling memory over 256megs.
It just doesn't handle it like it should.  It should not cause any
system to 'blow up' though.   I run the original v1 of 98, and have
320mb of ram, and it works as well as it can.  If you want, can give
details, but they aren't needed.  As long as the program using the
memory knows how to use it and later release it, there is no issue.

Could be a large number of issues.  The easiest fix to apply (and is a
good idea anyway) is to go to a site like 2wire or speedguide, and
download the cable modem tweaks for windows.  They are next to
impossible to screw up, and you will notice improvement in all aspects
of your net connection.

You did not list hard drive sizes, but it is always a good idea to
have as much free space as possible on the drive running the swap file
(usually your C drive), and to keep that drive de-fragged, having the
internet cache emptied, recycle bin empty.

You also did not list what programs were being loaded in the
background... obviously, less is better.  

Lastly, an option to consider would be to change from a plain jane hub
box to either a DSL/Cable router, or a good quality switching hub.
Both options will run about $100, but can often make a big difference
in performance.   It will help you by putting equal priority on both
machines, instead of the FIFO (first in, first out) you are dealing
with now.  And with the DSL/Cable router, you also get a built in
firewall, as well as some other system security, removing the need to
run these on each computer.
