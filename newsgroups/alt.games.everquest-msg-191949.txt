For refference heres the relevant text from the patch message.

** Mitigation Change **

We have evaluated the mitigation abilities of cloth and leather classes, and
have
made changes as appropriate.  For the most part, this change is a reasonable
improvement to the ability of monks to absorb damage.  At some point in the
future we
may re-examine the mitigation abilities of chain and plate classes.  At this
time,
and with this final round of changes to cloth and leather classes, we
believe that
something very close to the appropriate balance is in place.

Now I never knew that there were problems with mitigation, and leather
classes. As far as my druid is concerned its no concern. If shes gotten
close enough to be hit by the mob then she's not doing her job right ;)

My beastlord is an all together different kettle of fish. I enjoy getting up
close and personal with my pet and wailing on a mob. A most optimistic
reading of the above quote would indicate that leather classes will see a
modest boost in thier mitigation abilities. This being SOE though I thought
I would poll the NG for opinions, or better yet, any first hand experiences
on how thier Beastlords have faired since the patch. Obviously I can form my
own opinions by simply going out and hunting with my Beastlord, but Id
really much rather go out with some idea as to what I should expect.

Any input is appreciated!!
