Is there a Valid reason to work tword Giant Faction the Dwarf faction! To me
it seems that the armor and the Bow there are better then anyhting the
dwarves offer! Also How many dwarvrs does it take to raise a faction point
with the giants and are there any giants that are KOS no matter how many
dwarves you kill?

thanks
