Try this quest.  I'm not sure if it's the only one that uses Orc Heads though.

You say, 'Hail, Sarialiyn Tranquilsong'

Sarialiyn Tranquilsong says 'Pleased to meet you Lulyeni. I am Sarialiyn
Tranquilsong, Virtuoso of the Songweavers Kelethin division. I have spent all
of my years here in Kelethin training our new recruits to ensure that all are
ready to defend themselves once their adventures take them away from the
Faydark and beyond. If you are a [young bard of Kelethin] then I might have
some exercises for you to complete.'

You say, 'I am a young bard of Kelethin.'

Sarialiyn Tranquilsong says 'Well then you surely must be interested in some of
the [training exercises] I have created for all young members of the
Songweavers bard guild.'

You say, 'What training exercises?'

Sarialiyn Tranquilsong says 'The training exercises that I speak of are very
important in the development of a young bards core abilities. You will have to
rely on all of your skills including hunting and gathering to complete these
tests but in the end you will be rewarded with a full set of your own armor
that you will craft by your own hand. Are you ready to [begin the exercises]?'


You say, 'I am ready to begin the exercises.'

Sarialiyn Tranquilsong says 'Fantastic Lulyeni, here is your Melodic Assembly
Kit. In this kit you will collect various items from all over the Faydark, Clan
Crushbone and in our hometown of Kelethin. You will then combine these items in
certain quantities inside your Assembly Kit to create armor
materials, which are then placed in a forge with the applicable mold to yield
your armor piece. As I provided you with your assembly kit, I can also provide
you with the armor molds for Tranquilsong [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards],
[Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates]. All you must do is simply
tell me what armor piece you [want] to craft, and I shall give you the
appropriate mold and material recipe.'

You say, 'I want to craft gauntlets.'

Sarialiyn Tranquilsong says 'To create your gauntlet material you will need to
combine 3 Bricks of Crude Bronze, 1 Spider Legs, 1 Orc Sternum, 1 Orc Head and
1 Orc Humerus in your assembly kit. Once you have created the proper material
take it to a forge along with this mold to fashion your very own Gauntlets of
the Tranquilsong.'
Reward(s):
Tranquilsong Platemail Gauntlets
