Nothing at all.  It was an off-topic troll post, and generally not worth
replying to.  (That's what the original poster was hoping for, actually.  If
you reply to the content of his off-topic messages, or even complain that it
doesn't belong on your newsgroup, then he's successful in creating the
disruption he intended.)

Incidentally, you also crossposted this message to alt.toys.transformers, even
though the "SeptemBORE 11th" thread has been dead over there for weeks, now. 
In the future, if you absolutely feel the need to respond to an off-topic
crossposted message, please send it only to the newsgroup that you're currently
reading.

By the way, please don't take this personally.  I normally don't call attention
to stuff like this, but this particular thread affected a *lot* of newsgroups,
and I'd like to cut down on the bandwidth clutter as much as possible.  If only
one person reads this and decides to follow my suggestion, then I haven't
wasted my time.  :)
