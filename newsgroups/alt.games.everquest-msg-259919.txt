Several possibilities.

One: the trader is nearly LD, or extremely laggy; he's there but pretty 
much not there.

Two: the trader logged/went LD while you were looking for him (not 
certain this one works, but its a thought)

Three: the trader is standing under/behind/inside another trader who is 
in pretty much the same spot.  This happens because you can log out and 
log back in, and someone else may have set up trader in the same spot 
while you weren't there.

Four: the trader is standing up on top of the canvas roofing in the 
selling areas.  I have heard this can happen in ways similar to three, 
I've heard that there's a way to deliberately do it to someone by first 
levitating them (can cast that from outside group) and then logging in 
and out "under" them.  But I know its possible to get up there on 
purpose, and I bet a lot of people do just that.

There's one particular trader I buy from regularly who's always in 
almost the exact same spot every time, and is always up on top of the 
canvas; I doubt its a coincedence.

Five: same idea, but "under the world".  Never seen this in Bazaar zone, 
but I've been caught under the world many times in other zones, and I 
figure its possible in bazaar too.

Six: trader is invis.  This one is perhaps least likely, because invis 
wears off for everyone but bards, and can't be cast on people you aren't 
grouped with... but

Six a: trader is hiding.  Hide doesn't wear off, perhaps he's turned 
hide on either to mess with you or because its part of a skill up hotkey 
and he doesn't even realize he's left himself hidden

There may be other possibilities I'm not thinking of.
