I prefaced this as being a rant, so please treat it as such. I have played a
druid, and do know what their role in a group is. He was the primary healer,
and as such, the person to do the healing. I was low on health because, I
was the tank in this situation. I wanted the mob on me so that the rogue
could backstab. The rogue had full health, so the pull wasnt bad, I just
needed a heal. By your own admission, you know nothing of bards or druids,
so your "rational" really has no base. And as for the language, please see
the above reference to this being a rant.
