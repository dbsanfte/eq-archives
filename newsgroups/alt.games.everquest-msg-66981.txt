Is it correct that certain non-evil race/class combinations are
non-KOS at the Overthere Outpost, such as agnostic or evil-worshipping
humans, erudites and gnomes?  So is it also true that an agnostic high
elf mage or wizard or an agnostic dwarf warrior would still be KoS
because, even though they're agnostic, their race can't play an evil
class like an SK/necro? (I thought I read that somewhere)

Also, a dumb question about the notorious Goons--if you're a good race
that's not KoS at the outpost, will they also leave you alone or will
they still waste you for not being an evil race?

Thanks in advance,
