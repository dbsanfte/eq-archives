   I don't think so.  I just said there was a beta, that is all. 
I didn't say anything about any of the particulars of what is
being tested.  In fact, I didn't say if I was a tester or not. 
Everyone who was offered the position knows about it (if they
have checked their email), and this knowledge came without
agreeing to a a NDA.
