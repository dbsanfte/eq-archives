Doesnt stop at PC...generally...

Crushbone to 14ish
PC to 24
HHK to 30ish
DSP / OT to 40ish
DL to 46
POJ exit to 55ish

Wouldnt say any of those places take much skill to fight in, so the 55's
without a clue is a pretty damn common sight.

Myself I have fought in all but 2 of those places (HHK and DL), but not with
my main, who has fought in many different zones to get to where he is.  Have
always prefered dungeon enviroments (unrest, karnors, seb, howling stones
etc).
