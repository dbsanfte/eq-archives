Yeah, I saw a couple rats.  The first one stayed near a couple of cats/dogs
and I tried to kill it, but a puma (red) decided to kill me.  Second rat I
saw (perhaps the same one) was walking towards a cat that was standing
still.  Not knowing which way it'd start moving again, I decided to abandon
the idea of killing the rat and ran off to see if I could find anything else
white.

Steamfont (on Test, anyway) does not have an area for level 1s...their
newbie area is a true death trap.
