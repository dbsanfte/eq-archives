On Vazaelle I found it so satisfying to scribe the spell recently and turned
up at Nexus. What I saw was a war of sorts as all the new 60s are casting
and expecting instant horses and phat loot. Not that I would mind those
things and that is what the game is about. I loaded up the druid for a
longer peek at what was going on. I noticed that some casters cast free till
a competitor left. I noticed that one had made a lvl 1 toon to harass (in
ooc) another caster. I learned from several KEI casters that they get
preverse spams. I can attest to a couple during my brief castings. I got
multiparagraphs of begging. I go invitation into the "KEI Guild" run by a
lvl 1 SK who wanted to see that KEI would be cast properly. (I assume my
Guild duty casting would be 3:58 am to 4:00 am Sunday mornings). I noticed
If I set a price I was called greedy in tells. I tried "for donations" and
"donations welcome". In both cases about 10 percent of those players getting
KEI poof away after the cast. I have also received donations of roots and
similiar items.  Oddly, I get much better donations from greens than from
dark blues. They are trying to minimize time in LOIO, OT and DL most likely.
I have also been asked to come to Fay (and other zones) for a buff from POK
("just take the book"). I have also been followed through several zones by
the nekked who died and "deserve a refresh caused by dying from something
bad". Most astonishing was one who came back approximately every 15 minutes
over several hours for a new KEI (paying). I can't believe they were getting
exp. I do not know maybe soloing the Dragon Necropolis at 10 works with a
couple healing druids and DS?? In dicussions most chanters agreed with me
that the less time in Nexus the better. Many meet in Nexus only to group for
a port out. I cast and paid for my spells and at this point generally do not
repsond to "need KEI plz" oocs. In general the game is not about the pp but
the drops. I have in the last week done Sebilis a couple times (Tstaff (lost
roll) but no fungi). But I had so much more fun and got actual exp (aa) and
loot was not really not that much worse than rather boring casting. As new
chanters via POP hit the magic level congratulations and job well done but
now also welcome to a world of "I have been working all day trying for
grandmaster level but have no money so can I get a int/wis" buff? Sometimes
you almost fall out the chair at these tells and other times you reach for
the reset button.
