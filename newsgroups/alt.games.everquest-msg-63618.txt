  Yes, Luclin will include new textures for old zones to make them look
better.  It doesn't increase the polygon count or 3D modelling of those
zones, but the new textures are of a higher resolution and make some things
look a lot better.  There are screenshots at http://eq.castersrealm.com...
things like the ground, the walls of certain buildings, tree bark, ect. all
look a lot nicer and less "blurred".

  In addition, with Luclin you will have the option of using the new
character models for the player character races, so in the old world player
characters and NPC humans, barbarians, ogres, ect. will look better.  All
this is information I've gleaned from the website.  I haven't read anything
about a "second disk", but that stuff may very well come on a second disk.
