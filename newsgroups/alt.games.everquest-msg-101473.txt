I can see how the reference to crack upsets you. Although I don't have such
a bad experience as you, I do not like to call it crack at all. If someone
refers to it as crack, I will imitiate having a hole in my head. Not in a
bad way, but to emphasize the "a fresh breeze flows through your brains"
thingy. That is how I try to see the crack, and not as a lethal drug. But I
wish that people would stop trying to give everything "cool nicknames"
(Leafblower, clickystick etc) and just type properly. (Yes, the PLZ annoys
me too).

But sadly we live in a world where nicknames are the norm. I had a Nicholas
on the phone the other day, and he wanted Nick on his credit card. I told
him we could not do nicknames, and he claimed it was not. I am sorry, but he
was born Nicholas, anything different from that, is a nickname. Same with
clarity and breeze, they were called that, and and anything else is a
nickname.

My 2 ramblings.
