Once upon a time, I read a recommendation for this situation to go find
a group near your level and ask to become the "7th member".  Tell them
you're only trying to increase weapon skill and ask if you can practice
on the mobs that they pull.  Chances are, your damage will be so small
as to leave you in no danger of pulling aggro.  The possible downsides
are obvious enough - you don't get any xp or loot, it's clumsy if the
xp group uses any kind of crowd control other than off-tanking, and
you'd have to find a group willing to trust you not to KS them.

Full disclosure: I've never tried this myself.  When my beastlord
wanted to skill up 2hb long ago, I found the lowest blues I could and
heavily leaned on my DoT spells, pet and healing spells while I killed
them solo.  I'm not sure how much weaker the non-weapon damage might be
for a SK, or whether this is practical with Combine server gear.

Of course, really joining a group is far better.  Still, this might be
a way to get on the waiting list, if the popular camps somewhere are
full.
