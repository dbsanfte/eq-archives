You really need to get a bit clearer on what is and isn't supported in
dx9 by Nvidia. The only part of dx9 that Nvidia doesn't support
currently is the pixel shader 2.0 part. There's nothing stopping SOE
from using ps1.2, which Nvidia does support and is backwards compatable
with dx9, if they use pixel shaders at all, which until we see some of
the new features they plan to add is still totally unknown at this
point. In fact, from SOE's point of view, I think they'd be pretty crazy
to alienate a large portion of their user base still using borderline
cards at this point in time.

Besides, SOE has shown lately they are going to put the least amount of
work (money) they can get away with into their new expansions. Coding in
pixel shaders and other dx9 tricks, other than the bare minimum needed
to look a bit closer to modern 3d games is unlikely to happen just from
the cost aspect. With the last expansion shipping untested, untuned and
unfinished, what makes you think they'll spend a ton of time on new
textures and fancy graphics?
