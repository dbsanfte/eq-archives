I lost access but figured out why. It is my normal course of action to
cancel the subscription as soon as i purchase more time .When i first orderd
god im sure they used the last credit card i had on file which was out of
date. Played in god for a week before they figured out they I had not really
paid yet so they made me pay before I could go back :)
