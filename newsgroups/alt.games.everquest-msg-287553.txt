i'm glad you're enjoying it ... you must love the eye candy, i have a
2.8ghz (oc) amd (2gb ddr 500 ram) running an ATI x1900xt; got it
running 1920x1080 and it seems very smooth to me

my rig is about 2 years old, so i'm sure you have it running lightning
fast

again, glad you like it - get deep in and let me know

eq2 was the first time i was able to see player action affect the
world - at just lvl 20, i found a quest wherein once i was able to
clear a bridge of trolls, the dwarves came and took over and held that
position ... i *love* that, and in eq1 the only times players could do
anything "meaningful" it was when they were the max-level powergamers

to each his own
(not that i ever played it)
