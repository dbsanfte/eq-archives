I agree, but camping for xxx days !=3D difficult.
The encounter is trivial for Uber guilds and (by all accounts) not hard
for much smaller guilds.
Thus having a click stick is not a status symbol.

Why ? If it was trigger and the encounter was not changed the same
people could get the epic (i.e. thoses that could complete the
encounter) but they would not have to wait / camp for days to do it. Net
effect the same people get sticks with the same difficulty, just less
boredom.

Ok so you think that it is too easy to get the cleric epic at the moment
?
*Boggle*

Still I can't see any reason here not to make RF triggered or any real
analysis of what effect there would be if 30 new epics turned up on
every server tomorrow. (Other than the fact that current epic clerics
and some other ubers would whine a lot)


Still asking :
