I dont hear people shouting "looking for a paladin" either... no single
class is ultimately needed except the Rogue in certain cases (prolly some
other stuff i forgot atm).

As the druid description says "jack of all trades, but master of none". Now
you want to be master of a few things (which they already are) and jack of
everything else. Druids should be nerfed.
