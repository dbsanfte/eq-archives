I'd have to agree that he's just missing something here. My monk is only
27, and I find mend to be reasonably reliable and FD is a pure godsend.
Add to that the fact that I can crank out the DPS at a very satisfying
rate. Of course there are those that can do it better, but not enough
better for me to be a concern, consider that when the stuff hits the
fan, I've got a safety net in FD, they don't. /shrug
