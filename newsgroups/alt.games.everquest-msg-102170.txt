The best thing about them is they are deep water wave machines. They
can be used far from any shoreline.  They float on the surface with a
below waterline mouth connected to an enclosed space filled with air.
There is one opening for the air to move in or out and that turns a
turbine specially designed to turn the same direction on both in flow
and outflow of air. Each wave rushes in forcing air out and turning
the turbine, then recedes pulling air in also turning the turbine.
The only possible negative would be on loss of surface light to sea
algae but I believe the figure I read was a 10x10 sq kilometer patch
could power all of California.  We'll see I guess.
