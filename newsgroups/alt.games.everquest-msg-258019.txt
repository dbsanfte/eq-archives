Everyone happy!  I love it.

Yea, personally, I've never seen what can possibly be so hard about 
hitting /pet back off.  It's not like they aoe every 2 seconds or 
something.

Yea... actually, some of the nukes I tested that hit for ~100 points or 
less didn't have a knockback.  But the point is, why the heck are they 
pickin' on us enchanters for it?  They insist on offtanking everything, 
freakin' let us nuke in peace unless they'd rather we just VoQed, VQed, 
and went /afk until it's time to bid on loot.

I think I know the time you mean.  /attack off wasn't the problem there, 
the problem was that we'd overflowed into a second raid, and the tanks 
were only calling for assists in /rs... so everyone in the second raid had 
to guess.  Which led to true foolishness when I broke my own @#$%! mezz 
with the rogue I was boxing.  /em turns slightly red.

Naw, it's all good.  I always comb my posts with a somewhat paranoid eye, 
but usually end up saying what I wanted to say anyway. :)

So logically, if we both die, we should get really stupendous loot!

Hah.  I just hope they drop while Prism can claim dibs!  I want those 
myself. :) Of course, I'm on a brief hiatus at the moment, since I just 
moved to BFE.  Back soon though, I hope.
