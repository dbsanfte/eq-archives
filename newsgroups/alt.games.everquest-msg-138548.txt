The pet does back off, but the monster taks a swipe at him before he gets 
out of range, so he gets mad and attacks again.  /pet back off works best 
if you give the monster something else to swipe at (like, for example, 
you). :)

}The other question is...how can I GET items from him, if there is even a 
}way?

You can't.

}Then the other day I had someone tell me he's seen people's pet actually 
}loot corpses and return to their master to hand over the loot.  I'm a tad 
}dubious on this one (would be NICE though..."hey pet, go chase that monster 
}that runs all over the zone, and when you are done, loot his corpse and 
}bring the stuff to me so I don't have to follow you around").

What he saw was clearly a cleric pet (more commonly known as a "warrior").
:)  There's a couple ways he could have gotten that impression.  There's
various illusions that will make a player look like either a mage pet, a
wolf (shaman pet), or a skeleton.
