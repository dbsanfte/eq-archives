Selos is, in general, a silly thing, in most cases SOW or better yet SOE 
or Billy depending on circumstances, is better, heck, Run 3 or JBoots is 
usually better.

Not faster, just better; there when you need it, not eating singing 
slots (well at least early versions, which last 3 tics), not eating 
memmed song slots.

Selos is better when you want to move FAST; for a few mobs that run at 
SOW+ speed (Snow griffins come to mind), but mostly for travelling 
across outdoor zones, or whipping thru an indoor one and back out the 
other side.

More Selos speed is... pointless on any level but that of getting a 
ferari instead of a corvette; either is faster than you ever need for 
any real purpose, but the "ooooh" factor on the ferari is a little higher.

Selos speed increase AA is like that; I'd buy it for my bard, but only 
so he can win foot races against bards who don't have it; its never 
going to be an issue in any ordinary sense.

Now, to your objection; if you are following a bard in your group and 
he's a bit faster than you, he will indeed outrun you, and drop you out 
of song range, at which point you will slow markedly (when it wears 
off), and get left in the dust.

This happens all the time even when you don't have a bard that is 
slightly faster; hit a tree, lag a little, lots of things can make you 
fall behind.  If you're following a bard, the Pirate's Code applies; 
those that fall behind get left behind.

However, if the bard follows YOU, then when he falls behind due to one 
of those things, you lose selos, and since he still has it, he rapidly 
catches up to you, you get selos again, and the little train resumes 
full speed.  If there's been a real mess, well, he's not only faster 
than you, but has track, and while bard track is only slightly better 
than the mark one eyeball, it does allow him to track to a party member 
anywhere in the zone.   Unless you happen to be a ranger or druid, this 
makes him much much better at recovering from you losing him than you 
would have been.

Further, this is a bard's big chance to actually take a well earned 
rest; you lead, he goes on autofollow, and can for once chat, lean back 
and crack his knuckles, have a drink from something other than a 
straw... let the poor guy enjoy his little respite from playing a one 
man version of the five man electric jam.

Bard following you and being slightly faster than you will mean fewer 
instances of him getting left behind, and will mean he catches up with 
you faster when he does.  Big deal?  No.  But I can't think of a down side.
