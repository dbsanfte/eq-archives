When the enchanter hits 44, she'll be able to make much better use of color
stuns, which eliminate a lot of the problems you list.  You'll no longer
have to worry about mob dps at all, since it will be (virtually) 0, only the
occasional resist (which won't hurt so badly with you stunning as well) will
allow the mob to attack at all.  Also, her mana won't be much of a concern
using this method, as there's no need to slow or root or nuke.  The stuns
themselves take very little mana, I would usually end up with 75% or better
while solo and just having my animation kill a mob in Velk's, with a dps
class or three I used so little mana it was not funny.  In fact, with pacify
and the stun-lock method, it's insanely easy to kill stuff for the active
enchanter, it just takes a long time.  There's no sitting around using this
method, but who plays an enchanter if they just want to sit around?! :-)
Anyway, this method is viable right up to 60+ in Plane of Mischief (my
favorite zone), or Veksar entrance goblines, or Velk's spiders, or probably
any number of other spots.
