You learn from another player. However after learning a couple points
in several such as dwarf, gnome etc my barb shaman had halfling and
dark elf ONLY as new ones showing up at her trainer suddently at level
10. I thought that was odd but promptly put like 10 points in each.
They are still there now and I've had no other new languages show up
at the trainer. Bug?
