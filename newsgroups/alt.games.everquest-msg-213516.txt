right here, you see me discussing the wondrous "lave storm" spell, as
opposed to "lava storm" which wizards receive at 34....

lave storm is a hybrid spell; it is part lvl 12 enchanter "whirl till you
hurl" and part italian laundry

"lave" is italian for "wash" . . the spell washes the mobs in a
soap-poisoning which causes blindness (as in "a christmas story") and then
the mobs are wetted and thrown in the whirly-wash, which over-dries them for
some additional damage as a result of sunburn
