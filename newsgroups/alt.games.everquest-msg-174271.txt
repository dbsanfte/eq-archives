Well, it would be helpful to know the spread of things a bit more. You say
the average is 30, but is that well spread out, or are there bunches around
certian levels?

There really are very few raids that service a range of levels very well -
but there are some. ToFS, Mistmoore, and Unrest, for example, all have
perhaps a 20 level range to them or more in terms of raiding being
"worthwhile".

My two bit suggestion, knowing little about the true makeup of your guild,
would be a progressive thing. Start with something like the bottom of
Befallen with several people playing guardian. This should be a nice and
easy raid warmup for you. Then move up to perhaps Mistmoore or Kaesora.
Finally, do something that stretches your groups a bit (and will probably
exclude the bottom members). ToFS would be my suggestion, since you can
progess to the maximum level you can handle after starting pretty easy.
