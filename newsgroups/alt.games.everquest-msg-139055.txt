Monks would be fools to carry coins around, they weigh a ludicrous
amount compared to what they can buy.  However, gems can be
bought from vendors for very little more than they sell to vendors
for, and are quite light weight.  A sensible monk would get cha gear
to 106 cha, and buy up a couple stacks of varying denomination.
Most obvious would be peridot, but you could get jasper for small
change, and Sapphires or something less useful for large amounts.
At any rate, then donating a peridot for a port, or several for a high
percentage rez, would be a simple matter.  Peridot are probably  the
most used gem out there, and druids can either hold them to trade
for rez of their own, or sell em for 10pp fairly easily.
