Actually it's not just charmed pets... all pets tend to break mez from time
to time for me. And once they start the person who's pet is doing the
breaking has to log before they will stop.

I've seen it with Shaman Wolf pets (no spells to break with) enchanter
animations, my own included, Druid BooBoo bears, and Earth elementals (spell
is a no damage root, so should not break mez), in addition to the standard
'it casts spells it can break mez' problem with some pets.
Never seen the sledge hammer break mez, but I don't see hammers that often.
Charmies though were a different matter... some charmies never even paid
attention to mez. I was doing some charm soloing and /pet attacking to break
mezzes a couple of weeks ago.. insane.
