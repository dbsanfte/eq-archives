1) Have all three of your Stuns mem'd and a one-hander plus shield.
2) While meleeing, watch for a "starts to cast" message:
2a) Bash, if you get an interrupt message repeat (2), else
2b) cast a Stun and repeat (2)

Note that the proper order of preference for your stuns is:
1) Cease (fastest and cheapest),
2) Stun (just as fast as Cease, costs more mana), and
3) Desist (slower to cast)

Note that, as another poster said, you should avoid using Root to stop
a runner as that will get the mob casting again (if you have to Root
try to make sure Bash is up as you will have the usual refresh delay
after Root before you can cast a stun).

Learn to do this well, and also to recognize lag conditions that stop

it from working, and eventually caster mobs will become your bread and
butter for solo experience.  And your favorite targets when grouped as
well (in your 50s it can easily be the greatest value you bring to a
group, depending on where you are fighting).
