    I'm counting on this NG to tell us as soon as a new recipe for any
trade skill is implemented.  I'm personally tailoring, brewing, and
baking.  And while I am no where near being at a hundred in my skill
points, I'll be mixing various ingredients whenever I can to try make
some new things.  I have the tables printed of www.eqtraders.com and
I'll be making sure what ever I create is documented there.  If not,
I'm going to put a message here.  Hopefully everyone else who comes up
with something new will do the same.
