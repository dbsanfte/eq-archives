I for instance respect the ACLU quite a bit . They have some segments though
that rather loudly argue for racial quotas and hatecrime laws . This annoys
me since I am a firm believer in equal protection under the law which both
of the former violate. Lokari seems to think that the republican party has
changed from Lincons time. I think it is exactly the same even though it is
not MY party.
