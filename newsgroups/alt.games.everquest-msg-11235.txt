Actually, no.  A judg, during arraignment, can decide pretty much what he
wants to.  He can tell someone accused of a crime that he or she has a get
out of jail free card and can emlist in the armed forces.  The idea is that
if you do something while in the service, it's federal and out of state
hands.  Nice way to wash their hands of someone.  Now it's usually reserved
for repetative non-violent offenders..

It is not an option though.  One accused of a crime cannot say I wanna go in
the army intead of in jail.  3/4th's of a century ago a majority of those
accused of a crime don't even compare with those in detention at high
schools now.

The idea boot camp for young offenders is quite common, but the camps are
NOT part of the military.
