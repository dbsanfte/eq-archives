I love Eastern Wastes myself.  My ranger has been there since the 30s.  With
your tracking you can pick the mobs you want to fight.  Not just fear kiting
the animals, I also liked meleeing the orcs.  There's a small camp north of the
iceclad bridge but I'm betting you'd like the Ry'gorr Keep better.  And I also
did centaurions, miners and watchmen using the CC / EW zone line as my base
camp.
