I'm not sure it's a bug.  As far as I know, every instrument works
will all songs of that instrument type *except* for Drums of the Beast
and the two Selos songs.  The explanation I heard was that the boost
on run speed is so much that it goes past the hard limit for travel in
the game.  If they worked, I would run close to three times as fast as
standard running.  I'm not bitching, since I still run about 2.4 times
as fast as unsowed folks.
