    The RNG can screw people in other ways, too. Others have reported
killing and looting every mob in the dungeon and still not getting enough
items to win. Having seen what drop rates are like at times, I would not be
surprised to hear that sometimes not enough items are put in the dungeon for
a win to occur. My groups are silly overpowered - killing 60 mobs in 45
minutes with NEC, CLR, ENC, DRU, ROG, WIZ as the group - and we still avoid
any collection mission.
