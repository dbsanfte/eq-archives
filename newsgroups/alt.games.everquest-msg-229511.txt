Dont do this, please. We have enough people spamming zones, with
things like, "New trader open!" or "I need 5pp please!" or "Can I have
a weapon please" (that one I reply with a rusty)

Nobody really needs to do this outside a guild or group. We have guild
raffles all the time, for fun.

The player casino was a scam. I bascialy put all scammers on my list
marked , "don't pee on if they are on fire" list, which is worse than
ignore.

Sony's was a lame attempt to add a game for players, but in SH it was
wrong. Perhaps HH where they origially were going to go, just out of
the way, or use it to fill underused zones.
