If you plan on higher level dungeons and raids, then you certainly will be
taking hits, if im pulling Tormax guards, ToV mobs, <insert any flurry type
mob here> the only thing that really makes any difference is my hitpoints,
theres nothing worse then working with your pull team to single pull a real
tough mob, only to get wasted on the run back and have the mob return home

I think I put a ton of points into agi or dex when I started.. but i was a
n00b then and didn't ask anybody (I think i relied on that horribly
inacurate EQ strategy book)

If I ever re-made, i would max STA off before any other points were spent.
