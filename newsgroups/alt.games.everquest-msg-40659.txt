    My experiences are even more extreme than DT's. This is what I've
noticed: if in one group there's someone for whom the mob doesn't give XP,
and that person does ANY damage to the mob, you get the Trivial message if
there was a TCC drop. I haven't tested with a passive person, as we tend to
keep them outside the group for fear of a loot poof.

    This is what I would do to test the code: level 50 plus paladin grouped
with some level 15's. First test, pally pulls a rare and zones (should be no
poof). Second test, have another high level pull a rare and zone while the
pally sits in a faraway part of the dungeon. Third test, have the pally heal
the level 15's during the fight. Fourth test, pally gets in there and whacks
away with the rest of them.
