Hi, I think you're someone who simply states he is in New York therefore
it's his problem and noone elses. Everyone should bow to your tragedy, your
pain, your misfortune, as the rest of us have no clue.You are the expert.
You really don't care what happens to anyone else, just that everyone
recognizes you live in New York. If you had a clue you would know that
attack by water supply is laughable, stupid, improbable, and something that
would have to happen well downstream in the network to have any effect.

I am giving people tools to figure out for themselves where they are, what
their risks are, how to deal with their situations by their own means,
unlike our government. I am sorry you disagree and have to continue this
insult spree while beating your chest that you are in New York and your pain
is bigger than everyone elses, while the rest of us send Billions of dollars
to your State.
