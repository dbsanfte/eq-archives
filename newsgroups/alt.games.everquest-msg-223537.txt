An adequate bard can twist three songs.  A good bard...

I was in a group in Umbral Plains, helping a druid friend get armor.  Group
was 52 WAR 52 DRU 56 ROG 51 MNK 49 DRU.. and your humble correspondent, 55
BRD.  Druids had KEI thanks to an other toon of mine.  My twist was
DS/Haste/Snareslow, with mana/healsong for background music between pulls.
(Note: not using song names because this isn't written for bards.)

Then the monk brought in a three pull...

Target mob one, start mezz song, target mob two, equip horn, mezz song hits
mob one, stop/start mezzsong, target mob three, mezz hits two, stop mezz
start snare/slow, equip brass, target mob one, snare/slow hits mob three,
stop snare/slow, start haste, haste hits, start mezz song, ignore complaint
that manasong has dropped...

I consider myself between adequate and good.  A really good bard probably
would have charmed #1 and used it to offtank #2 or something; I didn't have
charm loaded (was using bind sight song to watch what puller was up to).  I
probably should have found a way to slow the target as well; my reasoning
was that with a tank-heavy group with two healers haste was more important
than slow.  (Keeping two mobs occupied and off the healers is more important
than anything).  The above paragraph is really pretty basic bardwork.  Minor
considerations - running forward to target the first mob, then running
backward staying in range to get the first mezz off early - were left out.

It's not the twisting that makes a great bard, and it's not the juggling of
instruments, and it's not weapons or equipment.  It's watching the situation
and responding to it with the songs you have ready, knowing what's going to
happen 3 seconds in advance and bending the situation to your advantage.

I'm not great.  But I'm learning.  :)
