Going back in to the tutorial, I finally managed to take down the 
slavemaster, and he dropped a brick of iron (not the actual name). 
Previous kobolds had dropped some kind of bonze, I thought for some kind 
of class newbie armor quest.  But this made me think, and I went back 
over conversations with the armor and weapons guys; the weapons guy said 
something about [bronze].  I'd missed it running rapidly thru the 
sequence to get the charm upgraded, since most of the stuff they said 
was just "how the game works" which I already knew.

Originally, you start with a 6/33 axe.  Weapon guy in the tutorial 
sharpens that to a 6/31 axe.  Giving him a bronze brick gives you a 7/32 
axe, giving him the iron brick gives you a 8/32 axe.  This is, as you 
can imagine, a powerful upgrade

The class/race quest in Hallas for a weapon requires drops from 
blackburrow, and in particular a giant snake rattle... so it may be a 
while yet before I can get that, whatever it is.

Yep, the level 8 book is some sort of snare ability, and the level 16 
one is a stun ability.  In between, at 10 and 15 IIRC, are more upgrades 
to the "make some throwing axes" ability.  Frankly, unless the upgrade 
is in Range, rather than in delay, this is pretty silly, I can't imagine 
I'm going to throw kite anything to death even if I can get that Snare 
thing working.  Its nice having plentiful pulling tools (400 in a single 
stack) but to me their damage is irrelevant, all they need to do is get 
the mob to come over to me.

Got level 6, got Frenzy.  Its a skill, and is on the same time as 
slam/kick.  However, instead of the 6 damage or so that Kick has been 
doing, I'm getting 20 points most of the time with a frenzy hit.  I'm 
not sure what thats based on, there's a graphic that makes it look like 
I'm swinging the axe... so its possible its based on my weapon damage, 
but getting 20 damage from an 8 damage weapon means the math would be a 
bit screwy.  What I should do is equip my old 6/31 axe and see if the 
frenzy damage drops.  I miss sometimes with frenzy (but less often than 
I do with kick by far), and sometimes have done 10 damage instead of 
20... but those are the only two numbers I've seen.

Completed the newbie quests, polar bears became more cooperative.  I 
have to say this was the easiest of all the newbie armor quests I've 
done, no rare drops or rare mobs involved, just straightforward "go kill 
all the kinds of mobs you see in the newbie zone" stuff.  The weapon 
requires you to go to Blackburrow, which is certainly harder, but none 
of the drops for it appear to be rare/rare either, I'm already halfway 
done, and one item (giant snake rattle) is one that's dropped 
plentifully in there for years, so the only item that might be hard to 
come by is the gnoll foot bones.

Killing the Slavemaster was a trip, I'd gone after him several times 
before and been wiped.  Early on I could get him single but really 
couldn't take him out.  Later, probably due to steadily worsening kobold 
faction, I was unable to get him without adds, which was too much.  Then 
I ended up fighting him but having a shaman who wasn't actually in the 
fight healing him.  Finally, I managed to clear all the mobs in his room 
without aggroing him, and went to town.  I was neck and neck, and could 
see that it was going to come down to luck, when my intimidate worked 
all of a sudden (in 5 levels it only worked once before that, and when 
it did it only got me in trouble as my target ran to adds), he ran and I 
chased, getting several hits in before it wore off.  Now I was ahead by 
10%, and chances were good I'd win even with a little variation... then 
intimidate worked a second time, and I killed him before it wore off, 
with 25% hp left.

If intimidate is at all reliable, having that combined with the snare 
skill I'm going to get at level 8 will be a potent combination, used 
with discretion.  Sadly, I've NEVER seen a skill increase despite 
mashing intimidate every time it comes up, I have only the 20 points I 
plunked into it at the trainer (I know, sounds crazy, but if it works 
its a heck of a plan)
