    TO ALLAKHAZAM'S!

    The one my shaman has is the Skull-Marked Shield, which she got for 3 K
in the Bazaar. This was a lucky purchase, though. AC 22 WIS 7 HP/MANA 50.
Drops in Umbral Plains. The Bone-Braced Buckler is slightly better, and much
more expensive (I see them go for 10 K plus): AC 25 STR/WIS 10 HP/MANA 55.
This drops in The Grey. If losing the WIS on the Shield of Falsehood isn't
an issue, go Sarnak Battle Shield (Chardok) - I've seen them down as low as
1 K these days. If the WIS/MANA is the primary function of the shield, I see
Crystal Chitin Shields (from Velk's) going for 3 K and Strathbone Shell
Shields (AC 19 WIS 8 PR 10 MANA 5) going for 2 K. Those are the common
alternatives you'll be looking at.
