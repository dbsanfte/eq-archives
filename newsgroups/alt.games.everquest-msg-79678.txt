I once did my best to pull the entire house in Unrest.  I ran in
the back entrance, went upstairs to the knight room, aggroed the
bar, ran out through the hand room onto the roof and then jumped
down and waited by the hedge maze.  Our guild was running an
event for lower levels and the higher levels needed some
entertainment.  I think the only thing I missed was the Ghost
room and basement and someone pulled him out a minute later.
