You picked three soloing classes, try playing a cleric or warrior or
rogue, which should do a better job of forcing you to group.  Get into
grouping, you make friends.  Make a list of these friends, and then form
-good- groups with them, instead of the randomness of pickup groups.  With
a good group of people who work well together, you can do dungeons at any
level in the game, from 1st to 65th.  So take your good group and go
somewhere level appropriate for them.  If you include a porter (druid or
wizard), this will be a little easier, but really with POK available
there's not many places that are all that out of the way.

There are no dungeon groups because people don't generally form groups in
dungeons, they form them elsewhere, then say "hey, we rock, lets go do
Befallen" (or Ssraa, or Sebelis, or what have you, depending on level and
preference).  ANd because outdoor groups tend to be safer, more forgiving
of mismatched groups or less than competant players, so they are steadier
ways of leveling up.  To take a risk, someone has to take the initiative.
Since you weren't running typically hotly sought out classes, nobody
forming such a group is likely to give you a tell; while all three classes
can do well in a group, they aren't anyone's "got to have one" picks.  SO
the trick is, form the group yourself.  Look around at all the people LFG,
and start inviting them, you'll be surprised how many say yes; people are
sheep.  Ask Teapray.

One other topic you bring up, though.  You'll "never get invited to raids
since you don't have any dungeon experience."  Ah, thats not so; there's
no way for people to tell what sort of experience you have.  "Outdoor all
his life" isn't anywhere on a /who all Tyaan search.  You may perform
poorly, you might never get invited back... but because you did poorly,
not because you were never in a dungeon.  Heck, more than half the
population in the game have deliberately avoided dungeon environments up
into their 50s, eliminate all of them and raids dont have a very large
force to draw on.  But the way to get in raids is to be in high level
guild.  Sadly, this almost certainly means leaving whatever guild you were
in in your 30s, since most 50+ guilds don't take in level 30s, and guilds
of people in their 30s tend not to advance much past that level, as people
keep leaving for real guilds.  Think of that level 30 guild as
Kindergarden; its training for guildmates, for picking a guild, for the
officers in dealing with guild issues... but you are going to be leaving
it, unless its a great fit, full of people who advance just as fast as you
do, and who's tastes turn to raiding just when yours do.

Further more, there's nothing really all that different about dungeon
environments; you still pull mobs, crowd control them, and kill them.
Doing so is usually more tricky, and often more rewarding, but skills from
outdoors still mostly apply.  And with POP, almost every zone is outdoors.

That said, just released is a new expansion, Lost Dungeons of Norrath,
which is 100% dungeons, requires groups of at least 4, and should be
fairly easy (compared to dungeons in the world at large) to find groups
in, at least while its a novelty.  SO if you can afford to plunk down $25
or so hard earned cash for the priveledge, you've come complaining about
this at just the right time.
