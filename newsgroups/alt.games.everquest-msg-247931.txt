If you want to see the original loading screen, open up the EQ Tutorial
file.  It should load up with a loading screen with the original.  If
you want to see the original log in screen, you may be able to find a
screenshot of one hanging around somewhere on the Internet.  Best place
to start is the EQ website itself.
