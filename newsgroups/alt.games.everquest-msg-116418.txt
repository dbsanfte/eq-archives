I agree completely.

On the subject of ports, I run four characters (just for my own amusement,
which is why none of them are levelling too quickly).  My main is a dark elf
rogue, the others are a human monk, a half-elf ranger, and a wood elf druid.
The rogue is (still) at level 10, the others are all lower.  They're all
currently in Qeynos Hills, and only the ranger started anywhere near there,
in Surefall.  (I wanted them there because a couple of my friends started in
Qeynos.)

The point is that while I've never found ports all that difficult to
obtain - it's usually just a case of selecting a port-capable player off the
/who list, asking nicely, and freely offering donations of whatever little
money you can spare - there is a lot to be said for travelling on foot.  The
only reason I would ask for a port in the first place is that I want to be
certain to get to where I'm going alive.  When I'm forced to walk, I look on
it as being no bad thing aside from the risk.  My druid started in Kelethin,
asked for port to Qeynos but no-one could help, so I walked it.  I'm not
familiar with Faydwer so I was fully expecting my level 4 druid to be hacked
to pieces before ever seeing Antonica, but it didn't happen.  And I had an
interesting run through Butcherblock, saw some of the sights, took a wrong
turn and explored Kaladim quite thoroughly, then with a bit of help from
passers-by found my way to the harbour.  It was only in East Commons that I
found someone willing to 'beam me up' (thanks, Towlie) and take me west.

Ports are nice if you can get them - but as Welsh says, you do miss out on
the sheer workmanship that's gone into creating such an enormous gameworld.
