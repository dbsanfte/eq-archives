Sorry, no.

This was back when people were saying "Public NToV raids?
Bwahahahaahahaa...  maybe we should corner the coffin market now."

And as a guild we have never done anything beyond HoT farming.   The monks
still already had better than thier ToV armor well before they set foot into
the zone.

I'll go ask.  We have a 60 monk who doesn't do the public thing.  One of
those that turned up her nose at the HoT armor.  I'll find out what her
armor class is and come back.

Actually, no.  I quit the game for a while during those times.  When I
started playing again, Velious was out and had been for a while.

Have you ever seen a warrior do anything effective while naked?   Only
classes I have are the casters.
