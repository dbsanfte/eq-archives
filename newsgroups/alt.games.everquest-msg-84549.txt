OKay, started up a gnome necromancer.  Yow, when they said high difficulty for
the class/deity combo, they weren't kidding.  I can barely purchase anything in
Ak'Anon except at my guild and for very few merchants.  Took a trip to Kaladim
and did nothing except walk by a guard on the road and *BAM* dead.  Seems I am
kill on sight there.  Have not gone to any other cities since I have spent most
of my time running back from Ak'Anon to retrieve my corpse.  Which leads me to
my first questions.  I recently read a comment here in the newsgroup about
necros being able to summon their corpse via a coffin.  If this is true, where
can such a coffin be purchased and how much does one usually run?  I did see one
for sale at my guild, but it was a Jade inlaid one and cost ~550 plat.  Also,
are they one use only, or do you get multiple uses?
My second question is regarding faction standing.  Since I am KOS on in Kaladim,
is it possible to raise my standing with them so that I can at the very least
get close enough to the city to bind and not get killed?  Purchasing is not too
much of a problem, since I can have one of my other characters buy what's needed
and pass it on.  Just want to be able to get in to get bound so I don't have to
run back from halfway across the continent.  If I can raise faction enough, what
and how many do I need to kill to do so?  I'm thinking either goblins or krag
chicks, but each raises a different faction and I am not sure which the guards
belond to.  Anyway, any information will be helpful.  This seems to be a
challenging but fun class and I'd hate to have to abandon it.
