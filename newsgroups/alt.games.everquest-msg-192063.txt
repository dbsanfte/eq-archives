 We didn't notice any of this but my lag was pretty bad all night.
Moreso than usual.

 If they gave Monks 100% mem blur as an ability or something I'd find it
useful in certain places. Otherwise I rely on mobs still remembering me
to help makes splits easier. What I find lame is that it was on test for
weeks and then when it slips onto Live servers Alan seemed surprised.

 I agree. I don't think it's the Ranger thing. I think aggro in general
is screwed up. Few times I wouldn't even be doing anything, waiting for
tank to get some aggro, and the mob would turn and start whacking me.

 We tried once on MM and didn't do so well. I heard Fenin was hitting
people all the way across the room no matter where they were. Or
something like that.

 There was a patch shortly after servers came up. Always check his site
for fixes.

>5) (To match yours) Nothing in the elementals enraged either.  It was great!

 Enrage is lame anyway. But yeah, I wasn't noticing rage on anything.
