Nice to see someone really post usefull replies. /sarcasm off

As the poster said, theres lots of euro players in the guild. My guild 
got same problem, were 85% euro players. This means that maybe 20 people 
got it, either by being in a country where its actually released yet, or 
by paying extra 20$ to UPS for fast shipping. Personaly im buying from 
DVDBoxOffice. Free shipping, but will take 1-3 weeks delivery time, but 
i will STILL get the game before its released in europe. Release date 
here are 21/11.

This means that the raid feature is quite useless so far, since only 
maybe 4 or 5 on a raid will have POP at the moment.
