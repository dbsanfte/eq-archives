I have no doubt I'll buy this expansion, but right now I can't say that it
interests me in the least. I guess I'll have to see what the Tribute system
is.  As I complete my last AA to get run3 and trudge onward with the goal of
getting SCF3, which seems light years away, the last thing in the world I
want to hear about are more AA's.  The Lore is a real snoozer and the
screenshots and mobs generally look like more of the same.  Is this supposed
to be the expansion that introduces the new graphics system that's supposed
to look better but consume fewer resources? That could make it worth it.
YMMV.
