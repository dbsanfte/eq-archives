Bah - ya know you want to do it!

I use a Toshiba Tecra 8100 when I'm away from home.  3d is adequate,
but not great.  My biggest challenge with the laptop play is having to
step down to a modem.  Since I play a bard, typically from cable
modem, this can dramatically affect my game play.  So... when on the
laptop I tend to work on my skills - fishing, woodwind, brass or just
plain old chatting with folks while mana song is going.
