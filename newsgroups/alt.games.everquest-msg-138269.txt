Echo Caverns, Needlite cave. Here's how:

Gather Shadows and jump into the cave. Avoid the life-sucker thing on the
ceiling.

There will be one needlite at the cave entrance. Set up camp along the wall a
little bit away from him. He won't aggro until you get close.

Get your pet - the 20 pet is fine for this.

Buff yourself with Shielding, Spirit Armor, Shieldskin/Leatherskin, Grim Aura
and Banshee Aura. Equip your favorite weapon.

Fire up Allure, med up, then Focus and Spirit Armor your pet.

Target the entrance needlite and pull with Darkness. Send pet, then wade in and
start tanking. The bug has a very low delay so he hits often. He'll chew himself
up on your Banshee Aura and you won't take any damage until Leatherskin is used
up.

Back off when Leatherskin is consumed, then tap the bug. He'll turn to run but
your Darkness will keep him from running. 

Med up, rebuff, heal & refocus your pet if necessary, then pull the next one.
They're all single-pulls except the pair at the back corner. You can ST split
those when you hit 24 and get that spell; otherwise just leave them alone.

The Queen sometimes spawns in the middle of the cave, sometimes next to a
regular needlite, and she'll need to be ST split also. At level 23 you'll have
trouble with that pair so target the needlite, send your pet, hit the needlite
with Heat Blood and Leech, then FD and hope the pet kills him before dying. Make
sure you click off Allure while you're down.

If you wait about two minutes between kills you will have the room popping
more-or-less nonstop. The loot sells for a couple of plat each and is stackable,
and you'll max your Defense in no time. It starts to slow down at 29 but I've
heard of people who have stayed until 34.
