Bored, and annoyed a few times tonight as I
ran around killing blues and medding, I 
jotted down this list.  Nothing particularly
deep here, just having a little fun.

My Top Ten "Don'ts" of Everquest

10) Shout "Ding, level x"  Does EVERYONE in
the zone really care?

9) Make fun of other people's equipment.  
Especially if you are a twink.

8) Use the abbreviations "plz" or "thx".  Looks
stupid.

7) Spam a zone.  We don't need to know every
five seconds that you are selling bone chips or
looking for a group.

6) Killsteal.  Even if you think you can get
away with it.

5) Constantly ask in open channels where various
landmarks are.  Either explore, or research a
zone by going to eqatlas.com.

4) Piss of a cleric.  Ever.  And, to a lesser
degree, druids (ports, heals, and SoW), wizards
(ports), shaman (SoW, heals, tons of buffs), 
enchanters (breeze and clarity), rangers (SoW
after 30), bards and necros (lost corpse recovery).
Might be easier to just not run around pissing
other players off if you can avoid it.

3) Inspect others without asking first.  You 
might not mind if others inspect you, but there
are several people who do.  Considered to be
extremely rude in many circles.

2) Pick a name that labels you as an idiot, 
such as "Poopfinger", "Cheezychik", "Gandalph"
or "Elvispresley" (all seen on Drinal server).

1) Beg.  Ever.  This includes asking for or 
demanding heals or buffs, as well as requests
for money or items.  Also asking to be Power
leveled, or expecting higher levels to act like
they are obligated to perform af if they are 
newbie guards for you.

Annie <--- Perhaps should add "Whine that
           you don't live in a perfect world"
           to the list as well.
