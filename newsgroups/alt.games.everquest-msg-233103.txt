Since level one, Divine Aura has not left my spellbar, EVER. This can come 
in VERY handy. Say the puller brings adds, or a train happens. The MT is 
dropping fast- my CHeal hits when he is very low. All the adds decide they 
want Cleric for dinner.

By using Divine Aura, I become invulnerable for a max of 18 seconds for 
little mana and a fast cast. During that 18 seconds, the mobs leave me 
alone, going back to the tank or whoever. This gives the tank a bit of time 
to regain aggro.

If I need to heal before then, I click off the DA icon.

I judge that I use it once ever 3-4 sessions, but I have never felt that it 
was a waste of a spell slot.

Also, heal over time is your friend. I use my cele's in a lot of 
situations- healing a shammy after an unloved slow landed on the mob, for 
example. These have an excellent mana/hp ratio, and produce a lot less 
aggro than their one-blast equivalents. By all means, slap down a fast cast 
for a chanter or something, but secondary melees can usually be cele'd. 
This spell is also useful when you need to cast cheal but it will not land 
in time- slap a cele down then start the cheal- the cele can buy you some 
time to get that complete heal off.

Your first major investment should be a mount. I prefer drogmors, as their 
head is not in my face. To get off in a hurry (say, to interrupt a spell) 
use /dism. The mount means you don't have to sit to med, which means that 
you med through the one or two ticks your cheal spans, and you med after- 
never having to worry about sit aggro.

Your next investments should be focus effects. In my opinion the most 
important is a mana efficiency focus effect, followed by extended 
enhancement, then casting haste. Spending less mana on a spell is the same 
as regenerating more mana per tick.

After these are accomplished, increase your mana pool with +WIS and +MANA 
items.

Flowing thought items are nice- get them if you can.

Hope that helps!
