I dont ask for "nebulous good of the game".I ask for fixing almost
game stopping bugs like frequent client crashes,unusable
maps,corrupted
ini-files,being brought back to server selection when switching char
and the dreaded "you have already a char logged in message" for 10
minutes,etc.etc.etc.

How many customers do you think they loose by this?
