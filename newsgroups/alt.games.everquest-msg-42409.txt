I never really thought of this, but this is about the best point I've
seen on the subject. After reading this I went to allakhazam's and
here are some examples I saw right away:

Foraging hammer stat graphic: 

13.6 k 

the text for this item is:

"Damage: 4
Delay: 38 
Ratio: 9.5 Laughable 
 
Weight: 6.5 
Weapon Skill: One Hand Blunt" 

basically the graphic of this item tells you nothing more than that,
and it is a very ordinary crappy item. No one is going to be inspired
by a graphic of a foraging hammer or really want to go and get one at
all due to the stats. Having the stat graphic of this item is
therefore really a waste. It is not a fantastic, nor even a good, item
that someone will find hard to believe due to the stats unless you
have a graphic for it. Once again, 13,600 bytes. 

Okay, now we have a connection:

Who drops said foraging hammer? Why a dwarven smith which has a
picture over at Illia's in the beastiary (a part of allakhazams, with
same premium membership) How many bytes is this totally mundane
picture of a dwarven smith of crushbone which you really NEVER need to
have a picture of (its a dwarf.. duh....)

37,356 whopping ass bytes.

even if they feel they HAVE to keep such screenshots of such mundane
crappy mobs and items, I reduced the jpg quality to only 75 percent on
that particular picture and  made it:

6,837 bytes

while it basically looks the same. That is a fraction of its former
bandwith AND storage.

Worse, there are stat graphics for such horribly mundane items as a
rusty mace:

39,618 bloated ass bytes

even if someone clicks on a rusty mace to see the stats, they
certainly would not be doubting the validity and need the stat
graphic.

This is more than enough:

"Rusty Mace   
 
Damage: 5
Delay: 38 
Ratio: 7.6 Awful"

Agreed. Really even quests don't need to be weeded out, text is very
small. Reading what you said and going there myself, I feel that
really removing most stat graphics for all but really uber items (such
as velious quest armors, planes armors, various uber weapons) would
cut his bandwith by more than 2/3 which would likely eliminate the
problem.
