You are agreeing with me; 800 pp isn't much for anyone hunting in CS.

The same thing happens to me with requests to go res someone in
some other zone.  It just eats my play time, so unless I'm in the
mood for it... and oddly I sometimes am... no, I'm not interested
in getting ported halfway around the globe, then running pell mell
off to another zone in order to drop 700 mana on someone.  No
amount of money I've ever been offered would make me change
my mind one way or the other.

As I say, drag it to me and be patient, and its free.  Can't get much
cheaper than that.  If I have to leave my spot and travel, likely
as not to another zone... well, its the same situation as you porting.
Lots of not-hunting time spent.  Probably more than you spend porting,
in fact, since I often have to go somewhere other than just to the port
location, in some cases going right thru harms way to get there.
The relative burden of the specific case is -exactly- the issue they
should be looking at.

If I were a druid, I'd never port anyone anywhere that wouldn't
come to me and wait for me to get around to them.  Just as with
the res, its me doing them a favor, after all.  Least with Res,
the people that say "I'm in Firiona Vie" have an excuse, but your
"customers" are by necessity in your zone.

I don't see your Half the mana point though.  Given that I
don't know the mana cost of a port versus a res, I've still
seen enough groupmates do a series of ports in a row
that leads me to believe its at worst comperable (700 mana)
I assume you are saying you have to port out and then
back...but thats not the case if you are bound in your
target zone, then its a mere 50 mana to come back.  Further,
I often res two, three, or four in a row.  If you port a group
of up to five people, your mana cost is the same as if you
only took one.

Yep, ressing someone that drags the body to me is like a TL
must be, a little easier, even, since I don't have to juggle a
slot open in a full group

The only times I've recieved anything cool for a res, its been a
complete surprise, never as a result of someone holding it out
as a bribe.  Its also excedingly rare, in fact I can't recall the last
time it happened, I'm sure not since I hit 49.
