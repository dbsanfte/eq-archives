It makes a huge difference. You also should have texture cache on
and make sure using umbral is not disabled. Some people disabled
umbral eons ago when luclin first came out, there are no problems with
it now. Umbral makes it so anything you can't see is not rendered, it
works hand in hand with the clip plane.

You should have the clip plane at about 5 percent since there is that
bug where its out farther at zero when you log in or something (or was
it zone?) 

I'd not bother reducing names to first, turn off all player AND npc
names while there. I notice the difference in turning off names there
INSTANTLY.

Biggest difference? switch that line at the end of defaults in
EQclient.ini to true, the one that says turn off all luclin player
models (this way you don't have to change your normal setting. 
Even vah shir don't have a luclin model now. This was the largest
difference for me. I can now RUN around the bazaar and am using a
geforce MX 400 64 meg with a p2 400 processor and 576 meg of ram.
I did not even disable velious textures on the old model, I get such a
good rate with them anyway.

Even with the good performance gain, when I go into vendor mode I then
look at the floor in first person view, so I'm lagged even less
graphically.
