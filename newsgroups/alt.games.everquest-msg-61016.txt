I will just share my own personal experience with you...  I started EQ just
over a month and half ago.  My first character was a Wood Elf Ranger.  I
played her to 5th level and died outside Crushbone.  (LOL Don't ask...  I
got a bit turned around while I was investigating...)  She had NO business
being that close to Crushbone at 5th level.  Anyway, couldn't find anyone to
help me with a Corpse Run so...  I debated a few minutes.  After a few
minutes I realized that in my opinion the Wood Elf city is the WORST place I
can imagine being, I deleted that lvl 5 Ranger and made a new Ranger.  This
time I made her a Half Elf and started her in Surefall/Qeynos.  She is now
lvl 22 almost 23 and I love her.  Qeynos is, again in my opinion, the
greatest place to start a character.  The newbie zone is great, Qeynos Hills
is great, you are close to Blackburrow where the Gnolls live and also close
to West Karana and Everfrost.

I have taken my character back to GFay for sh*ts and grins once...  And I
hate that city just as much with this character...  LOL...

Anyway, try a new character and a new class and try starting somewhere other
than Fay...

Halfling Druids are a good character/class and they will start in Rivervale.
The Rivervale Newbie zone is very nice also and I know several people who
have gone all the way to lvl 11 before even leaving Misty Thicket.  Misty is
divided into two sections.  The section right outside Rivervale is full of
absolute newbie monsters...  If you follow the path through the wall, that
section is the next level of lowbie monsters.

Be careful of the named Gobby there...  I ran into him, didn't know who he
was, asked across the zone in /ooc about him.  I was told "Do not attack
him".  He was yellow to me at lvl 4 or 5 anyway, so that was moot.  They DID
NOT tell me not to even try to talk to him however...  LMAO!  I went up to
him, hailed him, he told me that I wasn't 'Deeppocketss' or whatever and
basically to bugger off.  I decided to ask him about this Deeppocketss
person.  He attacked me saying something like, "Didn't I tell you not to
talk to me?"  LOL  I ran to Guards.  Guards killed me.  sigh...

If you start in Qeynos, there are MANY newbie quests there...  Collect any
and all gnoll fangs you find.  They are good for faction in Qeynos and in
Everfrost.

Oh, and finally...  Destroy that @#$@$ book unless you are on PvP server.
Turning that book in gives other player free reign to kill you at any
time...  hehe

Be well and good hunting friend!
