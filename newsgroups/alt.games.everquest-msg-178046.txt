Anyone know of a site (url) where the relationship between aa points and class titles can
be researched?

I know, or at least I have been told that  a certain number of aa points must be spent in
the GENERAL category, more in the ARCHTYPE and maybe some in CLASS to get to the titles
of:

Marshal 
Exarch
Hunter
Duke
Elder
Sensei
Impresario
Marauder
Lich
Sage

 
I  have not been able to find a source of reliable data on this.

Thanks 

cml
