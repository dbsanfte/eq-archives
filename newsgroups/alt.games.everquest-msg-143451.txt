The other reason this is a good way to do it, is that the trivial level on
researching spells is far above the level of the spells.  My enchanter at
level 21 failed 3 times on trying to make her level 16 Mesmerization spell.
I found a high level enchanter, and handed them the book with the two page
halves in it, and got them to do the combine for me.
