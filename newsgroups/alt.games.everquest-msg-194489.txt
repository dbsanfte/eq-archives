>As per subject "Can the Undead in Kitchikor Forest see invisible?

Most (all?) undead see thru Invisibility/Camoflauge, as is traditional
in this sort of game.  Most (but definitely not all) undead cannot
see thru Invisibility to Undead.  In Kith there are some non-undead
mobs (who see through ItU) and also some undead mobs that can cast
some form of See Invisible (which I believe allows undead to see
through ItU).

Best bet is to run hi up along the zone wall, prefereable SoW'd,
between RV and HHP and/or RV and WC (i.e. north wall between RV
and WC).  It is rare that anyone dies doing this.
