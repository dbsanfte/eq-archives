Please define "exploiting the guards" as used in your posts.  Its clear to
me that I have no idea what you are referring to, nor can I guess what
Verant might have been thinking if they did make such a rule.

While its possible that some such rule exists, flying in the face of common
sense, after all, the state of Arkansas nearly passed a law stating that Pi
was equal to three.  Rules don't -have- to make sense.  But if you want
to site such a senseless rule, I'd sure like to see a reference.

Alternately, you are playing rules lawyer... after all, you didnt' state that
exploiting the guards was possible, just that if someone -did- manage
to find something that they could do with guards that -did- fit a definition
of an exploit that that was actionable.  That definition on the other hand
is free of information content, because -any- exploit is actionable.

Question is, is there something specific about guards of any stripe that could
be considered an exploit?
