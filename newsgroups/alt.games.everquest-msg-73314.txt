Hi.
I was wondering if anyone had figured out how AA works:
Does the amount of experience requires to gain a point depend (as it
does for regular levelling) on your current level, your race and
class?  Or is it a fixed amount, say, 25 million xp?

I'm 2 1/2 yellows into 45 now, but I am wondering if (when I hit 51,
hopefully in a month or so) should I dump 100% of my experience into
AA, build up a stash of points, and then start levelling again. (That
is, if seeing the blue xp bar oozing across the screen like frozen
molasses can be called "levelling").

Setting the AA xp percentage to 100 at level 51 or 52 would be a nice
way to keep being valid for Naggy raids, and at the same time be
squirrelling away a shedload of points for stat / still boosts.

I would hate to find out that at reaching 60 (some time in 2003,
probably!) , I have to kill ten times as many mobs (or mobs that are
ten times harder) to get the same AA points that I could have gotten
(relatively) more easily at 51.

TIA,
