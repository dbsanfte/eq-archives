The huge (and it's enormous) problem with merit/officer/GL (aka
"Buddyloot") awards is that GLs and officers in EQ are actually the
same as the rest of the people who play the game and will have the
same personal bias and issues with people who, for whatever reason,
they care or don't care for as anyone else.

My guild is presently trialling points - currently at the accumulate
but not spend stage - and so far it's going great as people can see
tangible benefits for raid attendance even though nothing drops they
would use.  We've adapted and borrowed extensively from the Afterlife
model and people can see how much each piece of loot is "worth" and
no longer have to rely on someone else's judgement.  The bidding and
class restrictions we discarded almost entirely, items are a fixed
cost and almost anyone that can use can put in if they have enough
points.

The most important part of DKP I feel is that raid attendance and
loot decisions are largely back in your own hands, if I want to go
three weeks of solid raids without putting in for anything to
accumulate enough points for a AHBS next time we do Emp then that's
more than enough motivation for me to do so.  Everything is up on the
website for members to see: loot won, loot costs, raid attendance,
raid details the whole enchilada.

I'm sure there are downsides (the not-really-here two boxing thing is
tiresome but people will exploit any system so not a whole lot you
can do) but bogus raids seems almost laughably easy to spot:

"Eh, we went to Ssra and killed, erm, stuff"
"Oh, what stuff?"
"Umm snakes"
"Named?"
"Umm, yeah AL"
"Wow, during the day?!  What dropped?"
"Umm.. some cool weapon, I forget the name"
"Ah who won it?"
"I forget"
"...."
