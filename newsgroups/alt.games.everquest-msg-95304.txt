The Steel Warrior
( http://pub14.ezboard.com/bthesteelwarrior )
has had some good posts about Warrior's Alternate
Advancement abilities (be sure to go back a few pages).
Personally, I'm of the opinion that unless you are monk (or
SK) who pulls for raids in indoor zones often, that no one
should spend experience on AA abilities before reaching 60.
The additional resists, spells, and melee capacities of 60
are much more valuable.
