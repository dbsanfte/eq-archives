Hmmm... That's an analogy that really hits home.

Well, considering only Hanrahan has a last name, you can see he's the
only one who needs pointers in Velious :). He's currently 34, but I was
waiting to be 35 before making the move (milking one last level out of
LOIO), because rotting and dotting while looking at the spellbook is
particularly unnerving, specially in zones with wanderers that can eat
you for lunch.
