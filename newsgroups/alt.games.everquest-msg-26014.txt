this is just a curiosity of mine, really . . .

if you're a master at a weapon skill -
let's say its piercing, and let's say you're, uh, at a lvl of 110

your char is lvl (hmm, do the math, roughly ) idunno, 24

and it doesn't matter what melee class you are, so lets say ranger

{here's the grand ~?~)

with whatever weapon you've been using, you hit for [some large number dmg]
,
and its a really great weapon, you have fun slicing things open, yadda yadda
yadda . . .

lets say you're on a corpse run, and just whack and loot a RUSTY rapier . .
. a crappy, common weapon - what do you hit for ??


i mean, how much of your dmg is based on YOU (i'd guess a lot) and how much
on the weapon (assuming its not 'uber' ) ??

anyone ever try this ? i'm really quite curious about how this works at mid
lvls (i still haven't broken 20 on any of 5 chars )

thanks

hey, P.S. . . .what're some of the best piercing weapons i can get for under
50pp? magic, preferably ?  AND what if i'm dual wielding ? for 50pp, what
can i do?

thanks (again)
