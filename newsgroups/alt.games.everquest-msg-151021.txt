Ok... heres the layout.
two different PC's,  two different accounts.  one PC running a
modified skin, the other using the default skin.   Both PC's will
freeze in EQ but only in the Bazaar.  when I say freeze, I can still
alt-tab out of EQ and end task on it, so the PC itself is not
freezing.  it is EQ.   of course both are running the same versions of
drivers they were the day before and yes they are the most up to date.
Freeze does seem to be completely random.  once it was 5 seconds after
getting in... another was 20 min after being in...another just 5
min...  etc.. 

anyone else having similar issues?
