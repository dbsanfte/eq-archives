Most generic mobs do have a or an. And nothing beats the stupidity of
say, "Here comes a Faydedar!"

I don't mind roleplaying one bit. I do mind "thee thou haveth ateth
thee roleplaying", when people add a ton of thees and thous and end
words with -th and say they roleplayeth. 
To me, 'Cometh' has that feel.
