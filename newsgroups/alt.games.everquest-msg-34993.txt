  I'm sure it is possible to raise enough faction with the guards by killing
things to avoid being KOS.  But raising faction with the individual guilds in
the
city (all cities) is next to impossible except via quests.  Accidently wander
into the Ogre's Shadowknight guild and you're looking at the short end of
four harm touches at once.  Adios, amigo, thanks for playing, please stop
by again.

  If you want to explore it that badly, I'd start up an Ogre.
