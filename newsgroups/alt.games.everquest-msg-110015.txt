It seems to me that Verant's idea here is to impress upon you the
huge waste of time that boats are, and that you should continue playing your
character so that you can level up enough to port yourself or so that you can
afford to buy ports from other players.  And levelling to that point requires long
hours/weeks/months to accomplish.
