It's not hard, heck, I didn't even swim when I went through Cabilis, not 
much sees invis, so by conning, and avoiding the ones that do, it's not 
hard at all to do.  I decided to work on Cabilis faction with my baby 
ranger, then 12, so I ran him through the Drachnid gauntlet to LoIO from 
FV, and soloed for quite some time near Cabilis factioning up on killing 
the mobs there.  While I was there, I did some exploring through Cabilis 
to find the safe routes through there.
