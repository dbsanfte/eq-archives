Yeah, we have floor groups too, but I hate the floor.  It seems to be 
where the 50-55ish folks go, and to be even more contentious than the 
upper spiders.  I rarely see two camps at UF/LF, but they're still 
classified as seperate camps.  Probably so the LF & TS camps can fight 
over them.  I know what tents are, though it's referred to as Village on 
Innoruuk.  Pit is pit, and I've only seen one group other than one I'm 
leading doing EXP in deep pit.  I love the pit, and explored it a bunch 
before they make bards KOS there.  Probably my all-time favorite exp-grind 
camp.  How deep does your deep-pit group set up?  Past spiders/spectres or 
at them?  (A well balanced pit group should be able to kill all dogs and 
at least the first couple spiders/spectres, so if I'm 2nd pit group, I 
generally set up past the Lord Bob camp.)

I didn't say it was tough for a raid.  It's tough for a single group, or 
so folks say.  The night we finally figured out how to chain-pull mind 
burrowers there was an exp group from another guild there, all 60+, and a 
pretty powerful guild.  They just kept dying, though a lot was probably 
because their puller didn't have run speed 3.  I think one reason that 
folks don't like mind burrowers is that they steal mana.  Never bothers 
the tanks or the bards, but the finger-wagglers get all whiny if they get 
hit.  Oh, they're also hard to mez, as in tash/OOS first or die.

Yeah, I looked at the map, and it makes sense.  How often do you have both 
D1 and D2 camped though?  I know that the few times I've camped D1 with a 
pickup group we have cleared D1, golems, and pickler at least, and these 
are generally groups averaging 55 or so.  Every now and then I play in an 
exp-grind dungeon at prime-time, and I am reminded why people get so 
frustrated with EQ.  I get so cranky when there are no mobs to pull.
