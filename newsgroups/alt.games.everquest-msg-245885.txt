Might be possible, but not the way you describe it.

First, forget #1.  The mobs are wimpy.  I can solo most mobs in Fear.  The
problem with Fear isn't how hard the mobs hit, it's how many mobs you get.

Second, might as well have the paladin pull.  Monk FDs, stands up, gets
DT'ed.  Been there, done that.  If you're lucky he gets DT'ed right away
before he gets healed and passes DT'ability to the rest of your 3-box.

Third, Dread DTs on pull.  DTs every minute.  Good luck 3-boxing it.  Only
way I see it even possible is to have a 4th character that you can log out
after taking the first DT.  DT comes 60 seconds later, even if it takes you
45 seconds to re-pull him after the sacrifice, so better have a fast system.

Oh, and fourth, you won't get him single unless you have some pretty
incredible luck and/or eat several DTs ahead of time clearing his guards.
