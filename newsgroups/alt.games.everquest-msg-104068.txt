A normal group consists of

Sponge
Healer
Crowd Control
Porter
Two open slots

Sponge is most often Warrior, although SK and Paladin can handle the
job too.  People tend to think Warrior for this slot though.

Healer is most often Cleric, although a shaman can pull this off at some
levels with a good crew... this assumes that the shaman can slow the
rate of damage down to a level where he can handle healing it.  People
-think- cleric here though more often than not.

Crowd Control is most often Enchanter, although Necros can do
the job unless its extreme, and Bards can do it if its light duty or
they are quite skilled.  More strongly than any of the other positions
people tend to think 'Chanter.

Porter.  Well, its wizard or druid, and noone else.  Outdoors druids
have the edge here with SOW and Harmony... but indoors the
higher damage output of the wizard as Nuke might give them the
edge.  Both classes snare, which is really the most important job they
do in may situations.  Plenty of groups don't bother with either, and
this makes them a glut on the market, although personally I hardly ever
go anywhere without a porter... helps that they are easy to come by.

I doubt there will ever be a lack of porters, but I've seen Warriors,
Clerics, and Enchanter's all as the class in short supply at one time
or another, currently at high end on Morel Thule it seems that
coming up with a 'Chanter is the principle stopping block, while
Clerics and Warriors have more than the usual amount of competition.
A month from now though it may well be back to a lack of Warriors.

One thing this does is force some exploration of the alternatives in
each category, I think in the past three days I've been in -one- group
with a chanter, and the groups that I did get in didn't really get off
the ground until we talked people into taking bards or necros instead.
