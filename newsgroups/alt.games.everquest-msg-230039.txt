Depends on the level... once rangers have spells its not so cut and 
dry... the warrior is going to be using archery for a maximum of like 3 
damage.

The ranger has invoke lightning pretty early, not to mention snare, 
burst of fire, etc... nowhere near the nuking power of a wizard... but 
at least he'd be able to trade blows until root wore off.

You are right about the lack of +mana armour... but in my Rallos 
Experience a naked caster could take even an armoured melee well into to 
the 20s and 30s... at which point resists and gear meant the caster 
would start to burn out of mana before making the kill... unless he was 
properly geared himself (but on RZek ... being naked has distinct 
advantages...)

> It also does bring up the innate MR warriors have from level 1.

I don't think the innate MR (or any other MR) makes much difference 
until well into the midgame even endgame, at least pvE... not too sure 
about pvp.
