    You have discovered the deterministic limitations of the human mind. If
we're arguing on that level, I challenge you to establish that I am not a
figment of your imagination.

    The problem with such discussions is that they are inherently pointless.
The really great thing about a 'logical' argument is that two people of
opposing views can come to an understanding of the opposite view and usually
learn something from one another.

    Of course I did, however my prescience and psychometry skills are not
relevant to this discussion.

    Why do I need to know Brad's original plan (now five years old) in order
to restablish that EQ2 has squished EQ1? I'm not talking about Brad, or
Verant, but Sony, and not about five years ago, but today.

    At the risk of repeating myself, I'm not going to argue capitalism VS
socialism. Also, I really don't see how that statement is relevant to this
discussion. I don't believe I was proposing a socialist solution to the
EQ1/2 problem.
