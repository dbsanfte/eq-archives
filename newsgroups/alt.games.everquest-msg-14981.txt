Since my main character is a Magician, I'm pretty limited in how I can help
someone in trouble.  If they're only in a little trouble (less than half
health, but so is the monster) I can damage sheild them, which usually puts
them on top.  However, if they're really in trouble, the only thing I can
do to help is blast the stuffing out of their opponent.  And since a few
people have jumped down my throat after I offered to help, I don't often
even bother anymore.  And except for damage shielding, I usually won't do
anything unless they respond to the question "Do you need help?"  (Which
has also gotten me yelled at, of course.  "U jst watched me die, u
bastrad.  U suXor."
