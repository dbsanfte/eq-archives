I guess it has to be said again for those who are particularly deaf. Monks
do not now and never have tank as well as warriors. Even a wizard can tank a
mob with sufficient healing.

The armor class system is broken. An ac above 1200 has no effect. This
broken item effects warriors the most since they are able to reach 1200
easily and early.

The easiest and best fix to the broken item is to add a dammage mitigating
effect for acs over 1200. This would result in warriors tanking better. This
would make gameplay easier . Uber mobs would die quicker and the long
respawn times would anger more people.

Nerfing monks is the way to make warriors happier without actually helping
them any at all, and making the whole game harder for everyone to once again
raise the bar. It is not NEARLY as egregious as the mod rod 2 nerf which
just sucks beyond all comparison.
