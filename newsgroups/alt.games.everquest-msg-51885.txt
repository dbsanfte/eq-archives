Monty Haul? Monty Haul refers to loot not downtime.

How could you twink though? You can obviously power level but give a
person a set of purple armor and it will fall to rags in very little
use with no added benefit to that person. You could twink a person
with coins for tradeskills but that still requires the time
investment.

The specific ability to look for fighters, healers etc is nice. The
Auto list all other solo and group leaders who are also looking is
nice. The Contact button that sets up a send to the person is nice.
The mini group bar with mana level icons is nice. Overall much better
then /lfg in eq.

Don't know but it's not like someone kicked you in the nuts. It's a
bug, it will get fixed.

What drivers are you running? Cities are lag intense but nothing like
what your describing here.

Backing up should be slower then running forward just like in real
life. As for getting out of buildings I get stuck occasionally on a
door, I back up I turn 15 degrees and move forward.

Not for me.
