At level 34, the answer is likely yes.  Only the most casual players would
still be in their 30s and have started before Temp existed.

As to the rest of your post...  why would you purposefully cripple yourself
if it's available?  Strategy?  What an incredibly stupid reason.  You want
to work on that strategy, instead of trying to stay alive try to stay above
50%.  That way, if your strategy doesn't work, you get to try it again right
away!   =)

Argue with me that you wouldn't have to worry about dying anyway and I'll
show you the rest of the argument about why that's a stupid reason.  =P

You want strategy?  Stay out of the LDoNs.
