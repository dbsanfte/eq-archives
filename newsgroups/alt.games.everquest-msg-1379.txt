Gee Ed, you sound like a barrel of fun.  You should get some help with your
control issues.  Not that what you say doesn't have merit, but your tone
suggests that you're a bit overbearing.

"Need before greed" is bullshit.  I'm glad it isn't the prevailing paradigm
for loot.  Some areas drops are biased toward certain classes.  If you use
the NBG model, there is little incentive for other classes to be there in
the first place.  Take Dalnir for example.  Mostly Monk loot with some Necro
and Warrior goodies.  If we use NBG, what incentive do other classes have to
be there?  Loot should be distributed, IMO, by roll.  If it isn't
appropriate for the class/race of the roll winner, it can always be sold to
obtain something that is.
