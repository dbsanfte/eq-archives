But I still don't see them cutting out EQT...most people use EQT outside 
the game, looking up recipes, planning what they are going to make, 
posting results they have made while doing tradeskills in game. I don't 
know many people flipping over to EQT in game. most people will flip to 
alla's for mob information, or to see if the mob drops something for a 
quest they might want to do.
