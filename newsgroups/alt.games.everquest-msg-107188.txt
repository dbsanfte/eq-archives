It is when they are porting you. Its a question of compareable
laziness, they have to zone at least twice with porting you and go
back to what they were doing. Unless you are actually out looking for
money, its not worth doing this for any amount since the game is so
mired in downtime. Therefore you start to kind of be picky about who
you'd port where even for money. Porting from freeport to WC is
ridiculous since it takes the porter more time than it would you just
running there. What you should have asked for was an sow/paying for an
sow. I sow people in passing all the time if I'm in a zone like
freeport, it takes hardly no time. 

When I port someone I get to be more lazy then them, not less. I don't
care how much they are paying.
