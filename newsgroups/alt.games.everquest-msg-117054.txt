Yeeeaahh, that's true.  Clerics, enchanters, monks...they can all make
DECENT level 1-40 PLers.  My main being a 57 enchanter I can tell you that
although mem blur has been improved somewhat, it's still an annoying spell;
doesn't ALWAYS blur, and the recast time is too long.  I imagine cleric
Atone is the same deal.

To PL any class using a druid:
Give PLee two fire opal rings (AC/HP)
Regen or Chloro
Skin Like *
(level 1-3) either no DS or very weak one
(level 4+) strongest DS if the PLee is able to melee fairly well. (sucks to
have a critter disappear because no damage was done except from the DS)

Druid may or may not pull, depending on zone.  Druid snares. Once the PLee
has aggro, druid has a seat and watches the show.

Shaman have to expend a lot more mana & time and they still can't snare.
Clerics, enchanters, monks all have to be much more careful not to
accidentally kill a critter.
