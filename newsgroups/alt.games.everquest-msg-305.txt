Agree, a 36 Shadowknight, 34 Necro, and my 36 druid held the Gooey and
neighboring rooms on the second floor of Dilnar (hope I spelled that
right?).

Then again, I can tell you a hundred horror stories about inept
chanters and clerics.

I've even grouped in my 20s with only a rogue and my druid on the
Oasis Orc highway. 

The only thing I insist on when attempting a dungeon crawl is that
there be two tanks and a healer. Fill in the rest with whatever is
available. (Yes, I broke my rule in Dilnar and I came close to death
several times casting a heal on the tank with multiple MoBs attacking.
The point was, the group was viable without a cleric or chanter, even
though it was a struggle).
