Didya actually know there are some quite interesting stuff here? A few
kobold camps, a wandering troll, poachers, some nice low level quests, both
linked to Paineel, Erudin, and just for fun one's. If you're lukcy you might
even see a pixie or two. Oh, not to forget the Emissaries, and other
Erudites wandering about... a lot more going on than you think at first
hand. :o) (yes, I know you're not talking no of mobs, but I am trying to get
across that the mobs that are there are interesting, and many have quest
purposes... still wondering what that troll does there)
