In EQ1, though, there were other racial differences that did matter 
somewhat, for example the "large" races got the ability to Slam, to use 
their bash skill (which can interrupt casters) without a shield in hand. 
  This didn't matter much for a class that couldn't train their bash 
skill up like my berserker, but was a noticable advantage for any class 
that could use a shield but was more likely to use a two hander or dual 
weild one handers.   This advantage was not one that could be dealt with 
later by gear or buffs; no matter what level your dwarf warrior was he'd 
never ever be able to bash without giving up some of his damage output.

Similarly, Clerics and Shaman of Innorruuk could get a snare necklace, 
snare on demand makes a good many mobs a good deal easier to kill... but 
only DE and Human clerics, only Troll shaman, could get that neck, and 
there was no amount of gear or buff (with the exception of some snare 
items that used charges) that would make up for that.

Vah Shir bards could get a lute usuable from the primary slot via a 
simple quest, achievable before hitting level 6, even untwinked solo. 
This one could be compensated for by getting a Lute of the Howler, or 
your Epic, or post POP some other Strings items that aren't Secondary 
slot... but nothing at all as easy as this Vah Shir item.

I picked Barbarian for my Berserker.  Bad choice, the Slam ability was 
worthless since I couldn't train the underlying Bash skill.  Better 
would have been Troll, for more regen (I used regen a -lot- in my 
career) or Ogre, to avoid being stunned in melee from the front (I was 
MT or solo a -lot- during my career)

These advantages, and others like them, were relatively small, but they 
certainly did make a difference that didn't vanish after a few levels of 
play.

Further, I liked that about EQ, except that I wished they'd done more of 
it.  IMO every race should have its advantages and disadvantages, 
multiplying the number of character choices out there (if there are 5 
races per class, and each makes a different combination, then there are 
5 times as many possibilities as there are when the races make no 
difference)
