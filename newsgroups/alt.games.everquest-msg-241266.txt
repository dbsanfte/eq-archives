I doubt it'll sooth your ego much, but I wasn't attacking you
directly.

I was just using your post as an example of the type of things that
are posted here on a regular basis. Vulgar, whining, childish, and
hypercritical. You certainly have a valid complaint, but your post
matched so well the common theme of most of the other whiner posts,
that it was perfect for my purposes of parody.

The idea was to illustrate my opinion that any dynamic game will have
it's problems. Additionally that it is wishful thinking that
everything would be fine if only it wasn't SOE (who doesnï¿½t give a
rats ass about their player base) behind the wheel.

Honestly, if SOE never provided new content, would that be a sign that
they cared about their player base? I doubt it. Sure it would be
better if SOE did bug test things more thoroughly, but I am absolutely
willing to accept bugs and the resulting time it will take to fix them
if it means getting more content.

If one day it does get to the point that SOE drops something on us
that does "Break my Toy", I will vote with my wallet, though I won't
be in here bitching about it. I've quit EQ twice already, and both
times come back, because EQ is a great game, ultimately pointless, but
the new content allows me to forget about that for a while.

So in conclusion, I will not apologize for using your post as an
example, but I wasn't attacking you directly. Your post just fit
perfectly the material I needed to make my point, and if that isn't
good enough for you, then all I can say is welcome to Usenet.
