Same with all items, go with a cleric friend or druid friend or any caster
friend able to help you.

Wurmslayer is a weapon for a warrior, but a warrior isn't going to solo the
named wurms that drop the scales etc.

Get a friend to help you get the ring, then go beat crap out of a shadowed
man and then to carry the 2250 gold pieces you still gonna need the help of
someone with sow to hail him for you to stop him so you can heave and sweat
as you drag all that gold over to hand in :o)
