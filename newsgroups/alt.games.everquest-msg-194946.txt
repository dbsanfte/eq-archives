How much u payin? for $135 + tax (shipping is free) you can get yourself a
lovely ABIT Siluro GeForce4 Ti4200 128MB 8X Retail agp card.  My experience
with the GeForce MX 400 Series is that even though they are in 64 or 128 meg
cards, they might as well be free and 32 megs cause that is the bulk of the
performance.  Spend the extra dough and get quality over cheapness.....

P.S. I just upgraded my MX 440 to a ti4200 and am blown away by the change
and quality of the graphics.
