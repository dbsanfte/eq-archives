Just checked Caster's realm for lvl 24 Dot for Shaman.  There is 
supposed to be an NPC at the hands in Innothule who sells that.  With 
all the changes in that area, I'm not sure he's still there.  Can also 
be bought in Cabilis if you can get in that town, not sure but I think 
those lizards hate everyone and barely tolerate their own race.
