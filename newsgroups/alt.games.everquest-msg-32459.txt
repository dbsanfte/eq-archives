I invariably root first if I have the time and don't need to cast a
heal RIGHT NOW.  Root breaks.  A lot.  Gets resisted.  A lot.  If I
always waited until I had all unengaged mobs rooted first, the tanks
would die.  A lot.

Do you have any idea what a PITA it is to have two mobs beating on you
while the tanks haven't even NOTICED that they're only fighting one
now?

Couldn't disagree more.  Crowd control is everyone's responsibility,
if you don't have a dedicated crowd control person like an enchanter.
And yes, a tank CAN do crowd control.  They SHOULD have to.

You are assuming I'm not doing something I habitually do.

Sure you can.  My warrior almost invariably finds it real easy to tell
when a mob has suddenly stopped beating on him.

Depends.  If there aren't too many overpulls, if you're fighting
blues, fine.

There I agree with you and that cleric was wrong not to say anything.

I don't think it's unfounded at all.

If you've got an enchanter, yes, crowd control is their responsibiliy,
no one else's.  If you're only pulling small amounts of blues, then
usually the clerics or druids can handle the rooting/snaring/etc.

If you're living dangerously, then, yep, crowd control is your job
too.
