If you get really hard up, you could AAXP the mushrooms in Fungus Grove.  I
think they should still be blue at 62 and they spend most of their time
casting spells that the earth pet is completely immune to.  Not something
I'd necessarily recommend, but I did them at 65 while waiting for better
things to happen.  At 65, I could get 1% every two kills, so they should be
a bit better at 62.  The problem I had was that, while they weren't very
damaging, they had enough hp's to make killing them a bit time consuming.
