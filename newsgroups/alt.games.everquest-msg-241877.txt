Well, I'm back online... but can't connect with EQ.

Wondering if anyone out there is running thru a Verizon Cellphone
connection, which is what I've got up and running at the moment...  I
can get the web fine, in fact it looks like a faster connection than
my land line with a 56k modem (says here 230kbps... is that the same
sort of k as the k in 56k?

But when I try to log in EQ, I get the message:

Could not establish a connection.  Please check your network
connection, or contact eqtech@soe.sony.com

in one box, which is labled Connection Failure, and a second box
labled Patching Everquest, which is just a little window with the word
Connecting... (elipses included... and the last period of the three is
blinking)

If anyone else is insane enough to be trying this, I'm using a "mobile
office kit" with a USB connection to a Motorola phone, connecting to
Express Network 1XRTT (free, more or less, to Verizon customers, which
is to say it only costs normal minute rates, and thus is free nights
and weekends) via Quicklink Mobile

At any rate, at least I'm able to get to the newsgroup for the next
couple months, till I'm back to a land line, sort of a methadone to
keep the EQ jones down a bit.  Arizona is over, but now its two months
in Texas.
