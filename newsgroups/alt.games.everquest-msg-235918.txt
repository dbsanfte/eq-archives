*Bang* you'e dead.

}If I say I'm sorry, and I screwed up, will ya forgive me?

}And I retried all the searches I did before thatpost, and can't find the 
}connection that was there (to me) the first time.
}For the record, I stand corrected, and withdraw my argument.

Cool.  It was a silly argument anyway. :)
