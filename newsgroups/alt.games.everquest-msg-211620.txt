It all depends on what context you use the words "it's just a game". I think
in the context that was specified by the original poster, well, the phrase
"it's just a game" is asinine. I suspect that generally, people who use the
phrase "it's just a game" use it to justify their or someone else's
abberrant behaviour.

In your case, I understand it as "there are things that are more important
than this" when you say "it's just a game". It's similar to telling someone
"it's just a job" when there are things that are so important that the loss
of a specific job pales in comparison. Just as it is dangerous for a person
to put a job at such a high priority that it overrides all other things it
is the same for Everquest. Yet often a job is not merely a "job" in the
sense that it is a source of income. Often a job contributes to self-worth
and other higher order needs - as such, it is not merely a "job".
Considering the time and effort many players of Everquest contribute to the
game as well as the sense of community that has arisen from this hobby it is
almost... puerile... to say that Everquest is "just a game".

Therefore, without context, you can't determine whether the phrase "it's
just a game" suitable or not suitable.
