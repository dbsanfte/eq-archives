Whether or not he's talking out his ass; whether or not he's got a fear of
PvP, played the game or enjoy bashing the game again and again, one thing
remains the same.

He's right.  DAOC sucks.  The RvR is the only...the ONLY good thing about
it.

I have at least 50 hours /played in DAOC (enough to get my char to 17 and
300 skill in tailoring doing all consignments...it's probably closer to 100
/played but I'll be conservative).
