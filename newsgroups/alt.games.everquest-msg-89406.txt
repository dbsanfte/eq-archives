In truth, there may be something to complain about from time to time. I
have had mixed experiences with in game customer service. I have had a
GM show up within minutes to pull a lost corpse out of the wall, but I
once sat in what looked like a little cardboard box under the Hole for 6
hrs. waiting for someone to show up and get me the hell out of there (to
be fair, the GM who finally appeared was very nice about it, but 6 hrs.
is a very long time to wait.) I have watched someone get screwed out of
their epic when an uber guild ks'ed the mob they needed with a guide
watching the whole thing fer cryin' out loud! Guide agreed that we had
been ks'ed and called the senior GM. We wait 4 hrs. Even with testimony
in our favor from a member of Verant's customer service staff, GM shrugs
and says can't help you, tough luck, and splits. Just seems depends on
the time of day and the server and whether the gm/guide on duty is
having a bad hair day. /shrug
