] What size were the leather armor pieces?

I don't think a size was associated with the name. All started out
wearing small cloth sandals.

All 3 of my characters are half-elf warriors. One, fifth level,
cannot wear boots. A 4th level one can wear boots.

Yup, found screen shots. 4th level half-elf warrior wearing leather
boots. 5th level warrior bought leather boots, got the above
message.

I also found my 4th level warrior wearing cloth sleeves, and I tried
earlier Tuesday evening to wear cloth sleeves on the 5th level
warror. Got the subject line error message on the 5th level warrior
for cloth sleeves.

So, I don't see what the different might be... except the 5th
level's deity is Mithaniel Marr, and the 4th is agnostic. Yet, the
5th level is wearing a leather tunic, leather gloves,and leather
sleeves. So I see no reason for the 5th level warrior to not be able
to wear leather boots.

thanks,
JimP.
