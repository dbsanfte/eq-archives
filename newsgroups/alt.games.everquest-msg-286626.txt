I stated that the sort of negligence you were claiming would have often 
resulted in client crashes and that we have not seen everyone crashing 
after a patch (ever? dunno). You thought it necessary to also debate 
whether or not we're seeing client crashes, obviously in the interest of 
discounting that particular line of reasoning on my part.

Round and round we go. When you'll stop arguing for the sake of it, nobody 
knows.

Whatever. In your arrogance, you're not interested in hearing anything 
inconsistent with your own views. You've already decided that you're right 
beyond a shadow of a doubt, even though you have nothing but circumstantial 
and unprivileged observation on which to base your claims. There's no hope 
for discussion under these circumstances.

I'll just repeat it for the record: SoE does not roll out significant game 
updates (such as the AA redesign) without *any* testing at all. To claim 
bugs as proof that they do is a non sequitur. It's ridiculous.
