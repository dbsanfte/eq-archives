Too much to expect in a pickup group, I think. ... unless you have one
higher lvl caster in the group that can root dependably on incoming.
Having someone run mobs around while a shaman tries to land slow is a
receipe for disaster in an exp group imo. It might work a few times
but something will go wrong eventually.

I'm not saying that being outclassed somewhere can't be fun <g>.

I'd argue that any of those points, by definition, show a group that's
outclassed in a specific area. If you can't handle an add or two and
there's a reasonable chance that the puller will get an occasional
add, if you can't keep a tank alive on even one mob with a couple of
slow resists (and you don't have malo or tash to guarantee that slow
lands early) then you're in over your head. Trying that with a pickup
group just makes it worse.
