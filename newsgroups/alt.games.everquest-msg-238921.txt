Actually they nerf it, the thing next to it, the things that have
names similar to it, the next three things said after it is mentioned,
and five random things with no connection to it, just in case.

Mythic nerfs five things to Sony's one. Archerbear is probably just
getting into the game and doesn't realize this yet.
