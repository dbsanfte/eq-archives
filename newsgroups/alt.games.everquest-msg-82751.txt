There is a way to fish from the boats; just change position
after every cast.  I noticed this by accident, when my first
cast was successful but subsequent casts were not.  So I moved
and got a new "first" cast.  So cast, wait until the button
recycles, move to another spot on deck and cast again.

I once thought I had found a spot on deck, near the mast,
where it was possible to cast over and over again; but I've
never been able to find that magic spot again.  :-/
