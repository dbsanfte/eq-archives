I make stat enhancing food for my rogue. It doesn't have to be in the top
left slot, it only has to be above any other food item for it to take
effect. You do not have to eat it immediatly either. It could be in the
bottom left bag in the bottom left slot if you wanted as long as the other
food was in the right hand side bags. The way the bags are
searched/fill/emptied are as follows
Left side     Right Side
1                    5

2                    6

3                    7

4                    8

Not sure how it works for the bags but I believe it is something like this

Left Side        Right Side
1                    2
3                    4
5                    6
7                    8
9                    10

Hope this helps
