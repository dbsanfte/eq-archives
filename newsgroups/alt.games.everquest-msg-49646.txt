I'm betting this -isn't- out there anywhere, but I'll ask.

Any source out there on the net for the resist levels of various
mobs?

I"ve been happily slaughtering red to me DW Crocs and DE
Guards... but I made the trip out to OOT aviak island and
found myself almost completely unable to stick snare or root
on the aviaks there.  Was a little annoying when I couldn't
snare the yellow Tanager when he started to run... became
an actual concern when I spent most of my mana before finally
managing to root the two blue Turacoes that added when
the runner got to them before dying, so that I could levitate myself
and run out of follow range.

I gated out; one yellow would have been a fluke, but two blues?
Every fight I did there would have ended up with adds from runners,
and thats just not something I enjoy.

Point is, how would I have known in advance that those Aviaks would
have such outrageous resists?
