Holy fucking guacamolie, Batman! Now I've not only got to buy two video
cards, but I've got to get two different *types* of the same card and
figure out which one goes in which??!!??

Let's just assume everyone is going to call me clueless to save space,
and take it as written. Can somebody clue me in on the definitions of
PCI and AGP and give some tips on how to tell the difference?

Well, it's been nice playing EQ with ya'll. After the machine explodes
on me when I try all this black magic, I'll try to drop a line in here
when I get out of the hospital.
