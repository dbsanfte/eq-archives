While I won't dispute the utility of BL buffs, it would be rather silly 
to take Kragg and IoS over Fo7 and Boar.

Kragg is 395hp
IoS is 45 Stamina

So, that's 395hp and 45 Stamina.

Fo7 is 544hp
Boar is 60 Stamina
So, that's 544hp and 60 stamina, and 70 Dex for the same 2 buff slots.

Now, for melee, SoT gives 60 ATK and 125hp
SV gives 40ATK and 225hp
for Nonmelee, BSS gives 330hp

As a nonmelee, I will take BSS+Fo7+Boar every time.

Personally, I love having a BL along, extra mana regen, very nice DPS.
