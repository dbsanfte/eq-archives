Likewise.  Sneak and Hide never drop unless by accident or maybe some kind
of glitch.  I've gone AFK over night once (in a safe area) and been still
hiding when I returned.  I, too, have never heard of anybody else's S/H
dropping.

Post 50, rogues start to Sneak faster.  At 60th, there is no difference in
movement.

Precisely why I blew a huge sum of cash mid-30s on Tboots.  Sneaking while
un-SoWed can be painfully slow.

No difference in Sneak speed at all until 50s.

As an instruction, it's much more correct to say that mobs see through Hide
but not Sneak.  I've heard some people saying that certain mobs can see
through Sneak but I've not yet seen any of those claims confirmed.  I know
rogues who have sat Sneaking behind Naggy for screenshots, etc.

Likewise, that's a chance to see through the Hide, not the Sneak portion.

There's ways around that which I've documented at my site:

USUALLY.  Non-rogues never get Hide or Sneak messages, period.  Rogues get
messages that Hide has dropped or failed in *combat* but if you were hidden
when you started looting, your Hide key will remain greyed out and you'll
get no message.
