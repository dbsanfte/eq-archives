I don't think it's changed much, Ray.  As a 52 mage (with no alt and 93
stinkin playing hours...gotta lub running a guild) I am very aware of that
pet.  Some mentionables:

- Mages who exclusively use earth pets live in a different world than all
other pet classes.  Since the pet roots constantly and (most) mages use
their malaise series, those things stay in one place.  Period.  They don't
have to deal with the aggro stealing.

- There was a big nerf in that mobs prefer to hit the sitting mobs.  A quick
adjustment (which, IMHO should have been made before anyway) to wait till
the main tank/pet builds up sufficient aggro before sitting is in order.

- Multiple mobs still tend to stick to your engaged-pet-with-mob.  Evidently
seeing their friend die still holds more hate for them (don't siddown
though).

So if you're a mage, try switching pets to see the adjustment (and discover
the joy of what those other 3, lil elements can do.  =D)
