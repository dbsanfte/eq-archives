True. But the boat made places 'far' away. It could take hours to get 
from places in Kunark to Velious for example. That aspect of it was a 
'goodthing'.

The mindless tedium of actually sitting on the boat wasn't.

But the brainless convenience of the pok books isn't 'better' either. 
Something had to be done to improve on the boats... but rolling over and 
giving the players free instant teleports to nearly every city in the 
game was just silly.  Asherons Call's various portal highways were a 
much better compromise for example.
