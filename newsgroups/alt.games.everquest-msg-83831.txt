I could care less if its a single.  Since nobody past 35 needs to
stare at their book anymore, they should be aware there is a mob in
front of us.  Howerver, hitting the inc button once for every add
seems ok so the chanter knows she needs to start mezzing or so that I
know I should use celest. heal for low agro until its under control.

> Cleric tells the group, 'Healing Puller, stay in range please.'
Useselss unless your puller is so dumb to go off pulling with 10hp...
in which case he just shouldnt be in your group.  The only time I use
heal messages is for complete heals since it is a 10 second heal and
the baby healers (shammys/druids) dont get their panties in a bunch
and start wasting mana healing.


> Chanter tells the group, 'Mesmerizing an Uglymob! Don't attack it please!'
Tells me I can use high agro heals without being smacked around.

Tells me the wizard isn't asleep ;)  useless, i agree.  this is one of
those "hey look i can contribute to the group" messages.

> Shaman tells the group, 'The an Uglymob has been slowed!'
VERY important to me.  This means i can complete heal at 1/2-1 bub of
life instead of 2-2.5 bubs of life.

useless to me.
