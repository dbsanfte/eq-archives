Oh, thanks, I'll give that a try then. While I have you here :-)  I'm looking 
for a character to play, and I see you have a Beastlord and Shaman. I
used to play spellcasters and the like, but I want a character who can
do some serious whacking with a weapon. I've never really played
that type of character before. BUT I have to solo often [ because of when
and how long I can play, and occasionally because I just like it ] so my
character would have to be able to solo, which means some ability to 
heal I guess [ or have a pet ? ] Can the Shaman or Beastlord do some 
good whackin' ? 

Thanks
Jim
