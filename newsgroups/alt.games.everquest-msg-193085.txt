Even at level 65, and assuming a wisdom under 200, the 40 mana is more than 
2 wisdom would give you.  For mana pool purposes, the 3 wisdom, 40 mana 
item is always better.  Other stats on the items could make a difference as 
to which is better, as well as considerations of whether or not you are 
doing a lot of tradeskills.
