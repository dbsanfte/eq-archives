Well, if you have INT-only stat items you can dump them...INT is useless to
a druid.

STR is ok though I bet it's a royal pain to keep below 78 in loot, huh?  I'd
carry some STR jewelry for those times where WIS isn't that important and
you're getting weighed down.

AGI is fine.  More is nice, but don't worry too much about it.

You're right about DEX for a druid so if you don't have a proc'ing weapon I
wouldn't worry about it.

Buy CHA items to keep with you at all times (not necessary to WEAR all the
time, but just have it with you)...there's occasions where you'll want to
charm an animal and 75 CHA isn't really enough.  Plus, of course, you get
the best possible price from vendors (faction and probably religion have
something to do with price too, but CHA is easiest to do something about)
when your CHA is at 115.

Obviously you want more WIS but yours is higher than my druid's was at 30.
