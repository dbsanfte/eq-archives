Yeah, not much argument there - I've tried before to come up with an
explanation for that odd fact, but never found one.

I confess, though, I rather like Michael W. Smith's "Rocket Town",
which I had the pleasure of seeing him perform live back in the
mid-80s. Of course, I've always been in love with the 80s synth sound,
so my opinion may be colored.

Yes. And it may disturb you to hear it, but you're currently fairly
high on my scale.

I'm glad you said it, so that I can agree with you :)
