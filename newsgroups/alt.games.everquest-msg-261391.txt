Have you picked it up yet? Its turned out to be much more of an 
adventure game than the rpg I was anticipating, but nonetheless I'm 
having fun with it on my first run. I think it'll provide a nice break 
for the 15-20 hours it sounds like it will probably take to finish.

Being in the low end of the EQ spectrum with no chance of ever seeing 
the newest content (and little desire to), I'm pretty easily distracted 
by stuff like this.
