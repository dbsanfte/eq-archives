I've read the log from top to bottom and I truly believe that the only
reason they were banned was because Mr. Butler is a big baby that had his
little plotline spoiled before he was able to finish the next episode.

I wonder if all the Warders were despawned on EVERY server to stop the
script that would kick in massive changes across all of EQ...ones that they
aren't ready for.

I think Mr Butler is pissed because someone gave away the ending of the book
by reading the last page first...
