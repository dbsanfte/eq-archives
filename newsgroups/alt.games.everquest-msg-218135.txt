Ah I see... so if you, me and SOE take some kid and rake his emotions 
through the coals, tear his life apart brick by brick, and then suggest 
he end it all, provide him a gun, and effectively drive him to commit a 
murder suicide... well...

The we should throw his parents in jail for spawning and raising an 
inferior speciman of humanity?

I mean, sure, you, me, and SOE did all the damage... but hey, if they 
want to hold us responsible, then his parents should have asked us for a 
'by your leave' before they conceived in the first place.

Isn't that what you said? Surely you wouldn't have... except you did... 
that was, in fact, your whole point.
