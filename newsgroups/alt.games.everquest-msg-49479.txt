Duck stick? :p
I let my mage hold a darkwood staff, since it looks less tacky than
the water/fire/slime crystal staves. And as for fashion; shall we
discuss her collection of dresses? (Brown Advisor, white gossimer,
gold newbie, purplered AC 2 dress that cost me 6 silver in the
Freeport guild, and one day - Froglok bonecaster :) )
My shadow knight now has darkforge boots, tunic and legs. So, I need
to get a red darkforge bracer, since the rygorr sleeves and silver
plated bracer 'clash' with the boots. At least her cracked darkwood
shield is reddish and can help set off the boots.
My warrior is all visible crafted except tunic and helm, and has a
dusty BP or a brigadine tunic to set off that stuff. (I need hero
bracers for both of those girls!) 
My melees will never wield can openers (wurmslayer)...

A monk friend of mine has the redhaired human guy, and is color
coordinating all his gear to go with the hair and the brown/red robe.
