Ok.... granted I've never visted PoG yet, but a ranger in our guild
(treehugger) went there alone just to walk around and look and reported
back to us that he had no problems. I would assume that any quest
interaction the druid needs to do in PoG could be done simply by popping
in there to say hi.  He/she wouldn't need a "raid" to do that, would he?

Ok, now I'm not a Druid (though I do play one on TV) but wouldn't you
think "Shadow Knight" might be a teensy hint?
