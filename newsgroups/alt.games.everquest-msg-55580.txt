>>>I bet monks are going to be irritated with having to confirm the
destruction of 421 copper every 2 minutes<<<

You can set it to "fast destroy" (not sure if that's the correct name). When
you have fast destroy on, you do not see the destroy conformation box. It
just destroys whatever.

Would be useful for coinage, just make sure anything else you destroy is
really what you wanted to destroy.
