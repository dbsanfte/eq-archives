Lol, that is certainly an amusing viewpoint.  A necro is probably the 
single class with the least downtime between kills of all classes in EQ.  
Furthermore, once a necro is high enough level for KEI, he has a better 
self mana regen already, and it does not stack with KEI.

At 62, as a shaman, I solo dark blue mobs in PoN with little to no 
downtime between kills.  As a shaman I also have a much faster than KEI 
mana regen method.  Unlike the necro however, mine stacks with KEI.
