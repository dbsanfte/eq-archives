Ok thanks, I'll have to recheck whats the problem is.  I could have
sworn that the flute was finished but now I wonder, and if it is
unfinished then that would explain why I couldn't equip in the second
weapon or the first weapon slot.  If I have to I'll go purchase
another instrument.

But wait, I can't equip any other instruments this way either,
tamborien, Lute (finished) or horn.  is there anything that would
prevent me from equipping an instrument?

Confused Bard :(
