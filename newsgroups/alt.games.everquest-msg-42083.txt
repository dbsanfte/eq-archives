Yes. No other epic has such wide ranging upsides.

It saves tremendous amounts of mana. Reviviscence costs SIX HUNDRED mana.
Even with Clarity II, that is a minute and a half of meditation time to
recover.

Since the cleric epic is such a desired item, clerics often get it before
they get 56th level, and the ability to cast the spell directly.

Recovering from a wipeout, the cleric can loot the one item of his corpse,
and immediately start bringing people back, rather than looting
all-but-one-item to build up mana reserves, and then medding forever.

It means that in a wipeout, you don't have to rez all the clerics first
just so they can help with the rezzing...can bring up enough people to
adequately defend yourselves during the recovery.

It means the cleric never needs to waste a spell slot and the time in
memorizing a ressurection spell ever again.

Even outside of raid use, cleric epics have no doubt saved players tens of
thousands of hours in playtime with rezzes that they would not have
otherwise received. Clerics are hounded enough for them anyway, and many
will not bother to blow their entire mana bar on a pile of losers at the KC
zone-in while they are trying to do hunting of their own. Epic makes this
work trivial. I would doubt that all other epics combined have not saved
players even 1% of the xp that the cleric one has.

A cleric with epic is at least three times more valuable than a cleric
without it. There are only 2 other classes that get an upgrade so
substantial from their epic. Rogue, and Bard. You may notice that I rated
their epic power at the top of the scale as well.
