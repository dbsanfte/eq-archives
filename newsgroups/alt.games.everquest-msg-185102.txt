    kick that interface altogether and add a "buy" button to the /bazaar
window.

    The zone is far too jerky for anyone to really enjoy it anyway. Was an
ok idea but the technology doesn'rt really support it. Go back to offline
trading with a boring (but actually useable) interface and use the cool idea
when the tech catches up.
