It's a new variation of the teenie wolf bug (which incidently is now a 
medium-sized wolf bug instead).  Noticed it last night while gathering for 
a guild event. Two of us were in tree form when some guildies zoned in. We 
then turned it off but those who hadn't been there before we used treeform 
didn't see it drop, only saw us as running trees. Those who were there 
when we cast it, saw it drop off as well.

So yes, there's running trees, but not really =)
