EQ has always been a  massively-multiplayer online role-playing game (MMPORG), not a FPS
or a solo dungeon.  Solo play is traditionally discouraged, hence the release of LDoN.  I
submit that anything different would not be "EQ".

It's difficult, nay impossible, to level on quest XP alone.  You must kill to level.

At higher levels the MOBs start rewarding less XP and become harder to kill, such that a
group is required to earn XP.  For most classes.  NEC and SHM remain soloing machines ;->

That being said, I've achieved my current level of 52 mostly through soloing.  I grouped a
little in my mid-twenties, in LOIO before the ZEM nerf, but never grouped much otherwise.
Part of my hesitation is that there seems to always be dangerously ignorant folks in my
group.  Even yesterday's Fear zerg raid was way too chaotic for my tastes.  Luck of the
draw, I guess.

I anticipate that, as a hybrid, my soloing days are rapidly drawing to a close.  As I
level, it becomes harder and harder for me to find spots where I can earn 1% XP per
high-blue kill.  And, even at that, I have to be wearing KEI to make the heal/battle cycle
reasonable.

Best regards,
