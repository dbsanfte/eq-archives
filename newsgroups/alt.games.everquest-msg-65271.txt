Make the old one a legacy server...ie no upgrades and patches....it covers
yuorself for older gamers who cant/wont upgrade...its been done before.
Then you arent maintaining a seperate code....if the server crashes simply
restart at last save. This should involve a fairly limited amount of work,
a fairly low bandwidth server compared to the other however many, and
cover VI from assorted trade rules in various teritories. 

Though as you have pointed out....upgrading aint difficult.
