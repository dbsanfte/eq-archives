Lord Inquisitor Seru, the overlord of Sanctus Seru, wears black plate armor
with a really big torque that covers up to his nose or so, wields a giant
spiked black sword called the Sword of Truth.  Has a metric assload of hp,
can only be hit by either fists (without bane dmg), spells (without bane
dmg), or weapons with Bane dmg: Seru.  Also has a rain AoE that he proc's a
LOT and that does a load of damage.  Can only be reached after completion of
TimeSink_06 for keys with (5?) charges of Arx Foris, which ports a group
into the Arx to engage Seru himself, as well as TimeSink_07 for Serubane
weapons for your melee's.
