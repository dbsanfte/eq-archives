Well, I don't see #auction as a panacea for everyone's problems they may
encounter in Norrathian shopping, and there will be occasional cases
like the one Biz mentions where it's not nearly as convenient. But I can
also see a host of situations, partiularly for people hunting anywhere
but the moon, where it could make the buying and selling process a lot
less painful.
