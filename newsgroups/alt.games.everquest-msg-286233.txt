So, I'm going to be picking up the Anniversary Edition some time this
week, so I can start playing again.  It's literally been years (quit a
couple months before PoP), and my account long ago succumbed to
overdue bills.  So, I'm starting 100% fresh.

Now, I'm looking for server recommendations.  I know that the low-
level population is more or less non-existant, but I was wondering if
there was any chance at all to find folks.  I enjoy grouping, but I'll
only have 8hrs or so a week to play, so it's not like I'm in a hurry
to level up and raid.

Anyone know of a server/guild that is pretty casual-friendly, enjoys
grouping, maybe even raids casually?  I figure I'll be able to level
up relatively quickly if there's a decent population of folks from
20-40 to group with.
