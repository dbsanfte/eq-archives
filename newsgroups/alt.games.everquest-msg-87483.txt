Just my opinion but if I were the monk I would have been upset too,
obviously the group figured he was coming back since they took the time to
find a necro to locate the corpse and tried to find a cleric for a rez. If
this were a group of just guild members I would have raised all hell over
it, but considering it was only a group with one other guildmate in it (if i
read right) I wouldn't have removed myself from guild over it since the
guildmate may not have had the final say (if I were the guildmate I would
have left with the monk though).
