Wait...you're complaining because you couldn't get a drop that can be
sold for a multiquest for 5k without having to sit and wait for a
spawn for hours? A drop for a quest item you had no need for and
therefore would have been denying someone who actually needed the item
because you're a greedy asshole?

You realize that in the time it takes to wait for the AC to spawn you
could probably EARN that much plat?
