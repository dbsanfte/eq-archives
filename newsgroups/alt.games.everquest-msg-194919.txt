My necro uses a Soul Reaper which has the scythe appearance.  I looted
several of them off a named mob in Acrylia Caverns.  At the time it sold for
1500-2000pp in bazaar.  However, with the revamp of Acrylia this mob no
longer exists, so the item will not be as commonly sold in bazaar.

Stats are Str+6, Int+6, HP+25, Mana+25, SV Disease+10, Channeling+3%
Primary/Secondary
Necro only
