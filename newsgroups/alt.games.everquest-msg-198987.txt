At level 27 your skill caps should be around 140.  Throw 20 or 30 points 
training points at it and go nuts.  Should be up to speed in a night or two 
if your DEX isn't horrendous.

Other things to note: 
Get the fastest weapon of that class that you can find, regardless of ratio 
at first.  The increased number of attempts to hit will lead to more 
skillups.  You can swap it back out for that nicer one when you're 
connecting a greater percentage of the time (I've never seen a skillup from 
a miss).

Dual wield two weapons of that class.  (Roughly) twice as many hits = 
skilling up twice as quickly!

A great time to practice melee skills is while clearing stuff on raids 
where you're not tanking and don't care about having to grab aggro.  This 
of course depends on your guild raiding places with blue+ cons.  I maxxed 
my piercing starting from 0 at level 58 in just a few nights of doing this.

Group like normal, and just ask if anybody minds if you try to get skill 
increases in 1hs.  As long as you can hold aggro, nobody should mind 
anyway.  And if they say "no" then screw 'em and leave the group :D  Once 
you're in the 100s you can probably safely tank using the weapons anyway.

Start working on any other 2 hand skills that you have NOW.  They raise 
much slower than 1 hand skills, so it really pays to get them maxxed as 
early on as possible.  I'm really not looking forward to skilling this one 
up from 0 at level 59 :P
