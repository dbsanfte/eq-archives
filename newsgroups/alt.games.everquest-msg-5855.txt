I had just got done killing Thistle Undeerbush in LFay and had ported
to Steamfont. Just as I arrived I got a message as follows:

Seczet says, I'll be your mana battery one day.

Anyone know what that is all about and who Seczet is?  Is it related
to me killing Thistle Underbush or just a coincidence upon appearing
in Steamfont after I ported there?

By the way, Thistle didn't drop the Braided Ivy Cords this time, I did
get them the first time I killed him, but he sure is a tuff little guy
that conned green to my lvl 30 Druid.  He got me down to 2 bubbles of
health before I finally dropped him.  One of the better fights I've
been in lately.

Thanks for the help
