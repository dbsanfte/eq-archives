That was the point everyone was flaming are calling druids whiners for
wanting anything because they were too powerful.  I was for the druids
because they needed a balance.

If you have any of the post from that thread go back and read them
"Druids Cry Foul" you should read the posts.  There were probably 4

everyone else stated that druids were overpowered.  

Basically I am saying nah nah nah nah.  I told you the druids would
get something.
