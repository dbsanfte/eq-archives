During the 10th ring quest, mobs in GD and the nexus scion will dissappear.
The event lasts for about 45 minutes (if properly prepared for), and then
everything comes back.  Not sure if this is what was happening but its a
possibility.  It's hilarious to hear all the "WTF where did the scion go?"
shouts and OOC's.
