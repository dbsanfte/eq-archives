Me... that's a hard question...   Personal opinion:  

Religion (all Religion) is full of trappings to help hone the mind to
a "greater power".  Now, what this power is?  I don't know... Is it a
MAN? hell no... is it a Woman,  same answer..    
some individuals feel better worshiping a single god, others worship
many.   It is all in what makes you feel right in the world.  
The one true thing I think that stands through all decent religions
is..  

HARM NONE. 
Do as you will. (as long as it doesn't conflict with the harm none)

I have used various belief systems as correspondences for certain
effects in need/want in my practice.

If you want to find some understanding to the Basis of what I have
stated.   look at the book   "Magic Primer"
Just the beginning for the basis of Magic and what it is.    The
latter chapters are more focusing on the Qabala and its art.
