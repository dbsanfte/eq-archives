Oh, Furor won't leave; what other community feeds his ego so well?  Who else
rewards him for ranting obscentities?  Furor's blown up and left several
times in the past; this is just another 'look at me' stunt.  Reminds me of a
child, red-faced and screaming, sitting in the middle of a toy store with a
fire engine clutched to his chest.

Furor's a hell of a guildleader, and has some great ideas for the game (not
all of which I agree with, but nobody said I had to, either.)  But his
method of expressing himself and getting attention drops his credibility
with me to 'unreadable.'  Imagine how much more influence he'd have if he
could communicate...
