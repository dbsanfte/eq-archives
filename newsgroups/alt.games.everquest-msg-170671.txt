Time is money.

More, its possible to make money and exp at the same time.   If you'd spent
those 4 hours killing exp giving mobs, you might be 31 by now.  On the other
hand, you probably wouldn't have made nearly as much money.  On the other hand,
someone level 60 could easily make that much or more in the same 4 hours (say in
NG, where Lamentation dropped) while making decent exp.

It seems to make a lot more sense to pay for the silks than to spend time
farming them.  The price point depends on supply and demand, and the earning
potential that time represents for the people paying, not for those doing the
farming.

Someone level 20 could probably have farmed up almost as many silks as you did
in that same time.. but wouldn't expect to be paid any more or any less for what
they produced.
