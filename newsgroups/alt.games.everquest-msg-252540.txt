A contract was entered.  Person A agreed to pay person B to perform an 
action.  Person B performed said action after recieving confirmation that 
person A paid the funds.  Person A renegged, using a loophole in the 
payment system.

I don't believe that any competant lawyer would have any difficulty 
establishing that the action (handing over plat or items in EQ) has an 
established monetary value. Given that, I would expect that if the 
actions that occured are actually provable by a preponderance of the 
evidence, that person B could recover the agreed upon funds plus possibly 
(although unlikely in this case) additional costs, as well as possibly 
punitive damages.  The amount in question in this case likely falls under 
small claims, and, thus, punitive and court costs are likely not 
recoverable in this case, probably depends on the state in which the suit 
is filed.

While I do believe that fraud did occur in this case, I am not sure that 
a criminal conviction could be obtained due to the requirement to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt.
