"Because it's fun!"

  Most of what you do is fight the same mobs, in  the same places, over and
over again. You find this fun?

  "No, that's grinding."

  Grinding is not fun?

  "Not usually."

  Then why do you do it?

  "To make money. Get levels. Get stronger. Make mobs easier. It's an
investment."

  So you play a game to have fun, but it isn't fun until you have invested
hundreds
of irrecoverable hours of your life into it.

  "Well, yeah."

  And what do you do with your hard-won money and experience?

  "Gear up and take on harder mobs."

  Fighting hard mobs is fun?

  "Yeah!"

  So you spend most of your time doing something that will make the game
less fun.

  "No, make it *more* fun. It's easier to beat the mobs when you're
tougher."

  So which do you want to fight? Tough mobs or easy ones?

  "We want to make the tough ones easy."

  So the mobs you can xp against are too tough to start with? Can't you just
ask
SOE to make them easier?

  "Dude, you must be joking."

  Okay, forget I said anything...
