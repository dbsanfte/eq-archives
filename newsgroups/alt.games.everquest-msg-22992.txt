The way I make multiple line auction hotkeys is by using the /pause
command...this is a command only usable in hotkeys, and it's /pause #, where #
is the number of tenths of seconds (10=1 second)...I do this for a hotkey:
line 1- /auc WTS item, +1 stat 5 ac +3 stat
line 2- /pause 10
line 3- /auc WTS item, blah blah
line 4- /pause 10
line 5- /auc WTB item, blah blah

In my opinion, MUCH more convenient than having one long auction that you have
to keep shift-upping to get. I tend to be forgetful and lose mine, or go
linkdead, or whatnot. At any rate, I usually have lots of items to sell, and I
make a hotkey for every three (using the method I explained above)...I'm not
sure, but /pause 05 (half a second) may work, but 10 has always been fine for
me. I have a page just for auctions, with hotkeys titled "Auct1" "Auct2" etc.
Well, hope my tips helped. It's been my impression that not too many people
know about /pause and how to put multiple auction lines in a hotkey.
