Hi! I have only one character, a warrior, and have never played a caster
class..... So, last night I started a Bard, found the guild in Freeport,
passed my note in, trained a point or 2 in what seemed useful, (singing,
1hs, etc) and no, I don't know what to do! Do i buy my spells, or buy my
songs? I couldn't find a ability button for singing. ANy help or
directions to help appreciated. Muchos Gracias,

Jenda Warrior of the 18th Campaign, on Drinal
Daybreak Bard who can't even sing and would be a negative level is they
had one.
