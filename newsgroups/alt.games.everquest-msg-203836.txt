You (player) doesn't have to dispel the boiling blood. 
The chromodrac will do it for you.

I counted six times in one chromodrac fight that the mob landed
Boil Blood on me then conveniently dispelled it right away.
After he had stripped all of my beneficial buffs, of course.

This is the reason chromos are so hated: their dispel knocks off
a couple of buffs, and they cast it (and boil blood) constantly.
