My brother has a cable modem and a router, a lot of the time when he tries
to get on EQ it won't let him log on.  But he said he can try later and it's
fine, and it's not cause servers are down, I've been playing when he can't
get on.
He can't log on EQ but he can check e-mail and surf the net just fine.
What could be the problem(s)?  Could it be SoL, the router, modem, etc?
Thanks a head of time for any help on this.
