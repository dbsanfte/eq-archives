They were probably settled to avoid court costs.  American laws make it
difficult for the defendant to recover the cost of defending themselves in
courts; and judges are disinclined to issue frivelous lawsuit decisions.
This creates a subclass of lawyers who bring forth punative lawsuits against
companies that have no chance of winning in court, but cost the company
money to defend.

As much as I hate to admit it, this is one area where England does things
better.
