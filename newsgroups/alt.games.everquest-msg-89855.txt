While perhaps the "least interesting" in light of the other fun
discussions on this topic, that *is* one of the old "tried and true"
combos that you will rarely go wrong with. If you are careful in your
selection of zones and camping sites, the warrior/cleric combo can go
all the way to fifty with virtually no help. If you throw in a third
friend (and it could be rogue, wizard, monk, SK, *cough* Ranger
*cough*... most any damage dealer) the levels can fly by. Also, for
areas where p/u groups are possible, one of the best ways to start
(until the much higher levels) is to "/ooc Tank - Cleric looking for
more." You'll have a group faster than anyone (until, as said, higher
levels when "/ooc Chanter looking for more." will beat you. Heh.

Getting into a good, productive guild with that partnership is also a
breeze unless you're total assholes.
