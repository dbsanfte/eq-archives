This would be like playing 'The Sims' after staying awake for a 24 hour
marathon of "The Wall", but with nothing else meaningless to ponder ......
:-)

Okay ... taken from the perspective of the characters rather than the
players, nerfs like the Harmony nerf would be downright befuddling.  A given
part of your way of life was just changed by some higher being (okay ...
giving VI a lot of credit here), and you find yourself struggling to adapt.

Now ... if you were in a position such that you could develop or nerf
certain aspects of your RL existence, what would you do?  Examples:

- Broadband internet access no longer costs money but is an innate ability
of your dwelling.

- Every year you stay at your job you increase in skill (should be happening
anyway, right?).  After 5 years you can summon an intern to do part of your
work for you.  After 10 years you can train in management and can summon a
staff of up to 10 people to do your work for you.

Just an exercise to bide the time.  Looks like we may have plenty of time to
bide over the next few days. ;-)
