Heck, it's not clear he violated ettiquette.  The original poster said
they had a *full* *group* at the camp, and this *lone* goblin popped and
was running around the room, with the group chasing it to try to get it
to fight.  While they are running around, failing to engage the goblin,
the other guy engages it.

Generally, a camp is only recognized if the alleged campers can actually
handle it.  These noobs couldn't even figure out with six people how to
aggro one hostile mob. :-)  Doesn't sound like they were able to handle
the camp. :-)
