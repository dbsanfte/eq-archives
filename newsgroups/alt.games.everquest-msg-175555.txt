I'm proud to say that Reyder has *never* killed a live frog in the old
world.  It's been a while since I've been in Guk, so I forget whether I'm
Amiable or Kindly with them, but in either event they like me.  The undead,
of course, long since passed terminally KOS.

(You wouldn't believe the number of complaints I got from people because I
refused to heal them while they were fighting live frogs in Lower Guk.
Especially if the person died.  Very few would accept the {to them} lame
excuse of "it's against my class".)

I got my Ghoulbane 2 days after the quest for it arrived.
