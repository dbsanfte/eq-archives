Bash should make the target stop swinging and just stand there for a few
seconds.  This doesn't make a huge difference with a melee mob,
unless perhaps there are six of you bashing in sequence (there's a technique
I haven't heard used yet) the mob will still spend most of its time pounding
on you.  But once you start fighting caster mobs, it becomes a very
nice skill... wait till the mob starts casting, bash it successfully, and
your stun will interrupt its spell.  Since caster mobs don't normally
chain cast spells, your bash will probably be back up by the next
time it trys to slip one past you.

As a bonus, that 5 damage is free, bashing doesn't take any time
away from your normal melee.  Too bad you can't do it while
using a two hander, unlike a "large race" SK.
