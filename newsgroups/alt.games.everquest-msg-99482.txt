"Ummm........ good luck, I guess. Only played melees sub 35 and suddenly
at the controls of a 55 necromancer? That's the Norrath equivalent of
handing an Uzi to a chimp." - jazzmanian devil

Against all expectations... *coughs* ...he died and de-dinged back to 54
last night, but was pleasantly surprised to only lose half a blue. He didn't
look for a res even though there were high levels clerics in zone, thinking
that would be the quickest way to learn caution... "ouch - hurties".

I imagine it would have looked like a bad horror movie to anyone watching as
well: "don't split up and forgadsake don't walk backwards! Nooooo!!!". He
was in Dawnshroud Peaks poking his little dark elf nose around when he spots
a light blue Stone Grabber waiting in ambush in piece form. Thinking "hah -
you don't fool me" I looked around to make sure the coast was clear (one
Shroom at 8 O'clock) and sent in the Gimp....

"Yas Massa! Getting pounded for you Oh Great One. Would you like to test my
taunting ability with your wonderful overnuking again Massa?"

"Sure, why not!"

So, of course the StoneGrabber turns around to give a "Tsk, Tsk" slap and at
the same time the Sheild of the Magi wears off which caused as alarming drop
in the HP's. Backing up a few steps ( "No, not the walking backwards!!") the
single Shroom decides that now was a good time to let me know he had a few
mates hiding around him, one of which was now in aggro range dead on 6
O'clock.

"Ebayers like you have ruined your own lands, you won't ruin mine!!"
"Ebayers like you have ruined your own lands, you won't ruin mine!!"
"Ebayers like you have ruined your own lands, you won't ruin mine!!"
"Ebayers like you have ruined your own lands, you won't ruin mine!!"

*Loading. Please Wait....*

"Massa? Massa? Where are you O Great One.....?"
