I think that is not true. Because the limiting factor is the mana regen.
 If I can clear a camp by using all my mana and med back up completely I
could go slower and still be able to clear the camp. Though I won't have
time to take a break for the mobs will respawn as soon as the last one dies.

If the limiting factor is the mobs that are available then it would be
pointless to slow down your killspeed. That is easily noticable when you
notice your mana staying at around 95%. Then you clearly need to find
another camp imho.
