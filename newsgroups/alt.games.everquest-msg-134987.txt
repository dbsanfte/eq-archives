He seems to be part of the storyline for the addition of Jaggedpines and
the expansion of Gnoll Agressions towards Surefall and Qeynos. Doubtless
part of a quest, too, but I haven't seen anything on that yet.

Your chances are outstanding if you are smart about it. If you hang out
near Surefall and have a few plat hanging around you might just be able
to buy a port from a Druid straight to West Commons. If not, I'd say put
all your valuables in the bank and just try the run naked with a couple
of cheap weapons and a little food/water on you. Donating for a Sow or
two along the way would help immensely. 

Did you buy Luclin? If so, just make the run out into W. Karanas, turn
right, go down to the water and carefully follow the shoreline, watching
out for mobs and conning everything, until you zone into N. Karanas.
Shortly you will come to the wizzy spires. Hail the portal scion and get
a rock from her and wait for the spires to fire you up to the Nexus. Go
to the Faydwer portal and ride it down to GFay.  Then just run through
BB to the docks and take the boat to Freeport.

I first made that run with a naked monk back in the day shortly before
Velious came out. Trust me. It's a LOT easier now.

If you don't have Luclin yet, then you'll need to run the whole route,
but if you stick to zone walls, river edges, etc. and keep alert, you'll
make it. Just don't go through Kithcorre forrest at night and you'll be
fine.
