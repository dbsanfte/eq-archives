Other than the fact he mentioned his guild had raided for BoT keys and
he was the first on the list behind his officers? Hurry for reading
comprehension.

Besides you completely missed the point. He's L56, and he's making the
same mistakes that used to keep people from ever getting past L20.

He thought it was okay to loot anything that was sitting on the ground
for more than a minute.

Yep, perfectly normal behavior... for a L20 in Unrest seeing their
first piece of bronze. Today? Par for the course in the 50s.
