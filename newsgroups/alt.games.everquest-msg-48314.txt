Well, if the guild you want to join is not raid inclined, then don't
anticipate on going to Hate with them, as it is absolutely a raid zone.
Join them for all the other stuff, to be sure, but you'll probably have to
expect to go with other guilds for raid situations. Fortunately as a
cleric, this isn't all that difficult.

It is hard-coded into the game that any character below 46th level will be
completely incapable of entering any of the 5 planes in the game. These are
the only zones which have any form of level restriction to them (ignoring
vox and nagafen, who show anyone 53+ the door...I don't count them because
you can still enter the zones they reside in if you are 53+).

Yes. Probably one of the worst ways to do things. Causes all kinds of bad
blood when 2 groups show up at the same time to do the same mob/zone.

Most servers have some form of calender system where guilds and groups can
reserve major events like the Planes in advance, so that conflicts are
minimized. Ask some of  the higher level people on your server if they know
how/where to find information like that.
