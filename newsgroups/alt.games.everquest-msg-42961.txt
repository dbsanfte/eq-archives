    So any sport where you may have to sit on the sidelines for any length
of time is something you wouldn't pursue? Any sport where you have
practices? Any game with long, silent pauses while other players consider
their move, such as Chess and many tabletop wargames?

    Games have "downtime", some a lot (like EQ when soloing), some very
little (time opponent spends thinking in Cribbage when you aren't also
thinking). When I play a typical game that requires my opponent to think a
while (say, when I play Roborally), I leave the table and go to the
washroom, get a drink, watch the TV, quietly chat with others in the room. I
don't sit beside the board staring at the pieces hoping for them to take on
some greater meaning, as sitting around idle doesn't amuse me much. I
instead take the initiative of reducing the apparent downtime by doing
something else while the game is still in progress.

    Games also have "accounting" portions. I'd define this as when you're
doing an activity which requires minimal decision making or player
interaction, but which must be done. Examples would be counting your hand
for the other players in Cribbage, running from Kaladim to Felwithe at level
60 in EQ, or adding up total production points in your typical wargame. This
isn't terribly fun, but again, it must be done for the fun parts of the game
to occur.

    Now re-read my sentence that you've quoted. Does it make more sense now?
Do you really only play games with no downtime and no accounting?

    James
