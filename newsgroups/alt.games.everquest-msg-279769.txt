Depending on the server, I'd say both.

You can't be suggesting that a stagnant game is good for anybody.

Only if they comprise the majority.

Yet it's the weekend warriors who drive improvement and a better product 
which, in turn, attracts more customers.

That depends. We have laptops at work that are really stripped down 
basic budget models for those who need to check email and work on the 
occasional spreadsheet at home. Then we have those for the IT personnel 
and application developers that cost nearly twice as much. The vendor 
picks a market or tries to reach an acceptable compromise between them, 
as has SoE with EQ.

And drive product improvements.

1. They're not going to alienate the bulk of their player base (that 
which represents "the bulk" still being debatable)
2. The price will not go up much if at all in either case for a game 
that is on its way out, as you hypothesize

The thing is, there just aren't that many new players coming along 
anymore. Maybe the problem here is a difference in what we each consider 
casual and raiders. By your definition, I would likely be a casual, yet 
I strive to become a raider at some point, just not a heavy raider. I 
would guess that there are a lot of players out there who don't raid on 
a strict schedule, but raiding still comprises the majority of what they 
do.
