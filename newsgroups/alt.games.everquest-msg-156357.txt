Absolutely.

Not at all.

Think of it this way.   If they are on the hate list, then one of two things
is currently happening.   Either 1) the mob is beating on them, reducing
thier hit points and increasing thier downtime, or 2) they have expended
mana to control the mob in some way so that it does not hit them at the
moment, whether mezed or rooted or whatever, and using this mana increased
thier downtime.      If you come along and kill it after they spent HP /
Mana on it, you wasted thier effort, taking the exp and loot that they paid
for, in terms of downtime incurred. *

It can also be dangerous to interfere.   Each hit gives a mob a chance to
break root, and once they do the cleric that rooted them, healed 4 people
and is now low on hit points may be at the top of the hate list...
congrats, you just killed the other group's cleric.    And if you're hitting
a mezed mob, 9 out of 10 times its the other group's enchanter that will be
the initial target.


That being said, there are of course exceptions.   If someone cannot control
thier pull / kite / battle, and thier extra mob(s) come over to your group
and begin attacking, you certainly wouldn't be considered out of line for
defending yourself or your group members.   If you can let them take it
back, it would be polite and a "nice thing to do" (tm) but you're certainly
under no obligation to limit yourself to healing and tanking it while they
kill others then come back for it.


* - And don't bother telling me that the group you're discussing wasn't
incurring downtime.   It's the principle, not the actual fact of it that is
important.
