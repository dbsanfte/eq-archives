I'm suprised you do.  I notice no difference between membluring and not
membluring a mezed mob.

The only thing I've noticed is that it tend to wipe the most recent agro
first so it's totally counterproductive to use it during a fight.  I
remember tashing & slowing wurms in GD.  that would usually get me alot
of agro, and make it hard to get them off of me.  So I tried memblur. 
When membluring with agro, I noticed that I was beat on 3x as long... 
perhaps boggle will be nice when I get it.  I haven't had a mob go for
me in pop in ages after the tank taunting it breaks mez.  totally mem
bluring a target on average takes 3 casts, which is far too long to be
of any use.  Vs. root which has many many more situational uses, I'll
use root for that precious slot.

On the other hand if you start getting a lot of xtras I've heard it can
be fun to mez, pacify, mem blur - and watch them walk off after mez
breaks normally. - I've still got to try that.
