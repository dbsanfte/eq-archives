I have still NEVER seen a drop mission generating fewer of the quest
drops than were required to collect, and neither has anyone in my
guild claimed to see this happen. What I strongly suspect happens is a
turn was missed in the dungeon. I can't tell you how many times
hanging out after the mission I've heard the whole group saying "we've
killed everything, let's go" only to find we missed a whole section of
the dungeon. Sometimes even the group doesn't come across it, but I
know it was missed and they won't listen to me. ><
