Piggie back.

If you check the EQ graphic card compatibilities, you will find an
article entitled

[EverQuest] Latest Supported Video Devices and Driver Versions

In the Help/knowledge base.  On that page I did not observe your video
chipset mentioned.  Further, SOE does not support playing EQ or trouble
shooting laptops.  You will likely find that at best you will be able
to play eq with models turned down and lag very high. In the future it
would be in your best interest to do some basic research before buying
a new eq machine.  A wise idea would be to look for laptops(If you must
play on a laptop)  that include an NVIDIA GForce Go chipset or a Mobile
RADEON chipset.  while Not supported by Sony, they report much higher
success rates.

Also check the EQ forums at
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq?no_redir=true  Someone there may
have encountered and be able to help you with your problem.
