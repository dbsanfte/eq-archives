Torpor was around 80k last time I looked.

I started soloing PoN yardtrash at 57, without my epic, and found it 
difficult, but not due to resists, just due to mana drain.  51 shaman did 
ok in PoI.  Paladin did not have 90% rez yet, not high enough level for 
that, he is a 54 paladin.  We did have an enchanter though.
