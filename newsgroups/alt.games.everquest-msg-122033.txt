I think Necro/Shaman is a very good combination (but then again, Shaman goes
with most melee and pet classes). I have a 31 shaman which is teamed up with
my friends 29 necro and we usually don't have much trouble. Usually we start
by root/dot, and when root break the pet engage the mob. And if there are
adds we park the adds with root and takes them one at a time.

One of the few times we got in a little bit of trouble was with 2 treants in
SK, but none of us died (gate/fd is very helpful)
