I'm in the same position, although not to the same degree, as I only
have 2 chars.  I'm about to get my second char to 10, as she's about
to choose her priest path.  After that, however, her only xp will come
from completing collection quests that my main will supply.

My main supplies her crafting materials, and this is fine as she was
originally created to compliment my main's crafting (she was having
trouble getting a supply of quills and paper for app3s for my guild).
She's also responsible for decorating their apartments.    :)

So I'll have 1 main for adventuring, and eventually have 3 alts for
other crafting, hopefully trades that will compliment my alt - this is
a while away, though.

Don't forget you can always buy crafting materials via the PC boards,
as a lot of players are making a decent living from supplying
crafters.  This will help speed up the crafting.  Until you run out of
cash.       :)

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
