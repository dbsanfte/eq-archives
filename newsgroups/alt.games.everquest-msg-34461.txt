It is more of a punctuation rant then anything else. I'm a fine one to talk
since I am often challenged to make myself understood. The use of
paragraphs: A paragraph is used to  change sense or indicate a change in
sense. For instance:

Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy are dogs. I don't know why politicians are so
self indulgent.

Means something different from.

Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy are dogs.

I don't know why politicians are so self indulgent.

In the first case, it is up to the reader to realize why Ted Kennedy and
Bill Clinton are lumped together i.e. Were they both born millionares? No.
Are they both former presidents? No. Are they both womanizers? Maybe. The
politicians in this case refers to the set Kennedy and Clinton specifically
and you can infer the subset of politicians as yet to be identified with the
same specific behavior traits.

In the second example, because of the paragraph break, politicians and self
indulgent become global terms. Because of the change in context, indulgent
can refer to anything from over eating to boozing.

Best described as local vs global variable declarations if you want a
programming analogy.

Mildly interesting to me, just not that big a deal.
