Thought I'd add this:

Dueling in EC.  Im a 51 Barbarian champion and he was a 50 Troll
warrior.  We are down to 1 1/2 bubs and stop.  He asks me to hit him
one more time to bring him down lower so he can practice bind wound. 
I switch to the weighted axe, he turns his back on me and I swing.

Zowar lands a cripping blow 512 DMG
Zowar hits Troll for 212.
You have killed a troll.

Poor guy, had to get him rezed.
