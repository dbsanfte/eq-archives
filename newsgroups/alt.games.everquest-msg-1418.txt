Whenever it comes to getting lots of cash, I have seen 2 approaches that
work: Camping mobs that drop lots of loot and camping mobs that drop good
GEAR.  I assure you the second approach is more profitable; however, you do
have to spend the time to auction off the newly-acquired goodies.

Download maps of dungeons like Uguk, solA, perma, and Najena.  Then camp
those spawns.  A 30ish char with the right tools can make them a great cash
cow.

Cheers,

-Grim.
