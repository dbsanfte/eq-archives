My my my such anger, tisk tisk.
First it would only be an exploit at some very low levels cause I dont
know what you are hunting but my prey can kill in about 15-30 seconds
or less once they start hitting me. Now I may have a few seconds
before that happens but pulling the plug myself would be too risky.
Second my ego would not allow me to do so untill it was too late
anyway. I NEVER die unless I go LD. Sorry you cant seem to say the
same. 
But thanks for clearing up the issue of who we have to thank for such
nonsense.
As for the HG issue, perhaps a bad example, wont go into the sore spot
of non-xp killing.
