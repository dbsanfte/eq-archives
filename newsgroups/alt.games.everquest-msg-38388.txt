If that is the case, then how do you account for slower speed when
encumbered?  Your agi is lowered by being encumbered.  Cash out 100pp worth
of copper, and neither of your dwarves will be able to move at all, and the
lower agi is the only stat which changes, and therefore accounts for the
lower (or in this case zero) rate of movement.
