knobjockey".

Comprehende?

Who are all crammed within 10% of content ~ resource efficient isn't it?

Let me please be the first person to suggest that the next time you notice
something unpleasant in reality, like, for instance, the fact you are a
knobjockey, that you follow the same advise and blow your fucking brain

Err, it says to me that that there must be at least 3 working neurones in my
head which is more than I would have estimated beforehand.
