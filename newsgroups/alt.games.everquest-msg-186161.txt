    Brell's Stalwart Shield: 330 HPs.
    Kazad's Mark: 910 HPs.
    Focus of the Seventh: 544 HPs.
    Blessing of the Nine: 618 HPs.

    10000-330-910-544-618=7598 HPs unbuffed.

    As per the HP-ordered rankings at EQRankings (
http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&class=&css=&order=HP ):

    TWO warriors in all of Everquest are over the 10 K mark when buffed. One
is Furor, and the other profile looks to be faked (even the biggest DKP
whore guilds wouldn't have two rogue-usable piercers of that quality on a
warrior). So, in all of Everquest ONE person is over 10 K HPs when fully
buffed for HPs.

    A far cry from "not that hard". ;-)
