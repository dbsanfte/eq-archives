I would just like to take a moment and upgrade my initial score. I have
to give "Connie" a perfect 6.0 on the troll scale. Popping in and
"innocently" tossing out what has served to become the best flame bait
in a.g.e. for the year 2002 to date. Hundreds of posts, frothing at the
mouth, with no end in sight.

Well done, "Connie".
