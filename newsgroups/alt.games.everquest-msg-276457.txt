I assume you haven't reached the highest levels of the tradeskills in
WoW then?

Almost all of the recipes over 250 or 255 for each manufacturing
tradeskill are drops, not trained.  Also, at 250, I believe all the
manufacturing tradeskills split into specialties, which require small
quests to begin in, and you can't go back without deleting the
tradeskill and starting over again.  There are still some generic
recipes above 250, but not as common as before.

As a Leatherworker, I have definitely noticed a huge difference in my
progress over 200.  It took a while before I was able to find a recipe
that was orange (= guaranteed skillup) between 250 and 260 that wasn't
a Dragonscale one (which requires about 30 rare worn dragonscales and
40 thick leather), and I was having horrible luck with the yellow
recipes.  As a hunter, the only Dragonscale I'd want is the Black
Dragonscale which adds to attack power...but no Agility.  So I'm not
even sure if I want it at all...but it's a moot point since I haven't
seen the recipes at all, or fought mobs which drop black dragonscales!

Tradeskills go up very fast at low levels, for sure, but then again, so
do your actual levels.  It's not unusual to be making items that you
can't use yet, but for me it's never been more than 3 or 4 levels.  And
it eventually starts to get expensive to learn the next highest rank of
recipes...I think to advance past 225 skill you need to pay 5 gold,
even for gathering skills.  So there are some built-in delays for those
who aren't twinks.

Basically, I'd say that anyone can become an expert in a tradeskill
through normal gameplay, but not everyone will have the inclination to
become a master of their respective tradeskills.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
