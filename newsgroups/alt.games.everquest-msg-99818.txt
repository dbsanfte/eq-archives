If you're summoning them for someone under level 20, who's probably never
dealt with no-rent stuff, I'd say it's a good idea.  If you're summoning it
for a level 55 on a planes corpse run, it should go without saying.

OTOH, it's good form to give that information.  Back when my revive was no
xp, I'd always warn the recipient.  Now that it's 35%, I still think it's a
good idea, but it seems less urgent.  Of course, I also think that those who
even know a Paladin can revive also know the limitations on it.

That's always a possiblity.  If I was, say, level 20, and asked for a port
to WC, and wound up in Lavastorm, I'd be a tad miffed, since I probably
wouldn't survive the run through Nek.  Even with soloing, though, I would
expect that level of knowledge.  Maybe they should have a written exam at
every level.  Essay question, to be graded by a GM or Guide.  If you fail,
you get an upgrade, and are stripped of your level until you complete it,
and pass a re-test.

Again, I think being able to tell what the different classes are should be
trivial at ten and above.  If I see a half elf in plate, and dual wielding,
I may not be able to tell if he's a bard or a warrior, but I know I probably
shouldn't ask him for a SoW.  I knew this back at level 15, as well.  I may
be the only one with curiosity, though.
