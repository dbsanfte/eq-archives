Has anything new about the RP server been mentioned in the last couple of
weeks?  I was  wondering and actually looking forward to it.

I am looking forward to it for one big reason alone.  I am very new to the
game.  I have one character and he is a level 5 bard.  He is not twinked.  I
bought or found everything that I have on me.  Heck, I didn't even know what
twinking was and that is a big disadvantage to me.  I see people of lower
level than me wearing full suits of armor.  I have wrist bands. and I carry
a rusty long sword.  It isn't fair.  so with the new server, only having one
character and no account transfers means everyone has to start from scratch
and it will even out the playing field at least for a while.
