I'm not the one who mentioned North Korea in this thread. That's who
I was replying about.

Peope have been jailed in a democracy without being charged with
breaking a law. If you don't want to believe it, I don't care.

Historical fact proves such claims wrong. If you don't know about
it, then your history education left it out. If you don't want to
believe it, thats okay. Go on with your life. Live in what ever
world you want to live in.

I said one thing. Nothing else. If you want to add on to what I
said, at least don't pretend it was me that claimed or implied it.

I did say it, repeatedly.

I'll say it one last time.

If, note the qualifier if you can, he was making a valid complaint
they were not justified in banning him. They should spend some
cooling off time in jail, say over night, and then make a non-heated
decision. Think of it as a time out.

If, ooh look another qualifier, he ranted, raved, and posted
obscenities, they were justified and no jail time is needed. No time
out, no 'you have been naughty get over it' time out.

If that isn't clear, I don't care. If you want to keep claiming I
really meant sometihing else, then go ahead and do so. But any claim
I implied something is false.
