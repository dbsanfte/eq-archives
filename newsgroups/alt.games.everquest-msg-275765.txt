Um, what game have you been playing?

My shaman has soloed for probably 70% of his career, and has had zero 
problems from level 1 to level 70.  The flagging is certainly harder now 
than it used to be, but, is completely unnecessary for soloing.  
Personally, if I was going to start from level 1, I'd go with a 
necromancer, if I knew I was going to be soloing most or all of it.
