FWIW, my wife did the Woe & Envy thing last weekend in preparation for
a tear MQ. She had done everything except Neh'Ashiir and Rak'Ashiir
and was at ally (not max ally) faction at that point. I believe it 
took nine woe/envy cycles to reach max ally. She was not doing the
gem turn-in in EJ each cycle though; that might have sped it up.
