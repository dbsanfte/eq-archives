All I can say is that it seems to have helped. Maybe its in my mind,
or just the fact that he just hit 55 *shrugs*. Since hes an alt - he
didnt have the best equipment and am still trying to hit that 200 mark

GoK is less resisted to begin with than say Dazzle, but even GoK seems
to be less resisted since I upgraded. Its one of those things that you
cant parse and cant really come up with hard data.
