Any time that forage button clears use it.....have it on a hotkey and
there to use. It took a long time to increase my skill to a sensible level
BUT as a wandering ranger moving from EFP to BB I fund the boat trips were
very useful in low level play to boost sense heading, track, forage sneak
etc etc etc to levels that were acceptable. By the time I hit level 10 as
a ranger my forage was sufficient to mean that if kept in permanent use I
simply did not need to buy food, backed up by fishing I gained a
surplus...my forage is now somewhere near 130 and basically if I am ever
near out of food I simply need to wander aimlessly for 15 mins or so and
Im OK again. Its also a convenient place to start developing my brewing
skill....now that different foods have different lasting times. COnverting
pods of water to flasks (4 pods, one bottle) followed by flasks and 2 of
beries or fruit (gives 5 fruit juice...which unlike the berries can be
sold if you wish) expands your range of food and rink items, ups the ol
brewing skill (and roots and veggies can be used later for further
increases). Some of these things are in demand and it gets the skill high
enough that making Heady Kiola for tailoring is fairly easy to get to.
