Right now, you're reminding me of the warrior who shouted for another
healer to the back wall in velketor. I was told he *needed* a cleric,
and that he already had a shaman and a bard in group, in a spot where
I often have been the only healer with up to 5 melees or preferably 4
melees and a bard/ench. He spent an hour shouting for that cleric
before his group broke up and left, upon which the group I was in took
over the spot.

Gotta love the healer=cleric mentality.
