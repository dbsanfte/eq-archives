Your offer is unacceptable.  You have no authority to issue karma and
the suggestion as stands will make the game less enjoyable.  Remember
that the power wizards have to port for profit (and to be one that has
greater travel freedom than the common warrior) IS a part of the game
balance.  To prevent imbalance you must give wizards something
worthwhile to offset what you want to take away.  Now if you were to
offer to make us the MASTERS OF DAMAGE OUTPUT AT HIGH LEVELS, then we
may be willing to give up ports.
