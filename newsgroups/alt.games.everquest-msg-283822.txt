Clerics got a healing bonus thrown in a while back, sometime around
GoD or a little before.  Back when people wondered why you needed a
cleric since a shaman could do the job just as well plus all the other
bonus features.  Then GoD came out and all the hybrids took it in the
shorts.

Anyway.....clerics do indeed have a bonus to heals that no other class
has.  I don't know the percentage but what you parsed feels accurate.
