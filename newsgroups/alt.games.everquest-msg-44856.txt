I saw my first ones after the raid was over in Naggy's lair last night.
I didn't see (or at least notice) any during set-up, buffing, or the
fight itself. Then, when the dragon was dead and we were rezzing and
gathering for the loot rolls, I started seeing bunches of squares and
eights scrolling by. Doesn't confirm that it's because of bind wound,
but I wouldn't rule it out. We had a fair number of clerics and other
heal capable types, but that doesn't mean some of the monks and warriors
weren't bandaging anyway rather than waiting for a healer.
  As to LD's, we had quite a few too, but with about 40 people, I didn't
think six or seven was *that* unusual. Didn't connect it to the patch in
my mind, anyway.
