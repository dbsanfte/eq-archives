Why yes. 

Some of my ancestors got transported, they hadn't broken any laws
either. That has nothing to do with this situation though. I brought
the fact up that people have been put in jail even though they broke
no laws because some people have this bizzare notion that
democracies wont do such a thing.

Nope.

I am saying, that if the guy was only making a valid complaint, they
were dumb to ban him.

Then I said they should cool down in jail over night.

But if he did act out by screaming, etc. then I have no problem with
what they did.

Nope.

Bureacratic nonsense is what we all have to deal with, but I don't
have to like it.

I do think its strange that so many thought nobody had ever been put
in jail when no laws had been broken. That they have no knowledge of
such events is astounding.
