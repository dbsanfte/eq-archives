I got my necro up to level 10 last night. :)  Now I want to go out and
explore.  I've done the Orc Camps, Oasis, SK route with a different
character and felt like doing something a little different this time. 
I've looked on EQAtlas, and it lists a bunch of zones that work with my
level, but I'm not sure where to go.  I was kinda wondering, what zones
suit a necro's strengths?  And what are the different fighting
strategy's for the different zones?

I was thinking a dungeon might be fun.  But I've read several places,
that having a pet in a dungeon is a bad idea.  (They must pee on the
carpet or something ;))  I think the Warrens is probably a bad idea. 
(Lets see how many Kobolds I can aggro on one pet!)  CB is out, if I
ever want to go back to Neriak.  Hmmm...I might have just ruled all the
level appropriate dungeons out.

I think I want to solo, I'm still learning on the ins and outs of doing
so.  But a group could be cool, to break the monotony occasionally.  I
guess I'm looking for a Super Zone!  Which I know doesn't exist.  But
what zones are there that are good for a level 10 DE necro?
