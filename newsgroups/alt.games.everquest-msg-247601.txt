Hmmm... *if* SOE did any useful testing before release, and had a room 
of such rigs where changes had to pass, it would be darn nice of them to 
publish the *exact specs* of each.

Then, people who pretty much only play EQ can buy and configure an exact 
copy of one of these things, and rest assured that EQ has actually been 
tested to work on it...

Of course they won't do it, because someone would immediately build one, 
and promptly crash in the PoK, with a cone of sparkles around his head, 
while falling through the world, after getting stuck in a tree which he 
didn't see because the textures on it were invisible from the outside.

And thus any illusion that that the changes have to actually pass in the 
room-of-rigs before changes go live would be promptly dispelled.
