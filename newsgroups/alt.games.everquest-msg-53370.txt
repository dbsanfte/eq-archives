No, we wouldn't. 
When we start, we are NOT trained to be adventurers. Until the day we
commit to a guild, we are only children in a protected environment
with aptitudes for different kinds of magics and melee combat. Our
training starts as we login and hand in our guild note, and even then
we only learn how to use weapons and magic. Only the classes and races
that are expected to be roughing it get to learn foraging, and sense
heading is something we have to pick up on our own as we travel.  Our
training prepares us for a career at home, and if the game didn't make
us go out and explore, we'd probably end up as town guards and guild
trainers. The school of life is a very large factor in EQ.
We could also be compared to soldiers; do you think every soldier that
ever existed has known his bearings at any time and been able to
scrounge up a meal in the middle of an unfamiliar forest?
