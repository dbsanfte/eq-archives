This is just stupid. Why would Verant do this? If it were easy (for a
high level guild, of course) to kill this guy after doing all the
work, I could understand. But where this guy is an insane encounter
even WITH the Seru Bane weaps, this is just a pointless time sink that
doesn't reward anyone for the effort of making the weapons any more so
than taking down some other non-invulnerable uber-mob or going on an
NToV/VP/PoM/PoG raid.

First, Luclin was a mess when released.

Then they delayed the Bazaar and the new UI for over 6 months.

They continue to hose everything in site with each patch.

Downtime is never as short as advertised.

Prices have gone up.

New trade skills are painful beyond belief (though I do think they're
the bright spot in all of this even so).

Luclin is still slow frame-rate wise.

No, I've had enough. I game occasionally with a low-level group and
will maintain one or two characters for that purpose, but I'm done
telling friends to try the game only to have them chew me out about
the problems. I'm done trying to organize in-game events only to have
them be nearly impossible due to server problems and the lack of
communication that runs rampant in the game. I'm just done.
