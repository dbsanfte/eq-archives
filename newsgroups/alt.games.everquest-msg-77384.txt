I'm excited about the wizard class AA's. There's some skills in there
that could potentially make wizards the masters of PvP. I can't wait
to bust a strong root on a lvl 60 warrior, and then activate mana burn
for massive unresistable damage.

I also think the rogue AA escape is pretty cool. Instantly make all
mobs forget about you. Very roguely.

Also the ranger ones for increasing bow damage could get really ill
when combined with their trueshot discipline.

The holy/unholy steed for the knight classes sounds neat too.

I guess I like the activatable AA's most, because they offer more
tactical variety to the game.
