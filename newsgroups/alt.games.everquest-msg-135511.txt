I've been using the viewport command to try and reduce lag in the bazaar
a bit as well.

I run in 1024x768 - and I use /viewport 312 100 400 300 to make a small box
in the middle of the screen.  /viewport reset to go back.  When I really
get it down, I'll have it more to the left so the bazaar window can be open 
and not overlap, and I'll hotkey it  (wish I could hotkey the clip plane)
