You make some interesting points, but you're assuming the curve

the case.

It's just too hard to say if 1-10 is perfect the way it is, or
should be a little easier, or should be a little harder.

My experience suggests it should be a little easier, but of
course, that's hardly scientific -- just my impression.  :)

I disagree!  But that's another discussion entirely.

Perhaps this is often true but it's not an inevitable result!

Very well said.
