I always thought the Picts were a dark haired group of people that were
driven into the North East of Scotland by the Gaels. I suppose the two
definitions are not mutually exclusive, just  never considered them to be
merely Celts by another name.

Robbie the Pict from Inverness will be so disappointed (now his legal name,
in an effort to avoid paying tax, iirc).

One glaring thing that separates the Barbarians from Scots, is that the
Barbs are huge tall people, and the Scots are uniformly short arsed! Go to
Glasgow, and feel like a giant!...just before you get glassed :)
