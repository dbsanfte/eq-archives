I tried Crystal Caverns, after a looong CR decided I didn't care for
especially not having Invis as a cleric I almost died going through the
camp on the surface just to get there, Had to DA to get through
everything, and got knocked down to a bubble of health along the last
10'.  The XP was tolerable for the 5 or so mobs before I got a pull of 3
and died, but the mobs hit too hard.

I tried Tower of Frozen Shadow, since it was listed as having all
undead, good for a cleric I thought.  I had a hell of a time getting in
there as well, but did it after about 2 hours of getting the hang of
it.  The mobs in there are WAAAAAAAAY underconned, I didn't even manage
to kill one the time I was able to pull one after 3 times of zoning out
almost dead with like 5 on me, so I left. - I really do not recommend
this zone!

I tried Split Paw, got 31 there so far, figure I'll say for another
level, if I don't go back to MM.  XP is good, but the loot sucks, all
the stuff that drops might have been worth something when they first
changed it from the lower lv. zone it used to be, but it's pretty
worthless these days, and they don't drop much in the way of cash.  I
had a much harder time getting a group there, and I also noticed a lv
60+ or two farmig stuff there.  I don't know what for, although I assume
the one assasin was there for poison ingredients.  I also ran into a
Nech Mal or something a couple times that was impossible for me to solo,
since he kept healing himself, I tried stunning, but either they are too
tough, or I just don't have the hang of it yet.  Ran out of mana from
full alternating stun/nuke, and occasionally healing since he was
wrathing me back.  The Lechse Mal or whatever are 

I'm thinking I might be better off back in MM just for the better loot. 
I think the XP was similar when they were blues and light blues, but the
greens really slow me down.  

I doubt I'll get to play at all until after chrismas some time, and the
cleric is starting to wear on me with the lack of groups, so I might go
play something else for awhile...
