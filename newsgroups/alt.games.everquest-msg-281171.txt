I understand where you are coming from as most of us become MMORPG
Nomads (mainly after EQ2 was released).  I think the bottom line with
all these games is just getting into a good guild that accomplishes
what you want to accomplish.  That is what will continue to make any
game you play fun.   

Unless you want to solo consistently and still get good exp(and WoW
seems the best for that so far), it is imperative that you get into a
large guild.   That's pretty much the bottom line.   You can't go
wrong and there is always something to do and someone to group with.
