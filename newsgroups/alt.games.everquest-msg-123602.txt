Aye, was a dupe bug.  Something about picking up
and dropping coins really fast would get the server
and client confused about how much you had and
it would eventually dupe.

Here's another one, if you've got some cash....
serious cash.

Transfer 80kpp from one character to another.
Be it another account or getting it from a vendor
(via selling large bag of platinum)...within 30
seconds you'll go LD while the server shuts
you down to decide whether you've aquired 80kpp
from a legit trade or from a dupe bug.

It happens 100% of the time, anything over
around 60kpp or so.
