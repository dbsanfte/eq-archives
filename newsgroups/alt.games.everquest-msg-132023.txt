for huge pull ae-groups (like the old 55mob acrylia pulls)

3 enchanters
1 cleric
2 epic wizards (to pull)

You don't mez early waves, you stun them.  Basically pull as many as you can
without dieing, get them to the enchanters who ae-stun, and pack them into a
tight bunch.

Re-cast your epic (and get healed) and go get another 5-10 mobs, rinse and
repeat.   In Acrylia we had 2 wizards doing the pulling (me and 1 other)

Once there is sufficient mobs (its the same mana to kill 25 mobs as it is to
kill 50mobs, so make sure your being effective with your pulls) and once
they are all packed tightly (pb ae isnt a huge radius) let rip with your
jyll's line of spells.

Mobs are perma stunned, so even clerics unleash their PB Ae's.  In 1minute
or so, you just killed ~55 mobs.

For places like Sebilis, Chardok, 2 enchanters are fine.  Add in another
wizard, druid or magician.

I've also been the puller for an AE group on my monk,   me, 1 cleric, 2
enchanters, 2 wizards.   Same deal, just  I do the pulls instead of the
wizards.

Important things about AE groups.. never even bother trying with less than 2
enchanters.  1 enchanter will NOT cut it
