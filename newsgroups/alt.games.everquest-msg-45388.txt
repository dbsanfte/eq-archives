Get a hub.That's the only way ICS is supported. It will work with a
crossover cable, but not reliably and it's an unsupported
configuration. Try this experiment: disconnect the cable modem from
your computer and plug it directly into your friend's PC. Match the IP
address and settings to your own computer's, and see if it will work.
I bet it will. A decent 4 port hub will set you back $30.
