  When I first started playing, my friends told me to keep the far clip
plane
at 0% to keep from frreezing up in PoK and the Bazaar. It was months
before I was reminded of it, and discovered the beauty I had been missing.

  Most of Luclin:

  DSP, espescially looking out from the ME entrance, with the shadows
under the trees distinguishable from the sunlit areas.

  Sanctus Seru, actually liiking like it's daytime, and not underground.

  Marus Seru, with all those mobs out htere for the taking.

  Mons Letalis, with its majestic peaks, meandering dry riverbeds, and that
one sphere that leads to the zone out to MS; a crashed planetoid?

  (And how do you get to the top of the Spire?)

  The Scarlet Desert, looking like a part of Mars.

  The Twilight Sea, looking like a tropical sunset.

  Katta Castellum, with its gothic-castle aspect.

  Grimling Forest, a classic fungi forest scene. I feel like a smurf walking
through there.

  Much of Kunark, too:

  The statue of Firiona Vie and the ship that takes you to Antonica.

  The Feild of Bone, looking alon the wall south toward Kaesora, and along
the
bone pit toward Kurn's.

  The Overthere, looking down into the canyon. Couldn't resist doing an
Evel Kneivel over it. And looking toward the SF ramp.

  Frontier Mountains, best seen from the air, with all those monuments from
the
Great Iksah Empah.

  LOIO, the windmill.

  Dreadlands, skywalking in wolf form to Karnor's.

  The river through the Great Divide, day or night.

  The waterfall in Stonebrunt.

  The Indiana Jones feel of the Mines of Nurga.

  The winter wonderland feel of Crystal Caverns.

  The dragon spine bridge to IC.

  Flying over the Burning Woods, seeing the impact craters.

  Dagnor's Cauldron and Lavastorm, with their poking shards of rock.

  And I haven't even been on any PoP raids yet... haven't seen any gods but
CT.

  Aaaaagghhhh...my system dosen't take screenshots! I was told where to find
the saved images, but they aren't there. Nothing named anything like
EQ00000.bmp
or .jpg or .png or .tga or anything is anywhere on my hard drive. Does
Windows XP
just not like the game? Anyone else on a WinXP system have this problem? Any
way I can change my default screenshot directory?
