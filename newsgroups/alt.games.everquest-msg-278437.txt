A response from a slightly different viewpoint than the norm.

After running guilds for 6 years, I packed it in as there were just too many
guilds competing for a smaller number of potential applicants, and the
number of potential applicants willing to commit to a 70% attendance ratio
was shrinking even faster.  I was the last of the "old school" leaders that
I'm aware of, and my style of leading may truly belong to days gone by.  I'm
somewhat proud of the influence I had in that time, though, as I believe
every raiding guild (from the Rodcet Nife side of the now merged server) has
some portion of their leadership and a fair portion of members who were
previously under my command.  I can confidently say that I led more people
into battle over the years than currently make residence on the after-merge
server.

I applied to a guild for the first time ever.  Figured I should experience
the other side of the game at least once.  It's freakin hard to take a
backseat when you've been the driver for so long.  The urge to take command
when things aren't "moving" is almost overpowering.

I get asked almost daily to start a new guild, which is flattering and a
*completely* unnecessary ego boost as anyone who has ever conversed with me
is aware.  =) If I could harvest the remaining "hardcore" players from all
the raiding guilds to form it, I probably would.  As that is about as likely
as me getting a date with Kirsten Dunst (I've become a dirty old man...  I
was already married when she was in the vampire movie), I'll give the whole
"member" thing a solid go and see where it leads.

If I want to play low levels, I load up Guild Wars.  =)
