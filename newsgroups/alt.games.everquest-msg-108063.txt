If you play at odd times like me then RunneyEye Level 4 is a good spot to
farm if you are the only person in that zone (just leave if anyone above 15
turns up). Nothing in there comes close to worrying the 49 pet, just make
sure you keep summon companion up for when he goes walkabout.

There are no uber items there but some decent items for a 30 (not so much
40)like the following:

Blackened Alloy Girdle
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6024

Blackened Iron Medallion
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6020

Blackened Alloy Coif http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6029

And zip upstairs to level 3 every now and again when the 4th floor is
emptied to check to see if the Sporali Mouldmaster is up as he drops a basic
haste gloves (13 percent?).

Also, a complete set of Blackened Alloy armour with BALS and BABS makes a
great gift to any mellee class or Shaman (BA is <all> size) newbie alts. Not
too much armour for them to fall behind in defence skill but enough
protection to keep a chain class happy till quest armour stage and a plate
class not so exposed as they gradually peice together their first plate set.
Besides, BA looks decent in a full set.

The BABS (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6026) is still a
good 2 hander even by Luclin standards. The BALS
(http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6042) hasn't held up so
well but still isn't that shabby yet. Both these are lore and reasy to
acquire so spread 'em round. No use holding onto them or other ones you find
will rot.
