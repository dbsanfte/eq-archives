Grow a brain. Not quoting is bad. Overquoting is bad. All things in
moderation, grasshopper. If you weren't such a fucking moron, you
wouldn't have to have had such things explained to you in the first
place. Anyone with more intelligence than a bowl of tapioca pudding
can figure out how to judge what's over-quoting and trim quotes
appropriately. 100+ quoted lines to add a 3 line response is OBVIOUSLY
too much.
