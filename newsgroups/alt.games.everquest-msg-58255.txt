One more point about the hate list and Rogues which many may or may not be
aware of.

The rogues successful Rogue evade lowers the rogue in the hate list a set
amount. (I seem to remember a verant post saying 250-500 points, but I'm not
sure they said exactly)  The old rogue evade (pre-fix or pre-nerf) lowered
the rogue to the bottom of the hate list, even below casters/healers.  This
was great for the rogue but very bad for the casters/healers. IMHO, the new
Evade is fine.  I could stand to see a few more success messages but on the
whole, I can deal with a few misses by dissengaging the MOB as required.

So... as the rogue's evades are cumulative, I would *guess* the taunts are
too and not just "raises your hate to the top".  If that where true, then
the warrior would taunt, get argo back, and then promptly lose it again when
the rogue/monk/wizzard did more immediate damage.

So...as I see it...

The warrior builds hate DoT style melee'ing the MOB and builds hate DD style
by taunting.

The rogue builds hate DoT style by melee'ing the MOB as well as building it
DD style ( Backstabbing), and then attempts to remove hate negative DD style
( EVADE).

When the two get good balance and successes, it works as planned.
