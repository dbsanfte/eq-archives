1) How is that advantage any different based on its source? If the equipment
is the same and it was given to characters of the same level, how does that
advantage shift based on the source? Does the advantage cease to exist based
on its source, or are you simply throwing out a moral argument?

2) How, exactly, is having equipment higher than your level an unfair
advantage? To whom is it unfair? The computer controlled monsters? Who is
being put at a disadvantage because you have equipment higher than your
level? And how is that disadvantage negated if your equipment came from
someone else, not your own character?

Pray tell, what rules are being raped?
