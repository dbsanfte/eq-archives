My advice is to wait until at least level 5 or 6 before starting to group;
that gives you time to learn how the game works, how to play your character,
etc.  You want to have some idea what _you're_ doing before you start having
to keep track of what other people are doing too.  :-)

Until level 10 or so, just about everybody melees some even in a group,
although your main priority should be using your spells.

Your Minor Healing spell is actually quite useful on other characters around
your level.  And, as a druid, don't think of yourself as only being useful
for your healing spells: you also get other very useful spells at low
levels, such as Snare and Harmony.
