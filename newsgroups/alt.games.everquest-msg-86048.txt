Nope.  I had my bike stolen once.  I had it properly parked and
locked.  I accept no responsibility at all for that theft.  They came
along and hammered a screwdriver down through the ignition system.

I really wish I'd found that SOB while he was riding around on my
bike.

In regard to your argument concerning "assuming it's safe", no, that
doesn't apply either.  I do not assume my vehicles are safe, simply
because they're locked.  But that also confers no responsibility upon
me for someone else's commiting theft.

It is *absolutely* impossible to lock a vehicle away sufficiently that
nobody can get at it, especially if it's a vehicle that you use every
day.

My responsibility is to lock my vehicle and take whatever other
reasonable precautions there are.  That's where it begins and it ends.
If someone steals my vehicle, even if I left it unlocked, I am not
responsible for it's theft; they are.  At no time did I suggest,
recommend, cajole, order, or demand that they steal my vehicle; they
did it of their own volition.

If someone breaks into my home, I accept no responsibility for his
breaking in.  I may accept some for his death, but that's a separate
matter.
