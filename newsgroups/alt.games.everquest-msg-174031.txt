Giggling maniacally and surrounded by armed hamsters,
dday@houston.rr.com (Dan Day) (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

What? You're back? I thought you had some propoganda to distribute....

Such a bold comment for something with absolutely no backing
whatsoever.

Wake up, sunshine. The original guys held back despite having a
glorious casus belli against a dictator who tried to gobble up another
state. The clowns running the show now have *no* casus belli and are
willing to go much further.

You do the math.

I didn't say anything of the sort. I pointed out that the original
statement did not support the original argument. Keep up.

If we needed any further proof of your ignorance, here it is.

Please. Go educate yourself on what he is allowed to do with that oil
currently before you open your mouth again.

Because things aren't the same this time? Or did Iraq invade Kuwait
while we were playing EQ?

Take off the propoganda colored glasses and follow the money.

You'd go start a war without cause and keep terrorism going strong.
You didn't know that?

You didn't get it straight, but that's okay; reading comprehension
comes with education.

The US wants to control the oil. By doing so they control its export,
influence its prices, and can use it instead of their own reserves as
much as possible.

It's not like they don't do this elsewhere. A little behind the times
again, are we? Or just believing the propoganda again?

Tripe snipped...

Don't be silly. I know for a fact what they think what they are doing
is absolutely right. It just so happens that a few influences on their
thinking have made them impervious to alternate solutions. It's these
influences that are wrong. But what can you do? Lobby groups rule the
US, and these groups *only* care about themselves.

When you substitute thinking for yourself for parroting the party
line, that's what happens. How much do you pay the Republican coffers
a year, I wonder, mr oil man?
