The WoW beta is available to those who have been invited.  Several
Everquest high end guilds seem to have been invited pretty much en
masse.  Afterlife and FoH, I guess, I know much of Defiant (of Vallon
Zek) is now mostly in WoW.  I don't think that many have cancelled
their accounts yet, though - there is not yet a high end game in WoW
(as of last week anyway) and it's fairly easy to blast up to the max
level.

This must be rather worrying to SOE, if a lot of high end players are
going from a not-yet-beaten high end game in EQ to a beta of a game
that doesn't even a high end.  I don't know how much that happened in
DAoC beta, but I don't think they did the same mass invitation of high
end Everquest players.

Most of this post is pure speculation.
