  That may be true, but I don't plan on using this computer anymore in
a month, I'll be passing it along to a family member.  I didn't buy
Windows 2000 or XP mainly because I think my computer would choke on
it.  It's only a Pentium II 350 w/ 256 mb of memory.  Plus Windows
2000 would run closer to $135 for an OEM copy--which I believe would
require a hardware purchase on top of that.  Windows XP might be found
for a bit cheaper but I'd have to do costly and time consuming system
upgrades just to meet the recommended requirements.
