Think about it this way: In a generic event with multiple 'random' 
branches. If your guild can't cope with the various things that can 
happen in an encounter. Its not dumb luck that you lose, its dumb luck 
if you WIN. Your guild hasn't learned enough to win consistently, your 
strategy is inadequate to cover the possible outcomes. You ability to 
react and execute tactics based on what the mob is doing isn't where it 
needs to be.

Once you can take the mob down no matter which way he goes, you've 
mastered him. Until then the odd win is dumb luck.

You want to run an encouter like a machine once you've mastered it, 
every stage mapped out, planned out, and you expect the mob to comply by 
moving exactly the same way every time with no variation.

That is how bosses in side scrolling 1980's shooters behave. It 
shouldn't be how bosses in state of the art mmogs behave.

So the ideal 'challenging game' should kill you often and without 
warning? That is simply plain silly.

Its self evident that there are ways to increase the difficulty of a 
game without 'annoying unpredictable surprises that wipe everyone'.

For starters, give the scripts branches. Sometimes the mob goes left, 
sometimes right, give him a selection of different friends he can summon 
at various stages instead of choosing the same thing, have the mob vary 
his tactics based on raid composition, have the mob vary his tactics 
based on how fast his health is dropping...

First, you have find the camera, preferably in advance to finding the 
ramp, then you have to use it (which may involve a subquest to turn on 
the power to that section of the base, and above all you have to 
recognize the ramp when you arrive from an angle which will not be from 
the same angle as the camera was.

If you do all that then you have -earned- the right to maybe not be 
obliterated. After all the correct strat might be to locate and disable 
the gun-of-death from behind before stepping onto the ramp... choosing 
to run the ramp might still be death. (and trying to find the gun might 
be a superior strat to trying to just run past it).

At any rate a player who goes through all that has earned for more than 
the player who ignorantly steps on the trap, and zap, loading please 
wait.

Really, how the heck can you say he 'earned' anything at all?

If anything he deserves to be shot a few more times for -not- finding 
and using the clues to avoid the trap entirely in the first place!
