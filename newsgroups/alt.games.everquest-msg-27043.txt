End game.
You know, Sleeper's Tomb, ToV, Tormax, Statue, Lendiniara, etc...

At those encounters, it's cleric, rogues, warriors and wizards.
Everyone else is a token presence.  Shamans are buffers and nothing
more (admittedly Focus/Sta/Primal adds like 1100hps to the warriors
and that is ALWAYS a good thing).

>Why?  Why was the cleric unneeded before Kunark?  

Before Kunark, the toughest non-named mobs were fire giants or
Fear/Hate mobs.  But even these once you got Togor on them, their
damage output plummetted.  It made healing almost optional.

>How did this change with
>each expansion?  

More and more 100% MR mobs making them unslowable, not to mention
warrior hitpoints went from around 2500 buffed at level 50 to over
5500 at level 60.  10 levels and they more than doubled their
hitpoints.

This made complete heals obscenely efficient.  Combine with the
inability to slow mobs and you have the only viable tanking being
level 55+ warrior using defensive and clerics chaining complete heals.

Hahahahaha!
Why because Velious zones would poof?
