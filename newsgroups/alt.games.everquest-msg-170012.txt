If my keys to TOFS are in the bank I can use them anyway?  If I die are they on
my corpse?  My partner and I always kept 2 sets of TOFS keys, one on us, one in
the bank.   That way if we died we'd have a spare set of keys.  You are saying
this isn't necessary?
Can I destroy the "physical" key once it's on my keyring?
