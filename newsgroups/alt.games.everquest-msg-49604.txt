I've seen this too. It's now no longer the most crowded server.

There is more roleplaying, definitely.

The language barriers are extreme. For me, they've stopped being fun.
My halfling warrior is level 8. For the last few levels he's put all training
points into Human-common. Human is still gibberish, so I can't group with
anyone except halflings (except for language training), and outside 
rivervale/misty thicket, can't auction, can barely ask for a bind, 
don't understand shouts. The language learning rate cap is way way way
too low. This is a game, not real life.

Good to know.

On mature servers, people can't sell patchwork because nobody wants it.
On FV, people can't sell it because many people can't afford it, and
there is a pelt shortage. Have also seen some tarnished weapon auctioning. 
Rivervale is especially poor; there are few
decent ways to make cash, and a couple of the newbie quests were
eliminated (temporarily, supposedly). 

I'm almost ready to give up on this server because the language barriers
and low language learning rate are no fun.
