In the end, aren't they all?

The formula is always the same.Kill a bunch of things to increase xp and get
new items, so you can kill bigger things to increase xp and get new items,

you can kill........

For crafting, it goes like this. Make stuff so you can increase xp and get 
new
recipes, so you can make better stuff to increase xp and get new recipes,
so you can......

Still .....its fun for a while.
