i meant indirectly - put the same aug on a jade mace versus a weighted axe,
and you'll notice one proc'ing more

yes, very true....i should have been clear in my original response; my
assumption was that guard III would have the same frequency as guard II, and
II is pretty decent (few times per fight)

if you have 1k+ points in ldon, you probably know how to nurse your
dexterity and milk your procs and such =)

i would imagine having 300 points of incoming damage absorbed over time is
better than probably lifetapping for 75 a handful of times over the same
time period, but i could be wrong, and more importantly, i can be thinking
of a different style of play than what you're thinking about

4 lifetaps would mean 300 hp, and that's including doing 300 damage to the
mob .....is the tap proc better against "easy" mobs? probably

if that's the case, then when a big fight comes up and you >need< to squeeze

seems like if you're hitting a mob that isn't "easy" then you'll have a
cleric aroudn, and if you need that mitigation, you'll get it

well then the question is yours to answer: is it worth it for tanks?
