    Four doors in the main Crypt area with the four nameds?

    Yeah, the "old" camps seem a bit cramped when you have a modern group
with all the bells and whistles. Sebilis in particular feels VERY cramped
when there's an AoE group set up in Disco.

    In the old days, people didn't pull Emp if they didn't have the high
level character to single the Emperor or his PH. Since he was one of the
easiest sources of high-level spells, and since his room does have a good
number of spawns to XP off of, I used to see a fair number of Emperor/Blood
groups. Nowadays the Crypt group will almost always have someone to single,
and leaves the Emp room spawns up.

    I've noticed a lot of names get recycled. For example, on my server the
Eyes camp in Velk's is called Safe Hall (or SH) because of how it resembles
the safe hall in Guk.
