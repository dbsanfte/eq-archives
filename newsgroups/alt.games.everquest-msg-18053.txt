Well your AOHELL not being busy is luck or due to the fact
you are in the uk.  In the US, when i used it, I had to have
5 different numbers to try to get through.  Then often times
you would get disconnected after an hour or so.  I haven't
used it since i got my cable modem over a year ago, but it
used to be that using AOHELL for internet access, didn't
count as using it, and you would get disconnected because of
not using the program.  Their email is not compatible with
normal accepted email formats, at least not 100%.  Some
people have trouble reading email from @aol.com addresses
and vice versa.  

If you are into something like Geneaology, then AOL is quite
nice for that, the forums are a great way to find and
exchange information, but if you want a true internet
service provider and not a portal service, then AOL is not
for you.

As for Microsoft, my only complaints or issues would be with
the huge gaping security holes in Outlook express (Lets face
it, its a virus writers wet dream), and the fact the
interface is written to be used by people with no clue other
than how to turn on the computer, until you get an error,
and then your trying to figure out lines of code, with no
known way to access it.  I don't claim to be any sort of
expert, and I use Win 98, mostly because i am too lazy to
install and learn linux.  I have used Unix before, back in
college and it seemed like a wonderful interface, etc.  But
then the WWW didn't really exist either.  Newsgroups were
virtually spam free.  If you went to alt.binaries.<anything
you want to insert here> you didn't have to sort through 200
porn adverts to find the two on topic posts.
