Bah, the BSA is nothing more than an advertising gimick. People are afraid
that BSA is gonna come in and find them out of compliance so they go and buy
extra licenses just in case. They have no legal right to audit you if you
don't let them. Throw away their mailers and if they show up at your door
(which they won't unless you invite them first, because they can't) say
"good day sir, now get off the company's property before I have you escorted
off by security."

CompUSA and the like get info packets sent to stores in the area where BSA
is going to be running one of their campaigns telling them to expect
increased sales and to thus stock extra copies of software published by BSA
member companies.
