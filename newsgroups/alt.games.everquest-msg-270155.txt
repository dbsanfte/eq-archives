But rather than make it impossible to buff or otherwise aid people
outside your group, if the goal was to prevent high level characters
PLing lowbies, why not be more direct?  Make it impossible to cast
spells or otherwise aid a character too many levels below you.  Or
at least disallow high level spells (i.e., maybe it's okay to let a
high level character cast low level spells).  EQ1 did some of that
when they changed KEI and various other spells to require the target
be at least a certain level.  Better yet, to keep it simpler for good
samaritans to do "drive-by buffs", just let that high level druid
cast SOE or Shield of Thorns, and if the target is too low they only
get the effect (and duration) of SOW or Shield of Thistles.  (Hm,
might be best if the caster only got docked the mana for the lower
spell, too.)

I *really like* that when I'm dashing into Rivervale to visit the
druid guild or tribute master, I can look around there and in Misty
and often find a lowbie on whom I can throw a few buffs.  Sure, it's
a bit of PLing, but (a) if they don't like it they can click them off,
and (b) I'm not sticking around to keep the buffs fresh, so they still
have to do most of the work on their own.  I certainly got my share of
such passing buffs when I was starting out, and I enjoy passing along
the kindness.  EQ2 really doesn't sound like my cup of Qeynos Afternoon
Tea at all.
