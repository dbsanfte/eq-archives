They work independantly.

Say 20 delay is in off hand and 29 in primary then every 2.0 the Off hand
has the oppotunity to attack (needs to make a successful DW test first)
every 2.9 secs you primary attacks.
Dual Wield is a skill and as such is never (even at 60) a guaranteed
success, I believe this is why people get confused and think that the weapon
in their primary hand's delay has any effect on the one in their off hand.

Something odd I've noticed, I use a Bloodpoint in my primary hand and a Club
of the Ice Ocean in my secondary. Bloodpoint has a delay of 21 and Club 27.
In theory the BP should always attack first but I have often seen a crush
attack first (I have my misses turned on so Iknow I didn't mis with the
piercer first) only explaination I can think of is the timing of attack is
stored and the club was due to have an attack when the last combat ended,
any ideas?
