I should also say that this character stood around during many of the fights
because he was watching a game on TV while grouping with us.  He was group
leader so we eventually split off from him.  So I highly doubt this person
was asking such a specific question as you said.

I don't really think the guy was dumb.  Just lazy.  There are very easy ways
to test things out in the game, or to simply listen to other people talking
throughout the game.  And even more, find the websites on the game and READ,
something that is sadly lacking in today's world.

I could answer what all the stats do simply from reading on
eq.castersrealm.com which I always read before creating a new character.
