I don't use a custom UI, mostly.  I have a few selected components from
the old default UI, such as the 5x2 hotbars, installed as a custom UI,
but I don't think that's the issue.  This is something that's stored in
<character>_<server>.ini.

For instance, under [HotButtons3], my cleric used to have "Page1Button6=F21".
That caused page 1 button 6 in hotbar 3 to be a copy of my ammo slot.  Now,
however, that slot shows empty.  I'm guessing F21 now represents the new
gear slot.  If I make a fresh hotkey of my ammo slot, the .ini file instead
shows it as Page1Button6=F22 now.

Similar, my druid's crucible of escape in the last inventory slot was
hotkeyed, and it showed up under [HotButtons] as Page1Button9=F29.  That
hotkey was now invoking the 7th inventory slot.  When I made a fresh key
for the 8th slot, it appeared in the .ini file as F30.
