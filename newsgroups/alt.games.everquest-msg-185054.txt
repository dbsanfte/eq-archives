Your flames, while abundant, lack vigor or sting.

In language you might be able to understand, you talk a lot of shit, but 
you don't talk very good shit.

Wow, you really are clueproof. Let's analyze this:

You said:
But, then, I'm sure you used the bad
wording in hopes I'd give you something new to attack me on. (Hey,
it's no more ridiculous than saying SOE is accessing people's
computer's remotely and shutting down their EQ program to save a few
cents here and there on bandwidth)

So, in summary, you start a flame war over black helicopters for no 
apparent reason than to see yourself spout bullshit and talk like you know 
fuck-all about SOE's internal operations and/or the costs of production 
grade redundant bandwidth, then you yourself get all paranoid, citing THE 
VERY PARANOIA YOU WERE TRYING TO FLAME as justification.

That is not SARCASM, that is IRONY.

> How do you show your face in public?

Your sense of self importance must be as massive as your misplaced self 
assurance if you think this flame war has any bearing on my real life or my 
own self worth.

So, kindly go piss up a rope.
