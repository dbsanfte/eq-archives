>Hate crime laws which create new 'crimes' are a different matter.

New laws are enacted all the time.

Sometimes existing legislation does not adequately
reflect society's outrage, and new laws are
needed.

This is just one example of why hate crimes should
be prosecuted as such;

"What sets hate crimes apart from other acts of
violence is the psychological damage that they
leave behind. The American Psychological
Association has determined that victims of hate
crimes suffer the symptoms of post-traumatic
stress disorder and can as long as five years to
recover from these symptoms following their
victimization."

Isn't that what deterrence is, enforcing the
correct thought?

Forcing someone to consider the consequences of
their actions.

Personal issues?

People can think what they want without
consequences, it is their actions they are held
responsible for.

I'm not sure what you are getting at here... an
example perhaps?
