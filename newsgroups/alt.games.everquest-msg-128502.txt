No, I'm pointing out that the god YOU believe in is criminally

that out.

This is terribly amusing coming from someone who believes in
Christian (and even worse, Mormon) mythology.  Jesus (no pun
intended), a *Mormon* claiming *my* beliefs have no firm
foundation.  Oh, the irony!

: Oh, and Ed Jensen, you can kiss my ass.

Tsk tsk!  Do unto others...

I don't like OR respect your ignorant belief system.  I don't see
how that's a problem (except for you).

: If you're too petty to try to find the truth,

*I'm* too petty to try to find the truth?!  Hahahahaha!!!

Mama and Papa sure taught you to be a good brainwashed Mormon.
Tell them "congratulations!" for me.

: and instead
: insist on clinging to your pseudo-scientific views, it's not my problem.

Point out any pseudo-scientific things I've said.  I'm willing
to bet you won't find any.

I thought you might.

: Oh, and Lokari.... I expected better than cheap shots from the sidelines
: from you.

Lokari is one of the *more* clued people that hangs around
these parts.  You should listen to him/her.
