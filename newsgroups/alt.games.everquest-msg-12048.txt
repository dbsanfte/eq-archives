I went over 70 days played this past week and I was thinking about all
the different ways I could have made my leveling faster, and realized
that I have played my first character almost exclusively.  I certainly
didn't place my stats optimally, and then I didn't have the correct
gear (still using Adamite Epalets for Bristlebane's sake!).  I am sure
that there are other true first characters out there and am just
wondering what other stubborn fools have leveled what should have been
a throw-away.
Oh, and can I say that I am glad I'm not a treehugger, Plane of Growth
dropped some SERIOUS armor.  Got 4 cleric pieces, 3 SK pieces, and 3
war/bard/cleric/sk chests in 4 hours.  Not to mention about a dozen
other nice drops.  Heh-heh, finally, a way to stick it to the druids.
