Funny, I thought you were going to say Elven Royal Guard there - after all
they, along with First Dwarven Brigade, were the first crossteamers on the
servers which was the start of the slide towards 4-teaming. Plus ERG is a
huge bunch of immortally healing, bindrushing, training, exploiting whining
brats who are in desperate need of a collective slap.

What guild were you in again?

Or, alternatively, the guildleader quit playing and most of the members got
fed up with backflagging new recruits. Those that didn't quit are now in the
server uberguild, which has a fairly picky recruitment policy and tries not
to recruit idiots.

And no, I wasn't in Torrent ever, or an app to them.
