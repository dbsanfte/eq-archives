Yes and no :)  You do indeed get a very different result from /w all
count than you do from /w all count 1 60, and I believe you to be
correct in thinking that the difference is the anons and roleplays.
(And maybe that's what the official EQ spokespeople were referring
to).

However, I just tested /who all count druid versus /who all count
druid 1 60 and there was no difference in the numbers (other than the
occasional discrepancy by 1 which I think can be explained by log ons,
etc.)  I tried it several times, with different classes.

It appears that specifying either a level number or a class will leave
out anons, so the only thing you can do is get a count of the total
number of anons on the server, which is less than useful in my
opinion.

Since I'm getting rather interested in this, I did a test on Tunare.
/w all count returned 1276.  /w all count 1 60 returned 913.  I then
went through and did /w all bard count, /w all cleric count, etc. for
all 14 classes.  Since this took a while to do, the number cannot be
expected to agree precisely, but when I added them all up it came to
926.  Seems pretty clear anons aren't getting included.
