I agree - the only arguments I've heard against this so far have been
nothing more than tantrums.  If you're so high that you can breeze through a
level of greens and scrape up items (to sell, usually), then no one is going
to feel sorry for you.  If you're that high, why not help the real newbies
who loot the items by buying them from said players (this is directed at the
first reply, not you GP)
