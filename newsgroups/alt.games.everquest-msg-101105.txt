Rezzes are different. MUCH Different, as someone else pointed out when the
same analogy was already used. I'll take any rez I can get that offers some
EXP. Ports are different because they involve time constraints. A port to BB
+ Run to Gfay is MORE TIME than a direct port to Gfay. If I ask for a Port
to Gfay (with an alt for instance) I want a port to Gfay, not BB. I agree
with the originator of this thread.
