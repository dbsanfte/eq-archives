Yes, that's true.  There's such a thing as too many cooks in the
kitchen.  In the case of EQ2, I'm not sure how many cooks they have
now, and when more cooks would stop being advantageous.

Hiring new employees is expensive in terms of time and expense since
it takes a long time to find them, hire them, train them, get them
productive, etc.

Moving EQ1 resources to EQ2 would lower the "opportunity cost" because
presumably they could be productive much faster, and thus SOE could
get that next cash cow out much sooner (even if it's just an EQ2
expansion).

I guess if SOE cut off almost all EQ1 work -- no more expansions,
critical bug fixes only, minimal customer service, etc. -- the costs
would be fairly low.  Then again, if they did that, I just can't
imagine EQ1 would last long...  People seem to have been steadily
losing interest in EQ1 even *with* those things...

Ditto.

It'll be interesting to see how it all works out!
