Subject: All Your Base Are Belong To DAoC

Im looking forward to DAoC but I think the whole 'xxx vs EQ' is bullshit.
Theres room enough for more than just one mmorpg'y thingy and competition is
good as it forces the developers to improve their games/services. It all
reminds me of the amiga vs atari-at and megadrive vs snes and UT vs quake. I'ts
not about whether One is going to own the other. Imho EQ has such a large and
addicted i mean devoted fan base I wouldnt be surprised if it lived forever.
Verant's game obviously has some winning formula to have attracted and held so
many that they arent going to just forget they love the game as soon as any new
game arrives.

btw, The ST fuxing 0wnz th3 Amiga six ways from sunday. ;) The fact that you
have to risk spinal injury to plug the mouse in seperates the men from the
boyz!!
