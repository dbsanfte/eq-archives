I was using, by the way, a Runewood Great Staff, if that
helps, although really you are probably better off going
the one hander and shield route, giving you more
AC and more opportunities to upgrade into Wis gear.

I was a hard headed 2hb user, the biggest advantage
being that they aren't really as good strategically
as one hander and shield, so you can find some pretty
good bargains.  I paid a big 100pp for that runewood,
and the seller was glad to finally find someone who
wanted it.  A comperable weapon in a one hand blunt
would probably fetch 500pp.  Since I knew that
melee wasn't going to work forever, I didn't want to
spend a ton of cash on the project.
