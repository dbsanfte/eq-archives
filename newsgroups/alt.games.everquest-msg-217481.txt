Ok, for the "dang LDoN" post several days ago (I didn't get the points for a
successful dungeon)...here's the update

I petitioned in game...no answer...
Finally, an Apprentice Guide got online.  Sent him a tell.
He said "uh, that does sound like a problem...petition it."

"I did petition it, no answer"

"uh, petition it again"

ok, sounded stupid, but I petitioned again...no answer.  Next day, I sent
tell to another GM...he said to go to EQ website and report it to my
server's GM.  so I did...finally, today, I get an answer (pasted below).
What kind of BS is this?  I'm just asking for the points that I
earned...it's not like I spent them on something and went "uh...can I have
my points back?"  I earned them and did not get them.  WTF?  SOE Customer
Service needs to actually add SERVICE to their workday.

They can make this game, but can't check their log to see that I didn't get
my points????????

message = We were going to do a dungeon in EF so I could get spell
Spirit of Shrew (48 adv points)

Before start, I had 47 Miragul's pts and 15 Rujarkian pts total 62.
Guildies show up, and we successfully complete the dungeon.  Get message
that says I earned 15 points.  After zoning and getting back to Wayfarer
camp, I still had only 47 Miragul's pts and 15 Rujarkian pts total 62
pts.  I've petitioned in game, and no one has been able to tell me
anything.  Last night, AG Rohn said to send this today.
