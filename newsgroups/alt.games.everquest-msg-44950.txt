 This is probably a post for another thread, but does anyone know how
one goes about increasing faction with Rangers? I believe that's who
keeps attacking me. The Druids at the WC Ring aren't really Druids, they
are Rangers. Or at least on that faction. I am dubious at the NK/EK ring
but the guys in WC attack me, which I'm guessing means they are on a
faction other than JaggedPineFolk.
