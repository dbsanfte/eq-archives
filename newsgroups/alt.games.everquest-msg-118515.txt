  Ugh.  Gasts.  I just got done killing about 40 or so of them, didn't keep track of
the numbers.  I wanted 4 hearts for myself, of course, and another 3 for a guildie
that offered me 300 plat (a forture to most level 11's on FV) in return for them.  I
did tell her that I thought she was being too generous, but what the hey, she
insisted, and I didn't want to offend her (heh).  Got enough to buy Lenny a BABS, and
my level 14 spells too.  The trivial loot code makes for some odd business deals, let
me tell you what.
    Anyways, it was tramatic.  I did the bulk of it myself, with only the Sense Dead
spell to guide me.  I banked everything I had, only carried a summoned hammer, food
and water with me.  I was competing at times with others who had hired pet rangers to
help them out.  And some wierdo Barbarian keep offering to buy the hearts I did have,
for a whole 5pp each!  And I kept getting killed by brownie scouts, that psychotic
black horse, and of course, Our Buddy Thistle Underbrush.  
  So yes, do as Biz suggests.  Hunt the crap out of that little bastard.  And don't
worry about giving him a clean death, either, even if he begs for it.
