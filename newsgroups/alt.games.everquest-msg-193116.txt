How does spell stacking work?

If two spells have a similar effect in the same slot, does that mean
they DO stack or DONT stack?  Or is that not enough information to
determine if they stack or not?

For example, here are some stats from Lucy:

  Breeze
  slot 2: increase mana by 2 per tick

  Clarity
  slot 2: increase mana by 4-7 per tick

  Flowing Thought I
  slot 2: increase mana by 1 per tick

They all use slot two, and they all have a similar effect.  But
Breeze and Clarity clearly don't stack, while Clarity and FT1 do.
Why is that?  Is FT special because it's an effect and not really
a spell?

If I'm wrong and FT doesn't stack with Clarity, then I'll just
sit down and shut up.  :-)
