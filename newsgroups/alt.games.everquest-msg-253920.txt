Math is the perfect solution for any situation where you must keep track of
various amounts of diffrent commodoties that are used up and produced at
differing rates.

There are other solutions you do understand but none really get the job done
:p Im really fond of make these every chance you get and then put them over
there, also the similiar by god if you ever make another one of those im
gonna bury you.

Science is the most usefull when after extended periods of observation,
identification, experimental investigation, and theoretical explanation of
phenomena we find out things that where not originally obvious. We find out
that sometimes what makes perfect common sense is just plane wrong.
Economics is the science of money and production, it is frequently referred
to as the dismal science. It teaches us things that we really just did not
want to know. Only 1 in 20 people ever bother to study the dismal science,
the rest are oh so much more comfortable deciding that all that economics
stuff is just a religion.

Oh and I am religious ! I worship at the altar of science. The rest is just
the demon haunted world.

All of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast
as video in a single large American city in a single year. Not all bits have
equal value.
Carl Sagan

In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really
good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they actually change their
minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it.
It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and
change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the
last time something like that happened in politics or religion. [Carl Sagan,
1987 CSICOP keynote address]

We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in
which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology.
Carl Sagan
