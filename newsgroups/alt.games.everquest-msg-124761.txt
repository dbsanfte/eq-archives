I was totally in favor of it. One of the other positive side effects is
that it cuts down on the "buddy buddy" atmosphere that can develop over
time. We wound up getting a new server GM right before this change went
into effect, but prior to that I personally saw screen shots of guidchat
from one of our server's largest guilds with the GM talking with them
*in* guild chat. And it didn't look like any normal customer service
conversation either.

I knew they could monitor it if they wanted, but I didn't know they ever
had conversations in it.  But in any event, whether there's anything
shady going on or not, it's still just bad policy to do anything that
can even give the *appearance* of impropriety in situations like this.

We had that very same guild pulling some bullshit a couple weeks ago
that involved some of their members repeatedly killing a merchant that
numerous other people were trying to access. No matter what reason you
give for it, that's grief playing, pure and simple. There were easily
three dozen petitions filed, with most of the petitioners being
answered. No action was taken. That sort of thing is just bad medicine
in CS, and leaves your customers figuring the system is rigged anyway,
so why bother?
