Even though I am the one who reported "Stinkyfinger" ( once again, assuming 
that you are on Karana ), I wouldn't think of reporting "Nimblethorne".  
Stinkyfinger is a blatant reference, whereas I have to stretch to make any 
kind of obscure reference to anything offensive with "Nimblethorne".  I 
have never, and will never -hear-, anyone make any sentence in RL with the 
word / phrase "Nimblethorne" in it.  I have heard, and will hear in the 
future, people make a reference to "Stinkyfinger", and it was always used 
in the exact way that Bizbee ( I believe ) pointed out elsewhere in this 
thread.

Stinkyfinger was an obvious play to beat the filter and have an offensive 
name - this is evidenced by the fact that Cogito thinks "kicksyaindachips" 
is "clever".  It's a young mindset, and they go hand-in-hand.
