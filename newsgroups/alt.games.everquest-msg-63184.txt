Yeah but that staggering level of incompetence only has to be executed by
one person. Any one idiot can train the main group with 8 mobs at once thus
killing everyone. The younger and less experienced the people are the more
you need to break in . This tends to create situations where you need 30
people to hold your little corner and each and everyone has to behave. Add
to this mobs that fear, blind, and teleport away. Add to this absolute
desperation on the part of a few people who just HAVE to get there corpse
just right over there loot and port out. Add to this a single grief player
who is trying his best to get everyone killed while not getting noticed .

I am willing to go in and break fear clearing the portal area of mobs and
all the wandering mobs with a good group of 6 . There is no way in hell I
would go in with an inexperienced guild. With 6 it is fun . With 18 who know
what they are doing it is boring as all hell . With an inexperienced guild
it is a disaster.
