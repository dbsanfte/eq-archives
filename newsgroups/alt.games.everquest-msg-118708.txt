Ok, have any of you ever been to any of these?  This is August 2dn-3rd.
This one is only an hour from where I live and might want to check it out,
but don't want to bother if they are lame.

Can anyone enlighten me on whether or not these are worth the trip?

Whether I go or not it doesn't matter.  The TOOL show on the 4th will
probably devastate me.  I might need to save my strength for that.  Hell,
I'm not exactly 18 anymore, hehe.  TOOL ROCKS!

TIA,
SEAN...
