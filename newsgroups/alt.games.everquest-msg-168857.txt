Um.. it isn't inflated if people are willing to pay that much. If
people are willing to pay a certain amount rather than farm the drop,
then that is what the item is worth at that particular point in time.

Right.. and because people bought... that is what the item was worth.
If you didn't want the item, nobody is forcing you to pay it. Anything
that moves out of a price range that i do not wish to pay, i do not
buy. And its not like making money using the bazaar is hard.

Heh, what i hate though are the guys that try to come off like they're
used car salesman. It was actually pretty funny, we had one guy
spouting off at the mouth about his prices being lowlowlow cause he
didn't like the people who jacked up the prices. So, I pulled him up
and he had Spider Silk at 2p. LQ, MQ, and HQ pelts at 2p, spiderling
silk at 2p and what not. After I cleaned him out(and he had quite a
bit of all of them) I /tell'd him and told him what i was gonna do
with the material.

Conversions... a few clicks here and there and i had silk swatches
that I put up for 10p. 6p profit a swatch. And leather padding which
always sells at 25p. 6p cost, 19p profit. Fact is, if you don't know
what your material is worth at a certain point in time, don't blame
the guy who does for making a profit out of your hide.

Hell.. i gotta pay for my uber tradeskills somehow :>. Its actually
pretty interesting, there was a time that i thought 20p was a fortune,
now i throw around pp like it was spaghetti. 1K here... 2K there. My
account in one day went from 3.5K to 100p back to 4.5K while culling
some of the materials that I bought for tradeskill usage.

I'm currently in the process of getting setup for 120 high level
smithing combines at 175 skill. 60 of the Fine Plate Breastplate and
60 of the Field Plate Visor back to back. Allready have the tempers
worked... just need to keep working my account up to 10K so that I
could use 7K to pay for the ore while still leaving a reserve :>.
It'll probably take a week or less if i don't see some other thing
that I need first. Nice part is that once you build yourself up to
around 10K it all just keeps rolling over because ore and molds are
usually paid for on a success and the levels we are talking about here
the geerlok should give nice success rates.

Heh.. i wonder if i'm the only one stupid enough to actually try to
use the Field Plate Visor to bump :>. Most people either jump to
higher cultural or go the Mistletoe Cutting Sickle route.
