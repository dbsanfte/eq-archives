Good evening all,

After the recent patch I got problems in the logon procedure - At the server 
selection screen, when the correct server is selected and 'Play EverQuest' 
is pressed, it just crashes to desktop.

This is a new one for me - it worked perfectly Sunday evening.

The newest WineX is installed, as is the new script file.


Any WineX users who has the same experience - and hopefully a fix ??


best regards,

GF
