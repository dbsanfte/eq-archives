well thanks for that.  you hear it a lot lately, and it's nonsense of a

people always love to fall for appearance over substance.  rather than
go off my writing, here's an interesting piece from the Independant in the UK,
where they have enjoyed being particularly harsh:

By Fergal Keane

Anybody who has ever made a political judgement based on appearances 
should have learnt a lesson this week. A man written off by the 
intelligentsia as a bumbling jackass when he came to office, and 
denigrated ever since, achieved a political feat that has eluded so 
many American presidents. George Bush is a man in charge of his own 
house, and the people who once wrote him off as the village idiot of 
the Beltway have been shocked into silence.

Just a week ago most observers would have refused to believe that the 
UN Security Council might offer unanimous backing to a resolution that 
puts Saddam under pressure to disarm or face military action. Even Syria, 
the voice of the Arab world on the council, saw fit to support the move. 
There is a commitment to consult the council if the weapons inspectors 
find Iraq in "further material breach", but President Bush has won his 
most important international battle. The key words in this resolution 
are "serious consequences". Everybody knows what that means, and it 
will be hard for any of the permanent members to dissemble if the Iraqi 
leadership fails to provide anything less than 100 per cent co-operation 
with Mr Blix.

Seven weeks ago President Bush was said to have little inclination for 
taking his case against Saddam to the UN. The Rumsfeld-Cheney-Wolfowitz 
axis appeared to be all-powerful � to hell with the foreigners and their 
hand-wringing, let's just attack Iraq. But urged on by Tony Blair, 
President Bush did go to New York and make his case; he also waited � and 
waited � while Colin Powell negotiated and re-negotiated a draft resolution. 
Bush certainly listens to the Rumsfeld brigade, and it is they in the end 
who will likely have the final word on whether Saddam is attacked or not. 
But Bush is no ventriloquist's dummy for the right. As an American colleague 
put it to me yesterday: "It's very clear that they work for him, not the 
other way around."

With Capitol Hill in the hands of the Republicans and a UN resolution that 
gives America almost all of what it wanted in relation to Iraq, Mr Bush has 
achieved a greater sway over domestic and international affairs than even 
that enjoyed by Ronald Reagan. Remember that the first Reagan administration 
still had to take into account the power of the Soviet Union. Mr Bush, by 
contrast, is master of a universe whose complexities and differences he 
has so often delighted in ignoring.
