    If that "etc" doesn't include Kith, you're SOL here.

    So the NPCs that talk about the ships are wrong?

    NPCs in game say the game is wrong. :-)

    What stat is harder to raise? AGI? We all know how useful high AGI is.

    I'd have to see the starting stats beside one another to compare, but
I'd likely go WE just because of the night blindness issue.

    I have a mana pool a little over 3500 MANA. Know how much that is? NOT
ENOUGH. Our "real mob" fights take ten minutes or more to complete. Count
the CHs I need to cast. Every point of mana, hell every point of Flowing
Thought counts. I personally rate HPs above MANA only because of the
importance I place on aggro control and avoiding low HP aggro when
chain-modding. If that bracer had lots of WIS instead of MANA, I'd agree it
was junk. But as is it's endgame material.

    I cannot control the quality of player you associate with. You might
want to ask them what they plan to wear instead, and whether their decision
is based on quality or perceived difficulty of the quest.

    Why, does your guild hate you? Seriously - does your guild award items
that are "best in my class" to people outside that class?

    Crushbone also has mind-numbing bugs, like D'Vinn stuck at zone and elf
slaves / Retlon assisting the orcs. My experiences are limited, but I have
yet to see the mob in Blackburrow that can suddenly go berserk when it was
non-KOS before and start chain-nuking you while its pet roots you.

    When I played around with a baby WE ranger, that's what it took for me
to find my way back to Kelethin - I had to memorize the name of the newbie
lift guard and track my way back to him. I don't know what the other classes
did - I assumed they were the ones that were shouting "Has anyone seen my
corpse?" (Not an issue today, mind you.)

    GFay has wandering orcs that would do the job just as well (and they
wander on the paths, too). And what the hell are Varsoon and Pyzjin doing
up? They aren't dead yet? :-)
