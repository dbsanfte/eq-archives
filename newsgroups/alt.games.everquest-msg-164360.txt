What are the racial penalties and do they apply to all levels?

Here is what I have heard, but not confirmed, trying to do that here.

Hafling: ??
Human:  +10% (bonus not a penalty)
Erudite:  +10% (bonus not a penalty)
Gnome:  0%
Wood Elf: ??
High Elf: ??
Dark Elf ??
Barbarian: ??
Ogre: -20%
Troll: -25%
Iksar: -25%

The numbers are from a SK site I was looking at.

I know the class penalties were removed the game over a year ago.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Mike
