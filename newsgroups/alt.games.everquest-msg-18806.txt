my monk will be very happy when this gets fixed, as all she needs to
complete all of the headband quests are the Skull of Brother Dareb and the
head of Brother Shen (already have the head of Ghanex Drah)

and then she just needs the blackened wand for the last sash quest (which,
also according to this link, should still drop, though not necessarily off
the same mob.)
