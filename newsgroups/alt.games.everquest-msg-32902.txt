I disagree on the AC issue, I take AC first stat bonus second, At higher lvls I
have found AC to be very important.  when you cast complete heal you will more
then likely get aggroed, a good ac allows you not to get hit as often and
prevents your spells from getting interrupted.  I have been on raids where I was
the only cleric left standing after a bad pull or what ever, this is no
accident.

"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise
the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness,
enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others
of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind.
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."
