Note that there is a big difference between "light blues" and "low
blues" ***
Light blues are almost trivial. These mobs used to be Green (until light
blue was added). I believe that they give you much less xp (a half ?).
Low blue mobs are the best for xp hunting (provided that there is a
constant supply) this becomes more obvious at higher levels.

At level 12 the distinction between even con mobs and low blue mobs is
not very much.
Most of the time a level 12 chanter can take an even con mob (I took a
yellow straight after getting my new pet), try doing that when you are
45.

HTH,

Jim

*** Low blues are for example the lowest level mob that is still Dark
Blue to you.
