I just fixed all my commonly-used hotkeys to use sense heading whenever I 
hit them.  Now whenever I check the time (I do that a LOT) and whenever I 
"bash" I up my sense heading skill.  I've gone from 0 to 19 in just a 
couple of play sessions.

(One problem I have though, is when I'm running and hit "time", for some 
reason whenever sense heading activates, all the text on-screen starts 
vibrating rapidly up and down the screen, and tends to hurt my eyes - I 
still haven't figured out why and how to fix it :()
