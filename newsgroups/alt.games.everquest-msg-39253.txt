*grin*  The 34 paladin was the one I played 2 years ago when the game first
started.   It was pretty funny then, as in a high level dungeon such as
Mistmoore (yes, back then Mistmoore was thought of as high level) I would be
the *only* person there without a last name.    Kinda freaked some people out,
and I got at least a few "What is a newbie doing fighting in here?" comments.
