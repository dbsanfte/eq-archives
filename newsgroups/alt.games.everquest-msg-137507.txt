Well said, Richard. Better than I would have, but my sentiments exactly.
The portable shower has some nice stats on it, and quick mana-free
rezzing is certainly a plus for a raid wipeout.  But in the end, it
really just does something that every cleric in the game can do at level
56. (Which isn't very hard to achieve, really.) It just does it faster.
