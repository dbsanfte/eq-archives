It depends.  If, as people have said, the druid CH isn't going to
squeeze clerics out of endgame content, I don't have a problem with
it.  Don't like it, but I'm stubborn.

But not as high as the REAL damage dealing classes, monks and rogues.

I did make the mage caveat in the part of my post you snipped.

Useful is different from necessary.  Druids are useful on virtually of
raid mobs, but they aren't necessary.

Amen.

I wasn't saying any of these classes were useless on raids.  They are,
but (excepting mages apparently) none of them are "necessary" for a
raid the way the "Unholy trinity" are considered necessary.
