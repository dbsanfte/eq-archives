Yes and no. Part of what makes Everquest so popular is the challenge, I 
agree with that, but the other half of its success is its "sense of 
place", so to speak... The richness of lore and history, the variety of 
monsters, the quests, the tradeskills (underdeveloped as they are), the 
landscapes, the vistas... things like the sun rising in the desert of Ro, 
or simply seeing fungus spores skittering about in the Innothule Swamp. 
It's a tremendously rich world, that feels very alive. This is why the 
old text MUDs can't reach the massive audiences EQ does, even if they are 
technically better RPGs.

Part of the reason for this richness is that they chose to go with 
discrete zones, rather than a huge and bland world, like in Asheron's 
Call. The other reason is that their success has enabled them to keep an 
active development team. My point is that, by pandering also to more 
casual players, they have now the resources needed to add to the wealth 
of content that is the one true asset of EQ. I'm still *amazed* at the 
fact that, after three years of playing tourist, there are whole zones I 
haven't set foot into, and I'm still finding new things in zones I 
thought I knew like the palm of my hand.

If this comes at the cost of making levels 1-10 a cakewalk, so be it.
