Since I got to port-capable levels, I'm getting a fair share of guild
invites, which I've politely rejected so far. The question is, and
forgive me if I sound mercenary... What do guilds have to offer
characters who mostly solo, other than /guildchat during meditation
time? At the rate I'm leveling, EQ will be long gone before I have to
worry about raids and stuff, and so far almost all of my income comes
from porting people around, and I guess that that would dissapear if I
became a guild taxi.

So, what's the upside? There must be one, because, at least in Fennin
Ro, it's really hard to see *anybody* of any level or class who is not
on a guild, and I'm getting lots of incredulous "how come you aren't
guilded" tells.

As a related question... If I decided to bite the bullet and go
gregarious, what's a good resource to compare guild reputations in
Fennin Ro? So far I've got invites (of the few I remember) from Blood of
Honor and Court of Jesters.

Thanks.
