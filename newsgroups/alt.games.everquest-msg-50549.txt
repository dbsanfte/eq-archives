Well i am not sure on Wizard spells, but with my Necro, i am not
planning on training in research til i hit 24 i don't think.  at 16, i
can buy all but the root undead spell.  at 20 I think Harmshield is the
only research only spell (i may however if i find the words, ask a
higher necro to press combine for me on this one).  At 24 however, i
can't just buy my pet from a shadowknight guild.  I figure at 24, having
not spent a point since putting one in meditate, I will have plenty of
points to spend on raising my research skill, and can wait til then,
throwing words in the bank.
