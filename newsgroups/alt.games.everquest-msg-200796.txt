Yeah, she was 250 baking by then, so her unbuffed WIS would be around
230.  Hardly cost anything to get her there, could be done by 28 if you
were smart with your cash/items and dumped started points into WIS
(starting WIS of 115 means I only had to make up 115 points of WIS on
gear). 

Okay, at 28 you get 5.6 mana per WIS up to 200, so that's 1120 mana
there, plus another 30*5.8 = 174, so we're up to 1294 mana without
taking into account raw mana gear (which she doesn't have much of so
we'll just omit that for now). 

With affliction efficiency 2 (she had a chipped bone bracelet) and mana
preservation 2 (she had a black alloy medallion, probably her biggest
twink item) Creeping Crud costs 75 mana and does 210 dmg in 1 minute,
Stinging Swarm costs 49 mana and does 117 dmg in 54 seconds.  Snare
costs 12 mana (I'm rounding all the fractions up, and this is
pre-affliction-focus-nerf) and would last ~2 minutes, so figure 6 mana
per minute there.  Root costs 32 mana, lasts for just over a minute
(we'll round this down to a minute) and does 10 dmg. 

Soooo...  For 163 mana per minute, or ~15% of my mana bar I would have
been doing 337 dmg. 

Now, take into account that while I was quadding the large zelniaks (lvl
32-35) were taking 9-10 lightning blasts at 172 dmg (probably a high
estimate, given that I usually get at least a few partial and probably
1-2 total resists during a kite), and the large zelniaks have appx
1720hp.  So 5 minutes of both dots up plus another 49 for the additional
stinging swarm required to finish the job gives 864 mana to kill a large
zelniak in about 5.5 minutes.  If I'm at FM, this gives another 400 mana
to devote to another large zelniak, and figure at 50% of the ticks I'll
be medding with a meditate skill of ~195, using a formula of 19mana/tick
for half the ticks in a minute (5), gives 95 mana per minute + 5 from
standing regen + 15 from sitting regen = 115 mana per minute regen'd,
over the course of 5 minutes gives 575 mana, added onto the 400 I had
left over from the first zelniak and I get enough to take down two reds
simultaneously with enough left over for about 3 root resists.  Consider
that they would be staggered since I usually pulled one and parked it
before pulling another, and I can take down 2 at a time pretty easily. 

Actually, I just realized I figured the wrong root into this.  The one I
would have been using would have cost 45 mana for 1.5 minutes (so about
30 mana per minute), and done about 36 points of damage (so average to
24 per minute), which gives a bit more room for error. 

We'll just ignore that she had KEI and was taking down 3 at a time with
mana to spare ;)
