    It's silly to say "it doesn't matter", because individuals decide their
own priorities, not some "master list of things you SHOULD care about". That
having been said, though, I agree with you in part: I think lower level
folks put WAY too much focus on getting that res and getting that XP back,
to the point of losing sight of why they want the res. I horrified a friend
recently when, instead of petitioning to have my bugged corpse in Lower Guk
moved so it could be ressed, I scooped the items off it. My WAR was 36 at
the time, so it was a full bub lost, but as I told my friend: I logged on to
have fun bashing stuff. If I'm on my ass waiting on some GM, I'm not bashing
stuff and I'm not having fun. And even though I'll get to have new, fun
experiences as I level, I'm not going to make the journey there hellish for
me - because I'll be let down when place X is pretty much like place Y, but
with new 'toons.
