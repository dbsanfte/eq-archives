LOL, no.  One spawns in South Ro and I know of a 35 Paladin and 43
Cleric combo that took him down although he is Kill Steal heaven.
Real common to have Higher level Wizzies and Mages and Necs sitting
back to blast him once he pops while you do all the work of killing
every undead near to get him to spawn.

The other is in the Ocean of Tears and is a 50+ camp.  On MT people
seem to be pretty good about doing the list thing and contacting you
even on other characters when your time is coming up and holding the
camp until you switch.
