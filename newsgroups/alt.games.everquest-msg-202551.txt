> - Shared Bank Vault

Woot - this will make twinking Marrtuk much easier.  =)  Plus I can now
create a bazaar mule and easily transfer items to him.  I need to do that...
I have a gajillion items to sell.

> - Spell Context Menus
> - Spell Favorites

Will be interesting to try these out.  My greatest concern: Divine Aura and
Divine Barrier.  These will be in every group of Spell Favorites I come up
with.  When I chose a new group of Spell Favorites, will it force me to
re-memorize DA and DB, thus making those spells unusable for fifteen
minutes?  I'll need to experiment.

> - Spell level limits now enforced

It finally happened.  I can understand and even support it from a gameplay
issue.  This was a bug that should have been fixed ages ago.  I agree that
this was not the way these spells were intended to be used, and support the
decision to correct that oversight.

In practice, KEI was an awfully convenient way to minimize downtime.  Now
poor Marrtuk will have to spend a lot of time sitting and medding.
Fortunately I was able to get him up to 40, so it won't be long before he
can use KEI again.  Still, it's unfortunate that the worst part of
Everquest - sitting and recovering for a long time after every fight - can
no longer be mitigated by getting KEI.

Question: what level will Marrtuk need to be before he can get KEI again?
I've heard 43, 44, 45, and 46.  Anyone know for certain?

Ahhhh.  This actually happened to me once.  Glad they fixed it.

> - Droga and Nurga

I'll have to check these out.  Marrtuk may give Nurga a go once he can get
KEI again.

> The reward for planar progression will be available this week.

Sweet.  It had long been guessed that awarding AA points would be the
reward, but a charm slot item - that'll be cool, too.  Almost everyone in my
guild does *not* have a charm item - no one bothers to group in LoY except
to do spell quests like Pure Blood.  So having something to put in an
otherwise-empty slot will be nice, too.  Can't wait to see it.

I find this mildly amusing simply because anyone with even a little plat can
buy much better weapons in the bazaar than can be found in LoY.  Heck, for a
long time Marrtuk was using a 20/28 2HB with no level restrictions at all
that he picked up for 4K.  Any weapon he might have gotten in LoY he likely
would have sold to a vendor right away.  The only good thing about the LoY
weapons is their very low delay - the dagger is a 6/18 piercer - that made
them excellent training weapons.  Still, that's about the extent of their
use.

> - Newly Stackable Items - Valor Crystals, Ceramic Linings,
> Holgresh Fur and Casks are now stackable.  Also, Valor
> Crystals can be sold to vendors.

Wow.  About freakin' time.  Monual can now go back to getting his pottery
and brewing about 240.  =)  I stopped pottery in the 160's or so because of
the ceramic lining thing, and the major obstacle to getting brewing up to
248 was the non-stacking casks.

These are *great* changes that will make tradeskilling a lot easier in
certain instances.

Overall, a patch with a lot of interesting implications.  Will look forward
to seeing what impact it has tonight.
