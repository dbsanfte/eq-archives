This entire arguement is really moot, no side knows for sure.

The important thing is that verant knows. They know what it costs
them to have 19 CS people on the legends server at all times. It costs
enough that the poll they put in a year or so ago actually asked if
you'd pay $49 dollars for more customer service on a server.  So, as
you can see, that figure actually went down by $10 of what their
original estimation was. You can do a search on eqcaster's realm for
"poll" to find that poll. 

Many people are forgetting that the 19 gms on legends are all full
time GMS, they are not volunteer guides. That makes the Legends server
overhead cost 18 x what a regular server with only one gm on at a time
costs (if it even has one on) in salaries alone. The reason for having
no guides is so that when a customer petitions they can get help very
soon from a real gm who can actually help them. Besides those 19 gms
there are other quest people on from time to time.

Along with the web site for legends customers, the ability to put a
guild page up for free at the site and some other extras verant might
just be breaking even. There is a reason why they figured $39 bucks
and a reason why they figured 8,000 players subscribing.
