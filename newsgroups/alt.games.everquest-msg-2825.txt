Yeah plus its easy to find real weird looking pictures on the net of
really ugly people. All it takes is looking around for real pictures
of people who frequent certain irc channels. Then you can engage in
the juvenile act of saying that one of them who is really ugly is
someone you don't like in a newsgroup.

What you should really do though is wonder just what is wrong with
yourself that you think its worthwhile to engage in such an activity.
At such a point you should realize that you are doing something really
pointless that makes you looking geeky, and then not do it.
