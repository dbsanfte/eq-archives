I played fine all day yesterday without doing any "reverting" of my systems
DirectX.   It is only on test (test uses the directx8 only engine) that I
see these problems.   When I was ready to play the standard server, I
repatched, and things seem ok.  I am not an expert, so take it for what it's
worth.  Shamu thinks I should reformat my hard drive and load all new
drivers fresh.   I agree since my win98se has been running for over a year
and undoubtablely  has "crap" in in, but I don't want to do such a drastic
thing quite yet.   Hoping to stretch this box out till early spring and
replace it with a new box preloaded with XP (letting XP season a bit first).
