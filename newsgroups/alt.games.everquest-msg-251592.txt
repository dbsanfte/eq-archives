Id rather group with him than someone that is such an arrogant scorner like
your self.  I havnt found that not many people like to be around
intellectualy abusive people like yourself.  Iv played eq for 2 years now
and the ones without the friends arnt the platinum-buying pond scum but the
social idiots like your self that society has no tollarence for.  I have
found that those that are not afraid to ask a question in the face of such
scorning blasts are indeed the most enlightened people on the face of the
earth and the most desirable to be around.  I have also found that people
that are so intellectualy abusive are the most ignorant of people on the
face of the earth.

Cheers
John Stewart
