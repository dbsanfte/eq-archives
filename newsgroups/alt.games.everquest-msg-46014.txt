hehe, ok, will do my best...

>What's a typical "day in the life" for a Warlord like?

A 'major raid day' usually begins with several hours sleep hehe. I'm on
GMT, the guild is mostly on EST, so a few hours shuteye before the start
works wonders. Being MT in a place like north ToV means you have to be
on the ball 100% of the time. And there's always officer stuff to do
too. A 'day in the life' is hard to condense into a few lines, because
days are different, depending on what we're doing. In short, for a
raid: Get there, wait for latercomers to get there, group up, kill
stuff, congratulate those who got loot, kill more stuff, congratulate
more people, throw in a few death/res/rebuff cycles, get a TLoc out and
go to bed hehe

> I mean, you're
>already sixty, so I can't imagine you spend much time "leveling". <g>

EXP is fairly easy to get in L60 (luckily) but don't think for one
second that hitting L60 means you're done with levelling. Even with L56
resses on hand, you still have to exp regularly to make up for deaths on
raids, and I usually spend some of the downtime between raids doing exp

>Are you in an uberguild that just raids all the time? (I know nothing
>about DH since I'm not on Zeb, sorry.)

DH is hovering around the second half of the top 10 uberest guilds
across servers. We used to be called SotS (Souls of the Shadow) on E'Ci,
before we movelogged as a guild, onto Zeb when it split. We joined a
'cell' of raiders from the Rathe, led by a relative of one of our
officers, and haven't really looked back since. We clear nToV in 2 days,
ST/Dain/Yeli/Cazic/1stBroods whenever they spawn if that helps to 'place
us' on the uberocity ladder. 

>Do you ever just get in regular hunting groups and grind xp with them?

Quite often do it for fun with friends. When I get down to 1 yellow in
60, I grind the 'safety zone' back up to 4 yellows. That happens a few
times a month, but goofing off in Seb or wherever with friends staves
off the urgency for a little longer, and is considerably more fun

>If you're not raiding 24/7, what are you doing?

See above. I also toy with tradeskills when nothing's happening, which
sinks a lot of surplus time and plat as an ogre hehe. 212 smithing now,
and 183 jewelcraft LOL. Most other tradeskills are over 100 too. I've
got a little ranger I sometimes play around on, and a druid for a change
of pace.

> Working on finding stuff
>to upgrade your kit?

Any upgrades for me require 40+ people these days. Once you've got
warlords, most upgrades are few and far between for a warrior, because
they're multiclass and others get bigger improvements from them. I'm
pretty lucky with what I've got already, and waiting for certain items
to drop. Next item I'm after should put me at about 1450ac fully buffed,
1500+ac 6k+ hp is what I'm striving for - about 4 items away. I
concentrated on getting weapons and I've pretty much set on that side
now (Jaelens/NevHorn/Primal and a Sceptre to borrow if I need it). No
point MTing if you can't hold agro heh. Now, if only Lord Koi would
cough up an AC Orb when I was around...

>Helping guildmates and others to level and catch up?

There's usually someone on doing something, whether it's exp, items,
quest gems, or quests like epics for alts or Thurg ring/shawl stuff.
I'll always prefer to be playing with friends, rather than PLing some
twink in some far away zone

>Or do you play a bunch of alts and just break out the big warlord when
>it's time for the guild to raid something tough?

As I said, I've got a couple of alts for a change of pace, but I'm a
warrior at heart, so prefer to play my big Ol' chunk of Ogre meat
whenever possible. I rolled him right out of the box and can't really
imagine playing anything else

The game takes on a new slant once the goal of L60 has been achieved.
EXP is not totally forgotten, but it's not the demonic force it was
previously. Goals change too. We've toyed with the 4th warder, and are
gearing up for a solid attempt on him. Waking the Sleeper is a goal, but
we're waiting to see what the long term effects to the server would be.
The Avatar of War is long overdue a visit, as is King Tormax, their
faction keeping them safe for the moment. Would also be nice to do nToV
in a day. Once that's all done, there's always Tunare for the hell of
it, despite the obscenely crap risk/reward ratio for the inordinate
effort it takes. Plus there's Lucin on the horizon, and whatever Gods
and ubermobs that holds...
