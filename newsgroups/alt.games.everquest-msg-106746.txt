Camping one of the spires in South Karanas pulling the static spawn and
wandering dogs. 

28 Wizard, 28 Necro, 32 Rogue.

And believe it or not, it worked. We were pulling others when the middle
spire camp would break up and leave. Hell, we were intentionally
overpulling. Necro snare, dot, dot, pet, Wizzie nukes to get it's
attention off of the necro, rogue backstabs the dog as it attempts to
catch the early nuking wizard. No real healer. (Necro feebly healed the
rogue a couple times, but usually nobody got hit.) No "true" tank. No
crowd control. (Necro wasn't bothering to mem ST. Just wasnt' needed,
even with adds. We root parked them with Enstill.)

Later on we added a 30 cleric who just joined our guild. He was very
bored, and just started nuking them with Wrath after maxing out his 1HB.
;-)

A very odd group composition. But the xp flew. I finished 27 and made it
halfway through 28 in about four hours. I should finally get bonds of
force this week, and then I can commit some SERIOUS suicide. He he he.
