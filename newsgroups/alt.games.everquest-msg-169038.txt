I've been playing about 6-8 months - but this may be a laughable, newbie
problem.  Once in a while, my keyboard seems to 'lock-up' - my mouse is
fine, but my arrow keys will no longer move me... instead, they scroll
through the buffer in my chat window like 'doskey' does:  showing the
history of my /chats, and other /commands.

I am not sure how I activate this 'feature' - can anyone identify the key I
must be accidentally hitting to cause this to occur...

sometimes, to get out of it, I hit random keys - and suddenly it's free.
Other times, I have to camp and come back.

This is very annoying, esp when it occurs in combat, as I become effectively
rooted...

TIA
