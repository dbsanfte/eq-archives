Well sorta my problem with KEI is what its doing to the game,

Look SoE has "Claimed" time and again that they know EQ is supposed to
be a grouping social game. Yet they wont even do the obvious to make
it so. When casters and hybreds grouped in Pre-Kei days its was to
avoid boring down time for a large part. That reason has been removed
now so that portion is now soloing. Look say what you will but the
portion of people that solo has gone though the roof in the last year.
Now I dunno but that makes EQ less of a game than it once was by SoEs
own admission.
