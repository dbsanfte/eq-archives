Which uberguild did they belong to?

Doesn't matter, most uberguilds somehow think that just because a few
thousand people know of them that they somehow MATTER in the real world.
The most famous guild I can think of is Flames of Heaven...or something like
that.  Initials FoH anyway, and I've been playing since 3/99 reading this
newsgroup and eq-related sites since 5/99!  If *I* can't be sure what their
name is, exactly how important could they possibly be?  I have no idea what
server they're on, either.

Questions: Who was the first person on your server to have a 60 iksar?  Who
was the first guild on your server who killed Trak the first time?  VS?
Raid Charassis?  Kill Velk?

Answer: who gives a shit?  If you (whoever) think people do, you're
deceiving yourself.  So you have the highest level cat on your server...so?
Do we give you a prize?  Publish your name & picture on the front page of
the Times?   Will people either believe you or care 6 months from now when
you say you were first?
