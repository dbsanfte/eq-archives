It is hard, its like stepping into someone elses shoes.  You havent
grown up  with it, and as you found out, its hard to arrive somewhere
in a body and be adept at it.  The spells arent necessarily in the
order you want, so even if you know you cant always find them, your
skills werent obtained by you, so, unless you just came from a lvl 25
of the same make and model, chances are, you wont be accurate with a
guess of what you can / cant handle well.

Well that makes you a nice buffee in my world. You didnt get a whole
group killed by your over keen ness..

it is tough even if you come from a class where you've been there done
that, you didnt grow up so it takes a little time to settle in.. I
think for pure melee like rogue/war/monk its probably quicker to
settle in, as you either hit or not, the extras backstab, tail rake
etc.. you probably wouldnt be expecting to solo those classes.. and
its a question of hotkeys..

For the spell casters, there are many spells, some of which are
probably unfamiliar, especially if you buffed and got the LDoN spells.
