I have had the same problem on both my machines (since the last patch)
and RL friends and guildies have also reported it.

Unlikely that this is some virus that has snuck past all out virus
scanners independantly (particularly as the only way some of us
communicate is through EQ). Can't do any harm to do a full check but I
think it much more likely that this is a EQ bug.

Wait till the next patch and check to see if it is fixed.

Cheers.
