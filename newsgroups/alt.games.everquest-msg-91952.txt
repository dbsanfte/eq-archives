It is commonly known that a lot of idiots come to the game, hear of the
Loio-OT-DL series and are still noobs around lvl 50. At that level they dive
into KC and have no real grasp of the game beyond their very limited
knowledge of OT and DL.
I've seen more noobs in DL and KC then in any newbiezone in Norrath.
