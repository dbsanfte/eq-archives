The "Portal XXX" spells are slower casting versions that snag everyone in
the group who's in range and port them to the location in question. Use
these when you're just taxiing folks around to the various zones.

The "Evacuate XXX" spells are faster casting versions that snag everyone
in the group who's in range and port them to the location in question.
They upside is that they cast fast enough you could use them to escape a
bad pull. The downside is that they have a slight chance of leaving people
behind -- possibly including the caster. Additionally, even the closest
Evacuation location may not be convenient to returning to your hunting
grounds.

The "Evacuate" spells (Evacuate and Lesser Evacuate) are faster casting
versions that snag everyone in the group who's in range and port them to
the zone "safe spot". The upside is that they cast fast enough you could
use them to escape a bad pull, they clear you from the agro list of all
the mobs in the zone, and they move you to the zone "safe spot", which is
generally closer to where you were hunting than North Karana, for example.
The downside is that they have a slight chance of leaving people behind.
They also have a "mana drain" effect on everyone, so you wouldn't just use
evac as a cheap memblur. And lastly, the zone "safe spot" is just not very
safe in some zones.

Also, note that some locations only get Evacs (Emerald Jungle, for example).
And some Evacs don't go to the same location as the Portal spells do. In
particular, Gate/Portal/Translocate Ro all take you to North Ro; while
Evacuate Ro takes you to South Ro.

FWIW, Druids get the Succor line of spells which works like Evacuate. But
the Evacuate and Succor can take you to different locations in some zones.
The Crucible of Escape (druid and wizard clicky item) has a similar effect.
Don't know offhand the CoE takes you to the Evacuate spot, the Succor spot,
or somewhere else.
