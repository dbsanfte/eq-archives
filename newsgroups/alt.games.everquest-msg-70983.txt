I'm fairly certain that a 48 cleric would get utterly munched by the
seafuries. :) Saw something recently that plugged the AC in OoT around level
40... Seafuries are invariable in that same range, if not higher, which puts
them well out of solo range for a 48 cleric, unless he's REALLY godly at
soloing with a cleric. ;)

*snicker* The most amusing part about the LGuk piece, if I'm remembering
correctly here, is that it can be difficult if, and only if you go in from
the usual UGuk zone line which brings you into the corridor leading down to
the fork - going left takes you to the area with the staff bit. The sneaky
way to get this done is to have a reasonably high swimming skill (100 will
do just fine), and not be KOS to live froggies. Just sneak over to the
UGuk->LGuk zone line near the AC (Ancient Croc!) camp in UGuk, swim a bit,
hop up onto the rock, slip into the room, and snaff the staff bit right off
the ground.

Of course, having never done the quest, and not being a wizard myself (in
any incarnation... I play a monk, and a monk's best friend (shaman)), I
could be wrong... but that's how *I'd* get the LGuk staff piece, were I to
do the quest. That method, assuming I have the right location, is 100%
danger free, so long as you aren't KOS to live frogs by default.
