}And you claim *I* am ambigious!!!???   :^)

Yes, I do.  I see nothing ambiguous about my statement.  If there's some 
part you need clarified, you'll have to be more specific.

}That was the best tap dance I have seen in a long time!!  Kudos...

Thank you, I learned all my tapdancing from Elmo.  He taught me to have 
tolerance for unusual artistic forms of expression like that.

You think that their trend of using new characters to teach more and more 
tolerance someow implies that their next character will be used for some 
alternate, subversive purpose?  You may want to consider that logic class 
some more.

It's a different tolerance.

}I believe someone listed all the muppet characters we should see, if
}tolerance is truly the concern...

Yes, I thought several of them have been done, several of them might be 
worthwhile if they feel like doing it later, and several of them were 
patently ridiculous.

But I noticed that "Illiterate, Illogical Muppet" didn't even make the 
list.
