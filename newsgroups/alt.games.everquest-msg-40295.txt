Instill Doubt...and he was probably using one of you or the boat as a
target.  Don't worry, against a PC or an object (such as a corpse)
it won't actually work, although you can gain skill raises.

Rogues get it, too, although it rarely works because of the skills used.
It checks against the skill itself (basically a fear-type "spell") and then
the "kick" skill.  Rogues don't get "kick," so it almost never works.
With maxxed skill in 60+36 levels as a rogue, instill doubt has worked
exactly 7 times against an opponent when I needed it, and much more
often against 50-level-green-to-me goblins in the Misty Thicket a lot
more :-).  It has saved my life exactly twice, including once last night
against some giants in the Great Divide.

Better than no skill at all, but I'd rather they just gave us a Kick skill
somewhere around 25 that isn't usable as an attack, or even a trainable
skill that greyed-out backstab.
