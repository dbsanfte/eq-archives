Thanks, that's exactly the info I sought. Ok, I'm impressed.

I also remember when EQ was launched that the dev team stated it would be
(two years, I think it was) before anyone reached level 50. The one lesson
that every MMOG designer should have learned long ago is that one should
NEVER underestimate the ability of the player base to accomplish ANY goal
that is technically achievable. If it can be done, it will be done. Lord
British can be killed. A Rogue can hit level 50 within a few months of
release. A froglok can hit level 65 with his epic within three days of LoY's
availability. And the Sleeper can be killed.
