I don't understand why people make groups like that for lower velk spawns.

A lot of people seem to think you NEED to have 6 people in a group.. a lot
of cases its not necessary, nor is it beneficial.

The velk spiders can be solo'd by a high 50's player with relative ease, 2
level 50's can easily kill them too, they hit so weak that crowd control
isn't really necessary (with just me running my monk and cleric, I can
handle 5 spiders all at once, a warrior with something like a willsapper
wouldn't have any problems)

Altho to agree with the post above this one I replied to.. the bigger the
group the more the healing, is generally true.  If im playing my monk and
cleric, and grouped with 2 rogue friends, anything more then 6 and were
struggling - if you can't keep all agro on 1 person you can have problems

Indicently.. i bear that in mind when i form groups also.  If I have a
warrior then I won't take a shadowknight... nor will I take 2 warriors, if i
have an SK then no warrior etc... optimal exp for me is about keeping agro
on only 1 person, only 1 person needing heals, and the cleric never needing
med breaks
