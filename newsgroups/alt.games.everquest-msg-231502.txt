Are there any low level guilds out there...
Reason for my question is that I have limited exp in actual game play (we
were all new once).  I have noticed low level people in guilds who are
getting a new character and I only assume that they get buffed and so on
from others in the guild thats ok with me. But when you check these guilds
out they demand only high level characters full of exp. Now what would
happen when I get my pathetic little character upto that level and get into
a guild perhaps having never played in any although my character may be good
I would not have a clue what to do and could quite easily make a simple
error. So surely it would be good to have lower level guilds as nothing more
than a feeder for the higher ones. So do they exist I use kane bayle and
tunare and as yet do not know of any.
