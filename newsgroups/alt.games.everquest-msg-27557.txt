Well - it all depends how much that money is not an issue....=P   I had a
very set budget and had to get the best upgrade for a set amount of money.
Had I chosen DDR ram with a compatible motherboard then for the same price I
would have a 256mb system instead of 768mb. That would have meant the swap
file would have become important...and my hard disk is a bit old...

Apparently a DDR system that is otherwise equal to a stock pc133 does about
10% better - that may be enough reason  to justify the expense for some, but
not me.
