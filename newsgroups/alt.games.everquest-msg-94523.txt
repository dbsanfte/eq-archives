  No, the "policy" is quite clear.  If you attack a mob that is already engaged
by someone else with the intention of getting credit for the kill, you are
killstealing, PERIOD.

> spawn is a spawn, you had it camped.

  According to Verant, as far as the policy is concerned, there's no such thing
as a "camp" and a person can't claim a spawn in advance (well, a person can, but
it doesn't mean anything).

  How is it bull?  He is just as entitled to hunt as anybody else.

  Just because a person or a group has a set of spawns dominated doesn't mean
they should have complete ownership over it.  What if this guy doesn't have time
to spend 15 minutes traveling to another zone where there is prey within his
level range that he can viably fight?  He has just as much a right to play as
anybody else.  What's BULL is when a group of brats decide that since they got
there first, they get to have ALL the spawns ALL the time and there is no room
for sharing.

> He could however ask you to "share" it, & a GM might enforce it.  blah

  This is correct.  It isn't worth it though... you're better off trying to find
something else to hunt if you can, or logging off if you don't have to go
somewhere else... dealing with greedy brats who insist on owning every spawn in
a camp aren't worth dealing with.

  And I'm not saying that some people who try to "move in on somebody else's
camp" are never assholes about it.  Sometimes they are, but my experience has
been that MOST of the time they're fine people who just want to make some
experience like anybody else, and some effort should be made to share.
