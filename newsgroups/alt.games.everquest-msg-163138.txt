Erm, yes I know it's capped before 60 but I couldn't remember exactly 
when so I just put 60 there. As for above 60 you might be right about it 
changing.

I saw a thread about this on some messageboard recently but 
unfortunately I couldn't find it again.. This was the closest I could find:
http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=4819

Could try starting a thread about it on eqcleric or somewhere..

Can you say horse? :) Too bad you can't use it on someone with better

The new cultural is real nice for high elf, the blessed full mithril 
stuff, how are the dwarven ones?

Yes I kept seeing people saying 1k for those too but I'd generally see 
them for 2.5-3k.. Eventually a friend of mine gave one to me (apparently 
he had been exping there one day and his group had let some 8 of these 
rot :)..

Recently my shaman buddy decided he wanted one of these so we decided to 
camp one for him. I was 59 at the time, he was 60. They drop off shadel 
bandits (as the name implies :) in fungus grove. There are two camps of 
these, the one I used you reach by following the left wall from the 
village at zone to echo caverns. I could easily single pull these with 
pacify/wot and we could easily kill them. I'm certain you could solo one 
of these at 63 without breaking a sweat. When the shammy decided he 
should be able to single pull them because he was level 60 we could 
handle the 4 that came by rootparking. I have only camped one of these 
so I can't really say how common they are, but I've heard about 1 ring 
in 10-20 bandits. Don't think you'll get exp at 63 though.

Again, can you say horse? :)

So you've noticed that too? :)


Actually, the horse part is a very good idea if you don't have one. I 
recently bought the cheapest one I could find (tan rope, 8.4k) and it 
was worth every copper. I don't have the horse models on so I don't get 
the hassles of having a horse (I run as fast with run3 as the horse 
anyways) but I meditate while standing and casting. No sitting aggro to 
worry about, just a lot more mana. Go get one.. :)
