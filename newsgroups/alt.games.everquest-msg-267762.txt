I was fairly close to the Antonica/North Queynos bridge at the time, totally 
involved in an epic battle with a bug.

After considering further, I suspect what happened is that someone was in 
over their head with the mob, ran to the guard and unlocked, then before the 
guard could clear them, one of the mob members dispatched my poor 
head-up-his-butt fighter.  :-)

It still seems like possible griefer fodder, though.
