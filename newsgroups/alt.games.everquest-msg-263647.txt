I'm not totally up on gate items. If you were a cleric or a shaman,
there are tradeskilled items for perma-gate spells. Druid's are
able to have a perma-succor tradeskill item, but that's not gate.
There is a one-shot gate item called a Vial of Velium Vapors, but
that's tradeskilled, too.

Don't know of any quested items though.
