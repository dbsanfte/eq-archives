How so? If a person playing EQ off and on for five years who doesn't have a
guild (maybe they're not into guilds) just wants to get some of the "oober"
gear the guildies have. S/he has been playing and grouping for years. How
could you tell the gear was bought?

He's also going to have to compete with the increased camping for items. If
MS says they're going to sell ingame items you know some people will think
it's open season for them to start harvesting items themselves.

There is a big difference between ingame money and real money.

I'll agree with you here. What does impress me is someone who can overcome
the challenges the game gives them and gains the super-cool magic item.
Just opening a wallet does not.
