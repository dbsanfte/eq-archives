	Hmmmm well I'm not at all an uber raid cleric BUT...  I find
I'm more worried about making sure the tank holds aggro than if he can
take 1.5 or 2 rounds of hits...  As long as he can hold aggro so that
I don't pull heal aggro from healing as fast as I can between HOT and 
spammed fast heals I can heal about 4K per click.  That seems to be plenty
for almost anyone to survive at these levels.

	I've clericed for lots of sub-optimal :-) tanks like
6K hp rangers and beastlords ("Heal the pet!" :-) on non-uber stuff
like BoT and hard LDON.  I don't care about your HP just make sure that
thing isn't chasing me around the room.
