I played UO and found the same complaints the author finds in AC, EQ, and
DAOC.

I used EZ Macros to get my characters main combat skills into the mid 80s,
then I sparred with guildmates into the 90s, then it was on to the
monotonous dungeon crawls, killing the endlessly respawning creatures, to
achieve my first 100.

Wash, rinse, repeat to get additional skills to 100.

Now, who's fault is it that I didn't enjoy the game?
