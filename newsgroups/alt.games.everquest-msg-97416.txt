Please follow along.  I am not the first person who has mentioned the
feared influx of LCD players.  I may be using a slightly broader
interpretation of griefer than you prefer, but I know several former
coworkers who were ACTIVE grief players in whatever game they played.
They hated EQ because it took too long to get up to the level where
they could cause grief.  Now it's easier.  Hopefully they've grown up.
