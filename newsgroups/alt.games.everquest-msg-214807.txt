   I would imagine that this would different to a certain degree from
server to server.  But overall, I would be inclined to say either rogue
or bard.  Though with release of LDoN, I think that alot of new rogues
are going to be born or dusted off.

   I'd go into more details, but I had a partial root canal this
morning, and am now seriously buzzing from the vicoden the doctor gave
me.  My jaw still hurts, but I don't really care.  And I can feel my
hair growing.
