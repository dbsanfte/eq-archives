Yes, a misunderstanding.  You are asserting that swinging the
weapon faster will get you more procs in the same amount of
time.  You are assuming that the chance of a proc on any given
swing is unaffected by haste.  I am saying that I have seen no
evidence in support of this, or against it for that matter, so
your assumption is unwarranted.  EQ's combat resolution is
strikingly byzantine (or, if you prefer, Rube Goldberg'ish),
with hidden mechanics and a streaky RNG, and has at long last
taught me to assume nothing that hasn't been demonstrated.

So you are asserting that you are one of those that does not
research and looks only at the bottom line?  I certainly can't
come up with any other way to read that response.
