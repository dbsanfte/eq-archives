Depends on your moral.  You're just speeding up the inevitable.  Sooner or
later they'll get themselves comprehensively screwed on their own.  It's
not very nice though.  On the other hand, if you feel like doing this kind
of thing, be careful how you do it.  Verant has a pretty skewed idea of
what is "fair play," and some of the Guides and GMs add their own personal
spin to the letter of the law.  Don't do anything that could even remotely
get you in trouble.  (The cleric in the post, for example, just gave bad
advice.  About the location of the zone the E-dork was looking for, and
about Binding himself to Felewithe Gate.  He didn't actually cast Bind,
which would have been a completely different matter if a Guide got involved
at some point.)
