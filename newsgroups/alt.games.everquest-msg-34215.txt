That system would make for a very poor game though, where those with

make of your life financially while feeding those addictions.

I could not really play any such game because I'd have severe moral
conflicts. Plus the richer you are really the more pointless it would
be. Anarchy Online is already like that without even having to pay for
stuff.. I mean you log on and get the best stuff for your level in an
hour via run through missions, its actually easier than shopping for
stuff on ebay or something and makes the game very non challenging or
fun which is why I have not even logged in for like a week.

Yeah I also highly disapprove of those Magic the gathering and
other such card games where you have to keep on buying to play well.
They are nothing more than a scam to make the company making the game
fabulously rich as it did Wizards of the Coast who then, oddly enough,
have the capital to buy more legitimate game companies. I almost got
into warhammer 40 k table top miniature games then avoided it for the
same reason, it was obviously a game solely designed to make them lots
and lots of money.
