Thanks!

Hmm, that's a good idea, I should add a 'just this table' link, maybe.

Well... I checked lucy, and it -looks- like it stacks with anything except 
celestial tranquility (the monk epic proc).  

}I can have YV and Wonderous Rapidity icons both up
}at once, for example, and I do see the boost to my dex
}from YV.   Can't tell if I'm at 25% haste, (rumored haste
}of YV) or 70% haste (your listing for WR) or 95% haste
}(sum of the two) or 100% haste (add in haste off SBOC)
}or some other combination.

Lucy confirms the 25%, for what good that does.  I'd imagine it'd add in 
the SBOC at the very least, which, with the 70% puts you very close to the 
haste cap, so it may be hard to tell.  Do this for me:  find a greenie, 
take off your belt, get WR, equip a fairly slow weapon, turn logging on,
whack the greenie for a few seconds, then yaulp and whack some more.  
Check the difference in time for 10 swings in your log file for the 
yaulped versus non-yaulped case.  If it's the same, then the haste 
component clearly didn't stack.  Actually, might want to try a slower 
chanter haste, like quickness.  (log files are only good to the nearest 
second, so we need a slow weapon and little enough haste that it'll make 
more than a second's difference over 10 swings.  Whew! Dathor great 
hammer from umbral (delay 95) would be about right. :) )  

Lucy has generally listed 3 kinds of haste:  haste, haste v2, and haste 
v3.  The first includes item and spell haste, and the other two are the 
uber bard song hastes.  Yaulp doesn't seem to be any of these, so the 
results are kinda hard to guess.

}Bergh "want to know whether to pester the chanters for SOS or not" 
}Brelltender

My current vote would be probably.  21% for SBOC+25% from Yaulp would 
still leave you well short of cap, and even if the haste doesn't turn out 
to stack, SoS is a lot more than 25%. :)
