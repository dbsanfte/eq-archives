No.  I could look it up, but its easier to ask you to explain ;-)

Ah, clearly I was explaining something you're more informed about than
I am!   The specific example I remember was a cloned cat that was
mixed white and tabby.  The size, shape, and distribution of the white
areas and orange tabby areas where completely different on the two
cats, and the clone was the same gender as the original.

IIRC a "tabby" by definitin as two colours on each single hair, and
both males and females can be tabby (or tabby spotted with another
colour).  Only females can be tortoiseshell, with three colours
intermixed in the same area (with or without patched of another
colour).

So that two genetically identical eggs would still develop
differently, then.  Whis is what the breeders pointed out to me,
indirectly.

And then there's genetics.... seems every herp forum is filled with
questions like, "What do I get if a breed a
hypo-something-super-otherthing with a 23.456% het for albino...."

:)

Well, you know that free will thing is easy to prove.  Just get all
heterosexuals to decide to go gay, and the point can be proven by
exhaustion.
