I agree with you there, but I can't see a way to aggro the castle without 
either a) passing through the village, b) hitting castle mob purposely 
from ramps near Frenzy, or c) coming up through the pit.  I was in the 
village, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't a), plus it was a full castle train, 
not that wimpy tunnel stuff that you would pull from the village.  It's 
possible it was someone from the pit, but I *think* that you would die 
from your own train unless it's a nasty CoH without clearing aggro trick.  
All signs lead to someone deliberately training us from the ramps.
