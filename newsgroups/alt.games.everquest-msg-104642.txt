> Raiding is fun,
> but you need 5 hours at least if your gonna raid,

I disagree with that... I remember reading something yesterday, that the
uberguilds actually probably play less hours per week then a lot of other
people - mainly due to people reacting fast to get there, and fast C.R's.

Whatever the size of your guild, theres a decent mob who can be taken down
in a relatively fast time..

For smaller guilds - Lord bob and all the pits mobs in his way, can be done
in less than an hour
Guilds past that stage - Velkawhore and all the mobs in his way can be done
in less than an hour
Another step up from that, Vindicator and his guards inside 30 mins -
alternatively Rumblecrush, inside an hour
Looking higher again, the Statue inside 20 mins of Vindi dieing
Dain 1hr30
Tormy 1hour-1hr30

Or what about Phinny, VS, that big horse dude in Umbral, the Va'Dyn

The long ass raids that usually end with several wipes in my experiences,
are the cursed PoF and PoH ones /shiver
