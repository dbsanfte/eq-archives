My strategy is the same as Singha's.  I'm just so gloriously happy and
blessed that I can have a Pet.  I can solo very well, just Me and My Arrow
(old song reference).  Thus, we take out yellows and it's my job to zap the
mob and heal Ellie (my Pet's universal name).

I couldn't kill the yellow by myself, so the trade off in exp doesn't bother
me.

Now, if we could just keep the SAME pet, that still exists when I leave
Norrath, but it's there waiting loyally for me when I get back, and let it
level along with us and zone with us...whoo whoo.  No way.  OK, what about
just zoning with me.  I'd settle for that.
