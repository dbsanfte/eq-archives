Well, having played on the german server for a long time I can say
something about this. UBI did state repeatedly during the last few weaks
that they won't merge servers...ever. On the french server board there
were quite a few posts about server population and it seems ridiculous.
They said sometimes there were about 150 people online on the whole
frigging server. And this at prime time! Of course UBI did not dement
this statement once. So even while this number might be a bit low it
paints a terrible picture of the french server. The german server seems
still going quite well though EQ2 and WoW did take their toll.

All guilds recruit every class now so! Even our elusive anguish guild
feels the need to talk to the rest of the server population. ;) Of
course they aren't as evil as my statement seems to imply. :)

As it stands UBI seems willing to keep the servers as long as possible
seperated.
