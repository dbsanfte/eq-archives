The only mobs that summon is Skyfire are Ancient wyvern, guardian wurms and
ragefire / tal, and Eldrig occasionally.
I used to hunt between the OT zone and the platform where rage now spawns.
About 1/3 of the way from OT there is a
spot where the wall receeds in, that is Eldrigs spawn point. Just camp there
and pull mobs, sooner or later Eldrig will spawn. There
should usually be several grps hunting for shards for cleric epic so you
don't need to kill every mob yourself, but if you see another mob spawn
there, kill it. That was my solo hunting area
from 53 to 60 and I saw Eldrig pop there at least once every other session I
hunted there.
