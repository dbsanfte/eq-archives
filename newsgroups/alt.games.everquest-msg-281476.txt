Well I usually pulled with jolt, and snared with Entrap (aa)which is far
less aggro than Ensnare.

I would then walk behind the warrior and stand next to him until he had
aggro, if the warrior has decent taunt weapons it should only take a hit or
two.

Then back off, and shoot / melee as normal.

Its not hard really.

The spells I usually had when pulling were root, nuke, nuke, ensnare, heal,
SoE, HoN, jolt.

No reason not to have jolt up if you need it.
