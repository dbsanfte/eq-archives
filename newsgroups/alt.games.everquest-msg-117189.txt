I do have one complaint about player inspecting.  I think they should remove
this feature in a certain radius of an NPC (at least ones you can buy and
sell to).  I've been standing there buying or selling and have had players
inspect me, knowing they meant to deal with the merchant.  I've had myself
do the same to others.  It would be much easier if this couldn't happen (or
at least if we had the ability to do it, like turning off inspection
message).
    By the way...do we have the ability to turn off our ability to inspect?
Although that is a "for now" fix, I still think we should have an option to
turn it off within a certain radius from an NPC who we'd want to right click
(such as merchants and banker) as that can be annoying (even more so in
banks or crowded vendor areas).
