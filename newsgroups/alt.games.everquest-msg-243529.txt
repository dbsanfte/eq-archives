My husbands computer has the same problem, but it is not a sony vaio, it 
was a custom build that was upgraded lst year...but it would or wouldnt 
restart after unplugging and plugging back in at random. Unfortunately I 
cant tell you much about it because I cant get it to work to get the 
build info on it=\

On the advice of a friend, we replaced the power supply,no help. we 
replaced the motherboard, figuring why not...now it doesnt turn on at 
all. it is going into the shop later today so they can sacrifice a 
chicken to it and tell us what is wrong with it.

*sigh* I hate having to spend money we *don't* have=\
