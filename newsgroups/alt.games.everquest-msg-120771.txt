Our dog had a definite hierarchy of how she treated people, ranging
from my brother as God to my sister as 'tolerated, sometimes treated
affectionately but usually avoided' - I moved up in rating the last
couple years while I've been living at home and my brother's been away
at school and ended up somewhere near 'lesser Goddess whose word is
not law but can be followed anyway'. She was also extremely clever and
quite talkative, and her last years she'd sleep so much I'd call her a
cat. She also developed a 'fine old lady' complex when I took her for
walks and we met other dogs - the other dog would be yapping and
curious and she'd be acting like a queen faced with one of her lower
subjects, treating the other dog with mild interest but never storming
off after it (she sometimes even did that if she saw a cat).
Oh, and food. She'd want everything we ate, but would be fussy when
presented with dog food.
