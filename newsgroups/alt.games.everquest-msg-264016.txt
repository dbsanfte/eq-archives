What a load of crap.

A parent can FORCE the child to comply with the "request."

The   can force the victim to comply with the "request" or face damage.

Julie can't FORCE Annie to do anything.

It was phrased as a request and since there's no way for Julie to MAKE
Annie COMPLY with that request, it's nothing more than a request.

What you mean other than the fact that 42 has already admitted to using
multiple different aliases.

Loosely speaking there's 3 kinds of usenet posters.
1. The real name posters (with or without real e-mail address.)
2. The Alias using posters who use a real e-mail address (like me.)
3. The Alias using posters who use a completely fake e-mail address or a
throwaway hotmail/yahoo/etc address (Like you and 42.)

Number 3 is the choice of trolls, stalkers and other net kooks since
they are TOTALLY Anonymous and can drop that identity in a heartbeat
should it become convenient to do so.  

That's not to say that only those types fit in category 3.

It all comes down to accountability.
Type 1's and type 2's can be held accountable since they aren't
anonymous.  Real name and/or Real address has a direct link to the real
person behind them.

Type 3's have no accountability since there is no link between the
alias/address and the person behind it. 
The alias/address can be discarded instantly at any time and there will
never be anything to link it to the person who used it.


As Ross notes, quite often the better posts come from those who are
willing to be identified with those posts, not the anonymous people who
are unwilling to be linked to their own words.


The man on the stage in front of the crowd vs the anonymous voice from
the back of the crowd.

Sometimes the anonymous voices have good points, a lot of the time
they're cowardly kooks unwilling to be held responsible for the crap
they spew.
