So if we should believe you because you claim you work for Sony, why 
shouldn't we believe Verant because they work for Sony?  Or should we 
not believe you because you work for Sony, and not believe Verant 
because they work for Sony?  Or should we not believe you, and believe 
Verant?  You claim to have inside info because you work for Sony.  
Verant *does* have inside info.  Yet you seem to think that we should 
*not* believe them for the same reason we *should* believe you.  Because 
you both work for Sony.
