Working on Enchanter Epic 1.5 and need to do the Siren's Grotto piece.
I have so far found this in depth piece of information.

Head to Siren's Grotto in Velious to find and kill Faleniel of
Darkwater for the staff topper. (Faleniel: hits for about 2k,
permarooted, two ae's (slow & dd) two groupable easy) 

What this doesn't tell me is how to find him/her. How bad are the AE
attacks. If its two groupable, are they time/ep groups or two groups
equiped with Ornate level stuff. Is there a good strategy to take in
the fight. 

Any information you have would be appreciated. Links to maps and/or
walk throughs for the fight would be great. I am in a medium size
guild and getting a nice raid like this together takes some doing. I'd
like to be able to get the kill on first pass and getting repeat raids
if we get wiped bad will be hard. Especially as we bleed people to EQ2
or WOW.

Thanks in Advance,

Ken
