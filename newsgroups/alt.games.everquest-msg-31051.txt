> So. Necromancer - any good?? Or should I play another class?

If necros weren't "any good," no one would play them.

The three classes best known for their soloing ability are druids, necros
and mages.  They all have their advantages and disadvantages, but the most
important consideration is if they're fun.

No one can answer that last part besides you.  If you have a hankering to
play a necro, then by all means, go for it!  But you DO have 8 character
slots...nothing is stopping you from rolling another class if you don't
really feel like playing your necro or cleric that night.

I've got around 11 different characters on the Zeb server (2 accounts), all
11 are different classes.  Most are in their high 20s but I have a couple in
their low 50s.  Which classes I have in my 50s should make no difference to
you, since you are not me. :)
