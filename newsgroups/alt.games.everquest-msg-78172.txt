I help and buff people whenever I can, and I'm constantly
astounded by how often people will remember it and thank me
for it *months* later, or do me a favor in return citing
the time I helped them.

Just a few days ago, a guy came up to me in the Freeport
bank and gave me 6p, in order to repay something I
had done him about four months ago, he said.  I couldn't
even remember the event, myself.
