Does a successfull attack on your part (pc) have a chance to interrupt
an attack of what you're fighting (npc)?

It does *seem* like I miss a heckuva lot more when I'm getting slapped
around by a mob than when it's attention is on somebody else and I'm
just doing damage (NOT standing behind the mob, usually right beside
MT).

Also, I've heard people proclaim that a wurmy is greater than all for
damage into your lower 50's. I can't deny that it hits hard and the
#'s look nice. However, I've also noticed that due to it's high delay
I seem to take more damage during a fight with a wurmy/lupine combo
than I do with a lupine/jagged blade of mourning combo. The fight
lasts a little longer, yes, but I seem to take less damage

My apologies if this is a stupid question but like I said, it seems
like I take less damage when using the lower delay weapons.
