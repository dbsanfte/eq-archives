Well, you are making two wrong assumptions there: I neither hate EQ (I 
still think it's the best MMORPG out there), nor am I playing it (not 
since I got CoH, at least). But if SoE are going to go down the road of 
outside sponsorship of in-game items, I will not be renewing my account. 
I'm sorry that you appear to have a problem with that.
