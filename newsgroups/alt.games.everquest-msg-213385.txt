There are several issues from the last patchs as you can see by the
zones being taken down one at a time to patch the servers. FR have
dropped and it does result from whatever untested dumbassed shit SoE
pulled this time to squeeze an extra dime outa the bandwidth. Raids
are getting very odd, horrid lag in zones where no problems existed
before, targeting problems and even hotbuttons acting odd. Different
symptoms same cause is my bet. For now turn off all the Luclin models
you can, might help. Anyway it aint your system.
