Actually, looking at Neko's little line there, the major flaw in the
logic comes here: All cartoons are animated, but not all animations
are cartoons. Technically, all movies are animated. They're all a
series of moving images, which is, by definition, what animated means
(in said context). By Neko's logic, we're going to have to start
referring to the characters in the LotR movies as "toons".
