OK, how about this.  There may or may not be a god.  I personally
would prefer to think there is none.  If there is one I'm pretty much
certain that the god of judeo/cristian/muslim belief systems is -not-
the one and if by chance I'm wrong there, well he's sure as Brell
not worthy of worship, I mean, what an Asshole of a diety!  On
the other hand I can certainly not deny that it would make a difference,
that Guy is all about consequences of not giving him his props.

You say that an agnostic claims there are no consequences to
belief or disbelief.  IF thats inherant in the definition then I'm
something else.

Here's another thought chain.  A deity is often inferred by looking
at existance and deciding that it could not have occured by chance.
However, the existance of a diety would logically lead to the
same inferences... did the diety evolve by chance?  Clearly he requires
his own creation myth, or else his existance without a prior cause
destroys the syllogism that demanded his existance in the first place.
Likewise a "creator of god" must either have arisen out of less
than that, or have its own creator.  This chain either ends at some
point or is infinite, any ending destroys the arguement that created
it and an infinite result is meaningless.  Calculus of Agnostism; there
is no Supreme Being, while there may be Superior Beings who
may have created us (and all of existance as we know it) we can
nevertheless rely on their lack of perfection as a given.

Put a different way, "its turtles all the way down"
