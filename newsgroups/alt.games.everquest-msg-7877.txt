For what it's worth... here is the official word:

We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters
moved from one server to another, or from one account to another.
Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that we
receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and economies, and
other problems associated with character moves, we can not move characters
across servers or accounts.
It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a server
remain on that server. We also feel that it is important that characters
that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live with the
consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to retreat from that
reputation by changing servers.

The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a large
number of characters to new servers. At no other time will we move a
character in such a fashion.
