It's not that bad once you hit 60. 
- Group focus - 90 minute duration. 
- Group Stamina and Acumen - 60 minutes. 

I'll usually have a druid along to do group regen so that only leaves
haste if there isn't an enchanter in the group.  Primal Essence,
single target but lasts an hour, I'll occasinally do, depending on the
group.  Group agility might get added to the mix after I hit 62 this
weekend, haven't decided yet. 

I will make an exception for clerics. If they want seperate Dex and
Str, along with haste, I'll give it to them even if I don't think
cleric melee is really worth it. Their job is boring enough as it is.
I figure it's karma, payback for all those levels before I had torpor
when it often seemed like the clerics main job was to keep me in
hitpoints so I could canni fast enough to keep the melees hasted and
the mobs slowed. 

Now in the old days (especially 60 and HoS), you'd join a group and
the first thing would be:
Warrior_01 tells you: Sow, regen, haste, Tuna, str, dex, agi and
stamina plz! (I kid you not)
You tell Warrior_01: You sure you don't want charisma too, it also has
a pretty icon? Here's haste and sow, now go pull something. 

Rgds, Frank
