Yes, but don't fool yourself into thinking it will make a big
difference. Once you hit level 16 you will get Feign Death, and most
of your "escape" worries will be over.

You can group with players level 8-18 at (level 12). If you can't find
anyone at all, then forget about exp and stay near the zone line. Farm
the green Kobolds for Bronze and faction. At level 12 (I'm pretty sure
that your higher level summoned pet can hit magical) you could also go
to Erud's Crossing and kill Willowisps for exp lightstones/greater
lightstones.
