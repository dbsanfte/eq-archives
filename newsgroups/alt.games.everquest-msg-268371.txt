I wouldn't think so.
EQ1 is still profit and lots of it on a steady basis.
EQ2 is still expense and capital costs.

True. Even if DaoC, AO, shadowbane etc were free, I don't think I'd have the
time to play them but I would stop in from time to time perhaps.
Time and Money. We all only have so much of it.

Don't get me wrong. I don't think EQ1 will live forever.
The crowds leaving and guild woes are just like I remember from when DaoC
hit though.

I haven't tried EQ2 yet so I don't know how different of a game it really
is.
If it is really different I wouldn't be surprised to see a big influx of
returnees to EQ1 after the new year.

I see EQ1s demise being a very slow death. Who knows maybe EQ2 will die
first../shrug
Top 3 uber guilds with a 100 members all quitting still represents a small
percentage of the player base.
The biggest thing EQ1 has going for it is the amount of time people have
played their characters.imo of course
